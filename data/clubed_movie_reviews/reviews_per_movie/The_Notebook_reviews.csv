A touching movie,"My wife and I watched this movie when it was first released and enjoyed it whilst acknowledging its manipulative aspects. I do get the bad reviews. We watched it again today while in lockdown due to coronavirus. We are now in our late 70s. For us the subject of the central relationship was very close to home both in the development of the love of the central characters and in the enduring nature of that love in their twilight years. It's easy to be cynical about a movie such as this but, boy, does it pack a punch when you've lived it.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
"My Favorite Scene was the One with the Geese, not the Gosling","Prior to watching ""The Notebook,"" I was not familiar with the work of the actress Rachel McAdams. She made an indelible impression by sustaining an outstanding performance in this film. Her character Allie is the pivotal role in the film, as she must make the crucial romantic decision on which the story turns. There are few performers capable of evolving the complexity of characterization as achieved by Rachel McAdams.The film recreated effectively the world of the 1940s in America, including the parental pressure exerted by the well-to-do family of Allie on whether to allow their daughter to pursue a young man from the other side of the tracks. As played by Ryan Gosling, the character of Noah could have revealed more emotional layers. There was only one scene in the film where he really showed that there was something at stake in his love for Allie. He apparently wrote her a passionate letter every day for a year. Especially in the film's early scenes, Gosling could have shown more of the passion.The other cast members were outstanding, including James Garner and Gena Rowlands in the parallel story. In the two plots, ""The Notebook"" merits comparison with another outstanding romantic film, ""The Bridges of Madison County."" As the two subplots of ""The Notebook"" come together, one of the key characters is Allie's mother. As always, Joan Allen delivers a convincing and complete character portrayal, as the well-intentioned, but conflicted mother. In one of the most moving scenes in the film, the mother opens up to the daughter and tells her story of youthful love and a fateful choice similar to the one Allie herself must face.My favorite scene in the film: a wonderful sequence where Noah and Allie are in a boat in the backwaters of South Carolina. The waterway is simply filled with white geese. It is a stunning and picturesque moment, among many in this well-crafted film. If there is such a spot in South Carolina, then I want to go there!",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
the notebook was a truly remarkable film,"In all honesty, my Dad paid me to go see the Notebook with my friends because he kept saying how magnificent it was. i went because it was free, and with no expectations. However, the Notebook drew me into the story from the beginning right up until the credits- and then kept me crying for quite some time after it had ended. I, along with almost every other person i have discussed the movie with, felt involved in the situations and the lives of the character- crying at the sad moments and feeling joy at the happy bits. in general, love stories are predictable and somewhat dull (in my opinion) yet this movie kept me guessing at the outcome, and delivered twists throughout the whole film.The Notebook was extremely well constructed and i would give it an eleven out of ten.",,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Beautiful,"I went to see this film with my sister and my Mum and we were the only ones in the cinema. Not the best start, but I continued to watch it anyway and am so glad I did. This is probably one of the most beautiful and romantic films I have ever seen! From the relationship of the two characters to their surroundings, every scene is breathtaking! The Notebook tells the story of a summer romance that turns into a romance never to be forgotten. Allie and Noah are the two lead characters and they are wonderful. You immediately fall in love with the characters and you want to follow every step of their doomed love story. it is one of the greatest love stories ever told. Look out for the lake scene, unbelievable! I came out of the cinema wanting to go back in again and watch it all over again. It feels like you are reading a diary watching this film, thats how detailed and wonderful this film is. Cannot really give too much away about the story, all I can say is if you haven't seen this film yet, be sure to see it. I cannot think of a film more perfect for Valentines Day!",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
SImple but wonderful,"This movie seems to be postcard perfect, a lesson straight out of the director's guide to romantic movies. Boy meets girl at a carnival, love from the other side of the tracks, a date by the water, etc. And yet the wonderful thing about this movie is that it takes what seems like a story you've heard already (at least in bits and pieces) and still moves you deeply. It really speaks about love in a way that most romantic movies miss by speaking in clich√© or over shoot by adding in numerous complications to dramatize things. There have been other great movies to comment on love in recent years (Eternal Sunshine, Lost In Translation jump to mind) but this movie fills a need that those other movies miss: the need for a straight, sweep you off your feet romance. Too bad there can't be movies like this every year...",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Just beautiful!,"This amazing love story can be enjoyed by all. The Notebook is not one of those cheesy chick flicks that often come out, it is a brilliantly written intriguing story about two young lovers that most people can relate to.Even most males will agree that this movie pulls at your heart strings. Filled with fabulous quotes, and sentimental moments I found this movie to be one of the best I've seen. I got to know both main characters and found myself relating to each of them. Most of us remember our first love and that strong connection we had with them. This movie makes us think of what could have been and gives us a fresh look at the meaning of true love. I recommend this movie to anyone with a heart.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Good but doesn't know when to end,"Nothing new...... you would have seen this story a hundred times. But what elevates this movie from others in the genre is the performances by Ryan Gosling and Rachel Mcadams . You truly believe they are in love.That's why the part of the movie set during the 1940s works. What doesn't work is the modern day story set in a hospital. It just feels distracting , butting in the middle. All the time you're just itching to get back to the story in 1940s. It also leads to a long drawn ending where you wish they had ended the movie long before.The notebook maybe overly sentimental and manipulative for some. But it is not cynical in it's portrayal of romance. It truly believes in the story it tells.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Unabashedly Romantic  and Sentimental.  It's Storytelling at its Best,"This story plays out as Duke, played by James Garner, reads a story about two young people in the 1940s who fall in love and endure life. The movie moves between present-day and the 1940s. It is structurally very similar to ""Fried Green Tomatoes"", which is also one of my all time favorite movies.Unlike ""Fried Green Tomatoes"", this focuses on young love as it grows and endures through wars and parental dissent. Sure, the core is the ""Romeo and Juilet"" theme, but the way is plays out and the exceptional charisma that the actors bring to the screen make it feel fresh and not entirely predictable. This is a deeply romantic movie. If you are cynical at all about romance, timeless love and dedication to another person, you may find yourself rolling your eyes a bit. I am not that cynical about the emotional ties that bind us and I was thoroughly taken in by the story.This is such a gentle movie. The characters are very human and very likable. All of the actors turn in engrossing and compelling performances.Technically, this movie is exceptional, too. The scenes during the opening credits is absolutely breathtaking. The editing is very good. The story is compelling from the opening credits to the closing credits.My wife and I don't always share the same perspective on movies, but we agreed on this one. We both loved it immensely. I am certain this will become part of our permanent collection.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
"Mostly enjoyable, but also too formulaic and overly sentimental","Overall, nice little movie. But it is also a bit 'tricked out.' That is, it is a bit manipulative and overly sentimental. I LIKE romantic movies, generally, and even some intensely emotional ones. I even cluck-cluck when film critics attack anything with strong emotions, or too-real humanity, mentally scolding them for their shallow self-anointed mantel of the too-cool.Point is, I usually defend the 'sentiments' of humanity in movies! But here, I was (and to my great surprise) put off a bit by some of the formulaic vibe of the movie. It was kind of corny, and silly, and inauthentic. Again, though, it was nonetheless watchable. I gave it a 6 out of 10, and would have posted a 6.5 if I could have.James Garner is magnificent in everything. Gena Rowlands is good, and good here. The guy, Ryan Gosling, may be a great human being, but his screen persona is too creepy for me (recall his total creep-out role in 'Murder by Numbers'). The chick was good--- Somebody Mc-Something. Don't know her name or work yet, but assume she will continue with a good career, and then everyone will know her.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
An Heartwarming movie that makes your insides go mushy with emotions!!!,"I went into this movie with the misconception of thinking this was just another typical romantic movie, but I was very impressed by this film and the themes portrayed in this movie were handled in a great way.This movie will have you feeling happy and joyful and the scenery is just brilliant. You will feel like you are part of the characters, and you will care about them throughout the whole movie.The movie gallops in speed as we are absorbed into the great plot and brilliant acting of all the cast involved. Ryan Gosling is brilliant as the shy and quiet Noah, and Rachael McAdams is superbly beautiful as the star of the movie, Allie.As I said earlier in my review, I did go into the movie not expecting much and that was because I thought it was a typical ""boy loves girl"" movie which are sometimes just too predictable. Don't get me wrong, they are some good Romantic movies that pull it off very well, but there are simply too many in that particular genre.The best thing about this movie was the depth of the plot and the actors playing their characters so well. The supporting cast were good, and James Marsden deserves a mention for managing to pull of a hard role as the ""rich man"" well. Another plus point about this movie was the great script, and you did not see too many ""cliches"" which is always a good sign in a Romance movie.It does not matter whether you love romantic movies or hate them, this is NOT just a romantic movie it is so more than that. By the end of the movie you will feel a whole heap of emotions. You will be talking about this movie for a long time.The only bad part about this movie is the length, which I think could be shortened a bit but on the whole this was a superb movie which is well worth a watch.Go and Watch this! Amazing movie which will have you brimming with joy.9 1/2 out of 10",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Must-Cry Movie,"The typical chick flick, as you could of assumed. The movie you see with your girlfriend. If you don't cry at the end, some questions are gonna be raised. Suddenly, you're not sensitive, and the relationship drops a rung on the sex ladder.This 2 hour long movie depicts a love story read by an aged husband to his wife who has a disease (something like alzheimers) and she forgets things easily. He reads to her their love story, and every time he does, she remembers just a little bit more about the relationship they have.Not my kind of movie, but I gave it a 7 out of 10, because it was good nonetheless. I'm just not a crying for every movie kind of guy, I felt sincerity for the ending, and my eyes were on the verge of watering, but it just didn't work for me. On a sad, crying ending scale, it would receive a 6. If you want to cry at the end of a movie, and still watch something that keeps your attention... rent Con Air.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Shallow and sugar coated to the point of becoming disturbing,"It's not that I dislike romance anything but this has movie tries so hard to be some sort of acronym to the word ""chick flick"" that it ends up shooting you to death with it's intended love arrows. Now could it be that I can't relate the alleged lovers in this movie? I mean I wasn't born in the 30s, I'm not a soldier so I was never in any wars (haven't we seen enough WW2 stories by the way?) and of course I don't have any family as of yet. But surely the universal power love is something everyone can relate to? Especially when depicted by a movie that uses no other element to drive its plot. Think again, the definition of love shown in this film is so naive, sugar-coated and completely oblivious of anything in the real world that it makes Star Wars look like something from the Discovery channel.The so called ""couple"" in this film are only in love because the movie says they are, not because there's any sort of chemistry between the actors and not because the characters themselves even act like. Even Allie's alleged interest in painting felt so tacked on shallow and fake it made my head hurt. Speaking of Allie, it actually infuriates me to see the character acting like she has absolutely no control over her libido because the sex is just about the only thing the couple seems to have in common, and the only thing, aside from arguing, that they enjoy doing together. And yet this movie is supposed to be oh so romantic.It's by some small miracle that this movie got the raving reviews it did, luckily it seems most of those were given by teenage girls and their tool boyfriends (no Oscars or anything) so I don't have to completely give up on humanity yet. If one day your girlfriend suddenly shows up all lyrical about this movie and wants it to ""share it with you"" I'd strongly advise any guy to end that relationship pronto. Your girlfriend will obviously already have built up her own twisted fantasy of what a relationship should be like, a fantasy that no guy, live or dead, could possibly live up to. Stay away.",1.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Brilliant movie,"The story is so great. It's something that everyone wants to achieve; true love. As a guy I'm a bit ashamed of saying so, but this is my favorite movie hands down. I love every single aspect of this movie. To be honest I also watch it when I'm alone. And the acting is pretty great for a Romantic movie, not so clich√©. Long story short, it's the best romantic movie ever made. Way better than the titanic, that one is not so great of you look at the story. This movie has the best combination of being a nice romantic movie but not that it's too much of an clich√©. I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes romantic movies. Especially great to watch with a loved one!",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Moves you deeply,"The Notebook is one of my all-time favourite movies. Its a constant, and classic love story that makes you feel as if you are there watching it.. as if you are one of the characters, which makes the impact of the story just that much more real. There really are no words to describe how this movie makes you feel, but one thing is for sure... It will make you feel. After watching it, i've often just.. sat where i am and just thought about it. It's just one of those movies that you will think about 30 years after watching it, and still get that same feeling in your heart.. and you'll know that it touched you in one way or another.

I have not been so moved by a movie before!,"I am a big fan of love stories. Lately, the film industry has been lacking the sort of element that I love to see in a movie. The last movie I saw that made me cry as much as ""The Notebook"" did was ""Ghost"" with Demi Moore. The casting of Allie and Noah in the movie was exceptional and made the feelings and emotions seem real. After watching the movie in the theater, I noticed every person, including the men, cry as they left the theater. Now when was the last time you saw anything like that?? I bought the movie on DVD the day it came out and have been watching it everday since that day!! I would highly recommend this movie to both males and females.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
I have yet to see a film this decade that touched me as much as The Notebook did,"I didn't see the movie or read the book until fairly recently, and to be honest I wasn't expecting to love either. The book I fell in love with immediately, it was beautifully written and honest with one of the most heartfelt endings I have yet to read in a book. The film is every bit as good. I have seen movies that have moved me massively(ie. The Elephant Man), however The Notebook for me is the only one this decade that completely touched me. It is wonderful to look at, has a lovely soundtrack, a touching story and a great script. The direction also makes sure that the film hits all the emotional buttons, which it does. Even the happy moments made me cry tears. The acting is great not only from Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams(who are great together as well) but from Joan Allen, Gena Rowlands, James Marsden and the old pro James Garner. In conclusion, very touching and a must watch whether you like the genre or not. 10/10 Bethany Cox",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
well made traditional romance,"In a nursing home, Duke (James Garner) reads a romantic story to an old lady (Gena Rowlands) with dementia. The story starts at a carnival in 1940. Noah Calhoun (Ryan Gosling) meets young heiress Allie Hamilton (Rachel McAdams) spending the summer in Seabrook. Noah won't take no for an answer. She eventually let her guard down and spends the summer with the lumber yard worker. Her parents do not approve but let the summer fling go on. Near the end of the summer, they visit an abandoned house called The Windsor Plantation. They are interrupted by Fin (Kevin Connolly) who tells them that her parents had sent out the police for them. He wants to let her go, they fight, and break up. While attending Sarah Lawrence College, Allie's mother (Joan Allen) kept all of Noah's letters. Noah goes to enlist to fight in WWII and Allie volunteers as a nurse. She meets wounded soldier wealthy Lon Hammond Jr (James Marsden). Noah decides to rebuild the plantation house hoping that Allie will return to him.Nicholas Sparks has made a living writing these melodramatic romances. This one has slightly more depth. First there is the power of the Rowlands Garner pairing to give it weight. Their performances keep this grounded and show what real acting is. They are so good that even cheesy dialog sounds great. But what makes this movie stand out is the chemistry between Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams. These are two charismatic personalities and they put a lot of energy into their characters. Gosling has the mischievous cool while McAdams has the adorable spirit. I love that they fight harder than most sappy love story. The fighting generates so much passion. Rowlands' son Nick Cassavetes is directing and he does a good job. The fact that James Marsden isn't playing a douche allowed more believable chemistry between Lon and Allie. I like that the choices aren't laid out as good and evil.I don't particularly like that Noah saw Allie and Lon together. It's too coincidental. It's one of many things in this that is too written. Why 365 letters? Couldn't he write one more? It's another cheesy poetic turns that Sparks like so much. Overall, this is a traditional romance done very well staring two very photogenic big personalities.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
That's my sweetheart in there......,This has to rank amongst the greatest love story of all time. This is what you call eternal love.The actings are superb throughout.

"Like mother, like daughter. Southern Belles.","My only excuse for going to see this film was the heat and humidity of the day. It must have been 90 degrees and 200% humidity in the shade! The temperature made me do it!Nick Cassavettes' style of direction is completely opposite of his father's, the otherwise innovative and genial late John Cassavettes. In electing to film this light weight book, he chose a possible easy crowd pleaser, or an excellent way to get me out of the sun into the air conditioning of the movie theater.The story is one clich√© after another. The worst of the film is Ryan Gosling, an actor that must have a good agent behind him because if he had to rely on his acting abilities, he'd starve to death. Rachel McAdams is irritating as Allie, the rich Southern girl at the center of the story.Gena Rowland's Alzheimer's is cinematic! Being confined to a nursing home, she is groomed lovingly; her gorgeous shade of blonde, is maintained by the attentive staff! Talk about a reality check! This film stretches one's imagination big time.How about David Thornton, as Allie's father. Was young Nick Cassavettes aware that he comes on the screen as the worst possible non-Southern stereotype in the movies throughout the ages?I always have to think twice about comments in this forum calling for an Oscar consideration so early in the year. Come next February, let's hope the colleagues of these ""stars"" will forget about them and of this unfortunate silly film.Don't say you weren't warned.

"Bad Script, Good Actors.","The Notebook was a movie made great by the actors on screen. The storyline is amazingly predictable and most of the lines are cheesy. The special effects, are not so great either. However, I would recommend that anyone and everyone should see this movie for one reason: Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams together on screen. I have never in my life seen two people who had as much chemistry between them as this. What they posses together blew me away and made me glad that I paid to see this movie. The two connected extremely well and made me believe their love and why they would go through such a tragedy for it. On the negative side, Nicholas Sparks is not my favorite author, I did not enjoy ""A Walk to Remember"" for two reasons, Mandy Moore, and the predictable plot line which always appears in Nicholas Spark's novels. But, thankfully, I was able to overlook such blunders and see the core of the movie, Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

Didn't Love It or Hate It; Just Wish It Had Lived Up to Its Potential,"""The Notebook"" is one of those love it or hate it movies.""The Notebook""'s champions insist it is one of the greatest love stories of all time. ""The Notebook""'s detractors savage it as a manipulative, mawkish soap opera.I didn't love it or hate it. I saw a lot of good in it, but it didn't really move me, and given how much it had going for it, I wish it had lived up to its potential. In fact I find it kind of sad that so many loved this mediocre movie so much. That just shows what a huge appetite there is for non-violent, family friendly movies that celebrate old fashioned values like committed love.The best thing about the movie, for me, was Gena Rowlands' performance as an Alzheimer's sufferer. Gena Rowlands is one of those truly magical performers who bottle lightening, and firelight, in their performances. She is exciting and seductive.I worked with Alzheimer's sufferers for years, and Rowlands' exacting and yet poignant performance took my breath away. I would have to guess that Rowlands' studied Alzheimer's sufferers and crafted her performance from meticulous and compassionate observations.It was also great to see a movie that spent so much time with a female character, and actress, over forty.James Garner's -- entirely unnecessary -- removal of his shirt was challenging to watch. I remember Garner from films like ""The Americanization of Emily"" where he was ripely sexy.That was a long time ago, though, and Garner looks his age, and the movie doesn't spare us what time has done to him. His lips are blistered; his teeth have black spots; his body is spongey and thick.But I came to be grateful for that. There's something to be said for a movie that doesn't shy from viewing an old man's body.Garner is all the more impressive in that body. He still possesses and exercises the cocky command of his youth. In his love scenes with Rowlands, he gives his all, and his all is awesome to observe.The sets, lighting, and costumes are all lush.Ryan Gosling, who tears up in fifty percent of his scenes, is very sweet and dear, and Rachel MacAdams comes across as spunky.For all that -- this movie never came together for me. It was just too much of a Hallmark card, of a Thomas Kinkade painting. Everyone, without exception, is nice; everything glows; nothing is too challenging and no one is too smart. In fact, it's all just a wee bit afraid of being too intelligent, too challenging.The movie hearkens back to another era: the 1940s, in which much of the plot is set. Too, the tear-jerking, five handkerchief plot, with its unlikely twists, hearkens back to older unlikely tear jerkers like ""Random Harvest."" The thing is, though, those older films were not afraid of intelligence, or of the darker side of life. Yes, they were movies that an entire family could sit down and watch together, but they, often through subtle suggestion, evoked life's complexities. Even Frank Capra did this; suicide was a repeated theme in his most upbeat movies, including ""It's a Wonderful Life."" And Capra was not afraid of some very dark characterizations.Ultimately, ""The Notebook"" fails its brilliant cast, and its audience, ravenously hungry, in this age of teen - boy - exploding - monster movies, for dialogue-, story-, and character-driven movies that celebrate women of all ages, and timeless virtues.In spite of its failures, though, one could do worse than pop some corn and settle in for a couple of hours with ""The Notebook.""",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Beautiful tribute to love,"""The Notebook"" is a story of love, specifically of the Love between Noah (played by Ryan Gosling and James Garner)and Allie (played by Rachel McAdams and Gina Rowlands).This movies should touch everyone's heart that watches it. There is not a person that hasn't felt drawn back toward a first love, nor is there a person who doesn't wish for and look for a love that will last a lifetime - someone to be passionate with, to laugh with, to argue with, to be with when things are difficult and to grow old with.This movie is a tribute to a love that surpasses all other loves.

A Great Love Story,"This was one of the greatest love stories that I have ever had the pleasure of experiencing. Ryan Gosling was, as always, authentic in his portrayal of Noah, a poor working class guy who falls in love with Allie, a beautiful rich girl who is staying in town with her family on their summer's vacation. The relationship is not well received by Allie's parents which leads Noah to make a decision that he feels is in both of their best interests. The result of a hastily made decision leads our main character down a road that first shuts out true passion as he tries to forget his past hurt. But, a stint in the military, where he experiences loss as well as his loss at home following his service in the military, leads him right back to his heart. The story is deep and bittersweet, but ultimately rewarding. It doesn't get any better than this. Wow!",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Touching and somewhat original.,"I must admit I'm not a huge fan of romance movies, in fact I don't even remember the last time I've seen one that I haven't fell asleep through or laughed at. But after dodging my wife's request to watch with her after she rented it a week ago, I finally yielded so I can move on with my life and ended up being somewhat impressed.""The Notebook"" is really a two-sided story regarding an elderly man (James Garner) in home that reads a love story to another elderly woman on a daily basis. The love story itself is about two love birds in the beginning of adulthood and troubled by various obstacles in life like her overbearing parents and his lack of ""successfull"" lifestyle. Noah (James Gossling) plays a free-spirited, blue collared lumber yard worker that is smitten by Allie, (nicely played by Rachel McAdams) a rich, southern belle with strict parents looking to break out of her mold. Yes, it's somewhat a ""Dirty Dancing"", bad boy/good girl tug-of-war relationship, but the movie delves deep into their lives and you soon forget the typical clich√©d baseline.The acting is pretty good, and quite exceptional for Rachel McAdams whose has played career draining, teen queen roles in the likes of ""Mean Girls"" and another Rob Schnieder flop ""Hot Chick."" Seriously, she must have one of the best agents in the business to pull for a deep role that required acting, and pulled it off. Gossling does a somewhat notable job as the nomad lover and of course James Garner is James Garner. The story of Gossling and McAdams, coupled with the relationship between Garner and the other elderly woman is what really puts this movie together. The ending is pretty predictable along with most of the plot, but in the end it all pays off.If you're not a romance fan and totally dismiss movies like this I don't blame you. But, at least give it a chance when you're totally burnt out of other movies or if your significant other is jonesing for a chick flick, pick this one up.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Love is complete.,"I watched a movie very much like a fairy in the early morning
This is a simple love story, a pair of first lovers experienced all kinds of joys and sorrows and finally broke through. Romantic and beautiful.
However, what makes people feel different is that the whole story is interspersed in the memories of old age. The old man reads this past story to his wife who has lost his memory.
They have been together for a lifetime and have sons and granddaughters. He still had to accompany her in the last time, waiting for a miracle.
He said, because she is my baby.
At the end of the story, she finally remembered him. Although only a short time.
She cried and embraced him and told him I love you.In the midnight ward, he walked quietly to her bed and called her gently.
She opened her eyes and looked at him, calling his name. Noah, do you believe that our love will work wonders?
He said, I believe, so I will bring you back to my side.
The tears in her eyes were crystal clear. Will our love take us away?
Our love is infinite.

The best love  movie i've seen,"Although they're fun to watch, most love movies are predictable after seeing the first five minutes. The Notebook, however; keeps you glued to the t.v and guessing. Rachel Mcadams' character is a more sweet and disciplined rich girl who she plays beautifully. Ryan Gosiling also brings out the best in his character and together they make the perfect couple. I'm not much of a romantic, but the scenes of them together are really not easy to put into words. All i can say is that, if you're a love movie person, it's the movie for you.

Hmmm...,"OK, this film is romantic, it has a beautiful story and cute and appealing actors, but ... all that did not really convince me to share the opinion of many here to give higher note.Early on in the film you understand who is the elderly couple and the man who reads from the notebook. The story is beautiful and I guess this is the kind of love we all wish to happen in our lives, but aside from that wish ( which may affect our rating) I don't see this film as anything more moving or extraordinary than hundreds of others...I admit that the era of 30's and 40's is really done good. James Marchal was good in his role as well as Ryan and the main girl, but, although everything is pretty much OK, the film did not move me in any particular way - and some films do move me or make me cry.Six from me.

Fantastic,"It's my film of the year so far. Forget about the clich√©s, the seagulls, Allie the elder's tasteful turnout etc, this is a first class love story. The mix of the present and the past was exceptional, Noah and Allie present and past was acted very convincingly.An exploration of senile dementia and the test to see if real love can break the barriers that medicine can't. Can a teenage summer romance last a lifetime?I thought the scene where Noah's girlfriend comes to visit was very well done, even though later on Allie's fickleness is a bit upsetting. And while you know or think you can guess how it will end there are a few subtle slight swerves to keep you guessing. Will Allie have an accident, who is the old guy Duke, Noah or Lon? And Gena Rowlands was fantastic as the Allie the elder, I almost fell in love with her myself and I am 30 years younger.

Beautiful and Sensitive Romance,"In a nursing home, the resident Duke (James Garner) reads a romance for an old woman (Gena Rowlands) that has senile dementia with memory losses. In the late 30's, the wealthy seventeen years-old Allie Hamilton (Rachel McAdams) is spending summer vacation in Seabrook. The local worker Noah Calhoun (Ryan Gosling) meets Allie at a carnival and they soon fall in love with each other. One day, Noah brings Allie to an ancient house that he dreams on buying and restoring and they make love. But Allie's parents do not approve their romance since Noah belongs to another social class and they travel to New York with her. Noah writes 365 letters to Allie, but her mother Anne Hamilton (Joan Allen) does not deliver them to her daughter.Three years later, the United States joins the World War II and Noah and his best friend Fin (Kevin Connolly) enlist to the army and Allie works as a nurse of the army. She meets the injured soldier Lon Hammond (James Marsden) in the hospital. After the war, they meet each other and Lon, who is wealthy and handsome, proposes Allie. Meanwhile Noah buys and restores the old house and many people want to buy it. When Allie accidentally sees the photo of Noah and his house in a newspaper, she feels divided between her first love and her commitment with Lon. Meanwhile Duke stops reading to the old lady since his children are visiting him in the nursing home.""The Notebook"" is a beautiful and sensitive romance with a love story that is not shallow and makes you think of how fast time goes by.

Allie is the sweet southern girl, her smile and kiss are as sweet as her curly blond hair and red dress. So this is another story that happened in summer.

Later, the story in this book said that there is always such a summer love, such as shooting star, leaving the most brilliant spark in the night sky. Summer is really a season suitable for love.

A boring heartless bloodless pseudo romance,"Yet another movie that was made by people who think just because there are people who kiss on screen it makes the movie emotional or romantic!

MILDLY but it doesn't even come close to elliciting any of the emotional response you might expect from a good movie.The plot goes from one twist to another without any other purpose than to surprise especially naive viewers and the tear jerker ending is a big yawn, even with the talent of poor Rowland and Garner who are completely wasted on the flat dialog and clich√© storyline.The whole thing probably isn't helped by Gosling and McAdams TOTAL lack of chemistry and forced acting but I can't say it would have improved the poor plot any if the young actors had been even remotely close to the talent of their eldest.If you're expecting a real romantic movie like Casablanca or Now Voyager, watch something else.",,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

"A mild, half-hearted love story","This movie is about a love story. It's not a bad movie, it's just a little bit superficial. It's superficial about the characters' development mainly. We really don't know very much about the main characters themself. They're kind of flat, she like painting (she says and it's barely a things), she's rich while he's pour, hard working boy. And they fell in love. That's the stuff.I didn't like it very much because of this, it's just a story we see from outside, and for what we see we've got to trust mainly what is said, we can't rely on what we see because we don't see very much, above all for the flashback parts. It may be a form of storytelling but it made me feel excluded, not part of the story, because I didn't feel to know the characters. And I must be honest, I don't blame just the screenplay, I think is also a choice of the director, and the actors are totally underused.Don't get me wrong, it's a good movie, but is like a story about someone you've heard: it's interesting, you listen to it, but once it's finished your life go on, leaving few traces behind, totally not leaving a mark.I watched and I kind of enjoyed, I didn't like the choices that were made, but I don't think are ""wrong"" choices, it's a good movie after all.

Why I love this film.,"The Notebook is a film about young love and old love, i first watched the beginning of the film in a school lesson and knew i had to watch the rest. I bought the film on DVD and watched it all the way through.This film made me feel happy and warm, mainly because of the time it was set where people could go to the lake and swim and play instead of now where people sit on the Xbox for the weekend. It shows how passionate Noah is about young Allie and what he is willing to do, just to hold her (in the beginning of the film) Ryan Gosling played a well-done part as playing shy and quiet Noah whilst Rachel McAdams was sweet childlike Allie. After i watched the film i cried for hours on end to the point where my eyes were fully swollen, it is a film that i cannot stop talking about and would recommend it to anyone to watch! I think that their story reminds me of how real love is supposed to be. The fact that Noah is rather good looking exaggerates the emotion of sadness.

I don't know where this movie was filmedbut wherever it was, it was very beautiful, the visuals were justbreathtaking. Rachel McAdams and Ryan Gosling were perfect forNoah and Allie, these two will become huge stars. Some will say that the storyline is old and tired, but I definitely haveto disagree.

"The romantic film ""The Notebook"" was by far the most emotionally charged film ever produced.","One of the reasons this is one of the most charged romantic films of all time is the manner in which it was released. First and foremost, I want to say that this film is incredible. The romance started as adolescent love and concluded as a lifelong love. The dialogue, scripting, and plot are all enjoyable. Both the direction and the acting were a real catch. The background music and score were also excellent. Another reason why the movie ""The Notebook"" is the most emotional film ever made is because it strengthens social connections. This is a simple love story about two first lovers who went through all kinds of ups and downs before breaking through. What makes people feel different is that the entire story is interspersed with old age memories. The old man reads this story from his past to his wife, who has lost her memory. They have been married for many years and have sons and granddaughters. He had to accompany her one more time, hoping for a miracle. ""Because she is my baby,"" he explained. She finally remembered him at the end of the story. Despite the fact that it was only for a short time. She sobbed, embraced him, and told him, ""I love you."" If you genuinely love your partner, it will meet you in any situation or condition. Finally, to top it all off, another emotional and heartbreaking condition such as dementia that follows the story line. The film touches many people in various ways. The sad reality of what many people face on a daily basis. Dementia is a tragic and heartbreaking disease. The characteristic of Allie's dementia is never specified in the film, but the majority of the audience is likely to sympathize with Alzheimer's disease. Alzheimer's disease is the most common type of dementia that worsens gradually over time. In The Notebook, Allie has complete memory loss of her past. Many childish critics may say that this film was yet another movie that was made by people who think just because there are people who kiss on screen it makes the movie emotional or romantic, however; I'm here to argue that they're wrong and ignorant. To truly grasp the film's concept, you must sit through the entire two-hour film and recognize that it deals with real-life emotions.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

behind every love there is a story (forget the great),"The reason I saw The Notebook was because I really liked Rachel McAdams in Wedding Crashers. She is a doll, isn't she? Rachel was so good in Wedding Crashers so I wanted to see her in another movie.To tell you the truth I'm not quite sure about this one. The Notebook is definitely not a great movie ¬ñ that's for sure. I haven't read the book but I got the feeling that the director was picking from different passages of the book in order to give us maximum information in a very limited time. I am referring to the second act with all the many short stories ¬ñ the war, house, new boyfriend and girlfriend, and so on and so on. The acting was also not that good. Rachel in a way was OK but Ryan Gosling acted too boyish for this role. There wasn't a good chemistry between the 2 leads. The whole cast with the exception of the old Noah wasn't convincing. Not to mention the ending was so very contrived.However this is a love story and as such some fantasies are allowed. From a bird's view this is a film about the time old question: should one follow the heart or should one follow the head? Which body organ is more reliable when making decisions? Choosing between what's good for the soul or what's good for the body. Passion or reason. Ideal versus money. Tough question I know. But what I know is that the movie also won't give you a convincing answer. I guess there isn't one.There are other good love stories out there that are much better than The notebook. One that comes to mind from the new ones is The Constant Gardener. The Notebook is a romantic melodrama that has its moments I guess. If it so happens that you might even cry, take a look at yourself in the mirror, take your time and think what's wrong with¬Öyou.6 stars out of 10",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

Redemption for Nick Cassavetes,"After a terrible film in JohnQ, the notebook is much much better and actually a great movie. I liked the notebook because first off Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams do fantastic jobs being in love with each other. They often give snug facial expressions that really sell their characters. Their on screen chemistry is great and the development of Noah as the ""regular"" guy is heart felt. He was truly a genuine character. When certain choices are made in this movie I really found myself caring and hoping that certain things would happen. That is what makes a good movie; caring about the characters and their journeys. When the movie stays on track and focused on the two main characters relationship it is great, but when it tends to go off it you feel its need and you want it back faster than you get it. One part I did not like was how Martha was brought into the story and in particular the scene when she leaves. It serves no purpose towards the story and her character has no reason being in the movie let alone this scene. We only want to meet characters that serve a purpose. Other that that I thought the end could have come shorter because you get the big pay off and there is still like 15 minutes left of the movie.

Give yourself in to the emotion and you'll do just fine...,"Regarded by many as one of the greatest chick flicks ever made (many would say the best love story), 'The Notebook' has become very widely-viewed and popular. It has many flaws. The acting of the younger lovers is not too great, and the sappiness can be exhausting at times. On top of all that, the film goes on far too long.BUT... If you can allow yourself to look past all of that, what you will find is a genuinely touching love story. Indeed, you probably have a heart of stone if some scenes don't honestly move you. Trust me, I'm not one for dumb cheesy Hollywood romances, but the older pair of this film is lovely. Gena Rowlands deserved a Best Supporting Actress nomination for her smaller role.The best way to watch 'The Notebook' is by forgetting inhibitions and letting yourself become absorbed in the emotion of the story.

Felt really bad for her husband but give him props for still loving and wanting to be with her.I was very surprised seeing Rachel McAdams playing Allie after seeing her in previous teen movies ""Hot Chick"" and ""Mean girls"", but her acting in this movie was pretty phenomenal. And Ryan Gosling...very good looking actor who played his character well.I think, though, that they caught Allie's and Noah's stories short towards the ending. I would have loved to watched more about their future. Ending was a little bit weird for me but made sense.Recommended: People who enjoy love stories.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Heartbreaking.,"Honestly one of the saddest movies I've seen. I am a softie, but even then it's unbelievably sad.The story is told perfectly.

Dreams Of Summer Long Ago,"Duke (James Garner) and Allie (Gena Rowlands) live in a home for patients with special needs. She suffers with advanced dementia and does not want to leave her room. When he begins reading to her, it distracts her from her situation, and she becomes engaged in the story.The story is about the beginnings of a tempestuous relationship between a young lumberyard worker (Ryan Gosling as Noah) and a teenager (Rachel McAdams as Allie) who come from different sides of the tracks. It is 1940 and her wealthy family is spending the summer in Charleston. They talk about her life-long plans to attend college at one of the Seven Sisters. But when Noah enters her life, they wonder if it is merely a summer romance or a real threat to their aspirations.The film starts a little slowly, but director Nick Cassavetes competently guides this romantic drama as it gains momentum. His mother, Gena, and James Garner provide a tender but tough representation of the heartbreak of dementia. Gosling and McAdams are believable as a tragic couple whose attraction seems fated by the stars, but doomed to fail. The photography is beautiful, as are the South Carolina locations.The film's big surprise is not so surprising, but the ending still jerks the tears.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

Tearjerker chick flick,"I didn't like the book for this movie, and thus stayed away for a while, but on the recommendation of a friend, I went ahead and saw this.  It is definitely a chick flick, but I found it to be well acted and a compelling story.  I thought the actor who played Lon, however, looked more like James Garner than Ryan Gosling did...and I guess it was a little unbelievable that the girl would pick him, looking as bedraggled as he did, over the good look rich guy...but maybe that's just me :)  When the older James Garner was looking at the photo albums, I almost laughed because it was quite a transformation...Gosling looks nothing like Garner.

One of the best choices for romance movies lovers,"""The Notebook."" This romantic drama, based on Nicholas Sparks' novel, tells the story of Noah and Allie, two young lovers from different social backgrounds who are separated by circumstances. The movie beautifully captures the power of love and the enduring connection between Noah and Allie.

I'd rather put out a cigarette in my eye than to watch this crap again,"Dear IMDb readers,Please do not watch this movie, especially if you are a single female. The film will only continue to enhance the completely ridiculous Disney version of life; being that we will always end up with 'the one', and that we're 'meant to be' with 1 person and no other. If you buy into that baloney, then by all means, please buy this film, watch it, believe in love that is described in the movie, and continue to be delusional about life.Though James Garner and Gena Rowlands put on formidable performances (worthy of Oscars for best supporting roles), the story and script was nothing short of complete pit bottom garbage. Clich√©s are the pillars of the movie, while the acting by Gosling and McAdams made me sick. Cheesy lines and totally unrealistic portrayals of love and life complement the disturbingly reality that women in Western cultures are conditioned to believe in love as portrayed in ""The Notebook.""

A True Love Story From Beginning To End,"You don't find many movies like The Notebook. Sure, there are many loves stories, too many, actually. They all follow the same formula and you know the ending from the time the lights go down. The Notebook is also a love story; it's a formulaic movie that you already know the end of. What makes it different is that it's the story of one couples relationship from start to finish. 	Allie (Rachel McAdams) and Noah (Ryan Gosling) meet at a carnival the summer that Allie is seventeen. She's high society spending the summer in Seabrook. He doesn't have a dime to his name. It's the classic tale of love, the rich girl and the boy her parents don't approve of. Despite, they fall in love. Fast-forward twenty years, Allie's about to marry to a man of money. But that wouldn't be fitting in this story of true love, would it?The movie is based off the novel by Nicholas Sparks (A Walk To Remember, Message In A Bottle). Like his previous two book-into-movie adaptations, the focus is on the story and not the characters. These stories do not specialize in developing well-rounded characters. To enjoy The Notebook, you have to suspend reality in this aspect. Noah appears to the audience as the perfect boy, who's just too nice, too sweet. His character is always staring at Allie with sad, puppy dog eyes, even after twenty-five years. But, if you accept that this is the character, Ryan Gosling's performance is good. It's strong and believable. Rachel McAdams who's previous film this year was Mean Girls, takes a complete turn form that and gives the best performance of the movie. This may be because her character is the written better than anyone else's. 	The true achievement of The Notebook is in the portrayal of first love, the summer romance. McAdams and Gosling have a great chemistry that is not just a physical attraction but, even in their quarrels, they still radiate a deep friendship that helps underline the point of The Notebook. Fortunately, the portion of the movie with McAdams and Gosling is more than the part with the older versions of themselves (James Garner and Joan Allen). Garner is reading from the notebook to Allen. She is stricken with Alzheimers and he's convinced that if he reads the story to her enough, his Allie will remember. It's touching and sweet but not as accurately done as the former. From mistakes in the medical aspects of it, to the leap of faith the last scene makes, it comes up more scattered than the rest. 	It's not an amazing movie but from the material it's based on, it could have been much worse. The excellent performances by the whole cast and the heart that is shown make it a decent film. It's not one that will stand the test of time as an amazing love story but it's worth seeing. Though it's a tearjerker, it's also hopeful in the best way.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
The Notebook is the best movie I've seen in years.,"First of all, I think anyone who disliked the movie is absolutely heartless and crazy. The Notebook contained an incredible story of two people who truly love each other. I know many people whom aren't even girls that love this movie. So what if it's all mushy.. I loved it. Lately, it's much of what I think about, and I've been encouraging many of my friends to see it. Those who have watched it, cannot get over it's profound beauty. You do not have to be a love-sick 'teeny-bopper' to enjoy this movie. My boyfriend bought it for me as a Valentine's Day gift, & even he liked it. So- you do not 'have to have a vagina' to like it. If I had the time to watch it every single day, I would. It has become my all-time favorite movie.. & I am astounded by the performance. Rachel McAdams & Ryan Gosling are truly good actors. They deserve praise for this movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
One of the better chick flicks.,"The Notebook tells the same old girly movie story. A poor boy falls in love with a rich girl, who doesn't really like him at first, but they develop a relationship and become inseparable. When she has to go off to school and he goes off to war, they lose touch, and she ends up engaged to another man. After reading about her first love in the newspaper, she goes to see him, wondering how he's doing. They discover that there's still something there, and they fall in love all over again. This is just another chick flick, but it is one of the better ones.The problem I have with chick flicks is that they're always so depressing. One of the main characters is always dying, or ill in some way. Something always ends up going wrong in the end, and it's done purposely to make teenage girls cry. This movie is different. There's no terminally ill characters, and the main characters end up happy. However, this movie does have the same old formula of rich girl/poor boy. That's a story I'm starting to get really tired of.The acting is pretty good. I had no complaints about how cheesy the acting was, which is also new for me. As a guy, I only watched this movie because Rachel McAdams is hot, but she did do a really good job.Overall, it's still got its corny moments, but it's the best chick flick there is.6.5/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

The performances by Rachel McAdams and Ryan Gosling are star-making. Gena Rowlands and James Garner...not as terrific, but hey, let's cut them some slack. The photography was stunning, especially the water scenes. The production and editing are a little erratic and choppy (WW2 scenes in particular), but again it can be overlooked.

"The ""Ben-Hur"" of 21st century tear-jerkers","""The Notebook"" is a story everyone in the world has heard a million times before; young Romeo-and-Juliet summer love which is tossed and turned continuously by opposing outside forces. We've read it a hundred times before we start the first chapter, know the conclusion before we see the end of the film, and can relate it to so many moments from the past relationships of our lives.But what makes this film different from others is one main thing; beauty.Never before have I been moved this emotionally by a romance. From the moment is starts, you get sucked right in. You're totally involved in in these characters and unlike many romantic films I've watched, you actually care about what happens. The love between Allie and Noah is so passionate and so vivid yet real and universal for any age. Any viewer will stay connected with the story for the film's length and will be moved long after the credits stop rolling.No matter how many times you've seen movies with the exact same plot, I promise you you'll appreciate every second of ""The Notebook"".

A Truly Moving Film even though it's a little predictable,"I was really prepared to not like this picture. I had seen the trailer and read about it and it just seemed so.....predictable.

It was also interesting to me because it's one of the few movies in a long time that my mom and could watch together, and I guess that's a good thing. She liked it more than I did and I think it made her think a lot about some things in her own life. I thought Rachel McAdams was really amazing -- there is something about her looks, the way her skin is so translucent, that you feel like you can really feel everything she feels and understand her character better than with other actors. Ryan Gosling was also good -- hot without trying to hard to be a ""hottie"". And James Garner -- what a cool old guy. My mom made me watch him in his ""Maverick"" days and I'm glad I did.

outdated but still a great romance,"I have so much things to say about this movie, i went into it thinking i'll either hate it or think it's just okay but i couldn't have been wrong even if i tried to because i loved it instead, the reason why i thought i'll hate it is because i thought Noah was just going to be the worst guy ever and to be fair, he is in fact awful, mostly and especially at the very start, if this movie came out today he'd be cancelled for the crap he was doing and Allie wasn't that great either but the chemistry ( minus the fighting ) between them was so good that i didn't care too much, i feel like romances nowadays don't have that kind of chemistry but i won't go into that. And boy that ending.... THAT ENDING, i won't spoil it but it's just so sad, my mouth was left open and my eyes were left watery, it was just amazing, although i understand people who hate this movie since any sane woman would run away from a guy if he did the stuff that Noah was doing in this movie but i still loved it despite all that, i think you really have to remember that this movie is based on a book from 1996, plus it was written by a man so yeah... keep that in mind.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

Not really a guy's kinda film, The Yawnbook more like it. Dong la!However, in saying that. I have never managed to be more drawn into the middle of the movie. Katherine Hepburn who plays Audry, an autistic teenager portrays a dis-normal childhood into a slightly parodic type to which anyone can relate to. Michael Keaton who plays the childs father is heroic in the sense that he can hold a job as a lawyer while still managing to cure Audry's illness. The mother who is played by Kathlene Turner is anything but funny, a serious and mischievous woman who gains satisfaction, when she wins the lottery at a local RSL and learns that there can be happiness from money if one wishes for it hard enough. This romantic yet dramatic real life story can only be described as confusing yet relatable in it's self confusion of today's world and economy.The scenes are beautifully done in exotic Africa and Hungary, mostly from a small farm in Brazil, containing beautiful images of young and old and doctors who try to cure glandular fever.I would rate this movie to be one of the years top films, well done Hiroshi Wu for directing this film and to all the support from leading charities who contributed to this film from Hong Kong.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

You will cry I assure you!,"To say the least ""The Notebook '' is THE best romantic film, it's hard not to give in.It is really worth watching. I had many opportunities to see this film, but I didn't really take the plunge, when I finally did, I didn't regret it at all. After watching it twice, I wouldn't hesitate to watch it a third time. The Notebook stands out from other films of this genre, thanks in particular to its rich and moving dialogue and delicate direction. The acting in the film is of course remarkable. We are absorbed into the great story line.We are plunged into the 30s/40s following the story of a summer love between Allie and Noah which becomes more and more serious. This love story is not monotonous, there are many twists indeed the two main characters are not from the same social background. That love is not impossible and that when one is in love there is no obstacle. This love will never leave them it seems like this love follows them. It's perfectly captured on screen through the chemistry between Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams, who seem to be fully in love.Of course, for some, it will be too much, but for romantics like us, such a beautiful melodrama.The last twenty minutes were absolutely tearing at your heart strings and gave me a real slap in the face, they reminded us that love is the most powerful thing against age...

A film that clearly tugs at heart-strings.,"This movie, in my opinion, is one of the best movies ever produced. It is a movie of such rare quality that it even made me cry, especially when it came to the end, showing the loyalty and essence of true love that we should all pursue in our respective lives. And that message was brought out very clearly, even more so by the chemistry between Rachel McAdams and Ryan Gostling. The casting of such fresh, yet talented faces only served to cleverly tug upon the heart-strings of audiences. However, i believe that more could be done in the film. Perhaps a more detailed depiction of the dilemma affecting Allie, in the fields choosing either an easy pursuit of an affection-filled marriage, or rather, going with her heart in search of a greater love that lies with Noah. Still, the clever linkages back to the heart-rending love that Noah had for Allie when old is nothing short of being exemplary. The climax of the film would have to be the part when Allie finally regains her memory, albeit only for a few minutes. The dedication that a husband should have towards his spouse, and vice-versa, is best demonstrated in this film. Definitely not a chick-flick, but a masterpiece.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

It had a lot of heart, more heart than most romantic films in the 21st century do. Than the story went sour, the ending was contrived and almost felt laughable. The ending spoiled the film for me.

An Overhyped Romance That Doesn't Live Up to the Hype,"The Notebook has undoubtedly become a beloved classic in the romance genre, but for all its fame, it feels somewhat overhyped. The chemistry between the leads is undeniable, and the performances are solid, but the story often relies too heavily on predictable tropes that feel more contrived than heartfelt. While the emotional beats land for some, others may find the plot overly melodramatic and at times even frustrating. The iconic moments, like the rain-soaked kiss, are memorable, but the overall narrative doesn't always resonate as deeply as its cultural impact suggests. For those looking for a deeply moving romance, it might be worth tempering expectations - The Notebook is charming, but not as groundbreaking as it's often made out to be.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
"Exploitive, vapid, and absurd - tantamount to pornography","Like many guys, I was roped into watching this film by my girlfriend, and while I was expecting a chick flick that I would not enjoy but that would likely get me laid, nothing could have prepared me for the tidal wave of bullshit I was in for. ""The Notebook"" is one of the most unimaginitive, exploitive films I have ever seen, and Nicholas Sparks should be curbstomped for every hour he spent churning out this garbage.Let's start with the positives. Cinematography was inoffensive and fellas, if you watch this with your special lady, you're almost sure to get laid.And now on to the negatives. ""The Notebook,"" while masquerading as a love story, in fact, has no story at all. The plot is barely existent, the characters are one-dimensional at best and impossible to like beyond a superficial level, and the storyline is shallower than a children's inflatable pool, existing solely to pimp Sparks's Easy-Bake, feel-good concept of romance. While most ""chick-flicks"" do their best to create likable characters, humorous situations, and some sort of conflict, ""The Notebook"" is content to instead show only a slideshow reel of Kodak moments, an abstract representation of our fast-food, home shopping network society's ideal of romance.""The Notebook"" is exploitive on every single level. In some ways, the film is worse than pornography, the way it masks its sleazy, purely commercial motivation under the guise of presenting a ""love"" story. In pornography, plot exists solely as a device to get from point A (the film's exposition), to point B (the sex) as quickly as possible. ""The Notebook"" uses a similar formula, but instead of graphic sex and nudity, this film's golden calf is a perfect, simplistic romance that faces conflict and challenge on the most superficial level possible. There's a massive section of the movie that contains little aside from the couple kissing each other in a variety of settings, all leading up to their first time sleeping together, which is, of course, perfect, just like everything else in this perfect, vacuous storyline.I could go on and on, but I'm only allowed 1,000 words in this particular review. ""The Notebook"" is a shallow, simplistic, and wholly idiotic view of romance that seems to exist solely to make girls horny, a goal which it achieves remarkably. That being said, the film has no value on any real artistic level, be it storytelling, character development, or even simply on the level of pure entertainment. The entire film plays out like a slideshow you might play at your wedding - highlighting all the good times and ignoring anything that might make it remotely interesting. Everyone involved in the making of this film should feel dirty, especially the film-maker himself, who almost completely destroys the pre-eminence of the Cassavettes name in this one effort.",1.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
"The Notebook is a story told with dedication and affection, with scenes of great charm, that deserves to be seen with the soul, and the heart, wide open","An old-fashioned love story. This is how The Notebook can be described, an assumed novel without the slightest shame of being so. Based on a best seller by Nicholas Sparks, (The Notebook, 2004) is not afraid to opt for the most trivial water-with-sugar. On the contrary. Behind an apparently simple love story, there is the metalinguistic defense of a genre that has fallen into disuse in the current days of cynicism. Even the time portrayed by director Nick Cassavetes, the 1940s of war and the American dream, refers to the heyday of melodrama. Noah and Allie met as teenagers. What was meant to be just a passing summer adventure ends up having effects and consequences of a lifetime. This does not come as a big surprise, as the story is told from the beginning by the couple in old age, when they find themselves in a geriatric home, both with health problems - he with a heart, she with Alzheimer's. The interest of the script will be to gradually unravel the difficulties that both faced to be together, such as the fierce opposition of the girl's mother (a small but remarkable participation by Joan Allen) or the humble origin of the boy.The Notebook bears similarities to two equally touching films released at about the same time: the Argentinian Son of The Bride (2001), by Juan Jose Campanella, and the English Iris (2001), by Richard Eyre. Like the first, it shows in a simple and direct way how strong a person's love for another can be, without this speech becoming corny or melancholy. While in relation to the second there is the ever-present discussion about the finitude of the human being, but without ceasing to oppose the fragility of the physical with the sovereignty of the emotional. The harmony between the lovers is so strong that not even the greatest adversity - death - will be able to separate them.There is no problem in revealing the truth of the characters here - a rather obvious situation, which the script tries to keep in ineffective suspense. What matters, yes, is understanding that Noah's struggle to preserve the past is less about Allie and much more about the genre itself swallowed by History. Knowing that the film is meant to simply pay homage to melodrama makes it all the more enjoyable. The discomfort of the shallow plot gives way to nostalgia for the Ferris wheel, making out at the movies, boat trips and unconditional love. This is enough to effectively induce the audience to cry. But there is the other side. And if the film isn't afraid to dare, let it accept criticism of its intention. The feeling of ""how good it was back then..."" goes hand in hand with fetish and parody. Without reinventing old formulas, without introducing something new, there is no way to make them work authentically.The cast gathered good revelations with proven talents and without them nothing would work so well. The couple of lovers is lived in their youth by the then newcomers Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams. Despite the legend that the two can't stand each other on the set, the chemistry between the two on the scene is notorious and one of the best successes of the production. Gosling has one of his first romantic roles here, a bias that he would insist on in the also touching Valentine Forever (2010) and The Place Where It All Ends (2012), for example. McAdams, on the other hand, abandoned his supporting role here for the first time - as in the entertaining Mean Girls (2004) - to take on the role of protagonist in similar productions, although not as efficient, as I Will Love You Forever (2009) and Forever (2012). In the present time, the two are replaced by veterans James Garner and Rowlands, who is responsible for some of the most moving moments in the entire plot. The participation of James Garner (from the series 8 Simple Rules and Maverick) and Gena Rowlands (from Stealing Lives) greatly enrich the ending of the film, touching and that will bring many lovers within the cinema to tears. Although exciting, this ending is a little too long, and should have ended a little earlier (I won't reveal the final moments to those who haven't watched the film) without the appeal of the two together parting from the world and less tiring.Another great positive factor for the acceptance of this climate created is the environment, without a doubt. Expect beautifully photographed scenery, such as a beautiful kissing scene in the rain, an unforgettable walk among trees and ducks, and much more. Even the opening was masterfully crafted, almost entirely against the sun, making good use of the silhouettes, together with the paradisiacal scenery that surrounds the main characters. Combined with smooth music by Aaron Zigman that controls your emotion, we could consider the film tasteless, pretentious or otherwise manipulative. Well, that last adjective undoubtedly fits, but in a film that never denies that intention and that simply achieves its goal of moving, it turns out not to be a bad word.Yes, there are bad moments throughout the production. Perhaps the most annoying thing is the clich√© of using maternal disapproval as an element that triggers part of the action and which is explained in the end, in order to try to redeem the character. However, even these ""flaws"" are important for the final result. A totally unnecessary point is the passage through the war. It simply doesn't add anything to the plot, it's simply about having a war in the middle of the story, it serves more to set the time when everything happened. On the poster, it says that this war separated the two characters, but when we watch the movie, we see that there is none of that. If it were shown on screen or simply quoted, it wouldn't change anything in terms of the narrative. The scene is short and unnecessary. It's okay that Noah loses an important friend there, but this loss has absolutely no influence on what happens afterwards.But evaluating cinema in an overly technical and critical way can end up blinding us to the small details that really matter when we watch a movie. The way in which the message is conveyed is a key part to cause identification in the public, but sometimes, all it takes is a little willpower and paying attention directly to the message and in this case, it is difficult to resist and focus only on the defects as a way of belittling the film. From the intro, with a slow melody played on the piano, accompanying Gena Rowlands watching birds flying over a lake, to the final scene, the production is full of beautiful moments. Some may fall for the excess of fantasy and romanticism, as in the scene where Noah (Ryan Gosling) climbs the Ferris wheel in a park to get a date with Allie (Rachel McAdams).The clich√©s return during the conquest period between the couple. Were it not for the naturalness with which Gosling and McAdams interpret their characters, it could be a shameful part of the story and would end up destroying the entire charm of the film. The novel written by Nicholas Sparks offers the public. After all, why does this feeling hit us with so much impact? Noah and Allie meet in a park and they both notice each other enough to have a date (okay, I'm not ignoring Noah's exhibitionist attitude to get his future wife's attention, I just focused on the fact that she was interested too) and soon they go out together, exchanging passionate looks and simple moments, which are so important to create the foundation of a relationship. The narration offers us an example of soulmates, of two people who were born for each other. Regardless of all the fights and arguments, the important thing is that their relationship was strong enough to be real and cultivated for life. That is, Sparks idealizes romanticism and recreates the perfect couple, something he usually repeats (often without success) in all his books and adapted screenplays.And what about the impact of the sequence in which the truth about patient ""Duke"" (Garner) is revealed? Until then, he was just an old man telling a story to another patient. Of course, a more attentive viewer might assume he was narrating the novel itself, but when Noah's entire family arrives, it's an exercise against gravity to try to hold back the first few tears. While all of his children are resigned to their mother's degenerative disease (which is not explained how/when it started, in a wise choice that avoids losing the focus of the plot) and think it is crazy that the father lives in that hospital and that he should return home, Noah simply says: ""We are talking about my love, I will not abandon her. This is my home now; your mother is my home.""Even that statement doesn't prepare the viewer for the two scenes in which Allie briefly regains her memory. In the first, she discovers that the story she had been hearing was her own life and dances with her husband until she loses her memory again and has a nervous breakdown. No person should feel the pain of being powerless in a situation like this, where you lose the great love of your life, even if she is still there, by your side. The second scene takes place at the end of the film and is one of the most perfect and beautiful moments in the film. And mysterious, why not? After all, Allie is awakened in the middle of the night and immediately remembers Noah. The two talks about the possibility of their love causing a miracle, which would be the death of the two together and conclude that the love of the two can do everything they want.Beautiful, sensitive and irresistible, ""The Notebook"" is one of those films capable of provoking sighs and hiccups among the most emotional, and even the most brutal will have to make an effort to contain an eventual tear. A story told with dedication and affection, with scenes of great charm and an equally engaging soundtrack. A work that deserves to be seen with the soul, and the heart, wide open.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
so sweet! very well done.,"A nick cassavetes film, with gena rowlands (mom!). Peter falk must have been busy, or he would be in here too. Duke (garner) is reading to miss allie(rowlands), who seems to have some amount of dementia. And as they read, we flash back to when noah (gosling) falls for allie (mcadams). They already have one strike against them, since they are clearly from different parts of town.. allie is high society sweater girl, while noah is mister blue collar, working lad. Life takes them in and out of each other's lives a couple times. But will they ever get together and stay together? Very sweet story. Totally predictable, but still really good.

Here I am with a soaking handkerchief,"""The Notebook"" (2004) has something absolutely amazing - the best on-screen chemistry between two young lovers who are crazy about each other, whose love is so real, so overwhelming, so tender and passionate that you actually forget that they are acting. Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams are sensational. Since I saw Ryan in his controversial ""The Believer"" (2001), I always wait for his next film. I believe that he's got a great future. McAdams was radiant- just to think that the first movie I saw her in was Rob Schneider's ""Hot Chick"" (yes, I rented it). Her work in ""The Notebook"" made me think that for many young (and not so young) artists the biggest problem is not the lack of talent but the chance to find the right material and the right director who can make the best of their abilities.I like the movie. I believe it deserves its tears. It really made me think of Woody Allen's words, ""If you want to make God laugh, tell him about your plans"". Even if the plans are as simple as to live happily ever after.8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Its cute,"""The Notebook"" is a heartfelt and emotional love story that spans decades. Adapted from Nicholas Sparks' novel, the film tells the tale of Noah and Allie, two young lovers from different social backgrounds who are separated by circumstances but never forget each other.The narrative, framed by an elderly man recounting their story to a fellow nursing home resident, adds an extra layer of sentimentality. Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams deliver convincing performances that capture the intensity of their characters' feelings.The movie navigates themes of enduring love, sacrifice, and the passage of time, making it a tearjerker that resonates with audiences seeking an emotionally charged romance.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
One that can be watched over and over...,"Watched this movie again tonight for the 'Xth' time. Its becoming a timeless classic.One brilliant thing about this movie is they push the ""love"" dialogue and theatrics to the farthest edge without crossing the line into soppy or cheese. Eg. Rowing in a row boat surrounded by hundreds of white geese -- it works! This is a testament to the writing and acting. The onscreen chemisty between the two leads is so engaging that the audience is cheering for the ultimate ending. Which is also why we tolerate the predictability of the storyline.Most importantly, the story beautifully portrays the foundations of real love between two people. It is selfless. It is timeless. It laughs. It cries. It is sad. It is joyous. It stems from a deeper soul connection that transcends the superficial, and the two people in it feel like thats all they have ever known between each other.Add to all of this, the cinematography, setting and music which make this one special film.Gosling is absolutely fabulous as is McAdams.For those that haven't seen it, youre in for a treat.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Cheesy But Saved By Its Lead Performances,"The Notebook is a well known film. If you say ""romance film"", the first movie that pops into peoples minds is generally The Notebook. I would say they do because of two main reasons. The first reason being that it's written by Nicolas Sparks, the writer of tons of cheesy romance books, making it have some really cheesy elements to it, but I also believe that it's chemistry between its leads helps save this from falling flat. (Which is ironic because apparently Gosling hated McAdams when they were shooting and they didn't get along)As I said, the film is quite cheesy. It uses many clich√©s that romance movies use, the biggest probably being the ""rich girl loves poor boy whom her parents disapprove of"" clich√©. There's also a lot of unrealistically cheesy stuff with the whole Alzheimer's's thing, making it just seem ridiculous. You can tell a lot of things are written to be overly romantic or tug on your heart strings without much regard as to what makes sense. That's not to say there aren't good romantic things here. Sometimes love and romance can be cheesy in real life, that's just the way it is, so you kind of have to accept things to a certain degree. Moments such as the kiss in the rain or love scene really work, but I think that's all because of the chemistry between Gosling and McAdams.This really is a film saved by its performances. Moments that would seem awkward or cheesy if done with other actors seem more believable between Gosling and McAdams, totally boosting the quality of this film. Gosling comes across as a really love struck guy who you feel for, and McAdams pulls off that beautiful and fun but slightly naive and unsure girl role perfectly. I honestly think this movie would be another stupid film to appeal to unrealistic female fantasies if it wasn't for these performances.Overall, I think this film is well known in the romance genre for a reason. It's got cheesy moments but stuff that works. I do believe, however, that it's way more easily enjoyed by people who are currently in love or in a relationship or whatever, because if you haven't experienced it, you just won't feel the feelings that Gosling and McAdams wonderfully express in their best moments. If you're single and lonely... you will hate this film big time.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

The Notebook,"A gently touching look at an elderly couple who must deal with present day mental illness told through a retrospective of their not uneventful lives. Rachel McAdams is ""Allie"", a young girl from a wealthy family who falls for ""Noah"" (Ryan Gosling) but her mother wants much better for her, so takes her away to their city home and keeps all of his (365) letters. He joins the Army and fights in WWII and, after time, she meets the handsome, wealthy James Marsden (""Lon"") but before she marries, she returns to their old stomping ground and... To be fair, the young love/boy from the wrong side of the tracks story elements of the plot are a bit old hat. It's the delicate mechanics of the film that work best - James Garner (""Duke"") is reading a story to dementia suffered ""Allie"" (Gena Rowlands) about the shenanigans of a young couple in the 1940s without us necessarily realising how poignant and apposite his story is. Gradually we become more invested in their lives and as the story starts to knit together, we start to appreciate just how hard it can be for a couple where one has this most cruel of illnesses.

"a very beautiful, touching love story","It's one of most romantic movie ever to be seen. I cannot describe how wonderful this movie was. From the very beginning you are drawn into the movie. At first I thought the movie a little silly, but the longer the movie going on the more i was going to love it. Although the story of the book is at some point very different from the actual movie. But for me that's no problem. I've watched quite a lot of movies without reading the books where they're based upon.The story as you know is about Noah and Allie. When they meet each other, they're both around 17 years of age, it's almost love at first sight. After a summer of romantic love they have to split, because he is poor and she is rich. So Allie's parents believe it's a love that will never last. But fate decides otherwise. They'll meet each other again.Just before Allie's wedding with another rich man. And their love returns and in the end they both believe this love is meant to last forever.This story is told by the old Noah. He reads the story to a woman with Alzheimer disease. (Of course it turns out to be his wife)That part is beautifully played by James Garner and Gena Rowlands.This is one those movies couples will not easily forget. It's about your first love and never able to forget it. The performances of the leads are incredible. Especially the young pair, played by Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams, are absolutely stunning. I've rarely seen so much chemistry between lead characters. The movie itself is beautifully shot, the music is wonderful. I read that many people cried throughout the movie, but i didn't(I never did by the way.) Crying no, deeply touched and tears not to far away yes.Of course the movie has some minor weaknesses.(All movies have, even the Lord of the Rings3,considered the best movie of all time) For one,the end is taking too long and the best part, the young couple, is missing in the last 15/20 minutes of the film. The other is the sometimes ridiculous lines the actors have to say. But that is hardly avoidable. Rate:9.5/10P.S.

I also see when one of the two gets sick and lingers on while the other comes and visits them everyday rain or snow..Much talk about this movie is about the younger actors but the relationship that has lasted ( seen thru the photos in the notebook ) is what really made the movie for me. Even when he was losing the true love of his life he gave up everything else including his house and kids to spend as much time as he could with her! If anyone is reading this stop and think when was the last time you spoke or visited with your mother-father-grandparents etc. Life is short and isn't it what we experience everyday in his or her life what really matters?

"Great book, ""so-so"" film","As a fan of Nicholas Sparks's romantic novels and being ""The Notebook"" one of my favorites, I had to see this movie. Now here comes the time to share my feelings about it. In my opinion, this is a reasonable, emotional and romantic movie, but the book is slightly superior. Without getting into the differences between the book and the movie, at least I've got to tell that I personally find the book deeper, more sentimental, more intense, more beautiful, more emotional and certainly more romantic.The book is one of the deepest and most beautiful love stories of all time and touched me like few romances did. Apart ""The Notebook"", only ""Message in a Bottle"" had the same impact on me - another one of the best books by Nicholas Sparks.Back to the movie ""The Notebook"", it isn't bad but it's inevitable to compare it with the book. Anyone who saw the movie and is familiar with the book, knows that the book is more complete (the same happens with ""Message in a Bottle""). As a movie, ""The Notebook"" seems somehow like a forced adaptation in many parts.About the actors, both Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams are good in the roles of Noah Calhoun and Allie Hamilton, but I'm not sure if they are the best choice for these roles. I don't know who would I cast for Noah, but for Allie I'm sure that Jennifer Love Hewitt or Sarah Michelle Gellar would make a perfect Allie (any of them).In my opinion, the best thing about this movie is probably its beautiful landscapes and backgrounds, especially that enormous lake/swamp where Noah and Allie are crossing by boat and the lake scene with ducks flying at the beginning (by the sunrise or sunset time).",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

Sentimental yet entertaining,"I love this film... Which is a big statement coming from someone who doesn't normally enjoy romantic/sentimental movies! The characters are instantly likable, the storyline moves at a good pace and there's a good mix of humour and intrigue as well as the obvious tear-jerking moments.The only possible criticism is that the plot is very predictable, so you can guess how it's going to end more or less straight away... but this doesn't detract from the enjoyment of the film, as it's such a beautiful story you still want to know how the characters' lives play out.I would definitely recommend that people watch this movie at least once, but don't forget the waterproof mascara as I watched it with 4 other girls and we were all in floods of tears by the end! And if you're not generally into this kind of film, don't let the idea of love, romance and tears put you off, this film is definitely worth a watch!",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Classic Love Story!,"So beautifully made. The movie captures me beautifully from beginning to end. Although there was a bit of slow screenplay, this slow screenplay is a must subject to the romantic story. Everything unfolds beautifully, realizing how love can last a lifetime.The best scene of the whole movie was the ducks wandering in the middle of the river. And then, cute conversation between the two of them on the boat.Ryan Gosling has given the best performance. Some of the scenes were extremely heart-touching!

Yes i almost cry at the end. It changed me when we got out the movie with my girlfriend. This movie really touches you deep inside. Look at the majority of the comments, almost everyone cried. And why crying, if no one got killed? we cried, because of joy, sadness and fear. This movie shows you that, you could be immortal and live forever with the person you love.

"""Iris"" Redux","One might categorize ""The Notebook"" as the ultimate ""chick flick"" since there is little in the story to appeal to male viewers.  Not much takes place that has not happened in dozens of other films.  A young man and a young woman meet, they fall in love, they face obstacles, they part, they... Well, if you have been to the movies sometime in the past 100 years, you can fill in the rest.  However, the movie does have a framing device that bears a striking resemblance to the recent bio film about writer Iris Murdoch, ""Iris.""  In the earlier film, however, the story balance was tilted towards the older characters, while in ""The Notebook,"" the younger players hold center stage.  The downbeat nature of ""Iris"" was bearable because of the towering performances of Judi Dench and Jim Broadbent.  Unfortunately, ""The Notebook"" is less distinguished.  While the older pair, Gena Rowlands and James Garner, are seasoned pros and do an able job, particularly Garner, the cast in the earlier scenes are just O.K., although paddling through a Disneyesque lake filled with thousands of white geese and keeping a straight face must require a great deal of acting discipline.  At times the entire film is as cloying as that treacly rippling-water scene despite desperate attempts to be moving and touching.  While ""Iris"" rose above its depressing subject matter with unforgettable performances that could break the heart of the most hardened stoic, ""The Notebook"" fails to evoke a single tear and turns a similar story into a sappy sentimental ""date film.""",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
A Romance that is going to stay,"This well written (first book then movie) romance, has to be one of the most famous romances of the past 20 years. And for a reason. Even though it really has too much cliches, it somehow wins you. The plot is not that original and of course there are not many shocking events but the way that it builds the storyline till the end is phenomenal. The scenery of the 40s is lovely and so are the lakes, the cars, the houses and literally everything else from that age. Also the acting is perfect, especially the chemistry between both 2 couples (the teen and the elderly couple). Such a great chemistry.So, its a nice movie to watch either with company and friends, or alone, and a great movie if you love a good-classic romance.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
A film with the potential to be a real heartbreaker let down by sentiment and melodrama,"Channel 4 here in the UK heavily promoted UK ""The Notebook"" over the weekend, and I was attracted by the trailer into watching it last night. The cinematography was excellent, especially the scenes of the geese on the river. The movie wonderfully captured a sense of place: I smiled at the scenes of the riverbanks and Spanish moss, and I could feel the warmth of the summer nights. I've never spent much time in South Carolina, but I spent several years living in North Central Florida, and the film does justice to the beauty of the Southern wilderness.However, the script lets down the love story. ""The Notebook"" has the potential to be a shattering film about the power of love. The flashbacks to Ally and Noah's youth, aside from the cinematography, are nothing special. They tell a story told many times before in other films and books: rich girl meets poor boy, boy loses girl, boy meets girl again, girl must choose on the eve of her wedding whether to marry for security and love or just love. It's the framing story that delivers a punch: what happens when a couple who have overcome great obstacles to be together face a terrible obstacle that can not be defeated, that destroys them not just by attacking their bodies, as old age does, but by obliterating one partner's memory and mind? The film reveals how Duke dedicates himself to his wife, living in the same residential home, reading to her from the notebook she compiled, sparking whatever residential memories remain of their life together. The contemporary scenes show the pain of their children, who Ally greets as strangers, and the torture of Duke as he continually tries to help his wife emerge from her perpetual cloud of forgetting, even for a few moments.If the film ended with Duke's witnessing Ally's confusion and terror as she struggles against him, believing him once again to be a stranger, it would be heartbreaking. Unfortunately ""The Notebook"" is diminished by melodrama and sentimentality. I'm not a medical expert but I have seen documentaries about Alzheimer's and I've read several books by Oliver Sacks: they state, as the doctor in ""the Notebook"" does, that once brain cells die, once memory begins to deteriorate, there's not much hope of it ever returning. Duke battles against the disease, as did Ally herself when she wrote the stories of their lives that he reads to her. I cried when he read his beloved Whitman to her: ""Nothing is ever really lost, or can be lost"". Whitman's lines are a tribute to Ally and Duke's lonely struggle:No birth, identity, form--no object of the world. Nor life, nor force, nor any visible thing; Appearance must not foil, nor shifted sphere confuse thy brain¬Ö The body, sluggish, aged, cold--the embers left from earlier fires, The light in the eye grown dim, shall duly flame againBut the film's portrayal of dementia is more like the Keeper in Babylon 5: a force that suppresses a person's mind, that can be subdued for a few moments so that the personality can emerge intact and free for a precious short time. Indeed Ally asks how much time they have and Duke replies that the last time it was for 5 minutes.""The notebook"" would be much more powerful if it showed a flicker of recognition on Ally's face, a scene that shows she understands what Duke means to her: not an inner teenager peeping out of a aged body to yell yoo hoo before curfew kicks back in. It would also be much powerful if it resisted the maudlin ending. I could believe that Ally would remember Duke reading to her, that she would miss him, that even she was again her old self for a few moments. But their dying hand in hand and the CGI geese were slush.There's a heartbreaking story within ""The Notebook"" but the laspses into sentiment and melodrama make it another four handkerchief weepie, perfect for a Sunday afternoon matin√©e. A pity, because the real love story is glossed over: Duke and Ally's struggle to preserve their love in the face of oblivion.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

The Memory Play's Tricks,"""As teenagers, Allie (Rachel McAdams) and Noah (Ryan Gosling) begin a whirlwind courtship that soon blossoms into tender intimacy. The young couple is quickly separated by Allie's upper-class parents who insist that Noah isn't right for her. Several years pass, and, when they meet again, their passion is rekindled, forcing Allie to choose between her soul mate and class order. This beautiful tale has a particularly special meaning to an older gentleman (James Garner) who regularly reads the timeless love story to his aging companion (Gena Rowlands),"" according to the DVD sleeve's synopsis.""The Notebook"" is a pretty and predictable love story. Mr. Gosling and Ms. McAdams never seemed (to me) like they would age into characters like those essayed by Mr. Garner and Ms. Rowlands. Many times, the younger lovers appear to be modeling, rather than playing, their roles. The older couple is more enjoyable. Garner's performance, and narration, is particularly strong. James Marsden (as Lon Hammond) and Joan Allen (as Anne Hamilton) have interesting, underdeveloped roles. (Ms. Allen may been channeling Ellen Burstyn's ""Lois Farrow"").The ""teenage"", and later, undressing scenes are very funny. And, some of the characters' implausible actions (the 365 letters, for example) could be explained as embellishments and/or enhancements made by Rowlands' character, in her ""The Story of Our Lives"" account. It is interesting that the lead characters write, at different times, a prolific amount of material to be read at a later time. With the exceptions of Robert Fraisse's photography and Gosling's dirty undershirt, the film applies too much gloss.****** The Notebook (5/20/04) Nick Cassavetes ~ Ryan Gosling, Rachel McAdams, James Garner, Gena Rowlands",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Mediocre movie at best....,"I started off this movie, anticipating a great watch as depicted by the very high rating. Much to my disappointment, the movie failed to impress.

Performances by Ryan Gosling was okay but Rachel Mc Adams failed to impress, seemed to me all her scenes were overly done, with extreme anger or extreme opposite.All in all, do not anticipate a classic movie here or you will be disappointed.

It will touch you.,"Love stories are often about the excitement and romance of falling in love, something most of us have gone through ourselves. But what made this movie so great for me was the devotion and the pain that was born from the love. When my mother died, I (along with my father and other family members) reflected back on her life. Through her final years, our focus had been on the insecurity and moodiness she showed during her illness. But with the mourning in her passing, our focused turned to where it should have been all along - to her whole life and all the good that was born from the love she shared with my father. This movie has caused me to again reflect not only on my mother, but even more so on my father and his loss. The love my parents generated in their youth (according to my father's accounts) was passionate and exciting, but it was the love that grew over the years and matured in the sunset of their lives that was most beautiful and everlasting. This movie, more than anything, drives home the most important aspect of love - the commitment, devotion and sacrifice that can result only after years of growth.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Beautiful!!! I am still in tears.,"What can I say that has not been said already? I only had this movie because of a curiosity in Rachel McAdams after seeing Mean Girls. I had forgotten the why when I watched it, not expecting much. It starts off slow, but give it about ten minutes and you are hooked! It's a captivating story far beyond the average movie.This is one of the most beautiful and romantic films I have ever seen! It moved me like no other movie has. Sure I have felled a few tears before, but this time I was in tears, not in sorrow, but because their love was so beautiful! When he reached the end of the notebook, I thought there was no way it could benefit from any further storytelling. I paused the movie and calmed down a bit before I went on, only to be in tears when the credits rolled. It's just beautiful! Need I say I'm a 27 year old man? I cry once a year. Maybe! If you haven't seen this film yet and have a heart in your body, you have to see it! Especially recommended for couples of all ages.

The best love story I've ever seen!,"This is by far the best romantic drama I have ever seen, and it would be difficult for future movies to compete with it. Although movies with elements of romance tend to get shot down so easily by viewers, I definitely thought ""The Notebook"" was worthy of a positive judgment. The story was beautiful and I can not think of one way I would change it. This is not simply a movie about two people falling in love and living happily ever after. It is a movie that gives you a view of how two people in love can find their way back together after a cruel separation. If you have not seen this movie in the theater, I encourage you to rent it when it comes out on DVD. I know it's a love story, and you may be figuring that it may not be worth your time, but I can assure you that there is nothing typical about it.

It took a long time but I finally watched it...,"This movie was widely talked about when I was in high school. I never did take the time to watch it but just knew it was a romance movie that seemed to make everyone cry. Finally, after all these years later, I can cross this movie off my watch list.The good: I don't think I have ever seen a movie that had me both filled with joy but also brought so much tears. To be honest, I think it's due to how well the actors portrayed the emotional scenes. I get it now. I see why this movie is loved. The romance is realistic in the sense that it's not perfect. I will admit there were a few cute moments. While the movie may be a little long, I think it was necessary in order to tell the full story in an organic way.The bad: The sexual gratification is something I disliked especially when you consider the age of the characters during the first encounter and the situation during the second. Despite the good moments the romance has, it also has bad moments that had me question the love between the characters. The manipulation and insecurity the characters have is not romantic. It doesn't mean the movie is completely bad. Just got to make sure you have a mature mindset while watching and not glorify it. Even with the bad, I don't regret watching it.

A hugely surprising film from Hollywood.,"I watched this wonderful, beautiful film last night knowing absolutely nothing about it and was totally captivated by its softness, delicacy and truth-a combination not often seen in American movies. I saw no crime, no bloodshed and no guns but the human drama that was played out before our wet eyes was that which we can all relate to through all the convolutions of human existence.I don't watch movies that I don't think I'll like; therefore, in the first minute I know that this is going to be watchable and if it is, then I have no eye for mistakes-if the movie has swept me in I am its captive and I will care nothing for possible mistakes. If I'm not mistaken the first scene was that beautiful image of Noah rowing a boat in the darkening evening on one of those lugubrious South Carolina rivers-I was hooked! I was not disappointed until the house lights came on at the end and I have nothing but superlatives for the acting, the script, the camera work, as well as the direction. Just the staging with those beautiful classic cars rolling around rural Carolina should be enough to win over any naysayer.Do yourself a favor-see this film and choose a dark area of the theatre with few people around.",,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
I liked it !!,"I am a James Garner fan and this is why I watched the movie. Would I have watched if Garner wasn't in it probably not but I found myself being more and more drawn into the story and how it was being told. I thought the way the movie played out was excellent and the way the director set it up was excellent also. The narration and going from present to past really kept me interested and trying to figure out what was going on. In the back of my mind I thought something would happen, like Garner being Noah but I was still surprised when it ended. I was disappointed by the sad finish but when you think about it should it have ended any other way ? I know sad sappy movies aren't supposed to be 'guy movies' but I thoroughly enjoyed this and have watched it several times.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Barely misses The Mark,"OK, I normally will not comment about so called ""Chick Flicks"" but I feel this one here had great potentional, even Academy award potentional, but falls short because of 2 factors, The cons;1. Ryan Gosling; a poor choice here to play Noah. First he gives a dull non inspired performance here. His ""Younger Noah"" does not match up with the older one AT ALL!! Simply stated he has no spark and no reason to be seen as "" a special guy"" that could invoke a ""special love"" His performance leaves me wondering; ""why does Allie fall for this guy?""He really does not seem to be in love, well not in ""Great Love""Colin Farrell would have been my choice here to play NoahGosling seems better suited for a love interest on a soap opera, and he is the main reason this film misses the mark to greatness..2. The film felt and flowed like 2 separate films, with the first half of ""The Romance"" making no real sense. There is no character development and we know little to nothing about Noah AS A PERSON; which as per the above is mainly due to Ryan Gosling's boring and dull performance portraying Noah. Where is his passion? He really does seem like a typical red neck future drunk loser and this disconnects from the older Noah.We are supposed to understand why Allie would fall for this guy beyond the simple ""he is from the wrong side of the tracks"" scenario. I understood why Noah could fall for Allie, but not the other way around!!Many people are from ""the wrong side of the tracks"", SO WHAT? WHATS MAKES ANY ONE OF THEM STAND OUT, err CHARACTER, PASSION, UNIQUENESS? Gosling beings none of these to this lead and he almost ruins this film for me.Pros;1. The story of the older man reading to the older Woman who is suffering from Advanced Dementia is touching and original, especially when we find out why. Both Gardner and Rowlands are great here in these roles and this made the film in my opinion watchable and interesting.2. James Gardner, Gena Rowlands, and Rachel McAdams.The first 2 mentioned here are simply very good in their perspective roles. Where I was very surprised was the performance by Rachel McAdams. She really carried her part of the film. I have read where people here say ""she and Gosling really had good chemistry"" well she has good chemistry with James Marsden as well. Its not because of the male leads in my opinion, its because McAdams really shines here, and I had a lowered expectation of her going in to this film; ""Hey, isn't this the girl from The Hot Chick and mean girls playing a serious lead? Common she cant act.. haha I was wrong!!!McAdams is the scene stealer every time and she out acts Gosling about 10 to 1. She gives you the sense of the passion thats supposed to be here Between Noah and Allie when Gosling fails at it, She carries him in this film and Mardsen. although Mardsen does give an acceptable acting job.Her portrayal of the 17 year old Allie is wide eyed, spunky, and right on the mark. Her portrayal of the 24 year old Allie is mature, tamed and right where it should be, again hitting the mark.It seems to me McAdams has a nice future in film and it goes to show you that some actors when giving the chance CAN REALLY ACT,(Nicole Kidman comes to mind finally getting good roles and shining in them) while others given the chance STILL SUCK!! (Gosling, well as a romantic lead err, SUCKS!!)The premise for this film is original, and 3 out of the 4 leads act very well. This film is not as ""Diabetic unfriendly"" as some people would have you believe, but is not sugar free either. What bothers me is we don't have enough character development, again with Gosling's portrayal be first and foremost lacking.If we were able to change that, then this film would be an academy award nominee, A good film in spite of its flaws but not a great film. Remember people, because a film makes you cry don't make the film great. I've seen people cry watching Soap Operas and Hot Dog eating contests as well!! scores as follows;1. a take a date to flick  2. originality= 7 (10 for the premise) 3. acting = 8 (would be 10 but Gosling takes away allot) 4. Kleenex needed? YES BRING A BOX!! (and save it for the very end)finally; Academy award nomination potentional?Supporting actor=Gardner=Maybe excellent acting Supporting actress Rowlands=Maybe= excellent Lead Actress= McAdams;I'd say yes if she had a good leading man(Like Colin Farrell) to have worked with. Simply put, she just really carries Gosling too much, all the chemistry is from her, for this reason, she won't get a nod which is too bad, This lady has the potentional to be a top actress.Movie=NO Director=good job but no. Other awards, possibly (cinematography is excellent, set design and costume)Rasberry ward for worse actor? YES FOR GOSLING!!over all 7 out of 10, Recommended highly for the 3rd date to 5th date scenario, but not a first date scenario!!",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Of Halcyon Days and Love-Lorn Emotions ! Brilliant !,"No matter how indifferent and self-absorbed you are , you will be moved ! Truly Sensational ! If you have been wanting to break down and cry and let it all out for a long time , this movie is tailor made for you. The movie at some point of time, will most certainly let you relate to events within your life. A simple love story, superbly portrayed with an impeccable soundtrack in the backdrop of some breathtaking sceneries will suck you towards itself in an almost maudlin experience. Sometimes you could just feel all that love populating the story. Personally, the unforgettable experience that this movie is probably wont fade itself to oblivion for quite some years to come. If you wanna rent a DVD for Valentines, look no further.Ryan Gosling plays Noah , the young love-struck go-getter while Rachel McAdams plays his love interest, young Ali. The pleasant soundtrack and the wonderful cinematography leaves you in one of those halcyon days of peace and tranquility. You will go totally immersed in the movie as the two go crazy in love with each other , not able to keep their hands of one another. Just when you expect the typical love story to unfold, it hits you with a wonderful twist leaving you guessing all over again. One wonderful aspect of this movie was the absence of the usual stereotypical clich√©s of movies in this genre.Gosling brings an almost incredible innocence to the role of Noah. Even with the beard, the innocence doesn't hide itself. Rachel on the other hand brings a lil bit of ""Mean Girls"" into this movie, only for the good of it, which helps in keeping with her character in the movie. Joan Allen also puts in a pretty decent performance while she contributes to the movies emotional allure.The final sequence of events although believed to be the climax of the movie, isn't quite. The movie all over is the climax. From the moment it immerses you into itself it is a climax.

"it's a schmaltzfest, but it's watchable","This movie is engaging, and the photography is pretty. Everyone seems to have liked it.. even dads. The period details are thorough, succeeding to conjure the atmosphere of a simpler, more romantic time. However, it is hard not to feel tricked when movies do this because of course life has always been complicated and dizzying, scarcely turning out to be as wonderful as it was dreamed. There is a shadowy area between what is actually romantic and what is romanticized to the point of artifice. The romanticizing in this movie can be excused somewhat because of the characters' states of being-- the story is mapped out in memories of people who desperately attempt to re-envision them, to savor the beauty of their relationship before time runs out. We all romanticize the past.But the spirit of the old man Noah to me seemed too jazzy. It's especially evident in his conversation with the nurses. In addition to his lines, maybe the casting could be blamed for this. The personalities of the old man Noah and young Noah were too divergent. People only transform so much over time, and the reticence of young Noah just seemed too much in place to produce such a lively old guy. Rachel McAdams is a pleasure to watch, even though her performance was rather unvaried, including much coquettish giggling on the other side of puffed-up fussiness. Gosling turned out to be less fun than he promised at first. Parts of the script were good, others unbearable.. the whole bird thing comes to mind.In the end, most of my complaints are simply a matter of taste, as with any review. I thought this movie could use a little criticism.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
"Deep, moving, sentimental love story for the ages","Every once in a while, you come across a movie that moves you deeply and touches your soul. This is one of them. We are introduced to an older man who tells a tale of two young lovers and their budding romance. How they first met, moments they shared with one another, and how their newfound love grew into a passionate romance. But alas, like many young lovers in love, the girl had to move away for her studies.Containing full of emotions, both highs and lows, this movie moved me deeply. Tears streamed down my face in moments throughout the movie. I felt for the characters and the lives they lived. It felt so real. Towards the end of the movie, I felt so sad coupled with a wealth of different emotions for the characters. It is funny how life is so fleeting. And it is these moments in our lives where we feel alive that we remember and cherish deeply in our hearts.This movie has helped me to remember what it means to love someone so deeply. So much so that you would do things for them that you may not otherwise would do. It is a tale that delves deeply with matters of the heart. And what it means to be in love. I highly recommend this film to anyone who wants to be moved, to be romanced. To feel overwhelming joy and deep sadness. To feel what it means to be human finding meaning in life through love. - 10/10, highly recommended!",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

It's good (I'd say a 7 on the scale of 10), but not the real story of the movie.An elderly man (whom I can relate to because I'm writing this on my 81st birthday) has an interest in a co-resident of his nursing home, an old woman who seems ""out of it,"" but who responds somewhat to the story he reads to her each day -- of the young lovers. (That story, of course, is told in flashbacks, and constitutes maybe 90 percent of the movie. I can relate to it, too, because the lovers are just about the ages of my wife, of 60 years, and me.) However, a second story also develops between the contemporary elderly people, that to me is the heart of the movie. My wife called it a tear jerker. I agreed, though I hadn't shed any tears. Nevertheless, unlike most movies that are forgettable, this one remains vivid, and doesn't lose its punch with time. When I thought about it the next day, I was, indeed, moved emotionally. It's a beautiful story, and if you don't get it, I'm sorry. You need to be alert to catch the point -- or ""punch line"" -- as the ""Notebook"" is shown in a close-up near the end.A beautiful, and marvelous movie! It loses just a point in the ratings because of unnecessary, though implied, sex -- not characteristic of movies of the 40s. (The CODE, you know.)",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
The biggest tear jerker ever!,"Wow.. I have never cried this much over a movie in my life. I saw it last night and everyone in the theatre was blubbering like little school girls! Everyone says that Romeo an Juliet is the saddest, most romantic love story of all time... well sorry Shakespeare, I think The Notebook takes the cake. This movie was excellent. It's the ultimate chick flick! I think that the next time I go see this movie, I'll make sure to wear water-proof mascara... this movie will turn you into a racoon faster than anything. I only wish that I had gone to see it with my sweeheart... I would recommend seeing this movie to anyone who is having relationship problems... grab your sweetheart, and just take them to see this movie... There's no way you could fight after it.",,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Notebook a little disappointing,"yes, i'd heard some interesting things about this movie & surprisingly I've always quite enjoyed a romantic tale if done right. Don't get me wrong I enjoyed The Notebook but many issues of the film let me down. The transitions between the flashbacks and the present were messy I couldn't help but feel as though I cared little about the older characters. Such transitions are better suited to a book where there are defined chapters, i would have preferred the director/editor to create a more unique way to link in the two concurrent stories. Also, I couldn't really engage into the older characters, granted the tale of forgotten love and losing one through memory loss is a harrowing and deeply sad situation, I just felt as though for whatever reason, this issue was dealt with kinda cheesily by the film. A lot of this rests, I believe, with the older character of the husband, I found him to be very wooden and a poor fit for the younger character, the relationship between the characters as their younger selves and the older selves felt very forced and not at all as a singular flowing tale. The final issue that griped me was the abrupt end to the younger tale. I would have preferred to see a little more of Annie's transition into her chosen path in life, instead we were left to just leap onto the tale of the older characters which weren't nearly as engaging. That being said however the tale of the young loves carried enough weight for me to suitable engaged and still enjoy the film.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

"Actually, its not that bad...","Its a chick flick, that's a given. But surprisingly, despite the fact that its completely predictable, its a pretty good movie. And this is strictly because of the acting of both Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams. The roles played by James Garner and Gena Rowland were decent, but they seemed to get in the way of the tale of the young lovers (like the time where its ""lts break for lunch!""). Still, its the performances of the young couple that made the girls cry when I saw it, and the guys (both of us) at least have fun making comments a la Mystery Science Theatre 3000. In summary, yes its a chick flick. Yes its sappy. Yes its predictable. However, its sufferable. (could be worse. It could have starred Kate Hudson!)",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Good but NOT Great,"First of all I have to say I'm a fairly picky when it comes to romance dramas. There is nothing wrong with this film. It even adds something new to a typical romance. It's one of those movies where perhaps if you haven't seen thousands of movies you'd think it's good going on great, but for me it's just good.Perhaps I can't relate to the young couple in love that always gets into heated fights but still are madly in love with each other. That's just too Hollywood for me. In real life I've yet to see a relationship like that last.To sum up there really isn't anything wrong with this movie.

Very Meaningful,"My husband and I had gone out to dinner to celebrate our 58th Anniversary. We had planned to watch a new Pay-For-View Movie when we returned, but happened upon ""The Notebook"" and were soon mesmerized from the beginning to the end. It was a perfect conclusion to a memorable occasion, especially for two who married very young, have been together so many years, and are presently approaching the age of 80. We had to choke back tears at the end.I was especially impressed that, before she had completely gone into her own world, Allie had written a note asking Noah to read the story to her when she could no longer remember the events. She was completely lost in the plot each day when he came to read to her. I wanted to believe that she would eventually find her way back to reality, as she did, if only for a short time. The most tender moment, of course, was when she again realized who Noah was as he climbed into bed with her.Our daughter was thrilled that we had shared this movie together, as she had seen it and also owns it.

Beautiful story,"An old woman is in a hospital and an old man goes there every day. The man always reads a story which is a love story long time ago.This film consist two time bases. One is now in the hospital and the other is 1940s. Mainly, the film shows Noah and Allie in 1940s. They fall in love but war and difference in social standing make them break up.The story is beautiful and sad. So I always cry even if I've watched many times and I know the whole story. I think it is because we can empathize with Noah and Allie with two time bases. Maybe many people dreamed of love story like this, once. I can understand why this film won 12 awards.And Allie's costume is very nice. She wears 1940s's clothes and it is colourful and rich.

"Romantic, But --","I haven't read the Sparks novel, but this was clearly a fictional story -- romantic and a sentimental tearjerker (an old man to my right couldn't stop crying through much of it) complete with flights of white geese and swelling orchestra music in key moments. A great subject for consumption by the aging baby boomer population as it tries to sentimentalize aging with Alzheimers'. A great wish-fulfillment story that had the phrase, ""Yeah, Right!"" running banner headlines through my mind through most of the final hour of it. This is not a bad film to see if you enjoy Disney-movie style happy endings though. The cinematography, script, etc all look like a major release picture and the younger stars are quite captivating and convincing.

"Touching, sentimental story of star-crossed lovers...","Not since SPLENDOR IN THE GRASS has a love story so rich and tender touched my heart as THE NOTEBOOK--although, when reviewing it, I must confess its length is the main weakness. Surely, some editing would have improved the overall impact of the love story.It's the rich girl/poor man kind of tale with physical attraction being the glue that holds them together at the beginning until their love deepens and it seems inevitable that theirs will be a lifelong bond. Then the girl's wealthy parents disapprove of the affair heading toward the altar and scheme a way of separating them by sending the girl off to New York and leaving her love behind in the mid-west. His numerous letters to her are kept from her and gradually she comes to believe that their love has died out and is wooed by another, wealthier young man (JAMES MARSDEN) who is serious about cementing their relationship.But the love story is framed by a flashback technique that has the man, Noah (JAMES GARNER) telling the story to an elderly lady in a nursing home (GENA ROWLANDS) who encourages him to tell it, telling him she likes ""this kind of story"", before she realizes, at the end, that the tale is about her own relationship with him. She is a woman in the early stages of Alzheimer's and at one point suddenly turns on him and says, ""Who are you?""It's an unabashed tear-jerker, the kind I thought they didn't make any more, and it's a well crafted one with shimmering color photography of outdoor locales and extremely well acted by a more than competent cast that gets every nuance out of the complex characters.RYAN GOSLING as the young Noah is outstanding, perfectly capturing the enormous feelings he has for the girl, and RACHEL McADAMS is wonderfully sweet and sassy as the girl who has to decide which man she will spend the rest of her life with.For anyone wondering if they still made tear-jerkers in this jaded and cynical age of hard-edged films, this one fills the bill. Not since NATALIE WOOD and WARREN BEATTY went through all the triumphs and tragedies of bittersweet love in SPLENDOR IN THE GRASS, have I seen a romance as touching and poignant as this one.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

The film is a little lacking in some places but rewarding.,"The Notebook, was in my opinion, a classic love story. The amazing thing about it was, the actors looked like regular people and the story itself could be the story of many people. Which was refreshing, because too often do great stories get ruined by big names, and people who are just too pretty to be convincing as regular people. I myself, know nothing about 'true love,' find myself caught in the weave of the film.Although the opening was well photographed, it was not a good choice, because it is just boring. Some parts of the film could be enhanced by music, instead of just dialogue, and some of the dialogue was a little cheesy, but hey, its a love story.Performances by Ryan Gosling, and Rachel MacAdams are extraordinary. James Garner is as always amazing as well.The movie begs the question; what is the nature of true love?My advice, if you haven't seen it, DO.

The characters were not very well chosen, and the storyline is too obvious. The script is poorly written. Not to mention that the writer of the book ""Note book"" is very conventional writer. I don't know how our society accepts a film with no creative spirit. I really think that this would be a great movie for maybe for relaxing time, but there is no need to really involve thinking as a matter of fact.

Heartwarming and Beautiful,"This film is touching. Actually, I don't like love stories, but this film is so great that I was blown away. In the beginning, this film goes on by reading a story for a woman. The story itself is a rich girl and a normal guy who fall in love with each other like Romeo and Juliet story. Her parents are against their marriage, however their true love is the most moving part of this film. Noah loves Alie from the bottom of his heart so that he builds a house for her and writes 365 letters. The story is a typical love story, but I was attracted by the pure love between them. We don't know whether Alie chooses Noah or her lover until the final scene, and the development of the story is more interesting than normal love stories. That plot is one of points to make this typical love story elaborated. Other than that, scenery in this film are so beautiful. The ending is so dramatic and wonderful.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
"Very romantic, but stereotypical and hardly convincing","After seeing Lalaland (Netflix), I remembered Ryan Gosling from The Notebook and watched the film again. That revisit was not only a pleasure.What struck me first was probably the film's strongest aspect: it is a dazzling range of pretty pictures and a hot romance. But all that
potential magic gets undermined by minor and major flaws in the story. Of course this story is super romantic and in that sense, it gets away with a perfectly burning fireplace, early in the morning, when both lovers are clearly asleep. I would really like to learn that trick. More stupid is the portrayal of Alzheimer's in the film: obviously, the disease serves the purpose of filling a plot hole, which had been ok, had it been done properly. Let's not mention that even World War Two is misused way too lightly.

One of Those Love Stories That Will Go Down in History,"Noah Calhoun sees Allie Hamilton across the fairgrounds and falls instantly. He persuades her to date him, and before long a summer romance blossoms. But can a love survive class differences, a world war, an evil mother and years of time? If you believe in love -- true love -- this is a film you have to see.I watched this movie for the wrong reasons with the wrong person, and liked it anyway. The wrong reason was because of the persistent rumor that you could not watch this movie without crying. Especially if you cried during ""A Walk to Remember"". Well, I streamed tears pretty heavily during AWTR, much to the amusement of my girlfriend at the time. But I did not cry at all during ""The Notebook"". Though the person I watched it with was a bit moist in the eyes. That person was my good friend Kenn, which I think made the film less sentimental because he's not exactly the person I ideally wish to cuddle up with.I loved Ryan Gosling in this film, especially with the righteous beard. I'm not so sure about the casting of Rachel McAdams, though. I'm quite certain her character was supposed to be as air-headed and annoying as she is, but I just didn't find her likable or attractive. Gosling could have done so much better. (But I'm a Mandy Moore fan, so I'm a little biased.) The basic elements of love are here: don't listen to your parents, don't worry about money. Follow your heart. True loves conquers all. It's not a new story in any way. Sure ,you don't find many films with guys who climb moving ferris wheels, but the basics are here. The other plot, of a woman who lost her memory, is very emotional, but not very riveting for me. I just didn't really care about her (which is probably another reason I didn't cry). But yeah, even ""The Incredible Hulk"" has a love story, so it's not like this is unique.When it comes down to it, if you need a romance movie and you want some sadness and heartbreak and a good cry, I guess you'll want to watch this. Don't be expected to be blown away like others would tell you. Critically speaking, it's not a dynamo. But emotionally, if you're the sort who loves a timeless story of true love, this ranks up there with ""The Princess Bride"" (though it's not nearly as funny).",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

Pretty good but not earth shattering,"I enjoyed this film but certainly it was not magnificent. The film was for the most part a basic love story. Wonderful acting performances, wonderful vintage feel to the film with costume,settings and general atmosphere. The setting for a good film was ripe. I felt the film did become too predictable and overly sugary. This was clich√© to say the least. The movie got me gripped from the get go, which I suppose is a good thing. The film just seemed too flat at certain junctures.Yes , there were some tearful moments, but there were also moments of yawning. I do believe Noah and Allie truly did have that once in a lifetime connection that culminated in a fine story. I also believe that the writers were too safe with this script. Tastefulness is always fine, but sometimes a film can be too tasteful , and this was the case with this film. Other than some cute wooing antics, that boys will be boys will succumb , there was not much in the way of risk. This film was too vanilla.

The Notebook,"The Notebook is an amazing romance movie with more excitement and sadness than any movie I have ever watched. It begins with a poor boy who is trying to be with a girl who comes from a rich family. At first she isn't interested but after spending time with him she falls in love.

I love the fact that this movie shows that if something is meant to be it will happen. I was disappointed that you didn't get to see them grow old together but you can just imagine how wonderful their life was.If I could compare this movie to another one it would be Made Of Honor.

The power of love: a good and well built romantic movie,"After a disappointing ""love"" experience this movie came unexpectedly as a positive injection of sound love and hope to me. I really liked it and felt deeply moved by it, I almost needed it. The story in itself is nothing new, nor original (though I wonder whether there is still something new to be said in the field of love). What stands out is the way, in terms of simplicity and naturalness, which which the romantic story gets to the viewer. No melodrama, no pathetic script, sentimentalist excess is carefully avoided: this is just a simple, moving love-story, plainly narrated through the pages of a diary. It is so easy for the viewer to get involved, both with the juvenile passion, and then with the mature affection, between Noah and Allie, whose story simply testifies that attraction cannot be the only engine of love, and that without mutual, constant and loyal dedication and respect even the most powerful chemistry is doomed to fall miserably. The young actors playing the boy and girl are magnetically well paired, we can feel, sense the passion exploding from their bodies and souls, in the same way as James Garner and Gena Rowlands can communicate high sentiment in a superb way. Also Sam Shepard, as Noah's father, hits the sign, and proves how talented actors, used to more demanding roles, can offer highly professional performances also in lower-level movies and contribute to make a difference. So congratulations to movies like Notebook, which, although not being masterpieces, obviously (but they do not aim at being so considered) have that magic capability to let you go to bed with a soothing and delightful sense of trust, hope, or simply with the momentary illusion (but how much do we need it, sometimes!) that there are still sincere, honest and loyal men outside.

About life and dreams or Two hours of emotional and touching love,"Melodrama. Screen adaptation of the novel ""Notebook"" by American writer Nicholas Sparks. Russian localizers decided to translate the title (as well as the book by the way) ""Diary of Memory"", for which I am even grateful to them, because this name more accurately conveys the essence of this wonderful and touching picture. I will say right away that I have not read the book, but I am going to fix it as soon as life circumstances allow. And I watched the picture itself on the recommendation of a friend - which I did not regret a bit. However, I was sure at the level of intuition that I would like this picture. Intuition did not disappoint me again, and here is my brief opinion - two hours of emotional and touching love. I did not notice any flaws in the picture, although an experienced eye was looking for them, but this time I failed, so I intend to draw your attention to the expressive merits of this soulful and touching melodrama.
So, here they are:
1. Love story - the picture tells the story of an elderly gentleman, who, being in a nursing home, takes care of an elderly lady in every possible way, reading that story of incredible love that has passed a series of tests. Here you can find the difference in the social strata of lovers, the parental question, a long separation, a happy reunion. Every persistence of the elderly boyfriend flatters the lady, and she begins to remember something. I simply have no right to tell you the whole story, because it will be the purest disrespect for those viewers who have not yet watched this picture. Well, those who watched - they all know very well themselves, and they are revising this wonderful picture, because it deserves it. The film raises questions of love, perseverance, devotion to ideals, dreams, care and many more, to which each viewer himself can give an answer. I already have the best love story, but this one deeply sunk into my soul, I can't argue with that.
2. Music - I will not say that it ""blows up the brain"", nevertheless, the music from the picture ""Me Before You"" is much better, but in terms of the atmosphere - it does an excellent job, that's for sure. It conveys the spirit of the era and the very mood of this wonderful picture.
3. Humor - it is practically not here, I counted only two funny moments - but they caused an enthusiastic reaction in me, which I will not be able to forget for a long time.
4. Thoughts - here and selfless devotion to a loving person, and the meaning of life. Here I have collected all the thoughts that visited me when viewing. We will all die, it is impossible to argue with that. But how will we live through the time allotted to us? Each person must decide for himself. Selfless faith, in God, in man, in a dream. Romantics have changed this world, romantics have pushed the boundaries of human knowledge, romantics have conquered this world, and they continue to do so. Romantics changed the world, although they were far from using it. Selfless belief in a miracle, or God, makes people stubbornly pursue their goal, overcoming all obstacles. Perseverance, it can perform a real miracle. Loyalty - loyalty to people - is what deserves attention, even though our age is not as long as we would like. What will each of us leave behind after we die? Each of us has our own path, which we must go through to the end. The main character believed in all of this, and this moved him throughout his life. What drives us?
5. A touching ending - I knew about the ending, but it still knocked out emotions. The film ends on a truly high note, an emotional note that simply cannot be forgotten!
6. Emotions - I thought I could handle it, I thought that the story with ""Hachiko"", ""Moulin Rouge"", "" The Lord of the Rings"" and ""Last Christmas"" will not repeat itself. but I was wrong. Right up to the curtain, the picture was able to knock out my tears, equally sad and happy tears from the ending of this story. Consider me a ""snot lover"" and a ""little girl"", I don't care. Let's see how you react to the ending.
A little about the main characters:
1. Noah Calhoun performed by Ryan Gosling - a poor worker who fell in love with a girl of a different social status. A little eccentric, falling in love - he loses his head, committing the most insane acts. A real romantic who has not lost faith in his dream. Their feelings have to go through a series of tests. It turns out Ryan knows how to play romantic characters, he did not know this, for which I can only praise him. Well done!
2. Ellie Hamilton, played by Rachel McAdams, is from a wealthy southern family who fell in love with a poor guy. Their crazy and beautiful romance is mesmerizing. Not without sharp corners that only enhance their feelings. Rachel made me happy, still young, still naive, but already so sensual and romantic. Clever girl!
By the way, the erotic scenes were a success. They are shot beautifully and with passion, without slipping into vulgarity or outright vulgarity. All directors of melodramas and romantic comedies - take note and take an example!
Will I be reviewing it? An interesting question, which I cannot give an exact answer, because I said that I would not revise two melodramas, but I eventually revised both. Let's wait and see, ladies and gentlemen!
The picture is not a masterpiece, but it definitely deserves a solid ""five""!
Well, at the end I would like to paraphrase the famous phrase of Zhenya Lukashin from The Irony of Fate:
""I have a feeling that during these two hours I have lived a whole life ...""
As a result, we have an excellent emotional and touching melodrama, with an excellent script, great atmosphere, suitable music, lots of thoughts to think about and great acting work.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
"A good old fashioned love story, charmingly told","If you like a good old fashioned love story, this ticks all the boxes.Very well acted and interesting telling via the past and current time.Set in 1940 in jumps forward in time to 'the present' and back as the story is told from 'the notebook'.Not much else to say but have to make up the required word count . This is a very solid 7.5/10 and well worth a watch if you like the genre.Charming tale starts pre world war II and moves back and forth from then to 'modern times' (2004) I liked the fact it kept you guessing to near the end of who the old couple were and a real tear jerker but happy ending.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Touching,"This is a well made film with genuine poignancy. The story is well told without being over melodramatic, the characters are realistic and portrayed by the main actors very well. Rachel McAdams comes across very natural and Joan Allen plays a key role really well although the small side story about her characters past is not needed. I think it's there to explain Allie's mothers harsh actions but to be honest a some mothers would do anything to make sure their daughter didn't make a mistake. This is also a film were Ryan Gosling is well cast. I find Gosling is either good or not really good. This is because he always plays Ryan Gosling. So, if you want the keep it under control, cool, silent type he's right. Anything else and you are left wanting. He is not really good in showing emotion which you think would make this a film not best suited to the actor. However, because McAdams is is so full on lively and emotional his laid back approach plays well as the other side of the same coin.I could have done without the really implausible very end and there were a couple of moments ie Allie's mothers revelation already stated that a a bit too much or too saccharine.Definitely a film to watch if you are after a bit of romance well acted and presented.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
My favourite movie!,"I watched the movie before I read the book so maybe that's what ruined the book for me, but it just didn't compare in my opinion. The chemistry between the two main characters couldn't be any better, the acting is great and believable and I love the storyline too. I definitely recommend this movie to those who haven't seen it.

This is one of the best love stories I have ever seen!,"The Notebook is directed by Nick Cassavetes. This movie takes place in Seabrook, North Carolina in the summer of 1940. The movie begins with an elderly man (James Garner) reading a story to an elderly woman (Gena Rowlands) at a nursing home. Noah Calhoun (Ryan Gosling) falls head over heels at a carnival for Allie Hamilton (Rachel McAdams). Noah is a mill worker, and Allie's wealthy family disapproves of him. Within a few days of being together constantly, Noah and Allie fall in love. Then Allie's parents leave Seabrook and take Allie with them. When Allie moves away, she meets a man named Lon. They spent some time together, and her parents loved him. He asked her to marry him. Right when she said yes, Noah's face came to mind. Noah bought the Windsor Plantation and rebuilt it from the ground up. Allie decides to go visit Noah to see if he is okay. They both still have feelings for each other. Allie has to choose between Lon and Noah.The wardrobe for the movie, as well as the cars, fits really well with the time frame. The music is very old fashioned as well. There is also a lot of symbolism throughout the movie (which I won't give examples of so I don't give anything away).There were a couple of mistakes in the movie. At one part where they are in the Windsor Plantation, Allie says, ""This place is gigantic"" and the words didn't go with her lip movements. There was another part where Allie ran into a stack of logs. Her car wouldn't start back which isn't very likely.Overall I loved this movie. I would recommend it to anyone who wants to see a wonderful love story.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
A GREAT love story!,"I just got done reading everyone's comments on the movie, ""The Notebook."" I remember reading this novel a long time ago and I didn't really recall too many of the details except that Allie had Alzheimer's Disease and her one true love read to her to make her remember. Beyond that, it was kind of hazy! In that respect, the movie was amazing because I didn't really know what was going to happen and I looked forward to every single scene. Ryan Gosling is an amazing actor! I remember when I used to watch him on ""The Mickey Mouse Club"" when he was around eleven-years-old. In one particular scene, he was singing a song and he just looked at the camera and smiled and winked and I thought he had such expression for such a young child--obviously that carried over to his acting career! He's so effortless--not many actors can make you REALLY believe that it's not a movie--that it's really happening. It's like he and Rachel McAdams were really in love--I wonder how she could resist him!! ;) All of the scenes that were mentioned in the other comments are pretty much my favorite ones, too. I have to add one thing, though--when Allie and Lon are talking in the room and he says he wants her to himself and she responds by saying something like she was confused because Noah made her feel like one person and Lon made her feel like someone else. (Forgive me, I don't have it all memorized...yet!). I can totally relate to that! Many times in your life you come across people that you could potentially love and you act different when you're with different people. Everyone has certain qualities that attract you to them and then you find those qualities within yourself as well! That's why this movie is so great--no one here is a bad guy or doing something wrong to make the audience root for Noah. Lon is a wonderful character as well--rich, handsome, gentlemanly, and very much in love with Allie. That's why I can understand Allie's struggle trying to choose because both of them would compliment her and her personality. I bawled my eyes out during this movie!!! For one thing, my dad's name is Lon!! But mostly because it reminds me of my own grandmother and her battle with Alzheimer's. It broke my heart watching Gena Rowlands play the old Allie. How she couldn't even remember her own husband and children. How she didn't remember being able to play the piano (my grandma plays the guitar)--but every so often the light begins to glimmer and something is remembered from the past. Anyway, I'd like to write more, but I need to get off the computer!",,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

Great movie,"""The Notebook"" is a deeply moving film that stirred emotions in me like no movie has in a decade. The love story of Noah and Allie, portrayed with such passion and authenticity, brought me to tears for the first time since my grandfather passed away ten years ago. The portrayal of enduring love, despite life's challenges, is incredibly touching. The film's depiction of Alzheimer's and its impact on relationships hit close to home, resonating deeply with personal memories. A beautifully crafted tale of love, loss, and the power of memories that will stay with you long after the credits roll.TLDR: Great movie, very sad.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

But oh boy what an anti climax.Don't get me wrong, a lot of things are really good in this film. There's nothing wrong with the acting, to be honest I actually think I fell in love with Noah, and the story overall is nor too bad. The main problem is the plot. I'm usually not too good at foreseeing a plot, or at least I try to ignore it, but that was just impossible with this one. It is so obvious what's about to happen, both scene by scene by also the main plot itself.

Best Romantic movie,"My Favorite Romantic movie.very beautiful story,If you are a Romance movie fan,this movie for you,Enjoy",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Very professional and well made movie. Cast & crew overcome the movie its clich√©s.,"""The Notebook"" is better than just your average romantic movie for a couple of reasons.The first and foremost reason for me was the look of it. It had an obvious high budget (at least for its genre) that was well spent. The did a good job at recreating the '40's, with lots of nice looking sets, cars and costumes. The cinematography was beautiful and made the settings of the movie really come forward into the story.As for the story itself it wasn't really anything new and was filled with the typical clich√©s you could expect from a movie about a boy and a girl falling in love, of which one is from the 'upper-class' and the big city and the other of the 'lower-class' and from a small town. Take away the movie its good actors and budget and you'll have your average romantic movie. The story certainly is not strong and thick enough to carry the entire movie on its own. Sure, the movie does have its original moments, especially in its non-linear storytelling but it on its own is not good or powerful enough to make the movie really any interesting.The cast consists out of some really impressive names, mainly the supporting cast. Actors such as James Garner, Sam Shepard and Joan Allen help to make the movie an extra respectable one and they add a certain bit of extra. Really great in this movie was James Marsden. Lots of people criticize him for his part in the X-Men movies, in which he is quite boring but when you watch him in this movie and others you'll notice that he is actually nothing less than a greatly talented actor. The leading actors Rachel McAdams and Ryan Gosling are obviously not just mainly cast for their acting skills but more because of their 'natural' style and look. Every guy should be able to identify himself with Noah and every girl should be able to identify herself with Allie. They deliver their lines in a very natural way and the help to make the story more believable than it in fact really is.Still I feel that the romance in this movie is flawed. It never becomes obvious what it is that makes Allie so great and perfect for Noah and vice versa and why their love is so much more special and powerful than anyone else's. It never gets fully obvious or explained in the movie, at least not to my satisfaction.But for most part the professional cast & crew overcome the movie its clich√©s and weaknesses, until the ending. The ending was completely unnecessary, over-the-top and just mainly totally unlikely and unbelievable. You can say that it sort of ruined the movie its romantic and powerful feeling for me. I would had seriously rated this movie a 8 out of 10, right until the last couple of minutes. The movie should had ended earlier on and abandoned this crazy, unlikely, over-sentimental ending.Still I feel that due to its professionalism involved, I'm talking about both cast & crew, this movie is still way better than just another clich√© filled romantic 'chick-flick'. Even if you aren't into these sort of movies (like myself), this movie is worth seeing and worth your time. It's beautifully made and really no bore to watch, despite the obvious moments and stereotypical clich√©s.See this movie for the whole package, not just the story.7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

Rachel McAdams and Ryan Gosling have a burning chemistry that crosses the screen.

Ryan Gosling could probably be the next Tom Cruise. Having mostly built his career on playing dark characters, he pulled off this romantic lead pretty well.The story itself is touching and does tug at your heart strings.

"THE NOTEBOOK: Above-Average Romantic Drama, But It Becomes Trite When It Tries Too Hard...","THE NOTEBOOKNormally I avoid any movie that is overly romantic or seems especially geared towards females... no offense to those that enjoy them but for me they usually come off as annoyingly trite. However, the hoopla that revolved around THE NOTEBOOK made me curious to see what all the buzz, hype, and admiration was about.THE NOTEBOOK tells the love story of Allie and Noah... two people from opposite sides of the tracks who fall deeply in love over one summer. The story is bookended with older versions of the characters, played by James Garner and Gena Rowlands, sharing the story of their love... however, in her old age Allie has lost her memory. Noah, known as Duke when he's older, tells her their love story every day in the hopes of bringing the love of his life back to him. The idea of bookending the film with the older versions of the characters gives the film a unique approach... but in the end, for me, it just got in the way of what is a truly great love story.THE NOTEBOOK is only truly alive when it focuses on the story of their young love, played wonderfully by Ryan Gosling and the always magnetic Rachel McAdams. Though their courtship and trials are often clich√©d, the romantics are elevated by the wonderful performances of these great actors. The scene in which they first fall in love walking down the streets after seeing a movie is truly wonderful.Romantics work best for me when they are played in a very honest, and believable way. As soon as contrivances and over-sentimentality creeps into the picture I become disinterested or overwhelmed. The story of their young love is grand and perhaps not completely realistic... but the performances are so honest that it manages to keep the film grounded.Rachel McAdams and Ryan Gosling have a dynamic chemistry together whether they are fighting, playing, joking around, or making love. Every emotion and every up-and-down of their relationship is beautifully realized. McAdams continues to impress me (has anyone seen anything besides a great, engaging performance come from her... cuz I haven't) and Gosling was great as the male lead (it helps that he's not traditionally good looking or overtly ""charming"" and ""suave""). The supporting work from Joan Allen is very strong as well as Allie's overprotective, oppressive mother. Her scene with Allie in the car at the end is wonderfully played.However, despite valiant efforts from the great Gena Rowlands and James Garner... the bookends ultimately cap off the picture on a bad note. I won't give away the full ending, but something about it was just wrong. The editing and cuts in one scene especially felt incredibly awkward and out of place. And the whole situation in the end really felt far too contrived and emotionally manipulative for the audience.I'm someone who shuts down emotionally as soon as a film feels like it's trying to make me cry as opposed to just letting me go along on a genuine emotional ride. This is what ultimately hurts the movie. The manipulative aspect of the bookended structure.Still, the film is better then your average romantic drama. It has enough genuine moments to give the film some merit (all provided in the flashback portions, which thankfully make up most of the film). I can appreciate the heights that THE NOTEBOOK aspired to reach, and it truly does in some moments. But Nick Cassavettes, the film's director, should be carefully of reaching too far... b/c he makes that mistake a few times in this good, but not perfect film....

An Immortal Symphony of Love,"Few cinematic creations have encapsulated the beauty, pain, and resilience of love as profoundly as ""The Notebook"". This 2004 romantic drama, directed by Nick Cassavetes and adapted from Nicholas Sparks' bestseller, has engraved itself in the annals of classic love stories, stirring hearts with its timeless romance and unforgettable performances.The narrative unfolds as an elderly man reads from a worn-out notebook to a woman in a nursing home, traversing back in time to the fervent love story of Noah and Allie. Noah, a passionate yet penniless young man, and Allie, a vibrant yet socially elite young woman, find their summer love tested by societal expectations and the tumult of World War II. As the story unfolds, the movie enthralls the audience with an emotionally charged journey marked by separation, longing, and the relentless power of love.A key component of the movie's indelible charm lies in its performances. Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams share a compelling chemistry, creating a believable and moving portrayal of love in all its rawness and splendor. Their performances are tender yet passionate, drawing the audience into their world of unyielding love and commitment. James Garner and Gena Rowlands further augment the narrative, providing a poignant and heart-wrenching portrayal of love's endurance in the face of life's inevitable twilight.The movie is also a technical triumph, enhancing its emotional depth with a remarkable score and evocative cinematography. The idyllic visuals of South Carolina beautifully complement the narrative, and the music intensifies the film's emotive strength, leaving the viewers teary-eyed and profoundly moved.The storytelling may be criticized as cliched or melodramatic, but this dismissal ignores the movie's nuanced portrayal of love's resilience and the inevitability of life's imperfections. Despite the predictability of the plot, the movie is authentic in its depiction of life's harsh realities, emphasizing that love, in its truest form, transcends these trials.In conclusion, ""The Notebook"" is an ode to enduring love, a cinematic masterpiece that captures the essence of devotion, passion, and commitment. Its vivid portrayal of love's undying spirit resonates profoundly with the audience, prompting them to contemplate love's omnipresence in the face of life's vicissitudes. The movie stands as a testament to love's transformative power, affirming that even in the throes of life's harshest challenges, love persists, love endures, and ultimately, love conquers.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

Director Nick Cassavetes and his Romeo and Juliet, Canadian actors Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams do depict the pain, heartbreak and misery that the stubborn lover cause each other and to others around them.

beautiful love,"This is the most beautiful movie I have ever seen and I wonder why I've heard so little about it in the media. I will recommend this movie to all my girl friends and of course to my mom. I usually cry when I see a movie my heart like ,but I have Never cried like this.

A wonderful movie,"It took me a decade or so to catch up with this 2004 film, by which time its two young stars had carved out impressive careers: Ryan Gosling with leading roles like ""Drive"", ""The Ides Of March"" and ""The Place Beyond The Pines"" and Rachel McAdams with appearances in ""The Time Traveler's Wife"", ""Midnight In Paris"" and ""About Time"". In this early work of theirs, you can see why because Gosling as Noah and McAdams as Allie are utterly convincing as two immensely attractive young people crazily in love with one another in spite of the differences in class and personality.The tale is told through the notebook of the title which, many years later, is read by Duke (James Garner) to a fellow inmate of his nursing home (Gena Rowlands) who is suffering from very serious dementia. It is a powerful story taken from the novel by Nicholas Sparks and ably crafted by director Nick Cassavetes, the son of Gena Rowlands and film director John Cassavetes. Some may find it sentimental, even manipulative, but ultimately all art manipulates our emotions and I simply loved ""The Notebook"".",,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
one of my favorites,"Such great acting and such a powerful love story. I actually prefer it to the book. The chemistry between Rachel Mcadams and Ryan Gosling is so perfect and so beautiful. I always wished that they were together in real life they are so cute together. Anyways, it is such a simple story but it is told with beautiful imagery and great scenes. Even the enemies in this movie own and you hate them so much!!! Rachel Mcadms and Ryan Gosling will always be in the list of my favorite actors and actresses. I love this movie and will always wanna watch it again and again. It is a classic love story to me and it is up there with Titanic in my opinion.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

I loved this movie,"i loved this movie. it made me cry really hard at the end. i mean, come on, who wouldn't cry? and OK,it may have been mushy on some parts, but i mean u can't expect a romance movie to not have mushiness in it and if you don't like mushiness just don't go see romances like this. but i personally loved this film because it was such a beautiful film and it wasn't one of those movies that u would just sit back and barely watch it as u wish for it to be over any second. part of the reason i wanted to see this movie was because Rachel McAdams was in it and i had seen rachel mcadams before in mean girls and i wanted to see her act again in a more dramatic, serious roll. i thought she was excellent in mean girls as the lead mean girl Regina, but she was even better here as Allie. i heard they considered Britney Spears for the role. i laughed so hard when i heard that one. i probably would not go see it for the sole reason that Britney was playing lead, only because it would be a worse movie cause Britney can't act a lick. if u don't believe me, rent Crossroads. But all in all, I really really really liked this movie. I give it a 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
It's All About Love,"The best thing about ""The Notebook"" is probably its simplicity. There's nothing complicated about it. It's all about the love shared by two very different people who have built a life together in spite of their differences, and who face their declining years together, with all the challenges those declining years bring. It's sweet, it's romantic, it's emotional (and, yes, at times it gets a bit too sappy) - it's probably the epitome of what we think of when we speak about a ""chick flick."" And it's very good. The premise is - as I said - surprisingly simple. Allie (Gena Rowlands) is confined to a nursing home because of dementia. She can't remember anything - not even her family. Her husband Noah (James Garner) is fiercely devoted to her, reading everyday from a notebook, in which Allie penned the story of their love, a story that just every now and then drags her back to reality. We move back and forth from the present day (in the nursing home) to the story of their early love. In their earlier days, Allie and Noah (played by Rachel McAdams and Ryan Gosling) overcame lots of challenges and pretty long odds to be together. In their declining years, they have many things to overcome to stay together.It's a pleasant movie - sometimes sad, sometimes hopeful, and always passionate in a loving sense. McAdams and Gosling portrayed the young love brilliantly, but the most powerful scene (in my opinion) belonged to Garner, when - after a brief few minutes when Allie had snapped back to reality and they had shared a dance - is suddenly horrified by the fact that she lost everything in an instant and had to be restrained and drugged to be brought under control. It was the look on his face in that scene that stood out for me. The ending of the movie is both sad and happy, and completely appropriate to the story. In the end, the power of love triumphed in spite of all the odds against it. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

Excellent movie,"I'll keep this short. I have never read a Nicholas Sparks book or seen one of his movies. But this movie was excellent. I don't get into chick flicks so I've avoided this movie, but this wasn't a chick flick as much as it was a movie that simply tugged at your heart through all the ups and downs. I'd never seen Rachel McAdams before and thought she was wonderful. I've seen Ryan Gosling and typically like his work. They were both powerful in their portrayals. I read one review that thought Gosling should have shown more emotion/passion in his portrayal but I thought he played it perfectly - embroiled with internal emotion while revealing very little of it. It is very much the way men tend to operate.Excellent story line, breadth of characters and flow for the work. I'm a guy and I know it's a bit taboo, but if you don't cry at some point in this movie (esp. towards the end), you're just not human. :) Rent it, DVR it or buy it - any option is good, just see this movie.

An emotional masterpiece,"I thought I was going to get in an accident driving home after watching this, I just could not stop thinking about it. If this movie doesn't move you nothing will. It is full of passion, romance, and emotion. The use of the flash backs makes your love for the characters so much stronger. The whole movie is layered with beauty. The casting for this film was very well done. Ryan Gosling has a lot of gravitational pull here in his depiction of Noah. His charming performance shows how much potential he has. You can never go wrong with James Garner. Sam Shepard, and Joan Allen put in very strong supporting roles as parents of the young lovers. The only downfall to such a beautiful story is that everyone is going to go home unsatisfied with there own true love.

A movie that could have been amazing...,"I really hate it when something like this happpens, you have a movie, with an amazing story, with unlimited potential, and then Hollywood has to go and screw it up by casting it with teen ""hearthrobs"". There is so much wrong with this movie it's not even funny. Small stuff that anyone making a movie should know, most of it's just common sense. Ryan Gosling was wrong for this part for a number of reasons, the part needed a good actor. He had about three emotions in the movie, ""smile"", ""loving anger"", and ""lonley"". That's all. The role should be contended for best actor at the Academy Awards, but they had to give it to someone based on looks, it's ridiculous. James Garner and Gene Rowlands were just pathetically fake. Their acting was so over the top and so bad it made me laugh several times in the movie. This movie has a very good story, but it was ruined by Hollywood.

The story touched me because having had an ailing parent with dementia, I sadly understand the frustration of wanting to share love with the individual who doesn't recognize you. Jim's acting was so appropriate, so sincere, and so right as usual. I will definitely add this to my DVD collection and will watch on those special times when I miss mom.

The Notebook is a brilliantly written intriguing story about two young lovers that most people can relate to.,"The Notebook is a brilliantly written intriguing story about two young lovers that most people can relate to. The movie describes how a summer love turned into a pure and inseparable love. The movie is filled with fabulous quotes and sentimental moments which makes people get lost in the story, and forget about their thoughts, or what is going on in the outside world.The movie was adapted from the novel ""The Notebook"" by Nicholas Sparks. Nick Cassavetes directed the movie, making a great adaption. Ryan Gosling brings a great innocence to the role of Noah Calhoun in the film, one of the two main characters. Rachel McAdams plays the other half of the duo as Allie Hamilton. They both gave an astonishing performances along with James Garner who plays old Noah and Gena Rowlands who plays old Allie.The old Allie has a disease called Alzheimer's which makes her forget about her old life, particularly her husband and the life they had spent together. The story unfolds as Old Noah reads her ""The Notebook"" comprising of their young love, how they met, how they fell in love, how their love grew.Noah and Allie gave a remarkably convincing portrayal of a boy and a girl traveling down a very long road with no regard for the consequence of their unconditional love. Noah is a country boy, Allie is from city. Being from a wealthy family, she had the world at her feet while he didn't have two dimes to rub together. With Noah, Allie is a completely different person. She sees her life differently and does what she likes rather than what her parents wants for her. She is like a free bird flying high up in the sky, enjoying her life to the fullest. One of the narration of the movie says, ""The best love is the kind that awakens the soul and makes us reach out for more, that plants a fire in our heart and brings peace to our minds"". That's what they gave each other and that's what people want in their life.It does not matter whether you love romantic movies or hate them, this is NOT just a romantic movie it is so more than that. By the end of the movie you will feel a whole heap of emotions. It leaves it viewers to talk about the movie for a long time. This was one of the best movies I recently saw and would highly recommend to see this epic tale of love.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

It was basically an average love story movie, but it was so good that it feels like you are being told a different story than you hear in every romantic movie. this movie was funny at parts, very romantic, and a tear-jerker. the ending was happy in a sad way (if you've read the book you'll understand). anyways, i really enjoyed it. plus we got free mini-posters so how could that be wrong? haha.",,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

Love's Meanings,"As I viewed this movie, a question transpired. Who was the first person I was especially attracted to? It was long ago in adolescence. I thought the recipient of my attention was more remarkable than any person I had ever met. Everything about her seemed good and nothing bad. I fell asleep each night and woke up each morning with the thought of her. I walked by her house nearly every day. I had less appetite and everyday happenings were hazy distractions from my feelings. I thought of being with her in a state of solitude, togetherness, and tenderness. I ached to see and be with her, and yet shook with anxious anticipation for the moment to come. That moment never came. Nature blessed me, and the aching desire subsided and then was gone. However, her name and memory would unexpectedly flash into my mind, cued by certain people, places, or things. The memories became increasingly fewer but, as evidenced by this reminiscence, never went extinct.I realized eventually that I had fallen in love. My feeling was merely one meaning in a dictionary with many definitions of love. I was hit by the mythical golden arrow of cupid. In some ways it mirrored the definition of a biological addiction.In this film, the mutual attraction of Noah and Allie was akin to both having been struck by cupid's golden arrows. Nature's innate neurons and neurochemicals were transformed into a feeling nurtured by a chance meeting, at a carnival in Seabrook Island, South Carolina. Their attraction was an intense experience of affection and intimacy, in an existence more pleasurable than any other thus far experienced. Noah and Allie experienced upbringings differing in many ways, yet it is said that opposites attract. However, it is also believed that likes belong together. Alas, as the film denotes, their love was torn apart by the vicissitudes of life. However, once again they met by chance and fell in love, but it was different this time. It was not so much that of lovers but that of mutual devotion. It was an emotional bond not easily broken by the vicissitudes of life. The ending was well done and awakened this viewer's emotive self.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

I recommend this to any man who has experienced a first love because this movie perfectly encapsulates that feeling of pure connection, intimacy and raw love.

Pretty good for a romance film.,"I'm definitely not an expert on romance movies, because I tend to generally avoid the romance genre- in both films and books. To avoid cheesiness, predictability, ""syrup"" and endless stereotypes I've always found it more tasteful to combine romance with another genre. That way, you avoid a story's unrealistic obsession with the two main characters. That's not to say that I hate the romance genre altogether- there are some exceptions and times when a story seems to be built at least half-realistically and can actually move me.In this case, although I'd put on my ""skeptic glasses"" I at the same time had a lot more expectation than I usually would because I'd heard so many great things about the film.At first, when I see Noah, I think ""What's the matter with this guy?"" and was about to write him off as a caricature, but his character made me laugh and with a little hesitation I accepted him as actually being realistic. I related to Allie's reaction to him maybe a little more than most because I would've treated him exactly the same way! Through the beginning of the film they kiss...a lot. Again my skeptical goggles are on, and I'm starting to suspect that this is another cheesy romance based on lust carefully- or perhaps, not so carefully- disguised as love, and patiently wait for the characters to mature. On the other hand, I think, they are teenagers, and just because they're horny doesn't mean they don't know what love is. Additionally, I would expect a bit more than that from the intelligent and sometimes sassy Allie and the bat crazy but pretty down to earth Noah. (No, seriously, he's crazy).Anyway, the movie continues on. I don't know if I'm particularly enthralled by the plot, but the actor's and actress's performances are flawless as far as I can see. Especially Ryan Gosling's. The way he looked at Rachel McAdams was a perfect combination of awe and longing, and it made us really believe that what we were seeing was real.Back to the plot: Some of the morals in the story are questionable, but when I say things like that I always battle with question in my mind of whether or not the actions of the characters are always meant to teach us a lesson, or whether or not some of the time they're simply there to display reality. Yes, there are times when Allie could've been more sensible, but really, how many of us haven't been insensible from time to time? As for whether or not true love could've sprang from Allie and Noah's ""summer romance"" is questionable as well. Perhaps even the intervention of Allie's mother in their relationship wasn't as detestable as some might immediately begin to think. I loved this movie in that it didn't take advantage of pathetic stereotypes and create supporting characters just MADE to be hated. It didn't have the ""tunnel vision"" that some romances have, where they almost force you to root for only the two lovebirds by making everyone else a total jerk. Instead everyone had some depth in them, and even though we didn't ""vouch"" for them all the time, we could understand and relate to them.Either way, sometimes they say ""the end justifies the means"" and the ending of the movie was what really touched me. No, I'm not going to spoil it for you, and no, I didn't shed any tears- I very, very rarely do over movies- but this really made me think somehow.This wasn't ""the best romance ever made"" for me- or even really close to it- but it was an enjoyable enough film to watch and it had some pretty emotional moments to it. It even had a little comedy in it (though I must warn that I tend to laugh a lot at films). Again, I must repeat, the performances of Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams were flawless and actually very amazing, and that was the main enjoyment for me.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

Overall - 7/10.The film is good but has its fair share of weird moments. I think the acting was alright but it's felt a bit forced and annoying at times. Noah is a great main but Ally could have done with some work. The visuals were great and the physical acting was better than verbal but still not great. However the stand out part of this film is the soundtrack with its cool soft jazz and uplifting melodies to accompany the climaxes.Overall solid movie wouldn't watch again.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Just couldn't get into it...,"I read the book sometime ago. I read ""A Walk to Remember"" and loved it, so I figured I'd read this one. I didn't care for it, and when the movie came out, I tried to watch it, thinking it would be better than the book. I think I tried watching this movie twice, and it just did nothing for me. Good thing I rented this movie; it would've stunk if I bought it and weren't able to return it. Nicholas Sparks' novels have made better movies than this one. It just seemed so fairy tale to me; that doesn't happen in real life. I found it to be boring, and I didn't even watch the whole thing. Just couldn't; it seemed to drag like a boring class you have to take. Altho I read more of his books and loved them, this one was my least favorite.",1.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Loved it,"I'm not a fan of romantic movies, I usually don't recommend them, I never felt like different watching a movie, I have always prefer watching the same movie that I've watched for the last ten years than seen a romantic movie.But with this one was different, my frien made me watch it, I really didn't wanted to see it, but now, afert watching it, I think that I might have never watch a better movie, or a movie that made me feel like this, I love the characters, I fall in love with both of the main characters, the movie made me feel happy I could say, like if I was watching something real for the first time, like real and first love. But after watching the movie, I felt empty, like if I was missing something, now I know what it is, it's Noah, I need someone who loves me like Noah loves Ally, I need to have a relationship like theirs.If you haven't seen the movie yet, and you are reading this to convince yourself for watching it, or not, let me tell you that I totally recommend it, you won't lose anything by watching it.The movie might be long, but it's definitely worth it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
"The note book is excellent, funny and beautiful","I recently watched The notebook on satellite and i must say, i loved it and cried like a baby. I loved it so much that i actually made my boyfriend buy it for me on DVD a couple of days after watching it on satellite. The love story of the two couples, Noah and Allie, was incredibly heart melting. I must say, for all us girls out there that have long term relationships with a guy,can most definitely relate. I know i did. The way Allie and Noah fought and acted made me laugh and totally reminded me of me and my boyfriend. From the long intense fights to the wonderful make up after we are done.If you have not watched this movie, i really recommend that you do, trust me, if my boyfriend liked it you might too.The note book is amazing.Jennifer Botelho",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Incredible Story of Love,"This will be on every true romantics Top 10 list, and this may well go down as the greatest love story since Casablanca. Guys listen to your girlfriends / wives and go see this movie. I honestly hope that this movie is considered for some Oscars because it deserves some. The acting is incredible, James Garner fans will love his role in the movie. Honestly I can be a pretty harsh critic, but I could not find any fault in this movie. The scenery was awesome, the story just sweeps you away into that all to familiar love you felt with your first love. I can't think of any one thing I would change, and these young actors will get some great roles in the not so distant future I hope. I have never heard of this director before, but I will be looking for more movies from this director. I left this movie knowing that there is a special love out there for everyone. This movie is just fun, and it is a great escape from the real world. Enjoy this movie and plan on adding it to your DVD shelf! I have been disappointed with the Accademy before, but I can't imagine this movie not getting some much deserved Oscar attention in February.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
"Make it stop, make it stooooop!","This overly dramatic, soppy, STUPID film is driving me mad with rage! This film should have a warning at the start, saying WARNING! THIS OVERLY SOPPY FILM WILL MAKE YOU KILL YOURSELF! Jesus Christ, this movie was HORRIBLE!Okay, now that I've gone and had a mental breakdown because of how badly overrated this film is, I've had a talk with my psychiatrist. She said that I am experiencing a thing called ""not following the crowd,"" and that I'm going a little ""mad with rage"" over how bad the film was. She has spoken to me, and we have finally decided to put a stop to the wrong crowd of people from viewing this.I would of rated this film a one if it didn't have a sort of crowd that some people like. It's a soppy romantic drama like The Vow, Dear John and those other crappy films, and those crappy soppy films have a crowd that I just can't understand. The movie (if it can even be entitled as one) is a film with over-the-top emotional music, over-the-top sadness, over-the-top...everything.I think that this film has one of the worst romance plots I've ever seen in film. Yeah, these two are in love! Yippity yay, how sad, BOOOOORING!Overall, if you like romantic dramas, you will enjoy this, but if you don't, STAY AWAY! STEER BLOODY CLEAR!

Super love story,"An old love story ‚Äì the boy from a poor family, the girl, a rich one. Her parents want her to marry the rich boy for security, instead of the poor one for love. Although the plot is old, the story is told exceptionally well - very engaging for the audience. The actors are outstanding. Each brings his/her character to life believably. The fine actors draw us into the story making us care about all the individuals involved. The plot also involves an old woman in a nursing home who suffers dementia. The movie tastefully requires the audience to ponder dementia, and the man who loves this woman. Normally dementia would be an unpleasant topic, but again, the fine acting makes us care about the woman and those who love her. This would be a 4-star film were it not for the immoral behavior of two young lovers. Too bad we can't replace that with honor, restraint, and selfless love.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
It was very moving especially if you are married & love....,It is a very romantic movie and will remind you about when you first fell in love and what you would do to have that love in your life forever. Me and my husband saw it...he loved it probably more than I did...if that is possible. He's a man in every way...a carpenter by trade. I heard him tell others they have to go see it!! You are guaranteed to at least get misty eyed..or have a good cry or two. If not then you are not breathing! I give it thumbs up as well as my hubby! Waiting for it to come out on video and add it to our collection! I would not show it to children under age 12 at least...but I took my children to see it and they weren't upset by it or in shock of seeing sexual scenes. However I probably wouldn't have taken my 10 yr. old had I known beforehand that it went as far as it did. On the other hand...she really loved the movie as did her sister. We also found a lot to laugh at in the movie. Take your parents to see it too...they will love it as well.,10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Very good but to predictable,I really liked the story and the movie. Wonderful and romantic. But it felt to predictable and there was something missing. Maybe because of the lack of depth in the characters. You never really got to know them.Romantic movies usually are like this though and this has to be one of the best but it doesn't is as great as for instance 'pride & prejudice'.I also didn't like the scenes with the old couple. It felt just to much and to unrealistic. I wish they would have cut them out and just showed the story without commentary. It would have given me a bigger impression then I think.I still recommend this movie to everyone.Perfect for an evening with your girlfriend or wife.,7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
"Starts bad, but gets worse!","From the moment of the opening credits you know this is going to be a slooooowwwww film, and it doesn't disappoint. But that's about the only way it doesn't disappoint. It has just about every ""first love"" movie clich√© you can possibly think of, and has nothing new to add to them.Unlike Jack & Rose in Titanic, you have absolutely no empathy for the characters, and there seems to be no good reason for their lives to have crossed. The two main characters keep swapping personality traits throughout the film. First one is weak, the other strong. The next scene it's the other way around.

MADE ME NAUSEOUS,"As a card-carrying romantic, I have to be frank; 'The Notebook' stirred my gag reflex. The characters were flat, the story predictable, and the dialog putrid. About 10 minutes into the movie the audience is forced to swallow a scene in which Noah and Allie are lying in the street watching a stoplight change colors-the scene is meant to be meaningful but it is anything but original or poignant. After this stale interaction between Allie and Noah, I felt myself craving dialog with actual depth in lieu of the hackneyed diatribes and empty banter spewing from the characters' mouthes. Throughout the film, Gosling unconvincingly delivers sugary, sappy lines and appears stoic, awkward, and seemingly removed from the situation despite his assertions of love. MacAdams' portrayal of Allie is somewhat unbelievable, yet spunky. Unfortunately, her already mediocre performance is hindered by the horrid dialog. I also found myself confused with the goals of the protagonists. The film wants the audience to hope for a reconciliation between Allie and Noah, but I was secretly rooting for Lon, Allie's fianc√©-at least he had some personality! There just wasn't much chemistry between Allie and Noah. No amount of bike-riding and necking will create a spark. This film is supposed to be the sweet story of a man who will do anything for his first love.... But aside from a letter writing stint and a ferris wheel stunt, all Noah really does is stare vacantly and renovate a house. Everything about this film is dull and lifeless with the exception of the sometimes beautiful cinematography and the lovemaking scene where Gosling actually radiates some heat! To the film's credit, I did enjoy the older Noah-Allie couple played by Garner and Rowlands. These seasoned professionals managed to shine despite a shoddy script. Don't be swayed to tears by this disgustingly sentimental film, when it comes down to it, it just doesn't have any heart!",,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
The Notebook (2004) **1/2,"I try to be a fair partner when it comes to my relationships with the opposite sex, and unfortunately my girlfriend is a hopeless romantic when it comes to her movies and books. She is willing to check out most of the films I enjoy (with the exception of more explicit horror films; she tells me they give her nightmares), so I think it's only fair that I endure some of her favorites now and then. So last evening we watched her DVD of THE NOTEBOOK. It stars Rachel McAdams and Sam Shepard. Now let me see if you've heard this one before: A young girl (McAdams) is at first turned off to a demonstrative young man (Shepard). Eventually he grows on her and they fall madly in love. Problems arise when the girl's parents feel the boyfriend is not the best choice for her. So she finds another boyfriend. But her first lover doesn't give up... and then...I did not hate the film. Actually, even though it's mostly predictable and it's typical of millions of other chick flicks like it, I did appreciate the way it was structured. It's a story set in the 1940s that's told in flashback from a 2004 hospital as an elderly man (James Garner) reads the story to an old woman suffering from Alzheimer's (Gena Rowlands). The revelation here was not unpredictable either from the get go, but the film itself doesn't make a mystery out of it by the midway point anyway. I did get emotional during the final few scenes of the movie, and I'll tell you one thing - some sad things in life scare me more than those make believe horror films which my girlfriend prefers to avoid. **1/2 out of ****",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

"My ""Review"" Will Go Completely Against The Grain","This is a formulaic ""chick flick"" with the interesting twist that it doesn't focus SOLELY on the ""passion"" of young love but does show that love can endure. I appreciate that as far as it goes.However, as the father of a teenage girl (now 15) trying to rear her with values in this valueless world of ""sex, lies and DVD,"" I must protest.Above all, young women (at least) AND young men with any integrity whatsoever did NOT behave this way in the 1930s and 40s. Such unbridled passion leading immediately to sexual gratification occurred seldom. Usually it was the young woman who, by virtue of cultivated modesty and a sense of personal worth, refused to put herself in such a predicament.Certainly ""stuff happens,"" but this was NOT a typical story. The idea that a young woman, regardless of her depth of emotion, would immediately throw herself into bed with her Summer romance--not to mention one she had not seen for years--is just not reality.Could it happen? Yes. Would it have happened? HIGHLY unlikely. In those days, a woman had far, far too much to lose in such a scandal.This was a matter of taking modern sensibility--where ""love"" equals ""sexual passion""--and projecting it into the past, ignoring all the mores and sensibilities of that era. I repeat: It Is Just Not Realistic that a ""mature romance"" would result from such a shameful act.So, it's only a movie, right? Well, my daughter viewed this with her older, married sister, and was so taken with the story. This is the way that young girls are gulled into believing this dark lie: That ""love means giving yourself to 'him' when the opportunity presents itself.""Meanwhile we have our present-day dilemma, of illicit sexual relations between children with no thought of consequence, risking unwanted pregnancy, abortion, emotional trauma and low self-worth, all because these things are depicted as ""part of romance"". It is NOT reality, and it is reckless.This illustrates all too clearly the widening gulf between ""Real America"" and Hollywood--and why Hollywood has done so much over the last generation to help destroy traditional values and land us in the mess we're in today.In 1999, 79% of all births to women aged 15 to 19 were to unmarried women, compared with about 14% in the 1940s and 1950s (SOURCE: Nonmarital Childbearing in the United States, 1940-1999. National Vital Statistics Reports, 2000). Think of that: Even with contraception AND ABORTION available today, the RATE of unmarried teenage pregnancy coming to full term is more than FIVE TIMES what it was in the time period depicted in this movie.What do you think that irresponsible film-making of this kind has contributed to that problem?If you are the parent of a teenager: What messages are you sending to your sons and daughters by your support of films such as these?",2.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
"Wonderful, breathtaking, choose an adjective for any positive feeling!","This is one of the most moving movies I have ever watched. If the word ""movie"" finds its definition in the word ""moving"" then this one does it 10/10. Wonderful acting and an insanely amazing story.Yes I'm male and yes I cried. This is the unconditional love that everyone should be looking for if they haven't found it already. I haven't and I'm still hoping, but hope is the last that dies. The Notebook just reminded me of what I do and do not want in my life. All these ridiculous things like Tinder and such do not give you what you need. If you want to find love you need to fight for it like Noah does. And you may not let go again. Ever. Thank you Nicholas Sparks and Nick Cassavetes for creating this wonderful piece of art.

One of the Best Love Stories Ever!,"This film is so brilliant in every aspect and ranks at the Top of any list of great love story movies. Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams are superb in the role of two star-crossed lovers who experience all the joys and heartbreaks of unconditional love as do James Garner and Gena Rowlands as lovers in their twilight years. The rest of the cast is also top notch including Joan Allen, as a controlling, but penitent mother and Sam Shepard as a down-to-earth, caring father. The story is simple but it rings so true that it moves one's heart and tear ducts. The cinematography is stunning, the direction well-paced, the music score not to sugary, bland or predictable, but just right to add to the perfection of this film. All the chemistry is there on the screen and it just draws you in to the story almost immediately.

I was skeptical because movies are never as good as the books. But I have to say that I fell so deeply in love with the movie as well as I did with the book. I thought all of the main character did a wonderful job portraying their roles, and had great chemistry. Especially Ryan and Rachel.

location issues,"I have never commented before, but felt compelled because it appears that no one who saw this movie found it hard to believe that in the summertime in South Carolina, our two romantic leads would be wearing winter jackets and having steam come from the lips as the spoke. Anyone who lives in the South knows that it HOT, unbearably hot, in June, July and August. And even if it were a cooler night, no coastal town temperature would warrant a wool jacket.

It tells the story in past tense, which is kinda dumb, until the end when you finally understand. It is classic poor, hardworking guy, and rich, very educated girl romance, but everything isn't just smooth and great. There are a lot of twists, for a love story, and it all works out to be just how you want. This is the perfect movie to take you wife, girlfriend, mom, or even some guys too.

Beginning for Nicholas Sparks,"Sometimes I like to watch a romantic film by myself which is one of my guilty pleasure and ""The Notebook"" is basically the epitome of a romance movie. I first saw it I thought it was okay but isn't anything that special, after a second viewing I can tell this is a heartfelt movie. Which maybe sort of brings homage to the movies back in the old days where young teens or couples go to watch a romantic movie. On the downside this film is formulaic and goes in a pretty narrow direction. Sometimes it feels like it's moving along too slowly and the development of the relationships seem a tad bit too quick, with some more development in some areas would have made the plot movie more in a fluid manner. The dialogue is a bit too cheesy at times and the story when it comes to the love aspect of it, isn't all that original...Even when this movie first came out. It's just the character direction could have been more explored, it seemed like the some scenes got cut out because of the length of the film. Even if Noah is a bit of a awkward name Ryan Gosling played this role really well and Rachel McAdams did a good enough job of acting like a girl during the time period the movie takes place. Although it's a mix of her true personality into it as well, although some part of the movie where she was playing a 17 yr old I found ridiculous. And there were few scenes that somewhat tugged on my heartstrings while watching it, although it was probably because of the music and the atmosphere of the scenes. The poor guy falling for a rich girl has been done before numerous times, this film has it's own charm to some degree. And like I said it isn't a clever romance movie and generic at times but it's a touching and heartfelt love story. If your somewhat like to watch romantic movies or movie for couple's, this movie is worth seeing. I also say the scene with one of Noah's quote ""Would you stop thinking about what everyone wants? Stop thinking about what I want, what he wants, what your parents want. What do YOU want? What do you WANT?"" and other dialogues during that scene left a big impact. It was simply some very good dialogue in a romance film. Which is why I am giving this movie a higher score than I thought I would over a hour and thirty minutes into it. It's a simple love story but well done.7.8/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Favorite movie in my teenage years (but really just a corny fantasy),"Don't you wish you, an ordinary but having some romantic ideas teenage boy, get to meet with a rich and innocent beautiful young lady and get to have some amazing love story with her just because you are obsessed?! Yep, every teenager's dream. Now as I turned older, watching this movie again is just torturing.The story is unrealistic, the characters are completely boring and lack of anything special to remember. It feels like just a bunch of normal people who are thrown into a overly dramatized world. This is like watching a movie that some dude become president of the US when he wakes up one morning - perhaps entertaining at the time when you have very little real life experience.We need to stop making movies like this and make more movies that either have more characteristic people and believable storyline or a movie that is about normal people and their realistic drama in life.",1.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
"Great writing, Great story... Amazing film","This movie has been on my mind since I saw the trailer sometime last year. It totally slipped my mind until a co-worker told me to rent it.This movie was soo easy going and personable that not only did I get emotionally invested, but my husband did as well. At one point, it was so intense and emotionally charged that we almost started hating the writer and director for making such a wonderful movie. At times, I had to just pause the film so I could just catch my breath and so I could continue with watching it.This movie probably has been the best ""love drama"" kind of movie in well over five years. I cannot say enough about this film to even due it justice. I know what I like and to me it is a pretty simple concept. Good writing, good story, good director and most importantly....good cast will more than likely equal an AWESOME movie.

Lifelong love a powerful symbol of good,"Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams are great in this romantic film about a love that lasts a lifetime, crossing a huge divide between two families. From the very start, Ryan Gosling, who plays the role of Noah, falls head over heels for the girl who becomes the love of his life, Allie, played by Rachel McAdams. The two go their separate ways when their summer love affair comes to an end, with the intervention of her parents, who are unable to accept the fact that their daughter has fallen for someone who only earns 40 cents an hour in a lumber job, at the dawn of World War II. The broken-down house that Noah dreams of building into a home becomes a driving force and with some help from his father, Sam Shepherd, and a lot of work, the dream becomes a reality. The ever-competent Joan Allen, Allie's mother, hides the letters that Noah writes while he is overseas during the war, effectively snuffing out the romance, but only for a while. They reconnect seven years later and find themselves drawn again to each other. Despite her engagement to a man she cares deeply for, Allie finds herself in a bind and is forced to decide between the two. Her mother confesses to a similar relationship that she was involved in and abandoned her first love for a secure future but she does return the hidden letters. In a parallel story, an older couple played by two veteran actors - James Garner and Gena Rowlands, whose talents shines in this film, show the tenacity of their love as they reach old age. As an aside, the director of the movie is Nick Cassevetes, son of Gena Rowlands and John Cassevetes. He has made a very beautiful and sentimental movie that shows the power of true love. As with many love affairs, adversity makes the bond of love even stronger. A great love story is always a powerful symbol of good in our universe.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Love beyond all boundaries of youth and mortality. Inspiring!,"My favourite film of all time. Fantastically, utterly believably acted - I got completely drawn into the film, identifying with the characters; artistically filmed with the most beautiful scenes adding to the aesthetic enjoyment, underpinned with beautiful music. Finally a film that captures the reality and transforming power of love beyond the boundaries of youth and of life as we know it. A wonderful counterweight to the usual messages conveyed to us - even daring to mention the word ""God"" at one central scene contrasting science with love (with God). I went to see it four times, the first time ever to do this with any film. Truly inspiring.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
"Reminiscence of romantic young loves - a thorough dramatic tear-jerker for the hopelessly, or hopefully, romantic","So it's quite melodramatic and probably familiar heart-tugging, sentimental plots - but you expect no less from a tear-jerker romance. The trailer of ""The Notebook"" sure beckons the romantics, young and old (since we see Gena Rowlands and James Garner included). It's worth it just watching the intense chemistry firing up, hot and cool, between the two central leads, Ryan Gosling as Noah and Rachel McAdams as Allie - it's a godsend pairing of these two young actors in their blossoming twenties, both from Ontario, Canada. Gosling is a stunner in his brave portrayal of Danny in ""The Believer"" 2001 (controversial subjects in a substantial film, indeed, from w-d Henry Bean). McAdams delivered a wickedly fun Regina George opposite Lindsay Lohan in director Mark S. Waters' ""Mean Girls"" 2004, screenplay by Tina Fey of SNL fame.There's subtle but steady supporting roles from Joan Allen playing the stern opposing mom (with a secret) to Allie, and Sam Shepard as the supportive enduring dad to Noah. The skilful cinematography by Robert Fraisse (responsible for director Jean-Jacques Annaud's ""The Lover"" aka L'Amant 1992) complemented director Nick Cassavetes and the production design efforts. Yes, that swan swarm scene is a true love sight incarnate, seven years or not. Chance and coincidences, in love and war, together or apart, are part and parcel to the plot. I enjoyed the chance of naturally washing my eyes through and through. It's a winning love story, soap or not.Two other movies also based on Nicholas Sparks' novels: ""A Walk to Remember"" 2002 directed by Adam Shankman, another tear-jerker about romantic young loves with an endearing performance from Mandy Moore as Jamie, Peter Coyote as dad Reverend Sullivan, and Shane West as Landon, who pursued Jamie and became a changed young man for the better. ""Message In A Bottle"" 1999 directed by Luis Mandoki, with Kevin Costner and Robin Wright Penn, and Paul Newman as Costner's dad - another lovelorn (tear-jerker) romance, this time more for grown-ups.For a heart-warming and delightful romance with touches of Italian flavor, bread or pie, mother and daughter, an ideal son-in-law, I recommend w-d Melissa Martin's ""The Bread, My Sweet"" 2001, aka Wedding for Bella (DVD title). Scott Baio is Dominic the brainy businessman-brother-baker next door, Kristin Minter is Lucca the long 'lost & found' daughter, and Rosemary Prinz is Bella the life-loving wife & mother in a charming, moving little film.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Dry eyes at cheap sentiment.,"The very fact that this film has a higher rating in IMDb than ""Driving Miss Daisy"" demonstrates the limitations of the ratings system (any ratings system). But if I take one step back and compare the story, direction, cast and acting in both films, I arrive at the conclusion that Notebook compares to Daisy as a mouse dropping to Mount Everest. The story of Notebook takes us through turn after turn of clich√© and improbability, ending in (for those who have not timely walked out or switched off) twist-my-arm sentimentality. I never have much defense against a good tearjerker, but this film left my eyes dry. Worse: it left me angry at the attempt at invading my emotions with such third rate movie drivel.",1.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
The Notebook Review,"This movie directed by Nick Cassavetes was taken from the novel ""The Notebook"" written by Nicolas spark .This is a romantic drama film. Ryan Gosling was, as always was awesome in his portrayal of Noah,a poor working class guy who falls in love with Allie , a beautiful rich girl . Their relationship not well received by Allie's parents which leads to separation of couple forcibly . Noah worked for military during world war . He lost his friend in war. Noah wrote one letter a day for one year to Allie war which were not dispatched to Allie by her mother.He rebuilt the old house to fulfill the desire of Allie. Both of these instances shows how much he loved the Allie. Allie got engaged with someone. When she watched Noah's photo in newspaper she felt divided between Lon and Noah . She couldn't resist her love to Noah . Atlast, couple was reunited. The story is deep and bittersweet, but ultimately rewarding. The screenplay and lines are wonderful and the director Nick Cassavetes succeeds in making a movie that makes you feel different emotions. heartwarming and heartbreaking feelings .",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Extremely good!,"Genuinely one of the best romantic dramas ive ever seen. Ive heard much about this film so i finally decided to watch it.Ive not usually a big fan of romantic films. I thinj most of them are just very exaggerated.""The Notebook"" is truly a very smart, clever and realistic piece of work. It's extremely well performed by the actors and the manuscript is very well written. It's extremely well put together and the story is very well thought out.The end is very sad and those rare moments that actually feels authentic and devastating in film.I truly recommend this great film!

The most manipulative melodramatic P.O.S. since THE PASSION,"Zero stars . . .Okay, I too saw THE NOTEBOOK at the Seattle Film Festival,and while I heard the sniveling, I have to say this was the most manipulative piece of sh** I've probably ever seen . . . and I've watched independent and mainstream stuff for over 20 years. In fact, I've been to chiropractors who haven't manipulated me as much as this film tried to do.First off, the dialogue is as original as a romance novel - trite and insipid. Second, the main characters get what they want in a very easy manner . . . dream houses virtually build themselves . . . war injuries appear most conveniently while adding atmospheric melodrama . . . everybody is so Hollywood gorgeous regardless of the circumstances and can spout cute non-sequitors endlessly as the tearducts warrant. The film just screams ""LOVE ME . . . LOVE ME !!! . . . and check out the cute outfits I'm wearing in each scene . . . ""And this is just the young romance part of the film. Cut now to 50 years later wherein Altzheimers ravages one of the protagonists, and now you get to the REALLY sappy heart of the story. She can't remember ANYTHING about their love life or family, and James Garner courageously reads their love story to her on a daily . . . I said DAILY basis. . . .while candle-lit, 4-star dinners miraculously appear courtesy of the ultra-nurturing nursing staff of the Altzheimer facility. What is their hope . . . that this 70 or 80-something couple will get it on one last time?? Folks, I've just helped an aged auntie get ""managed care"" from a nursing home who couldn't care less whether she lived or died from her heart surgery. Am I expected to believe an aged care facility cares whether or not she gets romantically connected and laid??????????????God, this is so trite and manipulative, I cannot continue with my complaints..Yes, those wanting a Hollywood manipulative empty, cry-baby experience will get everything they want from this film - IF they haven't seen Ali McGraw in LOVE STORY or BRIAN'S SONG, neither of which are a better film - they're just older, exploitative films. And what really irks this film lover is that THE NOTEBOOK will most probably gross a truck-load of $$, while lesser-known foreign and independent films dealing with this subject matter in a more human, less manipulative fashion fall off the face of the earth.",,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Don't call it a 'chick flick',"Version I saw: UK DVD releaseActors: 6/10Plot/script: 5/10Photography/visual style: 6/10Music/score: 7/10Overall: 6/10I don't believe in 'chick flicks'. I find the term incredibly patronising to women. I believe that a good movie can appeal to anyone, and a bad film should not be just excused.On the face of it, though, The Notebook is exactly the kind of film to which people might apply the label. It's a period romance, based on a book by the formulaic author Nicholas Sparks. Ryan Gosling is the main character Noah, a laconic salt-of-the-earth manual labourer type, and Rachel McAdams is the girl from the upper classes of the American south, with whom he falls in love. The story, set in the 1930s and 40s, also has a framing device in the modern day, featuring the two of them as pensioners in a retirement home, played by Gena Rowlands and James Garner.The performances are all decent or better, although McAdams was a tad too smiley for me, slightly undermining the worst of her misfortunes. In particular, Gosling is very good at the strong but silent character, internalizing his emotions so he seems dumb to the other characters, while still making his feelings clear to the audience.The whole is far from perfect - the filming is capable but largely mediocre, the portrayal of dementia is fundamentally different to that experienced by real elderly people, and when it comes down to it, it is all so clich√©d that it ends up totally predictable, sapping some of the drama - but one must be wary of being over-critical. Despite what I said above, I found myself looking for reasons not to like The Notebook, because it felt like the kind of film I should not like, as a bloke.There is actually a fair amount to like. As I said, the acting is all solid, McAdams and Gosling make a nice couple I can root for, and the clich√©s are at least arranged and assembled in a seamless way with good narrative flow. There are even a couple of really nice photographic touches: the opening sequence has lovely art direction, and there are some World War II scenes that are handsomely mounted. The setting also provides a welcome opportunity for some great swing jazz.The fact is that I enjoyed it, in an unchallenging, easy-watching kind of way. What's wrong with that?",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

Lovely Love story,"If you are a die hard fan of love stories then you may like 2004 'The Notebook', pretty love story between an obsessed middle class boy Noah and a modern city girl Allie, for Noah his world is nothing but Allie, he does anything for her, even she likes him, both seems to be crazy couples, they love each other as if they had forgotten the entire world, but their love continues until the opposition arises by Allie's parents and the couple end with break up, Allie is forcefully moved to New York far away from her love Noah, Now Noah becomes obsessed and besotted, he write her for 360 days and feel disappointed without her replay, but the reality is that the letters of Noah were deprived to Allie by her mother, initially Noah get tuned to his life, joins army and have a settled life, but still holds on his love for Allie, but in other side Allie seems to move with the situational flow, she finds her new love with an young lawyer named Lon Hammond, but in other side Noah, reconstruct his dream house in the memory of his love Allie, the news of his work comes to Allie's knowledge by some newspaper, from here the conflict rises in her mind between Noah and Lon, who do she select is the rest of the story, the narration is good, and the highlight of this super love story is the intensely cinematographic scenes, especially the beginning boating scene and the situation where Noah takes Allie to the lake filled with swans were great, overall fine and neat love story.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Overrated,"The only thing good about this movie was the beautiful scenery. The acting was decent but I'll probably only be able to view Rachel McAdams as a popular and mean high school girl. The story was predictable and boring. I thought Allie was a superficial slut and didn't have any chemistry with Noah. Their relationship was based on looks and sexual desire. I didn't see them have a true conversation once in the movie. Not only that, but when Allie was engaged she actually went and had sex with Noah. That, to me, would seem like it would make her fianc√© angry, but he didn't even care. The ending was disappointing, especially in comparison to the novel's, even though I didn't enjoy the novel either. It's one of the most overrated romances I have ever seen. I think I probably expected a masterpiece, and what I got was complete boredom. I would think twice before watching this movie.",2.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

Growing up in love,"The plots of the notebook notebook are twists and turns, and the emotions expressed are sincerely touching.

Some people always say that the past should not be remembered, and let it stay in the memories. Then the banner of this miss, sentimental everywhere. This movie makes up for our regrets in love to some extent, telling us this truth: When we work hard to love each other and fulfill our promises, why can't we be together? Dear Ellie, I had trouble sleeping last night because I knew it was over between us and I no longer suffer because I knew that there was true love between us.

While watching this movie, it is almost like you fall into it, you forget that you are living in the real world, and you feel like you are a part of these people's lives, you feel as if you are Alli and Noah.

"A beautiful, tear-jerking romance.","First off I am a girl and before we go getting stereotypical and sexist I too love all those action-packed thrills, complicated plot twists and dramatic narratives that films, unlike 'The Notebook', will provide you with, so I can appreciate a good movie. However if a tear-jerking Romantic movie comes along I will watch it and thoroughly enjoy it.And a tear-jerking movie this is. The Notebook is the only film that has left me sobbing at the screen. It is both uplifting and imposing.The plot is honestly beautiful and although this is a romantic film there is something very special about it, something that cannot be expressed through this review, you NEED to go and watch this film to understand it's uniqueness.My only criticism is that I would've liked to have seen more of the historical context behind the film, but I guess the genre doesn't allow it so I can't really complain.I dare you not to feel any sort of emotion for this film. Definitely in my top ten films to watch.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
What a story,"A true heart wrenched. Most love stories skip over certain aspects that are brought on in the notebook, and I think it makes it so hard to watch because of how real this can be. Rachel McAdam's acting was amazing as she carried the film on her shoulders. She shined so brightly as she took on the role of Ally. The film fell short with Ryan Gosling. Yes he was beautiful and he knew how to have a fun time, but he was so serious and intense half the time with those droopy sad eyes, that just made you forget he was there.The filming of the notebook and the cinematography was amazing. The director did such a good job at drawing in the viewer and making you fall in love with the love story.

Brutal,"I am a man who typically stays away from romantic films, but I don't object to watching one on occasion. After hearing good things about The Notebook from some friends of mine, I decided that, having nothing better to do, I'd see what the stir was about. Big mistake.The Notebook is the weakest, blandest and most painfully boring drama/romance I have seen in ages. There is nothing interesting about the plot whatsoever, and the ending of the film made itself apparent right from the start. Expecting warm characters, good acting and a fun storyline, I was extremely disappointed. Instead of portraying the experience of falling in love as being the truly magical thing it is, this movie makes it seem dry, tasteless and liable to put people to sleep.Thankfully I watched the film on DVD, so I had the fast-forward button readily available for the boring, wide sweeping 'romantic' scenes. If you are looking for a truly moving romantic film, I suggest Love Actually. Don't waste your time with The Notebook.",3.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
It was fantastic,"This movie lived up to all my expectations and absolutely earned the 4/5 stars that most critics gave it.

Cheers",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Summary,"OK I am a guy and I absolutely loved this movie. I have never even met a person who just said this movie plain out sucked, because it is so genuine and amazing. The Notebook is the one romance I will actually gladly sit through. I sort of saw it with my sisters and mother as a young boy, but only remember the ""barn scene"", which happened due to natural reasons. However, after my friend convinced me to see this I was elated that I did. The movie is the perfect resemblance of young and first love, it is genuine and something incredibly special. Most summer romance are intimate, hot, exciting, and gleeful, however, they always lack enough time. I myself had a romance like this and many other have as well. It is a beautiful time, the sun is shining people are smiling and you're feeling in the moment. The Notebook is the perfect resemblance of what everyone once felt enjoying their summer romances. The effect of Allie's and Noah's rendezvous is incredible. Event hough, most people will not continue these summer romances or even see those people they have a special place in our hearts. Noah and Allie were the perfect actors, this movie pushed their careers into the great state they are in currently, which is especially true for Ryan Gosling. One of the reasons why Gosling's and McAdams's love explodes off the screen is because of their actual relationship outside of the movie. The vintage scenes with the cars, cinema, WWII, etc.. make this movie for me even a little bit better. It happens today, as well, but back then relationships were based on romance and pure craziness about two people, today it seems to be all about the sexual pleasures. The intermitting scenes with the old people house and Noah's and Allie's young lives build a beautiful connection and the last few scenes with lines such as, ""Our love can do miracles"", and ""I'll be seeing you"" are the first time since the Lion King and the Pokemon movie as a little kid that I almost cried. The Notebook is not the best movie ever because the acting wasn't Inception, Batman, or Shawshank Redemption like. However, this is the most genuine movie I have ever seen. Even as a guy living in a sex oriented world, I appreciate true love and long for such moments and connection as Allie and Noah shared. It also does not have the same story line as every chick-flick, but has something special to it. The Notebook is a wonderful movie, the best of its kind.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
This will become a classic love story.,"This will become a classic love story. My wife and I watched it together and it confirmed that we are where we are supposed to be. I truly believe that relationships like the one portrayed in the movie exist today but are not celebrated. We mostly only get to see the negative aspects with being involved in one. Too many times people just settle for something that might be safe or more accepted by others. I think this more often then not leads to regrets. Much like the one that was stated by Ali's mother towards the end of the movie. Total commitment to each other is what it takes to make a close and real relationship work and I think that was shown. Was this a movie that ""moved"" me? Absolutely! Great movie!",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

I honestly didn't like Rayan Goseling play I would say he could've done better, but I ve enjoyed everything else the pictures the soundtrack and the way I felt when I was watching it, made me happy when it's happy and I was crying when it was sad, I really loved it till the end.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

After all, in the end, their life did not end the way they would have liked. And it's a pity that a person can forget what he experienced when this past is so touching and beautiful. I really liked Rachel McAdams. I've never really liked her, but here I just can't take my eyes off her.

Very painful reminder for me.,"Im 34, as i type, never had a girlfriend. My first kiss took her own life. Not sure why. Every case of ""love"" was unrequited, or the girl lived far away or bad timing and she was with somebody else. I gave up on it. It's too painful to try. Im not where i want to be in life, right now. I dont know where to look. People from that generation had simple lives. Not many distractions like today. They're lucky. Many grandparents were like these 2. Doesnt matter what race or whatever, very similar to a lot of people. I think of my grandfather who was married to my grandmother for 65 years until she died unexpectedly in hip surgery. He'll be 95 in april.I watch this film, Pearl Harbor, I see men who are legendary and just better than me. I'll never be like them. I dont know what's missing. Will i ever have the ""love"" Allie and Noah had? I dont know. At 34, it doesnt even seem close. But people die virgins, they die as children from cancer, some die in war having never dated a girl. Still, I feel like i'm different when i watch movies like this. It's very painful to watch. I was crying so hard!I've only watched this film 3 times in my life, as i type. 2004, when it was in cinema, 12 years ago, randomly on tv, and Today. I even have the DVD! It's UNOPENED! Wrapping still on it. I can't watch this film. It was on, and i felt it harmless, so i set the channel. And BAM! Im crying so hard! I dont cry very much. Movies that make me cry: Forrest Gump, The Butterfly Effect, Benjamin Button, LIFE(1999 same director as this film) and THE NOTEBOOK! Those films always make me cry! I think Life, Forrest Gump and the Notebook make me cry the hardest!It's easy for me to fall in love with Rachel Mcadams. She was so beautiful and great acting. In 2004, The girl i loved was Lucy Hale. Lucy was in my church Youth Group. I didnt know who she was. Just that she was cute and very nice to me. I had a crush on her. She seemed to think i was a cool older boy type(only 2 years older than her) and seemed interested in me. But wow! My mom was still driving me and i was 17! How can i even think of dating Lucy Hale when my mom still drives me?! Lol. Every time that summer 2004, my mom would drop me off, lucy was at the entrance seeing it and probably thinking i wasnt so cool. But i also just spent 14 months at Fork Union Military Academy and was awkward with girls. Still, lucy was the girl i thought about when i watched this in 2004! Lol. I think She moved from memphis to Los Angeles shortly after that summer. So, i hadnt seen her until jan 2010, randomly at whole foods where she gave me a hug and asked how i was. I last saw her dec 2017, i looked in her eyes, talking to her at baggage claim, and her eyes seemed the same as 2004. She's a nice girl. But the sadness i feel when watching this film isn't about My heavy feelings for her in 2004. It's the concept of love and how it seems daunting/fleeting/hopeless. I dont love Lucy hale. That night after watching, i DID cry really hard in my bedroom thinking of Lucy. She was a nice girl, still is, great actor, too. But i dont know if i'll ever find love at all, let alone like the kind i saw in this film.I rated this film 10 stars because it's not just a love story, it's a great concept and WOW! It's something to maybe hope for. Look forward to. Even when the mom told her story, i cried a little in the pasta i made. Gross. Life is crazy. For me, it's best that i dont even think about love or watch movies like this. I can't do it. I'm not strong enough to fight for it like they did. Like noah did. Wow! He was so addicted to her that he kept fighting for those few minutes every year or month or whatever when ""ALLIE""
Would come back and remember him. What a sweet thing to look forward to and fight for! Wow! Maybe One day Chris Wade will also find love. Lol. Also! WOW! Rachel McAdams has a beautiful naked body.

This movie was so romantic!,"I am going on a relationship of one and a half years at this time. My loving boyfriend took me to see The Notebook. I knew it was true love when he sat through the entire movie with me while I was crying. I, obviously, had to see it again so I took my best friend and she loved it. I went to see it one more time with my mom who also cried through the entire thing. I can't wait until it comes out so that I can buy this movie! If you haven't seen it yet don't hesitate it is such a wonderful love story. It makes me think of my grandma and how her love life was when she was young. And it also makes me think of how I will look back when I am older and see how much I was in love and even more so then. And when you watch it make sure to have your man sit with you with a box of tissues.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Beautiful movie,"The Notebook is a beautiful story and a well-executed movie. It is definitely inspired by Romeo and Juliet, but it's so much better than the adaptations of the Shakespeare drama.The characters are very well-crafted, but they make some decisions, that are unreasonable. These served the story, but I think the story should serve the characters, which is why I don't think this movie is near perfect. The story is extremely emotional, but at the same time predictable.The cinematography was outstanding in some scenes, but mostly just good. I didn't find anything more that was exceptional from the technical part.Overall this movie is really beautiful, but there are a few mistakes that prevent it from being and absolute classic.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Good film,"Good film. The typical romance between the classes becomes strained and it becomes apparent that the relationship may not work out. Gosling does not fret though as he swears to write to McAdams everyday. As time passes, the U. S. involvement in World War II forces Gosling and best friend Kevin Connolly (a real scene stealer) to go to Europe to fight for Patton's Allied Forces. Meanwhile McAdams volunteers as a nurse in New York while attending school and instantly injured army man James Marsden falls in love with her. A short courtship, and the fact that he is from a wealthy southern family that her parents approve of, endears him to McAdams. She also falls in love with him, finally putting the hurt of her time with Gosling behind her (she never knows that Gosling's letters are intercepted by Allen). Gosling returns from war and his loving father (a fine turn by the excellent Sam Shepard) has sold his home so Gosling can buy and fix up an old dilapidated house from the area. Gosling's promise to McAdams to repair the old mansion during their summer fling drives him to brilliant work, but self-destructive emotional tendencies. He drinks uncontrollably, sheds himself from others and has a loveless physical relationship with young war widow Jamie Brown (in a well-timed and very convincing role). A crazy twist of fate then leads McAdams back to North Carolina.8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

Unbelievably inspirational,"For the most part, I like suspense/thrillers, mainly because love stories sometimes lack originality. The notebook will inspire all those who believe in true love. If some men could only learn not to conform to society and be in touch with their true beings without fear of disapproval, there would be many more potential husbands. Noah, the main actor is indisputably the most convincing actor I have ever seen. He delivers an example that should be followed by other men.

The best love story ever told,"I've never written a review on this wonderful movie in spite of how many times I've seen it, and how I feel about it. Now I'm not going to speak on acting, or narratives or any of the the other things experts speak about , because to me for this particular movie all I can see & feel is true love. Ite is probably the best love story I have ever seen Jack & Rose ain't got nothing on these two. And I think this had to have touched the heart of every woman , girl big & small. It's the love, the dream all woman dream of when were young. And it never falters. The fact that he I guess Noah, comes from the other side of the tracks proves that a woman in love knows no tracks, no boundaries. Being kept apart basically from kis and having years go by Thier hearts still being filled with one another is a love as it should be. Course time interferes nd life must go on. Allie has no other choice but to move on and live her life. Noh continues to keep her so close in his heart despite maybe a couple of lady distractions. He remembers how Allie wanted that house built, and he did I for her, never knowing he'd ever see her again. And one could tell at the result it was is love for Allie hat he built it so beautifully. Meanwhile Allie mat a wonderful wealthy man who her parents adord, nd she loved him. Nothing like Noah, but she loved the life she had, the people with whom she associated and all the niceties that come with being on the right side of he tracks. She lived putting Noah behind as best she could, but he was always there buried deep inside her heart. Till the day before her wedding there it was, he photo of that gorgeous house with her Noah standing beside it. She then realized what she knew all along. And he had a part of her in the house he built for her. She gave herself an excuse to go see him because of that house and at that moment although she became frightened and ran. All the love they had always hd was still there as though time had stood still. She admitted to herself, her family that her heart belonged to hat scruffy cute as hell guy that stole her heart many years ago. Noah told her if it's him you want want,? Go. But we're not over. Not by a long sho. She cried tears of happiness n sadness , as she went back and told her fiance the truth. And there she was bags packed outside that beautiful home looking up at the one true love of her life. .

But of course who could forget Gena Rowlands and James Garner who were so great and very touching in there portrays of the older Ally and Noah so heartbreaking!I would definitely recommend this movie to anybody who believes in love at first sight,soulmates,everlasting love.Thank you Nicholas Sparks and Nick Cassavetes for writing and directing such a beautiful love story!!!!",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
The Notebook,"One of the most romantic movies I've ever watched. You can feel and see how their love develops and repairs itself. This movie proves that if you've truly loved someone once you'll love them forever, no matter the situation, no matter their form or condition. Both actors really did play their roles well, making their connection incredibly realistic which is a rare thing in such movies. The way they tell the story is smooth, at first you think that there are two parallel stories but in the end they merge together. This movie captures love beautifully and shows how powerful it can really be.Overall I recommend to watch this movie at least once, it can teach you a thing or two.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Good,This is a good movie. It is predictable but is better than something you will see on Lifetime network. The pairing of Gosling and McAdams is simply chemistry in a bottle. This makes the movie something more than it should be. I'm glad to see directors/writers/producers who understand that you just can't say two people are in love but that you need to give them dialogue and a foundation for their love. This is where the movie Pearl Harbor failed and this movie succeeds.The movie is bookended by veteran actors Garner and Rowlands who are superb.These are clearly breakout roles for McAdams who also had success in Mean Girls and especially for Gosling.8/10,8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

How Love Should Be,"""The best love is the kind that awakens the soul and makes us reach for more, that plants a fire in our hearts and brings peace to our minds.""Lately, my Pinterest feed was filled with images of this movie.Knowing what it was about less then vaguely, I assumed I would be more then suitable for a cinematic evening.Watching it, I found myself wondering how the film was received by critics. I assumed, without necessarily adhering to that particular point of view, that I might have been discredited by the majority as being a sentimental romantic drama.However, I realized that this should not be remotely important. I found myself quite attached to the movie, its characters, its drama.How can you not be, with such charismatic leads who simply delight us with their radiance ? That inspire us to lead a romantic love of such splendid nature ?Damn, who wouldn't like to have that lasting, powerful love ?It's ending is striking as it's heartwrenching but offers a marvellous conclusion.Furthermore, as a side note, I think the short showing of the Battle of the Bulge was really well done.As was the film as a whole.

I sat down expecting a crappy movie and then got up at the end crying my heart out and thinking over and over that this was one of my favorite movies ever.

Whenever there's a movie about a bestseller, the reader is almost always disappointed (it happened to me with Message in a Bottle).

"Beautiful, Beautiful Love Story","Films seldom make me cry, but this one sure did.This has to be one of the most beautiful love stories I have ever seen on film.The photography is also quite beautiful with the lakes and the moonlight on the water and the birds flying.I wish men really did love women this much, but I've never seen any evidence that they do. Nonetheless the characters, and their story grabbed me from the start.The film opens with an older man, James Garner, reading a story to an older woman, the still beautiful, Gena Rowlands, at a nursing home.We then move back into the 1940's and meet Noah and Allie, the young couple in the story, who first encounter one another at a carnival. Noah is instantly and completely smitten with Allie, but she takes a bit more convincing regarding him.Eventually, however, they are both wildly in love with one another - but there are complications. Allie comes from upper crust people, Noah does not.It seems they are destined to be parted. Allie meets another wonderful young man, Lon, while she does some nursing during WWII, while Noah loses himself in the renovation of a beautiful, old, ruined plantation house. I fell in love with that house almost as much as I did with the characters and the story.Will they cross one another's paths again, and what might be the consequences if they do? The answer to this plays out in a highly interesting way and ties in with the two older people we meet at the beginning of the film, in an unexpected and heartbreaking way.Allie is fetchingly played by the very pretty Rachel McAdams, and Noah is portrayed quite sensitively by Ryan Gosling. Ryan Gosling, whom I had never seen before, as far as I know, reminded me quite a lot of Adrian Brody - another fine actor who is excellent at playing sensitive types.This is an exceptional film of depth and beauty.10 stars out of 10 stars.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

Dire,"Ryan Gosling is far too good an actor for this mawkish rubbish about young love and old love and eternal love. I knew things were bad when I started admiring the ducks on the lake. Gosling is the boy from the wrong side of the tracks who has a summer romance with rich girl Rachel McAdams, (who has the kind of face you are unlikely to remember from one movie to the next). They lose each other and just as predictably find each other again and all the time nice old codger James Garner tells the story of their 'great' love to Gena Rowlands who has senile dementia. No brownie points for filling in the gaps.Rowlands is sensational considering she doesn't have anything to do but look vacant and Joan Allen is simply brilliant as McAdams' rich bitch of a mother. The fact that Allen is one of the best actresses in America helps. She can rise above the most mediocre of material and this is truly mediocre; appallingly scripted, indifferently directed and if a few members of the cast are giving it more than it's worth, they can still hardly be said to be redeeming the material.",2.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Stunning Movie,"I've seen The Notebook quite s few times and though it is the pure definition of a sappy love film, it draws me in with it's story every time.

Though reality's story can never be as compelling as Noah (Ryan Gossling) and Allie's (Rachel McAdams), one can only dream. The actors in this particular film did an outstanding job at portraying the Southern classes in that specific time period and in creating an immense chemistry between the two characters.

The Movie of 2011 without a doubt. Lovely and very tender.,"I can truly relate to this movie as both my parents suffered from Alzheimers disease. My dad has passed away but my mum is in a nursing home. She has bouts of remembering who I am and at other times she does not know. It is a story that everyone should watch, as it can bring most people to tears. It is so full of emotion, and heartbreak for everyone that was in close contact with Ellie. I have the DVD and I can watch over and over. It is such a debilitating disease that it has such an emotional impact on close ones, and this is highlighted so clearly by the husband and the dramatic changes by his wife. I admired and appalled him for the support,love and understanding at the most difficult times that he gave to his wife. The fact that he never gave up and her and cared for her right to the final end. It is so true when you say your wedding vows, till death do us depart. I thing this movie deserves recognition in the fact that he showed how the disease can affect the human mind, it is uncontrollable,degrading at times and so heart wrenching for all involved in the process of loss of memory. In fact most people go through the grieving stage during the various stage of the disease and not after the person passing away. I have such vivid memories of this movie unlike any other movie that I have seen and forgotten after a certain period of time. I love this movie and will keep watching until my memory fades, which is a strong possibility as the disease runs in both sides of the family.

"Emotional Rollercoaster of a film, but definitely worth the watch.","The Notebook is a film about a sloppy summer romance that engulfs our two main characters, Allie (Rachel McAdams), and Noah (Ryan Gosling). After they are torn apart by Allies parents as well as different life paths, it's a fight to get back to each other after years apart as well as new romances.
The theme of this movie is that loves truly does conquer all. It is seen several times by the main characters as they get reacquainted after yeas apart, and somehow still find that they never fell out of love with each other. It is shown in several scenes that regardless of how much our characters fight, they never lost feelings for each other. For example in the famous argument scene where our characters are standing outside of Allies car in front of the house. They are both arguing over whether or not they are going to be together when Noah points out that, that is their dynamic. They fight but in the end they always love each other, proving the point at love conquers all. Throughout the entire film you can feel the emotional connection between the characters even when they are apart, similar to the movie Dear John (2010), another film based on the books by Nicholas Sparks.
What makes this movie extraordinary is the emotional connection and tension you can feel in he film through the use of things such as lighting and angle. In scenes such as the montage of Noah and Allie spending time together in the beginning of the film, the lightning used is a light colorful array, signifying that they are both happy and carefree as they fall helplessly in love with each other. In other scenes, such as the ones taking place in the nursing home and the final scenes of the movie, they use low key lightning in a way to make the scenes more dramatic. The angles help play an important role as well as they create personal and intimate moments between the actors and the viewers. As the camera pans from Noah to Allie, to a wide shot that captures them both, you really feel like you are there with them, watching it all unfold. The director has a way of really pulling out the emotions of the viewers as the characters go through several ups and down of the relationship but eventually figure out that in the end, love does conquer all.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Brought to tears,"After watching this movie last night, I was literally sobbing. I don't fall easily into girlie movies, yet this one for some reason went right to my heart. I was 17 once, full of fire and emotions. I was exactly the type that would lay in the street and watch stop lights, just because of the fact that no one else does it. There is no reason for it, except that you are young. I got that part. What touched me the most was the love between the older Noha and Allie, and they are the ones that brought me to tears. To me, the story seems like it didn't have to be anymore than it was, it was supposed to be a story about someone's lives, the story of their life, and to them, it was important enough, it was special enough that they would do anything to relive it.. It was a story of young love, maturity, and true love that never dies. In my opinion, acted out very well by all. I loved all the characters in this movie. It made me wish I was there too.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Good romance film,"Good romance film. I was also not very familiar with Rachel McAdams...but wow! She's tremendous as the young seventeen year old girl! I never cared much for James Garner...oh, an occasional role here and there. In this film he was charming, and perfect for the role as the story teller. But...I did have a little difficulty seeing him as the old Ryan Gosling...physically I can see no resemblance whatsoever. That was distracting. I have never seen Gena Rowlands (as the old lady) more beautiful and poignant. Joan Allen is, in my view, a much underrated actress, and I wish we saw much more of her. More and more I see James Marsden as a dependable ""sleeper"" of an actor whom I respect. The one real casting error, from my perspective, was David Thornton, whom I just can't see as the father of the young lady.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Amazing film!!,"I absolutely loved The Notebook. It is possibly the best love story I have ever seen!! I think a great film is one that makes you think about it after you have finished watching it, one that you can watch many times and never find boring and one where you wish you were in the film or that your life was like that! And I think The Notebook has all these great features. The chemistry between Noah (Ryan Gosling) and Allie (Rachel McAdams) is amazing. I still find myself crying when it has finished and i've now watched it about ten times!! No other film has yet done that to me! Each scene is done fantastically and when it has finished you just want to start it all over again. If you haven't already watched this film, then believe me you are missing out!

"Monotonous, but inspiring.","To be honest, this movie is monotonous. My friend recommends to me, saying this is the nice love story. I am into the movie recently, let me check it out, I did not almost expect it before watching it. It was correct, 70% correct. But rest of 30% it was wrong. I admit it was tedious, which means I feel like being manipulated within director's hands. It could not help Allie gave up with Lon because her mother, who also suffered from in the past in terms of marriage concealed letters from Noa. But it does not justify her action, right? It applies to Noa. I feel for him, but Martha was abandoned for their sake without describing that in detail. That point does not make sense.I wanted to see psychological description of them. It was operated. It was not carnivalesque,On the other hand, something bursts in me when I associate it with my life, in which I regret it in many points. It gave me many thoughts. It encouraged me. I had no choice but to feel empathy for it.Overall it was not bad in that I recall myself. In that sense, this movie was successful, though there are a lot of improvements.

"If you're a bird, I'm a bird","As I'm a romantic person, I have seen a lot of romantic dramas and The Notebook has a very special resonance within me.There are so many romantic movies in the market which feel redundant and not particularly bringing memorable souvenirs. But the Notebook is one of those films which is touching your deep soul because its story reflects what true, real love is and it can trump everything.The Notebook tells the story of Noah and Ellie, two sweet souls who comes from entirely different worlds. He is a poor blue collar worker who lives in a small South Carolina town. She is a rich heiress from Charleston. They were never meant to be a couple but they fall in love and founded an amazing family despite the odds and their social ranks differences. Their story is told through an old man in an hospice in our nowadays era who is reading his own notebook to a fellow female resident struggling with dementia. It turns out that the old man is Noah, the female resident is Ellie and he is actually recounting their own love story so she could remember how much in love they are. They have 3 children and two grandchildren.It's not the first time the theme of two people crazily loving each other despite their social ranks is used to make a movie but I felt transported by the grace of the actors and the feel good sensation transpiring from this sweet couple Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams are forming. I could feel they shared some complicity even if I found out they were not very friendly to each other during the shooting but at the end they made it work.There is no wonder this movie achieved a huge success and if you have the romantic fiber as I do, you will certainly cry especially at the end.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Hit the feels this one does still certainly do,"Touching!Despite evidently not watching this until today, I've always heard about the sad tag that many associate with 'The Notebook' - and I can see why. Given I didn't know anything other than that, I was not anticipating how the film portrays its story - which is effective and rather heartbreaking. I'm not one to get properly emotional to movies, though hit the feels this one does still certainly do.The film features impressive performances from Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams, as well as James Garner and Gena Rowlands. In smaller roles, Joan Allen and James Marsden are relatively solid too. If I had to nitpick, which it would very much be, I would've shortened the run time ever so slightly; could've been wrapped up quicker, but no biggie.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

Main actors did not feel like they were southerners from 1950,"I am sorry, but this is another movie that I thought the actors used for the main characters were inappropriate; they did not bring across the feeling they grew up in the south in the 50s. If one grew up in the south in the 1950s there would be a certain speech, and dignity that I felt not one of the main characters brought across. If they were going to use these actors, they should have put it in a different location, which, also, would have changes a lot more. Now the supporting actors/actress all were very good, at least I felt they were southerners. I also felt the story was a bit contrived, but the proper actors probably could have pulled it off.",3.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Too cheesy and unrealistic,"I like Rachel McAdams and Joan Allen. They acted well here but could not save the bland and contrived plot and the awkwardness and cheese oozing out of Ryan Gosling, as a prime example of the unbearable characterization with which the movie's 2nd half is filled. (the 1st half till they broke up at summer is pretty watchable). As Allie turned to leave Noah's house after her mother's visit and Noah broke out in a rage while reciting superfluous dialogue with a stiff palm on his chest, I just could not watch his performance for a second more (good thing there wasn't any more of it)! How on earth does a man sound so justified at getting mad at a woman leaving him, necessarily and potentially temporarily to sort out a melodramatic mess because she's engaged to someone else? Here's a loser who spent all his life missing a girl without any other ostensible ideals or goal in life (given I didn't read the book), and whose morals and maturity, assumed to be sound by default owing to an upbringing of stereotypical paternal love and wisdom, are now collapsing into a heap. Other parts that made me laugh/cringe include widow on the verge of going back to loneliness, her place taken by a prettier and richer girl, experiencing sublime feelings of love and hope, cheesy teary old Noah, and Joan Allen's sudden hysterics of ""I love your father"". So every rich girl needs a poor boy and then gets split for romance? I always thought the American depiction of love and human nature is much more true to life, but it seems traditions are traditions, from the Qiong Yao and Korean dramas to America in the 40s, lol. For Rachel McAdams I would give it a 6; a 5 for the over-ratedness and complete lack of empathy in characterization.",1.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Noah And Allie Bridging The Years,"James Garner and Gena Rowlands and Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdam pay the same pair of lovers during the World War II years and up to the present day. All four of them and the cast assembled by director Nick Cassavetes present a wonderful romantic film that will bridge the generations.We meet Noah and Allie in their old age at first. We see their story later unfold, but we learn that while they may have lived happily it was not ever after as old phrase goes.Old age is a time of memories and if you're lucky enough to find your soulmate they will be shared memories. And that's half the enjoyment of memories, someone to remember the shared experience with.But when one of the partners develops Alzheimer's it's devastating for the one who doesn't have it to watch the other deteriorate. And that's what's happening with Garner as he visits Rowlands in a nursing home.On this visit he's prepared though. Garner has brought a notebook in which he's written down their story. The nurse introduces him as a stranger who takes her outside and proceeds to read their story as though this happened to two other people in an attempt to reach Rowlands.And in flashback we see their story and as Gosling and McAdams we see the ups and downs of a poor boy/rich girl romance. That makes up the bulk of the film. Gosling and McAdams are most definitely each other's soulmates, but her parents do their best to keep them apart and both get involved with other people, Jamie Anne Allman and James Marsden.The sad message is that even for the most right of couples, there's no such thing as happily FOREVER after at least on this Earth. I've had several two aunts with Alzheimer's disease and I could relate to what Garner was going through with Rowlands. And I have aunt right now who is 89 and in my last conversation with her I could see her memory going and how that must be affecting my uncle who is the same age.The four leads and the rest of the cast are just perfect in their parts. Director Nick Cassavetes is of course directing his mother here and you know they were completely in sync. I cannot believe The Notebook got no Oscar nominations at all, it's a travesty how it was overlooked by the Academy. It did get several awards and nominations from other venues, but not from the Academy.The Notebook is a perfect romantic story and the nature of it will appeal to all the generations we have living on the planet.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Movies like this make me sick,"This is one of those exploitation pieces geared at your heart strings. For the entire film this movie's plot tugs at the viewers heartstrings. It'd be moving if it wasn't so obvious! Without being too negative, I'll say that Rachel McAdams is a stand out! And the fact that she didn't get nominated for an Oscar let alone win is a complete tell. That for me completely rings home the tune that art is subjective and how can you compare it. Not that you cant criticize it. Which I'm about to do.The Notebook is crap.A film about a notebook was always going to be a gamble. And I must say it didn't pay off. But how could it? A two hour film about a notebook? Seriously what next. A 3 hour film about a phone book? But can I just reiterate that Rachel McAdams is the most attractive looking thing I've seen on film since Katharine Ross in The Graduate. But seriously tho, the make up people need to paint some eye brows on her. What a weird looking thing, reminds me of some kind of DNA gene botch up albino monster!",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

Romance never dies,"If it is depicted as it is in this movie, anyway. A movie, that makes you fall in love with Rachel McAdams (or maybe her male counterpart, depending on your orientation), a movie that actually convinces in it's romantic roots, which sadly can't be said about many movies. Then again, this is based on a novel, which I unfortunately haven't read yet and which could mean the difference.The complex storyline has us staying with two characters (James Garner and Gena Rowlands are genuinely fantastic and the center piece/gravitas of the movie), while we listen to a story that is being told. While that means, we have a few characters that we have to follow and different stories that we have to stay on focus with, we never lose touch with any of them. Which is a great achievement of the book (I guess), but also of the director and the cast. Although it just has it's 5th anniversary, I consider it a classic (and I don't use that term often)",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Perhaps the Greatest Love Story of Our Generation!,"As a guy, I generally try to stay away from Nicholas Sparks movies because they seem too schmaltzy and tripe for my taste. I do have a sweet spot for romance, but just not in these kind of films. Then I was forced to watch this film, The Notebook. I'm glad I did because this is the greatest love story of my generation perhaps only rivaling Titanic (please don't judge me.) This period piece also features memorable characters whom truly draw you in and I also mention this has one of the greatest film endings in cinema history and one that made the film even more remarkable. There are some clich√©s to be had, but in the end the film is just a simple love story.This film starts off in modern day at a nursing home with this elderly man named Duke reading a romance story to a female patient. This story is about how a working class man named Noah who falls in love with a girl named Allie, a girl from the elite class. Despite their social differences, they spend every day together. But they end up separating anyhow because of their different statuses. But seven years later, fate has them meeting up again but this time under different scenarios.This film is well-acted by everyone. Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams make a magnificent pair together on-screen and this movie is responsible for their stardom. There are good supporting turns by Sam Shepard as Noah's supportive father and Joan Allen as Allie's cold, stern mother. But we cannot miss the performances of the great James Garner as Duke and Gena Rowland as the female patient.Overall, Nick Cassevete directed a magnificent romance film and from what I heard, the best book-to-screen adaptation of Nicholas Sparks. This film is also realistic as it effectively shows what history was like and how social interactions changed over the past seventy years. I may have to check out more Sparks films, but I'm sure they are not even close to living up to the Notebook. And yes, I nearly cried at certain points. I rate this film 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

THE WORST,"call it predictable, sophomoric,clich√©d up the ying yang,badly scripted and the worse direction,in a film that could have been lovely.there is not a truthful moment here. everything is so forced and the end result is boring.questions to ask and remarks #1 who on earth did Gena Rolands make-up and hair? i know of no nursing home that has professional hair and make-up people on staff.this looked ludicrous.also, there was not one old person using a walker or a wheelchair. #2 David Thornton performance as Allies' father was out of a comic book along with Joan Allan as her mother. #3 the costumes were terrible.in the flash back sequences which there were plenty not one woman was wearing slips.

A flawed yet emotional romantic drama,"I'm the kind of person who just loves to read novels, but I've never been an avid romance novel reader. I mean, how many guys would be? That means, of course, that I've never read The Notebook or any of Nicholas Sparks' novels. From what I've heard, some of them are really good, while others are either over-the-top or just silly. If I had to guess, though, I'd say the movie The Notebook was adapted from a novel belonging to the former category. That, or scriptwriters Jan Sardi and Jeremy Leven are really good at what they do. In any case, there's no denying that The Notebook is a compelling motion picture, and a very emotional kind of experience. It's what many would call a ""tear-jerker"" (an accurate description, considering how emotional the film is) but, at least in this case, calling it that it not a bad thing at all.The film tells the story of Noah (James Garner as an adult, and Ryan Gosling as the younger version) and Allie. (Gene Rowlands in modern times, and Rachel McAdams during her younger years.) It's the year 2000, and Allie is suffering of dementia, something that is affecting her memory. With hopes of making her better, Noah is reading her from an old notebook, which recounts their story together; how they met, how they fell in love, and how they eventually ended up together. They met in America just before WWII; Noah was a working class teenager, while Allie belonged to a wealthy family. As most will be able to guess, their differences in terms of social classes became an issue, especially when Allie's mother (Joan Allen) found about their relationship. This lead to their break up, but fortunately for the both of them, destiny made them find each other again after the war, and just before Allie married an equally wealthy and undeniably charming soldier. (James Marsden.) If there's a reason why The Notebook worked so great for me, it's because it's so damned emotional. The story is predictable, as well the twists and turns the scriptwriters keep throwing at the audience, but the movie is presented in such a manner that it's not hard to feel for the characters and want them to end up together. Technically, it's brilliant - pre-WWII America is presented very accurately, and the film provides with such beautiful photography that it's hard not to fall in love with it. It's a beautiful-looking film, and as it's usually the case, it tells the story of two equally pretty people who just can't seem to be together. Their romance is pretty straightforward stuff - I actually thought at times it was too dramatic and that it resembled a cheap soap opera a little too much - but what made the story so compelling was the contrast between their early life and the situation in the 21st century. It may be due to my fears or to how I feel towards the topic, but the fact that Allie couldn't recognize Noah and that he just kept reading at her and loving her... OK, let's just say it's pretty powerful stuff.If there's a genre that depends a lot on performances, it's the romantic drama; if your leads don't have any chemistry between each other, if they can't sell the romance to the audience, then your movie is pretty much screwed. Fortunately, that's not the case in here. Rachel McAdams is beautiful and compelling; she turns Allie into a charming, likable kind of character, the kind of girl you just want to be happy. Ryan Gosling is equally good, although I felt at times his interpretation of Noah lacked a little characterization, a little charm. In any case, he does have chemistry which McAdams, making every encounter between them bloom with passion. As the older versions of this characters, James Garner and Jena Rowlands are really good too although, at least for me, it was hard to believe those two were the same people who appear in the flashbacks. They just don't look alike or even feel alike.Something that bothered me a little and that many critics have mentioned about the film, is that it feels a little restrained. Considering hat subject matter, and the fact that it's a very dramatic, slow-moving, emotional and occasionally sad, I don't think many teenagers would want to watch the movie. So why then the PG-13 rating? Every time Noah and Allie were involved in a sex scenes, tricky camera-work was used to make sure no nudity was shown, and the actors even are positioned in such a way that it looks forced and awkward, only to make sure, again, that they don't show any skin. If you're going to have a film that contains quite a bit of sexuality and that doesn't appeal to many underage viewers, it doesn't make any sense to restrain it. Many members of the audience won't even notice this, but it definitely bothered me.As most of my readers may have already noticed, The Notebook is flawed, but a movie doesn't have to be a flawless masterpiece in order to be enjoyable. The Notebook is a romantic drama, and in order to succeed, it only has to do a couple of things: provide with solid romantic moments, have a believable leading couple and, if possible, make its viewers cry. I can say that this film achieved all three objectives, and that if you don't cry while watching it, especially during the last few scenes, you just don't have a soul. OK, so the filmmakers might be cheating - sometimes it's almost as if Nick Cassavettes and his team were trying to throw pepper-spray at the audience in order to make them cry - but the film is presented in such an elegant, compelling fashion, that you won't notice any of its flaws until well after the end credits.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

A different love story,"The Notebook (2004) is a prequel movie based on the novel written by Nicholas Sparks. It won awards as MTV Movie Awards: Best Kiss, Teen Choice Award: The Best Movie Drama, BMI Music Film Award and some others.
The features ""A Walk to Remember"" and ""Textuality"" were inspired in this novel. Directed by Nick Cassavetes, who also directed the movies such as ""The Wraith, Blind Fury, Delta Force 3"".
The movie is about the young love of rich Allie (Rachel McAdams) and worker Noah (Ryan Gosling) from a family without financial resources. The setting is the 1940 decade in South Carolina. They meet in an Amusement park during the summer holidays and they stay desperately in love, but the young lady's parents don't approve of the dating because of their social differences. So, to avoid any approximation, her parents send her away.
For a year Noah writes to Allie every day but has no answer. Believing that Allie is no longer interested in him, Noah goes to World War II. Meanwhile Allie meets a charming officer when working in a Hospital. He served in the World War II, and belonged to a very wealthy family.

exploding clich√©,"pick a romantic movie clich√© -- you'll probably find it in The Notebook. It's unintentionally funny with it's unbelievably overly sentimental take on almost everything (including mental illness -- fun!). There is a scene that would be frightening to anyone who has ever encountered waterfowl, but instead feeding the freakish mass of white ducks is played as supremely romantic.The acting was o.k., it was really the plot and the unsustainable narrative structure that really killed the movie.This was the opening film of the Seattle International Film Festival. I'm guessing that it was selected to be completely inoffensive to corporate sponsors. As long as the big donors don't care about innovative or interesting films, the selection may have been a success.At least it provided some laughs and a very low bar for the rest of the festival (which was otherwise well programmed).",2.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Best Romantic Film!,"This movie to me anyway was the best romantic movie I have seen.It was so touching I actually had to hold back tears.I watched it a good couple times and I still don't get tired of it.The message is simple true love never dies no matter how hard you to try to move on and forget it.And even though you forget it there is someone there to remind you of it.One part of the movie that made me angry was the mother hiding the 365 letters Noah wrote to Alli.Money over love is total bull**** in the end love is triumph and I couldn't believe she put through her daughter through that pain thinking she was doing her good.Why not let her live her life make her own mistakes?Who knows she might come out happier in the end.In which she did she had a life filled with endless love.The ending was good,I felt that it was better they both died together.Noah wouldn't have gone on without Alli and Alli would have forgotten who she was.Thats how love today should be not tainted but society.I believe love back then and love now are totally different.It seems more real and less complicated at times.If you haven't watched this film I would highly recommend that you do.It maybe a chick-flick to some but it was truly touching and worth the time.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
My favorite movie!,"This story is absolutely amazing. It has the perfect balance between young love and old love. It shows the viewer how true love, no matter what the circumstance, always prevails in some way or another. This movie shows the bouts of young love so perfectly and depicts emotion so well. Many many thumbs up to the cast of this movie as they all did such a wonderful job allowing us to connect with them and feel the things that they are feeling.

"The Notebook was the best love story literally of all time.  It was written ingeniously and this ""chick flick"" even appeals to men.","I saw the Notebook at the movies with my boyfriend the day it came out. At the time me and my boyfriend had only been going out 3 months and we were a summer love that were both planning to go away to college. We both went to college, but stayed together. Saturday, February 26th will be our 9 month anniversary and he just bought me the DVD for Valentines Day. This movie honestly and vividly depicts the best life-long love story that stems from even summer flings. It shows that love is a result of fate. Love is the most wonderful feeling, but can also drive a person crazy when it is taken away. When you respect, honor, and cherish love the way i is supposed to, you will never regret a second you spend with your soul mate. If you haven't seen this movie... you're definitely missing out and should go buy it immediately... not rent it because your going to buy it eventually because its that good and you would waste 4 dollars by renting it first.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
A 10.  No questions asked.,"The absolute best love story ever put on film. Nothing even comes close.

"""The Notebook: A Romantic Masterpiece with Emotional Depth""","""The Notebook"" stands as a romantic masterpiece that transcends the conventions of its genre. This captivating love story, based on Nicholas Sparks' novel, shines not only due to its emotive plot but also through the skillful performances of its cast and meticulous direction.The film gracefully unfolds through the different stages of Noah and Allie's lives, masterfully portrayed by Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams. The chemistry between the actors is palpable, propelling the narrative to new heights and providing an authenticity that propels the movie beyond typical romantic tales.One of the most outstanding elements is the portrayal of love in old age, embodied by James Garner and Gena Rowlands. The way the film explores the enduring nature of love over the years is touching and offers a unique perspective on the longevity of relationships. The narrative skillfully weaves nostalgic memories with the reality of the present, creating a rich and poignant cinematic experience.Nick Cassavetes' direction deserves praise for its sensitive and artistic approach to adapting the novel. The cinematography and soundtrack perfectly complement the emotional depth of the story, creating an atmosphere that immerses the viewer in the intensity of the emotions.While some may argue that the film follows certain romantic genre tropes, the emotional depth, stellar performances, and exploration of the complexities of love over time elevate ""The Notebook"" to a masterpiece. With a rating of 9/10, this film is a moving experience that lingers in the memory, reminding us of the timeless and beautiful nature of true love.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Honestly!,"OK, when you haven't read the book, it must be the most amazing movie ever, but for me, it was really disappointing to watch. when I was about 10, I read this book, and I LOVED it (despite the love parts thing). But anyway, the book was really inspiring. I cannot believe this movie had a high rating when it the book was much better than the movie. Plus, the book shows much more emphasis on how the two actually loved each other. The movie was just too dull for me compared to the book. My advice is, read the book first than watch this movie if you haven't. The book is the most touching love story I have read.some corrections that I want to say: this movie sort of showed two young lovers who just ran away, and just got lucky with their relationship. It actually makes the movie look bad!!!! first of all, it should have showed how much deeper their love is than making out and stuff that made themselves attracted to each other. If their love is that shallow, it just shows some madly in love teenagers who would break up eventually. Plus, there were a lot of scenes that was totally different from the book. when they make book movies, they must show what the person is thinking even though they can't exactly blurt it out, since it is a film. well, it will be more difficult to do this, but they have to find a way, because everything comes out differently when it is just acting.",5.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

This film was a surprise!,"I saw this film while on a flight from Paris to Los Angeles. I was a bit upset because our plane did not have the small screens with the individual movie choices on it. There was only one movie choice per cabin ""if you want another movie, get on another plane."" Reluctantly (in rebel mode), I started watching it without having the headphones on. Believe it or not, even in silence, the film won me over. I was quickly drawn into it and soon could not stop watching it! Not long after my initial resistance, I put on the headphones. The only negative was the embarrassment I felt for sitting there sobbing on the plane as it is a very moving story. The characters came across with authenticity and were compelling. I also felt the way the film went back and forth between past and present got the message across effectively. At first I did not realise there was a connection between the two characters and as the connection starts to become evident, you become more drawn into their story.

Good chemistry all around...,"Every different genre of film requires something different to make it special. Science fiction needs intelligent storytelling, war films require moving/agonizing drama. And of course, love stories need good chemistry between whoever's supposed to be in love. I thought this one had it in spades, with all concerned. It did get slightly melodramatic at the end, but nothing that anyone who enjoyed ""Somewhere in Time"" (another movie that many love story fans are fond of) couldn't handle... in fact, the former was quite a bit more sappy or melodramatic, and in my opinion this one leans toward realism more than the average. I just saw it ""cold"" on a cable channel without knowing anything about it, and was basically riveted to the screen the entire time. Recommended for fans of the genre, and others should at least dip their toe in and see how it strikes 'em. 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

Does justice to the book,"Based on the best selling novel by Nicholas Sparks.It is the 1940's, and we are introduced to Allie (Rachel McAdams), who lives with her well-off parents. During a carnival, Allie unexpectedly meets Noah (Ryan Gosling). After this encounter, they become very close, and fall in love. Though as they keep seeing each other, Allie's mother, Anne (Joan Allen) disapproves of the relationship, and tells Allie to break it off.Several months later, Allie meets another, Lon Hammond (James Marsden). This soon becomes serious, but Allie still keeps Noah in her heart. Eventually things between Lon and Allie become serious, and become engaged. When Allie reads about her up coming marriage to Lon, she also happens to see a picture of Noah. This leads to Allie spending a couple of days apart from Lon, and visiting Noah.When seeing Noah again, it brings back memories of what they once shared. Will this lead to Allie choosing Lon, or will she be true to herself, and choose Noah?My opinion...I have read the novel, but it has been a while. My sister and I took our mum to see this movie for her birthday, and she really enjoyed it. But this is not just a chick's flick, as our dad also enjoyed the movie also. I have to admit, I did cry twice towards the end. I had heard that you needed tissues, so was well prepared, we all were. I thought the cast did really well.

Has yet to be topped,"The Notebook is, by all accounts, the greatest love story of all time. I have yet to see anyone top this movie in terms of romance.

At the time, I was NOT a person who cried during movies (that is completely opposite now). Its not just about the way it makes you cry though, it teaches anyone a deep lesson about how even the greatest love has flaws and that it has to be worked on every single day, and is always worth it in the end.

I...am a man! Must....not....cry....*snif*....*snif*,"Everyone has been in love at least once in their lives, so why on earth is it difficult to craft a respectable love story? Over the years, it becomes harder and harder to find a good film about love and all its consequences. Even Titanic, the ultimate chick flick, is a disaster for multiple reasons. The romantic drama is a genre with a bad reputation because the genre always gets riddled with movies full of clich√©s, predictability, bad acting, bad dialogue, and the inability to tug at your emotions. For every Beauty and the Beast, you have three terrible romantic movies. For every Ghost, Sleepless in Seattle, Princess Bride, you have dozens of monstrosities. Enter The Notebook.The Notebook is a successful adaptation of a best-selling book by Nicholas Sparks, who is also responsible for A Walk to Remember and Message in a Bottle (the man apparently knows how to appeal to the females). Becoming strongly notorious for bringing out the lovey-dovey in every couple and even more notorious for emotionally destroying females everywhere, The Notebook easily stands as one of the greatest romantic films within the past decade. Becoming everything Titanic wishes it was, this movie is coupled with excellent acting, good dialogue, nicely woven plots, good direction, and good cinematography. Equipped with a good score, nice jazz songs, and a satisfactory ending, this movie will reach out for your heart and will force you to hold a box of tissues throughout the two hours. The surprise success comes with very good reason, for it is a movie that all of those losing faith in love should watch. We all know how difficult love is, especially nowadays in this seemingly cruel and twisted world.It is actually two stories in one. The first is an elderly man named Duke reading a book to this seemingly depressed elderly woman by the name of Allie who looks like she just wants to spend the rest of her life away from everyone else. The story Duke is reading is about a couple (Noah and Allie) whom have to separate after a perfect summer because of differing futures, the parents of the girl, and their social class differences. Both of them move on, but neither of the two ever wants to move past their love for each other; even when they are seen with other people living different lives. The ultimate test occurs when one of the two is actually about to marry. The Notebook switches between the story and what is going on with Duke and Allie. What keeps this movie fresh and different from the others is that it's actually two stories in one, and both are equally heartbreaking and touching. While it could have benefited from releasing more details about certain elements in the movie, the screenplay was excellent and moved at a respectable pace; all thanks to Jan Sardi and Jeremy Laden.Directing and acting are the two strongest portions of the movie. Nick Cassavetes (Alpha Dog, John Q) does a wonderful job progressing the story without being too slow, or too fast. He focuses less on the physical aspects of the relationships and more on the dialogue, more on the emotional aspects, which is a rarity and ends up portraying a much more realistic couple. Complimenting the directing is the cinematography, which shows some beautiful scenery, most notably a scene at a lake full of elegant birds. Rachel MacAdams and Ryan Gosling seem pretty much meant for each other. Their passion towards each other, and their anger towards the cruelty of the environment around them is nearly flawless; every line is delivered well and never crosses into cheesy. The supporting cast is also delightful, most particularly James Garner as the very friendly and patient Duke.Many themes of love are explored here: which includes never forgetting your first love, how love can and will prevail through all obstacles, and how love brings out the best and the worst in you. From the mental and physical breakdown of Noah in the later years to the bitterness that follows the mysterious Allie, love can build you up and tear you apart in a matter of seconds. A major rarity shown in The Notebook is that love is imperfect, and that is shown through the constant arguing between the main characters in the story. Finally, The Notebook isn't as predictable as other romantic flicks, even though they did drop far too many clues and the ending is revealed before it can come and shock you. Nonetheless, the movie ends in a very bittersweet note, so save plenty of tissue paper for the final scene.Bottom Line: Instant classic romantic movie, because they are so hard to find. When you find a movie that can make you smile, cry, waste tissue paper, and hold your loved one for moments longer afterwards, you've found a good movie. The Notebook has very few flaws, it is indeed a very good movie. The love amongst the main characters is far from cheesy and clich√©d. This along with Eternal Sunshine (excellent 2004 romantic drama, totally recommend) stands as the perfect 1-2 romantic drama punch of the decade; they are the best love stories in recent years. A package of good acting, good writing, good directing, and good musical score makes this a must-own if you love these kinds of movies. Breathing some life into the dying genre, The Notebook succeeds as a total tear-jerker; whether you are a male or a female, whether you are single or taken, and whether you have a heart or not.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Breathtaking!,"Come on, what girl doesn't love The Notebook? It was just so touching and sweet, and all around lovable.

I cried my eyes out of my sockets, and some people on this website actually have the nerve to give it a 1? In my opinion, The Notebook sets a great example for the whole Romance genre, and everybody should give this film at least one chance, for when you do, you're bound to love it, though of course if you're a frownie face, stay away, unless you can lighten up, then MAYBE you'll enjoy it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

A film travesty of a touching novel,"This is one of the rare times I have read, and deeply enjoyed, a novel shortly before seeing a film adaptation (of which I had not been aware until noticing it in the local video shop). In comparison to the novel, this film was such a disappointment. In my opinion, a travesty.My wife and I agreed (and that is a fairly rare event in our appraisal of films!) that the casting of all the leading roles, without exception (except Noah's father, who didn't even figure in the novel!), was inappropriate and unsympathetic, and that the special qualities that made this short and economically written book so touching and memorable were lost in the film version. Even the house shown in the film was not all evocative of the one Noah had restored. Above all the descriptions and mood created around Noah on the river at sunrise, and the magical trip leading to the 'bird lake', such powerful images in the book, and of his poetry, were played down to a minimal level.It was as if the task of adaptation to screen was handed to someone who kept only the title and bare outline of the story and then proceeded to create a different, and vastly inferior and less powerful work.What a shame The Notebook has not enjoyed a truly sympathetic or sensitive adaptation like The Bridges of Madison County, Enchanted April or even the recent Ladies in Lavender. The power of the novel deserved this. Perhaps a European director (or Clint Eastwood) would have done it more justice.A missed opportunity.",3.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
"Sloppy, sentimental and manipulative - I loved it","I went into this movie with mixed emotions about my likely responses. On the one hand it had good reviews (on the whole) and responses from people who had seen it. On the other hand it had been castigated by others as shallow and manipulative.Having seen the film, I think I can understand the contrasting responses.On the one hand I would have to agree that the movie is fairly shallow and manipulative, but it is done with such panache that it carries you along.The film is framed by an old man reading to a woman with alzheimers the story of a young man from the lumber works and a young woman from a rich family falling in love, being separated and then meeting again years later when she is engaged to marry another. The relationship of the two older characters is explored as the story from the notebook progresses.With the ""notebook"" story, the film-makers and actors make it easy to understand why Ally fell in love with Noah. They are not as successful in capturing the contrary aspect (other than her beauty, which was not sufficient to explain the degree of obsession shown).What is well established is the dilemma she faces when she discovers that Noah still loves her but she also loves her fianc√©.This is a movie that I recommend seeing with someone you love - but probably only once, because further watching may bring some of the flaws into clearer view.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

It's either hallmark or lifetime channel that has at least one romance movie if not an entire series about restoring old houses and people falling in love. Parts of it reminded me of Forest Gump and parts of Romeo and Juliet and parts reminded me of scenes I've seen in other films just don't remember the names. I watched it one tv and by the first commercial break I thought to myself this is one of those films but why is it 2 1/2 hours long unless they go this route with the storyline. They did, probably to add drama which failed. I know it's based off a book but the storyline regardless of how it started is a collage of clich√©s if it was any more unoriginal it would be a copyright infringement.",1.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
The kind of love you wish you can find,"In my movie going experience, very few movies have the sensitive value of this film, not going into the beauty of the sceneries and the fine costumes that are very well fit to the time and place, The Notebook has that tingle you don't expect but always want from a love story it's a simple love, pure and fresh, torn at some point, difficult at another, with its ups and downs but plain perfect when one looks at it in retrospect.The kind of love that very few find, the kind of love everybody wishes they had, excellent direction, no lingering points, keeps you guessing at some points, but in the end it all adds up, and the feeling you will get after you watch it, hopefully with that special someone, will make the bond even stronger, because it is more than a good movie, it's a shadow of hope, of a time that's gone but can still be found, The Notebook is a see to feel. So go and feel it. It's great.I cried so I give it a perfect 10. Thank you for making this film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
So personal and amazing!,"I absolutely adore this film! I mean how can you not love it...I always thought that Titanic would always be my favourite romantic movie but then then this came along out of the blue and changed everything! The characters are down to earth, the setting is realistic and the actual romance is believable! Its these things that make it feel personal and real. The actors and actresses aren't glamorised or airbrushed and the actual acting is brilliant because the chemistry between Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams is so amazing.

The Best Movie of the Year!,"Get out the tissues you will need them! This is one the best movies I have ever seen.. Rachel and Ryan were magnificent in this tear jerker...

The end was so unexpected as well... I was bawling like a baby... Rachel McAdams delivered a flawless performance as did Ryan Gosling.. They lit up the film and were well paired for this film.

If this isn't perfect then what is?,"If you guys don't call it a perfect movie and what is a perfect movie? I think Notebook should be the definition of a perfect movie. It has covered every perspective of a life, how hard it can be and how soft it can be at the same time. Everyone, literally everyone, no matter what their age is, no matter how do they live or from where they belong, everyone should watch it atleast once in their lifetime, its important! I would request every young and adult individuals to watch it the moment they are thinking about watching it or not. Its everyone's guarantee, those who have watched it, that the worst you can do is to rate it a 9 star.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
A lesson the entire world needs to learn,"This film has the ability to change the world by changing the way people live their lives. If more of us were this committed to our relationships, loved without superficiality, and pursued our goals with such devotion, the divorce rate would be much lower and the world would still be a decent place to live as it was long ago. In today's society we are consumed with materialistic things and insecure enough to be influenced by what others think we should or shouldn't do. The reason ""The Notebook's"" impact on me was so profound is because it does not sugar coat true love in a way that misleads viewers into thinking that a relationship with one's soulmate is without its share of rough spots. It is realistic in the way that it portrays two lovers who quarrel and have difficult obstacles to overcome in order to stay together. The film openly admits that it takes work every day to make a relationship a success. Unfortunately, we live in a world dictated by convenience, therefore, the minute our relationships require extra work we give up because we'd rather look for someone else who has a lower set of standards that are easier to meet. In closing, I would like to say that Noah & Allie serve as an example that we should all aspire to.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Absolutely Beautiful,"Incredibly beautiful, detailed, and stunningly emotional- The Notebook may have some formulaic issues, but is able to overcome them and prove itself to be a very unique and brilliant picture. The film is full of very lively and fantastic performances, most notably Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams who are absolutely perfect in their roles. Their chemistry on screen is amazing, and the even more surprising part of it is that they had a hard time getting along at first, both as characters and in real life. The cinematography in the film is often brilliant, and at its best, absolutely gorgeous. The direction is also quite good, surprising for this type of film, and goes to show where good direction could lead you in a film that can feel so much weaker without it. Luckily, the film is strongly lead, both directionally and through the actors on the screen, to make for a truly impactful and unforgettable love story that i'm sure will be cherished for years to come. The music in the film is very good as well, as well as the atmosphere in the film, and the feel in the film overall is continually impressive. At it's worse, the film can be a bit predictable and formulaic- containing a few tropes that you have seen in countless romantic films before. However, it doesn't impact the film too much, and for the most part it still remains an endlessly entertaining and beautiful time. In the end, The Notebook is a surprisingly special film- that is nearly perfect except when it decides to play it too safe. It's direction is impressive, as well as its lead performances from Gosling and McAdams, and its overall cinematography and feel is endlessly beautiful.

Love is the beginning for everything,"I still remember the last sense of the story "" Note Book"".When Allie asked Noah that our love could take us together. Noah said that ""love"" could make anything if we wanted to. That's the point which make me get the love is love is miracle between the two of them. And love is none of other's business except the couple of them. Love is just around you that will never go. It's seems to be everything you know. I use to be lost in the story of love. I believe love is based to trust somebody or to begin everything. I've got many lesson about love when I've watched this movie ""The Notebook"" about the power of love. When you think one don't deserve another one of two lovers to get started for the future of being couple of life. It is not fair or love. Please, be with love and own your body and spirit of love to each other that will make you warm forever without loneliness in the world.

absolutely the best love story i've ever seen,"i work in a video store and the anticipation for this film was almost unbearable -- its just so real and fantasy like at the same time, it makes you laugh at the similarities of your own relationship and yet cry at how sad and crushing their story was. It makes your heart leap at moments and then fall the very next -- its just an amazing movie and the powerfulness of it is just incredible....its perfect!!! I absolutely fell in love with the story of Noah and Allie - the ""will they/won't they"" is just so heart wrenching when you understand the obstacles that they had to face in order to be with one another and then the after-math that follows in the midst to their happily ever after love. The powerfulness of the ""notebook"" itself in the story - that someone would document their love in a book -- and the inscription "" read this to me, - and I'll come back to you"" -- gives me chills just thinking about it. The characters couldn't have been chosen better. - You can almost feel Noah's pain as he tries to move on without his love. -",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
A Must See,"The movie was great. This is one movie where you really get the meaning of true love. Yes true love does exist for some, yet we strive all our lives to reach it, and these two found it.It is a movie where all ages can relate to. The young audience has dreams of obtaining this kind of relationship. The older audiences have this kind of relationship.The cast's performance was spectacular. These roles that the actors play are so believable and they are someone you can relate to. They capture the moments and bring it directly to you, they challenge your feelings and outlook on life with every scene. They have the ability to tug on your heart strings, make you think about relationships, and get insight into the loving relationships that we have,but take for granted everyday.The movie gives you the insight necessary to pull this one off. The whole movie is filled with passion, love, understanding, compassion and hardships that pay off. The determination of the actors are president throughout the movie.The overall movie rating is a MUST SEE, you will not be disappointed.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
My Absolute Favourite :-D,"Okay, I admit I'm an absolute sucker for love films with a sweet, sad ending. I don't quite know how I came across this film but I had read many reviews on it on IMDb. I read that if you love love stories you will absolutely fall in love with this film, and thats exactly what i did. I wasn't feeling very well one day so i sat down with my mum and decided you watch this film. And about 2 hours later I had a box of tissues in my hand and was completely overcome with tears, and from then on its become my absolute favourite film!! From beginning to end its absolutely beautiful.

One of the best love stories ever written,"I think this is one of the best love stories ever written. A co-worker of mine encouraged me to watch this movie and I have about ten times. Each time without a dry eye, I even have my husband crying. The two main characters Noah and Allie are so astonishing and have such amazing chemistry on the camera. True love is unforgettable and unbreakable, going to any lengths to get his true love to remember him and keeping his promise is outstanding. I love how in the very end Allie shows up with her bags and hunches her shoulders, beautiful. They were meant to be together as the movie shows until death. Go see this movie!While its been done before, its never been done this way. With such depth and emotion, the predictable ending is no fault of the movie.

"The Most Beautiful, Touching Movie Ever Made","""The Notebook"" is the most amazing movie I have ever seen. The script was well-written, the actors phenomenal, and the overall effect enthralling. ""The Notebook"" was based on Nicolas Sparks' novel and was even better than the book. It was a beautiful romance that wasn't too mushy and captured the kind of love everyone longs for. The actors were absolutely amazing, portraying emotions that most actors have trouble with almost effortlessly and flawlessly. Rachel McAdams, who has starred in movies of every genre and done wonderfully in all of them, blew me away. Ryan Gosling was amazing as well, and there are no words to describe their chemistry. James Garner and Gena Rowlands were such a great pair that they made elderly love seem beautiful.

I cried like a baby,"Some films hit you hard, but The Notebook? It's one of those rare movies that leaves you emotionally shattered in the most beautiful way. I spent nearly 40 minutes crying through it, not just because of the sadness that permeates the story, but because of how incredibly relatable and sincere the love between Allie and Noah feels.The early stages of their romance are portrayed with a stunning realism that makes you remember-or imagine-what it's like to fall in love for the first time. The passion, the volatility, the playful obsession with each other-it all feels so genuine, capturing the raw, unfiltered emotions of young love.The plot twist, while somewhat predictable, still hit me like a tidal wave. It's the kind of revelation that you see coming but can't emotionally prepare for. Even knowing what was about to happen didn't stop the flood of tears. The way the movie builds up to this moment, with so much beauty and melancholy intertwined.Every scene, every interaction, carries a deep poetic weight, creating a visual and emotional symphony that leaves you aching long after the credits roll.Honestly, this movie left me with the feeling that I might never be happy again-and yet, I wouldn't trade that experience for anything. The Notebook is a bittersweet masterpiece, the kind of film that reminds you how powerful love can be, even when it's devastating. Prepare your tissues because this is a journey you'll cry through, but also a story you'll never forget.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Wonderful old-fashioned love story,"Having heard very little about this film, I ended up seeing it purely by accident, and was very glad that I did.As 2004 draws to a close, I can say without doubt that it was the best film I have seen all year, if not ever.Although it has been criticised for being unrealistic and clich√©d, I don't find these accusations particularly helpful. It is true that it follows a fairly traditional and predictable romantic plot-line, but I think this is part of its charm. As you might expect from an adaptation of a novel, it's the story that carries the film, rather than special effects or comedy.The actors were well-cast, and I liked the fact that the young stars (Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams) were relatively little known, compared to other, big-name actors - it made the story more accessible somehow. Balanced by the excellent Hollywood stalwart James Garner's scenes with Gena Rowlands, the overall effect is highly watchable and convincing.The romantic drama of 'The Notebook' also makes a refreshing change to the stream of distinctly average ""rom-coms"" that have hit our screens in recent years. It manages to hold a poignancy and emotional impact where the run-of-the-mill money-spinners fail. Although films like 'Love Actually' have poignant scenes, they are but moments amongst the general light-weight schmaltz. It takes a lot for a film to move me to tears, but this one managed it.It might not be a masterpiece in the eyes of a serious critic, but in terms of being able to tell a poignant, old-fashioned love story in a no-frills, beautifully shot film, this one wins for me every time.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Where can I find this notebook?,"First of all, I loved the movie. It's THE greatest love story of all time. I have looked in every bookstore that I come across for a great love story, but I can't find one. I want to know where I can find ""the notebook"". It's an amazing tale about life and love. It's got moments that make you laugh, cry and just be happy for who you are.Secondly, I'm so proud that i'm Canadian, and the fact that we have many talented actors, such as Mike Myers, Jim Carrey, Keanu Reeves...oh ya, Rachael McAdams and Ryan Gosling.I've seen Ryan Gosling in ""Murder by Numbers"" with Sandra Bullock, and although he was hott in that movie, he kind of had a devilish look to him, but when I saw him in ""The Notebook"" he was like a saint, love his smile by the way.This movie is great, love Gina Rowlands and James Garner too, both were great. Wonderful story, fantastic writing, the acting was very incredible.

The ultimate love story. No question about it.,"My mother referred me to this movie a short while ago. I was skeptical because I find most chick flicks to be a little corny.

Being that my fianc√© looks very close to the young version of Noah (beard and all) it made our love life more intense. ... A LOT. :D :D :D Please please please don't pass this movie up or you will regret it.

Not romantic,Sigh another movie celebrating toxic behaviour from men and calling it love. Threatening to off yourself if a woman doesn't go out with you? Yeah don't do that. I checked out mentally after that riveting opening scene to the couples story. Then the rest of the movie is about Allie constantly wishing she was with Noah for some reason instead of Lon who clearly loves her.

This is the number 1 movie of 2004,"I was in love with the Notebook when I read it by Nicholas Sparks. Normally, I wouldn't go to see a movie that was first a book, only because the books are always so much better, but I fell in love with the trailer for the Notebook the moment I saw it. The song Tonight and The Rest My Life by Nina Gordon amplified the love scene that is shown in the trailer, after I saw that I couldn't wait to see the movie. The First time I went to see the movie I saw it with my parents, my 24 year old sister, her 24 year old fianc√©e, and my best friend who's 18 like me; and by the end of the movie we were all crying. That covers a couple of different age groups, and both sexes. The second time I went to see it in the theater was with my boyfriend, who's 18 and he also loved it even though he thought he would hate it completely. When the movie was over we were both crying (well he was tearing up even though he wouldn't admit it) and he couldn't stop telling me how much he loved me. Now, I've covered 3 different age ranges, 2 sexes, and 2 races. The third and final time i went to see it in the theater was with my other 2 friends, who were also my age and also loved it. Every time I saw it I loved it. I cried and laughed all three times I saw it. After I saw it the third time, I decided that I would have to wait until it came out on DVD to see again, because i couldn't spend the rest of my summer in the dark theater, even though i would've if i could.. but no matter how much my boyfriend, friends, and families loved the movie they wouldn't allow me to see it again and again. So i ended seeing it 3 times in the theater and now i have to wait one more week for it to come out on DVD and I am fiending for it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

Romantic Love Story,"I watched this movie last night and enjoyed it very much. As stated in some of the other reviews, this is a fairly typical boy from wrong side of the tracks meets rich girl, boy and girl fall in love kind of movie. What makes this story somewhat different is the way it is presented: an old man reading the love story to an old woman in a nursing home. It was the two senior citizens and their relationship in the movie which touched me the most. The main characters were wonderfully cast and make the story come to life. The setting in a small southern town makes for some lovely scenery. I found the movie to be somewhat predictable on the whole, and also a little unrealistic but still a wonderful love story.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Guys ¬ñ a good 'chick flick' to appease your woman,"The ONLY reason I went to see this movie was because I owed my wife a chick flick. She sat through that disaster known as Van Helsing with me (which she seldom lets me forget) so I owed it to her, and I only hoped that it wasn't going to hurt too badly or be too boring. I was quite pleasantly surprised, and must admit that the end of the movie left me in tears.I've read other reviews and have seen the words sappy, sentimental, manipulative, and shallow, and that some of the situations are hopelessly unrealistic. And yes, all that is true, but done in such a beautiful and sincere way that it didn't bother me that much. The two leading actors had excellent chemistry, but still not as good as between James Garner and Gina Rowlands.I'm glad I watched it. It didn't hurt.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Now is the time to say it: All you need is love,"I was, when I saw it some weeks ago, and still am amazed with this movie. I'm talking about one of the best romantic movies I've ever seen. The romantic movies that combine that passionate loved with drama and a perfect chemistry between the leads.My God! Rachel McAdams looked gorgeous in this picture; that's one thing that had to be said. Her performance was also great, for the kind of character she was playing (I'm saying this because of the other characters she has played; superficial sometimes). She can actually act, and this role is going to give her the opportunity to grow, although it was not recognized. I'm not saying it was overlooked, but it was impossible. Ryan Gosling got the performance of his life as Noah. He has chosen interesting roles in the past, but didn't have the chance to shine. Every move he makes here is perfect; his performance is flawless (although, as McAdams, impossible to be recognized). His way of talking remind me of Sylvester Stallone, when he played Rocky in the first film of the anthology; a little bit rough and dumb, but the perfect sum for a person in love. Anyway, the movie depended on the chemistry between the two young actors, and they didn't disappoint at all.The pros, Garner and Rowlands, have the same chemistry Gosling and McAdams have, only that they are older. Garner has been recognized with the Screen Actors Guild, for his whole career, and with his performance as Duke, he closes a cycle of an entire career. Rowlands seems pleased to be working with his son; who must admire her for everything she has done. Her work is remarkable, as Nick's. I heard Cassavetes directed this film because he wanted to. He hasn't got a great career as a director, but he knows what he's doing. He knows how to create the environment, for the whole movie, and for each frame in it. I saw him watching the actors from close, in each scene. He wants to watch everything; direct but also make the actors feel comfortable and sure of what they are doing. It shows.""The Notebook"" is actually a novel. And if it wasn't because of Nicholas Sparks' hands and inspiration (when he wrote his first novel), this film wouldn't exist. How romantic a story can be when it starts with the paragraph that says more or less like this: ""I'm a common man. There are no monuments dedicated to me and soon my name will be forgotten; but in one way, I have succeeded as any other being in this world: I have loved another person with all my heart"". The answer you'll find it watching ""The notebook"". The movie has many beautiful and moving scenes; sometimes, you know what is going to happen although you don't want that to happen. But those are the scenes you will see, and enjoy as I did.I don't know if this has been said, but I had to put it. The rain is falling down, and Allie (McAdams), says angrily to Noah (Gosling): ""Why did you end it? Why was it over?"". ""It was not over"", he answers with tears in his eyes. ""And it still isn't over"".And it will never be.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Notebook is about ageless undying Love,"I have seen many love stories as movies (and I'm sure most of us as well), so by now I've somewhat become averse to them. Notebook was for long in my list, but I kept pushing it away because everyone told me its a love story. Today, When I watched it, I must say that I was missing something for that long time, and I'm happy that I watched it.At the bottom, I didn't find Notebook's story very different. Teenagers falling in love, getting apart and their further extensions have been long portrayed in cinema and novels. Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams played roles of young Noah and Allie beautifully, and justified to the roles. Rachel whom I have seen as a naughty girl in Mean Girls and Hot Chick was really sweet as an innocent cute girl. I was impressed with James Marsden too, though he shared screen for short time. However, all this wasn't all which touched me. James Garner and Gena Rowlands had to come to screen.Most will say there was only one story in the movie, but I found there were two. James as old Noah along with Gena as old Allie do not share much of screen, but they grow their own love story in unique way alongwith Ryan and Rachel. Where all would take months and years to win their ladies, James does it in one day! As the story unfolds, all characters look good, but what touches you is that one day love story.As the way I made my title, Notebook is about that love, that ageless undying love, which remains in each of us till we die, or even after death who knows. I gave 9 for 10 for those touching moments.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Incredible!,"When my roommate and I first arrived at the theatres to see The Notebook, the people coming out of the theatre who had seen the movie before us were all wiping their eyes. This movie is a real tear jerker, so you have been warned. It is the story of 2 young adults who meet at a carnival: Noah, a poor boy who works at the Lumber yard, and Allie, a rich girl who is on summer vacation with her family in Seabrook. All summer long, the 2 are inseparable. But Allie's parents don't approve of Noah (because he does not come from money) and forbid her to see him again. This complicates things between the two, and soon Allie is leaving Seabrook to go back to Charleston. Noah writes to Allie everyday for a year. 7 years later, Allie meets and falls in love with a handsome soldier named Lon, and soon he asks to marry her. During their engagement, Allie notices that in the paper on the same page as her wedding announcement is a picture of Noah standing near a house he rebuilt for her. She then must go back to Seabrook to see him before marrying Lon, and is flooded with old feelings for Noah. Allie is then forced to choose between the man that was her first love, and the man that her parents want her to marry.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Beautiful,"I have absolutely no idea what to say about this movie. I thought I would hate it. A really popular romance that all the kiddies loved? I was positive that I was gonna make it through half the film (if even) and scream "" What a load of crap!"". But that didn't happen. Now, I have to admit I was curious. I am a fan of Gena Rowlands and her late husband. But don't know much about Nick. McAdams is cute and Gosling was great in Lars...I really didn't want to see this movie. A friend recommended it ...so my husband and I sat down, watched the movie. And I cried. Yup, like a little sissy. The tears just ran down. In all honesty I can say that I was surprised and really inspired by this film. You don't find that many love stories that you can truly relate to. But you can with ""The notebook"". Anyone can understand the characters and basic trauma of their lives because they are ordinary. Most films are based on a platonic and ideal love, but in this story, we can actually relate with the characters and their relationships. That's why it's special. Anyone can understand it. Other than that, I have to say that the movie was beautifully made, set design, photography, etc...but the actors.... damn! Talk about chemistry!",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

The Notebook makes me cry every time!,I'm completely in love with the Notebook. It makes me cry every single time I watch it. Nicholas Sparks is an amazing writer and the movies that have come from his novels are pure genius in the chick flick genre. When I've just broken up with someone or I'm just having a really bad day I often find myself curled up with a Nicholas Sparks book. The Notebook represents that true love that every single little girl hopes she will one day find. Most of us aren't that lucky but this story really gives me the hope that true love really is out there. I can't even begin to explain how highly I recommend this movie. It is one of the greatest love stories of all time.,10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
best movie ever,"Thie is the most romantic best movie I have ever seen and the book is awesome too. It makes you wish for that kind of love, huh?

I was reading it at the beach just crying my eyes out and all theses kids were just looking at me like I was crazy! HA! I hope they make a movie out of it too. the book of the notebook has a different ending then the movie so if they make a movie of the Wedding they will have to change that.

Phenomenal,"I cant really put into words what I think of this movie.. honestly. It is so fantastic. I get goose bumps watching some parts and just cry. I can watch this movie 3 times a day, easily. Okay, so maybe that is a sickness, but how can you not adore it? The love and passion that Noah and Allie have for each other is so exciting. I think every girl just dreams of that kind of love some day. Not to mention that Ryan Gosling is gorgeous. And Rachel McAdams is so adorable in this movie, she is so full of life. you just wish they were together in real life. I would love to grow up in the South during the 1940s. Life was so simple back then. Our generation sucks. So much technology and everyone is so worried about their appearance and money status. Life was so simple for them in this movie. They were completely in love, and thats all they needed. The Notebook is the best portrayal of a love story, it really doesn't get any better than that!",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

I honestly had forgotten just how... compelling and heart wrenching this is and also loved being transported back to the 1940's. Just an epic love story on all counts.I guess its reached cult status by now as one of the best romance movies of all time. I know it is for me. Even being familiar with the story I still found myself all caught up in Noah and Allie's star crossed lovers romance. And Jeez I had forgotten all about James Garner, I almost started crying as soon as I heard his voice, just fantastic. ""I am no one special just a common man with common thoughts...""I think this might be one of the few adaptions where I actually like the movie better than the book too. Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams are perfect and give the characters such life, creating everlasting magic together. I can't imagine anyone else in those roles, and the chemistry, its no wonder that carried off screen for a time. Yup I fell a little in love with Ryan Gosling again myself.As a whole this is old fashioned storytelling. Its episodic, well acted on all counts, gripping, shameless and beautifully shot, I mean come on, the scene with he swans, and god damn that kiss in the rain.

Pulls at the heartstrings.,"When I first watched this film I cried my eyes out. I'm glad to say that knowing what's coming, helped a little bit and I had tissues to hand just in case.It's a charming story of love and the problems that arise from it. It doesn't end well for everybody, but it's the kind of love we're all looking for. I want to get caught in the rain and snog the face of my forever love. WHERE'S MY MOVIE ROMANCE GODAMMIT??? But I digress.The actors all do a great job and Ryan is incredibly cute at the beginning, how could she even think of turning him down, but then there's James M later on and it would be a tough call to decide between the two.

Poignant but predictable,"I just viewed this movie last night, as part of a $5 bet with a girl. She told me she would pay me $5 if I did not like the movie. Since she had been right before, most notably with the enjoyable Bill Murray vehicle LOST IN TRANSLATION, I decided to give this one a try.My verdict? Standard ""chick flick"" with the obligatory tear-jerking moments. Unusually predictable storyline even for a woman's movie, standard to substandard acting, and obviously fake facial hair which provides an unintentional comic distraction. While it was pleasant to see the former YOUNG HERCULES star trying a dramatic role, he looked lost without his companions from that show, and possibly a good fight scene to liven up the plot. Of course, if it contained a good fight, it wouldn't be a ""chick flick"" - would it guys?It is not a bad film, and it has a good message. Trust me though - I was happy to collect the $5 at the end, and that made the whole evening worthwhile.

20 Years Later....and it's still the greatest love story ever told.,The Notebook has been my favorite movie from the moment I first watched it. Hard to believe that was 20 years ago. There aren't many movies that can evoke such feelings deep in one's soul.If you are a fan of a great love story and 2 leads who are perfect in their respective roles - then this is for you.Ryan Gosling does his best work here and Rachel McAdams portrays Allie's emotional struggle perfectly.

Very old fashion story but it's so touching!!!,"Actually, the story was really old fashion and you can guess all the ways out but it's still a really touching movie and I didn't help but crying so bad last night when I watched it...I haven't cried for that serious for a movie for a while already. The movie started telling a old man telling a love story to his wife and he hoped it could help her to recall some of her memories when they were young... An educated and rich girl fell in love with a poor guy and being separated with her parents...you can guess everything, but the director made this movie so beautiful and sad....Finally, the movie revealed that the notebook that writing the love story was actually written by his wife and she asked her husband to read it to him whenever she forgot him...The wife asked her husband if their love could make them die on the same day and they did die in the same day eventually...It's really touching and I think everyone should think more about finding your life spouse, you shouldn't marry simply a rich guy but someone who are truly in love with you!!

A romantic movie built on sensitivity and class,"If you want to get into a romantic mood, this is definitely the film to watch. In my humble opinion, it's one of the finest movies done in a recent while.

I cried and was inspired with the former and heard good reviews about the latter. I can't wait to watch that second movie now.Sparks is a romanticist women must love and most men fail to comprehend. He's certainly a sensitive individual who is able to capture concepts in the printed word.

Never Give Up on the One You Love,"""The Notebook"" is one of my favorite love stories of all time. In the beginning of the film there is this elderly couple who is living in the nursing home in different locations in the facility. The husband, Duke (James Garner), is living in a part of the nursing home where the nurses can keep an eye on him because he has problems with his heart, and the wife, Allie Calhoun (Gena Rowlands) is living in the Alzheimer's ward. Duke comes over to her room everyday and reads a little bit from the notebook that he wrote of their life together when they were younger, because Allie couldn't remember anything from their past. The director Nick Cassavetes delivers a message in ""The Notebook"" to never give up on the one you love. Cassavetes shows this when Noah Calhoun (Ryan Gosling) and Allie Hamilton (Rachel McAdams) were young and in love, and they were pretty much forced to break up because her parents made her move. Then seven years later she realized that she was still in love with him after she seen the picture of the house in the paper that he promised to build, so she went back and they fell back in love. Nick Cassavetes also expressed that by showing how Noah never gave up on his Allie while she was struggling with dementia. Noah was doing everything that he could think of, for example, reading the notebook of their past, so she could possibly regain some of her memory that she had lost from the disease.""The Notebook"" is the most romantic movie I have ever seen. The costumes that they wear in the movie were perfect and beautiful. When the couple breaks up because of her parents and her having to go away to college after the summer ends was heartbreaking. My favorite scene in the movie is when Noah and Allie went out on the pond, and there were dozens of geese on the pond, then it started to rain when they were on their way back to the house, and that was when they had realized that they still had strong feelings toward each other.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

Love can and should feel that way. Marriage has it's ups and downs, but if there is genuine friendship, passion, and trust, it is the makings of a long lasting relationship as depicted in the movie. I saw this movie with my 3 kids (my son included). All of us got something out of it. My daughters learned that love must be about that, money dwindles down to nothing eventually without love.

lovely story!,"What can I say about the movie??? It's just a love story of two 17 kids named Noah and Allie.

Two kids are crazy about each other but ""as usual"", it doesn't work out when they are young. A couple of years later, when they grow older, they meet one another again and the spirit as well as the chemistry between the two still exist so strongly. Then, nothing could prevent them from being together.The plot is admittedly predictable. However, Until now, I can't fathom why I don't feel the movie any disturbed.

The greatest love story... EVER!,"I saw this movie twice in theaters and three more times when it came out, I absolutely love this movie with all my heart! I think it is the greatest love story of all time because it is so human, and so heart-felt. It's one of those deliciously well-written and well-acted movies that make you laugh and cry and think and feel so many emotions all at once. I loved the story-line and the plot, and I think it has to be said that there was not a single ""bad actor"" in this entire movie- my boyfriend agrees and he's very picky about his movies. I laughed when Finn asks, ""Do you two love each other?"" the night they go to the movies and dance in the street, I laughed when elderly Allie comments about how many pills Noah takes, ""How sick are you?"" I loved the down-to-earth fun that young Noah and Allie had, like riding their bikes with friends and swimming in the river. I think it's the kind of romance, even if it is fleeting, that we all want to experience. It made me so mad the way Allie's parents reacted to Noah just because he was from the ""wrong side of the tracks"" (so to speak). I bawled when Finn died, I bawled when they broke up (I wanted to kill both of them for breaking up when it was so obvious that they were in love, but I knew what Noah meant, and what prompted it, when he said that fancy things and nice things weren't in the cards for him, he wanted what was best for her and he didn't think that he was it), I bawled when Noah's father died (He was the jolliest person in the movie, I love Sam Sheperd's character!), I bawled when Allie left Seabrook, I bawled when her mother wouldn't give her the letters, I cried during the entire movie. I laughed at the story of how Noah used to stammer and poetry was the only thing that worked. I also loved how the movie reveals so much about the characters but leaves just enough for you to wonder about, like for example, does Allie's mother really understand her feelings for Noah? does she regret what she did? does she really only want what's best for her daughter or is she trying to prove a nasty point by showing Allie the man she almost ran off with, who's still in Seabrook and still labors for pennies a day? Or how about Martha? Does she understand, does she feel happy for Noah? Is Allie jealous that this is the woman her man has been spending the past seven years with? Sometimes it was just so aggravating, like Allie going back to talk to Lon after the few wonderful days she spent with Noah. But it just added to the story and made it that much more real. I thought for sure that Allie was going to be hit by that truck when she was leaving Noah, and that's why she couldn't remember, and when Allie said that she knew she should be with Lon and it went to the scene of elderly Noah closing the book I was outraged because I thought that Allie stayed with Lon (because in the nursing home they called him Duke. I finally realized that it was for Allie's sake, so she wouldn't get worked up with him being there because she couldn't really remember who he was). I think everyone can relate to this movie, whether it's because they've loved someone so much or lost someone, or for the lucky few who have actually experienced that kind of passion like in the movie. I think the acting really sealed this movie as the best in years (in my opinion), even though we all know it's just a story the way the actors present what their character is feeling is so moving, like the night in the mansion, the look in Allie's eyes as they are undressing in front of one another and the way she says that she's OK after she won't shut up and Noah asks. Her swig of beer after learning that the room they are eating in now is the one they were in seven years ago. All around this movie is great, I love it! I can't think of one bad thing to say about it, and everyone should see it!",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
When love transcends reality to become a lasting one... or to remain even longer...,"I saw ""The Notebook"" two weeks ago but my 'record' with the film dates back for a little longer.It was 15 years ago when a banal chat with my buddy ended with the surprising reveal that his all-time favorite movie was a romance named ""The Notebook. Mine was ""The Godfather"", which he loved as well, but there was something oddly touching in that soft spot for a film you wouldn't expect a big burly guy to count among the lovers. And so for many years, my knowledge about ""The Notebook"" was limited to three elements: it starred Gena Rowlands, my all-time favorite actress, it featured a passionate kiss under a rainy sky and it was my friend's favorite film.After finally watching it and relieved with the anticipation of any other emotional climax, I don't think it's anywhere in my personal Top 20 but like Ebert said about Siskel's favorite film ""Saturday Night Fever"": ""we all have movies like that, titles that transcend ordinary categories of good and bad, and penetrate straight to our hearts."" Basically, the film penetrated my friend's heart more than it did to mine and we just don't control our emotions. Had he watched it a few years later, it probably wouldn't have the same effect. That's it, our sentimental weaknesses are due to nostalgic values rather than inner qualities. After all, I do have the same feeling for a movie like ""Young Guns"" though I agree the greatest Western ever it ain't.But it's still fitting that the uncontrollability of feelings is one of the film's central themes. And directed by Nick Cassavetes and adapted from Nicholas Sparks' novel, ""The Notebook"" is both a sparkling romance and a passionately romantic movie and that's not the same thing: a romance focuses on the reality of the relationship, a romantic film makes reality the true obstacle. And as soon as Noah (Ryan Gosling) crosses the path of Allie (Rachel MacAdams) we realize that reality has no bearing whatsoever on him: hanging on a ferris wheel to get a date, laying on the road to contemplate the dark night, the young poet of love would even trade his own personality to be whatever Allie desires. Naturally, it doesn't take long for her to become his reality.But then the harsher reality makes an intrusion when they meet the parents: while Noah's father (Sam Shepard) appreciates Allie, her parents don't disapprove of the romance but disregard it as a summer fling. The mother (Joan Allen) informs Noah that Allie will leave for New York and from that things escalate rapidly to a breakup too melodramatic to be truly sincere. But fate doesn't give them time to take their words back, war pushes Noah further from Allie and the mother pulls a ""Color Purple"" by hiding all Noah's letters. Later we learn that she had lived a similar romance before and didn't want her daughter to do a mistake out of a romantic impulse, especially when you have Lon, a tall, dark, incredibly rich and handsome war veteran who's just proposed her. He's played by James Marsden.That the film doesn't portray him as a villain is the right move because the real antagonists are all the obstacles that keep popping up in the sinuous road between the two hearts. And at that part of the review, I have to mention the 'subplot' which is the reading of that very story in modern times: Duke, a man played by James Garner, retells the story to an older and distinguished woman (Rowlands). We quickly understand that they're the older version of Allie and Noah and Duke's devotion is inspiring: asked to get back home by his family, he retorts; ""this is my sweetheart here"". The act he pulls everyday wishing for only five minutes of remembrance is worth the effort, wasn't he the same fiery romantic fellow who wrote 365 letters to his sweetheart?You got it ""The Notebook"" is romantic, it's perhaps the most assumedly romantic film of the last years, it has passion, furor, arguments, sensuality, sex, hell, it even has hesitations. For once I was happy to see a character struggling and incapable to make the right choices, I was glad that the first sex scene wasn't exactly an apotheosis. Ryan Gosling is strangely hypnotic as the eternal dreamer crazy enough to build his dream house and refusing to sell it even for twice its value. And Rachel MacAdams is the perfect counterpart as the spoiled brat who can both jump to his arms or hit him on the shoulders because he's only telling the truth. Both form a wonderful pair and the performances of Garner and Rowlands allow us to consider that the passing of ages can dilute the zest of passion but never at the expenses of true complicity.The film features many great-looking shots showing the bucolic and postcard-like beauty of the South: rivers, lakes, forest, majestic house with obsolete charm. And in one of these natural spots of beauty, you have that passionate kiss under the rain, certainly one of the most romantic movie moments ever. Directed by Rowland's son, Cassavetes brings the best out of his mother without overexploiting the emotions as his father did. This restraint pays off in making the emotional breakdown extremely powerful with Garner's tearful reaction. Watching a man cry always gets me anyway.But maybe I wish the film could have stopped right after we saw Duke holding the notebook. I'm not sure the film needed these last five minutes where it lingered on the whole hospital ambiance. Sometimes, it's better to let the audience figure out what would happen next and the last scene, as powerful as it was, was too on-the-nose for me, maybe it was the one drop too many, romantically speaking.After watching the film, I called my friend... but that's another story.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
An elderly gentleman reads to a female companion from a notebook.,"I had read the book and was anxious to see the movie version of this wonderful love story. As it came nearer I found out who was in the film and so with the words from the novel in my head and as I watched this became real for me. James Garner has one of the best narratives that you ever want to hear. I felt I was the recipient of this telling and got involved in it. What was it about teen love? To win the heart of another? Get them together is what and who cares? Even with all of the films now and what you expect is happening in them, this is one that will get to your heart. The different backgrounds, the not so approval from the parents, what do we do kind of thing? And so these young lovers part and have to move on to live their lives. The war is going on and all and then Noah goes to make something of himself. Allie finds out he has restored a plantation and she goes out of curiosity to see him and finds that she still loves him. But she is engaged to be married and he has been dating a young widow. But things have way of working out and due to misunderstanding and parental protection of not getting some letters to her, she has to choose over two men. The present day meshes nicely from the flashbacks and you think that the older Allie isn't remembering her past, but she does and then she realizes the man reading to her is her husband Noah. She is pleased to discover he went with her wishes of reading to her in her state of dementia and for a few minutes she is normal again. But with her illness she is scared and gets panic attacks and doesn't know the man. He is broken up and suffers a mild stroke and is gone for a while, but she looks for the man who befriended her. She is asleep and he comes to her room and tells her he loves her. She remembers him and they are together against the rules but what is love? To have this love forever... and Noah cherishes the times she knows him in the place they are and he isn't leaving her. The promise was to read to her to have her remember. It's sweet and the actors make you feel you know the characters.. it's mushy and it's teary and it's straight forward and it's wonderfully written and directed.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
"I didn't just watch the movie, I felt it","Haven't seen anything of this touching in years. The movie just made my day. In fact, it tells us how eternal love can be between two bodies with the same soul. If you really love someone, let them free like a bird, they would be back for sure if they have loved you too. I thought A Walk to remember was Sparks' best piece, but I was wrong. I believe Sparks gives us more and more surprises. I also sincerely request directors that more of Sparks stories be picked. These days the trend has been so different that we hardly find such movies. I wish good health and happiness for all those who've been part of the movie.

One of the most romantic movies ever made,I adored The Notebook. The two leads had the most amazing chemistry and were completely believable and realistic for the whole movie. The love James Garner(Noah) showed for his beloved Ali was breathtaking. The scenery was very beautiful especially the scenes with the birds on the lake. This movie was nothing but class from start to finish. I believe it showed how two people (complete strangers) can become one and that there are definitely soulmates in this life. Ryan Gosling was outstanding as the young Noah with his piercing eyes and sensitive nature. Rachel McAdams was a breath of fresh air as Ali and connected physically and spiritually to her costar Ryan. I have also read the book and highly recommend it as well.,10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
enchanting and wonderful,"what can i say. i don't think I've fully recovered from this film. it broke my heart. it is beautiful,passionate and very sad. when i said recovered, i meant that I've only just stopped crying. this is the most captivating film you will ever see. the story surrounds two teenagers who fall in love pre-world war two. events break them apart, but fate brings them back together. and the whole story of the two teenagers love is read to a ageing lady by her gentlemen friend. the cast is spectaculer. Ryan gosling plays Noah, and Rachel McAdams plays Allie. (the two teenagers) and they are wonderful. as is the great James garner who reads the story of these two teenagers to his elderly lady friend, played by the wonderful Gena Rowland's. if you like romance at its best, then this is the film for you...but be warned you will need hankies at the ready! wonderful!!!",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

A load of CRAP,"Come on people, what is new about this story? If you are a male and actually sat through this junk it's probably because your girlfriend or wife thought it would be a romantic evening well spent. Well, isn't that just sweet? Now I have spent approximately 12 minutes looking over the reviews that folks posted in regards to this junk. I cannot believe that people are falling head over heels for this picture. I don't see anything original or creative about this, which would make it worth my $9.00 (adult ticket),nor my $2.00 (rental fee). We've seen this story too many times. Boy meets girl at a carnival and they then fall in love. Oh wait, doesn't every love story need to have the adversity issues near to the middle of the film? Well, of course they do, and this one follows the trendy path. Ally, the girlfriend, develops Alzheimer's disease. Gosh, my heart just poured right into my lap once this was revealed. Look, all you guys out there that raved about this film are a sorry excuse for the male gender. Now it's your turn to have her sit through a movie. Go ahead and torment her with films like ""Roger Dodger"", ""Zomibe"", ""Cobra"", ""Die Hard"", ""Slumber Party Massacre"",""Nightmare On Elm Street 3: The Dream Warriors"", or ""Vice Academy."" I think that with those titles you'll be able to form some sort of a decision. The only redeeming thing that this movie offered was that James Gardner had some affiliation with the film, and that is the only reason that I even give it two starts. There is NOTHING NEW here.",2.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
You should see it if you don't want a part in your life to be missing.,"From the start till the end, I was totally pulled into the movie. It showed a romance that's really perfect that love will really, really conquer all, just like what Noah said, ""It's not easy we have to work for it.""One thing that I always look for in a great movie is the plot. This plot with its twist and turns, curves and bends are really like a roller coaster that you wouldn't know what would happen. I love how they used time to tell the tale. It was also quite refreshing to see a story finished 'till the end.The actors and actresses were really fantastic. Even if they're only playing minor roles it was executed with great care.Also, have to give a very BIG credit to Nick Cassavetes whose efforts really pulled the movie together.

"Less Budget, More Captive version of Titanic","Makes you cry! That's the impression I got after watching this movie. At least 50 from 80 people in the cinema watching this movie cried as soon as the credit title showed up.As the matter in fact, the story is so simple. No surprises in its plot line. The acting is normally good (but they built a strong chemistry). It's Hallmark way of beauty pictures provided to the audience. And I can tell it's a low budget movie. But yet, the film captivates much strongly than the big budget ""Titanic"".It's the heart that would make this film different. This is the kind of film that touches your heart and emotion deeply in a strange way. I can't describe why I give this movie 10 out of 10, but somehow I feel that I must give it.Maybe it's love. Unending, unselfish love that's maintained during 2 hours of this movie.

not real,"In the first part of the movie Noah and Allie were very believable having had a few young loves of my own. Very good scene on the wheel when Noah is holding on to a brace with one hand scaring the be-gebers out of Allie forcing her to go out with him and she says about four times she would, he then says ""alright alright I'll go out with you"" like she was begging him. Funny, very funny. When Allie was forced to leave to go to school the movie kind of went into the tank. First of all didn't Allie ever get the mail? Then we go to the nursing home where Noah reads to her most days and she can remember all of it. How can that be? She does'nt remember her kids but remembers A story being read to her? Then she gets her memory back for a few minutes and they are dancing. She then forgets Again and looks at Noah like he was Satan. Why? He reads to her every day and she does'nt go bonkers when they meet. One good laugh, many tears fall. They then die together. What do they do, strangle each other?

Wow. Just wow...,"Alright, this is by far the best, as well as most moving movie I have ever seen. I'm a 15 year old male, and the first time I watched this movie, I watched it because a ""popular"" girl, at my high school recommended it to me. I wanted to watch it just because of that. However at 2AM when I was finished watching it, I was in tears. Something I've done before with movies, but not commonly. The whole plot of the movie, the characters, the music. It was amazing. It made me feel like a whole new person. I know, that probably sounds like it's impossible, because it's just a movie, but it really did. The exact moment the credits were over, I just started the movie over again. I couldn't help it. There was not one moment in that whole movie where I was bored, or not thinking about the plot. I felt like, I was shown the true meaning of love or something like that.About a month after watching it for the first time, I went out and bought 'The Notebook' the book. For me, that's crazy. I hadn't bought a book, ever before that. I've read a lot, but never bought one for myself. It was even crazier because it was a Literature Romance. Something no one that knew me would've expected. I was expecting a lot from the book, and I got way more than I expected. It was one million times better than the movie, and if this was the best movie I'd ever seen, then the book obviously has potential. The book was a page-turner. I didn't want to sleep, and when I woke up I just wanted to read it. I finished it pretty fast, in about a night and a day. All I did was read it. By the end of the book, I was also full of tears. It was absolutely heartwarming. Two months ago I never would've thought I'd be crying over a book about love. However I was, and the book has helped me through a lot. I know it sounds pretty weird, but it has. It always makes my heart grow, and help me re-believe in true love. I don't know, nor do I want to know what kind of person I would be without 'The Notebook'.Now, since I bought the book written by Nicholas Sparks, I've bought all of his books, as well as ""Leaves of Grass"" by Walt Whitman, which is mentioned in ""The Notebook"" movie, ""The Notebook"" novel, as well as ""The Wedding"", a follow-up to ""The Notebook"". I'm enjoying poetry, nature, and plenty of things I'd never have thought I would before. The Notebook has truly changed my life, and how I will form as an adult.I just truly, from my heart wanted to thank Nicholas Sparks for creating such a wonderful, heartwarming, touching story, and thanking the actors, actresses, and directors for creating such a touching film. It implements a new section into your daily thoughts, and changes your outlook on life. It sounds like a whole lot coming from just a movie\book, but that's because it is a whole lot. And it's all true.Definitely 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

Why others should see The Notebook,"People receive different emotions by watching movies. Some make them cry, some make them laugh, and some fill them with suspense. The Notebook is a movie that combines all of these feelings. It is also a movie that grasps your complete attention from beginning to end. I recommend The Notebook to women of any age because it's a love story filled with mixed emotions and because there is never a dull moment.Many emotions arise while watching this movie. In the beginning you laugh at how Noah tries to sway Allie and never gives up until she finally agrees to go out with him. You then smile when you see how deeply they fall in love. You cry when they have to leave each other. You are filled with suspense when Allie meets another man and gets engaged, but you are left with a smile on your face at the end when Noah and Allie finally get back together.The Notebook is also a movie where there is never a dull moment. Their love for each other keeps your attention throughout the movie as well as the suspense of whether or not they will end up together in the end. Noah and Allie have to overcome many obstacles to be together, but their love gets them through each one.In conclusion, any movie that gives you a series of mixed emotions and grasps your attention from beginning to end is a ""must see."" The Notebook is a perfect example of this type of movie. So, for those of you who have not yet seen The Notebook, I highly recommend you do.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

This movie is great, sad, happy and actually can relate to reality and situations that we have seen in todays life.

A Classic With A Lot Of Class,"There are some films that can't be classified as artistic or commercial... The moment they open they become a classic, such is Nick Kassavetes's Notebook.Maybe it is because of the era it depicts, late thirties of the twentieth century, maybe it is the theme of first love which usually is at first sight, but while watching the film I really forgot that it was made in our times, so believable, so authentic was the ambiance. It seemed that the film had already passed the test of time.Another reason is maybe the naiveness (in the good sense of the word) ,the honesty, the pureness of the characters, both at their old age and while young.In our days , with the sexual revolution and postmodernist approach to life ,where there are no hinders getting in the way of couples, when first comes the sex , before developing an emotional attachment , which sweeps away the mystery and the innocence, it seems that love, like it used to be , exists only in novels and films,the classic ones of course.Films like this make us realize the compromise we have made in our hectic journey towards progress , it is not just the memory of the characters which shakes , ours does too. If the past relationships were doomed by convention ,ours are doomed by this anarchistic liberty which like a strong flow of water makes the flower wither before it blossoms. Films like this evoke a sense of nostalgia for ""the good old days"" , despite of the horrible war and losses , from which the film quickly passes.Casting Ryan Gosling is one of the smartest choices made in a film . His performance stands out the most,after all it is his character that initiates their encounter and pours fuel to the whole faculty of their love.It is his perseverance, his incurable romanticism in believing in what he wants, however impossible it might seem , and Gosling's understated but sensitive and elegant portrayal of Noah,that contributes to the realization of his dream, their dream.Equally impressive are Rachel McAdams , Gena Rowlands and James Garner in their interpretations , which engage us in their story and convince us through the pages of their Notebook , that we need our memories to define who we are , and in spite of everything we've been through, there are pages definitely worth living , reading and remembering.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Enchanting love story,"Who in the world doesn't know about the classic romance film, The Notebook. The movie is based off the very popular Nicolas Sparks novel. The cast includes A list actors and actresses: Gena Rowlands, James Garner, Rachel McAdams, Ryan Gosling, and Joan Allen. The performances by every actor is very skilled and spot on. I loved the chemistry between both Garner and Rowlands and between Gosling and McAdams. Their on screen love really does win the viewer over. The movie brings you into their story and all the complexities of it and makes you care about what happens to them in the end. We see the two fall in love when they're younger and we see them go through many ups and downs, then we see them years later when they're older, and your attention never strays. Not once.

Awesome,"This movie was FANTASTIC!!!!!!!!!!!! It was surely one of the best movies ever made. I never knew that a movie would make me cry as much as the Notebook has. Ryan Gosling (Noah) was gorgeous and an amazing actor. I can't put it into anymore words how wonderful the movie has been. If you read the book The Notebook, and thought that the book was excellent, then you should see the movie, because you won't be sorry. I can continue to say how much I loved the movie, but it won't stand up to how excellent it is. The Notebook is such a heartfelt movie, and the chemistry Ryan and Rachel have on camera as Noah and Allie makes the movie work.

"When things settle in, they click","The Notebook has been considered for many one of the more best selling Nicholas Sparks adaptation films within the last decade and one of the more polarizing romance films. Opening back in 2004, the film was not as much of a hit back then but quickly became to be a bigger film as the years have passed. The first half of the film is quite shaky as we see the introductions of the characters, and the story settling in.We watch it, knowing it must get better and as the second half approaches (about an hour in- once we see Ryan Goslin's character Noah with a beard), the film picks up a lot of momentum and becomes very entertaining and quite a thrilling watch. We can see why this movie has been praised by film goers through the years, though it does have its clich√©s although they do not get too much in the way of the story. Although predictable (as are most love stories), what works about the Notebook is the ending and the way the film is told within it's storytelling.This film has been described by many as ""The Titanic"" of the 2000's, and that may be accurate as far as best selling/romance love adaptation book stories. Overall depending on your expectations, this film may not be as cheesy or lovey as one would expect. The chemistry and performances of the leads, along with the storytelling is what set this film apart from other films of the genre.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

The cheapest and lousiest book based movie ever,"Many would undoubtedly agree that Nicholas Sparks's 1996 bestseller ""The Notebook"" could be deservingly called one of the most touching and beautiful stories ever written. The 2004 movie on the other hand, is an entirely different story. Not venturing out too many details it can only be said that this must be the lousiest attempt at delivering a truly charming story. The plot stands only in a very scarce correlation with the actual one and the shallow characters could not be more remote from the ones depicted in Sparks's story.

A perfect movie,"This is a perfect movie. I am not alone in my affection for this movie (although it is ranked 5.3 by the critics at Rotten Tomatoes and Megacritics, the viewers rank it 7.9 in Trakt and IMdB and Rotten Tomatoes viewers give it an 8.5), so there must be a few of us who feel like this. Do you think critics become too battle weary to see things with the wistful hope of improbable optimism? I'd forotten how young Rachel MacAdams and Ryan Gosling were when they made this movie. These two young Canadians won our hearts as they perfectly inhabited their characters. Their young love was filled with enthusiasm and life, yet, James Garner and Gena Rowlands beautifully displayed love, long lived. I love the writing, the performances, the locations and the music, that haunts us, even after the last scene fades. I'm a romantic that still dreams of endings such as this.

Heart-breaking but great,"The movie begins in 1940 where young and poor Noah (Ryan Gosling) falls in love with rich Allie (Rachel McAdams). Naturally she hates him at first but soon falls in love with him too. However her parents are horrified and keep them apart. Seven years later they meet and she's already set to marry someone else (James Marsters). Can she forget Noah? Also the story has a wrap around featuring an elderly couple (James Garner and Gena Rowlands).At first I hated this film. I disliked the characters and was insulted by the non-stop clich√©s popping up. But, eventually it won me over. The acting was great, the cinematography stunning and the story moved briskly. By the end I was crying my eyes out nonstop. This is a very romantic but heart-breaking movie to watch. Recommended but plenty of tissues handy.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
I absolutely loved this movie,"If you like a movie with a ""story being told"" or a narration, you will love this. Is similar, in that sense, to Fried Green Tomatoes or Big Fish. People make it out to be a tear jerker romance...well, I am one to love those types of movies, but even my husband liked this one. I have been recommending this movie to everyone I talk to. Go rent it, better yet...buy it. I did. Ryan Gosling makes you fall in love with him, Rachel McAdams is beautiful, James Garner is a sweetheart, and Gena Rowlands does an excellent job acting her part. My daughter recognized Rachel from her role in Mean Girls right away. Ryan is definitely an actor to watch for.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
THE EPITOMY OF ROMANCE !!,"I discovered quite by chance that this is currently running in my local cinema and was originally attracted to it by its plot ! I was not disappointed, it was an excellent all-rounder. I am assuming the director had prior knowledge of the films ""You're the Cream in my Coffee"", ""Blue Moon"" and ""Splendor in the Grass"" as this film would appear to include elements and themes from all of those.Picture quality and soundtrack are amazing. I was especially touched by the beautiful photography, the attention paid to lighting effects, the use of slow-motion bird flight, the setting sun. Each scene seems to have been filmed with thoughtfulness and artistic beauty in mind.Although the film clocks in at over two hours, I could not find one boring or slow moment ! Incredible, as I usually prefer shorter films. Of course we can guess from the beginning the correlation between the older couple and the young one, like in ""BLue Moon"" but this film is far more emotional because the idea of illness 'Alzheimer""s"" is introduced. All the actors give a magnificent performance and, as amply stated elsewhere, a large box of Kleenex is necessary to accompany you to the film.It is no use narrating the story, but suffice it to say that this is a HIGHLY ROMANTIC film, on a par with the great classics but not quite as sad as some. Although the sexual scenes are not explicit, they are nevertheless erotic without going over the top ! So beautifully is the whole thing filmed that its purchase on DVD is a must !This is a film for those who are obsessed by passionate deep love and romance. Some viewers may well be able to relate to what happens between Noah and Allie ! It is not a film for lovers of violent or action-packed thrillers ! The violence is present, but in the strength of the love and chemistry between the principal actors. If you are a true romantic at heart you should NOT MISS this film !!!",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Superb - From an Action Fan,"My preferred genres are horror and action, yet I was so invested in this movie that it is undoubtably one of the best movies I've ever seen. I walked in expecting to roll my eyes disappointed, and walked out feeling genuine emotion. There is something different about this movie that is indescribable...unless it is seen first hand. I recommend this movie to anyone - and everyone. You can try as hard as you want to hate this movie because it's a ""chick flick,"" but you will walk away saying, likely because you're afraid to admit more, ""yeah, that was actually pretty good.""",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
A sentimental and predictable movie with a few genuinely touching moments,"After being told time and time again by my female friends to ""watch The Notebook, you'll cry soooo much!"" I finally did it, alone, in the privacy of my own home, so that if it was too terrible I could deny ever having seen it later.It was almost exactly what I expected it to be. Boy from lower class meets girl from upper class, separated by parents, reunited by chance years later, girl has to decide between the man she loved at 17 and her fianc√©e, who represents the world she ""belongs"" in. Sound familiar? It should, it's a plot that's been worn thin through overuse, and a charming performance by Rachel McAdams is not enough to give it new life. Nicholas Sparks, known mostly for for his even greater offender on the sentimental scene, A Walk to Remember, seems more interested in constructing a tale that entertains due to its predictability and tried-and-true appeal, not its originality or the freshness of dialogue, setting, or character. Despite showing a few impressive chops, Ryan Gosling fails to break out of the stock underdog role, and achieves his distinctive moments only during the moments where he's pitted against McAdams in their frequent fights, not during the love scenes themselves.The real charm of this movie, for me, was the structure that the story is set against. An old man reads the story of the two young lovers to an old woman suffering for the last stages of Alzheimer's, a routine that we are given to understand happens every day. This elderly act of love is a thousand times sweeter and more convincing than any part of the story he retells--though Sparks can't resist tossing in further cheap sentiment by constant references to an expected ""miracle"" that will cure his companion's disease.Technically, the movie is impressive. The sets and directing are generally above par, but cannot save the movie from being a typical chick-flick tear jerker. It has redeeming qualities, certainly, but after watching it I felt the hype it's received as ""a perfect and enduring love story"" was not fully deserved. In a few years, it will still have its fans, but it will be regaled to two copies in Blockbuster's that get rented perhaps once a month, replaced by similar movies that are again declared ""beautiful and heartwarming"". The acclaim it's earned popularly is, in my opinion, only earned because the lovers of this film loved the story before they even entered the theatre, and were thrilled to get exactly what they expected.",,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Awesome! There hasn't been anything as good since Titanic!,"Some people drink, others jump out of airplanes¬Ö I go to the movies to escape. I'm 24 and I absolutely loved this film, I haven't liked a movie this much since Titanic. I initially intended to see it but was late to the theater and saw Dodge Ball instead. Being the disappointment that was hopped on over to Notebook. I was the only guy there initially until other two others showed up with their girl friends. I'm sure the two mothers behind me with their teenaged daughters wondered where my girl friend was and when no one showed up wondered if I was playing for the 'other team.' I'm definitely not but I'm a sucker for feasible story lines and period films, and this one totally rocked. Rachel McAdams, whom I never noticed in Mean Girls or The Hot Chick, was absolutely beautiful in this movie, my goodness!

This movie is romantic,When i first heard of this movie i thought oh great another of those boring romantic movies where the two people fall in love but this is more than that. This is taken in 1940 where two young teens fall in love but then separate cause Allie is going to New York to go to school. Then seven years has passed and Allie has a new boyfriend well is engaged. Allie goes back home to find her first love and fall in love with him all over again. I especially like the lake sequence with the ducks. Overall they ended up but in a good way cause it kept you thinking who will she stay with Noah or Lon. It is also a good film cause Duke's (Noah) love Allie can't remember anything and he has to read her the book of there lives so she can come back to him. Overall i give it a 10/10. The best performance is by Rachel McAdams. She is a great actor and i hope to see much more of her.,10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

My Girlfriend and I loved it,I went to see this movie with my girlfriend after she had told me she read the book. She said she read the book in one sitting so I figured it had to be good. After the first 15 or 20 minutes of the move I was totally involved in the story and I thought that James Garner and Gena Rowlands were outstanding in their roles. I have always liked both of them and have watched Mr. Garner on television since I was young. This was one of the best movies I have ever seen and when the DVD recently came out I went immediately and got my copy and so did my girlfriend. I hope to see more movies like this soon. There are so many negative TV shows and movies nowadays that it was quite refreshing to see one with a positive theme and one that promotes love instead of hate and violence.,10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
"Excellent movie, especially acting by Gosling and McAdams",Saw this movie yesterday and was amazed by the acting job of Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams. From the moment they hit the screen to the end both did a fantastic job. The script was a gem for both to work with. They were natural together and played off each other well. The only problem was I felt they did seem to get tired towards the end of the movie. There roles required a lot of energy and perhaps it was hard to sustain it. The rest of the cast was wonderful though Joan Allen seemed flat. The script was well written and locations beautiful. Costume design is especially noteworthy. Though not a 10 the movie was extremely enjoyable to watch -- especially because of Gosling and McAdams.,8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
A Complete Tear Jerker,"I read the book before I saw this movie and I have to say that I thought it was very well done. The acting in particular was very well done. McAdams and Gosling had undeniable chemistry that really made the characters believable. Most of the people I talked to could relate on some level to the characters and their relationships with either each other or their parents. However, to enjoy the movie you really have to be in the mood for one of those sappy-romantic type movies. Most people seemed to enjoy it though. I don't think there was a dry eye in the theatre, including all the teenage guys sitting around me. It was heartwrenching, but beautiful and I think the actors and the director truly did a spectacular job.

A Masterpiece of Infidelity and Muddy Romance,"Oh, The Notebook. The so-called ""greatest love story of all time."" I mean, who doesn't love a heartwarming tale about a woman juggling two men and making poor life choices while everyone swoons over rain-soaked kisses? This movie is a cultural phenomenon among women, and I can't help but wonder... why?First, let's address the elephant in the room: SHE CHEATED. Yes, our sweet Allie, the epitome of true love and devotion, literally steps out on her perfectly fine fianc√©. But it's okay, right? Because Noah built her a house. Apparently, infidelity is super romantic when there's handcrafted woodwork involved.And then there's Noah, played by Ryan Gosling. Oh, the poster boy for toxic persistence. He hangs off a Ferris wheel to get a date and spends years pining over a girl who left him behind. But hey, nothing says ""healthy relationship"" like borderline obsession and zero communication.The film's big selling point? That rain scene. Sure, it looks nice-two people kissing passionately in a storm. But let's be real, they're probably catching pneumonia while we pretend it's romantic. And the iconic line, ""It wasn't over! It still isn't over!"" Well, buddy, maybe it should have been.To top it all off, we have the heart-wrenching ending. A beautiful metaphor for... guilt? Regret? Manipulating your dying partner into believing your problematic relationship was magical? Who knows, but apparently sobbing into tissues makes people think it's cinematic gold.In conclusion, The Notebook is a film that's not about true love but about nostalgia, bad decisions, and the triumph of red flags. Ladies love it because it's ""romantic,"" but I guess we're just ignoring the whole cheating part because Gosling's dreamy stare is distracting. Bravo, Nicholas Sparks-you've created a masterpiece of emotional manipulation disguised as romance.",3.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

Not only was the Notebook great because of what it was about, but what also contributed to how great it was were the characters. The producer could not have chosen a better couple; Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams make the perfect couple and are brilliant together. (James Garner and Gena Rowlands were also great.)In the movie, when Allie Hamilton (McAdams)first met Noah Calhoan (Gosling) she did not think much of him. However Noah was struck by Allie's beauty, I would say it was love at first sight for Noah. Throughout the movie Noah tries getting a date with Allie but she plays hard to get. Noah however finally sneaks to a date with Allie and after that night, they got to know each other better, Allie and Noah were unseparateable. Unfortunately, Noah was not the man Allie's parents wanted their daughter to marry. Many, many more things that were happy, that were sad and made me cry occurred after that.

Wonderful love story,"""The Notebook"" is a beautifully written and filmed love story ranks right on top along with ""Terms of Endearment"" and ""Love Story"".

Their ""love/hate start as a couple will be identifiable to many, I am sure. It could be compared to a present day Romeo and Juliet.

The movie grabbed me, and made me feel like part of the story. However, what really separated this from other romances, is that it was a story WITHIN a story. The viewer is treated to two spectacular stories, side by side, each of which is necessary for the powerful effect that the movie creates.

Passionate and sweeping,"Once every generation there is a romantic movie that just works. In the 80s it was ""Somewhere in Time"". In the 2000s it was ""the Notebook"". There is an epic sweep of time and passion that feels real. The leads are convincing and moving. Rachel McAdams is a luminous expressive actress and every emotion of joy and sadness is shown on her face. Ryan Gosling's understated passion is a perfect counterpoint to Rachel's performance and the chemistry between them is undeniable. He is right for the underdog part. The niceness of the characters is refreshing. Supporting cast is well chosen from Joan Allen to James Marsden. The older characters are good played by James Garner and Gena Rowlands although they look nothing like the younger ones.The music used and score are appropriate for the time. The filming on location in South Carolina is beautiful and evocative adding much to the charm of the movie.It isn't a perfect movie - some of the dialog isn't well written. Although the past and present story lines are what makes this story unique, some of the flashing back and forth is distracting and the dementia is a little overwhelming. The class difference thing is a bit clich√©d. But in the end it doesn't matter. It's not just the ultimate chick flick date night movie. It works as a whole and remains the most poignant and deeply felt of the Nicholas Sparks stories.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Love for the characters provides real emotion to the romantic drama,"A love story for the ages; a weepy romantic drama; a timeless love story. All the exhausted clich√©s apply, but ""The Notebook"" manages to turn them into something substantial‚Äîemotionally at least, if not intellectually. Everything in this movie is beautiful and it's easy to get wrapped up into the story.Noah (Ryan Gosling) loves Allie (Rachel McAdams). That's basically the entire story, but conflicts arise when Allie's parents insist he's not good enough for her, and Noah has to spend the rest of his life winning her back. I love both Noah and Allie. Allie, because she's the type of girl that every girl can realistically see themselves as; she's emotional, but smart and passionate, and adorable in every way. And Noah, because he has this boyish charm that he never loses. Gosling has this incredible ability to play men at any and every point in their lives.Because the characters are just so captivating, the story is able to invoke emotion. You'll fall in love when they do, you'll be heart-broken when they are, and you'll cry when they do. ""The Notebook"" is beautifully shot, beautifully told, and most importantly, beautifully acted. And it's for those reasons that it is able to rise above the rather tired and painfully predictable plot. You won't even notice that because you'll be crying and falling in love.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Fantastic,i was given this film as a prezzie. i wasn't really sure if it would be any good and thought it was probably just another soppy movie. how could i have been so wrong? the performances were fantastic and heart rendering and left me crying for a good 20 mins afterwards. it doesn't fail to have me weeping even after the 4th time of watching it. this film is a must see! i urge u to see it because it is fantastic. Ryan Goslings portrayal of Noah is so moving i was in love with him by the end of the movie. this film is perfection personified. please watch it! you are also not short on eye candy with Ryan and the gorgeous James Marsden. hmmm. i now order you to watch it!go! if i could id give it 100 out of 10!,10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
This movie brought to you by big business Kleenex!,"I am of the utmost belief that Kleenex was a sponsor of this film. It has been a very long time since Hollywood released a ""true"" tearjerker film, and I know that Kleenex couldn't help but try to get a piece of the action. I know that my wife went through at least ten Kleenex by the time this film was over and she had read the book. Imagine what it would be like for those that didn't see this film coming. I honestly feel they could go through a whole box. Ironically, and corporately minded, I went through no Kleenex as I watched this film, but instead found my mind wandering and trying at any opportunity to search for any chemistry between our lovebird characters. From Garner and Rowlands to Gosling and McAdams, there was this sensation that they were nothing more than actors playing their part instead of the feeling of true love erupting from the screen. Adding to this mess was a mixed bag of story lines that seemed as if Cassavetes was trying to make straight lines out of circles. While this wasn't a horrible film by any means, The Notebook was perfect and its flaws cut very deep into this sad story.While I think Sparks' characters in his book are probably much better than in this story, I still wish he would have pushed harder for better actors or a bit more story. There definitely seemed to be a lacking on both of these ends that hurt the overall feel of the film. James Garner is old, and that was about the only thing that he had going for him. Rowlands I can give some credit towards, but strangely I couldn't see these two working together. Garner's passion towards Rowlands seems scripted, while there definitely wasn't anything between Rowlands and Garner. It felt as if Garner was working too hard while Rowlands just didn't place any effort. The Kleenex effect only occurred between these two characters, in my opinion, because they were old, and that seems to strike a chord with all of us. Perhaps it is the grandparent effect or the fear of getting to that point in our lives, I felt that tears were shed near the end of the film because of their age, not their acting ability. The same can be said for McAdams and Gosling. McAdams did a decent job with the material given, but the slipping accent of Ryan Gosling was inexcusable and disturbing. Gosling was completely miscast in this film. I don't know if he was Cassavetes first choice for the role, but he just didn't capture the emotions that were deeply rooted in this film. He read lines, gave some expression, but that was all. I saw Ryan Gosling playing the character and not Noah on screen. His eyes are what hurt him the most. They just didn't seem to fit with what the character was trying to convey. Each time the camera moved to his eyes, the film lost more credibility. To build a great film that this could have been you need to staple it with strong players, sadly, this did not happen with The Notebook. Feathers trying to be paperweights instead hold down this story.Then we have the story. Sparks has a great imagination, and this story seemed like it would make a great story to tell on the written page, but not in film. There were too many loose ends that were not covered or given enough respect for me in this film. Allie's parents are one of them. Allie's dad was hysterical looking as I kept hoping that I would see him whip out some Dapper Dan somewhere in the film. Allie's Mom, Joan Allen, is not given enough time to defend herself and her climactic moment at the end seems a bit forced and boring than emotional. We don't have enough information on her or this other character to really care about her big scene, instead it feels just like ""filler"". There should have been more with Sam Shepard, who conveniently did not make it till the end of the film. It felt as if he was written away because nobody knew what to do with him. The same can be said of James Marsden's character who arrives, conquers, and leaves with no emotional response. With many of these moments I felt we were given the short, short, short version instead of the emotional powerhouse this could have been. The final scene that I found myself laughing at immensely was the entire ""Noah going to war"" bit. The emotional scene during this brief interlude was completely forced and implausible. I needed more during this moment to have my heart wretched out of me, and not just a scene to tie up any loose ends. Cassavetes could handle this film, I think he just chose to throw too many elements into the fire that he could not fully develop, which hurt him in the long run.Overall, this film could have reached new levels, but instead cheapened itself to cater to those with low emotional control (the weepy) and lovers. Everyone in love has their own story to tell that would probably make another person tear up, but that is what makes it your own. Cassavetes did not build a strong film with The Notebook, but instead used common clich√©d Hollywood techniques to give the audience what they were hoping for, shallow characters that will make you cry. Well, if you are looking for a film that literally cuts the drama and gives you the tears, this would be the film for you. To everyone else, I say skip it. There are better dramas that will burst your tear ducts longer than this one!Grade: ** out of *****",3.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
