Can supposedly not live up to the high expectations,"'Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace'. A movie, which has a difficult standing in the fan community. For me, not understandable, because I really like the movie and it's a successful prelude to the formerly new trilogy.Admittedly, the movie has weaknesses. First of all, the hair-raising attempt to explain what 'the force' is. Qui-Gon tries to explain to Anakin that there are Midi-Chlorianes which are the basis and the reason for everything. Anakin replies that he doesn't understand what Qui-Gon is trying to explain to him. Thereupon Qui-Gon lets it rest and the scene is over. Of course, you wonder what that was all about. So either you explain it correctly or you leave it completely. But so the whole thing seems really unnecessary.The entire storyline is unnecessarily complex and I have to admit that I didn't really understand it. You do have the feeling that you can understand the motivation of the respective characters, but the entire political plot is not 100% clear. It seems like an overambitious attempt to get seriousness into the movie.Jar Jar Binks. Here, you realize that the movie was made for a younger audience. Jar Jar is an attempt to be funny in a childish and clumsy way. It wouldn't have needed it. However, I didn't find it really disturbing either.These are points of criticism, but they only bother me to a limited extent. Episode I has so many strong moments. The whole act of introducing Anakin, the way Tatooine is portrayed, the really well staged pot race. All these moments know how to convince.The chemistry between Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan is brilliant. And while we're on the subject of characters, Darth Maul is for me one of the best antagonists there is. The few scenes with him manage to build a mystical aura around him. The fight between these three characters is outstanding as well.Episode I is hard to compare to the first Star Wars movies. And it is precisely this comparison that is Episode I's undoing. The movie were made at a different time, have a different tone and of course it can't be denied that this movie was also made for a younger audience.For me, Episode I did what Episode IV did for many others. To ignite enthusiasm for the Star Wars universe.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Only For A True Fan,"What everyone remembers fondly from this movie is Liam Neeson and Ewan McGregor as Qui-Gon Jinn and Obi Wan Kenobi, Darth Maul and their climatic duel. Sadly, there isn't more than a few minutes of Maul and instead we are given Jar Jar Binks and Jake Lloyd as a needlessly young Anakin. Along with these characters the movie is burdened by a general tone that's directed at children and an over reliance on still developing CGI technology.It looks bad, it sounds bad(kudos to the actors who make this dialouge sound good) and the best aspects are too brief. The Phantom Menace has been lapidated by audiences and its kind of understandable: passionate Star Wars fans can look past the flaws but to the average viewer it can be very offputting.But hey, look at what you got now.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Underrated,"Let's get it out of the way here. Jar Jar Binks is really annoying and outside of ""there's always a bigger fish"" I don't find even a single one of his scenes funny. Outside of that, he contributes practically nothing of value to the story (he tells Qui-Gon how to find the Gungans but that's it.) Almost any criticism levied against Jar Jar is one with which I agree. (Yes, I know he was a character created to appeal to kids.)Midichlorians were an entirely unnecessary introduction though they're not as frustrating as Positive Probability Ions.But the rest of the movie, I like. Palpatine, the Sith, Darth Maul, the Jedi Counci, Qui-Gon, even the child characters. (The Rule of Two is pointless and arbitrary but I can accept it.Does this movie have flaws? Yes not more glaring flaws than those of its predecessors. Is this the best Star Wars movie ever? No but it's still pretty good.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

A solid but flawed addition to the Star Wars Saga,"Well, after waiting 16 years for his next installment,  George has given us ""The Phantom Menace"".  As a Star Wars fan I got what I expected - another chance to immerse myself in the Star Wars universe - a film whose sole purpose is essentially escapism.  But as a movie fan, and judging it as I would any other movie, I frankly feel mildly disappointed.  Any movie that's made can always be improved upon but I feel that this SHOULD have been better.  Firstly the good points :1)  The visuals are stunning - a lot of love and hard work has quite obviously gone into the effects and the people involved can quite rightly be proud of their work2)  All the performances by the main cast were good.  Particularly Natalie Portman and Pernilla August.3)  The Pod Race was exciting and amusing.4)  The final sabre duel was quite fantastic : Darth Maul prowling up and down like a caged tiger was a particularly excellent touch - it added real tension and anticipation to the scene.5)  The music as always was magnificent.  The Star Wars saga would lose much of its charm and intensity without Williams' scores.And now the negatives :1)  The pacing was too fast in parts!  The first half hour of the film just left me cold - you weren't led into the story.  You were dumped straight into the action.  On paper I'm sure the first half hour looked fantastic but I found myself sitting in the theatre going - 'hey, great special effect shot there!'  I wasn't involved in the story and the scenes lacked tension and danger.2)  The film only truly started for me on reaching Tatooine.  I finally got a chance to get to know the characters.  However there still was not enough character development in the film as a whole.  For example,  Obi Wan had nothing to do or say throughout the movie except flash his light sabre around from time-to-time.  Who is Obi Wan???  After seeing the film I'm none the wiser.  And the final sabre duel (good as it was) would have been infinitely better had the relationship between Qui-Gon and Obi Wan been explored past the mere mentor-apprentice motif.  The final sabre duel lacked emotional involvement as a consequence.3)  Why did they make Jar-Jar so incomprehensible??  I found myself becoming annoyed at having to strain to understand his nonsensical utterings! (Having said that, he wasn't as annoying as I'd been led to expect)  Why George used easily identifiable racial accents for his alien characters completely puzzled me. It just shows a lack of imagination!4)  Not enough Darth Maul.5)  What's with the biological exposition on the Force!  Was that necessary? The first three films pointed to links between the Force and genetics but I don't need tiresome cold scientific explanations as to the Force's origin, thank you very much!  It just ruins the mystique.6)  Can we have less of the mindless gaffes that occur in the final battle scenes (You know the ones that save the day!)  Its an insult to the audience's intelligence (In a full theatre I swear I didn't see a single soul who looked under sixteen! - has George forgotten about the original fans).  In the original trilogy there was none of this cringeful embarrassing material (Ewoks excepted!!)Well I think I'll stop there.  To summarise : a good movie that could have been a whole lot better.  Perhaps there was too much story to cover in two hours?  In which case the plot should have been shortened on the adage that ""less is more"".  I've always thought that episode one was always going to be the lamest of the new films so I await the next installment with anticipation and hope .....",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Beautiful Opening to a Beautiful Saga!!,"Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace, is a beautiful opening to perhaps one of the most beautiful space sagas of all-time!! This was George Lucas' attempt to set the stage, and place the characters that would eventually lead to the characters that we grew to know and love in the late 1970's and early 1980's. Now expectations for this film were EXTREMELY high when it was coming out in early 1999, and not everyone liked this film but this reviewer was not one of those people. I was one of the the people that loved it. For the most part, Lucas was given a blank check by Twentieth Century Fox to make this film and if you are to watch it again and just take in the landscapers, settings, costumes, technology, you will see the grand vision that Lucas had behind The Phantom Menace. He did not have these funds and technology at his disposal for his first three Star Wars films. This time he simply did not spare any expense in the prequel films. Israeli-American actress, and Academy Award Winner Natalie Portman changes through numerous costumes in the film, one better than the the other as does her entourage in costumes that are not that far off in terms of looks or expenses from Portman's. I can understand how some fans might be upset at how there are some slow scenes in the film, but it was important for Lucas to set up future action scenes - not to mention future movies - such as the scene where Qui-Gon Jinn (played admirably by Liam Neeson) takes a blood sample from young Anakin Skywalker (Jake Lloyd) to get a midi-chlorian count (a Jedi blood count - something that lets Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan - played very well by Ewan McGregor - know he has Jedi potential). Lucas makes up for this though with outstanding action scenes later in the movie like the desert fight scene between the black clad ninja-like Sith warrior Darth Maul (Ray Park) and Qui-Gon in which the two clash sabers for a couple minutes before Qui-Gon wisely jumps to his ship and the safety of space!! The fact that Star Wars was back, and it was done in a satisfying way that set up future movies was good enough for me!! It had memorable characters, and while not all of these characters survived, they made an imprint on the Star Wars universe that Star Wars fans still cherish today!! Great action, fair acting, good costuming, good sound editing, great soundtrack by legend and genius John Williams, good direction and writing by God and legend George Lucas made this the most artistically beautiful and fun movie of the Star Wars saga!! 8 out of 10 stars!!",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Visually a marvel to look at, disappointing in terms of story","Star Wars: Episode 1- The Phantom Menace is definitely worth a watch, but I do think it is one of the weaker movies of the Star Wars saga. I will admit I wasn't expecting much after reading some very negative reviews on IMDb, but I do think this particular instalment did in some ways exceed my expectations and disappointed as well. On a visual and technical level, it looks absolutely fantastic, with splendid special effects, stunning cinematography and fine scenery and costumes. The script is fairly decent, perhaps lacking the sophistication of Empire Strikes Back or New Hope, but does have some memorable lines. The action is constantly exhilarating, and Darth Maul, well played by Ray Park is a very good villain. Of course though, Darth Vader is better. Most of the performances are very good, especially Natalie Portman as Queen Padma who looked stunning and Jake Lloyd as Anakin Skywalker who shone with his confident charm. And Jar Jar Binks is okay on the most part, and you have to love Yoda. And the music score by John Williams was outstanding, definitely one of his best works. The quality of sound and direction are also impressive. However, there were things about this film that did disappoint. One is despite the awesome visuals, strong music score and good characters, the story never quite distinguished itself. It did take a while to get going, and when it did try to get going and you could tell it wanted to, it was further disadvantaged by the uneven pacing. Liam Neeson is a fine actor, his performances in Kinsey and Schindler's List are proof of that, and I do like Ewan McGregor. But as Qui-Gon Jin and Obi Wan Kenobi, both stars give unusually wooden performances, and at times looked even embarrassed. And as I said, the pacing is very uneven, there are some slow moments, and one or two scenes felt rushed. All in all, maybe disappointing for fans of the saga, but it cannot be denied that visually it is an accomplishment. 7/10 Bethany Cox",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
A perspective after all the hype has died down,"Lucas may have problems as a director and writer, but I've always thought that those flaws are balanced by his great storytelling ability. The problem with ""The Phantom Menace"" is that he simply has no story to tell. The film merely adds an introductory chapter to a story that has already been told, and stretches it out into a two-hour movie. It is no accident that prequels of this kind are rare. They are very difficult to make properly. And apparently he's just not a sophisticated enough filmmaker to pull it off.For one thing, this project is limited by the fact that anyone familiar with the first trilogy knows the story's outcome, and it therefore lacks some of the suspense associated with a gradually unfolding saga. More importantly, however, this situation leaves Lucas with very little freedom as a storyteller. It also encourages him to gloss over key events; because their outcome is a foregone conclusion, he forgets to bring them to life.For example, we know there will eventually be a romance between Anakin and Padme. So Lucas has the two characters meet here and--surprise, surprise--they seem to like each other. Their developing friendship isn't portrayed that clearly, and their motivations for becoming close aren't explained. Because Lucas fails to make scenes like these believable, we can't help being conscious of how he's manipulating the plot in his effort to connect the two trilogies. Another good example of this problem is Anakin's portrayal as a potential Jedi. There doesn't appear to be anything about this kid remotely out of the ordinary, even though the other characters keep talking like there is. Our only reason for thinking he's special is that the plot requires it.If the story fails to be engaging, it is because we never see the important events. Lucas makes a fatal error in not showing what's happening on Naboo, the small planet whose capture is the focus of the plot. Numerous atrocities are supposedly being committed against the planet's inhabitants, but we only know about this because the characters on screen refer to the events, usually rather woodenly.The deadpan performances are a problem in themselves, but they only highlight our lack of involvement in the story. Think of Han Solo sweating in fear, then think of the emotional vacuums passing for characters in this film. Whenever any of the characters do express emotion, as in the scene where Anakin and his mom part, it still seems awfully restrained. Somehow, Lucas manages to keep the emotional reactions of his characters to a minimum, which gives the film an almost mechanical feel.It's true that ""A New Hope"" never showed Alderaan's inhabitants, but we still could feel the tragedy of the planet's destruction through the horrified reactions of Princess Leia and Obi Wan. Moreover, there were many other involving events which we witnessed directly, such as the slaying of rebels at the beginning; the capture and torture of the princess; and the murder of Luke's foster parents. Furthermore, the major plot elements were intriguing in and of themselves. They weren't there merely to show us how they were to be linked to later events, which seems to be the case with the new film.I suspect that Lucas was not as concerned in the first trilogy with what had to happen later in the story and was therefore able to focus his attention on the events at hand. The weakest segment was ""Return of the Jedi,"" which had the task of bringing the story to an end. Only then did Lucas start to show signs of forcing plot points. In ""The Phantom Menace,"" he gets so bogged down in the task of bringing his story from point A to point B that he ends up with only the bare bones of a plot, and none of it comes alive.This is especially true of the characterization. In the old trilogy, characters like Yoda and Han reveal distinct personalities in their first few minutes on screen. This film goes for more than two hours and the characters, including the familiar ones, come off vague and nondescript. We aren't given much of a chance to experience their personalities in the way they interact. We must take Qui Gon's word for it when he describes Obi Wan as ""headstrong."" What's most odd is that the cartoons seem better developed than the humans. The scenes where Qui Gon negotiates with the birdlike slave-owner Watto are amusing and well-done--probably the movie's best scenes aside from the stunning action sequences--but they can't hold a candle to the constant interactions throughout the first trilogy.One thing I cannot do is accuse the film of lacking creativity. The design of the creatures, the technologies, and the planets is impressive. Watching the film is sort of like reading a children's book that isn't very good but abounds with beautiful illustrations. There is certainly a ""wow"" factor in the movie's visuals, but the effect of it is short-lived.I get irked when I hear fans talk as though the ""Star Wars"" movies were never about anything beyond special effects. While the inventive visuals are part of what made the originals so revolutionary, they're not what made the films so fun to watch. And in no way can they explain the trilogy's continuing popularity today. After all, many of the original effects look primitive by today's standards, and their novelty has certainly worn off. Only an enduring and compelling storyline could have allowed the first three films to become the classics they're almost universally acknowledged to be.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Love this film,"Honestly I don't get it why so many people hate this movie I can understand it is a bit too long but its not the weakest in the series, the weakest one in the series would have to be episode 2 Attack of the Clones, having too much romance in it. But I think this one is a lot more better then episode 2 in many ways. And also I think Jar Jar Binks is a rather underrated character I know he can be annoying at times but he did play a large role in this film which fans are missing the point. The pod race is problay the best scene in this whole film as it was rather enjoyable to watch over and over again on youtube. Soundtrack is amazing and very well done for this movie. I know some people hate this movie just because of one character but come on give this movie another chance it will surprised you in many ways.overall Episode 1 is rather underrated and needs another chance8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Quite good; not perfect, but good","With all the voices and opinions and critical ravings about The Phantom Menace, I am sure that one more voice weighing in ain't gonna make that much of a ripple.  But I am a committed fan (in the sense of being devoted, not insane), and I feel the need at least to declare publicly my admiration for Lucas' latest work, and also a few of my concerns.Overall, Episode One ranks above Episode Six, about par with Episode Four, but certainly nowhere near the grandeur and wit of Episode Five. Phantom Menace reminds me of something someone said of Citizen Kane: A hollow masterpiece. PM is technically brilliant, yet it is so technically brilliant that it lacks a certain ""human"" warmth.  To me, the best moments were those intimate, interpersonal moments--Padme giving Anakin a blanket, Qui-Gon placing his hands on Anakin's shoulders in the Jedi temple, and ESPECIALLY all those moments with Shmi Skywalker, Anakin's mother.In an interview in Premiere Magazine, Liam Neeson gave a telling anecdote that illustrates my point. First, he noted that Lucas was reticent to give the actors any motivation for lines, expressions, or anything.  In other words, Lucas simply expected the actors to say lines devoid of emotional content, as if the post-production could somehow invest emotional motivation. Neeson revealed that it took him a long time to convince Lucas to allow Qui-Gon to place a hand on Shmi's shoulder after he convinces her to allow him to take Anakin away to Coruscant. That hand on the shoulder was probably the BEST moment in that film, a sign of human connection in a swirling clash of galactic politics gone awry.Traces of post-production fiddling is evidenced most forcefully with Jake Lloyd's Anakin. Watch carefully his scenes at the dinner table, sitting with Qui-Gon at night, and saying goodbye to his mother. Those scenes were clearly doctored in post-production; I believe Lucas took different takes of Lloyd saying lines and splicing those with Pernilla August's. Pay special attention to Anakin after Shmi says, ""He can help you, he was meant to help you."" Anakin's face is clearly digitally manipulated to turn sideways. The first time I noticed it (it was the fourth time I've seen the film) I was taken aback. It was so blatant I began to wonder what other bits were modified that way.On the plus side: Lucas can weave a wonderfully rich narrative tapestry. I love that all this begins with a trade dispute. A trade dispute! Complete with procedural wranglings in a galactic senate rife with corruption and bureaucracy (watch for the cameo appearance of Spielberg's ETs) and a sinister Darth Sidious pulling the political strings. It's the perfect smokescreen to disguise the rise of an evil empire. Every step of the plot has the look of careful craftsmanship; every twist and turn of the plot had relevance.The costumes are outstanding, especially Queen Amidala's Asian-influenced wardrobe.  John Williams has certainly outdone himself with the soundtrack, particularly ""Duel of the Fates,"" which introduces choral voices into the Star Wars musical repertoire, ominous voices that sometimes hiss and sometimes howl the forboding Sanskrit text. The production design and cinematography (both real and CGI) create vistas of unparalleled beauty and richness: from the Italianate arches and domes on Naboo, to the art nouveau-inspired underwater air-globes of the Gungans, to the dramatic cityscapes of Coruscant. I can see Academy Awards next year for all these achievements . . .Despite its many drawbacks, I am drawn continually to rewatch The Phantom Menace: for its artistry, for its lines (""There's always a bigger fish""), for those rare human moments, and to soak in this latest addition to the Star Wars text. Yes, the wrapper might be a tad bit flashier than the present inside, but its a gift given with a lot of heart and the best of intentions.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Let's stop playing games - bad is bad,"The main line of defence seems to be: lighten up, it's just entertainment / just a kid's movie / just a special effects flick.  Pausing awhile to note that people who run this line of defence have all but conceded that the film is, in fact, bad, let's take these points one by one - shall we?As entertainment it's poor.  Dialogue is flat and perfunctory (don't expect to be dazzled by repartee); the story lacks the beauty of the first Star Wars film and the tension of the second ... and then there's the magical `character development' everyone complains about.  We must distinguish character development from character delineation.  The former is nice, but the latter is absolutely essential, and it's the latter that's missing from `The Phantom Menace'.  Jar Jar, the young Obi Wan, Darth Maul, Armidala, Annakin - all are scarcely characters at all, and are very difficult to get enthused about.  Jar Jar in particular is a collection of mannerisms, nothing more.  This lack of character doesn't just prevent the film from becoming the darling of the intellectuals - it makes it dull.  There are hundreds more entertaining films.  Only those people who entered the cinema carrying plastic light sabers, grimly determined to enjoy themselves, failed to notice this.It's a kid's movie.  Well, yes, in a sense - but not a good sense.  Good children's movies form a proper subset of good movies - simply because adults have access to all childhood emotions and desires, but not vice versa.  So in one sense a `kid's movie' is just a movie that can be understood and apperaciated by children (as well as adults).  Is this a kid's movie in that sense?  Maybe.  But it's also a kid's movie in the bad sense: it's deeply witless, and inexperienced children might - I say, MIGHT - fail to notice just how witless it is.  Children may - I say, MAY - ignore the fact that Jar Jar Binks is a deeply irritating non-character because he is all colour and movement and he speaks funny.  Is this really all we want?Special effects.  These aren't so hot, either.  George Lucas has fallen in love with computers and failed to notice that his digital animals don't move at all in the way that real animals move - worse still, they don't move like any kind of physical object at all.  Nor do most of the alleged physical objects.  Compare the trundling white juggernaut at the start of `Star Wars' - a convincingly solid model - with the insubstantial collection of pixels that darts past us at the start of `The Phantom Menace'.  The special effects have actually deteriorated, and to make matters worse, there are more of them.So the defence that `The Phantom Menace' is allowed to be a poor movie because it really wasn't trying to be something great in the first place, just won't wash.  Especially so, given the ludicrous claims George Lucas has arrogantly made, again and again.  So Jar Jar Binks is the first digitally created main character?  Rubbish - the dragon in `Dragonheart' predates it (and, one might add, is at the very least a genuine character).  So George Lucas is pioneering a new kind of filming-making, more like painting and less like photography, than the old?  Absolute twaddle - Walt Disney did THAT in the 1930s.  I'll tell you what IS new.  Never before has there been so much sizzle, and so little sausage.",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Don't Get High In Your Own CGI...,"Unlike most people,I actually quite like the plots of the prequels;I think the political intrigue and the way Emperor Palpatine gains control of the senate,is clever in the way it mirrors real world despots and it helps add an air of realism which is an important and underrated quality in sci-fi/fantasy films.However,none of that can really make up for the films many faults:the CGI is excessive,cheap looking and cartoonish,the acting way below standard and the script wooden and awkward.Only Darth Maul and his two-on-one lightsaber duel reaches the levels of entertainment we've come to expect from the Star Wars universe.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Despite Being A Let Down, It Does Have Some Plus Points To It","My eldest son recently bought the bluray steel books, so I'm going to be sat watching them for the first time in years. If I catch any of the prequels on TV, I will usually leave them in and then sit and watch the end, usually paying more attention to 3 than the previous 2.After watching the much hated on first movie, I found 6 plus points of The Phantom Menace. Liam Neeson as Qui Gon, Duel Of Fates, Darth Maul and his Lightsabre, Natalie Portman gives her best performance in the trilogy, the end battle and even though it ran too long, and he never could have won with all that happened, the Pod Race.I'm also surprised no other movie has hit on Natalie Portman and Kiera Knightley looking so alike too.The negatives are some awful dialogue (OK all Star Wats movies have awful dialogue, but this takes the biscuit!!) ""Are you an angel?"" And in fact anything Anakin says, especially during the final battle are especially bad. It's not Jake Lloyds fault, I think he is fine. It's Lucas who have him the cringe worthy words. Speaking of the final battle.... An alleged experienced pilot like Anakin pressed two buttons (starting his spaceship and activating auto pilot) looking for the trigger to the gun, before he actually grabs the obvious control!! Most of the movie is about federation tax (Yawn) there are some serious plot holes (why is technology more advanced than in the previous three movies, which are set in the future?? What happened to the blockade of the planet?? Why were Qui Gon and Padme still with Anakin when they hear about the sand storm) we don't see the Jedi do anything except destroy droids till the end. Terrance Stamp is woefully underused, and it definitely needs some trimming here and there, do we really need all the repeated reaction shots (like when Padme reveals she is the Queen) and one of the biggest sins for me is, Darth Maul is a real bad ass, and they kill him off in the the first movie (and would he really just stand there and let Obi Wan flip over him, instead of slicing him in half??) What a waste.I'll state here I don't hate Jar Jar, mainly because both of my kids were fans of his growing up. So my opinion of him has softened over the years.Oh and Jar Jar actually shoots more droids accidentally, than all the stormtroopers added together in the previous 3 movies.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Greed can be a very powerful ally.,"Star Wars Episode 1: The Phantom Menace is written, produced and directed by George Lucas and stars Liam Neeson, Ewan McGregor, Natalie Portman, Jake Lloyd and Ian McDiarmid. The fourth film released in the Star Wars franchise, it is, however, the first of three prequels that lead up to Star Wars that was released in 1977. Plot basically follows Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn (Neeson) and his apprentice padawan Obi-Wan Kenobi (McGregor), who escort and protect Queen Amidala (Portman) from Naboo to Coruscant in the hope of finding peace as an interplanetary trade dispute starts to boil over. During the journey the party stops over at Tatooine and encounter a young boy named Anakin Skywalker. The Jedi feel the force is strong with young Skywalker and enlist him into the group with the intention of training him to become a Jedi Knight. Meanwhile, as hostilities escalate in the galaxy, the mysterious Sith is moving into the equation.The most anticipated movie of all time arrived in 1999, hyped into the stratosphere, the fanfare and bunting stretched from Hollywood to the far corners of the cinema loving world. Perhaps unsurprisingly? The Phantom Menace failed to meet the expectation of Star Wars fans and critics alike. That the film in box office receipts alone made almost $930 million, has, tended to be forgotten. But that's not to say the film deserved such rich financial rewards, because all told it didn't. It's not a great film by any stretch of the imagination, but it is a fun movie experience, and in retrospect it can be said that Lucas and co learnt from the film to make the next two film's in the series better. Mistakes were made, for sure, but for action and intrigue the film scores points well enough.On a personal note, I was one of the fans who came out of the cinema after watching it the first time and hated it. So whilst I wasn't one of the ""fans"" who at the time accused Lucas of ruining childhood memories, I was suitably annoyed to stay away from the film for over ten years. After the prequel trilogy had run its course, I was often asked by some film loving friends to give ""Menace"" another go. Their argument was that free of hype and expectation, ""Menace"" can really be enjoyed as a sort of popcorn and beer sci-fi blockbuster. And they were right. Watching it sparkle in HD and disassociating it with those golden memories of 77, 80 and 83, it has much to enjoy. Sure the old problems still exist, dodgy acting (why is McGregor playing it so fey?), Binks (aargh), fart gags (really Mr. Lucas? Really?), close to the knuckle racial stereotyping and the absence of a Hans Solo type to stir the blood of both sexes. While of course the writing is borderline tepid, full of a need to explain things and prove itself as a reason to exist. So yes, full of flaws (many others exist for different people of course), but the whizz bangery of the action and set pieces keep it, to my mind, far away from stinker status.The pod race, a souped up extension to Return of the Jedi's speed-biker pursuits, is one of the series' highlights, as is the showdown between Qui-Gon, Obi-Wan and Darth Maul (Ray Park), a superbly cool villain with an even cooler double ended light sabre. The latter of which is excellently scored by John Williams and features top notch choreography. The battles widen the eyes and the ears, notably the Droid army versus the Gungan's, and there's a whole host of new creatures and aliens to get acquainted with (check out those underwater beasties). The charge of CGI overkill is a fair one, and this issue is a more prominent problem in standard HD, never mind the Blu-ray, as the non human characters look too obviously CGI next to the human's. Which is just another reason to pick apart what's wrong with the Phantom Menace. But why do that? Sit back, relax, munch some snacks and sip that beer, it's not that bad a movie experience. Honestly. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
The First Chapter of an Epic Saga!,"The Phantom Menace far surpassed my expectations, probably because my expectations had been lowered by much of the negative criticism this film generated, mostly by disgruntled geeks who are afraid of change, like hardened conservatives panicking when a democrat wins an election. It's really childish and pathetic.The ""magic"" of Star Wars is still present in Episode 1. Although this first film seems slightly bent toward a more younger audience, this in no way affects the quality of the film. The acting, plot, visuals, audio are all top notch. The main complaints for this film seem to center around Jar Jar Binks, a character I happened to really like. The underwater trip to the Gungan city and then to the capitol of Naboo was one of the best parts of the film, and I thought the interaction between Jar Jar, Qui Gon, and Obi Wan was splendid entertainment at its finest! Sure there are a few clichés throughout this film that serve as minor annoyances but they don't in any way inhibit that ""magic"" from shining through.Episode 1 is a fine edition to the Star Wars saga, and one that did not deserve the rampant criticism it received by many. This is top notch entertainment, and George Lucas' complete Star Wars saga is a stupendous success, an impressive result of a vision and the drive to fulfill that vision.

It's fun, fast-paced (for the most part) and has frickin' Darth Maul in it!!! The story at time drags a bit and some of the dialogue isn't all that great, but there are definitely still many moments that unleash that inner kid in you, i.e. the Podracers, the epic battles at the end and that amazing lightsaber duel! I do like this entry in the saga, and every time I watch it, I go back to a somewhat simpler time; when the stresses of everyday life hadn't yet sunk in. Overall, I enjoy Ep. I and all the memories it sets off. The Force will be with you...always.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
This scapegoat of a movie definitely needs more appreciation.,"I loved this movie as a kid. I still love it at age 21. Sure, it can be a bit sloppy at times, and it switches from plot a to plot b constantly.The stereotypes can be jarring at times. But you know what, it is still brilliant. The characters are likable. Even jar jar is not that bad. The acting is OK. Not great, but OK. The hate seems to stem from old trilogy fans, not knowing that this film was merely trying to be something different. Yes, if you want a film that feels like the old trilogy, this is not for you. But if you are looking for a fast-paced, lighthearted sci-fi action movie with one or two smart scenes, good scenery, and interesting alien designs, then this is for you.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Underrated,I dont know why there's a lot of hate for this movie. The lighsaber fight are the best in the prequel and the story is pretty decent. People only complaint about the cgi i guess.,10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
For your kids only...,"OK, I really liked episodes 4 - 6, inspite of the fact that they are  quite corny and have a lot of plot holes. This movie, although it  doesn't differ TOO much from the previous three in terms of story  (which is still full of holes) and it falls short of the other Star  Wars movies in every other aspect.  The casting is reasonable, I suppose, but the script really doesn't  allow for much character interaction. Dialogues in this movie are silly  or just downright inappropriate. For example, when the monster that  chases the submarine carrying our heroes gets eaten by another monster,  all Liam Neeson can say is ""there's always a bigger fish"". What  nonsense !  Also, the first three movies didn't take themselves too seriously. To  continue this tradition, George Lucas probably decided to include  Jar-Jar Binks, who is without a doubt the most annoying character ever  to appear in any movie. The result of this dubious choice is a movie  filled with jokes that are probably funny to five year old kids.   Most of the movie's action sequences also lack any kind of tension,  probably because the main characters are put to series after series of  highly dangerous events without one of them even getting scratched. The  only memorable series are the pod-race and the last fight between Darth  Maul and the Jedis.   The special effects in this movie are great, but everything else seems  to have been dumbed down in order to make the movie more accessible to  kids, thus ensuring the sale of more action figures and other rubbish.  It's not a total loss because there's still a bit of that ""Star Wars  Magic"" in this movie, but overall ""the Phantom Menace"" is more of a  two-hours commercial then a real movie  *1/2 out of ****",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
When does the hurting stop?,"This movie is a perfect example of when what could have been one of the most brilliant movies ever is made, through the incompetence of only one man, into one of the worst.  I cannot list in detail the number of ways this movie could have been made better, and they are all mind-bogglingly simple and all George Lucas's fault.  Even so, I will try to condense them into a short list.1. Actors/Casting - I have to give all of the actors credit for this because I know they tried their best, even Jake Lloyd.  The movie did not give me a single reason why I should have cared for any of the characters and I can't explain why I did anyway.I can't count how many times people have told me how much better Haley Joel Osment would have been in the role, and I am almost inclined to agree with them.  Supposedly there's something dark and ominous about the Anakin character that all of the Jedi council can see, after all, he's gonna be Darth Vader, right?  Osment projects that fear which leads to anger which leads to etc., and Lloyd just looks like your run-of-the-mill blond California Cabbage Patch kid.  I'd call Jake Lloyd a terrible actor if it weren't for what the great sci-fi writer Orson Scott Card, who personally knows Lloyd, observed: ""Jake Lloyd's a good actor, and it's a pity you didn't get to see that on-screen, since he had no direction or screenplay. In the same way, Liam Neeson is a great actor, but you didn't see that onscreen because he had no direction or screenplay.""Which brings me to my second fault:2. Direction - Let's face it, George Lucas has lost it.  He has gone from the great actors' director he was when he made American Graffiti to a special effects artist gone wildly out of control.  I do give him some credit: It takes a lot of deliberate effort to sap all of the energy and life out of Ewan McGregor.3. Screenplay/Plot - This is the section that really makes me wince, and proves that there is nobody left in Hollywood with the courage to tell George Lucas that he can't write.  I mean, logical inconsistencies aside, this dialogue is simply ridiculous.  If a first-grader were called in as a script consultant, he could most likely have improved this movie.There are a thousand instances of questionable logic in this movie like, why did Queen Amidala reveal herself when she did?  Why did she want to go back to Naboo so badly if it would do no good whatsoever and she would probably just get killed?  Are we supposed to believe that a ten year old is going to have twins with her eventually?  Why is she called a Queen anyway, if Naboo is supposed to be a democracy?  Do the natives of Naboo share one collective brain cell to elect a teenager to run their planet?  And what kind of name is Naboo anyway?Beyond that, it doesn't even make sense in terms of the rest of the established Star Wars universe.  For example, the shields that repelled blaster fire, obviously added so the death count would be lower and they could appeal to the 'family' market.  Why do we not see them in the later episodes, when they seem to be of immeasurable tactical value?As for the so-called 'Phantom Menace' conspiracy, does the initiation into the Jedi knighthood include an IQ curtailment?  Why didn't those clods figure out at once that Palpatine was behind it all along?  In the end, I found myself rooting for Palpatine/Sidious, simply because he was geometrically more intelligent than any of the other characters and would probably do a pretty good job of ruling the universe.  At least he would be a better emperor than George Lucas is a screenwriter.Well, it seems that I didn't do a very good job at condensing, but oh well.I am ashamed to say that I saw this movie three times and hated it more each time.  That it has grossed over $400 million makes me wonder that the entire American society doesn't grind to a halt as soon as someone sees a bright shiny object.  Did I mention that the special effects were too amazing for their own good?",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
`A little less conversation a little more action'  a low point in the series,"The galaxy is run by the Republic, however they are under treat of a Rebellion run by the Trade Federation.  Sinister forces are also at work within both the Republic and the Federation and the Empire has it's hands in both in the form of Darth Sidious and his protégé Darth Maul.  Meanwhile Jedi Knights Qui-Gon Jinn and his pupil Obi Wan travel to protect the planet of Queen Amidala, along the way they find a child strong in the force and resolve to train up the child Anakin Skywalker in the ways of the Jedi.The first Star Wars movie (albeit number 4 in the production order) was always going to have a lot to live up to  after all we've been waiting for over 15 years!  Maybe that's why it was so poorly received.  The story isn't the most exciting thing due to the fact that it's setting up the coming films  the Empire is years away and is mostly in the background.  There's a lot of politics involved that make little sense and don't appear to go anywhere and this slows the film down.The film's focus is dull because the child Anakin is pretty innocent and cute  he is yet to have any hint of his future.  The action is quite cartoony and the ground battle at the end is as much reliant on slapstick comedy as it is on action.  In fairness to the film  it is less of an entity in itself and more of the stepping stone to the other films, it was never going to be the best of the lot  the best SHOULD be parts 3,4 and 5 as they are where the main action occurs (although we don't know what was planned for 7-9).  However that doesn't mean it shouldn't be good but it's bad in a number of ways.First of it totally lacks any sense of wonder or fun.  The effects may be better but the fun is gone, the characters are wooden and dry, the politics is dry etc.  Even when chased by a giant fish the Jedi remain unshakable  compare that to the action of Han Solo etc involved in a chase!  The characters are undeveloped and those that are created to be `fun' are actually annoying  namely Jar Jar Binks.  This `thing' is supposedly for children but he's just not funny.  If anything I find his `messa sorry' dialogue to be almost racist!  Could he have been made to sound more like a cotton-picking slave?  His slapstick antics aren't funny, they may amuse very young kids but compare him to the comedy of C3PO and R2D2  they were value for kids and adults alike and they weren't annoying!  To me the main concern is that it's just not fun  this only exists in a few good action scenes or a few comedy moments  but I wasn't enjoying it, I was only watching it.All the actors may be quality but they all treat the material with such respect that you'd think they were doing Shakespeare.  In part 2 they are still a bit dry but at least they get to have character and be a bit more life-like.  The only character that stood out was Darth Maul  even without any significant dialogue, at least he had passion and energyshame really!Overall this is just a stepping-stone to allow you to move on in the series. As a film it isn't enjoyable apart from a few scenes including the double-ended light sabre and the pod-race.  Happily Lucas put much of the faults right for part 2 but really as a film Part 1 is a disappointment.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Disappointing,"Although it looks amazing I found The Phantom Menace to be hugely disappointing, the story was poor and it just didn't feel like a Star Wars film. The best part by far was an amazing battle between Obi Wan Kenobi and Darth Maul. The worst by far was Jar Jar Binks, an awful, annoying, totally unfunny character. Ewen MacGregor was good as Obi Wan Kenobi but wasn't given much to do, Liam Neeson was very good also as was the child actor who played Anakin Skywalker. Natalie Portman wasn't so great though, showing little of the promise she showed in Leon. It was great to see R2D2 and C3PO again though and as you would expect the special effects were amazing including an astounding pod race sequence. Yoda was back too alongside Samuel L Jackson playing the part of a Jedi. I pray Episode II is better than this ***7/10*",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
realistically...,"I've read through quite a few of the reviews and the opinions seem to generally lean on the favorable side...but the impression that I get is that most of these favorable reviews are from fairly die-hard SW fans. First off, I have to admit that I am a SW fan but I will try to present an unbiased opinion. I saw the first movie when I was nine so, basically, I grew up with Star Wars. I had to approach this movie with an open mind as I knew getting caught up in the hype would only result in a movie that could not possibly live up to the expectations that I would have had.The biggest feature of this movie is the special effects. There is no doubt that George Lucas is known first and foremost as a special effects wizard and he does not disappoint in this movie. In fact, some of the effects were so well done that I did not even notice them right away. GL's creation of a whole other world/universe was an incredible success and definitely created the illusion of reality.The biggest drawback was Lucas's decision to have the alien creatures speak in english. A far greater effect would have been made if these creatures spoke in their native tongues with the movie subtitled. This was done in the first set of movies and definitely created the effect of realism. By having the alien creatures speak in english, it tended to take away from the SW feel. In some cases, some of the creatures accents sounded a little bit ethnic or to the opposite extreme, a bit too 'American' (one of the announcers in the pod race scene).This movie catered to both the young and the old and in Lucas's situation, it is a difficult decision to make as leaning too much in either direction would alienate audience groups. The inclusion of Jar Jar created a comic relief that was slightly different from the Ewoks but nonetheless effective. I think that if he had chosen a slightly more grown up voice and personality (while maintaining Jar Jar's innocence) not that many viewers would have found him as annoying. In fact, it probably would have allowed the audience to understand Jar Jar's race and his personal plight. The voice suggestion could have been applied to many of the creatures that GL created. It's amazing what a voice can do to the believability of a character.Neeson did an admirable job of Qui-Gon but it could have been better. He did make his character a believable Jedi Master though. McGregor did about as well as he could considering he was basically a secondary character with very few and short lines. I am sure this will change in the next two movies as it will definately revolve around his character and character development will be essential. Portman was a little stoic as the queen and as a result it was hard for the audience to feel any sympathy for her role as a ruler of a world under attack. On the flip side, her portrayal of the queen's aid (I know, I know, she was actually the queen when she went with Qui-Gon to Anakin's village) was performed a lot better as she was allowed to play a character with a little more feeling. Quite surprisingly, the character that I found the most believable was Watoo, the junk yard dealer. Maul's involvment was effective but it would have added more to the film if he had a bigger role. He was probably one of the few characters that everyone wanted to know and see more of.Overall, the movie was entertaining but it did lack a bit of the Star Wars feel to it. Rest assured the next movie will be even more entertaining. Too bad we have to wait 3 years for it. 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Pretty good prequel, doesn't live up to expectations.","Well, the critics have been up and down this film already, and I don't imagine that I am going to add anything huge to the debate, but I feel that I have to add my two cents in anyways.As said in the summary, this film didn't live up to my expectations.  I never thought it would, to be honest.  Episodes IV, V, and VI were so far ahead of their time when they were released that they made movie history. It's very difficult to top something like that.  While this film is packed with computer animation and has some very excellent action scenes (the pod race scene is excellent), I believe that the animation put the film over the edge.  Put simply, there was just too much of it.  I'm sure that every director and studio just loves computer animation, and this film had pretty good effects!  But when compared to the earlier films, taking into consideration the fact that those films used a lot of models for their shots, the animation here is just saturating.Having said that, this movie gives us the beginning of the history behind Episodes IV, V, and VI.  The storyline here is actually pretty good, and follows well with the type of plot that should be expected of any Star Wars film.  This movie certainly remains true to its ""roots"" , so to speak, and that was nice to see.  I'm also glad that Lucas didn't stray from the art of telling a good story by showing us events happening in other areas.  He also kept the usual Star Wars ""scene change"" of having the current scene replaced by one in a different place by having the new scene move in across the old one.  While some believe that is a 'cheesy' effect, it still remains familiar, and I'm glad it's kept here.Liam Neeson (Qui-Gon Jinn) and Ewan McGregor (Obi-Wan) are good in their roles, and Jake Lloyd is excellent as a young Anakin Skywalker.  However, I think that Natalie Portman (Queen Amidala) steals the show here.  Her acting is above that of Carrie Fisher as the female 'lead' in the earlier Star Wars series, and it will be interesting to see how they develop her character in the rest of the prequels.This film is mandatory for any Star Wars fan, but I'm sure it will have a lower appeal to the average person, which is the reason why Episodes IV, V, and VI were released earlier in the first place.  However, ""The Phantom Menace"" carries on the tradition of one of the best science-fiction franchises in the history of film.My Rating:  9.5/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Actually decent,"I still remember the first time I tried to watch this movie. I was 13 when I watched the original trilogy for the first time and I loved it. I wasn't really interested in seeing the prequels as I heard they are not good, but then I caught this one on TV few months after watching the originals and I barely made it through the first half and then I stopped. I absolutely hated it and even called it the worst movie ever for some time. Then there was the entire hype for The Force Awakens and I decided to watch them all before seeing The Force Awakens, doesn't matter if I don't like some of them, I'll watch them all. So, after watching the original trilogy, it was the time for this one. I was kinda bored at the beginning, but later realized that it's actually not bad at all. The effects look a little dated, but a lot of them were practical, so I'll forgive them. The acting is nothing special, just good enough to not be bad and Ewan McGregor probably gave the best performance and he's one of the very few who stand out. But what really made me like this movie is the villain, Darth Maul. He's one of the coolest villains ever and is my favorite Star Wars character so far. Too bad he's so underused and I really hope they make a spin-off (in my opinion, he's a much more interesting character than Boba Fett) about him or bring him back in the new trilogy. Ray Park also nailed the role even with only few lines (from what I heard, it wasn't even his voice), but he's really intimidating and I could talk about his character all day but I'll stop now to say more about the movie. And the award for the worst comic relief ever goes to Jar Jar Binks! He's one of the biggest reasons people hate this movie and you'll see why. And while everyone is talking about him, everyone forgets about Sebulba. Gosh, that underrated a-hole! He's the most annoying character in every movie ever! These two were also a big reason why I used to hate this movie. Looking on the directing, Lucas didn't do the greatest job ever, and considering he was also a writer of this movie, and looking back at A New Hope, we all know he can do much better then this. But still, it turned out okay, could've been better, but it's not the worst in the series. The worst in my opinion comes after this, with Attack of the Clones. But I'm not gonna say much about it here, I'll leave that for it's own review.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Re-evaluated after 12 years,"I saw this movie in the theater, not on opening night, but shortly after. I was friends with folks who knew the original series by heart, played Star Wars games, and read Star Wars books. They were horribly disappointed with this movie, and I took all that negativity to heart.I just rewatched it for the first time since the theater (perhaps there was one other viewing in there). I watched it with someone who didn't know anything about Star Wars; and I expected us to hate it. Actually, we loved it.It's not a flawless movie. Some things were definitely missteps: racial stereotypes, midi-chlorians, some flat acting. But overall, the movie was incredibly fun and intriguing. Nothing I hated before was nearly as bad as I had thought, including Jar Jar; in fact some things were enjoyable that I disliked before.The original trilogy was no polished work. It had a lot of bad acting (e.g. Luke) and more than it's share of kiddy jokes (e.g. Yoda when we first see him, Ewoks). But it also was incredibly linear. The plots of all three original movies were fairly simple, straight-forward adventures. The only curve-ball was Darth Vader being Luke's father. In contrast, the new trilogy has a much more in depth and intriguing plot. Figuring out who is what and exactly what is happening turned out to be half the fun - and once it was figured out (it actually does make sense if you focus on Palpatine), it's much more ingenious.I kinda think of it like this: if you like great characters, a romping adventure story, and a happy ending, the original trilogy is better; if you like political intrigue, mystery, and tragedy, the new trilogy is better.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
A GREAT MOVIE !!!!!!,"I just want to say that Star Wars Episode 1 was great. At first i didn't want to see it but my family made me and i really liked it i went and saw it twice. I thought that the graphics were great the music was SUPERB i love the ""DUEL OF THE FATES"" To anyone who are getting let down by other peoples comments and disappointed it is up to you what you think. The characters are also great like Ewan Mc-Gregor as Obi-wan Kenobi and Liam Neeson as Quigon Jinn and i just want to say one more thing and that is that i think Jar-Jar Binks was a funney character every movie need's a funney character like in the originals R2-D2 + C3-P0 + Chewbacc were all the funney one's there.Plus i can't wait to the next two movies.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
A Good Film that Fails to Meet Expectations,"The title to this review may be the understatement of the century, but it's truer than what many other reviewers will tell you. When I first reviewed this film, I gave it a 9 out of 10. I recognized the film had some flaws, but I loved it so much that I overlooked them and focused on what I loved about the movie and Star Wars in general. But, watching the movie now, as an adult, it's clear that it hasn't held up that well. My mind is not as clouded by my love of all things Star Wars, and I think I'm able to give it a more level headed review.I grew up in the 80s, and like many boys my age, I lived and breathed Star Wars. For me and many like me, this was the most anticipated movie of my life. I was only 3 when Return of Jedi came out, and didn't get the opportunity to see it in theaters, so for me, this movie was a very big deal in 1999. And it was very exciting. I loved it, it was probably the only time I clapped or cheered in a movie theater. It was a great experience. I actually saw the film a few times afterwords, but unlike the older Star Wars movies, I started to like it less and less each time I saw it. I still loved it, but it didn't have the same greatness the older ones had.Part of the problem was the messy plot. It's difficult to tell what exactly is at stake for our protagonists in this movie, because you're not sure what the bad guys' plans are, and exactly what or why they're doing what they're doing. There are many plodding moments in this movie in which the plot seems to lose focus. It seems to go off on tangents that, at times, get rather dull. The dialog and acting is weak at times and the weaker moments stick out more upon repeated viewings.Also, the characterization is a little weak. There's no clear protagonist that the viewer can relate to. You have the Jedi, Obi Wan and Qui Gon, who seem to know a lot more than the audience and so make poor protagonists. Then there's Queen Amidala and her handmaiden, whose identities are often confusing and it's not clear what the audience is supposed to know about their relationship to each other. There's also Jar Jar Binks the alien quirky comic relief. As ridiculous as he is, he's probably the easiest to relate to because he's the most clueless one of them all. A lot of people hated Jar Jar because of his quirky way of speaking and cartoony design. Personally, I didn't mind him and found him quite funny at times. But I can see why people were annoyed by him, since he, the quirky comic relief, was the only one the audience could relate to early on and he therefore seemed to get a lot of screen time.Finally there's Anakin, who is the closest thing to a main protagonist we get. But he's not introduced until 45 minutes into the movie. Perhaps this is not such a bad thing as his acting is quite weak, but he's a 9 year old kid so he gets a little leeway. This is probably the most kid friendly of the Star Wars movies. Although there is some mild violence, it is definitely less intense than some of the other movies. Plus the young character of Anakin is someone that a child can relate to. Jar Jar is also quite popular with kids, as his slapstick brand of humor is something that I found got them laughing pretty hard in the theater. But just because it is kid friendly doesn't mean that there isn't something for adults to enjoy as well.There are enough great moments in this movie to make it worth watching at least once. The visuals and action are spectacular and the John Williams Score is fantastic as always. There are some really strong emotional moments too, especially with Anakin's mother, and between Obi Wan and Qui Gon towards the end. Many believe that this film is a waste because there's no point in seeing Anakin as a kid. While I can see their point, I have to disagree. Seeing Anakin as an innocent kind hearted boy makes his overall character arc later in the saga all the more tragic. In this aspect this film accomplishes what it needs to accomplish. It sets the stage for the Star Wars Saga and introduces Anakin, the Saga's main character, as he was before he became a Jedi and before he lost his innocence.Though probably the weakest film in the saga, it's still a very good one to see. But it doesn't hold up too well on repeated viewings. If I were to introduce Star Wars to someone I probably would not start with this film, unless they were a child. Start them with the original 1977 film, Episode IV: A New Hope. This is the classic that started it all, and it still holds up as a great film. The characters are much stronger and the protagonists are easier for older audiences to relate to. This makes it the best way to be introduced to the world of Star Wars.If they like the original Star Wars movie (and who wouldn't), show them Episode V, 1980's Empire Strikes Back, arguably the best of the films. After that, show them this film. After seeing Empire they will have a deeper understanding of the world of Star Wars going in and will appreciate the back-story more. Plus, it's only natural that, due to the loose ends left open at the end, someone who has just seen Empire Strikes Back will have a million questions about the back-story and will want to see the prequels at that point.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Leave Your Preconceptions Behind,"I know it's fashionable to scorn the ""prequel"" trilogy, but if one stands back a bit, things tend to snap into perspective. Compare ""Phantom Menace"" to most any other fantasy/sci-fi film, and it has to rate very high indeed.Plot: this is the more ""adult"" side of the Star Wars galaxy. The politics are remarkably credible, with the entire plot hinging on the result of a vote of no-confidence! How many adults even know what that is? (Hmm... maybe this explains the low ratings.) The relationships between the races on Naboo, the role of the Jedi... these things are established more clearly, and depicted more credibly than in any of the other five films.Technical achievement: Lucas paints on a vast digital canvas, and creates a world of wonders that have simply never been imagined by lesser talents. This is a living, breathing, believable world, that makes the world of the original trilogy seem cartoonish and contrived by comparison. Naboo, from the city, to the underwater kingdom, to the rolling green hills, is one of the great fantasy worlds, up there with those of the Thief of Baghdad (both versions), Blade Runner, or 2001. And our first glimpse of Coruscant has got to be one of the most memorable ""wow"" moments in the history of the movies.Characters: Liam Neeson's Qui Gon is one of the strongest characters in the Star Wars films, and Ewan McGregor's Obi Wan a worthy, more-dashing successor to the older version created by Alec Guinness. And Jar Jar Binks? Annoying? Not compared to the insipid C-3PO, or the insufferably perky R2-D2. Jar Jar is a fully formed character, with surprising depths. His manner is odd, perhaps abrasive, but he offers far more than the single note that Lucas used for his original comic-relief characters. And, of course, the fact that he is one of the first fully digital characters in film history has to be worth something. But Ian McDiarmid's Senator Palpatine is perhaps the most under-appreciated of all. This is an Oscar-worthy supporting performance, a character who is both frighteningly real and perfectly ambiguous. McDiarmid balances his performance on a knife's edge, managing to be both fatherly and deeply unsettling.Yes, it may be that a certain human dimension is weaker here than in the original Star Wars. We don't have a clear ""hero"". There's no Luke, no Han. That's a valid point, but it is not inevitably a criticism. Qui Gon and Obi Wan aren't the comic-book heroes of A New Hope, but they are likable, heroic, and rich in characterization. If I had a choice between seeing 10 more episodes of the life of Han Solo or of Qui Gon Jinn, I'd choose the latter without hesitation.Story: The storyline in this film seems more real, more substantial than in the other five. We have the perfect sense of scale, from human drama to global (or interstellar) conflict. The one quibble might be the pod race. It's certainly entertaining, but does it go on too long? I think perhaps so. This is a structural weakness, but not a huge one. (Does Luke spend WAY too long on Dagobah, listening to warmed over Zen platitudes from that rubbery little jerk Yoda? Yes! Yet this is in the film most viewers seem to, unaccountably, pick as the ""best"" of the six. Clearly, there's some latitude for narrative digressions...)And then there's the climactic sword fight. I'd rate the three-way duel in Phantom Menace as the second-best sword fight in the Star Wars series, close after the finale of Return of the Jedi. The latter has a wonderful mythic quality, but this one is more visceral, more scary... partly because Darth Maul is such a cold, merciless villain, and partly because you know from the outset that the outcome is genuinely in doubt, that one of the Good Guys really could die. And the staging, using three master swordsmen, each with very different technique... This is just about as good as action film gets. Only two or three other movie duels come close: Rob Roy, again with Neeson, oddly enough; Scaramouche; Robin Hood... I can't think of a fourth. The closing duel ALONE should raise Phantom Menace into the front ranks of action and fantasy films.Bottom line: there is so much to enjoy in this film, so much to see, so much to feel, that it is amazing how anyone can possibly rate it below a 7 or 8. This is a scale of film making that few have ever attempted, let alone pulled off so beautifully. Perhaps that's the film's biggest fault: Lucas makes it all seem too easy.But, of course, we all know the REAL reason people can't give this film the 10 it richly deserves. That reason lies within themselves. Viewers in 1999 (let alone 2007) just couldn't feel as young, as innocent, as optimistic as they did when they saw the very first Star Wars. (Especially if they saw it way back in 1977, 30 years ago). Star Wars hasn't changed, George Lucas hasn't changed, nearly so much as the audience has changed. Alas. Moviegoers who are truly so jaded that they can't feel the passion and revel in the breadth of vision of The Phantom Menace have my sincerest sympathy. Yes, you can be ever so-o cool by putting down the prequel trilogy, but missing one of the best movies of all time is a very high price to pay.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
If the fourth Star Wars movie had been the first there never would have been a second,"Let's face the awful truth. You don't even need to watch the film to see what is going on. You can just listen to - or for that matter just read the lyrics of - Weird Al Yankovic's ""The Saga Begins"" and you have seen the movie. Besides impressive special effects and good acting from a stellar cast there is nothing to see here people, move along.I say good acting because it is not the cast's fault they were given mundane dialogue and thus portrayed characters I just did not care about. The only interesting idea brought up here not brought up in the original trilogy is that fear in sufficient amounts is necessary for survival, but in excess it can destroy a person. And that it is possible for a nine year old boy to hit on a fourteen year old girl and have a shot AFTER puberty. That's it, that's all. It's not a menace, but this film is definitely a phantom of the first two Star Wars films and maybe even of the third, which was also a step down in quality in my humble opinion.",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Take it for what it is,"This movie, the most hyped movie of all time, has been put under the microscope and looked at in a variety of different ways. It seems that everyone had prejudged the movie before it was even released, and then strutted about claiming that they told you that it would be that way. There was the die-hards, who were impossible to dissapoint. There were of course the disenchanted and the unimpressible, who probably would not had conceeded the movie was good no matter what. There were the people who acted as if this movie symbolized their disapproval of media hype itself, and by principle decided to dislike the film. Looking over the other comments I see the opposing viewpoints clearly. OK, the movie was overhyped, but what do you expect in 1999, the year of hype? I was four years old when the A New Hope came out, and of course, I loved it. I was four, and a science fiction epic can have its way with a boy of that age. I think many people in the 20-35 age group expected to have that same life changing event that happened to them twenty years ago this time around. That is the equivalent of going to Disney World for the first time since you were a kid and being let down: Did you expect the impact to be the same? Take the movie for what it is. OK, it isn't just any movie, but it behaved like one, with strong points and weak ones as well. First the strong points.1. All the acting was terrific, with the exception of Jake Lloyd. Many critics complained of the stiffness of the Jedi characters. What some people saw as flat acting I believe was well acted restraint by Neeson and Mcgregor. Their characters were kung-fu monks, not the pirate Han Solo and the upstart Luke. 2. All of the sets and costumes were beautiful. Even Oscar worthy. 3. The music was terrific. John Williams outdid himself with the otherworldly choir at the end. Breathtaking! 4. The fight scenes were excellent as well, better than the ones in the Matrix because they had less special effects woven in. 5. The plot had more substance than the prior three combined. The intricate dealings of politics, the metaphysical properties of the force, the nature of bondage and the messianic innuendos sent me reeling. 6. The pod race. Ben Hur for the Space Age.And for the weak points: 1. The flow changed speeds too often, making it seem somewhat unnatural. 2. Something did not work for me with Anakin's success at the end. It seemed more haphazard than the supernatural workings of the force. 3. Jake Lloyd is not a good actor. Period. the scenes between him and Portman awkward and seemed difficult. 4. The fact that some of the races of aliens resembled ethnic groups should not be considered offensive (I wasn't offended, and could have been). It does, however, seem like a lack of imagination.Personally, I put this movie ahead of ROTJ, but behind the first two. It still definitely is worth watching. By the way, I was rather indifferent to Jar-Jar, as I was to the plight of R2-D2 and C3PO in all the other movies. I have a feeling history will smile on this movie as the story progresses in the future installments and we become more familiar with some of the new concepts introduced in this one. If you have decided not to go to any of them anymore, fine. That means just less of a line for me.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Unnecessary hatred,"Just as older generations grew up with the original Star Wars movies, I grew up with the prequel series.
Star Wars is not known for its twisted plot and complexity, nor the complex characters development and logical events, but for the epic atmosphere and charming and memorable characters; this characteristic applies to all 6 movies.
I really don't get the hate for Jar Jar Binks; I actually liked this silly concept; silliness is being present in all the Star Wars movies anyway.
For me, the new Star Wars prequel series are just as good as the older ones; I also take them on a personal level 'cause I really enjoyed them when I was... smaller.
What annoys me the most is that people say this is as bad as other modern Hollywood movies that are really crappy: ""Narnia"", ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" etc; please stop or I'll catch the CopperCab frenzy and insult you all!!! TOO LATE! Attention haters!! I'll make videos on YouTube dedicated to all Star Wars prequels haters! And I mean business because I'm not even a ginger!
Seriously, stop complaining, just enjoy it without thinking too much!",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Great visuals and a promising cast marred by a nonsensical plot and even more nonsensical characters.,"I'll always remember The Phantom Menace for the podracing. I played the Nintendo game for more hours than I can count, so for nostalgia alone I can't outright dislike this movie. It's great looking for sure. The lush environments and set designs are excellent, as is the appearance of Darth Maul - possibly the most underused character in the entire franchise. But the actual meat of the movie - the plot, the characters, the flow - is an absolute mess. It's like a McDonald's meal. It gives you temporary satisfaction and looks appealing at first, but there's no substance and ultimately leaves you feeling guilty and disappointed.First of all, the movie has no right to be so damn long. Half the dialogue is platitudes and political jargon, the other half is Jar Jar. And I can't even blame Jar Jar for his idiocy, because it's Qui-Gon who thinks it's a good idea to bring this stupid creature along for the ride. Like, why on earth would a wise Jedi Knight like Qui-Gon trust in a random Gungan to do... what did he want from Jar Jar again? It was a total coincidence that there was a Gungan army, and Jar Jar was a total nuisance during their mission on Naboo, so why the hell did Qui-Gon keep him around? It makes no sense. And I can go on and on about what doesn't make sense about this movie. For the sake of time, I'll just name the second biggest offender and that's young Anakin. Aside from the fact that the last thing we needed was to see Darth Vader as a bratty child, Anakin is one of the most annoying characters in the franchise. Everything he does works out perfectly. How do the Jedi succeed? Because Anakin saves the planet from the droid army! How? He accidentally flew into space and destroyed the federation ship, also by accident! Yay, for one of the most ridiculous and frustrating deus ex machinas in movie history.Every other character is a cardboard cutout. Qui-Gon has no personality, neither does Yoda, or Mace Windu, or Padmé. The only likable character is Obi-Wan and even he gets whiny at times. The plot is just horrendous. I mean, who wants to learn about politics and intergalactic taxation laws in the Star Wars universe? I sure as hell don't.What saves this movie is the lightsaber duel at the end. Seriously, if not for the battle with Darth Maul this movie would be borderline unwatchable. Duel of the Fates is one of the best John Williams pieces ever, and the fight itself is epic. Sure, they look like they're dancing, but who cares? The choreography is awesome and it just looks amazing. It's how you'd expect a fight with a Sith Lord to go down. It also has suspense, which was completely absent from the movie before then. The only issue with it is that it cuts from the saber fight to the Gungan battle with Jar Jar (who was promoted to general for some dumbass reason) acting like an idiot and only managing to stay alive by accident, and Anakin flying around in space also only staying alive by accident. But the saber fight is so great I'll let it slide. That still doesn't account for the first hour and a half of the movie.The Phantom Menace is a bloated mess with a couple promising aspects and one incredible fight to keep you entertained. The thing is, it's a fun movie, but only if you shut off your brain and throw logic out the window.",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Shutup and enjoy the movie.,"I, too, am irritated by countless critics and ""Star Wars Fans"" that have picked this movie apart, sighting racial undertones, bad story, and bad acting, to name a few. There is a real world parallel here......Anything, I think of a politician in particular, under such scrutiny, is bound to have flaws in him/her, or IT, as is the case with TPM. This new Star Wars movie had almost unlimited expectations, and as a result, almost unlimited scrutiny. Sure, the movie isn't flawless, but so many people, it seems, went to see this movie for the express purpose of finding something wrong with it. George Lucas thought of, wrote, directed, and paid for this movie himself. It is HIS vision, and HIS story to tell as he sees fit. To look so hard for fault with his story is rude. How many kids, after hearing a scary story in the dark at summer camp, dissect the story, and analyze what they think might have made it better, or look for hidden meaning where there is none? Certainly none that I went to camp with. I applaud Mr. Lucas for sticking to his ideal of making movies for people that like to watch movies, I certainly enjoyed this movie, and will be among the first in line to see the next. Sadly, I'll probably be in line right behind those same people....waiting to dissect, analyze, and be the first to find something wrong with someone else's story. To those people: THESE MOVIES ARE NOT MADE FOR YOU!! STICK TO THE ACADEMY AWARDS SECTION OF YOUR LOCAL VIDEO STORE IF YOU WANT CRITIC-FRIENDLY MOVIES.

"Miraculously, It's Better Than People Say","'The Phantom Menace' is actually a good movie - with flaws. Most of my complaints stem from the fact that this movie works way better in theaters AND when I was younger.Having observed this movie many years later, there's a lot of savory things along with some bad. First, the bad.Jar Jar's character was OK, to be honest, with the exception of one scene: THE CLIMAX! Seriously, it might work for kids, but when you're building up to a grand slam end, it only weakens it to have some goofball hopping in between droids trying to play ball-tossing. Diagnosis: some misplaced comic relief. Another weak point wasn't so much the acting - but rather the wasted moments where tension could be kept better. ""Oh, we're being shot at. Shields up at maximum."" Most of the bad acting was really the boring security guards trying to talk politics most of the time. Also, and I'll probably be the only one to say this: Natalie Portman was a little too wooden to make me believe her homeworld is in danger. Lastly, and this is the biggest problem - the Sith. We know the Sith are evil. We know the sith are enemies to the jedi. BUT WHO ARE THE SITH!? The film never really explains, and even keeps Darth Maul in the shadows most of the time the movie runs. With a proper explanation, the film could've felt more like 'The Beginning' instead of 'Starting a certain point-in-time in the Star Wars Universe'.NOW! The good . . . we're introduced into a whole different world from the original trilogy, and each new scenic place IS inspired, just as well as the originals worked for their days. The visuals were astounding, though on the little screen aren't nearly as impressive. Characters are INTRODUCED in part one, and are DEVELOPED in part two. I think the characters were introduced pretty well. The only problem with this is that the characters are just . . . there. There's no swaggering Han Solo, no underestimated Luke . . . just an obedient Obi-One, a politically motivated Queen Amidala, and a Jedi Qui-gon.Overall, it IS good, and I think the reason most people were disappointed with it was because they had in mind certain little things that made it obvious Anakin turns into Darth Vader - in the movie, Anakin is an innocent little boy, not someone who will obviously become evil, for example.I recommend it.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
I can see the cinema vérité buried within this gem of a film,"A lot of miserable losers hated this when it came out and I can see why. It's one of the best fantasty sci-fi films targeted to kids I've ever seen. While I can certainly understand hating on the disney sequels for being so cold and sanitized, the amount of hate these films get is completely unwarranted. The die-hard original trilogy fans that take star wars way too seriously desperately try to convince us that George Lucas ruined Star Wars when in reality, he breathed new life into it.I loved every minute of following Qui-Gon Jinn and the rest of the ensemble around the slums of Mos Eisley. Everytime I watch A New Hope, I yearn for more of Mos Eisley, flesh this place out and the people who live there! George Lucas delivers the world building I yearn for, he truly brings out the child in me. Watching the patient Jedi face interesting challenges that require finesse, patience, detective skills; WHAT A TREAT. Not even the annoying yet whimsical JarJar can stop me from loving this movie. I went into this expecting a train wreck and ended up with amazing world building and great cinematography! The racing scene is exciting with a great build up to it. The jedi vs droid fight scene sprinkled through rich lore expanding political intrigue! All in a kids movie! Wow!Fantastic film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Honestly, I can't see the ""disappointment"" behind this.","I think the hate behind this film is fueled by the fact that people expected Star Wars to be perfect. And it wasn't. Especially considering that George Lucas was back at the helm as director. Only a few flaws keep it from being great.The first being that it is too slow. Half way through the film the characters show up on a planet named Corusant. These twenty to thirty minutes of film are probably the most boring and pretentious of the entire saga. Consisting of long court scenes that are too slow and for the most part lack emotional drive.The next being Lucas' newest creation Jar-Jar Binks, a Gungan from the planet Naboo. I understand that he supposed to appeal to the younger crowd, so I can't speak for them. But as creation for anyone above the age of 12, he's simply annoying after a while. While I can see him being manageable in small doses.The unfortunate casting of Jake Lloyd as Anakin Skywalker. I doubt that this is the best Lucas could do. As he is rarely genuine and believable and is an all around bad actor. Much of his most embarrassing moments, acting wise, could easily have been edited out and saved us the cringe of watching dialogue that is either corny dialogue or a corny actor reading dialogue. I'm inclined to believe the latter.Other than that and a few nitpicks, this film has nothing really incredibly wrong with it. It's solid, it's plot holds up, sets up the next film, while still being it's own film. Not to mention it's amazing and ground breaking visuals. It's a good film that doesn't deserve the hate that it receives.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
A great addition to the Star Wars legacy,"After a long delay (and much anticipation) we finally got the first part of Lucas's story, and where the trouble all began. Many other people viewed it as a rather sub-par attempt, uncreative and unsurprising. I couldn't disagree more. One could go with the impressive state-of-the-art digital effects, one could go with the great cast of new characters (the awesome Liam Neeson as Qui-Gon Jinn, for instance), the return of old favorites (Kenny Baker as R2D2 or Frank Oz as Yoda), John Williams' ever-wonderful score, the complicated story (I won't bother discussing the plot; everyone knows what it's about by now) or the awesome action sequences (the light saber duel at the end of the film is the best!). It's obvious this film was misunderstood by many, and too many movie-goers set their expectations too high, which is unfair to Mr. Lucas to say the least. I was excited for the chance to see a new Star Wars film, but I took no expectations into the theater with me -- I went in ready for nothing and walked away very satisfied. I saw this film four times in the theater, something I don't do much of these days. Lucas did a great job, and since this film is really only exposition for the overall series, how can one expect it to be a topper to the original trilogy? He's just setting everything up! Give Mr. Lucas a break. If this film had been released first, it would have been the rage of ages just as A New Hope was when it first came out. Everything in this film was very nicely done; the cast and crew all performed their jobs exceptionally. The story was far more complex and interesting than usual, with more going on and more problems to solve. By the way, everyone, the ""Phantom Menace"" referred to by the title is so obvious that very few people truly understood what it was... the Phantom Menace was the orchestrator of the evil deeds, the driving force behind the attacks, the central villain of the picture... a character we see mainly as a hologram (only once otherwise): Darth Sidious. Darth Sidious is the Phantom Menace, and the evil single man who drives the entire plot. The movie was perfectly named. I loved this movie, and it has become one of my favorite Star Wars films (alongside A New Hope). I can't wait for Episode II!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Oh Jar-Jar, How Do I Hate Thee?  Let Me Count The Ways.","I'm sure everyone has heard all their friends, relatives, and random passerbys gripe over the immense waste of computer generated imagery known as Jar-Jar Binks, but I just can't help it.  No movie character has ever driven me to the brink of tongue chomping, teeth gnashing psychosis like that floppy eared moron.  I cannot understand why this creature (which appears to be the combination of a four-year-old, Carribbean native, a mutated guppy, and that weird dragon/dog thing from Neverending Story with bigger lip implants) is even included.  All he manages to do is p*** people off while at the same time manage to avoid death every moment due to some undeserved luck.  So many times I found myself praying that one of the Jedis would just draw their saber and silence the fish-man forever. Unfortunately, the Jedi code restricts such action, proving that the dark side is much more agreeable.Jar-Jar, as horribly evil as he may be, is not the only thing to dislike about this movie.  Who knows why, but Lucas must have decided that people who go to movies only go to movies because they wish to escape a world full of text images, and thus most of the different alien races in Episode 1 speak english, limiting the use of subtitles.  Hey, that's not too bad right?  Well, wait till you hear the Trade Federation honchos that sound like over-exaggerated Japanese-Americans.  Oh, and don't forget the Gungans that remind me of, no offense, a Jamaican with a brain defect.  Since today's illiterate audiences can't muster the mind power to read basic lines to begin with, let's make the characters speak english in horribly offensive accents.  It's just more immense annoyances that make me want to microwave my brain until I drool myself to death.Speaking of annoying, how about that kid who plays Anakin Skywalker, the focus of the three prequels?  Here we have a nine-year-old child who can build things that NASA could only fantasize about, and who tackles such massive sociological issues such as world peace (except multiplied by 100 billion to equal galaxy peace).  In case you were unaware, Anakin is destined to be Darth Vader, so I understand that Lucas wanted Anakin to appear as a good-hearted soul, but boy does he lay it on thick.  Thank you George, I get it, he's sweeter than one of those gigantic lolipops you find at Disneyland, and we should all weep at this boy's impending peril.  I can't tell you how many times I wanted to slap that kid.  It is far too difficult to make a pre-teen appear to be 35.  I just see a spoiled little runt that rocket scientists would envy, yet for some reason we are supposed to care that this adorable little sandy haired genius is doomed to the dark side (which I determined earlier is much more agreeable than all that good Jedi stuff).  Think of all the trouble that would have been saved if Obi-Wan had just smote him on sight.Episode 1 is so ridiculously annoying that I couldn't even pay attention to the highly ornate special effects.  I could care less how seamless Jar-Jar looks.  Why can't he just shut up?  And Anakin, you can stop bragging any time about your wonderful science projects and immeasurable I.Q.  If only you could see into the future.  You might weep as much as I did after suffering through this sci-fi fantasy turned horrendous pile of steaming poo.  Sorry George, maybe next time.",2.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
'The Force Awakens' makes this film look really good,"I actually enjoyed this film.I like the continuation of the saga, showing how the evil empire and the Emperor came about.

Phantom is a MASTERPIECE...compared to modern SW offerings!,"I have just given this a refresh viewing & I can honsetly say the Phantom Menace is a MASTERPIECE when compared to the utter garbage that Disney has been dishing up, disguised as Star Wars over the past few years. Sure it has its obvious problems, such as the disastrous Jar Jar Binks & the casting of a cute kid who can't act who is supposed to be the future evil Darth Vader, in this film referred to as ""Annie"" ? With said young Darth Vader saying lines such as ""Yippe, opps, take this & woHooo!"" sorry, just does not work. The story is also very weak with far too much attention being paid to visuals & CGI, which actually make it pleasing to the eye. However when you consider the awesome acting talent here Liam Neeson, Ewan McGregor, Samual L. Jackson, Natalia Portman & Ian McDiarmid, its hard to believe how badly their characters come across, which leads me to the conclusion that the characters were not developed enough, a script that was sadly lacking & poor direction. However, all the actors did their very best. Anyway, after suffering the resent Disney ""efforts"" at Star Wars with the in your face social justice agenda, the Phantom Menace is almost an utter joy to watch! Just take it at face value. It is not a ""good"" SW story, but the visuals are well done & imaginative which almost make up for some of its other less redeeming qualities & the only real dissapointment for me was the compleat waste of superb acting talent. But its still entertaining.Well for anyone, like me who loved the original SW & is sick to death of Disney's corporate offerings, it is certainly worth giving this another go, even if its just for the visual entertainment value. I can guarentee you that if you compare this with the flacid, incompetent disaster of the Last Jedi, you might just appreciate the Phantom Menace a bit more.

Good sci-fi movie; so-so Star Wars movie,"I waited 17 years for this movie.  Star Wars was the first movie I ever saw in a theater (I was seven).  Needless to say, I was expecting a lot from the newest entry in the Star Wars saga and I must admit I was slightly disappointed in what I feel is the weakest of all the films.Lucas spared no expense on special effects, but the eye-popping CGI effects in this movie are so perfect that they are almost TOO perfect.  In many ways, the original Star Wars films -- with their models of space ships and on-location sets -- look more realistic than entire landscapes and battle scenes done on computers, IMHO.This is a movie for kids of today, not kids like me who grew up with Star Wars and are now twentysomethings.  There is no other explanation for the annoying presence of the computer-animated character Jar Jar Binks, who seems to serve no other purpose than to interrupt otherwise serious dialogue with barely decipherable, inane banter (he sounds like a Jamaican on crack). Sure, the Ewoks in Return of the Jedi were annoying and almost sank that epic, but at least they didn't speak English.  Jeez.  I anticipate a slew of ""I hate Jar Jar"" pages after this movie is released to the general public.Episode I is filled with non-stop action and I enjoyed seeing familiar characters like Yoda, Tuskan Raiders, Jawas, Jabba the Hutt and especially C3PO and R2-D2, because we get to see how they met for the first time. Natalie Portman is lovely as the queen and her costumes are exquisite. Liam Neeson could have benefitted from some caffeine for this role -- he looked bored as hell.  Ditto for Ewan McGregor.  In fact, many of the characters droned on and on in monotone voices -- there were no colorful personalities like Leia or Han Solo, which really hurt this film.  Even Darth Maul, the bad-ass Sith who looks so cool and has a great musical theme when he is on-screen, doesn't have enough screen time.  Actually, NO ONE is given enough screen time for us to develop any real attachment to except Jar Jar Binks, who is deposited in almost every scene for what Lucas must have felt was necessary ""comic relief.""  At least the light-saber battle with Maul, Neeson and McGregor was killer (a-hem!).I know I'm dwelling on the disappointing aspects of Episode I but don't get me wrong -- this is a compelling science-fiction film, competently made and certainly no embarrassment.  But ""Star Wars"" is so much more than that, and this one is lacking some of the magic.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

10 YEARS ON.... and actually it's quite good!,"First time I saw this when it originally came out I along with most people it seems didn't think it was very good and found it hard to understand what was going on. I assumed the fault was with the film now I'm not so sure the fault wasn't with me. I was never the biggest Star Wars fan anyway, I'd seen the original two or three times over the years and never been that impressed but since acquiring all six films on DVD I thought I'd give it a real go again and for the the first time I really enjoyed the original film and started to see what all the fuss was about. So in a short space of time I've watched all three of the original films and then I saw this and it did make a huge difference I could follow the story much better and know who the characters were and more importantly who they would become. Now I think 'The Phantom Menace is a much better film then I had thought, maybe not comparable with the first Star Wars but I found it was much much better than 'Return Of The Jedi' which I thought quite poor in many areas. There is perhaps a little too much emphasis on humour which I agree doesn't always work but on the whole the balance between action, talking and humour is pretty balanced. I think when it first came out the expectation was so high that there was no way it could live up to it, in fact I think the film is very comparable and consistent to the others in the series and in my opinion a big improvement on the last film.

probably the most expensive piece of garbage I've ever seen,"Has anybody wasted more resources a film so bad? This is on a par with Battlefield Earth.Lukas should be chained and shackled and dragged away from the delusions of grandeur that apparently convinced him he was capable of undertaking the writing and directing for this film. It's barely watchable garbage. I was a huge fan of the original series, and this film left me more than just 'cold.' It left me angry: angry at the hubris of a filmmaker squandering a legacy (an 'empire' if you will) that is the Star Wars phenomenon, and angry at the drone-like fans who will lap anything up with a brand-name on it.The long and short of my review for this film? I've played *video games* that were more convincing than this film, and they had *better acting* as well! I can't blame the actors though: there's no script to speak of here. Lukas should have just built 'droid actors' to play all the parts, he would have achieved the same result. The ""plot"" - where it exists at all - takes a backseat and is largely just a vehicle or excuse to have our beloved Jedi knights hacking away at things with their lightsabres from the first five minutes of the film onwards. There's no buildup to anything in this film. It's ALL eye candy and no substance. And Lukas should be seriously taken to task - and possibly drawn and quartered - for the insufferable Jar Jar Binks and his racially-profiled pidgin dialect. Most of the 'creatures' in this film look like they would be more at home on the set of Sesame Street than in a science-fiction ""epic"". A truly laughable, horrid film.I also think that, only a few years after its release, this film already looks horribly ""dated"" in a way that the original series does NOT and probably never will. That can easily be explained by Lukas' complete over-reliance on CGI technology which is developing in leaps and bounds every day. He basically boxed himself into obselescence with this one. The original series' production actually involved *designing and building REAL sets, and manipulating REAL cameras in creative and ground-breaking ways to capture scenes on REAL film - thus giving the original Star Wars a certain REAL quality that makes it 'believable' to the audience, even twenty-five years later. Instead of building on that legacy that so effectively married technology to traditional cinematic technique which found brilliant and creative ways to present its material, Lukas thinks that computers can solve all his directorial and cinematic 'problems'. The result is a film that has the longevity (and relevance) of an original Commodore 64 or Nintendo video game... In twenty years - in marked contrast to the original series - THIS film will be held up as an example as what happens when a filmmaker lets technology run amok and take the place of basic elements like story, plot, cinematography, and directing...",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Stay 'til the curtain closes!,"I have to admit to being a little disappointed - not because of the hype but because it was so clearly part 1 of 3 instead of being self-contained (as Star Wars IV was) and everything was so obvious.  The only real surprise for me was the origin of the Emperor.  However, I advise all fans to stay to the very end because, once the music fades out, there is a little treat for you all which makes the hairs on the back of your neck stand up.I also have a dislike of computer generated characters and would much prefer to see real people in costumes - if only so that the other characters can look them in the eye instead of over their left ear or somewhere in the region of their chin!  However, as droid control was so easy to destroy, perhaps this is the beginning of a humanoid army for the empire.Once again a serious lack of female role models (though Natalie Portman was very good) and some seriously racist issues such as the Japanese-style trade baddies and the good-for-a-laugh characters who were negro-like.  Surely we are past this sort of  stereo-typing?Thought Neeson and McGregor were dreadful (I am usually a fan) but have excepted the fact that Lucas cannot direct (perhaps that explains the animation?).  Also the fades/wipes from one brief scene to another really irritated.'Nuff whingeing.  All up I enjoyed it, gave it 7 out of 10 and will probably see it again.  Any Star Wars film on the big screen is an experience.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Gets to much hate,"Is it a good movie, not really, but to say it's a bad movie is just wrong. After watching it again, it gets way more hate then it deserves. It has a clear story line, with likeable characters, and decent pacing. In all honesty, its 5 times better than episode 8, and 10 times better than episode 9. I actually dont understand why people dislike it so much",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Hardcore fans are a little too critical.,"Say what you will about the prequels. I think hardcore fans are a little too dramatic about how bad they are.The original Star Wars trilogy was a masterpiece and Lucas is a human being. A human being who just wants to make the best movies possible.Sure he didn't need to make them. But, people wanted them bad enough that he made them for his fans.These films aren't the Holiday Special at least. If you want true bastardization then that's the golden standard.For me they were each enjoyable, especially if you like the originals. The scope and atmosphere of the prequels is better then most of the CGI garbage that tries to pass as a film. These films are epics. Sure they have flaws. But, the art direction and visuals alone are enough to admire them. I mean Darth Maul's double light sabre is a epic of epic epicness, I don't care what you say.But, of course the originals are masterpieces, why the prequels are mostly entertainment.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
A lot better than people give it credit for,"Probably earning some sort of reputation as one of the most hated sequels( or prequels actually) of all time, I'm here to say that Star Wars Episode 1 is a lot better than everyone gives it credit for.Now I will admit this is still probably the weakest of the Star Wars movies( that or Episode 2), but its still pretty good. Now talking about the actors, everyone does a pretty good job. Liam Neeson is just awesome as Quigon, with his awesome voice, charisma, and Jedi-like wisdom, he really fits this part quite well. Ewan McGregor was pretty good as Obi-Wan, but didn't really get enough screen time to leave a big impression. Natalie Portman was either good or okay. As the queen, she was oddly monotone for some reason, which seems out of place, but still gets the job done well as the queen and Padme. Jake Lloyd was actually okay. As far as child actors go, you could do much worse, and although he was a little annoying at times, he was still pretty decent.Another big problem people have is Jar Jar Binks, probably one of the most despised fictional characters ever. I actually thought he was pretty good. He could be annoying at times, but other times I found myself chuckling at his stupidity, which I think was the point. Towards the end of the movie he actually does grow up into a somewhat brave and resourceful hero. He could be loud and annoying, but he could also be quiet when necessary, and let other people speak.I do have a gripe with the villain, Dath Maul. Now he looks cool and the final fight a the end of the movie was spectacular, but you didn't really feel any dread of him approaching and he really didn't have a lot to do. But still, he was okay.Not much else to say except that the graphics and visuals are jaw-droppingly beautiful, even by today's standards. You can really feel the artistic creativity in each set and location. The story can be dry at some points, but it could also be suspenseful and action packed. Now I know this movie is far from perfect, with it relying a little too heavily on special effects and there being some underused characters and plot points, but this movie is still really good in my opinion. I recommend this to newcomers and old fans who should give this movie, and the rest of the prequels another shot.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
A Wonderful Introduction to Star Wars before the Empire,"PROS:
-Lucas does a fantastic job of showing how the universe was different before the Empire!-Darth Maul
-The Pod Race Sequence
-Liam Neeson as Qui-Gon Jinn
-The Duel of the Fates
-Ewan McGregor as Obi-Wan Kenobi
-The Music
-Ian McDiarmid
-The Introduction of the Jedi Council.-So much Jedi/Sith lore!!!-""Always two there are. No more, no less. A master and an apprentice""CONS:
-The Dialogue
-Some scenes come off as stiffI really like this movie. I was 10 when I saw it in theaters in 1999. I didn't know it was so hated until around the time Episode II came out. I get the complaints. The dialogue is my biggest complaint of the Prequels in general but I love the story being told across all 3 movies and The Phantom Menace is a great introduction to that story. Qui-Gon Jinn is, in my opinion, the most balanced Jedi in the Saga. He's willing to push against the Council and follow the Will of the Force. The Lightsaber choreography is top tier, as is Ray Park as Darth Maul. He has such a presence without saying much. John Williams is in perfect form here, giving life to some of the more stiff scenes. The Pod Race is still amazing to watch to this day. Seeing the Jedi/Sith in their prime and how their respective Master/Apprentice relationship works. The entire 3rd Act to me is entertaining! I was a part of the Generation the George made this for and the Prequels will always hold a special place in my heart. 7.5/10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Less Jar Jar, More Darth Darth","I feel taken. There is no kinder way to put that. Preparing to see the prequel to some of the most epic films that have been made, I, along with most of the world, became excited at the prospect of a new chapter in the saga. A new chapter that promised to have both the charm and aura of the old while incorporating the new technology of the day. However, instead of the addition of new digital techniques to the epic story, we have the REPLACEMENT thereof.Take, for instance, the idea of a completely digital character. In the words of Ian Malcolm, Jeff Goldblum's character in Jurassic Park, ""Your scientists were so concerned with whether they could do it that they didn't stop to think if they should do it."" Granted, Jar Jar ButtMonkey would have been far less intrusive (say, only as much as a proctological exam) were he not so abrasive and his voice less like the experience of simultaneously chewing aluminum foil and scraping your nails across a blackboard while a band of dwarven accordionists march in clockwise fashion around you playing an atonal interpretational montage of Bette Midler's greatest hits.As far as the rest of the story goes, yes, the Pod Racing and the Light Sabre fight scenes are impressive, but they are not the story. They are simply moments. What we are left with after that is a weak attempt to recapture the audience that IV, V, and VI enthralled. On point, Lucas dialogue has always been ponderous, at best (revisit some of Princess Leah's lines from the originals if you disagree). In truth, he doesn't fail to return on that promise, but the lines do not come off with the same charm that the first movies held; indeed, how could they when the lines themselves are delivered with two-by-four accuracy? I submit the first scene between Amidala and Anakin in the shop of the slave-keeper. The scene is contrived, and the dialogue hollow. The characters are not talking to each other, they are making speeches at one another. Similarly, the scene that should make even the most ardent supporter of Lucas nod a tired nod of acceptance that, yes, this scene needed work: ""I care for you."" Any who have seen the movie know the scene I refer to and can hardly deny the malcontrusion of character and story that forced that line from Anakin prematurely in his relationship with Amidala.I could go on: why try to scientifically explain the ability to use the Force; why demystify what had once been referred to as an ""ancient RELIGION""? I don't mind the allegorical reference to the Christ story (anyone who could not see the parallels in the original movies was asleep), but I do not need the thinly vieled reference to mitochondria that serves as the basis for the most potent power in the universe. Just let it be. Let it be felt rather than explained.My only hope, this film's only saving grace is that it is just a setup for II and III. However, maybe I have already seen II and III and don't know it. Maybe if I use the Lucas Plot-Planner 2000 I can come up with what is going to happen in those films before they are released...Opening: Sinister scene showing ultimate evil-doers planning their ultimately evil things. Spice With: Chase scene (speeders, pod racers, etc.) Include: Yoda Climax: Light sabre duel (Vader and Obi Wan, Vader and Luke, Obi Wan and Darth Maul) or Death Star of some reincarnation.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
I Enjoy this and thats all that matters,"I don't really understand why people dislike Episode I so much. I truly enjoyed this film in the theatres and bought the excellent DVD because of it. I think the movie was just about on par as the other films and was entertaining its own way. Some people claim that its not original or lacks of creativity, which is way off base. Its a Star Wars film so it has to borrow elements fromt the original films to make sense. It wouldn't be a particular interesting film if it was about slave life on Tatooine or the political underpinnings of the Republic Senate. It has to have certain elements from the original films to be a fun film which this film basically was. Granted the plot was a bit complicated and at times convoluted and there was scenes that seemed to drag(the dinner scene, the Anakin-Qui-Gon Stuf, etc.) but on the whole it was generally entertaining. I give this film a 9 out of 10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Definelitely not 6. But not 8 either.,"I generally don't understand why people give such high ratings on this site. I couldn't understand why they gave such low ratings this time.First of all, I am a viewer who watches the movie in order of release, and after watching this movie, I saw that there is no problem in doing so. This is not a spoiler, the first trilogy takes place after the second trilogy. In fact, if you watch the episodes in order, you watch them chronologically. Maybe because you watched the second trilogy first, you'll bond better with the characters, and so some of the events in the first trilogy that I thought were rushed might not appeal to you. However, I am very curious right now. Because I know very well the final versions of the characters. Now I wonder how they got there. So I think there is no problem in watching both ways. If you watch it in order, I don't know how interesting this movie is for an introductory movie. In my opinion, the movie should be watched in the order it came out.That's why I can't consider this movie as an introductory movie. This movie is the 4th movie in the series, no matter what anyone says. And I think it's a great fourth movie. In my opinion, it is difficult to return to the previous times in the following films in serial films, because it is necessary to pay attention to the films that tell the next time. The films should match each other exactly, nothing should contradict. This film, on the other hand, almost exceeds this bar and proceeds in a very harmonious way, even with the first film released years ago. This makes one think that 6 films of this series have already been written, and changing the order of this is an extra move. I think I'm the type of person who is very bothered by the mistakes in movies, and for some reason what people wrote didn't bother me. Of course, some of the things I wrote for other Star Wars movies have not been resolved, but I think this does not mean that this movie is a good one in general (6.5). The effects are grin at first, but then you get used to it. They also deleted the funny explosion effects that they used in the first trilogy, which they were perhaps technologically compelled to use. And now the actors talk like real people. What more do you want?I mean, it's not such a great movie, but I didn't expect to be so impressed with the 4th movie. Be you, watch the movie in release order.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Lucas shows fastball, sneaks by a SLOW changeup...","Well, everyone expected a great film, with a killer story, amazing special effects, and great performances.  What we got was drivel.Yes, I saw and enjoyed the original ""Star Wars"" films, but did not see the need to buy sheets or toys or models or otherwise alter my lifestyle to suit Lucas' marketing machine.  Unfortunately, when reading other reviews, one finds that many have bought into this ""saga"", and have been suckered into this TERRIBLE excuse for a film from a much older George Lucas.What the ""Great Director"" (of five films, no less!) hath wrought is a 2-hour video commercial for his real business, toy and junk merchandising.  There isn't a great moment in this film, and most of it is annoying (Jar Jar Binks, Jake Lloyd) or stupid (the ridiculous underwater city and its inhabitants).  Was that really Oscar-nominated Liam Neeson talking to a flying blue insect, an unintelligible thing with a long tongue and Labrador ears, and a guy with a cool head tattoo and horns?  Wow.  It was amusing to see Samuel Jackson in a film where he didn't swear, but that's it.  Oh, and the pod race with those ridiculous alien characters meant to recall the great chariot race in the second ""Ben Hur""?  I dozed.  As I would expect any adult would, when an annoying eight year old kid is the center of the story, doing ridiculous things (""Gee, I don't know how I just blew up this space station and saved the world, but I better get outta here!"").All in, this film is an insult.  One reviewer even said that he/she didn't really LIKE the characters, but had to see the film again to really understand it (as if multiple viewings will reveal more of WHAT ISN'T THERE).  What a scam.  I'm afraid to ask what films or influences are affecting those who wrote and said this was a good film.  I found it embarrassing and insulting, and a poor example of craft from a guy who's had 20 YEARS to think up a better film that appeals more broadly to ADULTS and kids, as the original films did.  All of the alien characters are ridiculous and highly unoriginal.  A friend who saw ""Phantom Menace"" also noted that the special effects aren't that much better than the original films, either, and ILM is Lucas' real legacy to filmmaking.  Sorry, but the reviewers are right.  This film is MEDIOCRE AT BEST, and is really a subliminal message to buy junk.  Save your money and see ""The Mummy"" or ""Austin Powers"", both of which are a hell of a lot more fun.Rating: 1 out of 10.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Episode 1: The Phantom Menace - Review: 11th June 2003,"Its 1983 and one of the most visually appealing Star Wars movies ever, has been released. The film is Return of the Jedi. We have some of the best set pieces ever commited to celluloid and we see the culmination of characters we have cared about since 1977. We finally see Anakin Skywalker return to the good side and the galactic war is at an end.many years pass then its announced that George Lucas, will create a whole new trilogy, chronicling the life of Anakin Skywalker and explain just why he turned to the `dark side'. The release of the star wars trilogy: special edition only increases the expectation for Episode 1: The Phantom Menace and so it begins. The year is 1999 and the movie begins. Does it start off with General Kenobi and Anakin facing off in the Clone Wars? Does George Lucas enthuse it with hard core mythologizing from the start? Do we find out how good Anakin was as a pilot from the very first frame? Nope.George Lucas goes back to basics. Return of the Jedi was the last film where we had an intergalactic war, but this film is essentially about a small planet being attacked by a Greedy trade federation. Doesn't sound too star warsy does it? Well not on the surface. To fully appreciate this movie you have to accept its not going to the rip roaring roller coaster ride that the originals were. By their very nature they were extremely exciting adventures with characters on the run . In this film, we have a peaceful galaxy as opposted to galaxy engulfed in a intergalactic war spanning hundreds of planets, instead its one planet. That of Naboo, which has came under attack from a Trade Federation. So why start with this planet? Well, Senator Palpatine is the senator from there and as we know, Palpatine, just like Lucas for introducing the films at this unexpected episode is genius for planning ahead. Upon its release, many movie goers attacked Jar Jar what with his bumbling nature he was hardly your typical star wars character and unlike the previous movies, he even had the audacity in acting the fool in the final space battle. But people who let themselves get distracted by this, mis-interpret it and thus, take an instant disliking to the film. But concentrate on what many perceive it to be its flaws and you see that it's the films and overall, the trilogys greatest strength.  It shows how even the smallers things can have a bearing on the bigger picture, from a small time senator of Naboo promoted to the ruler of the galaxy and how the Jedi Knights trigger a count down to their own destruction, by taking a young boy away from his mother. George Lucas should be given credit for trying to do things differently and not hanging off the coat tails of his original films. Had we seen a Han Solo character in this movie like many wanted then it would have cheapened the real Han Solo.  Likewise, many other circumstances which fans wanted in the movie. Sure, the characters dialogue is more stilted, but this is the Victorian area of the star wars universe (you will notice the dialogue loosens up somewhat in Episode 2). So basically, the galaxy is peaceful but theres a few things rumbling and its these smaller things which will shape every film following it. A great epilogue for the star wars movies and a movie which compliments the other films, as opposed to blatantly copying their style and therefore, robbing them of their originality. 3 Stars out of Five.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

A Tremendous Disappointment!,"I have been a 'Star Wars' fan since first seeing it back in 1977 at the age of thirteen. I've seen 'A New Hope' at least twenty times, 'The Empire Strikes Back' about a dozen, and 'Return of the Jedi' more than once. I've read many of the novels and to this day still collect toys and action figures. I spent eight hours in line for tickets and a seat, finally seeing 'The Phantom Menace' on the first day at 3:00 AM. I desperately wanted to like it, and made every attempt to make allowances and keep an open mind.But I couldn't do it. It was just too pathetic.Had this movie been made by someone else, I might not be so critical. But George Lucas has always insisted that cutting-edge effects are secondary to a good story. Too bad someone close to him doesn't remind him of this. I've heard Lucas say he hates to write. Well, it shows. Most scenes are just tedious, obligatory filler material between spectacular effects sequences. Rather than illustrate character through action and behavior, the script delegates that task to other characters to say aloud.Even though the first movies appealed to both children and adults, many defend 'The Phantom Menace' by saying it was made just for kids. But I find it hard to imagine children caring about trade disputes. And the level of violence is more suitable for teens and adults. Besides, how will these children in the audience react in a few years when their hero 'Ani' grows up, turns evil and kills everyone?Perhaps George Lucas' biggest crime is his attempt to explain the Force in scientific terms. This not only contradicted what had been established in the other films, but it eliminated the one thing that distinguished 'Star Wars' from standard science fictions films - an element of fantasy.Although all the archetypes of the original are here: a wide-eyed youth, a wise mentor, an alien sidekick and a royal damsel in distress, this time it doesn't work. Keen characters and witty dialog have been replaced by potty humor and pratfalls. This will be the last 'Star Wars' film I ever see.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Quite good, despite what some people say.","This film was actually really good, and I can't believe some of the reviews it got. While it's not my favorite Star Wars film(Return of the Jedi holds that title), it's still pretty high up there. First, let me just say that I don't get why so many people hated JarJar Binks. He didn't annoy me at all, and I found him to be a funny, worthwhile character who played an important role in helping to defeat the evil Trade Federation. I only had two big problems with this film: 1.Darth Maul was a wasted character, which is a real pity. He could have been an awesome villain if he had appeared in more scenes and been given more lines, instead of only being in a few scenes and having three or four lines. 2. Obi-Wan did not have as big of a part as he could have had, and he should have at least accompanied Qui-Gon to Tatooine. I just felt that Ewan Mcgregor's fine acting skills were wasted.Other than that, though, I liked this movie. The film's best performances came from Liam Neeson and Jake LLoyd. Ian McDiarmid also did quite well as the suave, sinister Senator Palpatine. John Williams did an excellent job composing the film's music. I particularly enjoyed Duel of the Fates(the intense, fast- paced composition played during the climactic lightsaber battle between Darth Maul and the two Jedi) and also the festive, light-hearted music played during the final victory parade.Basically, I just really liked Episode I, and I look forward to seeing Episode II next Spring!",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Worst sci fi since Plan 9 from Outer Space,"Let me just start off by saying, SHAME ON YOU GEORGE LUCAS!  How could you take such a wonderful franchise, the STAR WARS saga, and create such a horrific atrocity?  How dare you violate your fans like this?EPISODE 1 is by far the most vile and retarded science fiction movie I have ever seen.  This movie proved a very strange theory for us all, and that is, that there is no limit to how much money and technology you can expend on a single movie and yet create an end product that is worse than even the lowest budget attempts.  EPISODE 1 assaulted every sense of taste and decency that an average person would have.The plot of the movie is paper thin and yet over-written.  It basically revolves around this SITH lord who using the Trade Federation to exploit some people who live on a peaceful planet.  Some Jedis come along to negotiate peace and the Sith takes the opportunity to try to assasinate them.  Along the way they encounter what must be the most ludicrous and annoying character in cinematic history, Jar Jar Binks, who is a poorly done computer generated monstrosity that attempts to provide comic reliefe for the movie.  His jokes are not funny and most of his lines, including his accent, are racially offensive.  He clearly speaks with a Jamaican accent and refers to the two WHITE Jedis as ""his massa.""  He is not the only character in this pile of garbage to be racially offensive, the evil ""fish people"" of the trade federation deliver their ametuerish lines in an Asian accent.  Anyway, the two Jedis come across an INCREDIBLY annoying little boy named Anakin and blah, blah, blah, blah.  Are you bored reading my review yet?  You should thank me!  This is actually better than the movie!The movie is so poorly written it defies description.  It is on par with your average television Soap Opera.  The lines are banal at best, offensive at their worst, and generally just boring.  The special effects are supposed to be top-of-the-line, ground-breaking, but they are actually just cartoonish.  The over-all look of the movie is what I would call ""Anime gone bad.""Let me point out one aspect of the film that actually bothered me more than any of the other attrocities.  The action-oriented conflict of the movie revolves around one loan bad guy named Darth Maul who is chasing down the Jedis, Obi-Wan and Qui Gon.  He chases them through part of the movie and this sets up the big final fight scene, the show down between them, climaxing in an over-the-top light sabre duel to the death.  One quick criticism:  When did the Jedis start learning Kung Fu?  I guess the Jedi counsel must have gotten a copy of THE MATRIX at some point.  The light sabre fights in the first three movies were much more exciting.  The problem with the light sabre duel in Episode 1, however, is not so much in the choreography, but the premise of the fight itself.  Why is Darth Maul so emphatically chasing the Jedis?  Simply because his master told him to. That is a major lack in character motivation. Why does he attack them both at the same time?  This OBVIOUSLY puts him at a disadvantage.  And this is the real problem.  The end fight is Qui Gon and Obi Wan teaming up against Darth Maul.  This makes Darth Maul the UNDERDOG in the movie!  And audiences always root for the underdog!  So this totally deflates the excitement right from the start.  Not to mention, its pretty stupid of Darth Maul to do this, and it is also not very sinister.  If he was really on ""the dark side"" of the force, would he not wait and attack his prey when they are at a real disadvantage?  Wouldn't that at least be smarter?  And it would make the audience hate him more.  Instead, the audience is not given any such motive on which to base their dislike for Darth Maul.  But hey, he wears black, so I guess he must be evil!  That is LAME!  An audience needs character development in order to really get in to the movie.  Darth Maul is not developed AT ALL!  His story amounts to a scene where his master tells him to go kill the Jedis, and then he attacks the Jedis who escape, and then finally he fights them at the end, and that's it.  This was VERY POORLY DONE!What I believe happened is, George Lucas simply got too big for his own good.  He had too much power and not enough motivation to try harder. When he first made STAR WARS A NEW HOPE, he was really a struggling film maker. He was FORCED to re-work his script, time and time again, making it better and better.  Experimenting with what works and does not work.  The pressure was on to prove himself.  But these days, what does he have to prove?  He is litterally the wealthiest man in Hollywood.  Why waste his time STRIVING for perfection?  What difference did it make to him what the end product of the film amounted to?  It made no difference.  And in fact, the film totally sucked, and yet made a ton of money world wide.  Why?  Simply because he exploited the devoted fans like myself.  This go around, we are the ones who suffered for Lucas' mistakes, not him.  And now, he has gone on to make the next installment, EPISODE 2, which no doubt be just as bad if not WORSE than EPISODE 1.  I would not normally think that a movie could actually be BELOW the low point that EPISODE 1 sank to, but George shocked me and taught me a lesson:  if there is a new low point, he will find it.  And so it seems, EPISODE 2 will in fact exceed 1 in SUCK-i-tude.  Its almost as if he is trying to make the movie worse, he isn't even bothering to shoot it on FILM! And after viewing the trailer for the new movie, it is OBVIOUS that it was shot on Hi Def Video.  Which, by the way, make no mistake, LOOKS LIKE VIDEO! Again, this is substandard to the tradition set forth by the earlier Star Wars films.Shame on you George Lucas!  You should have backed off from this project like you did with Empire Strikes Back.  Irvin Kershner should have been brought in to bail out the new Star Wars projects.  And on that note, is it any real surprize that Empire was the BEST of all the Star Wars movies? Hmmm, could it have anything to do with the fact that George Lucas had almost nothing to do with that film?  George, you need to take note:  NO ONE liked HOWARD THE DUCK.  Therefore, that kind of film making is a TOTAL WASTE!  Jar Jar Binks would not even appeal to a small child, and he did nothing but insult the intelligence of the rest of the audience.Also, the chariot race in Episode 1 was really a low point of the movie. For one thing, it was TOTALLY ripped off from an ANIME movie, so it was not even original.  And isn't it strange that the ""Pod Racer"" video game was released WAY before the movie?  Clearly, that entire scene was put in the movie as nothing more than a marketing ploy so that George Lucas could get even welthier from the sales of that stupid video game.  I would be willing to forgive such a blatant selling out if that scene had actually been worth watching, but as it turned out, it was just as boring as the rest of the movie!And finally, a note to other Star Wars fans:  If you are defending EPISODE 1, you are KIDDING YOURSELF.  We ALL know that movie SUCKED really bad. Now, I say this to you, DO NOT GO SEE ANY MORE STAR WARS MOVIES!  The Star Wars fans should REFUSE to go see EPISODE 2.  I am not going to see it, and I won't even rent it. This is the ONLY way to send a clear message to George Lucas that we will not just sit back and take his crappy attempts.Avoid Episode 1 at ALL COSTS!!!  I am voting this movie a 1, which means AWFUL on the IMDB.  I wish I could vote in the NEGATIVE INTEGERS!",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Star Wars: An Incredible Beginning,"When I was a small kid, I used to wonder what the Star Wars universe was all about. Imperial soldiers, droids, flying spaceships and starfighters, Jedi Knights, Darth Vader, etc. I was curious with all of these stuff but when I watched all the three Star Wars movies, I began to understand what George Lucas, the creator of the popular sci-fi saga itself, was trying to accomplish: explore the awe and wonders of our ever expanding universe. And now, 22 years after the release of the first movie, George Lucas and his entire crew at Lucasfilm bring the most anticipated movie of 1999, Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace. I am truly impressed with this incredible film despite its noticeable flaws. The evil Trade Federation has stopped all shipping to the peaceful planet of Naboo. To resolve that matter, the Galactic Republic decides to dispatch the two Jedi Knights, Obi-Wan Kenobi and Qui-Gon Jinn to the Trade Federation Battleship to arrange a negotiation with the Neimodians. Unfortunately for our heroes, the negotiation never takes place and so they fight face-to-face with thousands of battle droids, escape to Naboo, and there they meet the annoying yet kind-hearted Gungan, Jar Jar Binks as well as the beautiful Queen Amidala (ok, I know some of you out there complaint about her make-up).  Later, our heroes meet Anakin Skywalker, a mysterious boy who is believed to bring the Balance to the Force. In my opinion, Anakin is such a cool person because he is a great podracer who never wins a single match until his recent confrontation with rival Sebulba (he is going to fly a Naboo starfighter too during the battle of Naboo. Bravo to Jake Lloyd!). You need to see the rest of the film if you haven't watched one yet. Episode I: The Phantom Menace is a very enjoyable movie that may even attract those who are not widely known to the Star Wars universe. I especially like the locations on some planets (the Naboo Palace and the wondrous city of Coruscant) as well as its awesome special effects. To heighten up the action, Darth Maul makes an incredible performance during the climatic battle with the Jedi Knights. However, I never say that The Phantom Menace is a 100% perfect movie. The storyline is pretty weak  (gee, I wonder what George Lucas is thinking) and some characters aren't well developed.  Still, this IS just only the beginning, and perhaps there will be a major improvement by the time Episode II is released.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Much better than I remembered,"Episode I is the best movie in the Star Wars prequel trilogy. Now, before you dig your pitchforks and torches from the mothballs, allow me to explain myself. Episode I is universally hated among the Star Wars fans because it was such a disappointment. Our expectations were set too high, and thus we were let down when the new Star Wars film didn't meet the quality of the originals. But, then we realized that we had expected too much, lowered our expectations accordingly and thus the next two films weren't met with such disdain.But, having watched the prequel trilogy again after many years, I can safely say that this film is the one that got closest to being a true Star Wars film. It matches the originals the best in tone, general plot and overall quality. And yes, it is a flawed film in many ways. They made young Anakin Skywalker too saint-like, the pod race scene goes on forever, they started to build the romance too early, the rise of the siths and the Galactic Empire can be seen coming from miles away, they added Jar Jar. The list goes on.But they also got a lot of things right. The plot is actually very good, in my opinion. It starts out excitingly, flows smoothly and actually feels like the original. That is to say, it feels like an adventure. The original films told about galaxy in peril, about a rebel alliance trying to overcome a tyrannical empire, but they told it from the point of view of an individual. Likewise, here we follow two jedi knights attempting to negotiate a peace between two factions and getting tangled into something much bigger and more far-reaching than they had anticipated. And, I can be honest and applaud the next two films for trying to take the franchise into a new direction, but I also have to be honest and admit that it doesn't work very well.The score is also very good, the backgrounds and the various character, tech and costume designs are still absolutely stunning and well-executed, the returning characters are portrayed accurately, most of the new characters work very well and the whole world feels suitably Star Warsian, while also turning back the clock and showing us the galaxy before the tyranny of Darth Sidious.Is it a perfect film? Absolutely not. Does it come close to matching the originals? No. Does it have problems? A lot of them. Is it a bad film and deserving of the scorn heaped upon it? I don't think so.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Outstanding. Disney Star Wars Can't Compete With This,"The soundtrack, the costume designs, the ships, the characters, the locations, podracers, duel of the fates, all are amazing. If you edit out the parts that drag, you get a masterpiece.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

One of the better Star Wars.,"This chapter in the Star Wars Sage is vastly underrated, and is always given the short end of the stick by the so-called Star Wars purists.These are the people that live for the original trilogy and will never ever realize the flaws those movies have, but will always look for anything to criticize about the new ones.That is the wrong attitude to take towards this movie.If you hate the movie because you hate Jar Jar and the Gungans, then you are required to hate The Return of the Jedi because of C-3PO and the Ewoks. Both are equally annoying, yet no one seems to have a problem with the ever obnoxious C-3PO simply because he is in the original. And come on... Ewoks? But I digress...Also, you may hate Jake Lloyd, in which case you should hate Mark Hamill in A New Hope. Bot are equally high pitched and annoying. And both their acting can be criticized to the extreme. At least Jake Lloyd was in only one movie...This movie boasts the best lightsaber duel in the entire Saga, and has the best villain after Darth Vader. The music is flat-out amazing, and the special effects are dazzling.It brings new elements into the Star Wars universe while staying true to old elements. Yoda is still a puppet here, and that counts for a good amount of nostalgia.Criticizing it because the special effects are too good for what is supposed to be a prequel? Come on people... that is lame.Anyway, the reason this movie is so criticized is because people are comparing this one movie to the entire original trilogy instead of looking at it as a stand-alone movie. Which, let's face it, is what it was meant to be.If you come into this movie expecting a fresh, new take on Star Wars which broadens the universe, then you won't be disappointed. If you came here expecting it to be a rehash, remake-style of the originals with no innovations, then why on earth are you still watching movies?Take the movie for what it is, not what you want it to be. Watch it without bias (if that is possible) and you will see that it is brilliant.Why in the world does Episode I have a lower score than Episode II?",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
We've bullied this movie for too long,"Honestly I still will die by the statement that we treat the Star Wars prequels too harshly. While yes, I agree this movie isn't the greatest, when you look at it by itself it may be seen as a bit better.First and probably most obvious is the world building. World building, George Lucas, and Star Wars has always been an incredible mixture. While this movie doesn't astonish us like the original trilogy did with its dense world and incredible factions, this movie gives us an incredible first view at life before the Empire. This movie brings us devices like the separatists, the Jedi council, battle droids, and my personal favorite, the galactic senate. While some may have conflicting opinions about world building elements (I'm looking at you midichlorians) it still is a increasingly successful start and buildup towards the rest of the prequels.Second of all, how can we ignore the soundtrack. John Williams has always done an incredible job of creating fitting music for every scenario. Some incredible tracks such as Duel of Fates and Augie's Great Municipal Band. Music from Star Wars has always been exceptional and a major player in the story and it's no exception with this movie.Finally, we have special effects. Once again this is another aspect where Lucasfilms shines. Personally, the first time I watched The Phantom Menace after my countless time spent watching and rewatching the original trilogy I immediately noticed tje increase in quality in the special effects that came with a passing of time. The special effects of this movie are almost unparalleled to those in other movies of 1999.Overall, yes, it's got cringe, plot holes, midchlorians, and Jar Jar galore, and it is definitely one of my least favorite Star Wars movies. I just think we judge this little film a bit too harshly. Overall The Phantom Menace is a fun time, a good introduction, and a triumphant return of the Star Wars franchise that I will still watch time and time again.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Years Later and Jar Jar Still Makes Me Want to Spit Nails,"The only reason I am writing this review is to revile Jar Jar. You need read no further if you think he was an okay addition to Star Wars.Jar Jar's accent didn't have me yelling ""Racism!"" and his incomprehensible blather didn't have me straining to understand his incessant babbling, either. I knew what he was saying at least 90% of the time-----unfortunately. SO STUPID. He was supposed to be amusing or funny? What an insult to us all.Even the fact that, as so many have said, Lucas added Jar Jar hoping to make the movies more appealing to kids (read: sell more toys)-----I don't care one way or the other.What annoyed the living crap out of me was how horrifyingly asinine the character was. GAH. Every time I saw that *thing* come on the screen, I wanted to heave a box of popcorn at it. Which would have been a neat trick, since I was watching at home and don't have any popcorn boxes around. Har har. Yeah. That's about as funny as anything related to Jar Jar Idiot Thing.All these years later and, as I watched, all I could think was: ""Maybe there's some way Lucas could remake Phantom Menace and somehow replace Jar Jar with a truly interesting and compelling character. Guess that's never gonna happen.At least Lucas got the message and cut Jar Jar's appearances way the hell down in subsequent movies. Shame on Lucas and his team for subjecting us to that lame, lame, lame pos cretinous creature.There. I feel a bit better now. Thanks for listening.",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Impressive!,"George Lucas had his work cut out for him on this movie. First, he had to re-introduce us to characters from the first trilogy and characters who will play important roles in this trilogy.  Second, he had to set the stage for what is to come in episodes 2 and 3 (not to mention the first trilogy). Third, he had to keep things consistent with what we saw in the first trilogy.  Finally, he had to tell a complete story with a beginning, middle, and end.  IMHO, George Lucas succeeded in every way. If you loved Star Wars, you will love this movie. Some people's expectations were too high (though fan-generated hype?), and this lead to a negative backlash against the movie. Some people categorised this movie as a ""kids"" movie (because of its upbeat tone?), but this is a movie that people of *all* ages were meant to enjoy.  This is a great movie!

What the hell????,"I went to see Episode 1 for the fact it was Star Wars, but I have never seen such a pile of crap ever. Poor acting, not aided by the most lifeless and limp script, which gave basic plot details, before being shoved out of the way for the stupid CGI effects. Jar Jar Binks was a disaster, and probably damaged the reputation of this shambles even more. I have never seen such a prime example of commercialism and hype to make a movie a success, it is an insult to young director's who can not raise a measly budget to make their films.

just a great movie!,I liked this movie a lot. The special effects were great and the conversations between the characters was something I liked too. My only problem with the movie was that there were TOO much special effects in it sometimes. The movie would also be great without all the huge actors en effects. my rate: 7,7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
A good start,"This show is wonderful for small children, the audience it seemed to be directed toward. The acting in certain parts (On the part of Jake Lloyd and Natalie Portman in particular) was lacking and shadowed the rest of the movie. Jar Jar was unbearable but enjoyable to small children though, if you were an adult you would rather have clawed your own eyes out then watch a scene with him. Liam Neeson, Ray Park, Ian McDiarmid, Pernilla August were splendid! Ray Park certainly deserved a higher billing then the one he received for he had such presence in all his scenes, and seemed totally engrossed in his role unlike Ewan McGregor who grated on the nerves as a whiny lap dog nipping at Liam Neeson's heels. Lloyd seems to have promise as an actor, though I feel his performance was a bit exaggerated, as if he was trying too hard to be a little boy. The pod-racing scene lasted too long and I found myself wishing I could fast forward to the exciting, suspenseful fight scenes toward the end (Though I admit I was rooting for Maul). Natalie Portman's acting in this movie was poor, especially as Padme Neberrie with extremely odd dialogue between herself and Anakin. She was stiff as the fourteen-year-old Queen and completely detached from her part. Whether that was intentional on the part of Lucas I do not know but I hope she is more bearable next time though it doesn't appear that this talented actress has suffered any from her poor performance in this film. This film seemed more directed toward children then adults, if I was five or six I believe I would have liked it more myself.I saw this movie six times, now own it and have never regretted spending my money on enjoying this lovely film and like it more each time.This is a wonderful start to a legendary saga though the casting was questionable.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
An OK installment ....,"When I first watched this film in theaters, I was very excited cause I was gonna watch Star Wars! I was surprise with this chapter. I was only nine . So as I was all grown up , I've notice that there were many problems with this chapter of Star Wars and I was disappointed.First of all , the acting . I felt most of the actors here have stiff and wooden acting. They were at times both mature and childish particularly with jake's acting . George could've choose someone else to play the part of Anakin. Another bad acting comes from Natalie Portman. Her performance as Padme was very , very stiff . I mean it almost look as if she has no interest in the movie and just go there do her job without commitment or whatsoever. But throughout the prequel trilogy her performance have improved. The only actors I found amusing was Ewan Mcgregor,Samuel L. JAckson and Liam Neeson. They were very easygoing with this film .Second, its the story . I found that the story George made wasn't quite exciting as the original trilogy . I didn't say it was bad but just OK.It could've been better. There were things that I didn't like in the plot. What the hell is with the midichlorian thing? It has already been explained that life exist because of the Force and not because of midichlorians. And why does the universe felt slickier than the original trilogy? The things that I liked about this film is the visual effects, the action and the podracing scenes. The visual effects are a big applause in this movie . It looked so real and so breathtaking. The lightsaber choreograph was awesome. They use elements from real Chinese martial arts skills that made it look more faster than the original trilogy. I especially love the duel between Obi-Wan, Qui-Gon and Darth Mual. I thought the podracing scenes were exilirating. Its even better than real life race . :p So overall this film seems to be an OK film. Its among the lowest of the Star Wars film rankings.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Of course, there were disadvantages, in some shortcomings from the point of view of the plot or the stupidity of certain scenes, but many advantages for me personally close these disadvantages.

A big disappointment,"Like everyone else in the western world, I couldn't wait to see the prequel to the Star Wars movies that I loved as a kid.  I was so disappointed in this movie.

Jar Jar is annoying and needs to take a long walk off a short pier in the next movie. Plus, it didn't take long to figure out what was going to happen.  So maybe it wasn't fully Lucas's fault.  I mean, how concerned are you  going to be when Obi Wan is ""fighting to the death"" with Darth Maul when you remember that Obi Wan is in ""A New Hope""?  This movie is a huge disappointment when compared to the first three.  The special effects are amazing, but other than that it's not worth it.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
A Different Take,"I love the original films, probably ANH most of all. If you saw it on it's original release you had a cinema experience unlike any other. There just weren't films like this being made. Sure, it drew on films and books of the past, but nothing had looked or sounded like this.You have to remember the world we lived in then. Video games were very rudimentary. Even ASTEROIDS was several years in our future. And 2001 was one of the few films to show us convincing views of space travel.STAR WARS was something new with a capital ""N"". Audiences loved it. And it changed movies.By 1999, we'd seen numerous Science Fiction movies, lots of space battles, lots of special effects. And video games had developed a realism that was shocking compared to what we'd had in 1977.Enter THE PHANTOM MENACE. Not only did this film have to live up to memories of the originals, it also had to compete in an entertainment world that had caught up. Lucas could never create an experience as mind-blowing as he had in the original.But he was going to try. And he was also going to try to do a few other different things. The nexus of this new thought was Jar Jar Binks. A CGI creation that was also a character. And a type of character never before seen in the SW Universe, a comic relief character. But more than that, a slapstick comic relief character.In many of the movies that inspired STAR WARS there are such characters. And Lucas wanted to try one in his films.Well, for most, he failed. Many, or at least the most vocal, hated Jar Jar Binks. And few of these people even credited him for trying something new. They didn't want Lucas' STAR WARS. They wanted their STAR WARS. A STAR WARS, it is important to note, that only exists in their minds.In addition, he decided to make Anakin a small boy. Another new decision. STAR WARS had never featured a boy character. Again, the fans whined. They didn't like it. They didn't want Lucas to try new things.But he also gave them what they came to expect. A truly great action set-piece: The pod race. One of the best action set-pieces in the entire series. And he gave them a lightsaber duel unlike any they'd ever seen. But that wasn't enough.Sadly, had Lucas made a film that was little more than a remake of STAR WARS with Anakin in the Luke role, fans would have been happy. And I think that says more about the limited scope of STAR WARS fans than it does about the talents of George Lucas.THE PHANTOM MENACE, like all the films in the series, has it's own unique tone and flavor. And though these flavors may not be to everyone's taste, I think in the coming years more and more fans will come to appreciate this film for what it is, rather than what they wish it would be.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
About as good as the original trilogy.,"I think that people have a bad memory. When the original Star Wars came out, it was not universally loved as some people today believe it was. Sure, now, 34 years later, you can hardly find someone who doesn't claim ""Star Wars"" to be a film classic. But when it was first released in 1977, it was about as loved as Episode I was in 1999 - roughly half loved it and half hated it. It is interesting that nowadays people will talk about how amazing the original trilogy of films were and how terrible the new films are. But people don't seem to remember that they share most of the same characteristics. Here are some examples of what I mean:I hate to say it, but the writing in the original trilogy is hardly Oscar-worthy material. The lines were cliché-ridden but serviceable to progressing the story. Same with the new films.The movies were geared towards kids. Wookies, Jawas, Hutts, and comedic robots aren't exactly grown-up fare. We think these films were more mature than the prequels, but only because they matched our maturity when we first saw them as children or teens.The movies are indeed special effects movies. The only reason the original films didn't use computer graphics is because CGI wasn't practical at the time. Had it been, Lucas surely would have utilized it to its fullest advantage.Both trilogies have political underpinnings. These may be more apparent in the prequels, but are definitely present in the original movies.In the end, they are all just movies, and rather silly ones at that.Now, I am writing this as someone who loves Star Wars as much as the next guy. They are my favorite movies. But I acknowledge that they are just movies and they are not meant to be grand works of art. They are meant to be a fun, entertaining, effect-filled diversion. And to that end, all of the movies are successful. Obviously some episodes are superior to others, but they are each enjoyable in their own way. Nostalgia is the primary reason that the original films are held in such high regard. If we really view these films objectively, perhaps the original films are not as perfect as we remember and the prequels are not as flawed as we think.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Star Wars Episode 1 Isn't THAT Bad,"Personally, I despise the hate for this movie and the prequel trilogy in general. Sure it has it's flaws but every movie has some. At least Lucas tried new things in the prequel trilogy and tried to make it enjoyable. There is a few good things to the prequels like: The excellent music, Darth Maul, the final battle, and more. Besides, people seem to hate this movie because it's boring. Well, the part where Palptine is trying to convince the senate that he is eligible for the rank of chancellor can be interesting if you just PAY ATTENTION!!! Also, people think young Anakin Skywalker is annoying for the most stupid reasons ever made. He's not a brat, or a bad kid... SO WHY!!! I'll admit though, Jar Jar Binks is pretty annoying though I just IGNORE HIM! Finally, to anyone who hates this movie... If you don't like it, ignore it and move on with your life, capiche.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Worth the 3D dollars at the box office,"SPOILER WARNING! Some of my comments may spoil the movie for some.I won't bore you, the reader, with a review of the movie as far as the characters - some more annoying than others, the content, the story, and other like details: Unless you have no interest in Star Wars, or have lived under a rock for the past 13 years, chances are you've at least heard of the movie or have seen it somewhere, and therefore have already formulated your opinions of the movie in that arena.I will therefore concentrate on the 3D experience itself. NOTE: I know I'm late in the game in writing or posting this, and Star Wars: TPM might have left the theater in your area by the time this has posted. I hope not that's not the case, and this is of a help to you.I was sitting in the theater watching the all-too-familiar opening crawl scroll by, and a thought struck me: The natural habitat of Star Wars IS the movie theater. Try as you might (or I for that matter) to buy the most beefed-up home theater system imaginable, there's simply no replacing a movie theater for seeing and/or enjoying some movies, and Star Wars is certainly one of them. Once when I realized that, I sat back, relaxed, forgot about nitpicking apart the 3D, and enjoyed myself.When the 3D shined, it shined extremely well. Example: In the opening sequences, a Jedi ship gets blown up in a Trade Federation starship hangar, and you see smoke and pieces of Jedi ship flying straight towards you. They even enhanced (inserted? who knows?) some pieces so that you can see them flying out toward you through the smoke. On a personal note, I've always wondered - and forgive my naivete here - if the references to ""The Federation"" were really veiled barbs pointed in the direction of Star Trek. I'm sure someone has already answered that question, but that's beside the point..Still, George Lucas seems to be a real stickler for details, and that's readily apparent here. It seems that real care was taken to make sure the 3D quality was superior here, and this is no exception.Another example: The podrace sequence. This is the high point for the movie, 3D-wise, and I won't spoil the movie by going into too much detail. Needless to say, I think you'll find the 3D during this sequence was worth the 3D dollars you'll spend at the box office. Keep an eye out for the all-too-familiar cheap 3D gag. There's one in there, and it's not hard to spot.The point I'm making is - when the 3D was expected to shine well, it never failed to satisfy, and shined at times when I wasn't expecting it to. This happened throughout the movie.Despite what I've said so far, one of the consequences of doing movies in 3D is that between the actual process of making a movie ""3D"" and then viewing the movie with the polarized glasses is that the result viewing experience tends to be dark.I'm sad to say that this is also true of Phantom Menace, and I'm hoping they fix it for the next movie. Outdoor scenes looked like it's constantly just before the sun is about to set - regardless of the actual time of day, nighttime scenes sometimes were difficult to see, sometimes skin tones didn't look right, and other times the actors looked ""pasty"" - for want of a better word.Overall, I would say the 3D was good - not great, but good. I would not go out and completely overhaul my home theater system (such as it is) in anticipation of buying the inevitable Star Wars series in 3D on BluRay when it comes out, and I wouldn't buy the 3D BluRay set just to get it in 3D, but I WOULD go back to the theater to see the rest of the movies in 3D when they come out in the near and not-so-near future in their natural habitat. Can't wait for Ep. 4 and 5! I look forward on seeing the improvements (hopefully) in Attack Of The Clones.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Too good to belong to Star Wars,"The assessment of the Star Wars films seem to be all upside down. To my mind, The Empire Strikes Back from the original trilogy is by far the worst of the six, but it is universally judged to be the best. On the other hand, The Phantom Menace is universally derided, and yet I find it to be the best. It is beautifully scripted; the pace is handled to perfection. The acting all round is superb. The special effects are dazzling, and only gratuitous in the sense that there are too many ugly aliens walking around the periphery. Since this is a problem with all the Star Wars films, TPM should be commended for being restrained, in fact. At least it minimises the ugliness factor by giving the alien characters depth and verisimilitude (utilizing CGI to its limits). Otherwise the effects serve the story very well. Other than the original film, this is the only instalment that never becomes boring and is always engaging.But why does everybody hate it? It was perplexing at first, but then I had another look at the originals and it suddenly dawned on me. One thing we tend to forget is that the original Star Wars films were very ordinary. The hype and the history tend to cloud judgement in this regard. Stars Wars became a phenomenon because it symbolised something vital and crucial for its age. The concept of the Force embodied the morality/religion of the space age. The ground-breaking special effects imbued optimism in the troubled seventies. A fairy tale was told, and people were caught up in the story. They didn't mind that the acting, writing, direction etc was poor. We pretended that the films were good, and we maintained that pretense for a long time. Then came the Phantom Menace, and this really was a menace. It threatened our hallowed pretences. Here was a top quality film calling itself ""Star Wars"", and next to it the original trilogy looked extremely shoddy. The fans couldn't take the exposure, and thus the knee jerk reaction against the new instalment. That's my theory.It is not just a question of improved special effects. Of course there is that. The effects are so advanced in TPM that those in the original film look distinctly prehistoric in comparison. The advance in science is matched by the cinematography, so that we are treated with a vision that is exponentially more grand in every way. But the fans can always persuade us to ignore technical excellence and focus on artistic excellence. That's what the critics of TPM appear to be doing, only that in the process they get stuck on an intransigent bias. The complaint is that the new film is badly acted, poorly directed, overburdened with special effects, boring, inconsistent, peopled with obnoxious and unappealing characters, and so on. It's one big bias, that's all. The fans feel threatened by the new product, and there is a spontaneous rejection. Whatever they are saying about TPM, I will say that the exact opposite is true. It is not only a triumph of filmmaking; it is also the triumphant realisation of a long cherished vision of George Lucas. The man himself has proclaimed that he does not like the original trilogy, not after he has perfected his vision in the later instalments. His legion of fans begs to differ, preferring the inept filmmaking of the young George Lucas, and the wooden interactions of Mark Hamill, Carrie Fischer and Harrison Ford.Of the host of criticisms leveled by the die-hard fans, only one stands up. Yes, midichlorians is a bad idea, and it virtually trashes the mysticism of the Force. But I can see what persuaded the story writers to it. The Jedi Council must grant discipleship to Annakin Skywalker, and the mystical hunches of Qui-Gon are not acceptable as proof of his suitability. It is a major gaffe, and shows that the Jedi Council itself was wrongly conceived. Lucas should have seen that midichlorians are the antithesis of everything that Star Wars stands for. Maybe there's some truth in the charge that Lucas has sold out, lost the original vision, moved over to the dark side of the Force (i.e. succumbed to commercialism). But there is still enough of that vision left to make TPM a truly memorable film. The pod race is said to go on too long, but I didn't think so. People forget the unending battle sequences in the original trilogy The only other issue I would like to bring up is the ugliness of the aliens. It has become a regular feature for science fiction films to feature ugly aliens, and it points to a chronic dearth of vision among such filmmakers. Stars Wars may have started it all, and it has a lot to answer for in that regard. Why should the beautiful future be marred by ugly aliens? These creatures aren't low-life. In fact in most cases they are superior to humans. The model should have been Spock from Star Trek. His alien-ness is suggested by his pointed ears and that is enough. The rest is left to our imagination and that's how it should be. It comes across through his excessive logicalness, his quizzical reaction to human ways, his posture, his special abilities etc. The aura of alien-ness is very strong with Spock; it's almost non-existent with Jar Jar Binks. Spock was the winning grace of Star Trek. Jar Jar Binks, and indeed all other alien life forms in the Star Wars saga, are merely eyesores and annoyances. An alien is supposed to inspire wonder. What has ugliness got to do with that?",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Most underrated Star Wars movie...possibly movie ever!!!,"When I read some of people's comments on Star Wars Episode 1: The Phantom Menace I was slightly dismayed.It is true that it is more of a kid's film; but unless I recall incorrectly weren't the others? It has been criticised for its acting also; and whilst I appreciate the acting wasn't Oscar winning quality the principle cast members like McGreggor, Neeson, Portman, McDiarmind and even Jake Lloyd put in solid performances. I have seen a lot of movies and the acting is nowhere near the bottom in terms of quality.But i think it is safe to say that most of the criticism has been levelled at Jar Jar Binks. The Comic relief is obvious; but I hear you say we have R2 and C3PO for that, true. But surely Jar Jar and the Gungans are meant to act as a comic counterpoint to the more tragic and sombre Naboo...lets face it we need the Gungans because a lot of the time the Naboo are just boring humans. Even Queen Amidala only has rare moments of character exposition when she talks to Ani and when she's off Naboo on Tatooine.Furthermore the movie has been criticised for being too light hearted in nature. After seeing all six it would be difficult to argue that it is the more serious one. But it was meant to be light hearted. When I watched the original trilogy for the 1st time in the cinema in 1997 I imagined what the Galaxy was like ""before the dark times, before the Empire"", and this was the only movie where I got to see that galaxy that had been. This movie was pivotal in setting the context of the mood of the Star Wars Galaxy; predominantly HAPPY yet mixed with political degradation and a far off shroud, barely visible, phantom like waiting to descend on all the Star Wars universe. This is ESSENTIAL as it makes the later fall into chaos all the more relevant. Light hearted and not too serious yes lacklustre..NO! Many people forget that it is part of a Hexilogy of films. The only film that stands on its own is The Original Star Wars...does that make it the best i don't know? This film is the first of 6 it is the introduction, setting the context for what is to come. I feel the problem is many people were expecting a film that jumped straight into the turmoil of war much like the Empire Strikes Back. How sadly they disappointed they were? This film like any other will attract good or bad comments from the critics and the ordinary movie going public..its the division of Star Wars fans that troubles me. How some fail to appreciate it is the larger piece of a puzzle is disturbing. The Star Wars Saga is artificially split into 6 parts. This is the first part. They are naturally adjusted to make individual films. This one is not as exciting as any of the others as it is the beginning the first journey of many..the Star Wars Galaxy is warming up. We will not get the tension we got when we saw Return of the Jedi; the emotional investment will not quite the same even with the characters we have already met such as Obi-Wan; this is because we are aware, despite having seen the original trilogy this is just he beginning. When I first watched A New Hope when Obi-Wan died I recall being more taken with where the body went and grinning at Luke's cheesy cry, than taking in the moment of death. now having seen all six especially the prequel trilogy leading up to Obi-Wan's death it means that much more to me as I now know the HISTORY.The essential problem with TPM is that people were expecting a film as tense and exciting as the first three combined whereas what they got was more if a Luke-warm introduction. What, did you expect George to come out with all guns blazing?!? He's got to have a climax...the Saga if complete has got to start somewhere quieter if it indeed is going to have a climax. Any great Opus has a quiet beginning; the Lord of the Rings for those of you who have read it; has an incredibly slow start; Wagner's Ride of the Valkyries. One of the most intense pieces of music ever has a very quiet slow start. Yes this is a film, and yes different rules apply; which is why it does stand on its own; at least as much as any of the others do. I didn't hear anyone complaining about the Empire Strikes back which has no beginning and simply picks up from where we left off and has no end either. Thats because you'd seen the first Star Wars a few years earlier. Well, now everyone has seen all 6 together I hope this one finally makes a little more sense.But what is most important to me is that I first saw this movie when I was 13, the perfect age, and loved it. I still watch it now, and I still love it. Even more so in fact, knowing it is the first part of what is a great and unforgettable Saga.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Not Perfect, But Much Better Than the Haters Say","So I've started watching the six Star Wars movies so I can go see The Force Awakens. That meant starting with Episode One--The Phantom Menace.This is the one movie of the entire franchise that receives the most hate from fans. People dislike it for Jar Jar Binks, the pod racing, and a handful of other things. One friend recently said that it's a kid's move set in the Star Wars universe. I'm pretty sure they're all just that--but I suppose I comprehend the meaning of the comment there.I tend to disagree with the criticism on most all of the above, though. This is not a perfect film, but it's far from garbage, which is why I've gone with 7/10 stars. There's good and bad here.The good: I personally enjoy the story of the film. We are introduced to some new characters, and to others that we know from the original Star Wars series (Episodes IV-VI). Anakin Skywalker (Darth Vader), Chancellor Valorum (The Emperor), Obi-Wan Kenobi, R2-D2 and C-3PO all make their debuts and all receive origin stories. The overall set up for what is to come is pretty good, in my view, although there are some issues with the plot which I'll get to in a moment.What I do like about the film, oddly enough, is the pod racing scene. It may not be for everybody, but I think it's a cool scene that sets up Anakin's story as a pilot well. I also think the background of his being born into slavery along with his mother is good for the later narrative. And, Princess Amidala is a good, strong character addition for the franchise.I also am not bothered by the political nature of the film, which it sometimes is critiqued for. At least not the part that revolves around Valorem and the Senate. The Jedi Council baffles me.Things I take issue with: Let's start with the Jedi Council. It's a bit later in the film, but without saying too much, basically there's a council of Jedi who are supposed to rule over how Jedi knights do stuff. Qui-Gon Ginn (Liam Neeson) openly disobeys the demands of the council at one point, and it's no big deal. That I thought was strange.Darth Maul is a vastly under-developed character who exists purely for looks. He gets no back story whatsoever, and is one of the poorer elements of the film--despite his being the central antagonist of the movie's climax.The other big thing that I just find weird is the huge age gap between Anakin and Amidala, who we all know are going to eventually have kids together. ""Huge age gap"" may be a slight exaggeration, but Amidala, the female of the pair, is played by an actress who was eighteen at the time, whereas Anakin is a ten year old boy. Maybe that wouldn't be as big of a deal at 28 and 20 or whatever, but the on screen oddity of seeing this young princess who's clearly of age interacting with this little boy, knowing that they're going to be birthing children together, is odd. And then in the next film, the new actor who portrays the now-grown up Anakin (Hayden Christensen) is the same age as Natalie Portman. Strange.All that said, again, this is not a perfect film. But it does have its pluses. I disagree with the suggestion that it's not essential viewing to the overall franchise, as this is the initial chapter in the story of the Obi-Wan/Darth Vader storyline. Again, I give it 7/10 stars.Side Note: I really don't have a big issue with Jar Jar, as I noted above. I did, however, find that the CGI effects on that character looked very odd on Blu Ray. Not the best effects there, which is odd considering the budget of this film.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
One of the most underrated films in history,"I saw the Phantom Menace for the first time when I was 5 years old, and I remember being blown away by what I had watched. It was fantastic through the eyes of a child, something George was clearly trying to do. Now I am an adult, and watching it through the eyes of one, I can see all the mistakes, but that does not make the movie bad.For one, Star Wars has always been a series that has been aimed at children. Yes adults like it also, but Star Wars is not just popular for its films, but for its video games, toys and books. Most of which are for children. This film was great and it showed one of the best adventures of the 90s. When people complain about this film, their excuse is usually the same: too much CGI, poor acting and poor writing and poor direction.Yes the CGI is a bit dated, but it was really spectacular in some scenes. The acting was great in this film, as it was in the next two. The only actor who didn't give the best, was the young Jake Lloyd. It would be unfair to criticise the performance of someone who was a child at the time, of course he was not going to give a Al Pacino performance. The writing is OK, I guess, but really ask yourself this - what Star Wars film has good writing? None. They all have fantastic stories, which is why people love these films so much.George did a great job at expanding on his already loved saga. He gave us new worlds, new characters and showed us the Jedi Order, something we have been wanting to see for a long time. This film is a joyful adventure, with a great story.The character of Jar Jar is often another point of hate from 'older fans'. 'OLDER' fans. To a child, Jar Jar is a funny, clumsy stupid alien who acts insane, much like many Disney cartoon characters. I have a child of my own, and she thinks Jar Jar is hilarious, she is always pointing and laughing at him. THIS IS WHAT GEORGE WANTED!This film will always be criticised by people who just don't like it, or don't want to like it. But this is not a bad film. It starts of an adventure which would eventually lead to episode 6, and the future movies. Star Wars Episode 1 The Phantom Menace is a great film and a fantastic science-fiction movie.9.6/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Not The Star Wars We Grew Up With,"The Phantom Menace is the worst Star Wars movie that has ever been made. Having said that, there is still a lot to like about this movie and it is worth viewing if you have any love for science fiction movies in general or Star Wars in particular. No, this is not as good as the original trilogy. However, the movie does introduce us to characters who we already know and love from the original trilogy in their younger form. The film's characters are not as memorable as the characters in the original trilogy, nor is the story as compelling. There are some very nice special effects, and basically that's what this movie is riding on, the spectacle of the special effects. But it is worth watching, if you can just agree to have fun with the spectacle and ignore the fact that it's not up to previous efforts standards. It's certainly as good as any non-Star Wars scifi action/adventure.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Insane Standards and Romantic Memories Spoil It for Many,"I simply cannot understand folks who say they liked the original series and do not like this film. Maybe it is not a favorite but to out and out disdain it when they so enjoyed the first three is just.....bizarre.Lucas remained faithful with the themes and ideas developed in Star Wars and it plays exactly like the serials that inspired it. It contains similar types of successes and flaws that are in all of films. With excellent performances - (Liam Nesson as Qui Gon) and superb moments (showdown with Darth Maul) along with dud acting (Lucas's direction of children) and tiring exposition.The romantic memory that many cherished from youth was impossible to match. Is the material fresh? hardly - but then again it was not fresh in 1977 - it was new effects and a turning away from the bleak morality of the 70's films that preceded it.Lucas is not doing anything as groundbreaking here - but any scifi fantasy feature film with the level of quality work that this movie had, without the Star Wars label, would have had these same nutty fanboys peeing their collective pants...",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Best out of The Prequels.,"Okay a lot of people are going to hate me for saying that but its true. The Phantom Menace was better then The Clone Wars and far superior than the god awful Revenge Of The Sith. Yes Phantom Menace had that dreadful character Jar Jar Binks but, it also had the best sith lord after Darth Vader: Darth Maul. Darth Maul is a bad-ass, no joke. Anyone who can take on a Jedi Master and his apprentice needs to get ton of kudos.On the downside: The kid that played Anakin Skywalker was just annoying. Same goes for Natalie Portman as Padmae.I give the film a 7/10 cause the action was great and I loved the story. Plus, Darth Maul :)",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Fantastic movie - worthy addition to the star wars saga,"Unlike some other viewers or critics who underrated this movie (and sometimes reviewed before having seen it and made Lucas very angry) I believe it's a fantastic movie, a successful addition to the saga.It's full of action, adventure, incredible jedi-battles with a refreshing hint of politics and diplomacy. (These last two points were absent from the originals since the Empire and the Rebels were in a state of civil war. Check out Star Wars' introduction.)We can see at last see the ""old"" republic and how it worked and functioned; in fact setting the background for the events to come.We have in this movie all the elements of the originals with touches of Lucas' magic: the queen's incredible dresses, the computer generated characters which completely blend in the action, Darth Maul's painted face (which has some asian influence in it) and the human interactions master/student conflicts, tricks, jokes and deceptions.All in all a 10-star movie!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
How does one make a movie to which there is already an ending?,"I am not a child of the Star Wars era, or am I?Before 1999 I had never seen a Star Wars movie in my life (I'm 20 years old). I wondered what all the hype was about. I rented the original trilogy months before The Phantom Menace was released. I liked it very much even though I thought it was a little cheesy and I alredy knew that Darth Vader was Lukes father. But i fell in love with the mythological aspect of the movie.I will never forget the summer of 1999, the summer of Star Wars. My two best friends and I raced to the movie theatre after school on May 16 and sat down to watch Episode 1. I could barely contain myself. The movie finished and I walked out of the theatre with mixed feelings about it. Something was missing. The mythological aspect was not present, in fact almost absent. Nevertheless I enjoyed the movie. I saw the movie two more times in theatres, bought it on VHS and now own it on DVD. I've probably seen it about thirty times by now, and have reached a few conclusions.Q. How does one make a movie to which there is already an ending?A. Stick to the original plan. When George Lucas first planned out his original 6 episode saga. I'm sure that the ending was the best (like in all great stories). Thus, Episode 1 is merely a building block. The story and characters are all part of something bigger. But of course, we're not suppose to know that. Anikin's destiny is not spelled out, unlike Luke's destiny.Q. Why did George Lucas decide to tell his story through political conflicts and not through mythology? Good vs Evil.A. I think the real question is, How does good become evil? I was expecting Anikin to be a poor orphan child clouded in mystery. But, then why would Qui-Gon Jinn want to train such a troubled boy. George Lucas is telling his story as if we have never seen the original trilogy. Therefore we would all assume that Anikin will turn out alright and everyone will be happy. Nothing in the prequel trilogy is black and white. There is no big Evil in Episode 1. It is merely an evil phantom's menace in a civilized era. And like any civilized era, it has its political conflicts.To me the two biggest flaws in this movie were that Anikin did not seem to have a real relationship with his mother and that we were never presented a historical background on the Sith. I really would have wanted to see more Darth Maul, he wastes no time on words. The ending duel is my favorite fight scene of all time.Anyone who blames Jar Jar for their inability to enjoy the movie, obviously doesn't understand much of anything. I am also sick and tired of hearing people say that the special effects aren't good enough. Show me one movie with better special effects.I love this movie even though it could have been better. George Lucas is one of my biggest inspirations. And as I look at all the Star Wars posters and toys in my room, I can't help but wonder how the story ""ends"" 4/5",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
I think George Lucas messed up!,"When I heard Lucas was going to make THREE MORE STAR WARS MOVIES I was really excited.  Then as I started thinking about it I realized that the true and original trilogy was just about perfect.  Would these new films mess all of that up?  My sister said, don't worry it's George Lucas.  I thought about that and was then fully reassured that the new films would be great. When I did go to the movie I was shocked.  It (to me) didn't have any star wars feel to it.  I was at one time a star wars freak.  I think most people go through that stage and then are fans for life.  Some however, are diehard fans. They will stick by Lucas's side through it all.  I am just a fan and was very disappointed in STAR WARS, Episode one.  The acting was terrible, the special effects were way overdone and Lucas lost my faith.  Now those fans who liked phantom menace may be saying that I am no true fan saying this about a star wars movie.  Well, Maybe it's this star wars movie that's saying i am not a real fan. Sorry George. --AdiosP.S. I was also pretty mad that he took one of the best lines from the original trilogy and put into his cash machine movie.

A very nostalgic (but flawed) film,"I remember first seeing this film when it came out in 1999. I was five years old then and I enjoyed. Over the years as I've become interested in film reviews and watched the film multiple times, I started the significant flaws of the movie particularly the dialogue. I understand there's a vocal crowd who passionately hate it, but I never could bring myself to doing so. I can't even dislike. I guess part of it is the nostalgia of the experience, but there's stuff to legitimately like in this movie. Some of the performances like Liam Neeson do a very decent job and while Ewan McGregor doesn't do much as Obi-Wan in this film, he gets better as the Prequels go on. The pod race I very much enjoy (though it could've been shot more interestingly) and the lightsaber duel at the film which saves it for many people is my 2nd favorite lightsaber duel in the film saga (first being the Luke/Vader duel in Empire). Admittedly many performances in the movie don't pan out too well like Jake Lloyd as Anakin Skywalker. Though to be fair he was only 8 years old at the time he was in front of the camera and he got REALLY unnecessary hate after the it came out. In fact due to the hate he went through for his performance it forced him to retire from acting and hasn't been in front of the camera in over a decade. Kinda makes me wanna give the guy a hug for all the visceral hate he got over the years. Then there's the Midi-clorians; honesty I never had any negative opinion about them is I was never so picky with details in movies and pretty much just accept it as is. The one criticism I'd have (at least in Phantom Menace) is that they weren't explained enough. The Clone Wars TV series and the Darth Plagueis novel actually give a really interesting study on midi-clorians. I understand those who despise them feeling it ruins the mystery of the Force (a reason I suspect why J.J. Abrams and Kathleen Kennedy decided to completely exclude any mention of them in The Force Awakens), but it just never edged the wrong way. The Phantom Menace is 100% canon anyway and so are Midi-clorians so people who hate them will have to accept them. A huge mistake I feel Phantom Menace made was killing off Darth Maul (though The Clone Wars later retconed that bringing him back and is 100% canon). Ultimately I hold a lot of positive nostalgia for it even with its flaws. 6.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace (1999),"I suppose I should start calling this ""Confessions of a Star Wars Virgin""... Anyway, I've finally come to the much-maligned prequel series and a movie that gets considerable hate, The Phantom Menace. Maybe because I don't esteem the Star Wars film as the greatest films of all time, or maybe I just have lower standards than most, but I found The Phantom Menace to be the most fun Star Wars movie yet. Yes, there are enormous flaws with Episode I, but like every other film in the series, the good moments don't just excuse the bad; they topple them. The Phantom Menace follows Jedi Knight Qui- God Jinn and his apprentice Obi-Wan Kenobi as they escort Queen Amidala on her travels to the planet Coruscant, hoping to find a peaceful end to an interplanetary trade dispute. They also encounter Anakin Skywalker, before he became a Jedi, who appears to have unusually strong powers of the Force. I was definitely surprised by how much I enjoyed the movie based on how much hate it has received. Being the first movie in a trilogy, The Phantom Menace is going to feature a lot of exposition and many seemingly stock characters. I would hope many of the plot lines and character arcs are continued in the next couple of movies because, but I have to at least give it the benefit of the doubt for now. The movie's good moments made me completely forget many of the bad ones that came before it. The pod race in particular was stunning as well as the final fight with Darth Maul; showing the Jedi in their prime made the lightsaber fights more fast-paced and exciting. Even though I enjoyed the movie, I can completely understand the hatred it has accumulated over the years. If I was a big fan of the original series, and I had to wait sixteen years for this, I would be pretty disappointed as well. Maybe being a Star Wars virgin allowed me to enjoy Episode I more than I should have, but, at least for me, The Phantom Menace was the most visually impressive and maybe even the most fun Star Wars movie yet by continuing to showcase the series' creativity and imagination.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Stinker!,"After Lucas' mentor Joseph Campbell passed away, Lucas lost all sense of real mythmaking and reverted to playground mentality. The plot of this film could have been told in 20 minutes at the beginning of a much better movie. The rest of the film is padded with whopper FX that are supposed to make us ignore the fact that the movie is terribly flimsy.Furthermore, Lucas' choice of the boy to play the future Darth Vader was so far off target as to make the film turn into a cartoon. This boy would be better suited to toothpaste commercials. Consider how much better the film might have been if this one part had gone to the boy who made us really believe THE SIXTH SENSE.This movie is such a radically lower grade piece of storytelling that it lessens the eloquence of the original STAR WARS trilogy.

Looks Better in Retrospect,"When TPM first came out, people were none too impressed, because it had problems, which even Return of the Jedi didn't.  The latter started looking better.  Well, now the same thing has happened.  With the advent of AOTC, I, for one, am looking much more fondly on this much maligned Episode 1. Granted, qualitywise it's not much better a movie then AOTC.  But it's a lot more entertaining.  Probably because Jar Jar isn't nearly as annoying as Hayden Christensen(Sure Jake Lloyd wasn't much good either, but he didn't get as much opportunity to make people cringe as Hayden did, because of the way the part was written).  In fact, one gets the impression that Lucas hadn't entirely gone to seed quite yet when he did this one.  Sure, there are groans, but after watching AOTC, there don't seem so many of them as there once did. Which leaves the question of what will happen to AOTC after Episode III comes out.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
What does so many people hate this movie???,"I dont really know what to say about this movie its like a rollercoster, Some really really cringe and bad moments in this movie but there is also some good moments.
Jake Lloyd and Natalie Portman is just a little too cringe sometimes when they are togheter does it feel like a very bad disney kids tv series.
And why does Ewan Mcgregor have too comentate every thing he does, it gets Much Better in the third but in this its too much.
Overall i like the story of it self, it feels like you are seeing a Star Wars movie, its not boring like attack of the clones in my opinon. A lot of big Starwars fans hate Jar Jar Binks, i dont but that just my opinion. I think Star Wars The Phantom Menace is a overall good movie and a decent Star Wars movie.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Neat movie - Fun and entertaining,"Not as earth shattering as Episode IV, but still lots of fun. The pod race scene was amazing.

One of the best thought through movies.,"I disagree completely with all the people, who criticize the film, because there's nothing really bad in it. George Lucas and  all of the others worked very hard on TPM, and it shows. After seeing the film a couple of times, I am more and more amazed, how good the script is. GL really thought all details through to make an entertaining experience, and there ARE NO PLOT HOLES. I know that a lot of people out there disagree with me on that, but all of the little problems a lot of people have with the plot can be explained with a little thought, and I believe that GL really thought everything through -- he just didn't tell us the whole story. What surprised me was the German dubbing -- it's really good, and sometimes even better than the original version (I've seen both). Unfortunately we all have to wait too long for the next two episodes...",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace,"Hmmm. I watched this again recently hoping that it wasn't as mediocre as I had thought first time around. Sadly, not. The opening scenes are great: a good fight with lots of action and lightsabres; then it descends into a sort of cross between ""Ben Hur"" and ""The Golden Child"" with some pantomime thrown in too. The film is clearly designed to be part one of another trilogy and as such spends way too much of it's time setting the scenes and establishing the characters for the films to follow. We do start to get a sense of the evil ""Palpatine"" and it looks spectacular, but it is basically pretty empty and soulless with a very weak storyline.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
unimaginative and poorly written script,George Lucas really started losing his touch as an artist in Return of the Jedi.  It seems he puts more and more emphasis on the business side of movie making.  I can't wait till the next Star Wars toys start coming out a year in advance.The plot is terrible.  We never know why the Trade Federation is taking over Naboo.  We don't know why  Darth Sideous (aka Palpatine) wishes to do business with the Trade Federation.The character development is dreadful.  I think Darth Maul says 3 lines in the entire movie.  At the end of the movie I feel very little loathing or dread from him.Jar Jar Binks is the most annoying character.  Enough said.Its too bad that Lucas can't be as creative as some of the other Star Wars books and Dark Horse Comics.,1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
one of the best from the series,"Out of the prequels this is my favorite and second from the whole saga(first is empire strikes back).It has great effects, awesome music, good direction and the acting a bit flat at times but over it i am. The pacing might be slow at times but the action makes it over it. The pod racing, battle sequences and Coruscant scenes are the plus points of the movie. It truly doesn't deserve the bashing it gets.A great way to have a foundation of one of the biggest movie series and truly deserving a lot of praise.Nice job George Lucas.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Flawed, but worth seeing","I just saw ""Phantom Menace"" and have to agree with a lot of the basic consensus on the film.  The special effects were outstanding, and I was thrilled to see the huge amount of light saber action in this film.  The set designs were a wonderful eyeful of imagination and art.  Also, the movie held that ""Star Wars"" kind of magic - irresistibly exciting and eventful.Some flaws:1.  This episode lacked the ominous sense of evil the others had.  The main dark presence, Darth Maul, was barely a character (he seemed more out of WWF or a violent video game).2.  I didn't feel like rooting much for any of the good characters; they simply weren't developed well.  For a character who's going to be in the next two, Obi-Wan remains a dull mystery.  I side with those who didn't particularly like young Anakin (or at least, Lloyd's acting) - he came off as a cocky  kid and his line-delivery was rather strained and whiny.  Portman, Neeson, and McGregor were formidable, but boring.  I don't even want to go into the annoying inclusion of Jar Jar Binks (I couldn't understand a word he said and just wanted him to go away).3.  The tempo of the movie was very inconsistent.  At times, scenes passed too slowly and I couldn't wait until they were over. Although exciting at first, the pod race scene became tedious after a few minutes. At other times, the scenes were too frenetic and fast-paced and I found it difficult to keep up with the action. The political subplot was distracting and confusing, and I craved more scenes with the Jedi Counsel (Yoda!!).See it, but remember it's an entertaining event movie, not necessarily a ""great"" one.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Post Sequels Perspective,"Went back and watched this after watching the Sequel trilogy to see how they compare. Conclusion? This is not a good movie. If it weren't for Qui-Gon, Darth Maul, and pod racing this would be an atrocious movie.But it stands out against the sequels because it is actually *trying* to be something new and tell a new story. It actually has a vision. It expands on the universe by showing an entirely different world than the original trilogy. It adds the Republic, the Jedi Council, Midi-chlorians, pod racing, new star fighters, gungans (for better or for worse). What did the sequels add? TFA was largely just a remake of A New Hope. The First Order is no different from The Empire. X/A/Y Wings look almost exactly like X/A/Y Wings. Disney tacked a new shape on the side of TIE fighters every couple of movies and called it a dayThis is a not good movie, but Rise of Skywalker was a pointless movie. At this point I don't know which is worse.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Very close to be considered a tragedy in the series.,"Damn it's been a while since the whole Star Wars enthusiasm hit the world in the late 90's. First, with the Star Wars re-opening world wide in 1997, and then in 1999 with this new entry in the saga.Everybody had high expectations mainly because it had the important task of explaining the origins of the entire series. George Lucas had many years to create the perfect plot, atmosphere, and new characters that would become fan favorites in the future.The result? Well not good news as everybody knows. First, the plot. Although it's not that bad and it explains the important characters fates, it fails when trying to be complex and more interesting. I didn't care for it that much towards the climax. The whole political sub-plots that made these movies famous were absent and it focused mainly on Obi Wan and action sequences. No in depth situations.Then, the new characters were a major let down. Let's not think that success has to do with ""cool looking"" characters; no, it also deals with the character development, background story, and acting. Darth Maul was by far the most interesting character mainly because his martial arts techniques and portray. The whole Jar Jar Binks discussion is old but it will never heal. This character didn't ruin the whole movie because that would be an exaggeration, but the truth is that it increased the cheese factor horribly.The f/x, cinematography, and sound is just perfect as always. The production values are flawless as always but that doesn't save the movie from being a disaster.The movie won't be considered as a failure in the future, but it will be labeled as the weakest in the series.George Lucas thought he had the fans in his pocket but he didn't know about their rage. He didn't satisfy their needs and thought that putting a simple story and tons of action would be enough.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
The hate is over done,"After rewatching the prequels I can't see why PTM is hated so much. Is it perfect? No! But most of the criticism for this film stems from Jar Jar...who isn't in every scene and is just a bit too goofy. Other then that it's a solid film. Good action, good affect, and a unique plot!",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
The Movie which lays the foundations...........,"The story to SW1 is actually very detailed and interesting. Now I will admit the dialogue is not superb, but the story does flow and leaves viewers anticipating the next sequel. This movie is a backdrop - an introduction of the Star Wars Universe, the Republic, the Jedi, Other characters and the Trade Federation. This is not an easy task to accomplish - explaining to viewers where all the elements of the original trilogy come from. I think people were expecting this to be right up there with the first three, but forgot to realize that this movie is the beginning of the saga..... Viewers also complained about the complexity of the plot with all the politics....my thoughts are that we need to be informed of the fragile and crumbling centre of the republic in order to completely understand the birth of the Empire. But now that this has all been done, I believe that the action will kick into full swing with ""Attack of the Clones"" (Episode II) Check out the documentaries on the Official site.....especially ""trying to do my thing"" Take a look at our next Anakin.....I think we all will be pleasantly surprised with what the next movie has to offer. Anyway my rating for The Phantom Menace is a healthy 8.5/10.Good stuff George. Looking forward to the next one.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"An enjoyable film, to say the least.","First off, i'd like to say that the main reason I think people disliked this movie so much is because it had to follow up the original trilogy, and that's like putting the monkees on stage after you've just seen the beatles. You just wanna go home. Compared to the originals, I can see why this was a letdown for most fans. There were a lot of politicians and quiet meetings that were a total snooze-fest, but the only reason we didn't see this in the original trilogy is because the senate no longer exists. If you can get past the politics and Jar-Jar, it's a very good movie. The choreography on the lightsaber battles was incredible, and the battle droids were great. The effects were mind blowing, and the podrace was incredible. It showed us more into the world of star wars, and that's all I could have asked for.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Most disappointing,"This is simply an awful movie: the acting is terrible (with the sole exception of Anikan's mother), the characters unsympathetic and unlovable (Jar Jar Biggs, or whatever, may very well be the worst character ever portrayed in a movie), and the story both lame and incoherent. Special effects and unlimited budget clearly overwhelmed the magic of the first 3 films.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
BRILLIANT,"George Lucas has succeeded once again in creating an awesome movie with great effects, characters, and an ironic, brilliant storyline.  It's great, especially for prior Star Wars fans! I truly recommend it!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Let's get real...,"I am a Star Wars fan, however, I only got to see the original trilogy on it's last VHS release (the original 70's and 80's version) when I was about eight years old. Even so, I got hooked, and loved it to this day.So, when I saw Episode I with my entire family, being the child that it was when it premiered, I was stunned. Loved the effects, loved the action sequences, loved the music (I may be inclined to admit that John Williams was the first film score composer I had met by name and work).Anyway, looking back, I was pretty much left the same. It's not my fan status blinding me, trust me. There are some really annoying aspects in this episode. Of course I'm mentioning Jar Jar Binks. Even as a kid, I thought he was some really stupid and pointless character. The best example I can think of is in the battle against the droids. While our beloved Chewie quickly hijacked an enemy vehicle in Return of the Jedi, stupid Jar Jar stays holding on a tank cannon and isn't able to catch a ""boomer"" in mid-air, neither climb aboard the tank and turn on the rest of the droids.Darth Maul, the coolest of all the villains in the saga, even of all the characters, get's killed off with just fifteen minutes on screen and after delivering less than three lines in the entire film.Acting goes from terrific (Liam Neeson, Ian McDiarmid, Ewan McGregor), to ghastly (Portman and, most especially, Jake Lloyd). The script has many great quotes, but also completely unlikely dialogs (the setting is another galaxy, so that can be defended).The story goes way too political, even though, as a kid, you don't really pay much attention to it. Yet, if you see it as a stand-alone movie, independent of the rest of the chapters, the politics can be useless or irrelevant. But that's about it. You'll get the whole politics better after seeing episodes II & III (in that order).Other than that, it's a great addition to the Star Wars saga. Many people can criticize it for not having anything to do with the original trilogy. Well, hello! It's a prequel. The galaxy wasn't exactly the same for all that time.The visual effects, costume designs and make-up effects are actually flawless (except for the Yoda puppet). The pod race, the duel of the fates (along with the music. Much better than ""Battle of the Heroes"") and the ""Activate the droids"" scenes are my personal favorites.The movie makes a great introduction to a different setting in the whole Galaxy, primarily Coruscant and Naboo, and a ""return"" to Tatooine. We get to see a different world, and get accustomed to it for the next two chapters.It's not the best Episode, I know. It carries Jar Jar's face all over the thing. Still, it's family fun and an additional volume to the saga for every fan.No, George Lucas didn't ruin the saga (fan films do more harm). Just as Anakin, he's just a child in directing. in the next episodes, he has matured.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Meesa not alika thees!,"The Phantom Menace: just the title alone is enough to send shivers up the spine of anyone raised on the original Star Wars trilogy; just what was George Lucas thinking as he penned and directed this long awaited prequel? (being a cynic, I imagine it was the umpteen gazillions of dollars he would make from the sale of toys and commercial tie-ins).Perhaps the most notable thing about the film is it's distinct lack of fun: trade embargo negotiations, taxation, and treaties are enough to bore the restraining bolts off an Artoo unit, and the majority of the cast perform their roles with the dry seriousness expected of a Shakespeare play at the Old Vic, rather than a pulp space opera.But even when his actor's aren't sending us to sleep delivering their monotonous political discourse, good old George fails to entertain, with action scenes ruined by an over reliance on cartoonish CGI and embarrassingly bad slapstick humour (delivered by one of the most irritating creations ever to grace the silver screen, Jar Jar Binks, played by Ahmed Best).Also serving to irritate is Jake Lloyd's pivotal performance as Anakin 'Ooops' Skywalker, which is absolutely dire, the supposedly cute moppet eliciting feelings of murderous rage within this particular viewer rather than the presumably intended sense of pathos at his character's ultimate fate (it's no coincidence that this film marks the end of both Best and Lloyd's movie careers).And don't even get me started on the 'midichlorian' nonsense that robs the whole franchise of its sense of mystery and wonder, Anakin's accidentally saving the day, the woeful waste of the film's best character, Darth Maul, or the film's supposed highlight, the pod race, lacking genuine excitement thanks to its predictable outcome...Oh well, at least John Williams' score was good.",3.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Actually pretty good (but not great),"When this first came out, I got dragged off to see it, and I found it really boring. Recently, I watched it on DVD, with a different mindset, and found it to be pretty good.On the DVD's commentary track, Lucas says that he really intended much of it to be viewed as a silent film. With this in mind, it works really well - the special effects don't just revolve around a single big centrepiece, but cover every inch of the screen - this is a great film to simply -look- at. Yes, there are films with superior effects (and a lot of them are older), but none of them are as imaginative or fully realised as The Phantom Menace. Instead of blowing the entire effects budget on Jar Jar (which a lot of other movies would have done), we get entire races, huge battles, underwater cities and an alien remake of Venice. They might look like they belong in a video game, but realism wasn't ever high on Lucas' agenda, and this even helps the film by creating more of a 'fantasy' atmosphere (This is a fairy tale, not Star Trek).A lot of the criticism levelled at the film is that its characters are underdevelloped and the dialogue is flat. This is why I wasn't that happy with it the first time I saw it. But why the hell was I expecting the elements of a great human drama from Star Wars in the first place? None of the characters in this film are any less realised than those of the original trilogy. But...The major thing missing from Episode One is Han Solo. All the human characters are solemn and dignified, which is why the dialogue suffers - there's no laconic wise guy to act as comic relief and give the story an everyman character (Anakin is too naive for anyone over 10 to connect with). Jar Jar stops everything becoming too bogged-down, but he's... stupid. Not the horrible, movie-destroying monster everyone makes him out to be, but we only laugh -at- him, whereas in the original films, we laughed -with- the characters.The plot is actually quite complex. Not the one that drives the action, but the one behind the scenes, about Palpatine's rise to power. It's full of manipulation, double-crosses, deception, double-double-crosses and all sort of messy stuff. It's just that this story isn't the one that necessarily drives the action, and it's spread out over episodes 1 to 3, rather than being self-contained. I didn't realise just how twisted and Machiavellian it was until I saw Episode 2, and I guess it'll all be revealed in Episode 3. I've never been a huge fan of ""plot"", so this didn't really make me like the film more or less, but still; there's more here than people give it credit for.This isn't really a bad film at all. It might not be as witty or fun as the others in the series, but it doesn't collapse into a pit of plodding self-seriousness like a lot of Sci-Fi, and the action sequences are exciting and colourful as opposed to simply violent.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Clone Wars Made Me Appreciate This Movie More,"Having loved the original films, I absolutely hated this movie when it came out. Jar Jar and the overall bad acting (which is the director's fault) ruined the movie for me and I blocked most of it out. I didn't see any of the subsequent movies except the third (chronologically), and I hated that one, too.But in recent years I watched Andor, the Mandalorian, and Ahsoka and loved them. I also got back on board because women and people of color (and those who are both) were finally meaningfully included in the universe. While in the middle of watching the great animated show Clone Wars, my family watched this movie to fill in some of the lore. Clone Wars habituated me to Jar Jar and made this film far more palatable to me. It's neat to see how much world-building happened here and was expanded on so awesomely in Clone Wars.As a standalone film, this movie still stinks. I blame Lucas-and not the actors!-for the terrible, flat performances, the slapstick ""comedy"" during the Gungan war scenes, and the overlong edit. It's impossible to care about these dull characters. Neeson and Macgregor do a good job but have very little to work with. The costumes and music are also not great. The trade federation villains having Japanese accents is weirdly xenophobic. It all just shows that even creative geniuses like Lucas stumble sometimes.But paired with Clone Wars, this is a watchable film that gives valuable context to a lot of storylines and worlds and sets up all the crucial political maneuvering of Palpatine (that actor, Ian McDermid, is a gem here as elsewhere).",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
The Beginning,"The original trilogy came out before I was born and I didn't see it until the year before TPM came out. My expectations were high and so was everybody else's. In the end I was somewhat disappointed, but I'd been taken on a good ride.    It was a wonderful movie visually and the plot seemed historical in origin. I'll admit the acting and script were on the downside. There were some exceptions though. Liam Neeson was strong in a few scenes and so was Ian Mcdiarmid. You can tell Lucas was not really confident that he could make another SW film. That's why the script was so-so. Jar-Jar is funny in some scenes and annoying in others. Jar-Jar was a risk, but an overall entertaining one. Jake Lloyd was a fair choice for a 9 year old Anakin. Natalie Portman was not given much to work with which is why her performance is just ok.     I have to say I like it overall, we see how things were in the glory days of the galaxy and when Jedi were numerous. The Beginning is an interesting one that starts the most famous saga of all time. It doesn't hold a candle to IV- VI, but it's better than general Hollywood fare.**1/2 out of ****",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

The most enjoyable?,"No, the Prequel Trilogy is not as good. Yes, there are countless things(and this has many) to pick at, some downright cringe-inducing. But if you look at them, and try to choose the best parts, I would say that this fits my summary... for the new ones, of course. And we must decide by some system how viewable these are, because, let's face it... an awful lot of us are going to sit down and take them in, in spite of not expecting to be as into them as the OT(original... yeah), and knowing that we won't really be. My two cents? This is the most overall entertaining and re-watchable of the PT. As far as thrilling and fun light-saber swordplay, choreography, execution(in fact, of all six), yup, the best, all the way. The action, in general, receives top marks, as well. The villain... do I need to describe its awesomeness? If you have no idea what I mean, you probably haven't seen the film. The score... magnificent. There are beautiful images in this. But yes, there are awful moments herein... you've likely at least heard of them. The comedy takes a bit of a dive, with more than one piece of toilet humor(and there's a reason the slapstick isn't that popular, although there are exceptions). The acting could be better, but that goes for most of Star Wars(be honest now, people)(meanwhile, Neeson... wonderfully cast). Character writing, especially for the leads, could be more fresh for the franchise. The plot isn't bad, and develops reasonably. The pacing is adequate. The effects are pretty spectacular, if not always real-looking, but it only gets worse in the latter area, and some practical ones are still used here. The dialog is the least embarrassing of these three. The design is great. The DVD has trailers, TV-spots, about twenty(do note that length vary and not all have running times that go beyond ten minutes) featurettes, deleted scenes and a commentary track. I recommend this to fans of the series, George Lucas, and Ray Park(who rocks). 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

A Good Prequel,"Introduction:The Phantom Menace is a good movie. I'm not afraid to say it. I think it's a good movie. I believe the criticisms against this film, are invalid. They should be reevaluated. And like many, I use to hate the film, and be another sheep. But upon thinking it over, thinking about the problems with the film, and the criticisms that I knew were weak or hypocritical: and I came to the conclusion that the Phantom Menace is a good movie. It's probably my least favorite prequel, but I still enjoy it. The Phantom Menace is a criminally underrated movie, that gets unnecessary amounts of hate.Defense:Common criticism and complaints against the Phantom Menace include, a bad script, bad acting, too much needless CGI, and Jar Jar Binks. I believe all these criticisms are ridiculous and invalid.1. Bad ScriptThe supposed horrible script is not amazing, but it's certainly not terrible. Many complain that the film contradicts the original trilogy, with mediclorians. As according to the film, they are the force. Which is not true. They are a way of measuring the force. They are not the force itself. So it doesn't contradict what Yoda said. Or many might complain that it removes the fantasy elements from the films. No it doesn't, because the organisms are not the force itself. And even if it does, so what? I don't see the problem. Look at this film's IMDb page, and look at the genres, it is labeled as a fantasy film.But that's not what people complain most about, it's the badly written characters, or the fact the film doesn't a center character. But are they badly written? I would say no. And I believe the center characters are Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan, it can have two. I will discuss all the characters, and explain how they are written fine.Qui-Jon is a Jedi master who doesn't fully believe in the Jedi Code, an important part of this trilogy. He is not a slave of the Jedi teachings, and can often disagree with them. Obi-Wan is very different from that, he is a little more devoted to the Jedi teachings. Anakin is a hopeful little slave boy, who has a dark future ahead of him. And many might complain about the choice to make Anakin 9 years old. But George Lucas, who created Star Wars, as creator has the freedom to do what he wants. And can really only be criticized in this field if he contradicts himself, which he doesn't do. Padme, even though he puts up a bland and emotionless exterior, shows more emotion, when she's not performing her duties as Queen.Darth Sidious is the dark puppet-master of the films events. Manipulating the characters, and planning bigger things for the future. Darth Maul is his emotionless assassin, who hunts down and kills who he's told to, without mercy. So I never got this argument.Also, many complain that the characters aren't focused on enough. But, if it was a character driven story, it is a valid criticism. But it's not, it's a setting driven story. As they go from location to location. And galactic politics mostly drives the story. So the characters are focused on enough for this kind of story.So, the criticism of the writing has been debunked.2. Bad ActingThe supposed bad acting in this film is another criticism I don't understand. If this was any other film, it would be bad. But in the context of the film, the performances make sense. The Jedi are established as emotionless, and as I mentioned before, when Padme was being the Queen of Naboo, she would put on a bland exterior. But when not performing her queenly duties, she was quite a fun person.And the acting of Jake Lloyd wasn't terrible, as he acted like a real child. And the chemistry he had with the actor playing his mother was very convincing.I think the claim that the film has bad acting needs to be better thought out. Because the way this film is written, the acting serves it's intended purpose, and is bland by design.3. Needless CGIPeople complain that the effects and CGI is overdone and unnecessary. Well, what if I told you the criticism is invalid? And that the film the has more practical effects than CGI? The film has real sets, real props, and real models. The Naboo Palace was a set that was built. Many of the ships they fly in were real models and actual sets. And many of the pod-racers were actual models built. And well yes, there is CGI. That shouldn't be criticized.At the time it looked amazing. Jar Jar Binks, love him or hate him, was the first fully CGI character. Which should be commended not condemned. How come when somebody revolutionizes film making, they are praised, someone like Dziga Vertov, who pioneered many filming techniques in the 1920's, technique still used today? But when George Lucas does something arguably more inventive, he's hated? It's hypocrisy!4. Jar Jar BinksNow here's the elephant in the room, Jar Jar Binks is a terrible character. And I agree with this one, mostly. Many claim Jar Jar is pointless, and doesn't add anything. And you can hate this characters all you want, I'm that big a fan of him. If you don't like a character, that's fine. My issue the fact that many claim he's pointless. When he isn't, if our heroes didn't come across him, how would they get to the Gungan City. They didn't know where it was. But no, pointless. He also serves the purpose of being comedy relief. Something C-3PO and R2-D2 did, and personally, I wan't a fan of them either. Jar Jar Binks is fine, and so is R2 and 3PO.Conclusion:After debunking all that criticism, is your mind changed? If not, that's fine. Your opinion is your's to have. And I shouldn't force you to like something. The film is not 100% perfect, but it's not deserving of hate.

The Farcical Menace More Like,"Never been a STAR WARS fan and I fail to see what the fuss was about with the original trilogy , but I`m shocked as to how even the most die hard fan could have enjoyed this movie . In fact I`ll be even more blunt - I`m surprised as to how the film company allowed George Lucas to release this movie !First of all there`s absolutely no coherance to the script . The first 25 minutes are composed of characters escaping from CGI monsters only to be confronted by other CGI monsters ( Is this why it`s called THE PHANTOM MENACE ? ) then some vague mention of trade wars then it`s back onto the FX again . Not that the FX are up to much even the explosions are obviously done by CGI , no technical triumphs here . And the other technical aspects are very poor especially the editing . Has everyone failed to notice the tme discrepancys between scenes ? We see one character captured by war droids then it cuts to another scene which seems to last several minutes then it cuts back to the war droid scene where it seems no time has passed at all. THE PHANTOM MENACE is full of this haphazard editing which leads me to believe it wasn`t edited at all. But the two things that really got my goat were the war driods and the acting .First of all the war driods are complete wimps ( And yes they are CGI ) I mean we have about three dozen droids armed with lazer guns trying to kill a couple of Jedi knights armed with light sabres . Guess who wins ? Correct . This lack of a credible enemy undermines an already poor film where we know that our heros will never be in serious danger now matter how many driods they come up against . A few people have made similar complaints about FELLOWSHIP OF THE RINGS , but the enemy in FELLOWSHIP have identical weapons whereas here the good guys are heavily outgunned as well as being heavily outnumbered and it`s laughable to watch a small handfull of people waving their light sabres against hundreds of well armed droids.Secondly the acting . We can sit here and discuss what "" Bad "" acting is . For me the worst type of acting is wooden acting . Gasp in amazement as a host of well regarded stars read their lines as if they`re reading out a shopping list . Neeson is wooden , Jackson and Stamp make no impact but worst of all is Portman whose performance is so bad it has to be seen to be believed and which left me scratching my head puzzled as to why she got payed for her performance . The only two performances that stuck out was Frank Oz and Ewan McGregor and even then that`s down to his implaceble irritating accent.And before anyone accuses me of not liking the fantasy genre I will say I absolutely loved FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING and will be booking my ticket to see THE TWO TOWERS when its released .

The best of the series,"I never care what people say about movies, because the fact is that the most people are too lazy to think for themselves or are afraid not being taken seriously otherwise and just repeat the meaning of other people.I like the whole series but this is my favorite part, mainly because of the great action sequences.

By no means disappointing,"Now, despite being pretty much a sci fi geek, I wasn't actually aware of Star Wars until the Digitally Remastered box set was released, and as such Episode 1 was the first Star Wars film I saw in the cinema, and I was stunned. It had almost everything, interesting new (or rather, old) technology, nice glimpses into different cultures, fantastic graphics, I'd go as far as to say it was the first film in ages that I felt came close to the standard set by Jurassic Park and awesome sound, the pulsing of Sebulba's Pod Racer's engines as he flew past took my breath away. I left the cinema absolutely wowed, I wouldn't have faulted the film at all. When it was released on video I bought it straight away, and it was the first film I noticed as being somewhat... lacking on video, to me it is very much a film built for the cinema. Furthermore, on about the third or fourth overall watching that critical factor began kicking in. The Jar Jar factor. I'd never much noticed him the two times I saw it in the cinema, in fact the second time I was very much on a ""I don't see what's wrong with Jar Jar"" vibe upon leaving, but for some reason I really saw him on the TV, and I suddenly saw what the big problem was. I also started getting a bit annoyed by the Annakin character, well, more annoyed at the acting than the character. Obviously you can't really expect a child role to be impeccably acted, but I've seen better.Now, since the original trilogy were never such an intimate part of my early life I fail to get so passionately embittered about the folly that is Mr. Binks, but I would say he spoilt an otherwise decent film, I actually find him literally cringeworthy, which doesn't often happen. However, I definitely find the incessant ""jumped up toy advert"" claims unjustifiably harsh (especially since I can't for the life of me find a decent model Destroyer Droid!) and Binks aside I thought the film was more or less all I'd hoped for.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

A good re-entry of the best franchise,"A lot of people have complained about this movie being the worst movie. I can tell you hear that the worst movie I have seen is Son of the Mask. Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace, I believe, is a good re-entry of the well known franchise we come to know and love. Now, I said good, not the best, and I'm a Star Wars fan. I tell you it is good because of a few things. One, the script did not exactly hit the mark like it did with the original trilogy. Two, the movie introduced a character that was a bit too childish and annoying to be a comic relief. And finally, the actor who played young Anakin was not the best choice. I hear that the script was terrible, it was too childish, the acting was wooden, it had too many special effects, and it was overall, a bad movie. But there are a few points I would like to make: 1. It is difficult for George Lucas to come up with good quality prequels that has been shelved for 22 years. 2. Lucas has made special effects more realistic since the first movie. He is trying to push the boundaries with that technology. Besides, the reason he didn't have the prequels is because he didn't have the special effects he needed to make them. 3. It's a kid's movie. Don't be too rash on the film, calling it too childish. You were kids when you saw the first movie and you liked it. Now let your kids enjoy this movie. Just because you got older and more mature doesn't mean Star Wars won't grow older and more mature. 4. The reason for the movie to be very political is because it reflects on ourand the world's government. It shows us of how a government could fall over greed and power. 5. Jar Jar Binks is there because C-3PO and R2-D2 didn't exist as comic reliefs. Jar Jar maybe annoying and a little childish, but it shows us of the childish nature within ourselves.My final word, I believe it's a good, not the best, re-entry of the franchise.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
The Phantom Menace Stinks!,"I can't believe how complete awful The Phantom Menace was! This film had no plot, originality, or storyline.

Also, the numerous Razzie (Worst of the year) awards just goes to show how awful this film was.The Phantom Menace feels NOTHING like the classic Star Wars trilogy. Let's hope that Episodes II (Attack of the Clones) and III (Fall of the Republic?) are a 1000 times better than the complete travesty that is The Phantom Menace!

Original ideas but killed by the pacing,"Star Wars the Phatom Manace is a whole different approach to the Franchise. Unlike its predecessors, it focuses more on the political and bureaucratic spectrum, perhaps in excess, as the pacing is significantly affected making the story difficult and sometimes boring to follow. Even so, the movie manages to introduce some interesting material to the Universe and revolutionary action scenes such as the Pod Race and Duel of the Fates.Subsequently, the film ends up losing points due to disappointing effects, poorly directed acting and very unorthodox dialogue.The characters notably suffer from a lack of characterization and development which doesn't help to invest the audience in the story.With that being said, this film does a good job bringing new and original content but fails to reach the atmosphere fans wanted as it delivers a slow pace and some uninteresting topics.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
How bad would a movie have to be to completely RUIN the Star Wars franchise?

The only good part about this movie was that the music was done by John Williams and we will never (fingers-crossed) have to worry about a ""Special"" edition coming out.Don't waste your time or money. Stick with the original trilogy. I really, honestly believe that George Lucas was trying to make the worst possible movie he could make. He succeeded.

A Big Disappointment,"Let me introduce myself. I am a huge Star Wars fan from time before prequels. By the time this movie was released I had seen the original trilogy many times and fell in love with them. When this movie was released I was very excited! I was 10 years old and perfect audience for this film. I remember having goose bumps at the title screen as I had when I saw ""Star Wars"" special edition in 1997 in theaters.After the title screen I really could not understand much from the film. This is so called ""kids film"" but actually the whole plot is something so complicated even adults can't figure it out. At the time I didn't think it was a bad movie I just couldn't think it at all. Maybe I remembered the characters in it. That's all! The reason I have not made much opinions about the film before is that I never have watched the movie with a real focus of what is happening. That is because I have always lost my interest while watching. The movie has become more awful every time I watch it. So I finally must admit my disappointment to this film: It is awful.The film consists great action but the plot and characters (not actors) are so dull and uninteresting that I simply don't care what is happening. I have seen ""Phantom Menace"" many times and the original trilogy countless times and I usually like watching movies with thought.Now I reveal my secret of understanding this film: redlettermedia ""Star Wars"" reviews at: http://redlettermedia.com/plinkett/star-wars/ I recommend watching those reviews because they explain so much of the films in great detail. It is great that someone had the dedication to analyze those films because I couldn't do it personally.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
A misunderstood movie,Are the Star Wars Prequels clunky? I guess. Do they often have cringy dialogue that make you wish Lucas got a different writer for?

I have grown to love the political intricacies that came with the prequels. The story of Palpatine and his rise to Emperor is flawlessly done. The overarching political scope might be a little much for some but I find it fascinating. The best part of this movie is the fight between Maul and Kenobi/Jinn. It is phenomenal.

One chapter of a much larger story (3-D update),"It's kind of hard to review this because I don't see this as one movie, but as a chapter part of one larger story. The reason why I say this is cause George Lucas once said that every Star Wars film are intended to be one big movie split into six parts telling a very complex story. I actually think of this an underrated film cause a lot of people don't listen to what George Lucas has to say of the Star Wars saga is intended to be and how it's to be structured. On it's own, I'd probably rate it as a six or seven out of 10. But as a part of a larger story, it gets a 10 out of 10 cause in the long run, it's the very elements of what happens in the film that really make it matter in the Star Wars saga. If you disagree with me about what I say the structure is, just send me a message or place a comment.I saw The Phantom Menace twice in 3-D. The first time was the day it was released Feb., 10 and the second time was with my sister on the Feb., 20. Overall, I thought the post 3-D conversion was fairly impressive and it was worth seeing it again after nearly 13 years of its original release. Probably the most impressive 3-D shots were with the holograms and some lightsaber fight scenes. You could also see Jar Jar's tongue stick out of the screen in one shot. My eyes did strain a little bit at times with the transition from shots that were dark and kind of dole colored to very bright colored shots. But that's my only problem with the 3-D conversion. It was worth going to see again and recommend to any hard core star wars and general moviegoers.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"A good film in it's own right, though by far the weakest of the Star Wars films","The Phantom Menace was a good film. However, the fact that it was inferior to the other films cannot be denied even by die-hard fans of Star Wars.As has been repeated thousands of times, Jar-Jar is representative of the lack of effort on Lucas' part. He is annoying, and seems out of place amongst the serious message Lucas is trying to spread. If his antics had been turned down a couple of notches, the the film would have received an 8. But Jar-Jar seems to be an overdose of comic relief in near-fatal amounts. Perhaps if he was in another film, one which tolerated his behavior, then I might see things differently. But for me, R2 and 3P0 were as funny as the Star Wars films SHOULD get, because they kept the audience laughing without disrupting the plot. (Lucas apparently fixed this Jar-Jar flaw by reducing his screen time in Episode II and allowing him to indirectly cause the rise of the empire) Another thing was the child Anakin. This kid was also annoying. Lucas said that his behavior was to signify the innocence of Anakin, but for me it signified why some animals eat their young. Not to mention that this version of Anakin was so different from the version seen in the next film, and although this can be explained with time, it still seems a little much. He has fulfilled his dream of becoming a Jedi in number II, yet he is more depressed. Not seeing the connection. Now, Jake Lloyd is not to be blamed; he's ten years old, and most children don't have acting skills at 10 years old. No, I blame Lucas for even casting him in the first place. I think that a 13-14 year old Anakin would have been WAAAYY more believable.Darth Maul...an awesome-looking villain, kicks Jedi *** in the climax of the film, but he had had so little character development, and with one line of dialogue, he barely stood out from the droids (which were very well-done; the concept of a droid army, was, in my opinion, one of Lucas' greater ideas in the film).The force being explained through science? I need not speak. Part of the fun of the original trilogy was the combination of magic and technology, and the fine line dividing them. Lucas obliterated this line in a fiery explosion. Mysticism: Gone. Or at least diminished.The podracing scene was an excellent concept, but executed in a disappointing fashion. And the climax of the film, with Anakin and the Droid Control Ship: unbelievable. Really. It was very cheesy. (If the Anakin was older and more mature, then I would have believed it).Qui-Gon was brilliantly played, although I was disappointed by his lack of a role in the other two prequels. The last bone I have to pick is the lack of Obi-Wan's screen time. One of the most influential characters in cinema history only gets a few lines of dialogue throughout most of the film, and he only shines in the end in the climactic duel with Darth Maul.Now, I just gave this film what seems to be a negative review. However, in contrast to everything previously mentioned, I enjoyed it. It was a good film. Worth the watch. It just....was disappointing when I realized it was supposed to be Star Wars. STAR WARS, people! Overall, I give it a 7, minus 1 for Binks, minus 1 for Dennis the - sorry, Anakin in a out-of-place role, and 2 for the fact that it failed to live up to one of the greatest expectations for a film in the modern times.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

This movie brought amazing new technology from the old Star Wars, and also wrapped up the awesome ties between old and new. It also brought us some awesome new characters.

A Missed Opportunity,"A Phantom Menace is a victim of poor directing/writing on Lucas's part. Rather than providing an introduction to the Star Wars saga, the film drops you into the middle of a conflict that's not properly unfolded(hence the long intro to the movie), and revolves around a battle that, while a good story on its own, has nothing to do with the Star Wars films we know and love.This is particularly disappointing because what else there is in the movie is really quite good. The whole background of Anakin Skywalker is excellent (the future Darth Vader starting out as a slave boy on a remote planet is brilliance), and his introduction to the Jedi Council is a bittersweet moment seasoned with dramatic irony. There is also the introduction of the Sith, Coruscant, the Senate and, of course, the Jedi, which are mentioned or referred to numerous times in the original trilogy, but never fully revealed.The special effects, while impressive, are only a taste of what will come in the next two prequels: incredible abuse of the CGI technology Lucas has at his fingertips. Nevertheless, the space battles are akin to what we're familiar with, the pod racing is an instant classic, and the lightsaber duels are breathtaking.In spite of the high points of the film, The Phantom Menace is a real disappointment. It's a clunky ""introduction"" that is odd compared to the original trilogy no matter how you look at it, littered with cheesy lines, bad costumes, bad directing, things thrown in only for nostalgia's sake (C-3P0 really should not have been in this movie), contradictions to the original films, and of course, Jar-Jar. But Gungans or no Gungans, this film can only be seen as bitter medicine that must be swallowed by Star Wars fans. Fortunately, the prequels get slightly better as they go on, but they still stand best as a separate trilogy, no matter how desperately Lucas tries to tie the two together.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
The greatest cinematic disappointment of my life,"""Star Wars"" (1977) represents the birth of my love for cinema.  As a child I had seen movies before it but nothing before had gripped me with the wonder and excitement of this film.Like everyone else I had given up any hope that there would be a Star Wars film after ""Return of the Jedi"". The whole idea of a prequel seemed like an urban myth.  It is thus difficult to explain my excitement when the project began to materialize.  In fact, I count the experience of watching the trailer for ""The Phantom Menace"" in the theater as an event almost comparable to viewing the original films- such was my keen desire.I went opening night and saw the film.  I can never be as disappointed again with a film as I was with the failure of ""The Phantom Menace"".Now you could say that no film could have met the astronomical expectations that I set forth.  Perhaps that is correct, I will never know.  What I can tell you though is that this film is not in the same league as the others in this series and I will tell you why.It is not because of Jar Jar Binks (though every negative thing said about him is correct), it is because the film has no heart.  What is the center of the first Star Wars trilogy?  It is the relationship between Han and Luke and Leia.  In particular, it is Han Solo who is the spark of life.  Han Solo has personality, he has character, and he has humanity.  Luke, Ben, Vader- they are more or less sterile and that describes the entire cast of ""The Phantom Menace"".The reason the film doesn't work is that we don't care what happens to these people. The portrayal of Anakin is particularly bad. Does anyone buy for a second that this child is a slave, or that he is saddened to leave his mother?  I see a child actor smiling and trying to be cute. Period.The jedi characters may suppress their emotions intentionally but it doesn't make for interesting screen time. As a counter-example, in the ""Star Trek"" television series the logical character of Spock only really works because he can play off the cantankerous country doctor role of Dr. McCoy and to a lesser extent Captain Kirk.  Without a foil to play against cold logic is just that- cold.This is another reason that the Jar Jar Binks character was such a poor choice.  His place in the cast could have been filled by a more substantial role that played off against the jedi and offered Anakin a different choice of paths.  Instead we get a slapstick routine that is geared towards infants.  And I do mean infants not children.  I remember seeing the original movie as a child and I would have considered Jar Jar ""babyish"" even then.  R2D2 and C3P0 work well to provide humor; there was no need to double up.I think it is obvious that George Lucas has become blinded by special effects, and marketing reports.  He has forgotten that the magic of Star Wars had nothing to do with CGI.  The line ""Don't get cocky kid"" is worth more to me than a hundred digitally created creatures or trips under water.As a movie in its own right the film is unremarkable.  Some of the special effects are a tour-de-force of digital magic.  However, some of the effects fall quite flat.  There is a battle on a field at one point in the film and it is painfully apparent that we are looking at a video game and not reality. I have never in my life seen a field that is a uniform glaring green.  Perhaps if the scope of the digital effects had been scaled back a bit what was left would show to better result.  (After all, is this a film or the resume for Industrial Light and Magic?)  But all things considered the film in its own right can stand on even footing with other space opera offerings.  It is when it is compared to its predecessors that it collapses.I guess you can never go back and relive the excitement of childhood.  I just didn't need the door slammed so violently in my face.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

"Great film, unjustly critizised.","It's now been three years since I first saw this film, and I've seen it 7 or 8 times since then. The thing that strikes me is that this is a really good action adventure. It is not as good as the original trilogy or Episode II: Attack Of The Clones, and yes it's flawed. It's flat in places, and Jar Jar has too much screen time. Apart from those minor gripes it is a fantastically entertaining and exciting piece of movie making with some of the best action set-pieces ever filmed, like the Pod race and the end Lightsaber duel.The music, as always very good. As are the sound effects (I still can't believe they didn't win the Oscar in that category).So in hindsight, avoiding all the hype, I can say that I still enjoy this film immensely and will probably see it many times in the years to come.Rating:9/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
At Least it Felt Real,"With the entire prequel trilogy now out, I look back at The Phantom Menace with a bit more kindness than I might have without the other movies. The first of the new movies is certainly no masterpiece outside its technological achievements: most of the actors give weak, stilted and/or just plain awkward performances (Liam Neeson, Ewan McGregor and Ian McDiarmid among the saving graces) and the story was often too silly, among other things.But the one thing I realize looking back at this movie is that it FEELS real...something that's lost as Lucas moved to digital backgrounds and characters for almost everything in the later movies. Depending more on real locations, real stunts and real characters (more often than the other two, anyway), this movie doesn't lose itself in boundlessness that plagued the next two films, which were often overdone to the point of feeling like a glitzy made-for-TV movie (the Matrix sequels made this same mistake). The lightsaber battles of the Phantom Menace are still easily the best of the Star Wars films, sticking mainly to the limits of stuntmen (with some necessary exceptions) and not trying to turn the Jedi into godlike warriors.Episode I may not be a great film, but the action's still plenty of fun, and the movie itself may be the last to give you that feel of the classic Star Wars films before moving on to things bigger and brighter, though not necessarily better.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Good movie but not extraordinary !,"Well i must confess before commenting this movie that i'm a great Star Trek fan and anyone know the great rivality between the fan of the two franchises.  Well i never hate Star Wars but more the hardcore fans of SW who often attack Star Trek without great arguments like the Star Destroyer is bigger than the Entreprise so Star Wars is better than Star Trek you see what i'm talking about..., this debate is another story so it would be all for this...  So i go see this movie with the betters intentions in the world i also try to be objective and i put my Vulcan logic aside to replace it by the mythological and the fairy tales stuff of Lucas... Well its a good movie with beautiful eyes candies the space ships are beautiful and all this stuff ... But what about the characters. i left with the impression they have nothing interesting to say some will argue that SW isn't about character development well i don't think so the 3 others movies were somewhat interesting on this subject but the Phantom Menace just don't get it ! One other thing is Anakin at the end of the movie blowing out everything so easily !  Again some will say don't took it too seriously its Star Wars well i think Episode IV V VI were more serious but at same time were appealing to the children but Episode 1 fail on this its too child orienting !  Another things i didn't like is the race, it was cool but i think it was too long... it was also a way for Lucas to sell more video games ...  The first hour of this movie is simply boring and the other hour kick a$$ !  Now i will pass to the more positive aspect of the movie, the final lightsaber combat between Darth Maul and the 2 jedi are simply great and exciting ! Finally i think its a good movie maybe i will see it another time but more than two times i think its fanatism ... well i'm a little fanatic when it came for Star Trek stuff so i understand the Star Wars fans ...",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
The Prequel that Took the World by Storm,"This movie is the most despised prequel in existence. Star Wars the Phantom Menace is certainly a film to behold whether it be for the good or bad qualities it had. With a film that came 22 years after his last directed movie, one can't expect to find a flawless movie but I suppose people couldn't imagine it would be this different from what we saw in the Star Wars Original Trilogy. Anyway, it's time to unravel just why this is a bad Star Wars film, but not necessarily a bad movie. Yeah, this isn't THAT BAD of a film, even with all the screw-ups and failures within. Let's get started, and if you don't wanna continue than just know that I think this movie is watchable even if a disappointing follow up for Star Wars.To be fair, though this movie is terribly flawed it still has a lot of nostalgic value for me. The music and sound design is fantastic, the visuals are very inviting, and it still carries that Star Wars atmosphere. Whenever you see a planet or a spaceship fly by it's an epic experience. This is visual storytelling done very well. BUT that means that we pave way for a lot of dumb crap. Why is it necessary to have dumb lines be said by everybody without any sort of emotion behind them? We get lines like, ""I hope so, yes, I guess."" That is inexcusable! ""Yes, I guess?"" ""YES, I GUESS???"" Are you kidding me?!?! They just pop out at random, though to be fair, when they manage to be bad at least their quotable and hilarious to listen to. But when you realize that this is supposed to be a Star Wars movie.....you get kinda upset!The biggest problem with this film is characters. Seriously, characters? Why is that so difficult? Well because George Lucas decided to rob these characters of emotion so everybody talks the same except for a few characters like Palpatine who have a distinct voice. The British are the only ones who can act when given no direction, all the Americans are just robbed of emotion. The worst case of this is with Jake Lloyd. This boy just had no emotion whatsoever and whenever he spoke in a different manner it sounded awful ""Yippee"" he often screams? ""Yippie?"" Does anybody proofread Lucas' script!The movie itself is of course labelled by the sin to cinema called Jar Jar Binks! Everybody hates him and so do I, but not for the reasons you might expect. Yes the dialect could be called racist but when he speaks normally I actually don't mind him.....I seriously mean that! The problem is that whenever he screams I want to tear my ears out! He screams all the time so thus he's insufferable and his ""comedy"" fails to warrant any intentional laughs. This is jarring, no pun intended, because Star Wars is supposed to have lovable characters.....not this! First of all this movie doesn't need comedic relief, so to insert one in here requires expect writing and Lucas clearly lacks this.Now how can one like this movie. Well, as stated, whenever this film gets bad it's still fun bad! It's just a fun space adventure that can be stupid at times but sometimes you can just forget about it because you're having a good time. The moments that are good, are really good, because there actually is a lot of practical effects used in this movie as well as real landscapes and miniature work! When it's good, it's really good! The light saber battle in this movie is easily one of the best action scenes ever put to cinema! Sometimes a legitimate laugh does come and it's refreshing to hear it at certain moments. Overall this is a fun movie. It may be dumb, but for what it is I can still find enjoyment.As a Star Wars movie this gets a 6/10 but as a fun space adventure 8/10 baby! There is a great movie hiding here and sometimes you can get glimpses of it! The Phantom Menace has problems galore, but when it succeeds it's legitimately fun to watch and revisit from time to time. Check it out and see for yourself.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
the foundation,"it is easy to criticize it. because Jar Jar Binks is strange and embarrassing. because the expectations are high and large. but it is a history from the past. and that purpose remains more important than the details who could be not real seductive. it is the story of Anakin Skywalker and , as first step from his biography, it has coherence and amazing scenes and touching moments. it is the first page from the fairy tale. you know the end. but the beginning is more important and seductive and fragile because it remains the first brick. one of the films who creates its public. and that fact is result of a profound perspective about the entire series. it is not great. only honest trip to the source of a significant cultural piece of the second part of XX century.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
It's not that bad people,"I know that no science fiction can top any of the three original STAR WARS films. The first one was groundbreaking and much like THE GODFATHER PART 2, EMPIRE was better than the original. And JEDI was a little underrated. Trust me, watch the last 30 minutes or so. The last 30 minutes are the ending to a legend. But, TPM wasn't that freaking bad. Really. It's watchable. But, the characters are a little chopped up. Jake Lloyd as Anakin Skywalker makes me vomited. Not really vomited, but there could have been someone better than him. He does add a childlike figure to Darth. You have to remember, this kid is the darkest human being on any film screen. So give it time, let it sink in. It's not that bad.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Quite Entertaining,"I know i will probably get in trouble for thisBut i enjoyed Star wars Episode I The Phantom MenaceThe Movie had great special effects and yes the writing could have been better, but i guess this movie was just trying to introduce all the characters.The Battle Droids and Gungans were cool but out of all the gungans Jar Jar Binks probably got a bit annoying at times. Liam Neeson as Qui-Gon-Jin and Ewan Mcgregor as Obi-Wan-Kenobi were perfect in there roles...in fact Qui-Gon_jin was probably my favourite character in this movie.Darth Maul was also a good character i loved his look, but as a sith he was a bit of a amateur but the double edged light saber look was great.Overall i enjoyed this movie but it had it faults and it could have been better, but it will probably better once the whole series comes together.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Too many kids have grown up,"As a devout fan of the whole Star Wars phenomenon, I become increasingly frustrated with comments on how this new Star Wars doesn't stand up to the originals.  For those who remember the originals, they were just as much filled with bad acting, poor dialogue, and flat characters.  The Star Wars movies are meant to be fun, nothing more.  and The Phantom Menace is just that.  Who can deny the excitement of the light-saber dueling, the thrill of the pod race, or the sheer beauty of the alien locations?  Too many people are expecting the saga's content to have matured along with them, but Lucas' heart is still where it was in 1977 (though perhaps notably more profit-oriented).",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Who needs a 'SW for kids'??,"I'm so sorry folks, I really, really loved the trilogy myself, but you gotta admit it: THIS ONE IS THE WORST!Lucas. You own Star Wars, and you mess it up with your chewing gum commercial kids and cute Jamaican aliens. Ambitionless and decadent, you've forgotten how to direct.Thus, my first (and biggest) disappointment was that the long, grand scenes (like the trilogy's first scene with the Emperor, etc)weren't present. Why they're gone? Because they're expensive, and they take TIME to shoot.IV/V/VI are action for teenagers, and film art as well. Of course, we all saw them first when we were, like, 8 years old, but then it was SO cool to see violent, scary movies made for teens! This doesn't have that magic at all!Jar-Jar: YOUSA SUCK! We all know that Jar-Jar is a CGC. It doesn't look at all real when the Jedis talk to him, and none of his movements are realistic. Why all the BAD CG? Jurassic Park CG is much more convincing!Anakin: Yeah. You're such a cool little kid with NO acting talent. See you in the next ""Home Alone""-movie. The racing scenes were boring in rel to VI's ""forest scooters"".I'VE GOT TO ADMIT:* The Princess ruled bigtime. Grand. Beautiful! Excellent!! * Darth Maul was a nice evil character. I loved the light staff. (And I don't mean the staff at Industrial Light & Magic) * The revelation of the senator as the future emperor. * Having seen VI, I know that Anakin is finally killed. Whew!These few pluses make it worthwhile to wait for II and III.This is a mediocre film. Other SW fans; I know some of you slept outside the cinemas for days, but please, don't pretend that this is a good SW.You're only stomping all over the brilliant three.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Why I hated this film,"I'm not a Star Wars fan and I have not seen the other Star Wars movies. But, I don't need to see them to know that this is one of the worst movies ever made. Jar Jar Binks and Anakin (Jake Lloyd) are the most annoying characters I have ever seen on screen. I will never understand why George Lucas decided to cast Jake Lloyd as Anakin. His acting is awful in this movie. Natalie Portman as Queen Amidala is no better. I won't even mention Jar Jar Binks. We all know how pathetic he was. In short; the plot is lame, the acting is awful, and the effects are OK. The effects alone could not save this film. If you have not seen this poor excuse for a movie, then don't bother renting it. Save your money for coffee or something. Out of 10 I give this movie 1.1/10",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Very entertaining,Don't know why this film doesn't have as good reviews as the first 3 Star Wars film. This film is very entertaining. Many memorable characters. The visual effects and CGI is great.

Wonderful but not perfect beginning of the greatest movie saga of all time.,"""Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace"" was probably one of the most anticipated movie of the last couple of decades. Because of the whole hype around it, it could only disappoint and it was no surprise that lot's of people eventually were disappointed. I have to admit that even I was disappointed a bit. The first time I saw it in the cinema I would had probably rated it a 7/10 but the second time I saw it in the cinema (yes, a real Star Wars fan doesn't watch a Star Wars movie just once in cinema :P), I already began to appreciate it more. It really is a movie that grows onto you. I'm now at the point were I'm loving this movie and see it as a great addition to the Star Wars saga. Granted that it's not the perfect beginning of the series but it certainly is a entertaining and beautiful movie. If this would had been the first Star Wars movie that had been made, I'm sure it would had been received way better than it did now.There are two things in this movie that make me consider this a great movie; The podrace and the duel of the fates. Those two parts in the movie make this is science-fiction classic. Yes, sure the podrace was totally inspired by the ""Ben-Hur"" chariot race scene and therefor it's not the most original sequence in movie history but it has been made with lot's of profession and excellent special effect supported by the John Williams soundtrack. It should get your adrenaline really flowing. And even the biggest Star Wars hater has to admit that the duel of the fates is spectacular. It simply is the best lightsaber fight of all the Star Wars movies so far (Maybe the Obi-Wan/Anakin lightsaber fight is going to be even better?). It mainly is spectacular thanks to Ray Park as Darth Maul. His moves are incredible and something totally different than we were used to from the the other three firstly made Star Wars movies.Then why is ""Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace"" not a perfect movie? Well, there are several problems. One is the at times weak dialog. The other is of course the character Jar Jar Binks but maybe the biggest problem is Jake Lloyd as the young Anakin Skywalker. He plays very inconsistent. In the one scene he is perfect and in the other he is just simply awful. Some words of comfort for Jake; he is not the worst actor in this movie. Ralph Brown is even more horrible as Ric Olié AKA Captain Obvious but also Pernilla August was pretty awful at times. Thankfully the rest of the cast is casted very well and there are some wonderful newly added characters. There have always been lot's of critic on the casting of the new Star Wars movies but I don't think that always has been completely fair. After all the movie has several Academy Award nominees (Samuel L. Jackson, Natalie Portman, Liam Neeson, Terence Stamp) and it should get credit for casting Keira Knightley who hardly had been in any movies before appearing in this movie, in a fairly large role. Keira Knightley now is one of the biggest and fastest rising Hollywood stars of this decade. It also is great to see that some of the actors from the first made Star Wars movies are back to star in this movie (Frank Oz, Anthony Daniels, Kenny Baker, Ian McDiarmid). There also are some new great characters like Watto, Sebulba and the previously mentioned Darth Maul with his cool make-up and moves.The movie is very good non-stop entertainment in a good quick pace and come to think of it, it might very well the most entertaining Star Wars movie of them all. The special effects and make-up and costumes are top-class (even though Yoda looks horrible) and the icing on the cake is the musical score from John Williams. The movie is mainly fun and it has some spectacular moments. Also the lightsaber fight/droid battle/space fight ending will not disappoint you even though the space fight is the worst of all the Star Wars movies. But I think that says more about the other Star Wars movies than about this movie. Actually the fact that most people were disappointed with this movie says more about the other Star Wars movies than about this one, for this really is a great highly entertaining, nearly perfect movie for the entire family.9/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"A Mess, But A Spectacular One","Next to the special editions, the Star Wars prequels are perhaps the most hated part of the saga. In a way, it makes sense as to why. Each of the three films, released between 1999 and 2005, are filled with their share of issues, ranging from corny dialogue, stilted acting, over-reliance on CGI, and inconsistencies and plot holes when compared to the original trilogy. Many people hate the Star Wars prequels, but I must say that I am not one of them. In fact, I enjoy the prequels for what they are, and even though they aren't perfect, they still work in the overall story of the series as a whole.Having said that, it's no secret that The Phantom Menace, the first Star Wars film in the prequel trilogy and the start of the story chronologically, is a mess of a movie. From a story standpoint, it tries very hard to incorporate so much, jumping from one planet to another, having so many different characters and plot threads all going on at once. Granted, I understand why: this film not only has to be the start to a trilogy, but also the series as a whole. However, it's clear that after not directing or writing a film since the 1970s, George Lucas struggled to get the story together in a consistent and fluent way.This does not mean, however, that The Phantom Menace is without its positive moments. The visual effects still look pretty incredible almost twenty years later. The action sequences are exciting and the lightsaber battles, particularly the final three-way battle between Obi-Wan, Qui-Gon, and Darth Maul, are well choreographed. They definitely make the movie watchable throughout the 130 minute runtime. However, the weak script is really what bogs this story down. The dialogue is atrocious in this movie, and there are so many lines that are achingly bad. Even the acting can be pretty stilted at time, delivered as if they are reading their lines from a cue card.That said, there are some decent performances in the film as well. Liam Neeson gives a spectacular performance as Qui-Gon Jinn, Obi- Wan's master. He was able to keep my attention anytime he was on screen, and was able to get through most of the film's dialogue without any problems. Ewan McGregor also shines as young Obi-Wan. Though he has a line or two that is pretty corny, he does a fine job in the role and continues to get better as the movies go along. Ian McDairmid reprises his role as Palpatine, a senator in this movie, and works very well in his brief but important role in the story.Sadly, many of the other performances and/or characters aren't as good. I know it has been said many times, but Jar Jar Binks is an annoying character. When I first saw this movie, I didn't mind him as much, but in recent years I've come to understand why there is so much hate towards him. He's a bumbling idiot that almost adds nothing to the story except in the final battle. And as much I hate to put Jake Lloyd down as he was only a kid when the film came out, he wasn't that great as little Anakin Skywalker.I know it sounds like I'm bagging on this movie for its flaws, but that is only because they truly hinder what could be a great film. The concept behind the prequels and their overall story is not bad; in fact, this movie does what it was setting out to do: create a beginning for the series that would set up not only what happens in the rest of the trilogy but in the entire saga as a whole. It just didn't do it as well as it could have. That being said, the reason why I don't give it any lower than a 6/10 is because I can still watch this movie, flaws and all, and still get enjoyment out of it. I still love the visual effects. I still love the action sequences. I still think that it has a lot of great moments sprinkled throughout the film. That is why I don't think that this is a bad film, but rather a film that is both spectacular and messy all at the same time.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

your just a critic,"sorry to say, but you are merely a critic and not a film maker. Do you realiZe how DIFFICULT and long it takes to make a film? Every key aspect must be taken into consideration, problems solved, and with a bit of improv it comes out great. I love the movie base it was non-stop action, special effects were amazing, and the music was fantastic. EX: duel of fates. You are just a critic and not a famous filmmaker. Instead of criticizing a film, maybe you should actually watch it and be entertained for just a little second. The problem with you critics is that your never in the spot light and judge films based on the amount of money coming your way. For example, critics said BIG FAT LIAR was the best comedy of the year, funnier than RAT RACE, and absolutely amazing.....it was terrible.Sorry i forgot, what is your name?

For every Star Wars fan,"I'm a huge Star Wars fan so I can watch the movie and enjoy it any day of the week, however There's a mix of good and bad in this movie. It kinda took to far of a dive into trying to make this movie for children . At times it feels like this movie was made by Disney instead of lucasfilm .The two worst parts of the movie is undoubtedly any scene jar jar binks is in , and the cringe worthy line from a young 10 year old anakin skywalker who has never flown before ""I'll try spinning that's a good trick "" he goes from never flying to blowing up a separatist ship , while teaching himself to fly in the process .I mean I know it's Star Wars but it still feels to unbelievable for even a galaxy far far away . The best part of the movie in my opinion is darth maul, and being able to get a chance to get a look at obi wans mentor Qui-Gon Jinn (Liam Neeson). Darth maul leaves such an impression he barley has any dialogue but you can just sense hes someone you don't want to cross paths with , and he proves it in the end of the movie by taking on obi and Qui-Gon in one of the best Star Wars light saber battles in my opinion .I hope this review helped and I just want to state that by no means do I think it's a bad movie , I don't think any Star Wars movie is bad , but if your not a Star Wars fan it's very possible your not gonna like it.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"It's Good, but not really that very good or a masterpiece.","The film was pretty good but it's not that great compared to the others Star Wars movies, which makes it an OK Star Wars film, not a pretty good one.I didn't mind Jar Jar Binks or some other aspects of the film, but I wish there were more soundtracks in the race of speeders, talking on the soundtracks, its Star Wars, all the soundtracks were really great as always.I think the movie was a bit prolonged and the final battle, although good, wasn't that long or epic, but for me, it was good and has its importance, I think the actors did well and that's not a bad start to tell the story of Star Wars.But I believe that a large part of the public's disgust came because of the hype that was generated in the film, Star Wars 16 years later and everyone expected something epic and unforgettable like the original trilogy, unfortunately it wasn't like that, but it's definitely not a bad film or the worst Star Wars film, I recommend it to Star Wars fans and for anyone interested in starting to watch the series, this is my review.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
It was like Christmas in May,"When I woke up in the morning of May 19, I sensed something--something I hadn't felt since...1983.  It was a day millions of fans have been waiting many years for.  We will also gladly and impatiently continue to wait for II and III.Finally we get a chance to see the making of the saga.  I was nervous as my friends and I waited in line at the movie theater, and checked my pocket numerous times for my pre-purchased ticket.  I was anxious when the music started, and the words 'Episode 1: The Phantom Menace' scrolled up the screen.  I was also beginning to realize how much water and coffee I had drank that morning.  And as I approached a 'nervous breakdown' state, frantically began to calculate the time it would take me to run to the bathroom and back.Forget about any of the reviews or rumors you've heard.  Overlook the fact that the media says the movie is over-hyped, even though they over-hyped it. This movie is fantastic--for it's plot and visual effects.  If you recall, 'A New Hope' was a very basic (yet fascinating) film plot with great effects.  What made the saga what it is today was the overwhelming detail and intricate universe that surrounds the characters.  It wasn't until 'Empire' that we get thrown into the massive underlying story of the trilogy.  The same will hold true here, as we will all be witness to the creation of modern mythology.I dare the critics who gave this movie a bad review to take another look and read between the lines of this so called 'thin' plot.  The movie already shows structure similar to Star Wars.  Lucas didn't fail in telling a mesmerizing story.  Instead he has built the framework for another trilogy that will end up shocking and amazing you--as did the originals.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

horrible,"Couldn't stand it. This is filmmaking at its very worse. Lucas is a very one-dimensional writer/director. It worked for the first couple of films. Not really science fiction, just action with a lot of cool gadgets and a basic good vs.evil plot.This was terrible. I gave up after the first 20 minutes. My intelligence was insulted. I had no interest in the characters, or the story. A trade war? Huh? and the special effects were nauseating. Why hire all those expensive actors? Just animate the humans too.Doesn't matter how lame it is, these star wars fans will go see it anyway and give it 10 stars on the IMDb. If you take away the 10s, this movie would average about a 5.

"Crisply written, fast paced, excellent!","What do you expect from a bunch of people who build something up in their minds so much that they're willing to camp out in silly costumes for days, just to be among the first to see it?  Of course they don't like it.  It couldn't even come close to surpassing their expectations.  They cheered when it started and the ""STAR WARS"" title hit the screen with full brass. They were too excited and want too much.Nonetheless, this is a great film.  It is highly entertaining, and a very nice example of how the best writers and directors and musicians and actors and supporters in the world can turn a large budget into a large film. It's huge.  The story is much bigger than most films, a delight for those viewers who like to unravel complex story lines.  The effects are magnificent, and as of this writing 3 years after the movie was made, I have still yet to see any film that approaches this one's visual effects (there are almost zero special effects, but that just underlines how good the visual effects must be).

Flawed and incredibly interesting.,"Hello, kid who grew up with the prequels here.I think it's fair to open with such a sentence, as there's been a lot of looking back on these films after the sequel trilogy disappointed too many people. I actually didn't realise that it had been ten years since I last watched any of the prequel films. Like Harry Potter, or Lord of the Rings, they're so ingrained into my memory that the need to rewatch doesn't come up as often as it should.Rose-tinted glasses are used quite often when looking at these films, and under scrutiny the presentation doesn't hold up nearly as well as the iconic originals. They're absolutely flawed (especially the first two); messy, clunky, and lacking in execution. The dialogue is not befitting the budget, the pacing is bizarre and the film seemingly can't decide whether or not its for adults or kids, despite Lucas stating it's definitely the latter. Having said all that, I can't help but like it.Sure, nostalgia plays a big part. But I think having some distance from Star Wars and now just recently falling in love with it all over again has made me appreciate the legacy of this trilogy. Phantom Menace is a technical achievement that does so much for the universe of Star Wars. The worldbuilding on display here is simply awesome, and its no wonder that so many high quality games, books and tv shows have used the foundation this film and its two direct sequels created. Naboo and Coruscant are beautiful, and Tatooine looks better than ever before. The character, ship and planet designs and ideas are particularly inspired. What's important is that the trilogy rarely rehashes from the originals and develops its own aesthetic which isn't antithetical to what came before (or after, in universe).I admire George Lucas for his ideas, the man is important to cinema and is certainly to be lauded in many fields. But, he shouldn't have directed. He should have had his vision filtered through a more competent screenwriter.What's rough about rewatching this trilogy every time is the potential of the story. I think the story is brilliant. Anakin Skywalker's arc is one of my favourites in fiction. The Revenge of the Sith novelisation shows the potential of this epic story realised with amazing writing.It's odd that the Tatooine section pertaining to Anakin feels kind of out of place. Like a big, awkward chunk shoved in between parts of a more interesting part of the story. That more interesting part (the conflict surrounding the Trade Federation blockade of Naboo) also comes off as being more for adults than kids. It's a weird feeling, finding that the parts I enjoyed as a kid (pod racing, Gungan battle, half of Jar Jars antics) I now find to be tedious, and the parts I didn't like so much (blockade, Coruscant politics, Palpatine) I now really love. A lot of the latter did go over my head as a kid. Maybe I was dumb, but I do think the film is quite packed with information.There isn't many scenes that my enjoyment has stayed the same for. The Maul scene towards the end is iconic of course, and now realising the long-lasting stakes of the showdown really highlighted George's skill at storytelling (Duel of the Fates is such an apt title for the soundtrack).Overall though it's just a weird balance for kids and adults. The original trilogy managed to be childishly entertaining even in its more serious moments. I get that George made Star Wars for kids, and that's fantastic. But if this is the idea, he failed executing it with how prevalent trade politics are, and how ridiculous Jar Jar is. I can say this, because I've seen it both as a kid and an adult.Jar Jar has infamously been lambasted by hundreds of thousands of fans. Personally, I think the actor absolutely did a fantastic job. Unfortunately I never really liked the character as a kid, and find it tiresome now. Still, the technology is at least fun to see. For 1999 it blows everything else that year out of the water.In terms of story potential in this entry, I do wish we had only seen a snippet of Anakin as a kid, with a time skip to the build up of the Clone Wars in this film. Having seen the animated series (which has some of the best moments in Star Wars and improves the prequels dramatically), parts of that in live-action would have done wonders for the story, and understanding his mental state in the final moments before... well, you know.I do appreciate that instead, this film is building up Palpatine, but I honestly think that it's too disconnected (at this point in the story) from the emotional core that is Anakin.Before I conclude, I have to say that the prequel soundtracks are some of the best of all time, and are better than the original for me. It's my favourite work from John Williams, who already has a ridiculous track record. Duel of the Fates is amazing of course, but the best tracks probably come from the next two films. Both of which I'll highlight my favourite pieces when I get to reviewing them.So I'm left feeling conflicted. I enjoy watching the film, but there's always the feeling that it could have been so much better. The story is awesome. The characters are iconic. If the writing was better, if the characters spoke like normal people, and the timeline was changed round a bit, I would probably enjoy the prequels more than the original trilogy.I am very curious to see the reputation of the sequel trilogy twenty years later. Will they be looked back upon as fondly as the prequels? I don't know how connected kids at the time of release were with that section of the story. So far there hasn't been many games connected to that era, whereas the prequels had so many excellent ones. Battlefront II was a massive time-sink for me and my brother.And at least the prequels went out with a bang. There is a purpose for a lot of what's here, and especially so for most of the second film. It's all walking so Revenge of the Sith can fly.

Sky-High Expectations From The Masses Pretty Much Killed This Very Good Film...,"It was in the first half of 1999. The whole world is excited about the long awaited prequel to the Star Wars saga, 3 landmark films. Everyone's expectations were huge. Everyone who knew about this movie was expecting something of a perfect film. No film could ever meet that expectation. Ever.Finally, the film comes out. Much to everyone's surprise, anyone who wasn't a star wars fan said it was horrible. ""Star Wars has lost its force"" said one film reviewer. More and more people said the film was a let down. Some people just didnt see the film because of what other people said.So, when I finally see the film, after having heard all of the put downs for the film, my expectations weren't very high. I was expecting a B-grade movie with nice action scenes. When the film was over, though, I was pleasantly suprised. It was actually a pretty good movie. I believe the reason that people said the movie was a let down was because the Star Wars franchise was bordering on legendary - something that could not be matched. People kept expecting the movie to top its predecessor, and by doing that, when the movie didn't, they unfairly judged the movie.Now, during the movie, if you look past the Star Wars franchise, the movie is a Very good Stand Alone Title. The film has flaws, though.  Some of the acting is sub-par, especially Anakin's friends.Jar Jar Binks can also be very annoying, and the movie relies too heavily on special effects.But even with these flaws, Phantom Menace is a good movie, but I would not recommend buying it, unless you are a Star Wars fan. Watch it in the theatre then rent the DVD with special features. You will not be let down.So, all in all, Phantom Menace was killed because the expectations were way too high. But, if you can give the film a chance as a stand-alone, you will probably like it.8.0/10",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
A unique look at the series but quite flawed...,"Enter Star Wars.Beginning of the most successful Science Fiction epic of all time.Brilliant in so many ways.Enter Empire Strikes Back.Consumes the first with immense professionalism and a brilliant final sequence.Enter Return of the Jedi.A dark take at the emotions of Luke and a finale that leaves you breathless.Now comes The Phantom Menace...It starts off, ""whodathunkit"" in space. With a ship approaching the Trade Federation ship that is blocking off all entry into Naboo. The first person to speak is an unnamed (irrelevant character altogether) female captain with an unnecessarily high (and very annoying) voice who thankfully DIES ten minutes later, then we get a glimpse of the shady Viceroy, a ""lazy"" villain who starts off the long string of ethnic mockery with his horribly obvious Japanese accent.This is a movie that had so much potential, the cast was brilliant (save for Jake Lloyd...); the animation was up to date; and you know the story just clicks with the original trilogy the moment you hear the name ""Obi-Wan"" leave Qui Gon Jinn's (Liam Neeson, Schindler's List) mouth and you see him standing there, Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor, Trainspotting) in all his youth.But what it really has not got going for it was the horrible actor playing Anakin; the intensely frequent, blatant and aggravating ethnic accent mockery; and the Gungans... yes, the latter alone was a catastrophe, easily the stupidest things created by Mr. Lucas and to make Jar Jar Binks sound like a Jamaican- wannabe has just crossed the line...The dialogue is pretty horrible too, ""Roger-roger""; ""They'll squash us, cut us into tiny little pieces, and then blast us into oblivion!""; and the ever annoying ""Mesa Gungan!"".However these can be overlooked by some (not by many...) with its spectacular Pod Race scene, which takes up a good slice of the movie; and the brilliant lightsaber finale, which seemed to have sparked up a short-lasting craze for the Double-Edged Lightsaber in which you see the main villain Darth Maul (Ray Park) wield in the fight scene where sparks fly and a unique obstruction twist leads to ultra drama.I certainly enjoyed it, I can't guarantee you will, though if you can look past the flaws, move on to the slightly less flawed Episode II and get your blood pumping for Episode III, then you'll love the Star Wars series more than you did before.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

The Saga Begins With Polarizing Reactions,"Star Wars fans love to argue about the series, especially on the Internet. The origin of such toxicity in the fandom could be traced back to 1999, when George Lucas released ""Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace,"" the first Star Wars feature to hit theaters since ""Return of the Jedi"" wrapped up the original trilogy in 1983.""Episode I"" takes place thirty-two years before the events of the original Star Wars. It is the first installment in Lucas' prequel trilogy, which focuses on Anakin Skywalker's transformation into Darth Vader and the Empire's rise over the Galactic Republic.On paper, this story sounds deeply enticing, and many Star Wars fans thought so when Lucasfilm first announced the movie. In fact, even after the movie came out, fans and critics initially met ""The Phantom Menace"" with praise. Only over the years has it become so divisive.Narratively, ""Episode I"" finds Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jin (Liam Neeson) and his apprentice, a young Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor), running a diplomatic missions during a relatively peaceful time in the galaxy. When things go awry, though, the Jedi must rescue Queen Amidala (Keira Knightly/Natalie Portman) from her invaded home planet of Naboo and take her to the galaxy's political capitol on Coruscant.Along the way, the ship endures damages and they must stop on the familiar desert planet of Tatooine for repairs. Here Qui-Gon meets Anakin Skywalker (Jake Loyd), a nine-year-old slave boy. Convinced that Anakin is ""The Chosen One"" meant to bring balance to the Force, Qui-Gon frees Anakin and takes him with them.All the while, a sinister threat brews beneath the surface. The Sith - a group of Force-wielders from the Dark Side - plan something malicious and mysterious. A hooded figure named Lord Sidious (Ian McDiarmid) and his apprentice Darth Maul (Ray Park) helm a plot to destroy the Jedi and have their ""revenge.""In case you still haven't seen the film, I will leave the plot description at that. Story-wise, ""The Phantom Menace"" is relatively strong. George Lucas surely could have benefitted from a more critical team to edit his screenplay, but as the sole writer, director, and executive producer, there was bound to be an absence of perspectives during development.As opposed to the other prequels, though, ""Episode I"" at least feels intimate. Much like the original Star Wars movies, it narrows in on a small band of characters within the vast universe.Of course, I understand the complaints about the narrative as well. ""Episode I"" lacks a direct main character and has more than a few plot holes. Anakin Skywalker doesn't show up until thirty minutes into the film, and then, he hardly shares any lines with Obi-Wan. The dynamic between these two characters, to which the original trilogy alluded heavily, should have been this film's obvious focus, but instead, it's hardly an afterthought.Meanwhile, the choice to make Anakin nine-years-old is questionable. If Anakin was a bit older, then he would feel more rounded and relatable. Lucas will claim that Star Wars is for kids, but even watching this film as a child, I never had much interest in young Anakin. Also, not to fixate on what came after ""The Phantom Menace,"" but if Anakin entered the saga as a teenager rather than a boy, then the gap between ""Episode I"" and ""II"" would not be so extreme. We'd be able to follow him as the prequel's clear protagonist and his infamous romance with Natalie Portman's Padme (who is ~5 years Anakin's senior in this film) would not feel as creepy in the subsequent movies.Young Anakin aside, I also understand fans' disappointment that ""The Phantom Menace"" dose not take place during the Clone Wars. In the Star Wars mythos, the Clone Wars is the logical chapter to center the prequels around, as the original trilogy frequently references it as the major conflict preceding the Empire. Nevertheless, I simultaneously value ""Episode I"" as a rare glimpse into a less war-wrought time in the mythology. Overall, the Galactic Republic setting gives this film a very unique flavor in the series.Furthermore, ""The Phantom Menace"" is also an aesthetically polarizing film. Despite being a breakthrough film for CGI, much of the visual effects do not hold up today. Then again, few computerized images from the nineties have stood the test of time. Even rewatching ""The Matrix"" or ""Terminator 2,"" we can now see the digital strings. Seeing them in Star Wars just hits a little harder because the original trilogy has such timeless special effects.That being said, I do appreciate that ""The Phantom Menace"" still integrates some practical effects. Lucas returned to Tunisia to film the Tatooine sequences on-location, and for the Naboo and Pod-Racing scenes, he used some wonderful miniatures to create the illusion of grandiose sets. The subsequent prequels, by contrast, mostly threw away practical effects altogether for fully virtual environments, thus losing a touch of the Star Wars cinematic magic.On the topic of CGI, we must address Jar-Jar Binks, the fully animated character voiced by Ahmed Best. Jar-Jar is a Gungan, a lizard-like creature from Naboo's underwater depths. Like everything else animated into the film, Jar-Jar's appearance has aged dubiously. However, his characterization has outlived his aesthetic... and not for the better.Jar-Jar is ""The Phantom Menace's"" comic relief character, but while the original Star Wars movies achieved comedy through witty dialogue and the cool effortlessness of Harrison Ford, Jar-Jar's main strategy is slapstick paired with goofy voices and the occasional poop joke. He is one of the most hated aspects of ""The Phantom Menace,"" and while I will not outright defend him, I will say that Star Wars zealots give Jar-Jar far too much attention. He is but a side character. If ""Episode I"" had fixed some of its larger flaws, we'd likely forgive Jar-Jar and maybe even appreciate him as a technological precursor to The Lord of the Rings' Gollum or ""Avatar's"" Na'vi.Now that we've covered Jar-Jar, lets look at a couple undisputed positive parts of ""The Phantom Menace.""Darth Maul is one of the coolest characters the saga has to offer. While he might be underused in the series as a whole, he serves as an awesome antagonist in this film. Red-faced, horned, and sporting face tattoos as black has his robes, Maul looks devilishly intimidating. He only says a few lines throughout the entire movie, but he speaks more than eloquently through his nonchalantly menacing actions, especially when those actions involve his double-sided red lightsaber - a brilliant new take on the classic weapon.Like any good Star Wars movie, ""The Phantom Menace"" climaxes with a good vs evil lightsaber duel. This time it's two against one, as Obi-Wan and Qui-Gon team up against Maul. Despite all criticisms about ""Episode I,"" the scene holds up as one of the best duels in the entire saga. That impressive accolade is in no small part thanks to John William's epic ""Duel Of The Fates"" score.John Williams returns for ""Episode I's"" entire soundtrack and it is one of the few elements of the film that fans and critics consistently praise across the board. Every movement is exceptional and ""Duel Of The Fates"" in particular is one of the most cherished pieces of music in all of Star Wars - perhaps in movies as a whole.Lastly, ""The Phantom Menace"" effectively expands the Star Wars universe, introducing audiences to new creatures, planets, timelines, and systems. Some might complain that Lucas only expands this universe through the dry medium of galactic politics, but given that the trilogy aims to show the rise of an Empire, politics are somewhat unavoidable. Also, in the background of those politics, ""Episode I"" gives us the beautiful landscapes of Naboo, the ultramodern urban planet of Courasant, and dozens of exotic aliens (both real and CGI) that all remind us that we're back in a vast galaxy far, far away.As I said at the beginning of this review, Star Wars fans love to argue on the Internet, and they especially love to rant about ""The Phantom Menace."" By nature of posting this article, I suppose I have joined such ranks, but I hope to have approached the film from a fair angle.In the end, I stand by that ""Episode I"" has a lot to admire. Growing up in the 2000s, the movie was as much a part of my childhood as the original films. With time, I have come to understand the criticisms, but I simultaneously can't shake a massive amount of enjoyment every time I return to it. Maybe that is nostalgia rendering me bias. However, in recent years, there has been a noticeable surge in prequel adoration amongst the Star Wars community. This could be a new generation of fans taking the reins of criticism, or it could be a backlash to all of the excessive negativity surrounding the films. Either way, ""The Phantom Menace"" is making a comeback, and a well deserved one for all of the unreasonable hate it's received over the years.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Do metachlorines cause bad acting?,"The first time I saw this film I was impressed.  Sure Jar Jar was annoying but the action was enough to keep me interested and I was anxious to find out how the Empire would be formed.  After watching it a second time, knowing the action that would take place, I listened carefully to the dialogue.  Again, Jar Jar's mangled English was of course annoying.  The new thing I really noticed was that none of the characters seemed to really know what they were doing in the movie.  The dialogue was awful and the hinted ""relationship"" between Anakin and his babysitter at the end was sick and wrong.Natalie Portman was a disappointing Queen Amidala as Lucas' misguided attempts at multiculturalism transformed her into some Japanese princess whose personality was so wooden, it made Al Gore look like Ronald Reagan. If Lucas was trying for a new Princess Leia, he found the wrong actress. Leia in the original Star Wars delivers her lines with wit and spark. Amidala delivers her lines in an utterly boring and unconvincing monotone.Jake Lloyd is the worst actor of the bunch, however as cute little Anakin Skywalker (affectionately called Anny by everyone).  Do metachlorines cause bad acting?  That may explain why young ""Anny"" treats the scene where he is leaving his mother behind like he is going out on a campout  (Gee mom, can I go?)  That would also explain why young Anakin expresses his ""love"" for Amidala at the end....""Space is cold.  I care for you alot.   I guess.   Can I have some ice cream?....(if that doesn't make you gag, nothing will). Maybe the fear Yoda sensed in Anakin was the fear that after this he'll never get another acting job again.Possible deleted scene on the DVD release:Amidala:  Stop that.Anakin: Stop what?Amidala:  My hands are dirty.Anakin:  My hands are dirty too.  We've been finger painting all day, remember?Amidala:  I happen to like nice men.Anakin:  I know I am a bad boy.  You need more bad boys in your life.Amidala:  Kiss me!Anakin:  Okay but will you read me a bedtime story afterwards?  You are the greatest babysitter/girlfriend ever!It must be the metachlorines.

One of the best films of '99,"For a start, what did everyone expect of this film. Brand new and ground breaking special effects? A totally new idea? Come on! What can anyone think of (special effects wise) that hasn't been done before? The original Star Wars films are excellent but half the magic of those films were the special effects being so ground breaking for that time. Nowadays you can make entire films using computers (toy story, a bugs life, antz), you can make the white house explode without a single person saying ""That didn't look realistic"". It looked so real that you couldn't have done a better job if you'd used the real thing.Everyone who watched Star wars in the first place were about 20 years younger than they are now. Your tastes when it comes to films are going to be different. I am 18. I didn't understand the story of star wars properly until I was about 16 because I'd never watched the films before in the right order. I am only a little older from watching and enjoying the original films so I had the same interests when it came to watching Star Wars Episode I.The hype did the film no good at all. People who didn't like star wars in the first place went to watch the film and of course the majority wouldn't like it now. Lucas was always going to be restricted in the story for the first film as it HAS to set the ball rolling. He had to include this and he had to include that. Before he knew what was going on the story had already written itself without him having to think about it.The film is superb, the special effects are stunning. I like the battle scenes, the fighting scenes between the Jedi and Darth Maul and the Pod Race was a must see. The acting was excellent, especially by McGregor. There wasn't much to the plot I agree but thats because like I said before, the film has to set the ball rolling. As for Jar Jar I thought he was a nessesary character, and a good one at that. His voice may be anoying at times but the more you watch the film the more you understand him and the more you like him. If you hav'nt watched this film WATCH IT but put all the hype behind you.

The background is supposed to be in the background (out of focus) so it doesn't detract from what is going on. Also there is a certain amount of charm in having a guy in a suit rather than a completely computer generated being.Also I am annoyed that Natalie Portman was made to redub her lines because it definitely shows at some points.  And they must have had her do some of the dubbing in a city street it was so garbled.Also the alien races were crude racial stereotypes.

Decent Opening to the Prequel-Trilogy.,"Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace is a visually impressive journey back to the beloved galaxy far, far away. The film delivers captivating action sequences, especially the podrace scene, which is a technical feat. It introduces iconic characters like Qui-Gon Jinn and Darth Maul.However, the film suffers from a slow pace and unnecessary political intrigue. Jar Jar Binks could be annoying for me at times, and his comedic elements feel out of tune with the rest of the film's tone.The performances are generally good, especially by Liam Neeson and Ewan McGregor, but some of the dialogues feel stiff and awkward.As always, John Williams' music is outstanding and adds an extra layer of epic feeling to the film.Although The Phantom Menace doesn't reach the heights of the original trilogy, it's still an entertaining movie that has its place in the Star Wars universe. It's worth watching for its fantastic visual effects and the introduction of new iconic characters.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Not That Bad....,"Note: this review was done while watching the 2019 Disney+ release of the film. I'm not an expert on ""Star Wars"" versions, but I believe this is just the 2011 Blu-ray version of ""The Phantom Menace"", which was also the basis for the 2012 3D theatrical re-release. The only noticeable change to me is that Yoda (Frank Oz) has been changed from a puppet in the original theatrical version to being fully computer animated. I personally prefer this version, as this changes the movie to be more in line with the other two prequel trilogy films.""Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace"" has gone down as one of the most picked apart movies by the internet community. Much has been said about the plot line, the pacing, the tone, the dialogue, and the character of Jar Jar Binks (Ahmed Best). The movie definitely has major flaws, and is by no means a ""misunderstood masterpiece"" or anything like that. The quality of the prequel trilogy films still falls flat when compared to that of the original trilogy, but I still believe that there is a ton of enjoyment to be had out of them. They're not without merit. And as far as the prequel trilogy goes, I personally like ""The Phantom Menace"" the best. It's most in line with the original films in terms of tone and story structure, and I think most of the complaints about over-reliance on computer generated special effects should be aimed at the latter two movies of the trilogy.""The Phantom Menace"" starts with Jedi ambassadors Qui-Gon Jinn (Liam Neeson) and Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) traveling to the peaceful planet of Naboo, where the Trade Federation has set up a blockade around the planet due to taxation disputes. After the negotiations fail, the two Jedi Knights rescue Queen Amidala (Natalie Portman) and pick up the clumsy Jar Jar along the way, and they make their way to the desert planet Tatooine, where they are forced to land after their ship is damaged. While on Tatooine, Qui-Gon meets Anakin Skywalker (Jake Lloyd), a slave boy who has an unusually strong connection to the force. Anakin wins his freedom and some much needed repair parts for Qui-Gon's ship in a pod race, and the group then makes their way to Coruscant, the capital planet of the Republic. The Jedi Council is reluctant to take up Anakin in training, and Senator Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid) is using the Naboo crisis as a launchpad to becoming the Supreme Chancellor of the Republic.The pacing of the movie is honestly the biggest detriment. There is a lot of filler, and the plot is not nearly as fast and free-flowing as any of the original trilogy films. A lot has been said about the ""boring space politics"" in this movie, but I honestly don't think that that's a problem, I find the government of ""Star Wars"" to be kind of interesting, and I wish that this movie would have included more of Palpatine scheming and doing back-handed political bargaining. I also don't even mind Jar Jar that much, aside from one or two instances where his high-pitched screaming and goofiness got to be a little too much. The problem is the juxtaposition; the fact that there are so many different emotions conveyed within such a short period of time. There will be serious heart-felt moments and then all of the sudden something funny for the kids to stay engaged. It feels like this movie's script would have benefitted from some cleaning up and shaving off the rough edges. The finale is also very cluttered, with four different battles going on at the same time, some much more important and interesting than the others.Some people have written off this movie completely, as it takes places an entire decade before the other prequel films. They say that it serves no purpose and that you can just skip ""The Phantom Menace"" and move straight on to ""Attack of the Clones."" But I don't think that that's really a good idea. I kind of like that we are shown Anakin being taken from his home at such a young age, and I like seeing Obi-Wan as a hot-headed Jedi apprentice who is reluctantly thrusted into training Anakin.""The Phantom Menace"" is worth a watch for any fan of the original ""Star Wars"" movies. I think that a lot of the criticism is justified, but there is a tendency to needlessly hate on every single thing from the prequel movies. The actors give fine performances, and the score by John Williams is phenomenal, as always. I think one should watch the original trilogy first though. George Lucas intended for the movies to be watched in episodic story order, but I think this is a bad idea, mainly because ""The Phantom Menace"" and the other prequels will already expect you to have some amount of familiarity with the ""Star Wars"" universe, and I also believe that watching the films in this order devalues some of the revelations and plot twists that theater-goers experienced when both of these trilogies were released.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

"Not heartwarming, but fun","Episode 1 is a good film, but it is by no means the best of the series.

And 2- It's not as heart warming as the last ones, the other films seemed to at least have a good sense of love in it.Yet, that doesn't stop writer/director George Lucas form having plenty of fun (including with spectacular visual effects that make up most of the movie) including a terrific Pod Race sequence, great fight scenes, and cool battle action.

Good entertainment anyway.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Poorly Directed,"I hesitate to say anything bad at all about the latest Star Wars flick. But ...Star Wars Episode 1 is a disappointment. And I'm a fan of Sci Fi movies and of the original three films, even if they do look dated these days.George Lucas the writer/director of the Star Wars series describes them as a ""Saturday afternoon serial for children"" and this description is particularly apt for this episode. If you're over 10 years old don't expect too much.After all it wasn't the special effects but the characters who made the original three films entertaining. They had larrikins we cared about, and there was a good dollop of sexual tension. Would Hans Solo and Princess Leila get it together? And where did Skywalker fit in.Hans Solo and the Wookie were rascals with good hearts. R2D2 and C3PO were funny. There was an epic feel to the story, and then there was that mysterious business with The Force.Darth Vader was awesome and we were surprised when we found out who he was. All of these elements made the first three films fun, majestic and mysterious. That rush into The Death Star was tension filled and when Skywalker closed his eyes and ""Trusted The Force"" we had to believe in The Force as well. It worked.So what have we got in The Phantom Menace. No larrikins at all. No Harrison Ford character. It's never funny but remains serious or even worse, seriously unfunny throughout. The robot sidekicks have basically been replaced with and annoying, non understandable no brainer called Jar Jar Binks. Who cares if he's completely digital. He's not entertaining.Darth Vader has been replaced by Darth Maul (Ray Park who's apparently a martial arts star) but there's no sign at all of the majesty and terror that pervaded Darth Vader. Where was that swishing black cape and breathy, sinister voice!And who knows whether Ray Park can act. Darth Maul like the rest of the cast give performances that have the look of second grade amateur theatrics.This is the film's greatest problem. Perhaps the wooden performances that are universal in this film are due to the actors having to perform so often to blue screens to which were later added digital characters. But we would have to suspect that George Lucas really wasn't interested in his actors.He hasn't directed a film for 22 years since Star Wars 3. He has instead done lots of wonderful work on digital effects with his company ILM, exhibiting state of the art wonders in films like Jurassic Park, but his preoccupation hasn't been with flesh and blood actors. Lead Liam Neeson, undoubtedly a first class actor, has been quoted as saying that he won't do another film and will retreat to the stage after his experience on Lucas's film.The Phantom Menace is an outstanding special effects film but it lacks human interest. There has been a phenomenal amount of marketing hype associated with the movie but I wonder how successful the box office figures will be, especially for the next two in the series, if they are as stiff, dry and humourless as this one.George, hire a director for the next two!",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

The direction on a macroscale is great as he uses his experience and creative mind to provide backstory into this galaxy far-far away, and the grand scenes (climax, lightsaber duels, and Podracing) are some of the best in the franchise; the direction on a microscale is very bad as he does not know how to direct actors or get natural feelings out of them; the storytelling is great as he shows why he is the master of storytelling by crafting a backstory to this timeless franchise; he builds tension well in the action/fight scenesStory: Incredible
The concept is great as it provides the backstory for the original trilogy and sets up the character arc of Anakin Skywalker (while having very unique Prequel moments like Podracing and the Battle of Naboo); the plot structure is laid out well as Lucas shows why he is the master of story building; character writing is great as you see how all these characters fall into place for the Anakin to be the chosen one (building connections that will eventually impact him in next movies)Screenplay: Very Bad
The dialogue is atrocious and incredibly unnatural (which makes it very memeable); the humor misses way more than it tries to hit (making the movie unintentionally funny); the symbolism is pretty profound as it lays the groundwork for Anakin to be the chosen one; the foreshadowing is incredible as it helps lay the roots for the entire franchise (especially Anakin's story-arc)Acting: Pretty Bad
Liam Neeson: Good (The true leader of the movie as he uses his experience to act as a father to both Anakin and Obi-wan and guide the story forward)
Ewan McGregor: Pretty Good (Shows promise as Obi-Wan and does as much as he can with the material he is given)
Natalie Portman: Pretty Bad (Such a monotonous performance that is filled with unnatural inflections, but she does show promise in some scenes (meaning these issues have more to do with George Lucas than her))
Jake Lloyd: Decent (He's not as bad as people remember him to be as he carries out what is told from him (the issues from his performance are more from George Lucas))
Ian McDiarmid: Pretty Good (Uses his experience playing the character to fuel his performance)
Anthony Daniels: Good (Feels more like a cameo but continues where he left off)
Kenny Baker: Very Good (Still shows he is the best character and comedic relief in the movie)
Pernilla August: Bad (Has no chemistry with her castmates and is pretty toneless)
Frank Oz: Good (Feels more like a cameo and his puppeteering is replaced with out-of-place CGI in the re-release)
Rest of the cast: Bad (Either the performances are too short to rate or they are just so poorly directed and out of place that they are hard to watch)Score: Brilliant
Some of the best themes in the franchise as he does a good job reusing classics from the original trilogy and creating iconic themes that represent the prequels (like 'Duel of the Fates')Cinematography: Great
Very polished and helps show this galaxy far far away (and all the incredible things in it)Editing: Pretty Bad
It's decent for the most part but the lazy Windows Movie Maker edits hurt this movieSound: Incredible
Star Wars is built on its sounds and they do an incredible job continuing that traditionVisual Effects: Great
Would have been incredible if they used the original release as it is very groundbreaking for the time, but the re-release additions hurt this movie as it feels like there were too many additionsProduction Design: Incredible
Helps build the worlds inside Star WarsMakeup: IncredibleCostumes: IncrediblePacing
Pacing is a bit on the faster side but fine for the most partClimax
Climax is executed very well as it had the best lightsaber duel to date and juggles 3 storylines at onceTone
Tone is very Sci-Fi and Prequel Star Wars (which helps make this movie memey and iconic)Final Notes
My retrospective review of this movie is higher than most because I grew up on these moviesORIGINAL: (05/05/2024)

Acting by the veteran actors was good (Liam Neeson, Ewan McGregor especially, Samuel L Jackson, and Yoda), the acting by those who are not experienced were either pretty bad or very bad, Direction was horrible, Story was great, Screenplay was terrible, Visuals were really good, Score was incredible, Production Design was great, Film aged better than most would have thought, Pacing was really off in the first half.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Beginning.,"This film opens new trilogy in the Star Wars Universe that tells about life's path of Anakin Skywalker. I think that this film is the worst one of prequals. Firstly, the plot is good but sometimes some scenes take too much time and it looks very boring. Secondly, the cast and characters are great, Darth Maul is one the best villain in all saga. But Ja Ja Binks is one of the most annoying character (expecting main characters in new trilogy). Thirdly, the visual effects are wonderful, of course, they are much better than in the first film.
So, this film has a lot of good moments and a lot of disadvantages.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Brand loyalty is a powerful force...,"I think a lot of people giving this movie rave reviews are probably in some sort of denial -- after waiting 20 years for the prequel to the (frankly excellent) Star Wars Trilogy, they just cannot come to terms with the fact that this movie is, frankly awful.  It's not just that Jar Jar is annoying, it's not just that Darth Maul is poorly developed and a thinly-veiled aim at the toys market, it's not just that the ""mitichlorians"" (or however you spell it) is one of the most ridiculous (and unnecessary) story devices of all time, it's not just that this movie could have been a masterpiece for all ages but instead was only palatable by the under-ten crowd or the terminally brand-loyal.  But all of these things combined to create a landmark to disappointment that will stand for all ages.  Oh well...here's hoping Episode II is a step back in the right direction.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
An underrated masterpiece,"This will forever be my favourite Star Wars movie and I'll never understood the hate towards it. I just liked everything about it. The story, the characters, the choreography, the music, the political conflict before the Clone Wars which later led to the birth of the galactic Empire... And we even got podracing, which is like the coolest thing ever. Sorry haters, you can't convince me otherwise. Phantom Menace was and is the best.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Well, it's a start, but get back to business George","In light of all of the glowing reviews, I want to point out some thoughts I had about the movie...1. Get back to business George.  This was not really that much of a compelling story.  Unfortunately that's the duty of the first of any series, to bring everyone up to speed and get the plot flowing.  Lucas himself said that the bulk of the story is in Episode 3.2. Got all the toys... now use them right.  You can definitely tell that ILM had their hands full with all of the effects, characters, etc.  Great job to the ILM team..... BUT Lucas needs to realize that just because you can do it digitally, that doesn't make it better.  I watched Ep IV right before Ep I and found that with all of the glitz and glamour, Ep I did not look ""REAL"". Ep IV has a kind of ""dirt"" on it, since its all real sets.  Ep I is TOO computer generated and makes everything look too perfect...  Come on guys, add some dirt and grease and blast marks to those texture maps...3. Darth Maul was hollow.  He was NOT a compelling villain.  Lucas did nothing to explain him, or to make me hate him, except paint him up like a devil.  I was extremely disappointed. Matter of fact, there was NO really compelling villain.  The federation were cowardly, Palpatine TOO nice, and Sidious too hollow to make any really good villains.I am really looking forward to Ep 2 now though... I have a feeling that Lucas is now watching all of the comments running around and is going to take a lot of it to heart.  Now that he's got the tools, and the experience behind their use, he'll wise up and put it all together.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
An embarrassment,"Finally Lucas' juggernaut arrived, and after seeing it, boy do I want those couple of hours of my life back.I still don't understand how this film didn't get a G rating (maybe because of the trade dispute plot was a bit ""mature"" for kids?). With a few exceptions, everything in the movie is just plain dull. I found it difficult to stay awake through the whole thing.Almost all the great reviews you read for ""Menace"" are from people brainwashed by the marketing (you'll see most of them will defend it with the same ""this is part 1 of 6"" argument). Since I don't trust the level of intelligence of these people (hey, you don't have to trust mine either), the review I'd really love to see is Kevin Smith's: a genuine fan of the series who's also a great director (Clerks, Chasing Amy). Kevin: If you read this, send me a note.Anyway, who cares? This movie will still make more money than god, no matter what people think about it, and that was its purpose in the first place.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
like watching a kid play with muppets,"This movie has to be one of the most disappointing pictures ever released. First a recap of the originals. Star Wars-great, stands on its own; Empire- expands on the first one and goes even deeper; Jedi- Good for kids but just rehashed plots from the first one, also got too cute, but still pretty good. This prequel is only a big expensive toy for George Lucas to play with. Bad script, Bad acting, (esp Jake Lloyd, where was the kid from the Sixth Sense?) with everyone stands around and recites stupid lines, cardboard characters... I can't go on I'm too depressed, taking a great franchise and ruining it. If I sound harsh,I am. These were movies I grew up with and now I have a bad taste in my mouth. I will see the other two coming out because i'm a glutton for punishment. Please Mr. Lucas, make them better. For fans who Star Wars can do no wrong, they will like it anyway. But for movies buffs who just like good movies please don't ruin a once great thing.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
A great entry point to the saga,"The Phantom Menace is the first prequel movie in the Star Wars Saga and while it's a flawed entry it's still a lot of fun. The story follows a Jedi master and student as they attempt to free the planet of Naboo from tyrannical rule.There are plenty of iconic characters introduced here, for better or worse. The visual effects are groundbreaking for the time, especially in the CGI department. The action scenes are well shot and have great choreography.The immersion can be broken sometimes due to overly flashy attacks or general tomfoolery. There's also multiple cringy moments throughout the film. The dialogue can be a bit messy and the delivery can sound forced, but this does lead to plenty of iconic lines. The point is also quite slow in certain segments.This film is a great watch and an excellent way to introduce Star Wars to new generations. It does have quite a few issues but these aren't exclusive and they plague most of the prequels. Don't let the negativity keep you from watching the movie though, the deep political plot presented with the fun of Star Wars works really well.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Relearning appreciation,"Just recently rewatched this film, inspired by CinemaWins, and found lots of good things in it. I love it when people care about the work they do, and The Phantom Menace has many instances of that. So much effort went into music, sound design, casting, CGI, costumes - in fact, if you divorce it from the dialogue, the acting is mostly spot on. (Except for the painful dinner scene on Tatooine, no one was good in it). I was one of those people who watched the prequels before the Original Trilogy and to me Obi Wan Kenobi will always be Ewan McGregor first and Alec Guinness second. First impressions work like that. Liam Neeson managed to create this mystic, this eccentric Jedi who's more of a priest than a warrior. The fact that I understood what kind of a character he was back when I knew precious little about acting - or warrior monks - tells me he did a good job. Ian McDiarmind is so much fun to watch in every scene he's in. Natalie Portman's Padme is an awkward teenager, as I now realise she should be (she's what, fourteen?), and Pernilla August's Shmi Skywalker is the perfect selfless mother of a messiah.Jar Jar Binks...is a burden we must bear, but he is frankly the only thing about this film that I hate unequivocally. I remember loving the prequels (and especially The Phantom Menace) as a kid, and I'm glad to discover some of that warm feeling is still there. I love the distinct sound each podracer makes. Hell, I love Queen Amidala's dresses. There, I've said it. Some of those crazy designs stayed with me for years. Gungan City blew my mind twenty years ago and it still remains one of the more original designs that modern fantasy and sci-fi sorely lack. Coruscant and Naboo were such a welcome reprieve from all the desert planets that seemed to be mandatory for sci-fi films and TV series in the 80s and early 90s (I'm looking at you, Star Trek, Stargate, Dune, Enemy Mine, and others). Yes, The Phantom Menace went back to Tatooine as well, but at least it offered an alternative.I'm glad I have this film another chance. Growing up in the 90s' Khmelnytskyi was tough, but Star Wars helped me get through it. For that, I shall always be grateful.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Episode I was fantastic,Episode I was fantastic. The effects where so good you didn't realize they were only effects. The story was great! The only possible problem was that Jar Jar got a little annoying at times. It was a great movie that I believe lived up to the hype as much as possible.,6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Better than expected,"Well, I've heard a lot about Episode 1. In fact, so much, that I've almost given in to the mostly negative critics and did not watch the movie. Now I'm glad that I did watch it. OK, there are some things that SHOULD have been better: - There was not enough time to develop the characters. - Darth Maul was reduced from a real Jedi-counterpart to a simple villain - In details the movie was too childish Nonetheless, Episode 1 has so much that helped me forget these ""mistakes"" during the movie: It has a superb cast, an excellent music score, really stunning special effects and an exciting story full of action. All in all Episode 1 surely fits not perfect into the Star Wars universe. But you should see it as the first part of a trilogy (as the original Star Wars was, with all its insufficiencies) - and as this, it serves not only well but is a very good start. I do look forward for the next episode, where George Lucas hopefully will erase all the insufficient details.",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
A highly entertaining film for the entire family.,"First off, I can understand why some people were disappointed with this movie: all the advanced hype created advanced expectations that were impossible to meet.  However, I can say that my expectations were more than met when I saw this movie.  That's probably because I didn't have unreasonable expectations going in.  Since this was a ""Star Wars"" movie, I wasn't expecting really deep story-telling or Oscar caliber acting.  All I was expecting was that the film would provide me with two hours of exceptional entertainment like the first trilogy did and I felt ""The Phantom Menace"" succeeded admirably in that respect.  The film contains some of the most phenomenal effects I have ever seen, spectacular action scenes and another great score from John Williams.  So, it seems to me that this film delivered everything the first three films did.  There were flaws, however. The film doesn't really stand on its own (but really, only ""A New Hope"" does) and seems like a teaser for the rest of the saga.  The acting is competent for the most part, but everyone has moments (some more than others) where they are pretty mediocre.  There is also the tendency for banal dialogue.  In other words, this film has more or less the same flaws as the earlier films.  As for the complaints that this was a ""kiddie"" film, remember that the ""Star Wars"" movies are supposed to be family films.  A family film MUST appeal to children as well as containing elements that adults can enjoy.  Since I highly enjoyed this film, I conclude that TPM is a great family movie.  One last thing: I liked Jar Jar Binks for most of the film.  I just think he needs to be toned down a bit for the next installments.Overall, I'm giving ""The Phantom Menace"" ****1/2 (out of *****).",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
The force begins,"In what begins the auspicious chapter of a much greater story is a film of set pieces. George Lucas certainly has an affinity for laying all the cards on the table in his epic storylines. It is as if a book comes to life in chapters, beginning with The Phantom Menace.I am seeing this for the first time since it's inception in theaters in 1999. It is 2018 and I am by and large a Star Wars fan.I enjoyed the setting of where Anakin came from, how Yoda was a set piece in the Jedi council and the introduction of the infamous Jar-Jar Binks. we also get to see the very first images of Jabba the Hut.The elements of the story set up the foreground of Obi-Wan and him taking Anakin on as his Apprentice. I think both Liam Neeson/Ewan McGregor did admirable jobs in their performances. Natalie Portman, although gorgeous comes across very flat and uninteresting as the Queen. Anakin portrayed by Jake Lloyd in my opinion as a little boy was to bland as the young Skywalker.Over all I enjoyed the plot, the special effects and production. If your a Star Wars fan you will enjoy how the whole story begins. I give this a 7 out of 10",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
A lot better than the critics said it was,"I remember walking out of the theater 2 years ago after having seen this, and thinking ""That was a damned good movie, I sure got my money's worth!"" Well, didn't take long to find out not everyone shared my sentiments. I guess it was to be expected. After all the hype and the waiting, the fans wanted nothing less than for George Lucas to smash a grand slam homer right out of the park, so when instead he hit a solid triple, a lot of people felt cheated and let down, and so they focused on what they didn't get more than on what was delivered.Which is a shame. Phantom Menace is a fine film in its own rights. In part, some of the complaints were because it was different from the others. Most notably, the comradeship of familiar characters was missing, the interplay between the heroes, heroines and sidekicks as they grew to trust each other and deal with their various character traits as they bounced from one close call to the next. There was no romance to speak of (unlike the great Han Solo/Princess Leia exchanges) nor was there much humor (as in the interplay between Chewbacca and the two droids) and of course the central character is one we all know will soon transform into the evil villain of the first trilogy. In short, it simply doesn't have a lot of the key elements that everyone loved from the earlier films.But so what? Like I said, this one is different, and should be judged on its own merits. What is good about this film? For starters, the awesome effects. Let's face it, that's what MADE the Star Wars franchise, lose them, and you've just got a pretty decent space fairy tale. There's some really cool concepts, too, I especially liked the various types of Battle Droids, and would not be surprised to see this idea become reality in our own military some time in the near future. Also, you've got a deeper, darker, more serious mood. There's not too much in the way of yuks and joking around because anyone with vision can see that this particular Galaxy is headed for serious trouble. There's Natalie Portman as Queen Amidala, who, IMHO, is an even better female lead than Carrie Fisher. She's got the same strength of character, only in a different guise. Instead of a feisty, resourceful rebel Princess, she, despite being only 18 or so, leads with great dignity and poise. Darth Maul is another great character, the only downside is he wasn't given more screen time. Young Annakin Skywalker comes off just as we'd expect, he's a slave, but clearly destined to move on to much bigger things. We are left wondering just how it is this budding Jedi ends up making the choice to side with evil, not to mention how he will interact with his future wife and son. We are left hanging deliciously, wondering just what Episode Two will serve up.As for the bad, well, basically it can be summed up in three words  Jar Jar Binks. Rarely has a more annoying and useless character been given so much screen time in a major movie. He's funny .. for maybe a minute or two. Then he should have been given the boot. Yet he seems to be onscreen almost as much as Luke in the original! What on Earth for? He brings nothing to the film to justify being so prominent. Further, he turns an otherwise spectacular final battle scene into a 3 Stooges style comic farce in which he blunders about the battlefield taking out the enemy through sheer incompetence and dumb luck (maybe I should change the comic reference to Gomer Pyle). Anyway, if ever this film is subject to digital editing, Jar Jar should be `erased' from every scene where it is practical to do so. On a more minor note, I was less impressed than most by the Pod Race. Sure, it was cool but so is an Eddie Van Halen guitar solo. And both are more a case of artistic showing off than anything else. The Pod Race was special effects for its own sake, and didn't really add anything of importance to the movie.But, other than that, this was definitely a far better than average film. It's just too bad that didn't live up to public expectations that were, quite honestly, so high as to be nearly impossible for mere mortal man to achieve.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"A longer time ago,a more boring movie","Otherwise known as ""Star Wars-Episode One"" - the 1st chapter in what is now planned as a 6-part movie series. The 2nd chapter arrived in 2002. So all we have here is basically an introduction to a 12-hour movie. And boy, do we feel it. The plot has something to do with heavy taxes being perpetrated by the nasty 'Trade Federation.' Two Jedi Knights are dispatched to negotiate. It doesn't go well. We are (re-) introduced to R2D2 & C3PO (who is being built by young Annakin Skywalker, the future Darth Vader - Eegads!). In the end, we have a huge battle on 3 fronts, highlighted by the light-saber duel between the 2 Jedi knights and Darth Maul - a Sith Lord. Why are they all fighting? And why not send 4 Jedi knights or 6, to simplify matters a bit? All the escalating problems in the next two films could have been avoided if the so-called wise Jedi Council distributed their warriors a bit more efficiently, rather than being stuck in this '2' mode. To me, the most interesting aspects of this flic is making the various connections between this movie and the ones already made which take place in the near future. For example, there is the other Sith Lord (the master - they always come in twos ... say what? - if you know they come in twos, then send four..never mind), who is obviously the evil emperor from ""Return of the Jedi""(83), and played by the same actor. Then there's the hint that Annakin did not have a father - what's all that about? And these microscopic beings that live in everyone's blood symbiotically? Hah? Like ""Star Trek the Motion Picture""(79), this film is easier to watch a 2nd time around, when one can relax and not worry about missing a line of dialog which explains half the plot. The obvious weakness to the flic is that after writing it, George Lucas doesn't have much directing to do: what's left is for his FX technicians to plan the high-speed action races, create the many creatures, and visualize the city-scapes on several worlds. By Golly. And I didn't even mention Jar-Jar once.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Watchable but a lack of depth,"You enjoyment of ""the Phantom Menace"" will depend on your state of mind. I better appreciated it by following the plot in a somehow passive manner. Again, it's the loose acting behind the characters that make the story lag behind....The ""pairs"" are much too polished and similar in temper to be trusted ""Padme and ""Any"" (sic), Qi-gong and Obi Wan, Darth Sidious and his apprentice... And CGIs everywhere my friend, not only in the air and on the planets, but also under the sea (was this scene a advertising for Marinas ?). One thing I hated was the costumes of the Queen soldiers, and their exaggerated non-violent behaviour.We feel that Qi Gong is being threatened by an invisible menace by his lack of attention : for example in the presence of Anakin, hence the title, I presume.I would say that the weakness of the whole Star Wars trilogy is its predictability, and its strengh lies in the philosophical, ecological and mystical implications of the concept of ""the Force"".So why such a high grade ? Well, because *something* had to be done for the fans back in 1999, and I am sure G. Lucas prequel needed some more time to reach the heights of IV,V,VI in terms of character development and narrative depth.A last quibble, if I were a kid, I would only buy the plastic characters, 'cause the flying saucers look too futuristic to me. Hey, give us back x-wings, t-fighters and al, so that people spend time building those things with their own hands ! Oh yes, the lightsaber battle that concluded the movie was breathtaking and moving, I fully agree with that.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
I enjoyed Phantom Menace in 3d,"I had seen this when it came out over 10 years ago and was very disappointed at the time. Mostly because my expectations were so high after having seen and loved the original trilogy so much as a kid. I went to take my son to see Hugo a couple weeks ago in 3d, but Star Wars Episode I had replaced it in the 3d theater, so we watched Phantom Menace instead.My son is a big fan of the Clone Wars on the cartoon network. He loved this movie. As a seven year old, he would give it a 10.I actually liked the movie better this time around. It looked very visually impressive in 3d. I wasn't put off as much by the plot since I already had seen it.And unlike everyone else, I love Jar Jar Binks ... no seriously. I was friends with Amhed Best at Columbia High School in Maplewood, NJ. He was in the drum section of our orchestra (and I played cello). Even back then he used to always do that Jar Jar Binks voice (which we thought was funny back then - we didn't know it would become a universally loathed voice of a space alien :) He did the most amazing tympani solo in Also Sprach Zarathustra that you could imagine. He made the auditorium (which was huge) completely fill with a thunderous cacophony of noise - it was amazing. I read that he got the part because he was in an all drum off-Broadway production that George Lucas (or maybe it was his wife) went to see and they cast him for the part.Back to the movie: The effects definitely looked better this time around. I don't know if they redid some of the CG to make it 3D, but it just looked better.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Not a Beatle reunion, but no Wham reunion, either","Okay, full disclosure here. I am old enough to have been alive when the first Star Wars film came out (I saw it in 1977 at age 11) and thus likely to be one of those fogies old enough to hold a grudge against a film that isn't up to snuff in my view for what the saga represents. Except I think this film was better than either the Star Wars film that came before (""Revenge Of The Jedi"") or after (""Attack Of The Clones."") More than that, ""Phantom Menace"" is good. Not great, but good.Considering this is where the whole ""Star Wars"" story is supposed to take off, it could be worse. I like the opening act, which whips by in just five minutes. Jedi Knights Qui-Gon Jinn (Liam Neeson) and Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan MacGregor) start out bored emissaries and wind up energized fugitives. Their arrival and subsequent escape from the blockade vessel is not a masterpiece, but it is exciting and propels interest in the film which it manages to sustain for the first hour or so. It's cool how the Jedi dispatch their robot attackers so that we see their decapitated stumps still glowing from the lightsaber cuts, and how the battle droids clatter so convincingly into metal heaps on the floor.We never get much more than this, however. The two Jedi meet a ""local,"" one Jar-Jar Binks, who offers some comedy to the proceedings. He's never quite funny, but given the otherwise severe tone of this picture, his goofiness is welcome to me. A lot of people cry about Jar-Jar being where the kids took over the franchise. Actually, the kids began running the franchise in 1977, but that was when my generation were the kids and the 40-year-olds didn't much care about this sci-fi claptrap. Frankly, the atmosphere begins getting uneasily infantile not with Jar-Jar but with his Gungan cohorts, who are as cartoony as Jar-Jar but much harder to take as they become the central focus of the plot, rather than just the goofy sideline spectator Jar-Jar is. Anyway, Jar-Jar's Buster Keaton hi-jinks during the final battle is one of the most entertaining parts of the film.John Williams throws in some solid music, chorales this time, unexpected but nice and in keeping with the best of his previous efforts. At least one `Star Wars' vet was still energized. George Lucas however seems to lose interest halfway through the film, after the podrace, probably the only part of this film anyone will be talking about in five years. There again, you have a little boy winning, and a sense of Lucas plotting-though-demographics. But Anakin is supposed to be a special little boy, and we are told the podrace is his element. More annoying is his role at the controls of a starfighter at the final resolution, saying a lot of corny lines like `Hold on, Artoo' as presumably practiced fighter pilots and expertly crafted droids lose all cohesion and cunning around him. Anakin's antics here feel like a form of heavy-duty blandishment to `Phantom Menace's' core consumer audience, more ingratiating than any the `Star Wars' series offered before. At least the older films pretended to have an adult focus.But forgive me. It's hard to get too angry at a movie that asks you to pay close attention to Natalie Portman and Keira Knightley and notice which is which. Actually, the most beautiful female in this movie is probably Pernilla August, who delivers a note-perfect characterization of Anakin's mother. What a face, and what eyes. August makes you feel the overwhelming nature of material devotion and envy the recipient. The acting in this film is otherwise never great, but not bad, either. Liam is solid in the lead role of Qui-Gon, while Jake Lloyd is an alright mini-Darth, looking alternately sharp and innocent. I like one scene where he explains the price of a slave's disobedience is that ""They BLOW you up,"" slamming the table for emphasis. You can feel Imperial generals of the future fingering their collars during that scene.So it's not `Star Wars.' It's not `Empire Strikes Back.' It's not even a real film in the sense you have to know the earlier films, if not actually watched them, to be properly cognizant of what is going on here. But `Phantom' is good entertainment, albeit for a less discriminating age than the one that gave this oeuvre life.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

"Disappointing eye-candy, hype-fueled mess","Star Wars, the Phantom Menace, is perhaps one of the most disappointing movies of all time, but that's not so much the director to blame, but also the fact we all were expecting almost the Second Coming, and then, all we got was just a mediocre movie, with boring characters, boring story, and a bunch of eye-candy. George Lucas should have known that special effects without a good story aren't impressive anymore. In the seventies, watching ""Star Wars"", the ""fairy tale in space with cool effects"" was ground breaking, because it mixed a recognizable story ""peasant saves the princess and becomes a knight"" with a creative environment. But in the 90s, watching ""a pointless tale with computer effects"" was just boring.This movie isn't the ""worst movie ever made"", but it's just boring: it hasn't any endurable or classic value as the original trilogy. The characters are undeveloped or just annoying (and borderline racist), the story is a pseudo-political fiasco with boring dialog (""but the fans won't accept these are movies for kids!"", yeah, kids are eager to watch arguments about taxes, trade federations, bureaucracy, etc.), which sums up the dullness of the movie. George Lucas is telling us: take my eye-candy, and buy tickets and props, you mindless drones.Of course, fan-boys who like this movie will try to justify everything: ""The plot DOES make sense"", ""the story DOES make sense"", ""Lucas had it all planned from the beginning"", guess what: all the explanations and justifications won't make this movie more entertaining.3/10",3.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
A victim of the cynical and politically correct 90s...,"I went to this movie to watch one of my all-time favorite movie series: Star Wars.  I watched, was entertained, and left.  Phantom Menace did an excellent job of setting the beginning of the Star Wars story.  The acting fit the movie (no bad performances) and the special effects and action superb.No we get to the serious matter.  For people to call the character Jar-Jar Binks a ""racist"" character is INCREDIBLY STUPID!  I am an African-American that is active in the NAACP.  I laughed when I saw Jar-Jar.  He was funny (and a little irritating).  The young man who played as Jar-Jar (an African-American) said that the character has alot of him in it.  His only frame of reference was his African-American upbringing.  Jar-Jar is not even close to the stereotypes in early movies depicting blacks and stupid, lazy, and slow-witted.I find it funny that people just overlook what Jar-Jar and his people did: Fight a battle against an enormous army of robots in defense of their way of life.  A slow-witted, lazy, and stupid people INDEED!  Fine if you thought the movie was dull or lacked character development.  BUT, to go with ""Jar-Jar is racist"" theme is ignorant, stupid, and DOWNRIGHT ABSURD!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"The ""Pete's Dragon"" Menace","What is this menace which threatens our very way of life? It's not the lure of the Dark Side or unfair trade practices. It's something much more evil and sinister - the excessive use of computer animation. I like cartoons as much as anyone, but do they really belong standing among our favorite live-action Sci-fi heroes? This is something you'd expect from some low-budget, Ed Wood-type B-movie, but not from the great George Lucas, a man with unlimited time, budget, resources, etc. to make this movie with. How is it possible that with 10+ years of advancement, the special effects of this movie still leave me yearning for the stop-action Tauntauns from ""The Empire Strikes Back""? But it's not entirely the obviously unbalanced ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"" appearance that gives it its cartoonish quality. It's also (if not more so) the hideously unfunny personality of Jar Jar Binks, who could only entertain someone with the IQ of Bantha fodder. That's not to say that it isn't an otherwise great movie. There are excellent scenes. Qui-gon Jinn and Obi-wan's dual with Darth Maul almost made me forget the Saturday morning cartoon I had been watching only moments earlier. When people say this movie is a masterpiece, I agree. It's just unfortunate there's so many awful things about it that also make it a flop. I'll be looking forward to the Special Edition version where they superimpose a realistic-looking and much less idiotic character on top of Jar Jar.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
my two pence,"Well I was very disappointed by this movie. No, Jar Jar doesn't bother me in the slightest, my gripe boils down to the script which i found to be both lazy (phantom is just a remake of Jedi, and New Hope, exactly the same things happen in three star wars movies now), and contradictory to the original films which maintain that Yoda taught Obi wan, not Quai Gon Who? One of the most irritating parts was the science, blood tests and midi clorians (excuse the spelling) seem so out of place in star wars, explaining ""the force"", and Jedi in this way is akin to dissecting dragons and unicorns. To sum up i wish this film didn't seem so rushed as it does script wise, well there's always the next two films.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Disappointing to a Star Wars Fanatic.,"The Phantom Menace had such a different feel than than the original trilogy.  It didn't have that Star Wars feel.  All in all it was a rather disappointing film.  Not a lot of story and too many computer generated effects.  Lucas could have done so much more.  I thought it was totally predicable and really didn't give us die hard Star Wars fanatics any new info on the galaxy far far away.  All I can say is...George baby, spend more time on the story.  I'd be real disappointed to find out that I know everything that is going to happen.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
I Don't Like This Movie...BUT...,"Ladies and gentlemen of IMDb, I know you've spent many, many years watching or reading countless reviews bashing this movie. What I need to tell you won't take very long at all; I don't like ""Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace."" I don't expect you to like it. It has oodles of horrendous dialogue even by the low standards of the Saga, it's been a destructive force in the reputation of the otherwise underrated and masterful ""Star Wars"" prequels, it joins ""The Force Awakens"" as one of only two ""Star Wars"" movies I refuse to watch when marathoning the Saga. I don't like it. But this isn't a popularity contest. It's a movie review. And subjective opinions aside...""The Phantom Menace"" IS a good movie.I'll start out with the cons, as there are some EXTREMELY big ones. First of, Jar Jar Binks. While some people take the hatred of the character too far (Calling him a racist stereotype? SERIOUSLY?), he's still pretty unfunny and just downright detestable. I am a fervent believer in the ""Darth Jar Jar"" theory which insists that Jar Jar was ORIGINALLY intended to be a dark mirror to Yoda (The seemingly insignificant, annoying comic relief-esque character who turns out to possess great wisdom, power and knowledge), but because the idea was abandoned after Jar Jar's awful fan reception, he just ends up as a wholly distracting and painfully irritating failed ""comedic"" character. A shame, as if previously mentioned fan theory were correct and followed through, we could have had a villain as epic and sinister in scale as the Emperor himself.The child actors are absolutely abysmal. Jake Lloyd as little Anakin Skywalker is JUST as bad as everyone says he is. Every time he opens his mouth to speak, I get a little tingle in my fingers to press the mute button to silence his wooden, obnoxious delivery. True, he's not helped by the fact the film features some of the worst dialogue in the Saga (""Are you an angel?""), but I can easily imagine a child actor like Daeg Faerch or Brady Allen running circles around Lloyd's ""acting.""Natalie Portman is similarly awful as Padme Amidala. While I greatly enjoyed her performances in ""Attack of the Clones"" and ""Revenge of the Sith"", she is totally out of her element here. She seems to have adopted Carrie Fisher's knack for ""on again, off again"" British accents and constantly changing her approach to the character.Ewan McGregor is simply boring as Obi Wan Kenobi in ""The Phantom Menace"" with next to NO personality or even desire. As Robert McKee from Adaptation says, ""You cannot have a protagonist without desire, it doesn't make any SENSE!"" Granted, like Portman he would vastly improve in ""Attack of the Clones"", but in ""The Phantom Menace"" he's merely a blank slate.If you thought the tonal shifts in ""Return of the Jedi"" were jarring and awful, ""The Phantom Menace"" will all but drive you insane. One minute you'll have very serious, intellectual discussion of the Republic debating how to deal with an ominous trade blockade or Darth Maul brooding alongside his evil master Darth Sidious, and the next minute you'll have Jar Jar stepping in crap and smelling Eopie farts. It makes immersion into the film almost impossible.With all that being said though, the film does enough right for me to BARELY consider it good. The introduction of complex world politics to the universe of ""Star Wars"" is refreshing and fascinating. I love seeing how the Republic works in terms of its government and decision making, and kudos to Lucas for giving the bad guys more of a complex and realistic plan than merely blowing up planets with a giant laser.Liam Neeson is outstanding as Qui Gonn Jinn, a character so fascinating and with so much depth that it makes me even more frustrated with how poorly his original trilogy equivalent Ben Kenobi was written in ""A New Hope."" He has the wisdom and stoicism you'd expect, but his rebellious, chaotic ""ends justify the means"" approach to solving problems is surprising and makes for a more interesting mentor figure. At the same time, he is incredibly empathetic and loyal to those close to him, seeing the value in those who may not even see it in themselves. Neeson does an excellent job balancing Qui Gonn's warmth, wisdom, passion and intensity in a very nuanced performance that is easily the best in the movie. Not often do we have anti-establishment mentors in science fantasy, and when we do it's rarely as subtle as with Qui Gonn in ""Episode I."" Thus when he loses his life at the hands of the demonic Darth Maul in the film's climactic lightsaber duel, it truly stung me emotionally. It's a vast improvement over Ben Kenobi's emotionally barren death in ""A New Hope.""While the jarring shifts in tone may be distracting, the film does at least touch on some clever themes. The idea and message of symbiosis (Multiple organisms working together for mutual benefit) is consistent throughout the movie through its characters and relationships as well as the concept of the symbiotic midichlorians; microscopic organisms that represent Jedi's connection to the Force. Many critics have pointed out that midichlorians remove the mysticism behind the Force, but perhaps we're looking at it from the wrong view. Perhaps midichlorians are created through force of will and faith, rather merely existing immediately upon birth regardless of will. It's at the very least a thought provoking concept.People have gone all out on their criticism of ""The Phantom Menace."" They're throwing everything but the kitchen sink at this movie. I can't change your opinion on the film whatever it is, and I wouldn't want too. I merely ask one thing; I want you to ask yourself, is not liking this movie reason enough to call it ""one of the worst movies ever made?""",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Initial Reaction,"This is a review from a fan's perspective upon my first viewing in '99. This review will not focus on the positive and negative things, big and little; there are plenty of other reviews here that will do that. This is a professed Star Wars fan's initial reaction from over a decade ago when I saw it, that hasn't much changed since.The original film was the VERY FIRST film I ever saw when it was first out in theatres. I was a mere nine months old, but my parents said I loved it. Like everyone else who grew-up on Star Wars, I was also caught-up in the hype and would have severed a (minor) appendage in order to see it first. So on opening day, I went to see it after work with some like-minded friends.I remember the movie was something like thirty minutes in (somewhere around the underwater Gungan scene) and I was thinking, ""When is this thing really gonna start?"" By this point in the originals, the sand people were causing havoc, Imperial Walkers were about to start something in the snow and Luke was escaping the ultimate monster in the basement.""Maybe because this is the beginning of the whole saga, the pieces have to be set-up first,"" I remember thinking. ""Okay, I'll give it time.""Then we got to the pod race almost half-way through the movie. ""Now we're talking!"" I thought, ""THIS is Star Wars!"" And it was truly breathtaking. It lived up to what Star Wars had been before, but it didn't last long. The story moves soon after to Courescant and devolved into C-SPAN. Political maneuvering, Anakain's ""college"" acceptance interview, blah...blah...blah...Then there was the ending. Everything felt forced, except for the lightsabre duel. Between this and the pod race, it made the movie. The pure physicality of it made me tingle. But yet even here, there was something missing; tension. Here were two jedi squaring off against a really cool bad guy, Darth Maul. This guy was the Boba Fett of the prequel trilogy; cool baddie, too little screen time. We all knew that Obi Wan was gonna live, so that released some of the tension, but that wasn't quite it. In the original, we had Obi Wan vs. Vader; former teacher taking on his old student and dying in the process. In Empire we had Luke avenging his fallen buddy and in Jedi it was the re-match, now knowing the family connection. In Menace, it was like the interstellar Don King had just made a match, they combatants showed up and cameras rolled. It was a sight to see, but the tension created by emotion just wasn't there.The movie ended and we left the theatre. I felt strangely numb to it all. ""Maybe it was me?"" I speculated. ""Maybe I'm on an off day? Maybe the hype prepared me for more than this could ever truly deliver?"" Maybe. But as we were all walking out, these were guys 'n gals that loved Star Wars like I had. We looked forward to this like Christmas morning, yet Santa Lucas brought us socks. Bulky, itchy socks. But we had to act like we loved it, lest we be run out of town.Each of us went to see it again in the days following, but went alone. Each of us. We all felt the same way, but wouldn't admit it to one another until a few weeks later. One of us bravely asked the rest if we MAYBE didn't really like the movie all that much. Episode I became the highest grossing movie of the year and with the entire saga and is one of the most financially successful movies ever made. Know why? Everybody had to see it multiple times just to know for sure that the reason it wasn't so good wasn't because of our over-hyped nostalgia.The bottom line is this; its not a bad film. Its not a great film, but it is entertaining and quite a spectacle. It does not, by a long shot, live up to the standard set by the original trilogy. Could it ever? That is a good question and up for debate. But when Episode III came out, that was the one that I had waited since the new films were announced to see. I consider it to be the third best of the entire saga, better than Jedi. So the excuse that the new films could not live up to the original I feel is not true. The focus here was trying to force a square story into a round hole and make things fit, come hell, high-water or midichlorins. It was a display to show what George Lucas likes best; the technical side of filmmaking.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Honestly, My Least Favorite Star Wars Film","The Phantom Menace is usually the one Star Wars film that most fans can agree as the worst. Why exactly? Well I'll get to that.The plot takes place years before the original Star Wars and follows a young Obi Wan Kenobi(Ewan McGregor) and his Jedi master Qui-Gon Jinn(Liam Neeson). They are sent to the planet of Naboo to negotiate peace terms between Naboo and the Trade Federation. The Federation does not want peace and conquers the planet holding the Queen at hostage. The two land on the planet and meet a Gungan native named Jar Jar Binks. He leads them to the capital city where they rescue the Queen and several others and retreat to another planet.They stop on the planet of Tatooine to find another fuel source and meet a young Anakin Skywalker(Jake Lloyd). Qui-Gon senses the force is strong with him and takes him with them to Coruscant to have trained to become a Jedi.But a new threat is rising and the shadow of the Sith is returning to the galaxy. The mysterious Darth Maul is sent to assassinate the Jedi and the Trade Federation is not going to give up Naboo anytime soon. The battle to start it all is about to begin.The plot sounds like a Star Wars movie but there's something about Phantom Menace that seems off to me. For one thing, most of the actors are all pretty good for their own right. But either a bad script or bad direction makes most of the dialog feel unnatural. Sure Star Wars has never been one for normal conversation between characters but the older movies seemed to do it more casually.And here's the big thing that most people thought was wrong about this movie. The comic relief. No I don't mean C3PO or R2D2 they're as good as ever, I mean Jar Jar Binks. His character is the definition of pandering to the kids. He doesn't do much of anything except lead them to his home and then just sticks around for the rest of the movie not doing anything but looking like an idiot. His character could've been handled a lot better.And another big factor is the performance of Jake Lloyd as Anakin Skywalker. He's too normal. He has a happy life, a good relationship with his mother and all around likes everything. So how is there supposed to be darkness in his heart or whatever? He's the chosen one sure but you're not gonna expect us to think the whole Darth Vader thing just came out of nowhere are you? On top of that the way he delivers his lines are just wrong. He seems to just have one personality. Obnoxiousness. It's really off-putting.Another nitpick is Yoda. He's supposed to be younger here but he looks a thousand years older. Whoever designed the puppet for this movie really didn't do their homework. Frank Oz is still great but I'm wondering why he looked so off.But still the movie does deliver on its action scenes. While the first battle with Darth Maul and the space battle feel rushed and not as epic as they could've been, the fight with Maul near the end of the film is spectacular. And the Pod-Race at the middle is pretty intense too.So yeah this movie isn't my favorite of the Saga but I don't think it's horrible. Maybe the hype was too much. Maybe the film just couldn't live up to the expectations. Maybe it wasn't entirely Jake Lloyd's fault that Anakin was so annoying and more bad direction or script. Any way you look at it the film just doesn't really deliver(at least for me).But even though this movie is my least favorite, I can always watch it whenever I have a Star Wars marathon. And more than likely I'll go see it in 3D. It's still Star Wars, and worth at least one watch.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
A good family action entertainer,"I have never been a great fan of space movies as I find the weird faces and clownish attires rather repulsive. However, it was recommended to me by a french student who came to visit my college in very strong terms.

I think it is very well made and at least the children are sure to like it. The ""natural"" emotions of the unnatural characters were particularly appealing and the setting of the scenes very excellent. However, there is nothing special about performance of the actors.

Not as bad as everyone seems to think...,"I can remember the first time I saw Episode 1, years ago when I was still in high school. I recall coming out of the theater, mostly pleased. I had a sweet lightsaber duel with my cousin (my cousin pretended to be Darth Maul). I thought it was a fairly good movie and that was that.Then the talk came the next day in school. People on the net were really blasting Episode 1 - was my memory really THAT faulty? Yes, the movie was pretty bad compared to Empire Strikes Back, but so is 95% of the stuff that passes for sci-fi these days. Why weren't they comparing Episode 1 to modern sci-fi like Event Horizon or Virus? Surely Episode 1 was better than those movies.People seem to have some kind of huge attachment to the Star Wars franchise. I mean, when you have movies with entirely different casts (save for Frank Oz as Yoda), you're going to have entirely different levels of quality. Let's face it, Ewan McGregor is no Alec Guiness, Liam Neeson is no Harrison Ford, and Jake Lloyd is certainly no Mark Hamill. Lucas was dealing with inferior actors...of course the acting would be inferior.Then there's Jar Jar. Well, slap my tail and call me crazy, but I don't think Lucas meant Jar Jar as a racist character. I think he wanted a fanciful alien companion for Anakin, and he went too far. Edit the movie a bit, and Jar Jar becomes a non-factor. C3PO and R2 did some pretty stupid stuff in their day, too.I think Episode 1 is a decent movie. Nothing particularly good, but nothing to justify a 1/10 score. It has one of the best, if not THE best lightsaber fights in the series, it has a nifty pod-racing sequence, and it has Natalie Portman.

"Good idea, not executed as well as it could have been","I have two main problems with this movie. Number one, I think we all know what this one is, Jar Jar. I don't think Jar Jar is bad in all scene, in fact, there are two scenes I actually genuinely find funny. Other than those, he just gets redundant and annoying, and just pointless. The second thing is the Trade Federation. They are trying to get the queen to sign a treaty to make their invasion legal. There is no way to defend this, that is just plain stupid. I don't mind the politics, it's just the fact that the whole storyline is based on taxes and treaties and that crap. The overall storyline moves pretty fast and is relatively exciting. This movie has good effects (for the most part) and has really cool action scenes. There are some line deliveries that the respective actor kind-of butchered, it's not bad, the lines are just stale and dull. The only actors that applies to though are Jake Lloyd and Natalie Portman, but I think they do fine. I don't hate Jake Lloyd as young Anakin, I think he actually perfectly shows what would be a kid Darth Vader. Liam Neeson, Ewan McGregor, Ray Parker all do fantastic in their roles. Ray Parker makes an excellent Darth Maul. I am also a big fan of Darth Maul.

"Not a Ground-Breaking Success, But Not a Menace","I'm a Star Wars fan, and always have been. In fact, I saw ""A New Hope"" for the first time at one of its re-releases at age one and immediately fell in love with the franchise. For this reason, I was enormously excited when I found that a new prequel to the series was being created. Needless to say, I was disappointed by the film.I expected to see an adolescent cool-cat Anakin step up and turn bad. Instead, I got a terrible child actor trying to save his mother and not even bearing a hint of his imminent future. I expected immense and glorious space battles, but instead got a particularly boring scene in which the above-mentioned child takes on a fleet of comically ridiculous droid fighters. I was expecting to see storm troopers marching around in some form, but all i got was some dorky droids.Iwasn't happy about the film.However, now that I have viewed the entire new trilogy, the film makes more sense, though not much. It seems to lack any real plot developments in the long run, unlike Episodes Two and Three. Still, the film is visually competent, and it is nice to see the first modern interpretation of the Star Wars galaxy since the early 1980s. There's also another factor that bumped my score up from a 4 or 5 to a 6. This factor is Darth Maul.Darth Maul is one of the coolest Star Wars villains in the history of the films, falling short of Vader and Boba Fett, but falling only a small bit short of General Greivous. His scenes are the high points of the film. They are fast-paced, fun, and truly suspenseful. More importantly, they take us away from Jake Lloyd and Natalie Portman, who give awful performances. This film is not even in the same league as any of the original trilogy, and it falls short of the other two newer ones. However, it's not a terrible film, and can be enjoyed.Warning: Make sure that you take a bathroom break anytime an alien called Jar Jar Binks comes on-screen to truly enjoy the experience.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Unimaginably turgid rubbish,"I recently saw this film on video, the first time I'd sat through it since last Summer. I was amazed to find it was even worse than I had originally thought. The lack of a plot of any description is a serious problem, but only one among many. The script seems to have been fine-tooth-combed to remove any sense of identity or individuality on the part of the characters, giving the performances the air of those in a school play scripted by a 12 year old. Let's not even bother with the fact that the effects are abysmal and the enemy storm troopers have the prescence and menace of a glove puppet.But worst of all; how could Lucas possibly have been happy with the performance of Jake Lloyd, and the excrutiating scenes where he is talking with children his own age before the pod race?I defy any adult who cares about film to enjoy this appalling tosh.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Not a Good Introduction to the Star Wars Universe,"After 16 long years, George Lucas continued his Star Wars saga with this prequel, set roughly 30 years before the original trilogy. When I first saw this movie, I looked forward to learning about the events that led up to the original Star Wars trilogy, how the Old Republic governed itself, how Jedi were selected, trained and initiated, and how the Empire rose to power. But it turned out I learned very little from this latest installment. The characters Obi-Wan Kenobi and his master Qui-Gon Jinn are introduced, but the characters are not developed well. I didn't feel like I got to know either of these characters. Plot elements are hinted at rather than thoroughly explained. They mention the ""trials"" that a Jedi must go through without explaining what they are, or why Master Qui-Gon is being kept out of the Jedi Council. There is a new villain in this movie, Darth Maul, who I learned even less about. In one of his few lines he mentions a desire for revenge- revenge for what, exactly? Nothing is explained in this movie. Instead we are transported from one place to another as Obi-Wan and Qui-Gon fight off armies of droids with their lightsabers. Good action scenes and great digital graphics, but without good dialog the story is empty of meaning. Good points- the trip through the planet core, the pod race, introduction to the Jedi Council and the Republic Senate, and Darth Maul's two-bladed light saber. Bad points- Jar Jar Binks & the rest of the Gungans, Anakin (sorry, he was way too chipper), plot and dialog. I recommend skipping this chapter of the saga and starting off with Attack of the Clones. 4 out of 10.",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"OK, People.  Let's all calm down","I was just looking at a number of the negative user reviews for Episode 1, and most of them find fault with really bad acting.With that in mind, I pose the following question to all of you.  With the possible exceptions of Harrison Ford and Alec Guiness, who ""DIDN'T"" do terrible acting jobs in the first three films?All three films from the original trilogy still rank very high among my favorite films of all time, but when I look back on them now, it's painfully obvious how whiny Mark Hamill's Luke is.  And let's talk about the woeful hyperbolic rantings of Carrie Fisher's Princess Leia.  Has anybody else ever wondered why Mark Hamill can't get arrested in Hollywood now?  Has anybody else wondered why Carrie Fisher became a writer?  BECAUSE THEY COULDN'T ACT!!!!!  But does that matter within the Star Wars context?  Of course not.So why should it matter that Jake Lloyd sounds pretty whiny himself?  One could argue ""Like Father, Like Son!""  Maybe Luke picked up a tendency to whine from his Dad!And don't pick on Liam Neeson and Ewan MacGregor.  They're playing Jedi Knights, for God's sake!  They're not supposed to have personalities that jump off the screen.And quit picking on Jar-Jar.  Yes, he can be annoying, butC3-PO, R2-D2, Chewbacca, The Ewoks, and even Yoda had their truly annoying moments.  Heck, Yoda's still a crotchety old curmudgeon.I'm afraid people expected the same revelatory experience from Episode 1 that they received watching ""Star Wars.""  But let's face it--we live in a radically different world now, and films such as Episode 1 can't possibly have the same impact that ""Star Wars"" did.  However, I will still look forward to owning this film, and the complete sextet, once it's available.(IF I WERE TO COMPLAIN ABOUT ANYTHING--IT'S THAT THEY'RE NOT AVAILABLE ON DVD.

A Weak Entry in the Star Wars Saga,"I gave ""Episode 1"" a pass when it was first released in 1999. All the hype and hoopla surrounding the release was a real turn-off.  I couldn't understand the people that were paying full fare theater admission, not to see the feature, but solely to view the ""Episode 1"" trailer. As the actual release approached people began queuing for tickets weeks in advance, and bidding up the admission cost to hundreds of dollars per seat. I found it all obscene, and I boycotted the movie. I did follow the reviews and was heartened when it was reviewed poorly, but then disheartened when it still made another fortune for Lucas.Now three years later, I've decided to see ""Episode Two"" before it leaves the theaters. But I can't do that until I view ""Episode 1"" to get straight with the plot elements. So, I rented ""Episode 1"". . .I couldn't believe my eyes. It's even worse than I hoped. Actually, it's not bad at all, and is rather entertaining. But when compared against the original three Star Wars movies, it doesn't hold a candle. Nothing in ""Episode 1"" is original, it's all been done before in the earlier trilogy, and done much, much better. It's like a Star Wars movie, only drained of drama, suspense and originality.  What's left is a slick, high-tech, science fiction 'kids' movie. That's all.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Where it all began.,"The story of the Skywalker saga begins in this film, and it build very good the mythology of the saga. In my opinion, the correct order to watch the Star Wars films is to start with the phantom menace. Star Wars is undoubtedly my favorite sci-fi franchise of all time. Dis movie is a very solid beginning to the history of Star Wars. We get to see Anakin's origin to become a Jedi. To talk about the perfect pace of the movie, for the perfect ratio between exposition, battle scenes and emotional scenes, for the amazing choreographies for the lightsabers. All great in this film. By the way, Jar Jar Binks is a complete misunderstanding character, he's good.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Honestly better the second time around,"This movie is a classic example of how we can allow the media to persuade our way of thinking. I liked this movie a lot when I saw it in the theaters, but after review after review panning it, my memory become colored by them.I just recently got the special edition on VHS (widescreen is really the only way to experience these movies) and watched it twice. I loved it even more! One of the best parts is now I can actually understand Jar Jar Binks and Trade Federation characters. Originally their accents were just too thick to be comprehensible.I'm sure there are others that feel as I do, so go ahead, watch it again and see if you can find more to the movie this time around, I know I did.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace (1999) *,"(Possible Spoiler)I'm not a die-hard STAR WARS fan by any means, yet I recognize the original 1977 adventure as a very good throwback to the old time adventure serials, on which it was based. As of this writing I'm eager to familiarize myself with these movies in preparation for the newly released REVENGE OF THE SITH. I wanted to at least rent THE PHANTOM MENACE and ATTACK OF THE CLONES to get some sort of perspective.I actually saw PHANTOM MENACE upon its release in 1999; it wasn't very good to me then and I'm sorry to say that my home viewing of it for the second time last night appealed to me even less. I don't feel too clueless, as I'm aware that even many STAR WARS devotees also were disappointed with this one. It's just a chaotic mess, not very decipherable, and far too juvenile. To make matters even less bearable, some of the performers were poorly chosen. Chief on the list is little inexperienced Jake Lloyd, who is completely non-convincing as the one who'd become Darth Vader, as we all know. He doesn't come across as the ""wiz kid"" or ""potentially dangerous"" presence we keep hearing about from Liam Neeson's character. Lucas should have gone with the talented Haley Joel Osment (THE SIXTH SENSE)... he really could have pulled this part off. Natalie Portman is absolutely horrid as she plays the disinterested queen who slips in and out of her noble delivery, depending on whether or not she's in her makeup at any given moment. Only Denise Richards could have been less effective (maybe).The CGI effects are way too much, and often times I felt like I was watching an old Looney Toons comedy; hordes of silly-looking creatures, making funnies and acting all stupid. Which leads us to the irritating Jar-Jar Binks -- it was a disaster having this annoying character in the film. A good (I mean, bad) example of where these cartoony creatures really overstayed their welcome was during the popular ""pod race,"" which was more mind-numbing than exciting. I couldn't make heads or tails out of it, and I couldn't wait until it ended.Thank heavens for Liam Neeson and Ewan McGregor. On the plus side (and the only real thing this chapter has going for it), Neeson is magnificent in his role as the Jedi Master who has taught young Obi-Wan (another fine performance from McGregor) the ways of the Jedi. They make a perfect team, and it's a shame they were wasted in this muddled mess of a movie. I should mention that I thought Darth Maul made for a pretty good villain, but he was sadly under-used. Oh, yes - and the whole thing felt (surprise!) about 45 minutes too long. Oh well. Every series is entitled to have its turkey. Now I move on to EPISODE II... * out of ****",2.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Worst Episode Ever,"The Star Wars Trilogy is one of the most remarkable achievements in film history. I waited impatiently year after year for the prequel to our beloved story.

I would go see a sequal to Anaconda before I saw the next Star Wars.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Has potential but the execution is very sloppy,The phantom menace is a very interesting movie in my opinion because I do understand the hate behind it but it's not as bad as people say it is. The cast is good for the most part but there is a few members of the cast that are just awful and not great for example young Anakin his casting choice was just awful in every way. The most of the characters are good but as I said previously young Anakin is awful and jar jar binks is just an awful character In all senses of the word. There is some good scenes in this movie from the pod racing scene to the ending fight with death maul. The music is always good by John williams. But onto the things I don't like about. Like I said jar jar binks and Anakin are terrible characters in this movie jar jar is just so annoying and Anakin is just a brat throughout the whole movie he doesn't listen to what he is told to do. The structure of the movie is awful to don't get me wrong the story in this movie is great but the execution is just so sloppy and bad. The pacing in this movie is terrible also like it's all over the place. The villain in darth maul is very weak in my opinion don't get me wrong he is really cool but when you look into his character development there really isn't any at all which just sucks because he is a great villain In concept but his execution is just bad. Overall the phantom menace is just very mediocre yes it has its pros but the cons sadly outweigh them.,6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Lucas can do better than this!,"I remember seeing Star Wars at age five. I was addicted to Star Wars. I was wondering how The Phantom Menace was going to do. I thought that it was going to be a triumph like the other three, but I was proven wrong. It was an o.k. movie, but the story itself was weak. It filled some of the details, but not all. Also Lucas did a mistake in that movie. In The Empire Strikes Back, Obi-wan says to Luke, ""Go to the Degobay system. There you will find Yoda who TRAINED ME!"" Master Yoda was the master of Obi-wan, not Qui-gon Jinn, but I have to admit that if it wasn't from Liam Nelson for being in this film, the film would have crumpled. The effects were phenomenal, there was more humor, and a few good action sequences. That was another problem with the film, there was only two real good action sequences, which were the podrace and the battle at the end including the duel with lightsabers, which I thought was awesome, because in the other 3 films, there wasn't much into the duels, except a flip in Episode VI by Luke Skywalker to dodge a blow taht would have cut him in two halves. Another problem was how hokey and corny the film was with some of the creatures including the flying blue thing at the shop, and Sebulba, the podracer, nemesis of Anakin. The other problem with the film was that the dark jedi, Maul was not much of a character. To me, he was an object. You could not hate him or like him, and he didn't talk except five lines, and what was with the horns on his head? He looked like the devil! However, I do love the music of the great duel at the end, which increased the suspense in your body. I give this film a 7 out of 10. Lucas could do better than this. He needs to use more interesting ideas.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
It's a Children's Movie,"I consider The Phantom Menace to be the second worst film in the series. It's not a horrible film by any means, but you must be prepared for one particular letdown: this film doesn't seem to have been made for the aged fans of the original trilogy. Instead, it appeals mostly to small children and die-hard fans of the saga. For that, I give this film praise; it is a very decent children's movie. Granted, it's nothing up against the likes of The Secret of Nimh, The Brave Little Toaster, or even The Incredibles and other recent Pixar films, but most boys who were under the age of ten when The Phantom Menace was released thought Anakin Skywalker was nothing short of awesome.For seasoned veterans like myself, however, the childish humor really falls short. The combination of Jake Lloyd as Anakin and Jar Jar Binks almost completely ruined it for me, and I feel as though I have to block those characters out in my mind to enjoy the film. Anakin's one-liners during the assault on the droid control ship sounded like the Ninja Turtles in the early 90s. Furthermore, between him and Jar Jar, the seemingly epic battles were won completely by accident. No such travesty existed in the original trilogy, and furthermore, it diminishes the heroism of both characters. Essentially, the only true hero of the film is Obi-Wan Kenobe, and for the entirety of the film he is mostly kept in the background as a babysitter for the queen, whose acting in this film resembles that of a crash test dummy.My last gripes about this film are mostly visual problems. The CGI really dominates this movie. I personally found it more charming when costumes ruled Hollywood. It's just that many of the CGI stunts are so ludicrous and overexaggerated, making this more resemblant of a multi-million-dollar cartoon than a Star Wars film.On the good side, there are many positive aspects of this film. The story, for one thing, is great for the saga. Focusing on a number of things, including Palpatine's rise to power, Obi-Wan's last days of training, Anakin's incredible skills as an engineer, and the rebirth of the Sith after a long time of peace. The dialog is even fairly decent, so long as Jar Jar, Anakin, and Queen Amidala have nothing to say.I found Qui-Gon Jinn (sp?) to be the most likable character. In the entire prequel trilogy, in fact, he has more lines of wisdom than even Yoda (whose puppet actually looked worse in this film than it did in The Empire Strikes Back).Darth Maul was a great villain. His mystique was what kept me interested in him--sometimes it really is better to only show the tip of the iceberg. A lot of people complain that he was underdeveloped, but, honestly, I like it much better that way for characters like him. In addition, his lightsaber battle against Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan is my favorite lightsaber battle in the entire series.While Episode I definitely did not live up to the hype or the original trilogy, it was a decent addition to the saga. 6/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Needlessly childish and sadly shallow, but still imaginative and entertaining","I was 12 years old in 1999 when the ""Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace"" was released. So, in many ways, I was at the perfect age for this movie – squarely in the crosshairs of the marketing's target demographic. I had been harvested, in a way, since my true love of the original trilogy developed two years prior, when the films were re-released between January and March of 1997. I was part of the excited up-and-coming generation of ""Star Wars"" fans who couldn't wait for history to be made with ""Episode I.""When you're 12, just about any movie you're excited about is ""awesome,"" so I came out of the theater with a big stupid grin on my face. I even kept the ticket stub (it's the oldest one I still have). I saw it again, I bought the LEGO sets and it was probably the first DVD I ever watched.Much time had passed before I realized how much of a letdown the film was for most fans compared to its insurmountable hype. Eventually I came to the conclusion (on my own) that the prequels were not on the same level as the original trilogy and accepted that ""Episode I"" was the worst of the bunch, despite loving the movie as a pre-teen.But in the last 10-plus years since I'd seen ""The Phantom Menace,"" one question lingered: What would I think of it now?I had to know if maturity (and watching hundreds of great, classic films and writing about them critically) would reveal ""The Phantom Menace"" to be the joke so many said it was, or if nostalgia would color my view and prevent me from seeing it objectively. Then there was the third possibility: could I see it objectively, and like it?I did find it a little difficult to forget the ways in which ""The Phantom Menace"" was pioneering. The use of CGI was groundbreaking at the time. The lightsaber fight choreography was unlike anything we'd seen in the original films. Most of all, I was surprised to see how well the podracing scene held up. It is far and away the film's most masterful sequence, even though it's a diversion and a way to inject something exciting into the film's second act.Narratively, ""The Phantom Menace"" is a total mess. The conflict between the Trade Federation and Naboo might make total sense in Lucas' head, but is utterly confusing and in no way plays into the entertainment value of the film. Every component of the story serves to set the stage for the rest of the trilogy. Really focus on the plot when you watch and you can see how desperately he tries to connect and tweak ""The Phantom Menace"" to fit this bigger agenda and throws in imaginative components just to give the movie something to be about on its own.In that context, ""The Phantom Menace"" amounts to first pawn moving forward in the Sith's evil scheme, whereas the other two prequels actually play out the chess game. Give it a double-sided lightsaber and a podracing sequence, but it's still just a pawn making the first move.The controversy Jar Jar Binks caused is warranted. He's a poor version of a Looney Tunes character who is both unintelligible and seemingly a racist stereotype of Afro-Caribbean peoples. He adds no value to the story and his ""clumsy buffoon who becomes a hero purely on accident"" routine will entertain no one but the smallest of children. ""Childish,"" in fact, is definitely an adjective that can be fairly leveraged against ""The Phantom Menace."" There is no reason to set ""Episode I"" when Anakin Skywalker is a kid except to appeal to kids. He could've at least been a reckless teenager sort, enough that we could see some shades of the troubled soul who will be tempted by the Dark Side.Lucas' flaws as a writer really stand out in ""Phantom Menace,"" but not necessarily to the point that the film is garbage. He's an absolute master of imagination and imagination-fueled storytelling, and what he does with the camera keeps viewers engaged and invested in the outcome. That much is present in ""Episode I."" What he struggles with, at least in these prequels, is character-driven storytelling. He seems to have a checklist for the plot in terms of what needs to happen, but he doesn't really think about who these characters are and what they want. They are as empty as the action figures he means to so desperately sell. And the supporting characters? Forget about it.As much as you can break it apart, however, ""The Phantom Menace"" is not a disgrace to ""Star Wars."" Imagination counts for something, and to be honest, that's half of what ""A New Hope"" thrived upon when it became a pop-culture sensation nearly 40 years ago. ""The Phantom Menace"" builds tremendously on ""Star Wars"" lore even if it does so with a degree of childishness. It is also a movie that understands how to entertain in audience when it matters most, and that, in essence, is the strength of the entire ""Star Wars"" saga.~Steven CThanks for reading!

Breathtaking visuals make this a must see!,"Forget all the negative hype! Many were expecting another Star Wars or ROTJ with a wise-cracking Han Solo character playing off a beautiful princess. Episode 1 is about style and visuals. Lucas sacrificed character development and intelligent character interplay with amazing visuals that will blow you away! I'll take the hyperspeed Pod racing scene over Solo/Lea flirting any day.This movie breaks new ground. Some die-hards complained about the CGI. This movie has the best CGI to date. The final battle scenes, played in three arenas were brilliant! So many things are happening visually in each shot that you HAVE to see the film more than once just to appreciate the effects. Buy this movie now. So what if it is not DVD. So what if you're going to end up buying the DVD in six years again anyway. Episode one is a true masterpiece of visuals and epic action sequences.

There's always a bigger fish.,"Now this review can go two ways, one- compared to the first trilogy this movie is a disappointment, or two- on it's own this movie is sub par overall. I guess the best way to tackle this piece is a few pros and cons. Looking at pros of this movie is the visual beauty and amazing fights that take place. I really loved how incredible the Battle droids looked and the epic ending leaves you with a sense of awe. Darth Maul is so cool too, a silent behemoth of power with two, count them two blades. Plus podracing is incredibly entertaining to emerge yourself in. Now the cons, the script isn't the greatest and the pacing of the movie is fairly slow. Some parts of the acting was a little spotty and can be confusing from time to time. I don't wish to look at the cons of this movie simply because it is Star Wars and it is something I have loved sense I was a kid but there are some that are just to distracting for words, hint hint. As I grew up believe me I did enjoy this move a lot but looking back at it, it isn't as great as I remember, and I will refrain from Lucas's so called comic relief Jar Jar.Stand-alone it isn't to bad a movie, probably gaining a 7.5 or higher from me rating wise, but this is the legend. I give it a 7 overall. ""Remember: Your focus determines your reality."" -Qui-Gon Jinn",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Millions of dollars for a script written by a 6 year old,"Am I the only person who watched this movie and wasn't buffaloed by the great special effects.  I am a huge Star Wars fan, but man this movie really sucked.  Sure the scenery, costumes, and special effects were all top notched and they really did give the viewer the feel of the stars wars movie's, but the acting and story are amazingly bad.  I have watched the movie several times, and I still don't understand why the trade federation (a group of chinese toad people) feel the need to invade the peaceful planet of Naboo.  Well they do attack and the princess of Naboo must esacpe with two jedi.  They meet up with some uncharismatic little kid (anakin skywalker, who is like 7 in this movie, and eventually gets Natalie Portman-the princess pregnant with luke and leia, don't pay attention to the fact Natalie Portman is 18 in this movie, they are replacing the actor of anakin in stars wars episode 2 with an older kid, why not have the foresight for this in the first place)  The movie is just plain stupid.  The robots look weak and flimsy, and they stutter.  The spaceships have lost all of the charm and individuality compared to the first three movies.  The end is so anti-climatic.  This trade federation sends in a horde of robot troops to conquer the planet.  The gungans (a native race of naboo) accidentally stumble around and blow up a lot of robots, but the ultimate slap in the face is when the seven year old Anakin, stumbles upon a spaceship, accidently turns in on, unwittingly flys into space and it just so happens that all the robots on the planet (thousands upon thousands) are controlled by one master ship, and little Anakin accidently fires a missile and coincidentally blows up the master ship.

Disappointment is an understatement.,"This is the film that Lucas proclaims as his original vision for the original Star Wars.  What a load of rubbish.  The original Star Wars, (or now called Episode IV: Star Wars: A New Hope) is much better.I actually watched this film in 1999 in the cinema, and I thought it was barely passable back then.  I found it irritating, annoying and no real flow.But I didn't really want to write a review of the film until I had saw the original trilogy - I was one of those rare people who hadn't seen the trilogy and wanted to make a fair, balanced judgement of this film.  After seeing the trilogy on video, I can honestly say that this is a complete mess, a complete disappointment and an excuse for Lucas to turn his ""vision"" into a money-making scheme, where the ""force"" - once something mystical, ""something all around us"" and spirtual is now turned into a marketing tagline explained away by chemicals known only as midichlorians.The premise of this is the fact that two Jedi ambassadors are sent to achieve peace from the invading, and so obvious Japanese styled alien invaders.  But of course, they realise its a trap and soon try to rescue the princess or whatever and soon take out the alien invaders which leave Senator Palpatine in control, thus making the situation much worse than it originally was.So, okay the idea and plot isn't bad - every legend needs a first step, and indeed this is it.  I am not complaining about that, what I am complaining about is the sheer horridness of this film.For example, Jar Jar is just a pain in the CGI ass.  What was his role in the film?  Did he have a purpose other than to sell toys?  Of course not, Lucas sold out to toy makers.  The same could be argued about the pod racing - it has no real purpose in the film.The CGI is very well handled, well except for close-ups of Jar Jar and Obi-Wan Kenobi (MacGregor) and the action sequences seem fine until the end where Lucas strives to impose a sense of an ""adrenaline rush"" to viewers, but ends up ruining the exceptionally cherographed lightsaber fight sequence.Anakin is also a problem, typecast as a nine year old kid who says ""Golly"" and ""Uh Oh"" and stuff.  Darth Vader doesn't say stuff like that.  The horridness of Anakin's character is eptiomized when he ""accidently"" blows up a younger version of the death star in a fighter jet.  Oh boy, this is just plain bad.Well, Lucas says that this film isn't made for the trilogy fans and says that this is a kids film.  What hogwash, if it were, why would the original trilogy have a darkness style to them?Overall this is a disappointment, not only to a sci-fi fan, but to star wars fans.  Personally I enjoyed Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon - which is what this film (indeed the whole trilogy, or the whole sextant) should feel and be like.My overall view is that this film can only be summarized as being disappointing...but even that is an understatement.Overall: 3/10.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
A new trilogy sixteen years later.,"George Lucas went all ""oooooh ahhhh"" with updated CGI capabilities but neglected the ""heart"" of storytelling. I've watched this film several times over the years and I still feel the same criticisms. How he ever thought adding this level of boring politics to the story was good for it just shows how out of touch he was. It's like all's he had were ""yes men"" around him, because not only did they not dissuade him from the politics problem, but they let him go ape sht with CGI with its anti-septic level of cleanliness and a whole race of Jar Jar Binks. Focused so much on this he was that he neglected to direct human actors which all come off as wooden as a troop of Keanu Reeves. Youngling Anakin Skywalker on the other hand, all of what 10 yrs old, can do no wrong - expert racer, strong with the Force he knows nothing of, then destroys a huge space warship by accident.

A Great beginning to a six year affair . . .,"One of the things that people say hurt this movie is the lack of a rogue-ish character ala Han Solo. True, but if there were a Han like character in the movie, people would have bitched about lucas not being creative anymore and critics would have reemed him for rehashing the same formula over again. Many people complain about the acting, saying no one acted well. But if you examine the originals, you'll see similar acting. Star Wars isn't about acting, it's about being a kid. It's about getting that warm fuzzy feeling in your stomach when the Fox Fanfare/Lucasfilm logos shine on the screen. It's about having fun. None of the movies are meant to be thinking movies.

"Okay, but not worth the hype","George Lucas certainly deserves credit for changing the way movies look, but it seems he's forgotten some things as a storyteller.  The original STAR WARS, as you may remember, was culled together from a whole bunch of sources; people today keep trumpeting Joseph Campbell as the primary influence, but let's not forget Flash Gordon serials, Kurosawa films(particularly THE HIDDEN FORTRESS), and THE THIEF OF BAGHDAD), not to mention the science fiction/fantasy novels like the FOUNDATION trilogy and THE LORD OF THE RINGS trilogy.  I had some problems with the first STAR WARS, but its grab bag of influences helped lend it an air of unprententiousness that was cheering.  And, of course, when things got too leaden, there was Harrison Ford as Han Solo to lighten things up.Now we have the new one.  Like the first three, this has awesome special effects, and the look is incredible.  And the action scenes are quite good. But the dialogue is incredibly wooden(it brings to mind what Ford said to Lucas during the first one, ""You can write this s--t, George, but you sure can't say it""), and all the actors deliver it in a stilted matter(with exceptions I'll get to later).  In the first one, since I never knew who Ford, Carrie Fisher, or Mark Hamill were before I saw it(or even Alec Guinness), it didn't seem so bad, because they had a fresh, callow look to them, and they at least seemed to believe what they were saying.  But you've got some great actors here; Liam Neeson, Ewan McGregor, Samuel L. Jackson, and Natalie Portman, and they're all hamstrung by the dialogue.  Also, they all look like they'd rather be somewhere else.  Portman at least has moments when she's not dressed up like something out of a horror movie, but those are few.  The only one who escapes this trap is Jake Lloyd as the young Anakin Skywalker.  He at least acts like a kid, but there's no hint of him becoming Darth Vader in the future.  Perhaps that will come out next time.In addition, the story is somewhat confusing at times, and seems misplaced in movie like this(taxes?).  Finally, there's the matter of Jar Jar Binks and some of the other aliens.  Unlike many, I liked the Ewoks in Jedi, but Jar Jar Binks brought back memories of Stepin Fetchit and Butterfly McQueen, and if the aliens Senator Palpatine(Ian McDirmarid does a good job) enlists to do his dirty work were intended to show off Lucas' Kurosawa influence, they instead come off as Charlie Chan stereotypes.  Only Darth Maul seems free from this, but they give him a motive of revenge without explaining it.Then again, with all the hype, it's hard to give a really objective opinion here.  I didn't walk out unhappy, but it's certainly not worth all the hype.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Proof of the times--and sad times at that,"This piece fails on many levels. The acting alone should be enough to alert viewers that George Lucas no longer cares about making movies. This piece is one long SpFX reel, and even these fail to satisfy. The CGI FX seem surprisingly thin and immaterial (a history of the filmmaking process)--who really cares that either Gungans or 'droids get there just desserts. Let's be honest with ourselves. Everything aside from the central characters are mere scenery that serve no purpose but to distract the audiences from the live actors' bad performances. Jar-Jar Binks manages to flop his way into the center of attention in scenes where we SHOULD be watching the actors in order to be drawn into the progression of the plot. Shame on you, George Lucas. You have abandoned the wonderful stories, mythology, and adventure of the Star Wars Trilogy in order to indulge yourself and fill your pockets.To be fair, the pod race is a BRILLIANT piece of filming.

The characters are one dimensional, the action is 'cartoonlike', the love interest is totally unconvincing and the comedy relief is completely out of place and childish.There isn't really much plot, apart from setting up the basis for episodes 2 and 3. Most of the film is padding and meaningless set-pieces. Even the much famed 'race' has been totally over-hyped.And, worse of all, the baddies are not developed enough for us to to really hate them. In fact, I felt more dislike for the 'heroes'.I realise it just wasn't possible to create a film with the sort of impact that the original 'Star Wars' had but surely, with the money available to them, they could have found a writer who could have delivered a good story and some believable dialogue.Totally lacking in any charm or magic.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"An engrossing, but somewhat disappointing film","I was fortunate enough to get to see this at a preview screening this weekend, and I was, overall, rather impressed.  Let me start this off by saying that, yes, I was inevitably a little disappointed having waited 16 years to see the movie, but despite that it still delivers... for the most part.The special effects and 6.1 channel Dolby Digital Sound were incredible, creating a rich, detailed, world for George to play with.  I commend ILM for their rendition of the pod race, audience members were literally ducking their heads and turning side to side with the pods.  That said, while the Star Wars universe is as viscerally sumptuous as ever (perhaps more so), a bit of the heart seems to have gone out of it.  At times, the special effects are indulgently over-used, and seem to overshadow character development, drama, and depth.  The score, however, is magnificent; predominantly filled with all new material, vestiges of the all too familiar themes remain lingering in the background to remind us all that this is, after all, Star Wars. I think everybody in the theater felt chills go go down their spines when bars from Luke and the Emperor's Themes were played, they are potent reminders of what this series is all about and portents of the tragedy that awaits in episodes II and III.The performances?  Neeson seemed perfectly cast as the noble Jedi who is the guardian of peace and justice, his sublime wisdom coupled with McGregor's passion gave the film a heart and soul that seems simultaneously fresh and familiar.  Lloyd shows great potential (which is fitting, given his character), and, while lacking the polish of the more experienced actors, delivers as well as can be expected.  Natalie Portman does adequately, acting a bit like Fisher in the first film, minus the spunk. Jackson and Oz are superb in their, unfortunately, very small parts (Jackson appears in all of three scenes and Yoda's only in 4).  Ian McDiarmid's Palpatine is nearly perfect - subtle, Machiavellian, and manipulative - and though he's often in the shadows, his Iago-like presence is perpetually felt.  The only other performance that is really worth mentioning is Ahmed Best's Jar Jar Binks (and, yes, he only contributes the voice, so he doesn't deserve all the blame), who is completely ingratiating and frustrating.  The character was a hit with the kids in the audience, but I was fervently hoping that Qui-Gon would ""accidentally"" eliminate him from the film entirely.  Jar-Jar does to this film what the Ewoks did to Jedi, but far more thoroughly than they did, kiddify it.  He draws the viewer's attention away from where it belongs, and serves only as a target for mundane slapstick humor and a venue for ridiculous antics which detract from the story.As to the story itself, it is original and often riveting, but drags a bit in the beginning.  The stories have always been the films' strong suits, and this one is replete with the allegory, mythology, and symbolism that we've all come to know and love from these films.  As with Neeson's performance, the spiritual quest is given a sublimely subtle twist, but far too little is made of it (presumably this gap will be filled by the next two). The atmosphere is engrossing and well fleshed out, and the viewer gets the vivid impression that this is a real world with something always going on behind the scenes or just beyond your peripheral vision, which adds enormously to the experience.Of course, the reason the film works as well as it does is because we already know the universe and even some of the characters.  Young Anakin hasn't yet turned to the Dark Side, and so his potential, humanity, and Christ like nature are constantly emphasized - but everyone there knew who Darth Vader was.  It is for exactly this reason that we are almost moved to tears when we see the sacrifices made for this innocent savior of the Jedi whom the audience knows will become Dark Lord of the sith and hunt down (with the help of a seemingly innocuous senator named Palpatine) virtually every other Jedi shown in the film.  Williams score complements these scenes nicely, the elegiac undertones emphasizing the sheer tragedy of it all (he plays bars from Luke's theme just as Anakin begins his odyssey).The scope of the film is just as epic as its predecessors' but most of it happens off screen (for example, we never see exactly how Palpatine maneuvers the Senate, but we know that he does it), and for this reason it seems just a little bit more static and impersonal.  When Neeson and McGregor are together, there's a chemistry between them that works and we begin to probe the depths of this Bushido-like Jedi code, but it seems to happen far too rarely.This film is similar to the Godfather part III in that there is a fascinating paradox at work:  the film wouldn't work well at all without the context provided by the other films, but it is, almost unfairly, compared to the other masterpieces and is, thus, mildly disappointing and unfulfilling. The film does contain a rousing score (Williams did a masterful job), rich tapestry, complex story, stark characterizations (in most cases), familiar undertones, and all new faces; yet something seems to be missing.  Perhaps it's because The Phantom Menace feels primarily like a setup for the next two films.  Maybe that will make them all the more absorbing and intelligent, and will make this film look better in hindsight.  Perhaps it's because the film seems lacking in the spiritual and emotional depth the original Trilogy is known for.  Or perhaps it's just that my expectations were high.  Regardless, the film is worth seeing  and will hopefully serve as a poignant backdrop for the darker, deeper, and more tragic sequels that most Star Wars fans and film buffs are hoping for.The Force is with Lucas, it just seems to have faded a tad with time. 7.5/10 or ***",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Jar to the Jar to Bang Da Dang Diggy Diggy,"A long, long time ago, in a city far away, I walked into a crowded theater to watch the beginning of the first chapter. Star Wars nerd was I. Ready to be completed and fulfilled, hoping I wasn't going to die before the final movie was projected into my frontal lobe and the saga was finally completed.Then... say hello to Jar Jark motherf***ing Binks. Okay, I know that the criticism of Jar Jar has been overdone and in October of 2008 their is little else to say about the character most crucified this millennium by pop culture. Maybe he was part of the whole racist thing along with the Trade Federation Asians (Choy-pee-songy!).Kids aren't great actors so Lil' Anakin Skywalker comes off as unrealistic and rushed. ""I'm a great fighter pilot!!!"" Riiiiight.... you're freaking nine years old, bro, reeeelax...Now that it's out of the way, and realizing this movie was meant for kids, I need to say that Liam Niesson was made to play a Jedi. Natalie Portman as Amadala is another bright spot but it also messes with me because she's playing the hottest fourteen year old I've seen in a movie since Dominique Swain wore the Lolita mantle. Early signs a ridiculous love triangle with Anakin and Obi-Wan are set down when Anakin's a freaking nine-year old. I love it.Darth Maul was a pretty awesome concept of a character if he only was in the movie more than about fourteen minutes. The evil element was thrown so far in the background that it sort lowered the fear factor towards the whole ""Sith Lord Comeback"" angle which could have been way better.Damn, the more I talk about this movie the more I realize it could be a rated a ten so easily but the tying of loose ends and the attempt at making it kid friendly really hampered it. Saying that, though, the movie looks so beautiful and to quote Kevin Smith (through a cartoon character lawyer in Clerks: Uncensored) ""Objection, your honor. The pod races were pretty cool."" How long before a bright edgy film maker takes it upon himself to remake this one. Where's Richard Donner when he's needed? Okay, it gets a seven because it's freaking Star Wars and that's the lowest score I could possibly muster but in the Star Wars scale it's a one. So I have to live with watching this one every time I cycle through George Lucas' masterpiece in chronological order.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Generally Enjoyable, Highlighted By Pod Race; A Tip - Use Subtitles","I believe George Lucas said he was inspired by the chariot race in the 1959 epic Ben-Hur, and thought of it often when he staged the big pod race scene in this movie.So, when I watched the film again the other day, the third or fourth time I've seen it, I kept looking for comparisons. Well, suffice to say nothing will surpass that chariot race, which had no benefit of any special-effects while this was almost all computer-generated. Nevertheless, the pod race in here was a lot of fun to watch, had excellent surround sound, was exciting and the highlight of the film. Oddly, in this movie instead of a man you have a small boy as the good guy- driver, so to speak. Young Jake Lloyd who plays ""Anakin Skywalker."" He's the key character in this Star Wars saga, the boy who later becomes the father to Luke Skywalker and winds up being revealed as Darth Vader. But....this is long before thatThis movie, the first Star Wars movie after a long hiatus (16-years) disappointed a lot of fans but I thought it was entertaining overall. My main complaint was trying to understand ""Jar Jar Binks,"" but on the DVD I can use English subtitles and thus understand all the strange things he says with his Caribbean accent. It makes the movie more enjoyable and I strongly recommend doing that.As usual, there is a ton of astounding visuals in here, all kinds of strange characters and excellent ""effects."" Yes, the action gets hokey in spots, especially near the end, but what modern-day action film doesn't?Liam Neeson makes for a solid male hero and Natalie Portman is a appealing as Queen (Padme) Amidala. Lloyd is no Haley Joel Osment, but what can you do? At least his character wasn't some brat, and he's tolerable. He has acted in much since then, although I saw him in a nice movie called ""Madison,"" with Jim Caviezel.People who are really ""into"" this Star Wars saga, and take it seriously, were, as mentioned generally let down with this movie. I guess they expected a lot more after waiting so long for the next installment. I just watch it for the enjoyment of an escapist film and as someone who usually enjoys good visuals. I repeat: put on the ""English subtitles."" That helped a lot, believe me.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Not brilliant, but an overall satisfactory addition to Star Wars","Let me start off by saying that this movie was R-O-B-B-E-D at the Academy Awards. No nominations for Best Costumes, Best Makeup, or Best Art Direction is downright stupid. Aesthetically, this film was downright beautiful. I really honor George Lucas for realizing a time when The Republic was at its prime, and it was basically a golden age for the galaxy. The special effects are also fantastic and, in my opinion, was the first really big visual effects film that broke down the door for other FX films like LOTR. Truly brilliant.Writing wise, I felt the film was kind of flat and uninspired, if you will. The plot was almost incoherent (even now I don't know what the film is exactly about) and the story with the Trade Federation is unnecessarily complicated. The dialog is probably the worst of the six (but AOTC had some bad lines). ""Are you an angel?"" If you compare it to the original trilogy, dialog like that doesn't seem right and comes off sort of awkward. However, I will give George Lucas credit for bringing attention in very subtle ways to Palpatine and his intentions. Seeing him rise to power is a really neat tie-in to the original trilogy.Acting wise, the movie isn't all too spectacular either. Liam Neesan does his best to keep the movie flowing, and for the most part, he does pretty well. He didn't really have that great of a script to work with. Ewan McGregor wasn't given that great of a part, but it's obvious that his time to shine came in the next two episodes. Pernilla August does a wonderful job of playing the mother part, and it's a shame that they gave her such a small role. Jake Lloyd, to put it very very kindly, was stilted. He tried, I know, but I can't help but roll my eyes when ever I hear ""Yipee!"". On the other hand, it's hard to hold your own when you have a bad script to work with. Ray Park is the best performance of the film, even though he delivers the fewest lines. His intensity and the way he digs in to the role makes you unable to take your eyes off of him whenever he's on screen. They couldn't have made a better cast choice.I haven't said much positive about the movie, but I will say now that the action in this film is unparalleled. Almost instantly the excitement grabs a hold of you and keeps you wanting more. Some of the best sequences, such as the stunning three-person lightsaber duel and the masterfully executed podrace scene, hold their own against the best action of the saga, and even manage to surpass some. George Lucas did a marvelous job of planning these scenes, and even though the film may have been panned, it is undeniable that these sequences influenced action films of the coming years. Action in one word: breathtaking.If there was another nit-pick I could make, it would be how this film really looks nothing like the original films. It's a beautifully shot and decorated movie, I know, but I can't help but think ""How did it change so fast in 30 years? Why has everything gone to crap?"" Oh, and don't even get me started on that Yoda! It's not that he's a puppet, but that he looks NOTHING like he did in the other films! I really hope George fixes this in the future. And I don't think I need to talk about the Gungans. It's been beaten to death and I personally didn't mind Jar Jar as much as everyone else did.That being said, this movie was by no means the piece of crap mess that people originally said. I thought it was a fun, epic, visually amazing, yet emotionally flat addition to the Star Wars saga. Yes, it was a bit disappointing and yes, it is the worst of the Star Wars films, but it's still a non-stop thrill ride that is well worth watching and is actually better once you've seen the other five films.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Stunning effects and the SOUND, man this stuff is the best","I saw this movie in the theaters 2 times, just to hear the sound one more time. The sound in this movie is truly amazing. If you haven't seen this movie yet, be sure to watch it in a THX environment, you won't be disappointed. The picture quality is also very good, not a finger to put on anything. I would have given the movie 10 out of 10 but there was a few minor things that bothered me. The movie gets a bit too emotional (comparing with the first 3 episodes), not that emotional is bad, but it seems sort of fake to me. Though the thing that bothered me the most, was this creature called Jar Jar Binks. He should have been a comic sidekick, but it is as if he just becomes more and more annoying, the more you watch him instead of him being funny.

This movie?  Matinee all the way.  Or the dollar theatre.,"Ghost of a FilmThis movie?  Matinee all the way.  Or the dollar theatre.MY TWO CENTS REVIEWI'm sorry, but the movie was weak.  I forced myself to watch it with fresh, untainted eyes.  The plot was confusing and hard to follow, the characters were poorly developed, and the humor was forced and truly, truly unfunny.The ScriptWeak.  Bad plotting and dialogue .  The characters are hopping from planet to planet seemingly willy-nilly and the side trip to Tatooine, aside from the need to get Anakin into the story somehow, was long (although, thank GOD for the Pod Race!).  There were some major holes and unexplained things in the film (the biggest being, if Tatooine is ""Outer Rim,"" too far out to be policed concerning the Republic's anti-slavery policies, then why is it on the way between Naboo and Coruscant (at the center of the system?)).I had basic issues:  Why would this character do this?  What's the motivation?  Who's the villain?  Darth Maul?  The Emperor?  Palpatine? The Japanese Aliens?  Who's the hero?  Qui-Jonn?  Anakin?  Queen Amidala?  The writing, the backbone of any movie, and the hallmark of any SW movie, was lacking in the extreme in some very basic things that even I-by no means a good fiction writer-could spot a mile away.The CharacterizationNo one was well developed at all.  Qui-Gonn and Obi-Wan are the heroes, but they hardly do anything until the lightsaber duel at the end.  Anakin is cute, but all of his achievements are pre-ordained; of course he has to survive:  he's not even childbearing age yet.  And it's hard to root for this cute kid when you know that in 30 or so years, he'll be crushing some guys windpipe with his mind.Probably the worst mistake was the sparse use of Darth Maul!  From what I understand, the actor, Ray Park does all of the training for the lightsaber fight scenes, and it showed in that sequence at the end.  It will take your breath away.  Whereas the Vader/Skywalker fights were power versus agility, these were ballets of death with all of the backflips and feints that accompany such a deadly dance.  It was beautiful to watch.Then we have the creatures.The damned creatures.Far, far too much attention is paid to them.  You can feel the joy and wonder the filmmakers had in creating these things because they are on screen TOO DAMN LONG.  Too bad that joy and wonder wasn't infused into the script.In a way, I understand:  hundreds of FX shots, you need to focus on them since you're spending all of that money, right?  Well, all it did was steal character development time from everyone else and just kick you out of the story even further:  little hat droids hopping around, the droid army slowly unfolding from its rack, Watto doing his ""Greek merchant"" think with Qui-Gonn, the Japanese Aliens speaking without moving their lips.  And Jar-Jar.Damned Jar-Jar.My hatred of this character knows no bounds.  It's as if someone said ""Hey, the guys computer animated, who cares what he says?!  Whooooo!""). Chewbacca, who you couldn't understand, was funnier than this floppy-eared freak.  I understand that there has to be a ""toy-ready"" character for the film, but, man, this thing was a-friggin'-'nnoying!  I won't rant anymore, but God in Heaven, he was painful to watch.In all, the creatures were distracting.  As opposed to just treating them like ordinary characters, the camera stays on them for far, far too long, and for no reason other than to show off the technical wizardry.  If that's why people came to see a movie, though, Godzilla would have made more money.The ActingAll-in-all pretty solid.  Some friends of mine didn't like Jake Lloyd, but I thought the kid did OK; his lines were poorly written, but what could he do about that?  Ray Park was friggin' great and was onscreen for far too little a time.  Neeson.come on.of course he was great.  Ewan MacGregor was good, and could have been better if he hadn't been relegated to a ""Robin, watch the Batmobile"" role for a lot of the movie.  Natalie Portman was FANTASTIC. I was very, very impressed with her performance.  Samuel Jackson is in the film far, far too briefly, but he does fine as one of the Jedi Council patriarchs.Acting solid for the most part, even in the smaller characters like Anakin's Mom and the Queen's Bodyguard.  Writing brings it down.The Effects/Art DirectionStellar.  Amazing.  Awesome.  Completely computer generated creatures built from scratch.  Alien vistas unlike anything you've ver seen.  Coruscant's night side is a spiderweb of mile-high skyscrapers.  Visually, this film was amazing and the effects and computer-genned characters were seamless.  I will watch it again (on video) to marvel at the look of the filmConclusionAs a setup for the fall of Anakin, this movie serves its purpose.  It introduces the main players that will accompany the fall of this doomed figure over the next six years and executes some amazing special effects, easily the best I've ever seen.The story, though, is in dire need of a critical edit, as was the film itself.  Characters needed fleshing out, exposition needed toning down, pace needed speeding up in a lot of places, dialogue retooled, focus acquired, and the concept beefed up (starting out any movie with talk of tariffs and blockades gets the viewer into ""news at 11 mode"" and eyes get glassy).  My prediction:  this film will be a blockbuster, but it will barely break the top 10 grossing movies of all time (if it reaches it at all).  It WILL make the Top 20, but I can't imagine that enough SW fans are devout enough to want to see such a poor addition to the series a second or third time.All that said, I can't wait for the next prequel.  It's gotta be an improvement.",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

The Worst of the Prequels,"Out of these movies, this movie is the worst. The film contains content to a more G-rated sci-fi film. Holy, Chicken Little. This movie is not the best and it is the worst. I could match the disappointment of this film with Return of the Jedi. I wish this film was better off without Anakin as an 9-year old boy. The only part that was good during the film was the light saber duel. A 'Star Wars' fan like myself would be very appreciative to find out that this sequence is lightning fast. These duels reach above and beyond the stars. The duels are hostile and awesome to a certain extent. The prequel movies have the best duels and of course these duels are better than A New Hope, The Empire Strikes Back, and Return of The Jedi. I wished the story and actors had a better role in the entire prequel trilogy. The disappointment of the prequels were that it had no story, plot or characters we could relate to. It seemed as if the special effects told the story. I was very dismayed with this movie, I hope that the T.V. series does better than this trilogy.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Overhyped? Nahhh!! Feed me, O Lord Lucas!","Well, it always happens, doesn't it? You wait, and you wait, and you wait for something, and inevitably it doesn't turn out to be nearly as good as you wanted it to be. The Phantom Menace is by no means a failure, but it does have some problems. Probably the best way to look at it is to compare it to other sci-fi films, not to other Star Wars movies. It's going to suffer in comparison to the others in the series, but it IS better than most of the sci-fi drek that's out there.If you have not seen the first three (or is that the second three?) Star Wars movies, two things come to mind. First, WHY NOT? Second, you won't understand a lot of the nuances of this latest installment, in which case you shouldn't even bother with this review; you should check yourself into a halfway house that'll make you watch each Star Wars movie over and over again for 24 hours straight.Now, for those of you who did see the other movies, and somehow avoided this one when it was in the theater (shame on you!), rest easy. You'll probably still enjoy it on the small screen, provided your small screen isn't a 10-inch black and white number. The effects come across surprisingly good on TV. What's really interesting, though, is that when Star Wars first came out in 1977, the special effects were about two decades ahead of their time. Now, the effects are still state-of-the-art, but the rest of the industry is a lot closer to George Lucas's company now than it was 22 years ago, so we're not as overwhelmed as we were then.I won't bore you with plot details. Let's just say there are a lot of droids, there are empathetic, Ewok-like beings, there are lightsaber duels, and there are some cool battle scenes. What slows this production down a little are the incongruity of the Jar Jar Binks character (WHY?), and the somewhat slow pacing. For the other Star Wars movies, it felt like a lot of action was packed into a 100-minute movie; for Phantom Menace, it seemed like a lot of non-action was packed into a 120-minute movie.Bottom line is this: When I saw this movie in the theaters, I loved it!

My one big complaint is that the sleek, silver troopers collapse like boiled broccoli at the slightest touch--they pose no threat.  And Jar Jar Binks seemed stoned to me.

"worst in the series, but still worth watching","I grew up watching Star Wars and have loved it for 20 years, much like most other fans of the series. When Episode I first came out in theaters, I loved it. I mean, NEW Star Wars!

As we began watching it, I hung my head in horror as I realized how bad a movie it really was, at least in comparison to the other Star Wars films.

Time both helped and did not help this movie,"Going back and re watching this movie in 2022 was an interesting experience. On one hand, the prequels don't get much credit and some elements of the movie are fantastic. The over all plot is solid and some of the acting (Liam Neeson especially) is some of the best actinium in the entire Star Wars franchise. But on the other hand, you have this mess of out-dated 3D special effects and some very odd line delivery from some of the characters (Anakin Skywalker and Queen amadalla mostly) that just makes some scenes feel so empty.A few thing that stood out the most to me re watching these with my wife now that we are adults was that 1, jar jar binks was actually quite a funny character and brought a lot of much needed Comedy relief to some of the very dry parts of the film.

The film was great,I thought that the film was great and i can't wait for Episode II to come out in 2002.

Disappointing,"When I read the review of The Phantom Menace in TIME Magazine, and how it was a letdown, I didn't take it seriously.  But here I am, saying the same thing, The Phantom Menace was a letdown.  Let me say the good part.  The special effects, sound effects, and art direction was wonderful.  Many scenes were awe-inspiring, and breathtaking.  Plus, they were years ahead of anything ever done before.  I'm a sucker for visuals.  Give me great visuals & I'll like the film.  But they can't alone make me love it.  The story and characters have to be original and interesting, and that's where The Phantom Menace falls flat. Jar Jar Binks is a immensely annoying character, made merely for the kids to enjoy.  The characters aren't interesting at all.  I didn't really care for them, or what happened to them.  The story is weak too.  While the beginning and end of the movie are entertaining, the 30 minutes in between are incredibly boring.  It's 30 minutes of talking and talking and talking, saying basically the same thing over and over and over.  The acting isn't superb either.  Liam Nesson does the best job of all the actors, and his job is only a little on the good side. But the film, when there was action, performed it with class. That's what I enjoyed about it.  It was fun during those parts. Don't get me wrong: It was a GOOD film.  NOT GREAT.  NOT SPECIAL.  The expectations for The Phantom Menace were too high, and Lucas didn't deliver.  Hopefully, he will deliver next time with Episode 2.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"I didn't understand the plot until I heard ""Weird"" Al Yankovic's song.","OK, so ""Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace"" was a big letdown for us all. Apparently, most people even understood the plot when it came out. It wasn't until I listened to ""Weird"" Al Yankovic's song ""The Saga Begins"" - the ""American Pie"" spoof - on his album ""Running with Scissors"" that I understood the plot.But overall, it seems that if this happens before the original trilogy, then the technology should be less sophisticated, not more. Oh well. C'est la vie. It was interesting seeing people like Liam Neeson, Samuel L. Jackson, and Christopher Lee co-starring in a movie after all these years. This may sound weird to everyone, but my favorite character was Jar Jar Binks; why did everyone think that he sounded Jamaican? I thought that he sounded Cajun.So that's my take on everything here.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
It sucked.,"I cannot believe all the hoopla this film has gotten.  I really liked the original Star Wars because it was fresh and the graphics were new.  This movie is nothing more than the same stuff I've been seeing on computer games for the past 5 years or so.  Frankly, I got tired of all the computer graphics in the first 1/2 hour of the movie and was waiting for some real acting to begin.I was really disappointed with the lame writing and acting in this movie. The actors involved are capable of so much more.  The only reason to sit through this farce is Natalie Portman.  She carried the entire movie and I predict she will become a major leading lady in years to come.The storyline is long, drawn-out, hard to follow and down right boring. All in all, I'd say spend your money on something worth seeing like ""Entrapment"" or ""The Matrix"".",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

"The worst of the hexalogy, but not as bad as people say.","Watched as part of a Star Wars Marathon, hence the shorter review.This film is very looked down upon when held against the rest of Star Wars, but I think it's better than people give credit for. It's an easygoing and fun experience, if not as strong in story. The set and environment design is stellar, no pun intended, and easily the highlight of the film. Character design and practical effects were very hit and miss, but the CGI was atrocious. It was worse than *that* fight scene in The Matrix: Reloaded. You know which one I mean. Jar Jar was annoying, but nowhere near as bad as people make him out to be. The acting was fairly mid-tier, but Ewan McGregor is always a win. Plus, every fight scene involving Darth Maul was just a blast to watch, and the fight choreography was fast paced and so so smooth. Bonus points for the iconically comical scene transitions. And, of course, I quoted the memes every time they came up. Overall, a fun, but fairly weak film.68/100--Admin--

The movie starts out well enough, Jedi taken out droids, but then it SLows down when they arrive on tatooine and slows down even more when they reach coreasaunt. The story of ANakin as a little boy with a retarded Jamican sounding side kick...just..well..sucks! The only thing that saves the movie is the last 40 minutes or so. The fight with the Gungans look cool, but YOU DON'T SEE ANY OF THEM DIE!. There are some dead ones in the background if your looking really hard for them. At least in Jedi, you see an Ewok by the farm. The fighter scene with Anakin, was pretty bad until he blew up the control ship by accident. The best character (qui-gon) gets killed off and that's the only emotional link the audience has to the movie. Did I mention how the pod race is fun the first time you see it, but after that you skip to the chapter on the DVD where darth maul almost runs over Anakin.

very good movie,"This is one of the best movies I have seen. there story was basic but complex at the same time, and they explained the story very well.

The special effects were one of the best I have seen in a movie, they did a great job with the lightsaber and the blasters looked awesome too, and the droids were really realistic.

a bible fantasy creation,"In the first trilogy it's easy to find, considering the empire and the republic, a lot of common points with the roman and greek history. in the new trilogy we begin to taste something that it's always deeply connected with the roman history and it is the story of Jesus Christ. It could be just an interpretation but the character of Anakin is designed as a new saver while the cities of Tatooine remember Jerusalem. Lucas created something that could be considered a generational phenomena but he didn't do it by chance he really touched our most important roots.

"Takes on some really big shoes, but it's pretty good","Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace is a prequel to the original Star Wars. A young Anakin Skywalker (Lloyd) is found by Jedi knight Qui-Gon Jinn (Neeson) and his Padawan Obi-Wan Kenobi (McGregor) they aim to train him in the way of the Jedi, and to keep him out of the hands of the Sith.Phantom Menace uses a lot of CGI which does detract from the overall experience.
Not to mention everyones most hated character Jar Jar Binks adding to much slapstick to Star Wars.
But otherwise everything else good.
The actors all do a good job in their respective roles, the film is filled with some excellently choreographed action sequences and their is still a level of intelligence in it's dialogue.

Disappointing compared to the originals,As a stand alone movie this would be pretty good. As part of the Star Wars universe this is dreadful. It is a huge step down from the original trilogy. Jar Jar Binks was absolutely unwatchable. I just cringed every time that CGI moron opened his mouth. I still wonder why that character exists. He serves no purpose in the movie. That movie could have easily been done without him and it would have been a lot better.,5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
One of the Best movies I've seen,George Lucas truly outdid himself with this film special effects wise anyway. The story was true to Star Wars form keeping the tradition of the original three while adding the special effects which made it a great movie. I also have to give Mr. Lucas credit for the actors and actresses he choose for the movie Liam Neilson was great as the semi-rebel Jedi who always argued against the council rules and Ewan Mcgregor was the perfect choice for Obi-Wan. I don't know how Mr.Lucas found such a perfect kid to play Anakin but it will be interesting to see how he turns such an angelic boy to the dark side.  My favorite character has to be Darth Maul though he is the best bad guy I've seen in years and he fights as a Sith apprentice should His weapon is just incredible and the way he moves so gracefully is amazing. Some people may say they were disappointed I cannot see how maybe your expectations were too high? The only downfall was the annoying alien Bin he should have had a smaller role(he is no Chewbacca) but he was funny in some instances.  My thanks to George Lucas for continuing the Legend with such style I for one cannot wait for the next installation.,,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Will be more appreciated someday if parts II and III satisfy.,"I agree with most die-hard Star Wars fans in that this flick could have been a heck of a lot better than it was.  It was commercially packaged and promoted for TODAY's Sony PlayStation playing youth, not the Atari-playing kids that grew up with the original trilogy (not to compare movies to video games, but I think y'all know what I mean by that).  In other words, I feel somewhat cheated because I feel like George Lucas wasn't really thinking of us when he made this movie...Particularly, Anakin Skywalker is shallowly depicted as nothing more than a cutesy kid that plays with really cool toys.  I would have thought that Lucas would portray the young Darth Vader as a gifted, pure-of-heart, yet troubled child, so as to create a more insightful and profound commentary on the most important and mystifying theme in the saga:  ""The Force.""  After all, you may as well use some depth when initially developing the character that will eventually become one of if not THE most famous villain in the history of modern American cinema, rather than lazily writing it off as childhood innocence (I could go on).But the positive side is that it was successful in creating a launchpad for the next two films, and, although not as thoroughly as I would have liked, introduced the characters in the saga that will in essence ""give birth"" to the heroes, struggles, and scenarios of parts 4-6.Hopefully Mr. Lucas has taken into deep consideration the Star Wars purists' critical backlash of Part I while producing Parts II and III, and we will one day look back at Phantom Menace with the same sense of nostalgia as we now do A New Hope.  Good luck George.6/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Star Wars: Episode Dumb - The Phantom's [CENSORED],"I saw this movie when it was first released two years ago and from what I remember I must say that this movie will be in my memory solely because it disappointed me so. Episode Numb has so many hang ups.The plot is vague as though Lucas himself wasn't sure where his story was going. The actors mumble their lines as if they can't believe what they've rehearsed, and the animated characters especially Jar Jar only add to the viewers frustration. I think Lucas was experimenting with this particular character. He wanted to know if his team could create a computer generated character that would be believable and life-like. That Jar Jar annoyed audiences worldwide is testament that Lucas succeeded. Although I think the voice behind Jar Jar was the real source of annoyance.The animation on the whole was definitely good, maybe on par with that of the dragon in 'Dragonheart'. The computer generated world and set designs were visually interesting and the pod race reminded me of the chariot race in 'Ben Hur'. Some of the action sequences seemed to have been thrown in here and there perhaps to snap viewers from their stupor.When it's all said and done what Lucas has managed to create in Episode Mum is eye-candy visuals for the masses most of who are not pleased with a story that is so thin and un-inspired.I've seen the original 1977 Star Wars countless times and when Episode Gum comes to the small screen no doubt I'll watch it again but only to see if I made a mistake about it.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Great effects shame about the script.,"Why oh why won't Hollywood producers spend some money on decent scripts as well as special effects?  Do they really think we are so stupid that we will just be dazzled by computer generated worlds and characters?  Surely George Lucas is rich enough to care about not just getting people into the cinemas but also ensuring them a quality experience when they get there?  This film seems to me to be a tremendous wasted opportunity to create a great drama around magnificent state of the art special effects and visual wonder.Where were the characters?  Neeson and McGregor, both excellent actors, were given nothing to do but wander about fighting droid warriors and some guy in Prodigy make-up who had no personality at all.  Even the Queen spoke like a robot.  The only decent character was the young boy.  Where was the fun, humour and humanity of the earlier films which were character driven not effects driven?  Han Solo, Chewbacca, Princess Leia , even Luke had real personalities, and the droids R2D2 and C3P0 were hilarious.  And the films said something about inner truth and trusting ourselves.  This film said nothing at all.Please Mr Lucas feed our intelligence and not just your pocket.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

The Saga Begins... beautifully,"I am so tired of people putting down Episode I. I find it hard to imagine a better first chapter to a story so many people know.On May 19 I waited in line for three hours to get my tickets and I was not disappointed. In the movie we learn some answers to questions that have been asked for 20 years. And we are now asking some new questions. Hidden in the film are some wonderful inside jokes. Familiar lines, characters who one would think are looking for a way to phone home (see trivia on this movie) and some wonderful foreshadowing make this film so great.The biggest thing to remember is that once again we are only seeing the first of three chapters. You have to expect some questions not to be answered.The fight scenes are absolutely breathtaking. They are so fast-paced and energetic. You can clearly tell how much more formal training these Jedi had as compared to Luke.Darth Maul is the new Boba Fett. Only in Star Wars could a character with so few lines gain such a big following. This guy is one of the most evil people I have ever seen.This movie keeps the tradition of Star Wars by entertaining the masses with out the need for senseless violence, foul language, or any kind of nudity. Through out this story two main characters and several pilots die, but little blood is seen. This is the sign of good movie making.My reactions to popular complaints...(THEY SAY) The acting was sub-par.  (I SAY) What movie were YOU watching?!?! Jake Lloyd is a child. Did you really expect him to be quoting Hamlet?(THEY SAY) Jar-Jar Binks is annoying. (I SAY) Jar-Jar is one character. Stop obsessing about him and he will go away.(THEY SAY) The movie is racist because some characters have stereotypical accents. (I SAY) Classic case of ""Darned if you do, darned if you don't"". If everyone spoke exactly the same people would say the movie was racist because there were no foreign sounding characters.(THEY SAY) The movie did not live up to the hype. (I SAY) The public created the hype. As far as I know there were only two trailers. People who had missed the band wagon back in 1977 tried to make a new one this year. They wanted toys, posters, stand-ups and contests. They were the ones who told themselves they would learn about how Anikin turned to Vader. They set their expectations up way too high. Don't blame Lucas.I must admit that the film is not perfect. But what is? This is George Lucas' story. He will tell it his way. We should be thankful that we get to see these chapters at all. If you think you could write a better story, or direct a better movie, go right a head. I'm sure there will be people here to pick it apart for you.My best advice to fans who felt let down, is go see it again. The movie gets better with every visit. You know the characters, you can understand some of the accents easier and you have more time to catch the things you might have missed.And if you still don't like it? Well, why don't you just go and rent Titanic again because I guess you just don't get it.May the Force be with you.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Pressure,"Not only to write a comment about movies like this one (because many love them, at least as many as that loathes them), but especially and more importantly for George Lucas to make this movie. It's one of the damned if you do, damned if you don't situations, you wouldn't like to be a part of!So even if I don't think this is a great movie (CG is very good here too, although you might be distracted from CG characters if you've seen them as Muppets, in previous films, such as Yoda), the Saga had to start somehow. And because the pressure was so high and many people didn't think it delivered, they looked for a culprit! And they found themselves one in the (CG) face of one Jar Jar Binks. He's an easy target indeed, but was invented for family value only. Still Lucas took the (Jar Jar) criticism seriously in his next installments ...

A good (not great) addition to the Star Wars saga.,"I have been debating for a long time whether or not to write a review on Episode I. Star Wars is not just another film series to me, it is a very special series. The Empire Strikes Back is definately my favourite movie of all time, and I did not want to have anything negative to say about Episode I.After first viewing this film, I was a little bit shocked at how ""candy coated"" it was. It seems that this film was made for children. I just could not grasp the fact of a young Darth Vader running around yelling ""YIPPPEEE!"". It made me quiver inside. However, after viewing the film today on DVD, while listening to the commentary track, I have finally been able to grasp more about what Lucas was thinking when he made this film. Lucas wanted to make Anakin appear as a young man, who was very kind and generous. This way, it would be alot more interesting to see just why he turns to the dark side. Think about it...if Anakin was a little trouble maker from the beginning, it would not be as interesting. We would know right away why he turned. Anyone that was in trouble their whole life, would obviously be sent down the dark path. However, in making Anakin a good little boy...it just makes it more interesting to see why he turned. Where did he go wrong? What kind of choices does he make? What in the world could possess such an innocent child to turn into one of Hollywood's greatest villains?The story is definately not spectacular, like any of the other three original movies. However, remember that this is the first act in a very long story. Lucas needed to introduce the characters, give them a little bit of a history. This way, further in the series, we will know exactly where they came from.Of course this movie will never live up to the original trilogy...but it is very far from being the worst movie ever made as some like to claim. If you have a DVD player, invest a few dollars, rent the movie, or better yet, buy the movie. Watch it with Lucas' commentary on. You will definately see a different side to ""The Phantom Menace"". It really helped me in learning to accept this movie into the fantastic universe of Star Wars.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Thank God for IMDB Guidelines!!!!,"At a rather crusty 39 years of age I can say I grew up on Star Wars. From those heady days of 1977/78 I remember going to my local movie house and watching Star Wars IV in Widescreen Dolby. God...that first five minutes will live with me for ever....those battle cruisers slowly crawling into the screen from above almost made me wet myself. I knew then I was hooked by the Star Wars franchise.The Empire Strikes Back is my personal favourite since there's a lot more time to develop the characters and their particular  mannerisms, coupled with a rip-roaring sfx-supported adventure. (I'm sure my jaw dropped between my knees when old Darth announced to Luke that he was his old man!)Return of the Jedi is my least favourite even though the sfx were more defined & flexible back then. But the film stank of corporatism & product-placement, especially those irritating Ewoks.But after a 17 year wait I was convinced Lucas would turn it around again and emphasise the drama in PM rather than any external commercial forces.The hype swept us along until finally the film arrived on UK shores. I was one of the first to queue up, hoping against hope that  the hype was no mirage of wishful thinking!Oh dear! With the exception of the first dazzling 10 minutes this film stunk to high heaven. I guess those people too young to have grown up with the original SW trio loved this; but for me, and perhaps many others, PM was dreadful.I left the cinema cursing LucasArts and the way he had allegedly sold out to the money men. No Ewoks to speak of but that was quickly substituted by Jar Jar Binks.Fortunately the IMDB guidelines prevent me from truly venting my feelings for the film in general and Binks in particular. I hate this film and judging by the older audience I shared the movie with they did too.17 years of waiting & hoping for something special but nothing has changed and Lucas has finally lost the plot.It's a slim hope that he will take on board some of the genuine negativity from his fans and prove us all wrong by producing an awesome Star Wars 2""The Force is (no longer) strong in this one!"" */*****",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Disappointing. And what's up with Darth Maul?,"I did not think that a lack of substance could leave me disappointed at a Star Wars movie, but it did. The technical achievement of this movie is beyond what you expect, most notably the pod race and the deployment of the battle droids in the final battle scene. I even liked Jar Jar. But the script was lame, the was not sense of urgency and the great evil presence that over shadowed Episodes IV, V and VI simply wasn't there. And then there's Darth Maul - what a grave disappointment. Good movies have great bad guys and Vader is one of the all-time greats. Darth Maul is extraneous fight scene filler (albeit well-done).  He had no more personality than a school yard bully. I would not recommend this movie, although I will see Episode II and hope for more. **1/2 out of ****.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

As a member of the movie-going public the only issue that matters to me is rather simply stated: Is a film worth spending the time and money to see. Is it fun, entertaining, or otherwise rewarding. Phantom Menace was certainly entertaining and fun and even interesting.

Great,"Simply greatI'll make my comment short, there are 1700 others to read anyway if you want the details ;)* The music is excellent. I have the soundtracks from all SW movies, and I am thinking very seriously of getting my hands on other Williams stuff, like Jurassic Park.* Special effects - 10/10.* Storyline. Well, it satisfies me and serves its purpose. I am certain that when seen in context with the coming two films it will shine. It is inferior to ESB, but it shouldn't be a surprise, it is after all the beginning of the saga, and has to get everything going.* Title - another user discussed the meaning of ""The Phantom Menace"". I interpret it as Darth Sidious being the phantom menace, pulling all the strings. My guess is that Sidious/Palpatine was one of the supporters of the trade tax which made the Trade Federation easy to approach when Sidious had a deal they could take advantage of. The blockade and invasion later permitted Amidala, influenced by the Senator, to move for a vote of no confidence in the Chancellor. The sympathy generated from the Naboo invasion then helps Palpatine getting elected. Sidious is the phantom menace, and the Jedi still has no clue who he is. It will be interesting seeing how this is developed.* Acting - well, I think it was good. Nothing was bad enough to attract my attention, but I have no problem admitting that I'm not a big critic of acting.* Characters. I do agree to a certain extent that they aren't developed enough, especially Qui-Gon Jinn. However, the book by Terry Brooks ""solved"" this problem for me. It provides lots of additional depth to the movie and character development. Jar Jar? OK, he was annoying the first two times I saw the movie, but then I got used to him. :) Lucky me ;) Watto was quite excellent, and I  also liked Boss Nass. Darth Maul *wow*. The apex of the Star Wars experience, I think, was for me the moment when choir accompanied a zoom-in on Darth Maul as he ignited the second end of his lightsabre. Ah!! What a moment! Obi Wan, well, both he and Padmè will have more screentime in the next two films. Anakin Skywalker was OK. Darth Sidious also.I would now, after having seen the movie four times, not hesitate a second to give it 10/10. This isn't fair to other movies, since my judgment is affected by the fact that I'm a HUGE fan (I can discuss Skywalker/Vader's influence on the fall of the Republic for hours, etc.) and when I'm viewing it, it feels like TPM fits into a greater whole. This makes some of the usual criticism baseless, since one can say it is meant to be that way. Small things like that the uniforms of the Republican Guards bear much resemblance to those of the Imperial Royal Guard, Vader's breathing on the end of the tape, the Sith Infiltrator's similarity to the TIE Interceptor.. well, it feels perfect. And I should not forget the smile of Portman at the end, :)), quite a re-run of Fisher's in Episode IV, don't you agree? ;) The camera panning to Palpatine after the Yoda/Windu-sequence with ""...was destroyed? The master, or the apprentice?""... I could go on forever. 2002, people, 2002. :)",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

This is Star Wars and I bloody loved it!!,"I'm a huge Star Wars fan. By huge I mean verging on obsession. I grew up with the original trilogy and had pretty much all the available toys when I was younger (Still have them!). When a new trilogy was announced it was like all my Christmases coming at once. I avoided as much of the publicity as I could, only watching the trailer and skipping any magazine articles on the subject. I wanted to enjoy the film and have nothing influencing it. I knew who was in it but that was about it. However it was hard to avoid all the negative information that was spreading. As much as I tried I knew that this film was largely not well liked. This didn't bother me after all it was Star Wars, how bad could it be? I went to the cinema in anticipation and sat down. Then it started. STAR WARS came upon the screen and the hairs on the back of my neck stood up. This was it. The yellow text started scrolling up the screen and I couldn't help but smile. The smile of a true fan.The film starts out with two Jedi Knights arriving on the planet Naboo. Once there they are soon fighting for their lives. When they flee the planet they take with them the Naboo Queen, her guard and a native of the planet Jar Jar Binks. During the film we are introduced to a variety of characters and plenty of mystery. The end of the film is a showdown between the Jedi Knights and a mysterious alien that pushes them to their limits. The new 3D conversion is good although maybe unnecessary. It adds a new dimension to the film and on the huge cinema screen draws you in even more.The film looks amazing, as only a Star Wars film can. Using modern filmmaking techniques George Lucas creates a film like you have never seen before just like he did with the original films. Once again he uses a mixture of established actors including Liam Neeson, Warwick Davis, Kenny Baker, Anthony Daniels, Terence Stamp, Brian Blessed, Samuel L. Jackson, & Ian McDiarmid and up and coming stars Ewan McGregor, Natalie Portman, Ray Park, Dominic West & Keira Knightley. George Lucas has a talent for finding the perfect person for the role. The cast is excellent and make the best of their parts. What George Lucas isn't known for is his script writing. Once again, just like the first Star Wars film it doesn't make much sense at first but this is what all the haters of this film fail to see. This isn't a single film, it is the first of three films. When viewed as a trilogy it all falls into place. There is a reason for everything. Yes, the character of Jar Jar Binks is annoying, but he eventually serves to be the downfall of the galaxy. Many people were too busy hating him and ignoring his appearance in the following films to grasp this. Also yes, Ewan McGregor appears to be terrible in this, but he was meant to be that way. He is playing a character that is still finding his way in the universe and relies on his master for guidance. View the character in the following film and you will see the maturity and wisdom of the character all through the brilliant acting skills of Ewan McGregor, the stand out performance of the film.Some films shouldn't be over analysed and just enjoyed and this is one of those. This film is Star Wars like no one had ever experienced it before. The lightsaber battles are incredible, the space battle spectacular and the use of CGI is second to none. I don't know what everyone else who saw this expected but it was exactly what I wanted.The original film is known as a master piece in film making using techniques never seen before. It is also know for bad acting, terrible script and bad direction. But so is this one. It used effects never seen before and it also has all the flaws of the original film. But it is hated! Look at the original film now as if you have never seen it before. It is bad. But it is bad in a good way and put with the next two films it all falls into place to make a great story. This is also true of the prequel films. Individually they all have flaws, together the flaws don't matter. This is Star Wars! When you first saw them some of you were probably children. You got lost in the experience and they blew your mind. You saw the new ones as a cynical grown up with your lives full of responsibility and maturity and the experience was wasted on you. Bet your kids loved the new ones though!? This is Star Wars and I bloody loved it!!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Better than people say!,"Okay so yes I do agree very much that Star Wars episode I The Phantom Menace will never be as stunning as other Star Wars films such as ""A New Hope, ""The Emipre Strikes Back, ""Return of the Jedi or ""Revenge of the Sith"" which are all some of my favourite movies. However I do not believe that it is worthy of all the badmouthing it has received over these last lot of years by many critics.As regardless of some of the stuff it lacked in certain places I felt it made up for in other areas in the plot, acting and effects etc. Star Wars episode I The Phantom Menace told us the start of the saga involving two Jedi knights Qui-Gon Jinn(Liam Nesson) and Obi-Wan Kenobi(Ewan McGregor) who while on a mission to end the greedy trade federations blockade of the planet Naboo and restore peace to the Galatic Republic have to stop and have there starship repaired on the Hutt dictatorship planet of Tattoine, where they discover the young slave boy Anakin Shywalker who's dream is to one day fly away in a spaceship and train to become a great Jedi knight.Gui-Gon who believes strongly in young Skywalker chooses to take him with them back to the Jedi council to have him trained in the ways of the force, unaware that the path way he is taking will change him into the evil Sith lord we all now from the originals as Darth Vader.Another character that deserves a mention is Padme who was played perfectly by Nataile Portman. She is such a cute actress IMO.When I ask some of my friends why they disliked this film they usually blame it on the one same thing Jar Jar Binks, who I must say yes can be a bit annoying a lot of the time, although I must confess that I did find him rather hilarious in the battle between the Gungans and the federations droid armies.What I would say to people who hated The Phantom Menace due to Jar Jar is to just ignore him and not let him spoil the whole episode for you and concentrate on the rest of the story.The character who impressed me the most I would have to say is Qui-Gon Jinn due to the great acting from Liam Nesson who give yet another wonderful performance.Darth Maul was an excellent new villain and he, Gui-Gon and Obi-Wan have a great fight towards the end of the film, which has very good light sabre effects and is set in a rather interesting location.To be honest the only problems that I have with this movie are the pod race on Tattoine carrying on for a bit to long, the way it sometimes doesn't connect to the original trilogy very well in parts and there not being enough scenes with Darth Maul featured in them.Overall this movie is not perfect and by no means flawless. However I think it has been trolled enough over the years and its time to look for the more positive parts in the film which believe me do be come visible to your eyes once you watch it a certain number of times.Overall a Star Wars episode that is more good than it is bad ( Despite what others would tell you IMO ) I give episode one the Phantom Menace a well deserved 7/10 stars. Nothing beats "" The Empire Strikes Back "" though!",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"This Movie is a real Phantom Menace, but entertaining as well","As a big Starwars fan i cant help feel disappointed with this installment of the StarWars prequel., It lacks emotion character development and serious acting, although the script had something to do with that. Too comical for a Starwars film even if it was intended to kids. Apart from this and Jar Jar, and whats the deal with Boss Nass and his slobbering. Visual were stunning. The Saber duels at times were filmed too close. Altogether one Big Opppps!!",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
OK but not great,"The movie didn't compare to the others, and I hope the next one will be better, but it wasn't bad.

In Defense of Star Wars,"This is an above average movie.  A lot of the reviews here seem to be emotional knee-jerk responses more than thoughtful comments.It does live up to decent-movie standards but it doesn't accomplish the nearly impossible task of living up to is it's hype.  I think this is why there are so many over-negative reviews.I do think this film was made to indulge a filmmaker who just wants to keep telling his story.  It is an interesting one and you can't blame him for trying `capture the magic' of the first three films.  Of course, that didn't happen but we did get a good movie out of it.This film had an exciting story and a lot of pretty pictures.  I don't know if all the animation was necessary but it wasn't overly distracting.  I gave this movie a 7 because it's good.  It's not great but it's definitely ahead of the curve.Many blast this movie calling it `truly horrible in every aspect' or saying the pod race was to `apease uncultured masses that are hungry for action no matter how absurd'.  Considering there are movies out there like `The Fast and the Furious', `Rollerball' and `Collateral Damage' I think calling Star Wars Episode I the worst movie ever is way out of line.I also think knocking this movie for having `action' is ridiculous. While I do agree that over-the-top, everything-blows-up type movies are silly, this movie IS a space adventure.  Things SHOULD go `woosh', `boom' and `zap'.  In fact, the special effects are a huge contribution to the legitimacy and appeal of the original movies.  Besides, movies tell stories with moving pictures, without action you might as well make a radio play.As far as this movie having `blatant racism'. with Soul Brother Jar-Jar and the `devious but clumsy mechanations of the evil Asain trade guild'Get a life.One potentially valid comment I've heard is `the biggest movie disappointment of my moviegoing life'.  With all the Star Wars hype, this movie was bound for disappointment unless it had a cameo from Jesus and included a free Super Bowl ticket.I liked this movie.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Nostalgia or Actually Bad?,"Everybody that hates on this film always cites their reasoning as someone that grew up with the originals. But have we not heard the one that grew up on Episode I? (And IV, V, and VI) No they only liked it because they didn't know any better! They were kids they were stupid! It had no storyline! Granted, I have seen Red Letter Media and many others and I actually agree with their points. But there's one thing I would like to say to them. Episode I influenced me to be a writer. It can be told as a short story actually. I would run around with my toy lightsaber pretending to beat up battle droids and my mother would ask me, ""Jimmy, do you want to be a Jedi when you grow up?"" and I said, ""No, Mommy, I want to be the guy that writes the stories."" I'd learn new things and words from my mother explaining what was going on. The simple beginning where they just dash through the droids, the pod race was a favorite, as was the epic dual at the end. The sad truth is that you don't feel that way once you're older. You notice flaws and become more aware of the story. Look at it this way, every generation has their own thing. You had the original Star Wars, your fathers had the old westerns, their fathers had classic literature. The generation before doesn't get or like the next one. The reality is that they're all stories. Whichever one influenced you doesn't matter cause all good ideas come from somewhere. I was four years old when I said that I wanted to write. I'm eighteen now and that hope has never for a single moment left me. Cherish that, George Lucas.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
An ambitious yet divisive entry,"""The Phantom Menace"" marks the beginning of the prequel trilogy in the iconic ""Star Wars"" saga. While it boasts impressive visual effects and memorable characters, including the introduction of Darth Maul, the film is marred by uneven pacing and underdeveloped plotlines.Director George Lucas takes viewers on a journey to a galaxy far, far away, exploring the origins of beloved characters such as Anakin Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi. However, some fans find the film's reliance on CGI distracting, and the political intrigue subplot may not resonate with all audiences.Overall, ""The Phantom Menace"" lays the groundwork for the prequel trilogy but fails to capture the magic of the original trilogy. Despite its flaws, it remains a significant chapter in the ""Star Wars"" saga.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Well..Here's MY opinion..,"Okay, guys, in my opinion... Episode I DID lack heart. Sorta. It is easily my least favorite SW film. It pulled off the entertainment aspects though. It also started to give me that Star Wars vibe I wanted.I admit Jar Jar was bad. I admit Jake Lloyd is a bad actor. I admit TPM lacked true heart and soul. I admit some of the lines were bad. I admit some of the lines were acted bad.But TPM didn't really require anything much, I was so happy that Lucas was going to show me the backstory. Well actually, considering TPM is actually the first Episode, I was going to get background on the sequels.All I wanted was rousing action and basic plot setup. You know what I got? Rousing action and basic plot setup. I knew that these characters were going to suffer later. I didn't NEED too much emotion. Actually, I didn't want any. I didn't desire any. I wanted the emotion to come in Episode II and Episode III.Anyway, I got my action and my plot setup. I got my Jedi and Sith battle. I got my special effects. I got my cool new worlds like Otoh Gunga and Theed. I got my cool new aliens and species. I got my cool new characters. I got my cool everything. It was Star Wars. Bad acting and dialogue comes with it. And that's okay. Is it Lucas' fault? Sure. But even I knew, when I was a kid watching the original trilogy, well, I was familiar with cheese. And it is that cheese that makes Star Wars, well, Star Wars. TPM wouldn't feel right without some mozzarella.Anyway, TPM satisfied me on a plot setup/entertainment front. The film ended with a fat bullfrog yelling ""PEACE!""CLASSIC.It's not THAT bad people...",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Childish and an over-used cgi,"The phantom menace -for star wars supporters' eyes at least- should have been the great opening to the prequel saga, bringing in -other than some of the old trilogy characters and new one- mostly a new point of view of the world of star wars, bringing it to a new mature tone, placing the political sphere of this world at the center of the plot.Well, simply... it did not happen.George Lucas tries to alternate these serious tones with moments that should serve to ""dissolve"" the tension but which are stupid and childish - we can call into question the character of Jar Jar Binks.This, combined with a preponderant and constantly annoying CGI and a very slow progress of the film - just remember the enormous duration of Anakin's competition - makes the film not appropriate to a slightly more adult audience.Having said that, it is necessary to say that episode one has some positive aspects, just like the characters of Obi-Wan Kenobi, Qui-Gon Jinn, Darth Maul and Palpatine above all, which represent the real flagship of this film.After all, Star Wars - The Phantom Menace closes as one of the two weakest chapters of the Skywalker saga, being a film - unfortunately - insufficient.My rating: 5.1/10.",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Not a bad movie, but still more of the same.","Good Points:  Clearly the strength of Phantom Menace lies in the visuals. Lucas makes the most of current FX tech with mind-blowing computer animated eye candy.  Also, we finally get to see Jedi combat the was it was probably meant to be all along.  Well-choreographed fight scenes are abundant, and if the pod race doesn't make you grip your arm rests and grit your teeth, then you must be from L.A.Bad Points:  More so than in any other Star Wars movie, the story is severely lacking.  It's hard to punch Lucas in the arm for this, though, as he's clearly setting things up for the next movie.  We may very well experience the something similar to the original three films, having the middle movie turn out to be the best.  But by itself, the story is nothing special.  And as far as I'm concerned, Jar Jar Binks can take a long walk out a short airlock.  This character serves one purpose: comic relief. That's it.  Totally unnecessary, and further illustrating Lucas's penchant for keeping things just cheesy enough to make intelligent adults get that ""Oh...come ON!"" look.  Even the title is ridiculous.  ""Phantom Menace"" sounds like a Scooby Doo episode.Bottom Line:  Basically an enjoyable movie, but it just doesn't capture the drama of the other Star Wars films (what there was of it).  If you're a Star Wars fan or into eye candy, you won't want to miss it.  But don't expect to come away with the meaning of life.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

"1 down, 2 to go","Episode I was just what I expected it would be; the beginning.  I know there are several out there who condemn Episode I because it did not live up to the first three installments.  I agree.  It was not even close to being as epic as the other three.  But you have to remind yourself, the first three was years after Episode I.  Star Wars is a story from a book.  The first chapter is almost always spent introducing characters and developing scenes and plot.  Take, for example Tolken's ""The Hobbit"".  The first couple chapters, some would say, bore us with so many names and events, its overwhelming.  But that is what makes it worth while in the end.  Which is what we have all already experienced with Episodes IV, V and VI.  However, Episode I seems complex due to the fact that, because of the first three, there are several unanswered questions and one gets the feeling Lucas is cranking this one out to start on Episode II.I loved this movie.  One thing I did that may be helpful for those of you out there is not to watch any promos. Stay away from all the trailers.  Go into the movie not knowing much at all about it.  Lets face it, we all already have our own expectation for what we should be seeing.  Don't let the ads create new ones.  It is my firm belief that promotion ads and marketing can sink a movie.Before I end, I do need to add one thing.  Couldn't they have found someone better to play Aniken.

While the amount of special effects shots was tremendous, the technology didn't seem to enhance the nature of the beast, but more like taking the predetermined ideas and relegating it to nominal status. Too much to put in simpler terms. However, from a lay standpoint, the film was entertaining in many places, giving us a taste for what will be expected from the other two movies.

A Great opening act to the Skywalker Saga,"This film gets a lot of hate, but it has a good story, great characters, a good climax and a great soundtrack. It is a underrated movie and is a good start to the Skywalker Saga. It introduces the characters very well, Liam Neeson is great as is Ewan McGregor, Natalie Portman, Iain McDiarmid. Jake Lloyd is also great as little Anakin Skywalker and didn't deserve the ridiculous amount of hate he received.

the first chapter of star wars...although not as we expected,"This movie is looked upon as a failure when considering the huge hype that surrounded the release of this film. The reason being is that the script is dull in comparison with large chunks of dialogue becoming tedious after about twenty minutes. Almost all of Natalie Portman's lines are about politics!!!The other perhaps more important reason for this being a flop is that there's a serious lack of continuity with the original saga. Characters such as the viceroy, jar jar Binx,Qui Gon Jin, Darth maul are all introduced and then discarded in the following film. It really would've been better if Qui Gon Jin never existed, and Obi Wan was already the Jedi master and Anakin was his apprentice already...there's no real absolute need to give Anakin a background of being a pod racer with a mother etc All thats really important is that he good and will turn evil. The movies opening sequence is a waste of time because nothing is achieved when concerning developing the films plot....and an hour into watching the film you realise the story hasn't actually taken you anywhere since the opening sequence. I think the scene in which the main characters arrive in Corrosant would have been a nice place to start the film....the just of whats happened could be easily explained in the writing at the start....and maybe episode 2's storyline could be weaved in somehow...like Anakin being hired to protect Padme by the council could occur immediately at the start of this film....the fact that Qui Gon Jin is introduced and Obi Wan his apprentice means Anakin is insignificant and not developed in any way throughout the film.Also jar jar Binx should be axed as he makes the film somewhat childlike.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Made by machines for machines,"THE PHANTOM MENACE is one of the biggest disappointments in my memory. This is what Shakespeare meant by a tale told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, signifying nothing.  After watching this, I think we should take back all those unkind things we said about PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE.Way back when, I saw the first STAR WARS at least seven times: that was just at the actual movies, we're not counting video or cable or anything.  It's structure was that of a classic western, but the way it created a whole new universe was bold and original.And if you saw the first one, you really needn't bother with any of the others.  Everything is pretty well laid out in the original, with the notable exception of the nature of the relationship between some of the characters that comes clear in RETURN OF THE JEDI.But now comes THE PHANTOM EMPIRE, which was so boring that I went sound asleep in the middle of it: not an easy thing in an auditorium equipped with DTS sound.  Maybe it's a case of my having become cynical in the twenty-some years since seeing the first STAR WARS, but I was amazed that so many fine actors could be hired for this project and then cast adrift.Did George Lucas even bother to be on the set when the scenes with live actors were filmed, or was he crouched over a monitor watching the special effects?  If there was a director on the set, he was sleeping more soundly than I was.One performer does stand out for special commendation.  Samuel L. Jackson, bless his heart, manages to say a line to the effect of ""Return with the queen to Naboo,"" and he says this with a perfectly straight face.  He doesn't giggle or snicker or anything.  Although I'll bet that in the vaults there are hundreds of feet of unusable takes with him giggling, stammering, or just laughing his head off trying to say 'Naboo' with a straight face.This movie is garbage.  Boycott it, and don't buy any of the millions of products with images of the film on it.  Instead, go to the video store and check out STAR WARS and treat yourself to a movie that dares to be original.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Twenty years and this was the best Lucas could do?!?,"The Phantom Menace: After Naboo is blockaded by Imperial forces the planet's young ruler is faced with a difficult decision: does she give in to the aggressors, accept defeat and save the lives of her subjects or fight and risk destruction?I remember waiting in line with friends for hours to see Star Wars over twenty years ago, and have seen each parts of the trilogy many times since then.  Consequently, I was thrilled when Lucas announced that he was ready to start filming the prequels.  And on the day Menace was released, I once again found myself waiting in line for hours with friends, anticipating a great movie.  I've never been so disappointed.The Star Wars franchise is synonymous with special effects and this outing is no exception.  Unfortunately, whereas the fx have always been there to wow the audience they also bolster the story.  Here however they take center stage: the underwater scene, and the pod race scene for example, could easily have been cut in half without altering the plot (if you can call it that) in any way. I kept expecting George Lucas to pop out at any moment and say ""See what we can do for your movie!""  The film also spends too much time and energy pandering to the kiddie set.Much like ""Return of the Jedi"", ""Menace"" succumbs to the ""cuteness-factor"" whereby cuddly creatures are introduced to draw the kids in.   In this case, it comes in the form of Jar Jar Binks, a computer animated creature who speaks in a bastardized Jamaican patois.  I found him annoying from the moment he appeared and grew to loathe him within minutes - I kept praying he would be struck by an errant asteroid or cleaved in two by some psychotic alien.  No such luck.    Then there's the acting.There were several weak performances in Menace, the most noteworthy being Jake Lloyd - he gave such a wooden performance it sounded as though he was reading directly off cue cards.  Where was Haley Joel Osmont when they were casting? Ewan McGregor is also guilty of walking through his role and turning in a passionless performance.  What happened to the headstrong young jedi that we heard so much of in the later films?  If it wasn't for Natalie Portman, there would little to recommend about this film.Let us hope that they devote as much time to the plots for the next two movies as they do to special effects.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
A good but not awesome introduction to the saga,"As a big Star Wars fan, I expected a lot from this movie. I wasn't born yet when the first 3 movies got released to general public but I saw them all multiple times and I always have the same amazement while watching them. They revolutionized the way to do Sci-fi movies and always will be considered as classics.The prequel movies are less captivating my attention even if I like them a lot. The Phantom Menace is the one I like the least.The only purpose of this movie was to introduce us to several Star Wars famous characters: Obi-Wan Kenobi, Anakin Skywalker, Yoda, Palpatine, R2-D2 and C3-PO. It also adds new characters like Qui-Gon, Padmé Amidala and Jar Jar Binks.This last character was focusing the attention. I don't know what he brings to the story. He is clumsy and all he is doing is messing around and only succeeds to escape a dangerous situation thanks to a great shot of luck. He is technically insignificant and just here for a comic purpose. But it's rather annoying than anything else.Padmé is more interesting to the story. She is reminding Leia. She has the same will to fight rather than surrendering and she is really tougher than she actually looks. We can see it during the final battle on Naboo. So I could feel that she and Anakin would be in a relationship in the next movies.Qui-Gon Jin is an interesting add too as Obi-Wan Kenobi mentor and master. He is bold and wise in the same time, coping with the Jedi way while still trying to keep his independence, which push him to disagree with the order on some matters.But the one character who is particularly underrated is Palpatine. Ian McDiarmid is one genius actor. He already starred as Palpatine in the original trilogy and he kept the essence of the character which is deep evil in a deceptive respectable appearance. That is certainly the best move from George Lucas to cast him again as Palpatine so does his decision to call Anthony Daniels to reprise his role as C3PO.Now as always the story telling is beautifully managed. There is a continued story between the movies and the Phantom Menace acts as a beautiful first chapter. It is visually and orally enjoyable to see. The CGIs help a lot the story and keep us entertained. So it deserves a 7 out of ten because realizing a prequel while we already know in depth the story and then keeping all the suspense away is a hard task.

Critic-Proof Extravaganza That Will Please Most Viewers...,"To deeply criticize this wonderfully fun motion picture is to miss the point.  George Lucas and his Star Wars galaxy is so out-of-this-world, how can a critic, or even an angry fan pick it to pieces?  Does it not have sensational sets, spellbinding space battles, perky aliens, and, most importantly, the beginning of a long journey of the cinema's most famous villain? It does and Lucas wows us with a new look to an old universe. People cannot forget that this whole deal takes place ""a long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away.""  It's called escapist entertainment, people, and who better than George Lucas, the creator of the original critic-proof trilogy and the Indiana Jones Trilogy to allow us to catch up with some young versions of some old friends and see sights you will never see in real life.EPISODE I - THE PHANTOM MENACE is a sprawling thrill-ride that is meant strictly to entertain and produce candy for the eyes.  It's geared towards kids, but with some universally adult themes.  So were the others.  With this effort, an unforgettable story of failure and redemption has its beginnings.  Sometimes a bit confusing, those with a discerning eye for detail and a general knowledge of episodes IV through VI will get it (this would include most of the civilized world, excluding the negative critics who place too much emphasis on the wrong things in this film).  It's funny that my comment regarding a terrific movie is actually a defense argument against those who miss the point of the Star Wars films.  Suspend disbelief (of course), realize that this is only the FIRST in a succession of films that will tie all confusing loose ends this episode presents together (isn't that what we wish for), and just sit back and let the film fly over you.True, the performances and the dialogue are dry and as corny as a farm in the summer, but weren't the other 3 films of the same mold.  The story and the world the characters exist in is what we watch these films for, not for some revolutionary method acting or drama.  STAR WARS - THE PHANTOM MENACE is a throwback to the old Flash Gordon serials, with great-looking bad guys and a beautiful Queen to boot.  Just check out the saber-duels between Jedis Obi-Wan(Ewan McGregor) and Qui-Gon(Liam Neeson) with a dark lord of the Sith ""Darth Maul"".  He is memorable in appearance and fighting abilities only, but it was enough for me.  The duels are technically perfect, exciting and riveting.I would ask the makers to kill off ""Jar Jar Binks"" the most annoying character in a film since Mickey Rooney played ""Puck"" in 1935's A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM.  Other than that, the performances are measured, but well within the context of the story construction and special effects.  Why do critics want Jedis winning Oscars, or Paul Newman-esque acting in the films? They don't need it.  For the young at heart, both in life and at the movies, take EPISODE I for what it is - brilliant entertainment and the start of a long, strange trip through a galaxy a lot more fun than ours.RATING:  Let me think...a 10 !",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

I do understand George Lucas' philosophy and type of story telling so it is easier for me to understand. It sets up a whole new era of Star Wars so you have to expect it to be a little slow. The choreography of the duels is amazing! If you think there are moments that copy the OT, George Lucas said this, ""it's like poetry, it rhymes.""
So haters can hate but it's not a bad movie when you truly understand cinema from George Lucas' perspective.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
What's so wrong about this movie?,"Straight to the point, I watched it and I like it. Isn't that the point? It certainly wasn't Star Wars (Episode 4), but it was certainly not a ""Red Planet"".Given that the story felt childish and predictable but this movie still kept my attention.The pod race and the final battle sequences were amazing, the sound was awesome and so were the special effects.On to Episode 2. For anyone who's always wanted to see Star Wars and never got around to it, best thing is to start with Star Wars (Episode 4) and then go back to Episode 1 so you don't get disappointed with Episode 1 and not watch the rest of the series. 8/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
An epicly lifeless film...,"The day I went to see this back in the summer of 1999, aged 15, was the day I felt my innocence shattered. I had so greatly been looking forward to this film and was so excited to have a Star Wars I could call my own (as in made in my generation) only to be given this piece of garbage.The actors, including heavy weights like Liam Neeson and Samuel L. Jackson, up and comers Natalie Portman, and gradually progressing into leading man status Ewan McGregor, are all wasted here. Neeson, McGregor and Jackson are OK but OK is all they are, but they don't stand out at all, nor does Portman. All I can say of Jake Lloyd is that he looks like he's having fun. Then there's Jar Jar Binks, ARGH. What was Lucas thinking? And poor Darth Maul got killed before we had a chance to get to know him.But what's most offensive of all, aside from the lifeless/passionless acting, are the continuity errors. All these years we were led to believe that Obi-Wan (McGregor) risked a lot to make Anakin a Jedi Knight, but here Obi-Wan's little more than a 2nd banana lurking in the background, while Qui-Gon Jinn (Neeson) is at the front line doing what he can to get Anakin ahead, and it's just wrong. That was what hurt me the most, the fact that the film wasn't about Obi-Wan, that it didn't adhere to previous Star Wars history.And Episode 2, alas, isn't that big of an improvement.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Twenty five years and this is the best that Lucas could come up with?,"The Phantom Menace: After Naboo is blockaded by Imperial forces the planet's young ruler is faced with a difficult decision: does she give in to the aggressors, accept defeat and save the lives of her subjects or fight and risk destruction?I remember waiting in line with friends for hours to see Star Wars over twenty years ago, and have seen each parts of the trilogy many times since then.  Consequently, I was thrilled when Lucas announced that he was ready to start filming the prequels.  And on the day Menace was released, I once again found myself waiting in line for hours with friends, anticipating a great movie.  I've never been so disappointed.The Star Wars franchise is synonymous with special effects and this outing is no exception.  Unfortunately, whereas the fx have always been there to wow the audience they also bolster the story.  Here however they take center stage: the underwater scene, and the pod race scene for example, could easily have been cut in half without altering the plot (if you can call it that.) in any way. I kept expecting George Lucas to pop out at any moment and say ""See what we can do for your movie!""  The film also spends too much time and energy pandering to the kiddie set.Much like ""Return of the Jedi"", ""Menace"" succumbs to the ""cuteness-factor"" whereby cuddly creatures are introduced to draw the kids in.   In this case, it comes in the form of Jar Jar Binks, a computer animated creature who speaks in a bastardized Jamaican patois.  I found him annoying from the moment he appeared and grew to loathe him within minutes - I kept praying he would be struck by an errant asteroid or cleaved in two by some psychotic alien.  No such luck.    Then there's the acting.There were several weak performances in Menace, the most noteworthy being Jake Lloyd - he gave such a wooden performance it sounded as though he was reading directly off cue cards.  Where was Haley Joel Osmont when they were casting? Ewan McGregor is also guilty of walking through his role and turning in a passionless performance.  What happened to the headstrong young jedi that we heard so much of in the later films?  If it wasn't for Natalie Portman, there would little to recommend about this film.Let us hope that they devote as much time to the plots for the next two movies as they do to special effects.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Rough start for the sequel trilogy 6/10,"So making a new trilogy of films that tells what happened prior to the original story fans have come to known can be a little tricky. Especially in this particular film. There are many defaults in the sequel trilogy that fans love to mock about and its understandable because there are many bad things in this trilogy I would have removed. But now lets focus on The Phantom Menace. There is a lot of talking and negotiations in the film until finally there are actions being taken by the characters. The final battle for example, took to long to happen and could have been pushed forward in the plot. The acting was fine I guess, only a few lines that became a joke in this galaxy. Example for bad writing. At last we have the famous lightsaber battle in every star wars film: Darth maul is a great character and he kicks ass in the sequence. Liam Neeson is good as always with his acting skills and Ewan McGregor is fantastic. Overall it is a solid film. The sequel trilogy started with left foot.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Would be a 9 if it wasn't for Jam Jar,"The critical backlash against this marvellous entry into the Star Wars series is what is known as unfounded favouring of nostalgia, a refusal to advance forwards and being a bunch of knob cheeses.Apart from the annoying JarJar Binks, Episode I is an incredible film, grand in scale and spectacle, introducing and elegant and historic - rather than futuristic - feel to Star Wars, additionally offering some great new characters.The style of the film is different to the originals in the sense that the effects, a main element of the saga, through the undeniable naturalism have lost the unique 80s style that fans have come to love over the years. Once the new trilogy is complete, however, I'm sure that a massive U-Turn will occur and suddenly Episiodes i-iii will be declared a new masterpiece.Think about it - does the original trilogy really have a better script than the new trilogy? The answer is no, the dialogue will always be simple and clichéd (that is the way Lucas works). This, as some may disagree, is the deliberate - this is a fairy tale after all.The introduction of Darth Maul is the highlight of the story, his appearance before the stunning climactic light saber duel the veritable money shot of the piece.Somebody please re-cut this film without JarJar Binks and then I can rate it a nine.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Qui-Gon was a great character and the actor absolutely crushed it. The prequel trilogy basically shows the transformation into vader and it was important to establish anakin properly.

Not THAT bad...,"I think people are overly harsh concerning these movies. A lot of people complain about the use of CGI vs. modeling in the original trilogy, but this is a bunch of bull. If Lucas had the capability to use CGI in the first trilogy, he definitely would have used it. The only reason that he didn't use it was that he couldn't, so instead he spent an inordinate amount of time creating set pieces and large-scale miniatures of ships (Milennium Falcon, X-Wings, Tie Fighters, Star Destroyers, the Death Star). This must have cost an absolute fortune, not to mention that the manpower effort to realize his visions must have been staggering. And while I agree that the use of models has allowed those movies to stand up to the test of time (I recently watched the trilogy on DVD for the first time in years), I still think there is a lot of good stuff in this installment. The CGI, even 6 years later, still looks as good as anything we have seen since. The concerns about jar-jar and the use of ""accidental"" actions helping to bring victory to the good guys? Hello, what about Return of the Jedi? Ewoks were easily as annoying as the gungans, and just as goofy in the battle on Endor. The acting - while Han Solo is undoubtedly one of the most charismatic anti-hero/hero characters in modern movies, people seem to forget that Luke was an extremely annoying character (especially in Ep. 4), and much of the other acting was not great (Alec Guiness excepted of course). I think Ewan McGregor, Ian McDiarmid, Samuel L Jackson, and Liam Neeson more than constitute good acting for Episode I(Natalie Portman is pretty dull unfortunately). Set pieces. This movie has some unbelievable scenes in it, regardless of what its detractors say. The lightsaber finale blows away the originals completely both in choreography and sheer electricity. The pod racer scene is another excellent sequence, and considering that this movie is 6 years old it still looks great (and sounds even better). While I would not put these movies in the same class as the originals, I do think people are extremely hard on these movies because they try to compare them to the originals, which are absolute classics. This sort of relativism leads to unfair comparisons, which harm the votes. People were under the impression that these movies would be as life-changing as the first movies - but unfortunately, that time is past. STAR WARS - A NEW HOPE was essentially the first action movie to even attempt the sorts of things the movie displayed - it simply blew people away. Unfortunately, since then, we have seen numerous rip-offs which have steeled us against being blown away by SFX extravaganzas. For all its flaws, it is still an entertaining watch - 7 of 10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

"not the strongest S.W. movie, but go see it at theater!","The plot is there.  Not as strong or engaging as Episodes 4-6 because it is primarily doing a lot of ""setting up"" for Episodes 2 & 3, but I think that most people will understand and accept this fact.  I think the current criticisms will fade somewhat in retrospect once Eps 2&3 come out.  It only relied a little upon your previous knowledge of the Star Wars mythos; I think the uninitiated will enjoy it just as much.  You Joseph Campbell fans out there looking for the same types of hero-myth cycle elements may have to wait for the other episodes, I think.  But there was one plot element setting you up (anakin's conception). Be prepared for some comedy relief elements that cater to the under-12 demographic (the Jar Jar Binks character and the race announcer(s) were silly, IMO). GREAT visuals, lots of good light saber play. Perhaps the strongest criticisms I have is that there were a couple of parts that felt too edited, like they were cut out for the sake of movie length or something- or underdeveloped.  It wasn't disjointed, necessarily, but seemed maybe a bit skimmed-over in parts (maybe it was just the script and directing).  Example: I thought Darth Maul could have been developed more. I'm sure we will see plenty more of the Sith in Ep.2&3, but I felt this character would have been able to play a bigger role in the overall plot (I expected as much, given that his face is all over the place!).  In fact, now that I am thinking about it, the difference between this and the other movies, and perhaps the source of some of the criticism, I think, is that there was not the clear definition of primary hero or primary villain (like Luke/Darth).  In fact, the best-developed character was Jar-Jar, whom I wanted to see least.   That makes it hard for many viewers (critics?) to swallow, as we are bred on this formula. Also, a sorta-scientific explanation was given about the nature of The Force, which took a little away from its mystic appeal, IMHO.Ewan McGregor does a great impression of a young Alec Guinness' voice.If you're wondering whether it's OK for young kids: to the degree that you think it is OK for a kid to see someone sliced in 1/2 with a light saber (no blood), it is OK for young kids.  I will take my 4-year-old, who is into Star Wars (he loves that part on the trailer where Obi-Wan ""pushes"" the droids down with the Force). The theater where I saw it was one of those new ones with stadium-style seating.  I sat about halfway up, slightly to the left, and the sound was awesome! (Dolby digital)  The theater warned us that the sound was going to be turned up extra loud, which was fine by me. All in all, it was great- an 8/10. It could have been an hour longer as far as I was concerned.  I left the theater wanting more, not because I felt that the movie fell short, but because I live in an immediate-gratification world.  I can't wait 'til Ep.2!!!  I will go back again at least once or twice (and sit closer next time).",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Not bad. Gungans tie with the Ewoks for most annoying toy-line though.,"What can you say about episode 1 that has not been said before? Yes, we all hate Jar Jar. Yes, we would like to pistol whip Anakin. And yes, we all wondered how the hell a ten year old boy would manage to sort out Amidala to produce Luke and Leia.It is so difficult for me to give an opinion on the Phantom Menace. On the one hand, the fanboy in me wants to say Of course its brilliant. Its Star Wars!'. But the realist in me watches parts of it and thinks god that was lame'. Its like the cartoon devil and angel on your shoulder. I really wanted to like it. I watched it at the cinema and liked it. I walked out of the cinema still liking it. And for a few days after that I told all my friends how much I liked it. But slowly things started to drift in. Obi Wan sounded like a gay butler'. Anakin was utterly terrible'. WTF is a midi-chlorian?'. And so on. But its Star Wars' I kept telling myself. Over and Over.Now the angel and devil (or realist and fanboy) are, pretty much, at a stalemate. Yes large parts of it were horrible and very merchandisey. I am thinking of taking a court order out to prevent Lucas from directing Episode III. Some of the dialogue was terrible and the less said about the gungans the better. But on the other hand, it was great to see a fully trained Jedi in action (I nearly wet myself when they ran off quickly), Qui-Gon and Darth Maul were superb (although the death of maul was a waste and his lack of screen time was criminal) , the scenery and special effects were superb. And the story, for the most part, was pretty good. I liked the idea of the intergalactic machinations put into play by Darth Sidious.At the end of the day, Phantom Menace is O.K. It could have done without several of the more stupid scenes (anyone who has seen the phantom edit knows what im talking about) and could have done with more scenes of the council, the Jedis kicking off and a bit more character exposition (with regard to Amidala, the Jedis, Maul and Sidious).So a stalemate.

"A new appreciation, but problems remain","In 1999, I walked out of the Phantom Menace in a bit of a daze. It didn't seem real. After 16 years of dreaming about a new SW film, it was finally here... and I didn't think that it was very good. It had its moments to be sure, but the bad far outweighed the good for me.Naturally I revisited it over the years, but my opinion never changed. But having been dragged by some friends to see it for its 25th anniversary/May the 4th release, I gained a somewhat new appreciation for the film as a whole, and a few things specifically.Let's start with what still doesn't work.Jar Jar. Enough said about that.The Gungans in general.The Neimoidians and their comical battle droids.Natalie Portman's stilted performances as both handmaiden and queen.A very dull first act paired with a protracted second one.A pretty generic and forgettable score by John Williams beyond the iconic ""Duel of the Fates"".Massive plot holes.Now for what I came to appreciate with this new viewingJake Lloyd isn't bad in this film. In fact, he's pretty darn good. Oh there are a few bumps here and there, but he does a very solid job as young Anakin. He runs circles around Portman, that's for sure.It's a well made film. It looks great. The location work is good, helping the whole thing to feel more tactile than the two prequel-sequels to come. And it's skillfully directed by George Lucas, who shows some flair and solid instincts.The dialog isn't nearly as bad as I remembered. Yeah, the formalities and exposition are a bit stiff, but there are several memorable lines here.As much as I hate CGI, the f/x stand up remarkably well. In fact, a lot of it is light-years ahead of many contemporary films. The Pod Race and the final space battle are especially impressive.Overall, the Phantom Menace is a better movie than I gave it credit for these last 25 years. I can't say that I'm itching to revisit it anytime soon, but when I do eventually get around to watching it again, it will be with more enthusiasm than I had going in this time.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
I feel like this ruins a better Follow up Story,"The fact that people have said this film is better than what Disney is putting out is something else. Lucas decided to throw out Story for a world building film, which isn't so bad, but in a franchise that prides itself on story, that's a disappointment to me. McGregor does give a stellar performance as Obi-Wan (and I might actually like him more than Alec Guinness) Nesson and Park also give some solid performances, but Lucas's direction feels so odd that sometimes they get lost in the ground. Anakin is a little twerp (which personally is not what I want to see from the future Dark Lord of the Sith) and don't even get me started on Jar Jar Binks. The film isn't all bad, in fact for some it may be a guilty pleasure, the beginning and end are also quite fun to watch (when you're not cringing) but the middle drags on, and feels super boring. The film isn't terrible, but to call it good I'm not sure.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

GREAT!!!INCREDIBLE!!!PHENOMENAL!!!WONDERFUL!!!!,"What more can be said about this movie?   It was incredible and extremely fun.  As both a movie fan and a Star Wars fan I was blown away by this film. For that reason, I feel I must reply to some of the criticisms I've read about this film.  There was one person on this page who put it best in saying that anybody that disliked this movie just does not know how to have fun.  I think that is true and is a shame, because the same people who loved the original movies as kids 20 years ago have now grown up into cold-hearted, pedantic nit-pickers more interested in having a religious experience at the movies than having fun.  This movie was fun and captivating.  Many people have said that there was not much of a plot. That could not be more untrue.  There is a great plot filled with political intrigue.  Many people have said there is no character development.  The whole movie is spent developing Anikin, who is supposed to be the main focus of these three films.  Many people criticized young Jake Lloyd's performance, which I thought was excellent.  I've even heard people criticize Natalie Portman's performance, and she was incredible in this film.  People have compared this film to Episode 4, saying it did not have the heart or was not as good.  Come on, Episode 4 was a bad movie... it was hoaky and cheesy and campy and that was what made it great.  You cannot compare the two films. You've got different characters, different actors, different technology, different times, and different movies.  If you want to see the same old movie, then just stay home and watch the original trilogy on tape.  I've also seen the term Star Wars ""purist"" thrown around and you can basically through that out the window.  IT'S A MOVIE!!!! And in addition to that, it's a SCI-FI/FANTASY movie.  Things are not supposed to make sense or be perfect.  It's just supposed to be fun and entertaining.  This movie delivers.  The special effects are beyond anything ever seen before, the characters are very likeable, the action sequences are intense and incredible, and I LIKED JAR JAR BINKS!!!!  If liking Jar Jar means I'm like a 6 year old, then I'm happy because the whole point of going to  the movies is to just have fun.  This movie pulls you into an incredible world and keeps you enthralled throughout.  The end lightsaber battle contains some of the best sequences ever put on film and is worth the price of admission on its own.  Don't analyze this movie by comparing it to other films. Analyze what the events of this film mean to the world of Star Wars.  Picking on this film is like criticizing the Mona Lisa because she's not smiling. Get real, get a grip, go see this movie, and enjoy it because it really is something special.  And if you leave the theater wanting more then you've got the point.  You're supposed to want more, that's why you go see the next movie.  Just go and enjoy this film, it's really excellent.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"What was the point of this, George?","I remember when this film came out, I kept putting off seeing it. And putting it off, and off. Then it came out on video, and I finally rented it. I think I was putting it off because I instinctively knew it was going to be awful, and I was right. It is one of the dullest, most atrociously acted films I've ever seen. The acting was stodgy and boring, and considering the acting talent involved (Liam Neeson, Ewan McGregor, and Samuel L. Jackson), you'd think Lucas could have done something spectacular with them. Alas, no. Lucas has said numerous times that he detests directing (this was the first film he's directed in over 20 years since the original Star Wars film), and his contempt for directing shows. It feels like a sonambulistic exercise, intent on putting us to sleep, and it has an overall lackadaisical feel that really irks the viewer. Many who saw this were extremely disappointed because they loved the originals so much (the original 3 are far superior than this tripe). They more than likely felt a sense of obligation and loyalty to see this film and the progressively worse prequels. They grew up with the original Star Wars films, and they went away disappointed and angry at the fact the prequels were inferior in every way to the originals...Lucas's dialogue is wretched, his pacing is totally off, and he seems to be killing time here. There's no real enthusiasm here, in front of the camera or in back of it. Perhaps the actors picked up on the fact that Lucas didn't give a damn about his own film, so why should they? I sometimes think Lucas purposely made bad prequels so he wouldn't have to film the final 3 chapters. And why did he decide to make the prequels? If he made the 3 films that were supposed to take place after Return of the Jedi, he would have had no real creative restraints. Who knows why George Lucas does what he does? I haven't a clue, other than I really disliked this film.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

My guideline -- I'd only be happy if this were better than Return of The Jedi, what I feel was the weak link in an awesome trilogy (but still a great film).  Rest assured, Phantom Menace does entertain, but it is going to need the rest of the trilogy to be appreciated.  If 'Empire' and 'Jedi' were never made, Star Wars would still be a landmark film, but Menace relies heavily on the big picture.  It serves as an appetizer for the main course to come.

Unengaging - sort of like watching a flashy video game,"I have to say that I found this movie far more boring than the first trilogy.  The special effects may have been much more spectacular, but I knew this would be the case.  What I was not expecting is how much this visual advancement would detract from the actual movie.  George Lucas should have spent the sixteen year layoff between films to write a decent script rather than wait for effects to catch up to his vision.  The dialogue was terrible, especially by Jar Jar Binks, his race, and the Trade Federation (what is ""ex-squeeze me?"" doing in a Star Wars movie?!?).Also, there is absolutely no character development for the new characters (Samuel L. Jackson, Liam Neeson, or the surprisingly uninteresting Darth Maul).  The characters all have an exceptional look, but the awe I feel towards them is only paper thin.  I never cared for any of them as I cared for Solo or Luke, and why should I when they show absolutely no emotion.There are some elements of the movie I did enjoy a lot.  Senator Palpatine and Anakin's mother are both stand-outs in this movie because they are given the most room to act without relying on computer enhancement.  Also, the choreography for the lightsabre fights are incredible, possibly the best action sequences I've ever seen, but these flashes of brilliance are too few and far between.Overall, I gave this film an imdb rating of 6 out of 10.  I was really hoping to be able to give it a 10.  Hopefully, Lucas will follow suit as he did for his last trilogy and pass the reigns to fresh screen-writers and directors because I'm not sure Lucas himself is willing (or maybe able) to give his CGI fantasies a rest and focus on making a fun and interesting movie like the original trilogy which I loved.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
time for a fresh look at this one,"No matter what anybody says, Phantom isn't actually that bad a film. Yes its slow in places, has a questionable script and some poor acting (Natalie Portman stand up), but in the end were we really expecting a film that would stand up to the test of time like the originals has?Think about it for a moment. Think about what Phantom has been mainly criticised for, and then look at my reasoning below.In 1977 Lucas made star wars as a labour of love. Only star wars. Empire and Jedi were made to cash in on that films success, so when people say that he has only made phantom for the money, so what if he has? He's only human after all, and if its money he wants then he did well didn't he? Film-making is a money making business, and only a handful of directors are really in it for the artistic effect it has on the world. If Lucas made these new films halfheartedly, then so what?What you have to remember firstly is that when star wars was made, the effects were top quality and state of the art. Nothing like them had been seen before, so of course they were going to get praise. These days, instead of cardboard spaceships and wires, we have CGI. Yes its weightless and unreal, with too many smooth edges and not enough variation in the different shades of colour. But was Lucas really expected to go back to technology he had used twenty years ago?The fact that many people accused Phantom as just being a tool Lucas used to sell merchandise is a moot point. Star wars was made for a generation of children (and of course adults) who were brought up imagining what they were playing with. Toys and action figures weren't as advanced, but now they are, and mainly because of star wars we have a lot of merchandising. Lucas, clearly with one eye on that market has produced a movie thats not only a movie, but a cash cow he can make even more money off. So what if star wars toys were overflowing in stores around at Christmas? Lucas knows where the money is at, and he went straight for the sweet spot. If the film you make has the power to earn you x amount of dollars another way, then why not exploit that road?The above are just superficial points. Now we have the meat of my argument.Star wars comes out. Empire comes out. Jedi comes out. All three are lauded as magnificent films upon release, and twenty five years later they still are. When you think of star wars today, you usually think of great effects, great characters, and a great easy to follow storyline. Nobody thinks about the faults.Lets look at some possible areas for discussion relating to the always loved original star wars trilogy, and the mostly disliked Phantom.Jake Lloyd/Hayden Christensen vs Mark Hamillyes I know Christensen isn't in Phantom, but you can see where I'm coming from. Yes, Lloyd is irritating as Anakin, and most people just wanted to punch his stupid whiny voice. But then, isn't that the same way most people felt about Hamill after star wars? Who can honestly say that Hamill is anything but a weener as Skywalker? Who would you rather be; Luke or Han solo? Nuff said. And Christensen is repeatedly attacked for his less than impressive acting skills. Did Hamill win an Oscar for best actor? Did Harrison Ford or Carrie Fisher? No they didn't. When the anakin actors are criticised, shouldn't we be remembering that hamill and co weren't exactly amazing back in the original trilogy?Old scripts vs new scriptPoor dialogue? Meaningless expressions and sentences? Words that nobody in the audience understand? Which am i talking about, phantom or star wars a new hope? Yes Lucas can't write a script to save his life, but as Harrison Ford so eloquently put 'you can type this s***, but you sure as hell can't say it.' the dialogue in the originals was shoddy, as it is today. Remember that when you say that Phantom has a poor script.Jar Jar Binks vs c-3poYes binks needs shooting. He very nearly ruined the movie. But in every nostalgia programme i watch people always refer to c-3po as being the most annoying character in the series. In fact, after empire came out there were calls for his head, and yes he is slightly annoying in that film, as binks is in Phantom. If we're going to attack Binks, we damn well have to attack c-3po.Overall what I'm trying to say is that while phantom has its much criticised faults, so did the originals. If we're going to have a go at Phantom, i think its fair that we do the same for the originals. After all, its slightly unfair to pick out various problems with one film, but then ignore them completely for another film thats identical.Don't let nostalgia blind you to the truth. Phantom is flawed, but so were the others!",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
why have I not been in a hurry to see it a second time?,"A few observations about ""SWE1:TPM"":1) The first 45 minutes or so had me restless: lots of talky backstory, much of it political!  Fortunately, the pace picked up as the flick progressed.2) The highly-touted pod race, while enjoyable, actually suffers in comparison to the hovercycle chase through the woods in ""Jedi.""3) What a clothes horse Queen Amidala is!  Different outfit, AND a radically different 'do, in every scene.  It's almost as if her look changes every time she walks into another room.  And how is it that Jedi Qui-Gon Jin, master of all things forceful, is unable to recognize the ""disguised"" Amidala just because she's changed into her handmaid's duds?  Are we to believe that washing the Kabuki off her face makes her the Invisible Girl? Was there a twinkle in Qui-Gon's eye to indicate he wasn't buying this? Why have I never been interested enough to see the movie a second time and find out?4) The humor is cutesy and self-conscious, but that's typical ""Star Wars.""5) I'm puzzled by the revelation that 3PO was built by Anakin.  The kid refers to him as a ""protocol droid,"" as though to a known class or model of droid; and indeed, we've already seen a (female-voiced) similar droid serving the drinks on Naboo.  So evidently the kid hasn't built him from scratch, but from scrap--or from a kit--the way a real-world whiz-kid would build, but not invent, a Chevy.  (He must've found the software, too, since we learn, in the ""later"" episodes, that 3PO speaks 6 million languages. That's a bit much for a kid so young, Force or no Force.)6) A total waste of Samuel L. Jackson.  I understand we see more of Mace Windu in SWE2.7) When the story finally gets to the thick of things, I like the way we had the good guys in serious trouble on four fronts--the battle between the Gungans and the droids; the attack on the control ship; the attempt to capture the Viceroy in charge of the invasion; and the fight with Darth Maul--only to have a sudden, simultaneous reversal take place.  I'd been afraid we were in for a cliffhanger.8) Still, it occurred to me as I watched the attack on the control ship: this was fresh in 1977; it's been done to death since then, in the ""Star Wars"" series and its imitators.  I liked ""Starship Troopers"" better than this.9) Darth Maul, while kinetic and dangerous (the swordplay choreography is VASTLY improved since '77), is otherwise underwritten: not a villain, but a thug; not so much evil as just p*ssed-off.  He lacks the towering, calm, confident presence of Darth Vader, who stole the first movie just by showing up.  Maul apparently isn't even considered by Lucas to be a character worth keeping in the series, unless we're in for a real medical miracle (I haven't seen SWE2 yet, so I don't know if he resurfaces).  And I've never cared for his silly greasepaint job, which looks like an attempt at a computerized Maori tattoo, made worse by those cheesy glued-on horns.10) And what can you say about Jake Lloyd as Boy Vader, other than: CAN'T ACT!!!  He doesn't ruin the whole movie... just those scenes in which he opens his mouth.  It looks like Lucas, up to his armpits in CGI and ILM work, picked up his daily planner and penciled in a 20-minute slot on Thursday afternoon labeled: ""Hire kid."" I disliked ""Mannequin"" Skywalker FAR worse than I disliked... you-know-who.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
A great prequel to the Star Wars Epilogue,"This long-awaited prequel to the Star Wars Epilogue was very good. The only problem is too much time was spent on special effects and not enough on character development.  It would have been interesting to have seen this movie done in the late 70's or early 80's.  None the less, if you are a Star Wars fan, this movie helps complete the story of the Skywalker family and is a must see.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"A solid escapism at times, but embarrassingly flawed","Yeap, we all know the story about the famously infamous Episode I that disappointed people so much upon its release in 1999. And the BIG question #1 I've asked myself about this movie was how come George Lucas who used to be such a wonderful director back in the past with his first Star Wars film (that doesn't mean I liked it at all, but I still have no doubt that at THE TIME it was a very good movie) in the past, started disappointing us with his very first Star Wars Episode which explores the past of the original trilogy? What on earth happened to him? Was it a financial problem that lead the unsuccess of the first Episode, did he just somewhat stupidly forgot about the mistakes he did in his directing, or was it something else? Whatever it is, I'm sure Lucas didn't mean to disappoint fans around the world. It's not in his nature. But whatever happened that lead to the unsuccess of the movie, I would advice George Lucas to be more careful next time and to think harder when he makes a movie, to avoid any possible future misleads. The one most important thing people should know about this movie is that even if it is highly flawed, it is still a Star Wars film, which means that it still keeps you entertained! Despite its flaws, I liked Star Wars and gladly enough it offers a few of the best scenes in the entire Star Wars saga, like the wonderful technical construction of the underwater Gungan city (that includes the Gungan transport as well.), the astonishing and intense light saber battle against the villainous Darth Maul (along with equally astonishing stunts) near the end of the film and the exhilarating Pod Race on planet Tatooine, during the middle of the movie. These were few improvements, so a big hand of applause to George Lucas for not driving away from the original and exciting stuff! The special effects were very good also! I also became a huge fan of Darth Maul, because of his very good makeup. The first time I saw his face in the movie, I looked at his face for the first time, in awe! His face was so unbelievably devilish looking and that frightened me! Some people complained that there was not enough Darth Maul, but that's a complain I strongly disagree with because in my opinion, not seeing him enough during the entire movie made it feel more mysterious in terms of the Sith's mysterious return, the Sith that were thought to be extinct a millennium ago, and I think it is better this way for that very purpose. Another BIG question I've been asking myself about this movie was the following: what was Lucas' thoughts behind the Jar Jar Bink character? I've learned that this character was met with generally or mostly extreme negative criticism and that I'm not surprised. Fortunately, I found out why George Lucas added this frankly not funny Gungan plague. It was for comic relief, but that of course we all know it's obvious, but here is a more precise reason as to why this character was added. From what I've read, he wanted to added Jar Jar Binks as a comic relief for people 12 years old or younger, so that might mean that it was never meant to apply to us teenagers and adults. What do you think? I felt Jar Jar was alright from time to time, but at times like almost everyone else my age I found him unfunny and annoying. When you hear 'Star Wars: EPISODE I' you hear EPISODE I which makes you feel and think that because it is the very first Episode of an entire legendary saga trilogy and that it connects with the amazing original trilogy, then it should really be a very good movie. That's exactly how I feel and think when thinking about this first episode and when I think of this sentence I feel very angry with George Lucas and disappointed that Phantom Menace was ruined. It could have been a blockbuster, but it's now miles away and a pity that you can't turn back the past and make this movie again. Have any of you guys reading this exactly felt and thought this way? Overall, Phantom Menace delivered on the friendly thrills we all want, but it lacks a full thematic richness and a narrative complexity. Despite the flaws, I spare Phantom Menace as an overall movie for all the other good things it managed to offer.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
The Phantom BS,"Some people say you should stop comparing the Star Wars Prequels to the original trilogy. That it's like comparing apples and oranges. Well, not exactly, it's more like comparing apples and turds.The reason for this is that the writing in the prequels is absolutely dreadful. Our characters aren't developed over the course of the story. Qui Gon-Jinn is not developed as a character. I'll certainly admit that he has character in that he is morally ambiguous. He has no problem trying to scam part dealers, stealing ships from the Gunguns and he has no qualms about fixing bets to his advantage. But he DOES have a problem using his powers to help the Queen to manipulate the Gunguns, even though he already did it ONCE near the beginning of this movie. I'm not so sure this guy is so much a Jedi anymore as he is retarded.Ewan Macgregor at best delivers a half-hearted performance that isn't even a shadow of a good Alec Guinness impersonation. Like I said though, this may not be all his fault simply for the fact that the characters were not developed, and therefore had no character. The kidAnakin also wasn't much either. George Lucas tried to write him as many different things, including being a slave. Now think about this. How can the kid be a slave, a pilot and a repairman?! That doesn't make any sense. Even more, how does a SLAVE get the time, money and parts to build his own droid and a pod-racer?! Therein lies another problem with Phantom Menace. The story makes no damn sense at all. We're never given a clear sense of what is at stake, or what the consequences will be of failure. From what I saw on the Queen's planet of Naboo, the Trade Federation is merely occupying the planet, and not doing anything else but that.Since there is nobody really suffering from the Trade Federation's occupation of Naboo, you get no hint at all as to why this is such a terrible, terrible thing. Second of all, when the Queen goes(with the Jedi) to the senate on Coruscant, they don't believe her allegations that the trade federation have invaded Naboo! Why not have the Jedi testify then?!Also, Anakin,his mom and countless others are slaves on Tattooine. You've got all these Jedi sitting around on Coruscant but not a single one of them can't be bothered to rescue the slaves?! There's also something wrong with Anakin constructing C3PO. First, he looks like ANY other old protocol droid, which doesn't make sense unless Anakin just took a half finished droid and just finished him. Secondly, how is a protocol droid supposed to help Anakin's mom? C3PO said in the original Star Wars ""I am not much more than an interpreter!"". Then what bloody good is he?! It makes absolutely no sense at all that Anakin would build a useless robot to help his mom! Darth Maul isn't developed as a character either, so he and his fight at the end is a total waste too.Yoda is also wasted as a character. He just sits around and discusses things with the other Jedi. He is known for his wisdom and his witty repartee. We don't get to see any of that here. Instead he spouts off ten tons of BS including ""Fear leads to anger, anger leads to hate, hate leads to suffering."". Now not discounting the numerous flaws and fallacies with Yoda's argument here, you could interchange any one of those verbs with another and it would sound more credible. Hate could lead to fear, Anger could lead to fear, fear could lead to suffering logically since by definition fear is a form of suffering.The trade federation is a group of spineless nitwits who aren't scary, intimidating and act like they have no idea what they are doing. In other words, they aren't good characters. I'd take the Ewoks over these clowns. The wooden spaceships of the Ewoks would be much more scary and imposing.Also, how does it make sense that the Queen's ship managed to escape the Trade federation's blockade when there are literally thousands of those ships orbiting the planet?! R2-D2 repairs the shield generator but they never, ever get hit by another laser blast so what was the point of him repairing it? I would have found it much more interesting if the Jedi, the Queen and her security forces used um I dunno, a strategy of some kind instead of going into the fray completely defenseless!!! Then of course, Anakin through a bunch of retarded coincidences and accidents manages to destroy the ONLY trade federation ship orbiting Naboo at the end of the movie, effectively making us wonder what happened to all the other Trade federation ships?! Couldn't another take over powering the droids? That doesn't make sense!!!! If the priority of Darth Sidious was the invasion of Naboo then why did the other ships disappear?! That is retarded! Oh, and while I am on the subject how did they get back to Naboo without the Trade federation even noticing? Anakin destroying the ship, especially by accident is very disrespectful to all the other Naboo pilots that died before him, pilots who were experienced and capable. Anakin doesn't have flight experience! He has pod-racing experience! That is NOT the same thing! That's like saying I can fly an F-14 because I have 20 years of experience driving a Diesel locomotive! Also, don't tell me Anakin was using the force because in the cannon there is no indication whatsoever that somebody can use the force first without at least a tiny bit of training!If that isn't enough for you, then think about this: I didn't even touch upon Jar-Jar or... the dreaded M-word!",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Just What You Expect,"I was determined to view this movie with few expectations and judge it on it's own merits (no small feat, since most would agree ""The Phantom Menace"" is the most hyped, most anticipated film in motion picture history), and for the most part I think I succeeded.  Having said that, I must also relate that my 10-year-old son, who watched it with me, was not immune to the hype and clearly had high expectations as we went into the theatre.""The Phantom Menace"" does not try to disguise what it is:  a prologue to both the new trilogy it begins and to the classic Star Wars trilogy it chronologically precedes.  Fortunately, this does not mean it is all introducing the characters (some new, some familiar when they were younger) and explaining the galactic politics and The Force mythology that drives the story.  The pod race sequence, the battledroid confrontation, and the climactic lightsabre duel are some of the most impressive special effect/action scenes ever put on film, and the story seldom bogs down before picking up the pace again.I enjoyed ""The Phantom Menace,"" and I know I will see it at least once more while it's still in theatres (which is sure to be a long, long time). It is not my ""new"" favorite Star Wars movie (that is still ""The Empire Strikes Back""), but the pod race just might overtake the Battle of Hoth as my favorite sequence.As to the performances, some are better than others.  None detract from the movie (even the computer animated Jar Jar Binks).  But only Ewan McGregor truly stands out.  I would also hope the sequel will afford Samuel L. Jackson with more than a cameo role.As for my 10-year-old's perspective, he told me ""The Phantom Menace"" was ""good,"" but it was obvious he came away expecting more.  More from this movie, or more from George Lucas (i.e., the next Star Wars installment)?All I can say is he wants to see it again...in a theatre!",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Starting off with a (muffled) Bang,"""Revisiting ""Episode I"" made me realize certain things weren't as bad as I remembered, but other things were far worse. This film has sort of earned it's reputation as being schmaltzy and ridiculous, and while it had been quite a few years since I'd seen this (I last saw it in 2012 when they did the 3D rerelease), I know I personally won't ever get to the point where I say: "" Whelp, I'm never watching that again."" This movie isn't that great, and maybe it's just the nostalgia factor paired with the fact that I have the ability to enjoy even the crappiest of movies, but I can't fully dislike this movie.
To me, ""Episode I"" feels very much like ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone""; there's a lot of stuff I love- the world, a few characters, the overall direction of the story, but from a cinematic standpoint, there's still a lot to be desired.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Exercise in concept and technology over heart.,"I'm not a die hard star wars fan, but i did enjoy the original trilogy very much, three films that birthed the most original and focused concepts to grace a sci-fi film, and they still impress today after almost 30 years. So been what i am, i didn't have the huge expectations that some had for what this film should be, but i was intrigued to find out the origin story and witness the birth of all those great characters.The story of Phantom Menace bases itself in politics, an alien race called the trade federation harassing the planet of Naboo, which itself must find unity between it's two separate civilisations to combat this oncoming force.This creates the basic background for the real action. The trade federation is been driven on by the malevolent Sith Lords, the sect resembling the dark side of the force, using them to gain a threshold in the galaxy for further development. Jedi ambassadors, the good side of the force, Quoi Gon Gin and Obi Won Kanobi, are sent to induce peace and a setting down of arms between the TF and Naboo. The Sith struggle to assassinate these Jedi, who find refuge in the disputed planet, where they befriend a Gungan native, Jar Jar Binks, and proceed to try and save the captured Queen of Naboo Amidala and seek safer grounds. This just so happens to be the desert planet of Tatooine, where the Jedi meet an intriguing young boy, Anakin Skywalker, a slave to the wily tradesman of the Tatooine Space Port, and part of a far larger slave population, including his family. Quoi Gon senses a great affinity of the force with this boy, and is certain he is destined for greater things.So ensues the rest of the film; space battles, a pod race, epic ground battles, light sabre duels, the eventual compromise to the political sub plot and absolutely astonishing special effects and art work from ILM to fully realise for the first time George Lucas's imaginative creation the way he wanted it, the reason he collaborated an expert team of technicians so long ago, after many Oscars, to get it to where it is now. Yep, i am a fan of the special effects, even though some have dismissed it as been overkill. This is epic stuff, and extraordinary stuff, to see such magnificent creations of a focused vision brought to life with so many different techniques, many pioneering,used for this soul purpose, plus other cosmetic touches like stunts and extras. It's this practical use of special effects that always impresses for any film that tries it, including the original trilogy. This is the crucial difference that means an Oscar nomination or not for special effects. Obviously this got one.That's 5 of the 6 out of ten. It could have been 7 of the 8, but this is why it isn't. The lack of joy, heart or commitment in most of the actors playing their roles. It really bogs this film down and it's a huge shame. The reason behind it could be the fact that the script itself doesn't hold any wit, funny humour or character. There are points when it tries, but these are artificial and basic, nothing colourful. But it's the acting that really isn't up there. A script can be the best piece of writing since Shakespeare, but if you don't have the actors to bring it to life, it's wasted. Then again, a script can be awful, but the acting can adapt to fit it, so you get melodrama and hamming, making it fun. Here, we have a script that's bland but not the worst, definitely salvageable with the right acting. That's what we don't have. Deliverance is monotonous for the most part, with occasional emotional backing at the most intense times. That's not enough to believe in these characters. In the original trilogy, all the actors seemed to thoroughly enjoy what they were doing, giving it their all and making the characters likable and breathing life into them, even when the script got extra cheesy. Here, all we get are plot pushing lines. No one seems to be enjoying or putting any effort into their work, and that reflects big time in the performances, which drains the life out of the drama and the film. Jake Loyd seems to be the only one trying, but his limited skill with young age and the script prevent him from getting any further than anyone else does. It's a huge shame because this is a talented cast that could have worked and it makes what should have been the great moments in the film fall flat. Lucas found what he was looking for in the technology, but unfortunately overlooked his actors. He improved in number II, and it looks like he has in III also, but i think this episode was important and he ruined it.It's hard to like a movie based solely on special effects and action, which seems to be everyone's argument for this film to be a success, a sheer thrill ride of action and awe. Yeah, i dug all that big time, but the originals had that and more. Heart, soul and warmth in the script and committed actors that wanted to succeed and did. This movie didn't have that and whenever it tried it either became too immature (Jar Jar Binks) or too stagnant (Some ""witty outbursts"" from the Jedis like ""I've got a bad feeling about this."" delivered in the same tone as every other line). Overall, an extra mark for a 6 because it was cool to see the events taking place that would influence the known future, plus it's got star wars written all over the production design and action and that'll keep me comin back to the sequels, whether or not i enjoy them in the end.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
So. Much. Cringe.,"Movies like this are hard to review because the good parts are so good and important events in the timeline are shown, but the bad parts are absolutely RELENTLESS.Any scene with the Gungans, especially Jar-Jar and Boss Nass, is riddled with the filthiest dialogue that can be conjured by the human mind. I get they were trying to appeal to the younger generation, since this was the first movie in sixteen years, but they went way too far with the cartoonish mannerisms. Not innocent and playful like the Ewoks were, but just plain idiotic and stupid.On the other hand, there are some pretty great scenes here, including the Qui-Gon/Obi-Wan/Maul fight and the pod race, the latter of which gave me less-epic Ben-Hur vibes.All in all, I like this movie for what it is.

I waited in line and the theatre was packed and there was so much excitement which turned to shock at how bad it was. Have you ever heard five hundred people groan all at once? I have, at this movie. Every time Jar Jar Binks was on screen doing his pathetic ""comic relief"". Every time that useless kid tried to act, and every time a fourth-grade level line of dialog was delivered. GROAN! Then everyone just got angry that this movie with such high hopes and with so many years of thought put into it was allowed to suck so completely. I hoped that it was just a ""horrible by comparison"" thing and that when I finally watched it again (today) it might not suck so much but no such luck. This movie sucks, completely, totally sucks. Avoid at all costs, it has ruined the entire Star Wars franchise for me.

"Its no original, but there's enough great stuff in here to make it feel like a Star Wars film","The Phantom Menace is clearly a weak Star Wars film, I will not dispute that. But I refuse to stoop to the level of absent-minded hatred that some detractors have. I have seen respectable, rational film critics turn into rabid, incoherent dogs at the first mention of this film. It's not that bad.Some positives: John Williams' score is once again the most terrific feature of Star Wars, and its not Star Wars without him. Production design and visual effects are eye-popping, almost without exception. And once again the film is full of memorable characters. Look at franchises like Alien, Saw and Jurassic Park - none of the later film characters will ever reach the level of memorability of Ripley, Kramer or Ian Malcolm. To me, Sebulba, Watto and Darth Maul are as essential a part of Star Wars lore as Admiral Ackbar, Lando Calrissian and Boba Fett.The film focuses on Liam Neeson and Ewan McGregor as a pair of Jedi swept up in Naboo civil unrest. Both actors amble through their awkward dialogue and try to act beside INSERT CGI HERE placeholders. You can detect a shift in Neeson in particular - watch his scenes with Pernilla August and then his scenes with Jar Jar Binks: in the former he is convincing, in the latter he barely wants to be there. For me, the acting highlight is Pernilla August as Shmi Skywalker, who conveyed a quiet suffering and dignity in her small role. Her touching mother-son chemistry with Jake Lloyd is also very important for the film. As for Lloyd, I agree he's no Tatum O'Neal, but he's a hell of a lot better than people give him credit and that he was bullied out of acting is a disgrace. His tearful farewell to his mother is probably the most touching scene in the prequel trilogy.Natalie Portman's character irritates me - a 14 year old elected official? Excuse me while I scoff. The only reason she is so young is because a large age gap between Padme and Anakin was undesirable. That pretty much sets the mood of these films - the love story is priority one, and the story comes second everywhere. Portman is fairly decent if you ignore how old her character is meant to be. Her duplicated role as Queen/Handmaiden is a fun rewatch factor, especially if you can spot a touching scene where Queen Amidala, unable to reveal her identity, formally tells Anakin that Padme's heart goes with him.Now onto the part that most people hate - Jar Jar Binks. How amused I was by him as a child, and how I loathe him now. He serves no purpose but comic relief, which would be fine if Lucas didn't insist on injecting him where it isn't time appropriate. We already have R2 and 3PO, who are funny and quirky without being childish. Worse, he is repeatedly taken along to important places without explanation - Qui-Gon objects to taking Padme along, but he willingly brings the world according to useless as his only companion? I don't think Binks ruins the movie, but Lucas seems to have done his Best (pun intended).The film is mercilessly edited, often cutting away from key scenes just as the conversation was about to get good. I'd rather know what was said next than cut to Jar Jar being stupid again. Storyboarders also insist on revisiting ideas twice in a row - big fish eating little fish in the planet core being one main example. Lucas is tacky with his writing at times (especially with any dialogue from Jar Jar) and his plot is full of holes. Lucas writes on galactic trade law and clearly knows nothing about legal concepts - ""legal blockades"", a magic treaty that can ratify an invasion and a mysterious tax increase that sets the whole plot in motion but apparently isn't important enough to elaborate on.The film's highlights are clearly the thrilling pod race and the spellbinding lightsaber duel with Darth Maul. Before this film, the audience had only seen a crippled cyborg, elderly Jedi and an amateur young man bash at each other. Here we have three peak form Jedi blademasters producing choreographic art. Its a feast for the eyes, and the only film to be so satisfying in this regard.There are many things wrong, but I will always love The Phantom Menace because it looks, sounds and feels like a Star Wars film. And that's the highest compliment I can give.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"A poor script and direction, but the film is still worth.","This film, released more than ten years after the last film in the original trilogy, marks the start of the second Star Wars trilogy, a prequel to the original movies.

In this film, directed and written by George Lucas, has the participation of Liam Neeson, Ewan McGregor, Natalie Portman, Jake Lloyd, Ian McDiarmid, among other actors.This is a film that seeks to begin a new trilogy but that's full of failures, with a single guilty: George Lucas. He made the script and the direction, but he seems so concerned about action and special effects that forgot everything else. The script is reasonable, the connection he makes with the previous films, although remote, is credible. However, it gives too much importance to things that don't matter (as the race where Anakin participates) and ignore events that, if they had been developed, would have made the film more interesting. This is the case of the Naboo's invasion, which should have been more dramatic, and Luke chose to observe coolly, from the Amidala's palace windows. Another flaw is the character's design. Lucas took all the emotional and psychological side, emptying them. There are even certain characters that shouldn't exist because they have no relevance, as Sebulba, a poor attempt to create a villain which is never threatening. The passion of Amidala and Anakin, who should have been intense and overwhelming, hardly goes beyond the exchange of glances, prudish and restrained, unable to move the audience. Its a film with plenty of action, but a huge emotional shyness, unable to make the audience shed a tear. The public sees and appreciates, but isn't attached to the characters. The most notable exception is Jar Jar, a humorous and well developed character, making the audience love him or hate him and leaving anyone indifferent. So, if by some chance the actors didn't seem to be particularly inspired in this film, we can blame Luke, as the actors did what was asked of them.Action scenes and special effects deserve applause and are, truly, the great strong point of the film. The new technologies have enabled to make wonders apparently unbelievable at the time of the first film. The costumes, characterization and scenarios also deserve congratulations. The soundtrack wasn't particularly great but the editing and sound effects were at the highest level, leading to the Oscar nomination for Best Sound, Best Sound Effects and Best Visual Effects.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
great movie but...,"I have been a star wars fan for most of my life liking both the originals and prequels (originals are obviously much better) the phantom menace (and the prequels in general) had very cheesy dialogue and there was too much cgi, when i first watched when i was around seven years of age, i didn't notice this but as i got older, i started to point it out. it seems to me that the phantom menace was more for younger children. jar jar binks being an example of a character for the child audience. But the movie is still great to watch (I watched the 3-D cinema remake about four times!). Finally, no star wars movie would be complete without the music by john Williams... WOW! The soundtrack was amazing, especially dual of the fates! the soundtrack is worth buying as the movie is worth seeing!",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Well... at least the title sounds good.,"The phantom menace is by far, without a doubt, the worst star wars movie. The only good things were the music (duel of the fates in particular), the lightsaber fights and Darth Maul and Darth Sidious. Bad things, however, were not enough Darth Maul, WAY to many special effects, the podrace was too long, the dialogue was terrible, the acting (besides Neeson, Portman, McGregor and McDiarmid) is awful, and that midichlorian crap. Jar-Jar I'm not even going to mention, even though he gets annoying.Not absolutely terrible, as some say, but it could have been so much more. 6/10.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
A frustrating experience and a bitter pill for Star Wars fans,"The weight of anticipation i felt for this film was beyond anything I've ever felt for a film.Maybe that was why i didn't enjoy the film? No, I've since watched it and hoped that was the reason but its failings go deeper and beyond sheer weight of expectation. This is a film that betrays its core audience.It's a confused film that spreads itself too thinly in the vain hope of entertaining a broad demographic.Unfortunately,the film fails desperately and leaves its audience flat.Jar Jar Binks is an awful character,Lucas may as well have just thrown Roger Rabbit into his epic saga.Binks is the tip of the iceberg though,the taxation plot thread will confuse kids and bore adults.The only saving grace is the character of Darth Maul,the problem is he's given little screen time and no back story.The are great effects too but one gets the feeling that effects are the reason the film exists.In his prime Lucas was an inventor and an explorer,Menace is a deeply flawed film with little going in its favour. A crushing blow to the Star Wars brand.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Episode 1 is my first taste of Star Wars; and I'd say I was 'peckish' for more rather than hungry.,"Well, here it is then; my first 'Star Wars' film. I thought it might be better to watch them chronologically rather than in the initial order as I had heard of all the hatred towards this episode so I thought I'd dislike it equally if I'd seen the original trilogy first; hence, I gave it the chance it deserved. On the whole, I'm glad I did.I found the opening half an hour or so rather confusing. I don't know if this was due to the fact this was my first ever taste of Star Wars or if it was just shoddy writing but I'll admit that it was lucky to have a bit of a Star Wars fan watching it with me otherwise I would have been completely lost. What I didn't like was the virtually vacant introduction to Jedi's and what they were (although it's assumed you've seen the other films before this one so I can't hold that against it too much) and the inaudibility of the character of Jar-Jar Binks. What also didn't help was the fact that whenever someone said something, there seemed to be an annoying little 'bleep' noise or an animal/alien moan in the background, rendering what it was they were saying equally inaudible. I thought this was rather laughable so early on as what I found to be a complicated plot set up involving a trade dispute between two planets was made even harder to follow given the fact I couldn't hear what it was that was being said.When these things were ironed out after about twenty five minutes, the film got going and although rather ashamed saying it, I was impressed. I liked how each of the characters interacted with one another, I liked the whole 'double team of Jedi's travelling around helping out' scenario and although the subplot involving Anakin Skywalker and his space racer/eventual fish out of water story was primitive; it was light hearted and enjoyable at the same time. The way the film flicked between the two situations going on and eventually culminating in a feel good finale where they all integrate was good; the trade situation was as compelling as the Anakin storyline and we're never forced to 'side' with the 'better' story as each is given enough screen time.The character of Darth Maul was another interesting thing I noticed during the film. Although he's one of those enemies that hardly ever speaks and is one of those bad guys that 'remains in the background, looming and threatening at all times' (similar to the Terminator in the first Terminator film); I couldn't quite feel the build up nor could I the menacing persona he was meant to carry. The cloaked bad guy who appeared via holograms was more of a menace and this is where the film lacked a little in the end because you knew he was never a threat and all good films/stories like this one have a decent bad guy who is always there trying to thwart the hero(s); in Episode one, there wasn't stone wall evidence of one of these.Even if the way the editing jumps between each story toward the climax is a little predictable in the way it shows the tank battle, the palace surge and the light-saber duel at the same moments in their progression (initial fighting, bad guy(s) get the upper hand, twist of fate, hero(s) winning) it was satisfying and never took itself too seriously. This way of telling the finale, I believe, was Lucas' way of saying 'don't expect an epic; just a satisfying journey coming to an end'. Hardcore Star Wars fans might not like this too much but for the others (namely me) it was a nice introduction to the franchise.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
My favorite!,"I love Star Wars! It's one of the most nostalgic things for me. When I was 5 I saw the originals and watched them everyday! I was obsessed! And then when I was 9 this movie came out and I thought it was the best thing ever! I think it's easy to just jump on a bandwagon and dis this movie, but this movie means so much to me and I don't care who knows it!!

"Come on, it is not bad","In 1983, the final chapter of Star Wars was released, and it was a great end to a fantastic trilogy. After 16 years of waiting through ripoffs, spoofs and knockoffs (Mostly like Ripoffs but I had to have three things to relate to) and to many it disappointed.What the film suffered from is the HUGE expectations from fans alike, who had been on the edge of their seat begging for this movie to come out, and the fact that it was not as good as the original 3 really hurt them inside.The film was also hurt by upgrades in Special Effects, like the overlong Space Race and the Political Debate taking up 20 minutes of its 130 minute run time. Now, let me talk about the most hated thing about this movie, Jar Jar Binks. He was a comic relief character, one not seen in Star Wars before, he was annoying, kind of like Kathy Griffin, and he really annoyed some of the most loyal fans. I personally, did not like him but he was bearable, although overdone, it would have been better if only in for half of the movie and then gradually left out, instead of a gag every 5 minutes where he trips over. The there would be a lot less anger towards it.Overall, the film is not too bad, suffers from modern Special Effects, Expectations and Jar Jar Binks but it was bearable. I rate it 68%.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
What a waste!,"I am sure George Lucas is smug as bug, I think he wanted to completely distort and rearrange the Star Wars universe just because he thinks it is his to do as he pleases, he knew that 20 years  of people waiting for the new movies would guarantee it making a billion dollars, even if it sucked.Does anyone remember watching the first Star Wars, and seeing the Stormtroopers ruthlessly board the blockade runner and waste the rebel scum, not a hint of mercy, only following their orders.The ships and weapons and equipment were realistic for a sci fi movie. It all seemed to fit together to give the perception of an entire universe of history, culture, politics, agriculture, space travel, trade, greed, crime, law enforcement, bounty hunters etc.You really felt for Luke being a bored farmer, he had adventurers blood in his veins, no liberal anti jedi uncle could remove it from his mind.Darth Vader was a cool, dark, menacing villain. He had complete command of his minions around him, a true commander in the field for the emperor. Darth Vader was a follower of the dark side of the force, which may or may not be evil. The empire did seem to control law and order, the economy seemed to be functioning, the military obviously was being funded very well. Civilians in the outlying areas seemed to have the right to own weapons which is more then most earth people can say, the Storm Troopers were made out to be regular joes in some scenes where they are talking about family and such.The empire failed to win over the hearts and minds of all people by adopting a join us or die mentallity. But that was their strategy.I won't comment on the next 2 other than to say I did not like the ewoks much, the idea of killing a Storm Trooper as an ewok with a flimsy miniature wooden bow and small stones is absolutely insane. You would think an empire that is ruthless enough to destroy Alderaan would clean out any indigenous teddy bears that could be a threat. As ineffective as Imperial troops were I don't see how they could conquer anything, why is it an armored storm trooper can't take any hits from sporting blasters yet Leia can survive a blast from a military blaster with no armor on.As bad as I thought return of the jedi was, the phantom menace was far worse. I found almost none of the ""Good guy"" characters likeable. The anakin slave plot line was real retarded, nobody wants to see a cool evil villain like Vader be reduced to a sniveling, crying slave. The race scene was just filler to make the movie 2 hours and sell some more toys, the fact that anakin won when he was way behind is totally ludicrous.I don't like the way the evil droids don't follow their orders, the senator ordered them to anihilate the opposition, he didn't say anything about taking prisoners, especially taking all the pilots and just leaving them next to their fueled and armed bottle rockets er I mean fighters. The civil war like ground battle was really stupid, why these trade federation dudes don't they have orbital bombardment methods of attack, use the droids to mop up.I think Yoda was a little out of place being on Corascunt (spell?) , I am still trying to picture in my mind him having a light saber duel with an opponent. And since when did the light and dark side of the force (which grand moff Tarkin referred to as a religion) which makes for a spiritual presence that can hop star systems and visit luke have to do with organisms that crawl on your skin and on all matter you command to make metal objects float and do your bidding. That metachlorians crap was the biggest travesty to come out of lucases mind yet. It made me wonder what his motives were, was he afraid having a religion in his fantasy world would upset someone.And to cap the movie off the honorable jedi double team Darth Maul, what kind of honorable duel was that.I rate Star Wars 10, Empire 9.5, Return of Jedi 5, Menace 2.5 (Darth Maul is all of those points). I don't expect my comments to matter, just thought I would share them.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Good movie but could have been better,"I enjoyed The Phantom Menace, but I did leave the Cinema with the feeling that this movie lacked the originality of the other three. The scenes were brilliant, the landscapes of Naboo were particularly impressive.The problem I had was that some of the scenes had a little too much predictability to them. How many of you knew that as soon as Anakin stalled his PodRacer at the start, that he was going to win the race at the last stretch of the last lap. Also the ""Don't leave that cockpit"" scene was very predictable. Secondly I must agree with the sentiments here that Jar Jar Binks and the leader of his race just seemed too glaringly out of place. I have no problem with the humour from this character, but it didn't seem to fit into the story that was going on around him.The only scene that I found to be exceptionally imaginative was the scene where Neeson and Darth Maul were on opposite sides of the Force Field, and you were shown the two separate sides of the Force, with Neeson meditating and drawing on the power of the Light Side while Darth Maul paces back and forth psyching himself up and drawing on the Dark Side. Unfortunately the other scenes played out pretty much as you expected as soon as it started. This was a little disappointing in that I was hoping to see something new and not things that have been done in hundreds of movies before this one.All that said I did enjoy the movie and would recommend that you all see it on the big screen so that you can truly appreciate the visuals that have been created here.But for those of you seeing for the first time don't expect the best movie you have ever seen, just sit back and try to forget about all the hype involved or you will be sorely disappointed.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Still on the right track,"When the Trade Federation set up blockades to prevent any shipments reaching the planet of Naboo 2 Jedi Knights are dispatched to try to negotiate a settlement. However, before they are able to do this they come under attack and flee. Along the way the Jedi Knights encounter a slave boy who they believe may have the power to bring balance to the force and decide that they will train him to become a Jedi....As with A New Hope George Lucas has once again taken full control of the reigns serving as both director and writer and as with what he did with A New Hope the results are still good, but vastly different.The Phantom Menace has a more of a 'Return Of The Jedi' feel to it than anything else and one feels that Lucas was perhaps trying to increase his market share somewhat by targeting the film at younger audiences; the fact that this film has a child protagonist is perhaps one selling point but it also has a slightly more light-hearted tone (certainly in comparison to both A New Hope and The Empire Strikes Back). The pod race is probably something else that younger audiences will get more of a kick out of than older audiences.Away from this though the story is a fairly decent one even if it feels a bit cluttered and messy at times. The villains of the piece are either underwritten or not particularly intimidating - Darth Maul is one such example (more the former category than the latter to be fair) although his final fight does at least compensate slightly for his shortcomings as a character. Jake Lloyd puts in a good performance and mercifully wasn't annoying. It was also nice to see some characters return from the original franchise such as R2-D2 and C3PO.Whilst it slightly stands in the shadow of the original films The Phantom Menace is still a lot of fun and carries its generous running time rather well. If you take it for what it is (which is an ever so slightly inferior follow-up to episodes 4 5 & 6) then I don't think you'll be disappointed with this offering.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Star Wars,"Star Wars fans had waited a very long time for the prequels to be made, in 1999 their wait was finally over. However, after watching Star Wars- The Phantom Menace, many fans were left angry and disappointed. Their main qualms with the film was the introduction of a CGI character going by the name of Jar-Jar Binks. The combination of an irritating voice, stupid appearance and adding nothing to the story made him a very unlikable character. He was just an unwanted burden thrust onto the other characters and fans alike, he is easily George Lucas' worst creation to date. However, there is some positive points to take from this film. Such names as Liam Neeson and Ewan McGregor come to mind, their acting performances helped towards saving the first of the three prequels. Plus, director George Lucas must be praised for the very good fight scenes and the exhilarating pod race. In conclusion, for me it didn't live up to the very high expectations set by the original films, but overall it is a quite enjoyable watch.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Why should you watch Phantom Menace.,"In spite of being consider the worst movie on the Star Wars series, Phantom Menace is actually a very beautiful and poetic composition, perfect for children.Create to entertain and explain how someone sweet can became one of the biggest villains of movie history.

Good-- up to a point,"Ah, yes-- Jar Jar Binks. The single most obnoxious character to ever sully the silver screen. As David Schwimmer once said on ""Friends,"" it's ""like the pilgrims bringing the Indians syphilis."" The combination of Jar Jar and an Anakin Skywalker so ""sweet and naive"" he'll raise your blood sugars up to 1000 is why this movie only gets a 7 out of 10-- with a little help from Natalie Portman. (Fortunately, she doesn't have as big an opportunity to wreck this one as the next two).Set 30 years before 1977's ""Star Wars,"" ""The Phantom Menace"" is the effects-laden tale of how Anakin started on the road to Jedi knighthood. Liam Neeson is appropriately paternal as the mentor to Anakin and a young Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor), and the film's major physical villain, Darth Maul, is one of the best bad guys in the entire series.Also included in this slightly underrated adventure story are an exciting ""Podracing"" sequence, a double-bladed lightsaber (oh, yeah!) and a very well-handled battle between the aquatic Gungans and the manipulative Trade Federation.

Definitively the worst Star Wars,"The film that should have launched Star Wars films into the modern era, The Phantom Menace is probably the definition of disappointment.To be fair to it, it's not the worst film ever made. There are positives. Liam Neeson delivers a charismatic and memorable performance as Qui-Gon Jinn while Ewan McGregor is also entertaining to watch as a young Obi-Wan Kenobi. Darth Maul is a physically threatening villain with a cool design, just a shame they couldn'y find any dialogue for him or any sort of personality. The choreography of the fight scenes, particularly the final lightsabre battle gets a thumbs up, despite the bizarre forceshield triggered breaks in the duel. The visuals generally are nice to look at. In fact the film starts and ends with promise.Unfortunetely there's a middle that takes up 90% of the runtime where nothing much happens. Unmemorable characters waffle on about nothing, borderlinecaricatures wander in and out of the movie, most notably the abominable Jar Jar Binks, an annoying child asks if Natalie Portman is an angel, is declared the chosen one and wastes 7 hours of screentime podracing to sell video games. The dialogue sounds like it was written by a 5 year old on meth using a speak and spell. It's just such a boring slog to get through. By all means watch clips on youtube of the good bits, don't bother sitting through the whole film.The one aspect of the film that is truly phenomenal - the music.

While there is some strong personality being displayed, it is done in a way that is truthful to human nature. I found the film a little too dark and a little too slow as it moves to what seems like an inevitable, bitter end. The film is more than just a glimpse into the life of a man who does know how to live, but I was wondering if he served more as a metaphor for everyone of us as a part of the human race who live better when we're on a leash.

"Definitely worth seeing, even for the jaded...","I heard a lot of pre-movie hype, about how ""It sucks, it's going to suck, it has to suck, no one can make 4 good movies in a series in a row, it can't measure up to the originals!""  Well, if George Lucas had tried to make it measure up to the original, people would have just been saying, ""It's a cheesy remake!""  You can't please all the people all of the time, but I have to think of it like this.  I never got to see the originals in the theatres, because my parents were convinced by the religious zealots they associated with that ""Star Wars"" had to do with the ""New Age"" movement, and was therefore evil.  I had to wait until the ""Special Edition"" release to see them in the theatres, and they were just as good to me, I think, as they would have been if I had been seeing them on the big screen as a kid, even though I had seen them on video several times over the years.  We need to remember that there will kids there who are seeing a ""Star Wars"" film for the first time, and this will seem like magic to them, even if YOU think it sucks, because you are older and know better, and because it doesn't have Luke, Han, Leia, etc. etc.  I thought it was great, and no amount of know-it-all fans are going to convince me otherwise.  The underwater scene was incredible, MacGregor and Neeson were great, as was Portman.  Lloyd, contrary to ""those in-the-know,"" was good too.  The effects were better than ever, which is not surprising, as most modern special-effects are based on those pioneered by George Lucas for his first Star Wars film, because there was no one out there doing what he needed.  See it with an open mind, and remember, it is the first part of three that preceed those we already know. Sure, most things seemed shiny and new in the movie, whereas they had ""used and battered"" look in the other three, but remember, this is a prosperous time, during the ""Old Republic,"" before the dark age brought on under the rule of the Empire.  I liked it, and I am sure I will like the other two, as well as episodes VII, VIII, and IX.  It's another story from another time, and not to be judged on the merits of other actors and stories that take place after.  By itself, it is great.  As a part of a larger story, it is good too.

He used to make aliens that were ""cool"" and even ""works of puppetry genius"" but now all we get is that moron Jar Jar Binky. Yes, I call him that. I hate him.

"Star Wars on.....You know, you know :)","I don't know what to make of this. Was Lucas trying to recapture the glory days of the original trilogy? I'm not sure but for the most part this film really blows. I know sequels can never outshine the original although in some cases, they do and Empire Strikes Back is a great example; directed by Irvin Kershner. Yes the film has dazzling special effects and the light saber duel at the end is great, but when the dialog is so putrid and contrived and the acting so wooden and lifelessly constipated, it leaves one feeling how Lucas can stoop so low. Characters such as Qui-Gon Jin, Ben Kenobi, and Amidala are barely developed; leaving them nothing more than vapid souls against the uninspired screenplay. The other characters such as the Gungan leader and Watto, are basically blatant racial stereotypes. To make matters worse, they casted a child actor as Anakin, played to imperfection by that little pint-sized muppet Jake Loyd. And last but not least, the most hated hated character in the SW universe Jar Jar Binks, who should've died a VERY HORRIBLE DEATH at the righteous hand of the sadly underused Darth Maul!! The original trilogy had its fare share of corny dialog, but not the extent that this movie provides. All in all, TPM fumbled critically with fans and critics and I happen to be one of them because Lucas has lost his touch with what made the original so enamored and charming: Genuine excitement. Had he filmed the prequels first back in the late '70s, then the originals later on, it could've been even greater. But as it stands, TPM is a forgettable giant pile of excrement that should forever be flushed down the cinematic toilet.",3.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
So It Begins...,"First,let me start by saying that I have seen all the movies in the Star Wars Series.I have to say George Lucas did not disappoint with this movie.The other two movies were great also. The Phantom Menace was a very good beginning to a very well written series.I also want to comment on the last two movies very briefly before I get to what I thought of the Phantom Menace.I have to say that I love Revenge of the Sith.It is one of my favorite Star Wars movies next to original series Episodes IV,V,And VI. I also liked AOTC a lot,none of the movies disappointed me. So now,I will get to what I thought about the Phantom Menace: Firstly,I thought that all the performances of the main cast were especially good.I liked Natalie Portman as (Queen Padme Amidala)and I also liked Pernilla August as (Shme Skywalker,Anakin's Mother).I also want to comment on Liam Neeson's role as Qui-Gon Jinn he was very good as Obi-Wan's Jedi Master,I also liked Ewan McGregor's portrayal of Obi-Wan Kenobi,Qui-Gon Jinn's young headstrong Jedi apprentice,however he really didn't have that much to do in TPM but when he did it was big.Ewan McGregors role in the next two movies was a lot larger. He had a lot more to do and say,his action scenes were outstanding!!I also thought that the Supporting cast did very well.I liked the artistry of the planets such as Tatoonie,Naboo and Corusant. I really liked the underwater city that is on Naboo.On Naboo the character of Jar Jar Binks is introduced,I thought that he was funny and I don't understand why people hated him so much.Well they didn't have to worry about it because he wasn't really on the screen that much in AOTC&ROTS.You also see the creation of C-Threepio by a young Anakin played by newcomer Jake Lloyd.You also get to see how C-Threepio and R2-D2 got together. You also get to see Anakin the pilot start to emerge in this movie.The movie shows what it was like before the empire was formed and also how Senator Palpatine(Darth Sidious,Emperor)Ian McDiarmid came to power and also what kind of people Luke and Leia's parents were.(Padme and Anakin) Ian McDiarmid played the role of the evil emperor(Senator Palpatine)flawlessly.It is the introduction of the Republic,""The Jedi""The Sith"" and other characters that will make up the Star Wars universe and it also introduces the Trade Federation.I just want to make a quick comment on the young actor that they got to play Anakin.Jake Lloyd was very good as Anakin Skywalker.After all(Darth Vader)had to start off as an innocent child like anyone else.I don't know why everyone was so critical of the actor,I mean give me a break he is a ""kid"" after all,give him a chance I am sure that as he gets older he will get better as an actor.I liked when it was time for Young Anakin to leave Tatoonie it really was bittersweet.He is upset that he is leaving his mother but he tells her that he will be back for her.However,as you will see when he does finally go back for her it is already to late.I thought those scenes were very powerful.You will see his anger start to emerge at what has happened to his mother but that scene is in the next movie(AOTC).You will see his anger and his conflicting emotions come to a head in the last movie(ROTS).You also see a little bit of the dark side start to emerge in Anakin in (AOTC).Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn meets the young Anakin Skywalker and he feels that he is destined for great things.I also liked the pod-race scenes,it was exciting and the effects were great.The special effects in this movie were very good and they are even better in the next two movies.The Phantom Menace is also the beginning of the love story between Anakin and Padme.It develops in to something really big in AOTC.The costumes in all of the movies were fantastic.Trisha Biggar is a great costume designer.The music in all of the Star Wars movies is great.John William's is a fantastic composer.George Lucas really did really well by getting him to do the musical scores for all of his movies.I liked the music in all of the movies especially the ""Duel of Fates and Anakin's theme"",I also liked Anakin and Padme's love theme in the second movie it was beautiful. I also liked the revised version of""Duel of Fate"" which became the newer version the""Battle of the Heroes""in Revenge of the Sith,the climatic light saber duel between Anakin And Obi-Wan.The light saber duel between Qui-Gon Jinn and Darth Maul was great, then you had the duel between Obi-Wan and Darth Maul which were both outstanding.I also feel that Darth Maul was the ultimate Sith Lord next to the Emperor and of course Darth Vader.Darth Maul really should have been on the screen more then he was.I was rooting for the Jedi to win every time of course.Finally,I think George Lucas did really well for this movie and he is under-appreciated.When are the critics going to wake up and give this Director,Producer the recognition that he so richly deserves.Good start for the lead in movie to the next two movies.Keep up the good work,George.THE FORCE IS INDEED VERY STRONG WITH THIS SERIES.I love all the movies,I will never get tired of watching them.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"On the whole, worse than the worst reports","A standard critical comment is, ""The special effects were fine; but the script ...""  Well, the special effects weren't fine.  They were an embarrassing failure.  They were never as convincing as those of the first two movies (and, on the whole, they fell short of the third as well). Very little looks or feels or moves as if it were solid.  Lucas gets around this problem by switching camera angles at random so as to never let us get a clear view of anything.  It must have worked.  Legions of fans were willing to walk out of cinemas saying dutifully how good the special effects were; and those who disliked the film as a whole found other bones of contention and so were willing to concede the point.Jar Jar isn't the only thing wrong with ""The Phantom Menace"", but he's illustrative of almost everything wrong.  He follows the central characters around like a mosquito but usually has no particular reason for being on screen.  His motivations are obscure.  He looks so phoney you wouldn't believe even when he stands still: and the more he moves, the phonier he looks.  His dialogue is horrible - but so is everyone else's.Incompetence is the verdict one must carry away from this film - a strange thing, given the number of manifestly competent people who worked on it. I am by no means willing to write off episodes 2 and 3.  But we must now write off episode 1.  The pretence that this is anything other than a turkey-shaped blot on the Star Wars series, must stop.",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"A mixed bag to be sure, but it is better than I remembered it","Within the annals of Star Wars lore, or just movie history in general, the business of Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace is something of a sore subject. Here, in one sitting, is the single most anticipated movie in the history of the medium (try to think of one bigger) and the most distressing to a generation that waited 17 years for its creator to loop around to tell us the story of the rise of Dark Vader, and the results, for many, did not meet factory standards.A decade after its initial release it may seem difficult to focus on the film more than on the public's reaction to it, but that really depends on your point of view. Back in 1999, the film didn't meet the overreaching expectations of a cynical audience, most of which were too young to even remember the elation of first seeing the first three films in a theater. For them (not me) their disappointment over The Phantom Menace made it trendy to make fun of Star Wars. Yet, your enjoyment of the new re-release may depend greatly on where you stand with this series. What are you willing to forgive? Revisiting the film again as it rolls out into theaters in a new 3D format (the other films are scheduled to be released in 3D, one per year for the next five years), I am finally able to take a step back and review it from a distance without the anticipation or the negative feedback clouding my judgment. I maintain the same opinion now that I had 13 years ago: This is a glorious science fiction fantasy, a visionary work that embellishes the kinds of ideals that science fiction were created for.Where the movie works is in the technology. That's George Lucas' trademark. The best quality of the Star Wars pictures has always been in displaying new worlds to explore and new sights to see. It is clear that Lucas was light-years ahead of everyone else in terms of what went up on screen and I defy you to find one single frame of this movie that isn't crafted - technically - with loving care.Plus, as with all of the Star Wars pictures, there is a wonderful display of Lucas' love of action scenes. All of Lucas' films from THX 1138 to American Graffiti to Star Wars to the Indiana Jones pictures and the recent Red Tails, contain at least one breathtaking vehicular chase. There is no denying that the pod race sequence, a death-defying race through the rocky terrain of Tatooine is thrilling. The advancement of those scenes, which now employ the innovation of computer generated imagery are far gone from the trench-run on the original. Plus, there's something new in the advancement of the hand-to-hand combat. The lightsaber duals of the original film were based on classic swordplay. Here they seem based more on martial arts. Watch that lightsaber dual at the end again and you'll see what I am talking about.Where the movie falters is in the human characters, and that's something that no amount of technology can improve upon. What made the original trilogy work was that we cared about the plight of our heroes. They were well-defined within an action-packed setting. Here, I still find the human characters to be a bit thin. We forgive young Obi-Wan Kenobi, young Anakin Skywalker, and R2D2 and C3PO only because we know that they are characters who will flower over the course of the series. But new additions like Qui-Gon Jinn, Padme Amidala and Shmi Skywalker seem oddly empty as characters. Their personalities seemed dusted upon them lightly like dew. They are mired in a plot that doesn't have time for them to flower as complex human beings. Most disappointing is the relationship between Anakin and his mother, which you might expect to have a little more weight. When a gamble over the podrace leaves Anakin free and his mother a slave, she is forced to let him go. Yet there's something empty about her reaction. Their parting feels like little more than a student leaving his elementary school teacher at the end of the term.Yet, while most of the human characters seem thin, the one that surprised me this time around was Anakin. As played by Jake Lloyd, there is far more complexity to him than I had notice before. He, of course, is the lynch-pin of this entire saga, a kid whose soul will be corrupted, plunging him down in to the depths of darkness before redeeming himself with the help of his son. Here we see him as a sweet-faced little kid, a boy who is industrious, and inwardly anxious for a better life. His young eyes burn with ambition and there are moments when we can see fleeting glances of the frustration that will someday consume him.Of course, I must address the elephant in the room. I cannot discuss the film without touching on the film's chief blunder (the reason film is a sore subject), the presence of Jar Jar Binks, surely the single most hated creation in film history. Seeing the film again, I realize that time hasn't improved him. I maintain now what I have said all along: a little of him goes a long way and Lucas' chief mistake was allowing him so much screen time that he seems to dominate the picture. Now, onto the business at hand: the 3D transfer. I cannot complain. I was happy that the movie wasn't over-saturated with 3D effects. Especially well-done is that podrace. It is always a treat to have any Star Wars picture - even this one - back on the big screen. I could have done without the 3D process, but I appreciate the effort. I am now anxious to get reacquainted with the series on the big screen over the next couple of years. I have a good feeling about this.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
So-So Start To The Prequel Trilogy,"The Phantom Menace is definitely not the disaster everyone says it is with Special Effects that are pretty good even 20 years later, Strong performances from Neeson, McGregor, and McDiarmid, The character of Darth Maul, The soundtrack (Dual Of The Fates is epic), and the fight between Maul, Qui-Gon, and Obi-Wan. But that's not quite enough to mask the bloated script, Jar-Jar Binks being annoying as hell, Juvenile humor (80% of it from Jar-Jar), Bad acting from Portman and Lloyd, And lazy writing for the characters. Overall, The Phantom Menace is only okay.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
One for the kids...,"As much as I really, really like ""Star Wars"" and the entire universe and franchise, then it is really a difficult pill to swallow this first prequel. And yes, it is primarily because of the clown character Jar Jar Binks. He was just too much all of the time.But I also found the entire pod race scene to be too much. Yes, visually it was impressive, but it was just a filler for the storyline. A filler that took up way too much time from the movie. And that whole wonder boy thing with Anakin just wore thin really, really fast.Storywise ""Star Wars: The Phantom Menace"" is the weakest of all the movies so far. Unless you count in those two awful Ewok Adventure movies.Visually it is an impressive movies for sure, and it is right in the essence of ""Star Wars"". And the special effects and CGI effects were great. The costumes were outstanding and really impressed me.Liam Neeson and Ewan McGregor carried the movie quite well, while Natalie Portman actually impressed with her performance in this movie.This is a child-friendly introduction to the ""Star Wars"" universe, albeit a bit disappointing for us who grew up with the original trilogy (being parts 4, 5 and 6 respectively).",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Flaws and all, a bold start to the prequels","Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace boldly crafts a new era of Star Wars that's so different to what preceded it. It may still end with a lone fighter firing 2 missiles into the reactor of a space station (its like poetry) but in every other way this is breaking new ground. It's simultaneously more overtly aimed at children and dealing with more adult preoccupations on how politics can be manipulated for personal gain.Liam Neeson is the only person unaffected by the shoddy dialogue. No matter what he's given Qui Gon remains a stoic presence who's confident in his world view. Jake Lloyd youthful optimism is cute in the moment and gives Anakin a sense of tragedy considering what follows. Ahmed Best's Jar Jar Binks is a comic relief who achieves a lot whilst making sure the politics heavy moments remain light.Whilst his screenwriting leaves a bit to be desired, George Lucas' direction and world building does everything to make this prequel distinct. The planets visited, the lightsaber battles (thrillingly acrobatic), and all the costumes are nothing like what came before, apart from returning planet Tatooine but even then there's still podracing which is a new kind of spectacle for this franchise.The visual effects strike a nice balance between the practical and digital elements. Especially because of the next two, seeing big sets and locations filled with extras is even more satisfying and the CGI that is present was an undeniable leap forward at the time. Some of it has aged badly however there's a lot that still looks pretty good and swapping puppet Yoda for a CG one was the right call.John Williams absolutely understood the assignment with this score being some of his best work. It sounds so different to the original trilogy and yet it's still recognisably the same universe. It never goes unnoticed and culminates with Duel of the Fates which really leans into the space opera intention whilst also being one of the most unashamedly epic pieces of music in all of cinema.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Not excellent but still good.,"Could this movie be better? YES! Is it a bad-crap movie? NO!GOOD POINTS:-The pod race (except the two-headed guy).-The menage-a-trois sabre-laser duel (Wow!) and the double sided sabre-laser.-Costume design (specially Queen Amidala's dresses).-The John Williams' ""Duel of Fates"" theme.-The covetous Watto character (I want more toydarians!!).-The impressive FX.-The Senate sequence (very original the floating Senators' platforms).-Darth Maul (though too few used).-The subaquatic Otoh Gunga city (cool!) and the travel across the core of planet Naboo (it'd been better if Jar Jar has been shut).-Coruscant skyscrapers and Naboo Palace (Wow!)-The superb acting of Ian McDiarmid as Senator Palpatine/Darth Sidious. I think he will be a myth. His subtle and fake diplomacy is fine!.-Liam Neeson: Not superb but fine. Correct performance of Panaka and Queen Amidala.Now, the BAD POINTS:-The minichlorians fool idea. (Can anybody inject them and to be a Jedi???  What happens if a Jedi transfers blood to somebody??? May the minichlorians reproduce themselves in a different person and convert him in a Force Sensitive guy????).-Pernilla ""stone-face"" August. She says goodbye to her little and loved boy... without any tear?? Unbelievable.-Gungan's language. It would be better if they had spoken more normal (like Yoda) or if they hadn't spoken Basic (Jabba or Ewok style). Can you believe when in the middle of the droid battle, with no human present, Jar Jar spokes the human language with the other Gungans???-Obi-Wan's poor role: I can forgive this as he will be more important in Episodes II and III.-Samuel L. Jackson movement eyes in the Jedi Council. It seems like he would be in REM sleeping phase but with ""open (too) wide eyes"" :)). At least, he's better at the end of the film when he's talking with Yoda.-C3PO: What stupid lines he has! (""Jar Jar is a very strange creature""). In my opinion even Jar Jar has better lines (a little) than him. An what about C3PO being made by Anakin? Vader was Luke's father. OK. Leias was Luke's sister. Hmmmmm. And NOW C3PO was the toy of Luke's father?????? So what will be the next? Maybe Chewie was the result of an experiment about hair performed by Luke's great grandmother with a hamster??? Buhhhh!!! C3PO appearance is forced and completely unneeded. About Artoo, well, as he doesn't talk can be tolerated.-Jar Jar: though is not good, I think it's not so bad as everybody says.-Gungans: Ewoks II with hypertrophied ears and no fur. Why, George??? Do you remember the Coways from the excellent Alan Dean Foster's ""Mind's eye"" (an alternative Star Wars story)??? They had been powerful natives and a lot more credible as warriors!-Tatooine: a planet where happens almost everything in this Galaxy. Don't you remember when Luke says in Star Wars that ""if there is a center of the Universe, Tatooine is the planet fartest away from it"" ?  More originality, please!-Jake Lloyd: He's not the worst but he's not the best neither. Maybe the blame is in his ""Yeepi!!"" lines...-The script: very poor! Except Palpatine/Sidious lines is as dry as Tatooine. In The Empire Strikes Back there were much better jokes than in this one.IN FACT, this film could be called Return of the Jedi II because:1) A (princess/queen) is captured at the start by an alien creature (Jabba/Rune Haako).2) Humans need the help of a native army (Ewoks/Gungans) to defeat a higher technology army (droids/imperial soldiers).3) Three Jedis fight in a room with a will (Emperor, Vader, Luke / Darth Maul, Obi-Wan, Qui-Gon) and two of them die while there is a ground battle (in a forest/prairie) in the planet below of a big spaceship fortress (Death Star/Droid Control Ship) that is finally destroyed.4) Tatooine again (and again, and again...)IN CONCLUSION, I give it 8.25 / 10 points.To compare: A New Hope - 9The Empire Strikes Back -10 (or more)Return of the Jedi - 8.5 (despite of Ewoks)Please, George: Let Irvin Kershner and/or Lawrence Kasdan be the director/s of Episodes II and III! Center movies more in characters and less in muppets and/or FX!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Awful,"This movie is one of the worst movies in science fiction history. Without giving any spoilers, the only things I can say are the following:||extremely inconsistent storyline. ||very noticeable plot holes. ||Anakin's narration of what he is doing and when, during each scene of which he is apart, becomes extremely annoying. Even for 8 year olds, it doesn't look or feel right. ||Age problems -- Anakin is clearly too young. ||Special effects are stocky, blocky, and could not have been worse if Ed Wood directed them. ||Due to Lucas' intent on using blue screens everywhere, the direction looks staged, ridiculous and confined. In places which should be great grand halls, everyones huddling around center stage. ||Jar Jar Binks is a very racist and overt stereotype of a black Jamaican. I found it morally offensive. Anyone who has anyone else say ""Massa"" the way Jar Jar says it should take a clear look at themselves in a mirror.This movie is absolutely unwatchable for anyone with a sense of good cinema. What's amazing is George Lucas managed to capitalize on these 7 or more bad points on this Episode 1 film, and found a way to make the subsequent films even WORSE!How could it have been this bad while the original 3 were so great? Simple: a man named Joseph Campbell was on set throughout the filming of the other movies. Those with philosophy and anthropology degrees know him as a man who did the Power of Myth series for PBS. It is clear he kept George grounded. Unfortunately he died long before George did Episodes 1-3 and the absence of the man's mind is clearly demonstrated in these god awful prequels.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
As good as a light starter before the Plat de Resistance ...,"A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away  and here we go again, John William's triumphant fanfare celebrates the return to one of the most successful and iconic cinematic sagas : ""Star Wars"". 1999 was one hell of a year for movies, even though ""Phantom Menace"" is rarely the first to be mentioned, but the phenomenon of its release was so important it makes you wonder if the film really asks for an objective review.I hate to sound like the movie snob who can't enjoy anything that doesn't have a philosophical message, something to read between the lines, a point, whatever OR that specifically relies on the use of spectacular CGI-driven visual effects; I appreciated ""Star Wars Episode I : The Phantom Menace"" (those damn titles!) for what it was : an entertaining Sci-fi action-packed film, and more than that, the commencement of an iconic saga. This is the strength of the film, and the key for an almost certain success regardless of its inner quality, it's the 'Genesis' of ""Star Wars"", maybe the one and only cinematic mythology, and if only for that reason, it's impossible not to 'appreciate' it in the humblest meaning of the word.George Lucas created a unique universe and a gallery of unforgettable characters so deeply rooted in our memories, that even the people who don't categorize themselves as fan-boys' know by name and identify visually : Han Solo, C3P0 and R2D2, Luke Skywalker, Obi-Wan Kenobi, Darth Vader, Master Yoda ... The ""Star Wars"" trilogy has the richness and grandeur of a Shakespearian saga, which, despite any flaw you'd find, doesn't deprive its films from a certain magnetism and an undeniable entertainment value. That's a fact, we're never bored by any ""Star Wars"" film for something is always strangely captivating, maybe because it's the only series with that particular status, an exclusively cinematic creation from the imaginative mind of George Lucas.You got to credit Lucas for his imagination, this ability to come up with new names, planets, stories is not as easy as it seems, try to do it, and read yourself, I challenge you not to find half of it totally unsharable. George Lucas is like a cinematic Grimm who creates a level of believability even in the strangest characters. Actually, they're never too strange or weird; after all, all the movies of the glorious saga open with a convenient alibi. And in 1999, Lucas had the alibi and the technological power, the film reminds us of how revolutionary the CGI used to appear, before it killed off the charm of handmade special effects and good old miniatures. ""Phantom Menace"" might be an exception since the use of CGI contributes to the creation of some beautiful landscapes and spectacular effects, so we can forgive the overuse of what was the biggest trend at that time.But let's get fair in our judgment, if it were only for the strange creatures, the action-packed sequences, and the special effects, the film wouldn't have crowded movie theaters the way it did, it would even have been a pretty dull film. What the first opus of the prequel trilogy cruelly lacks is a scene-stealer, and it's not C3PO and R2D2's minor scenes, and certainly not Jar-Jar Binks that would fill the gap. Or maybe I'm too severe regarding Jar-Jar, he's enjoyable in a sort of cartoonish way and I honestly don't share the harshness of the critics. At least, the trilogy had the decency to start rather than ending with a hard-to-be-taken-seriously character. In other words: Jar-Jar is no worse than the infamous Ewoks (I won't miss any opportunity to express my hate toward these Carebears-Gremlins hybrids) I have nothing against Jar-Jar and again, all these funny-looking creatures are the product of George Lucas's toy-merchandising-drive thinking, but I won't put the blame on him, we all have our little dark side.""Phantom Menace""'s enjoyment relies on the rediscovery effect. It's great to see Obi-Wan Kenobi playing the role of the disciple with the master Qui-Gon as the mentor. The casting of Liam Neeson is a stroke of genius as he exudes the sense of quiet force and masterful dignity a Jedi should have. Ewan McGregor is also believable as a younger Obi-Wan, Natalie Portman embodies the role of a queen both powerful and vulnerable, and she's so damn cute. The whole casting is pretty well done. There's the kid, who plays the young Anakyn Skywalker, while it's not a performance à la Jackie Coogan (inside joke), I guess he did the best with what was at hands; and this is not the kind of films that aims acting Oscar nominations anyways. The movie indeed suffers from a stereotypical writing, and it's not a hazard if the most cheerful lines are directly borrowed from the previous films, can you seriously do better, than ""May the force be with you""? Part of the disappointment is that they couldn't.But the parallels between the film and its glorious predecessor is not just in the script department, some scenes echo the original episode, as to highlight that history is constantly repeating itself. ""Phantom Menace"" depends a lot on the personal appreciation of the first film, and I doubt it will be enjoyed or regarded on the same level as the 1977 film, but again, this is the film about how it all started. The plot hardly matters, because it's about an evolution, it's about characters starting one way, and this new trilogy will plunge us into a series of events that will end right before the first ""Star Wars"", so let's be patient and trust Lucas.And whatever Lucas wanted to achieve, getting back to his roots, pleasing the fans or making money, I believe his desire to start the saga again was genuine and important in his life, life as a series of new beginnings.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Big & Bland & not worth seeing again,"What a disappointment this film was!   I watched this in New York the day it opened and within an hour or so you could feel the vibe in the audience go from excited anticipation to various shades of letdown.What's wrong with the film?  There's a lack of interesting characters and too much emphasis of special effects for one.  There's the eternally annoying Jar Jar and the bland plot.   Natalie Portman, a fine actress, is ice-cold and very unlikable as Queen Amibdala and Jake Lloyd as the young Anakin Skywalker gives no hint of what his character to suppose to eventually become.   He's just a kid who happens to be in a Star Wars film and it's not enough to have Yoda say he's got `anger in him.'   You would think George Lucas would have gotten someone who could act.  He brought nothing to the film.A few bright spots:  Ewan McGregor is perfectly cast as the young Obi-Wan and Liam Nessson does a fine turn as a Jedi himself.  I wish more time had been spent developing them as characters.    Watching CGI effects like Watto is not interesting after a few minutes and neither are robots because they can't act.   And why didn't we see more of Samuel L. Jackson?!   Star Wars fans have been waiting for years to learn more about the Jedi but we see mostly droids, computer-created creatures and more droids.The only cool part of the film is watching Darth Maul and the fight scene at the end.   Too bad Jar Jar wasn't killed there.    I like George Lucas but he has limits as a director.  He seems more comfortable with special effects & robots than working with actors.  For example, it would have better to have Watto, the slave-owner played by an actor.   Wouldn't you rather have watched Christopher Walkin for instance as opposed to some flying green thing with a big nose?It's hard to believe that Lucas directed American Graffiti and its worth pointing out that he didn't direct the best Star Wars film, the Empire Strikes Back.Hopefully, Attack of the Clones will focus more on human characters and plot.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Heavens! It wasn't THAT bad.,"Because everyone had passively made fun of Episode I: The Phantom Menace over the years, I was programmed to dislike it  even though I had enjoyed it back in 1999. In this way, I was also regrettably fooled into liking the two following installments (episode II & III) on the basis of ""anything's better than Phantom Menace"". Cultists and agnostics alike had felt so insulted by this film that they accepted any substitute that followed. I think there is great wrong in that, and that Episode I is an underrated film on its own.That said, it is not as easily accessible as Attack of the Clones or Revenge of the Sith  two heavyweight adrenaline-pumping rides. Granted, Phantom Menace often attempts the whole action-adventure approach by featuring a hugely entertaining Pod-Race and a submarine journey through the core of a planet  but make no mistake because this film is primarily propelled by politics. It centres on the strained relations between the Trade Federation (indirectly headed by a Sith) and the planet of Naboo, pinning the Republic and the Jedi somewhere in between to negotiate. In transporting the queen of Naboo to safety in their ship, the two Jedi Qui-Gon Jinn (Liam Neeson) and his padawan Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) are forced to land on an outer-rim planet called Tatooine. Here they meet young Anakin Skywalker  a slave with hope... and a ""clouded"" and uncertain future, as Master Yoda remarks upon seeing him for the first time.It needs to be said that in spite of its Star Wars-like promises of Jedi fights, spaceship chases and strange creatures, this episode barely has a trace  not even a hint  of the fibre of the original saga. It is an endless tirade of trade disputes, lofty politics and talkative constitutions. By interweaving some well-placed action in between the negotiations, however, the film nearly always manages entertaining. It is solid, decent, funnish and cleverly set. For more comparisons to the original saga, Phantom Menace is exhibitionist, visual, stunning  it features a thick façade of sci-fi images and special effects. But scratch the surface and it feels much poorer in substance. Clearly back in 1977, technical limitations and a modest budget required a creative mind. Now, twenty-two years later, technical possibilities were endless and the budget was massive  it was the creativity that was limited.Not limiting its failure to creativity of course since it is mostly the performances that fall flat in the film. Natalie Portman looks so clunkingly uncomfortable in all her makeup and costume as Queen Amidala that she gives a terribly wooden performance, even when she is out-of-costume. Ewan McGregor chokes on his (bad) lines as Obi-Wan, and as far as I'm concerned, only Liam Neeson feels strong here. Jake Lloyd can just go back to pre-school. Little Anakin and Jar Jar Binks drag Phantom Menace down  perhaps not in quality level but target audience level  the fans who enjoyed Star Wars in the 1970s and 1980s aren't going to enjoy a film peppered with Disney cheese and wrist-slashingly corny one-liners from cutesy fairytale creatures. Star Wars was much darker than that. Blatant comedic sidekicks are NEVER OK.Yet I do not want to solely blame George Lucas because it is clear that he once did something very cool and he has done something quite cool here too. As an adventure film with heavy political undertones, this is still pretty enjoyable, and the gorgeous setting provides visual stimuli at all times. Between the saturation of success and too many ""yes"" producers, Lucas did still have a vision  of glorious sci-fi CGI  and here it is realised.6 out of 10",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
A Film in which its Target Audience will Enjoy!,"Star Wars: Episode I  The Phantom Menace (1999, Dir. George Lucas) Story The evil Trade Federation, led by Nute Gunray is planning to take over the peaceful world of Naboo. Jedi's Qui-Gon Jinn and Obi-Wan Kenobi are sent to confront the leaders. But not everything goes to plan. The two Jedi's escape, and along with their new Gungan friend, Jar Jar Binks head to Naboo to warn Queen Amidala, but droids have already started to capture Naboo and the Queen is not safe there. Eventually they land on Tatooine, where they become friends with a young boy known as Anakin Skywalker. Qui-Gon is curious about the boy, and sees a bright future for him. The group must now find a way of getting to Coruscant and to finally solve this trade dispute, but there is someone else hiding in the shadows.Actors 'Star Wars I' has a mixed bag of actors and actresses. The problem with this being a Star Wars film, is that it's so well known, that everyone seems to be eager at scoring a role in it. The other problem is the huge amount of blue screen used, which can cause a lot of problems for those stars who have very little imagination. Some of the stars are actually very good in this film and really fit in well, and some stars feel slightly off and fill uneasy with the blue screen and the dialogue. I could use this review to slag off Jake Lloyd as Anakin Skywalker, but out of all honestly, I really do not see the problem with him. He is young and do lack the experience which other actors have, but the one thing he doesn't do it ruin the movie. Everyone brings him up as ruining Star Wars, but this is untrue. If he ruined Star Wars, then how come the franchise is still as popular now as ever? Ahmed Best brings an interesting character to life. Jar Jar Binks can become slightly annoying, but is more aimed towards the children audience, which this film is actually aimed towards. Also, Ray Park was magnificent as Darth Maul, and there was not enough of him in the film.Music As always John Williams brings an amazing score to the film. It's wonderful that John Williams was back creating the music for this universe. There are some nice action tunes played and some lovely little sections of familiar themes we've heard before. The 'Dual of the Fates' theme was amazing and so majestically played during the final fight. To put it simpler, John Williams has created a beautiful soundtrack for this movie.Special Effects The one thing you can guarantee when you enter a Star Wars film is amazing special effects. It's so obvious viewing them, that a lot of time and hard work has been put into them. There are a view exceptions though, especially the computer generated characters of Jar Jar, Boss Nass and the pod-racers. All the vehicles are beautifully created and look as if they are actually there. The miniatures which are used fit in so well with the rest of the effects, that it really makes it hard to work out which is a model and which is CGI. It just all looks so realistic.Conclusion If you've seen any of the other Star Wars films, then you should really enjoy this. Many people seem to dislike this as they feel it moves away from the original trilogy. Its main target is children and Star Wars fans. Children will defiantly enjoy this, and if Star Wars fans are truly Star Wars fans, then they should defiantly like this. You should decide beforehand which order you wish to watch the saga, as their will be two separate reactions to the films, but I recommend watching episodes I to VI, and you will be eager to see how it ends. Whatever your decision is, hopefully you would enjoy this film. May the Force Be With You!

Disappointment,"Rated PG for sci-fi action/violence.I have not seen Phantom Menace in years so I cannot tell you much about it story-wise.I don't even remember this movie that much.All I remember is that it was a disappointment after watching the classic episodes 4,5 and 6.There was so much hype for this film when it first came out but it ended up being a major disappointment.Not to say that its a totally bad film though.I remember there being some good fight scenes and Darth Maul was a pretty cool villain though he definitely does not compare to Darth Vader who is a much cooler villain with a more menacing voice.Attack Of The Clones was an improvement on this film and Revenge of the sith is the best of the prequels but none of these come close to being as good as the original Star Wars trilogy.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
The Fantastic Beginning of the Saga,"When the Trade Federation organize a blockade around the planet Naboo, the Supreme Chancellor Valorum (Terence Stamp) sends the Jedis Qui-Gon Jinn (Liam Neeson) and Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) to negotiate the end of the blockade. However the evil Viceroy Nute Gunray (Silas Carson) is ordered to kill the Jedis and invade Naboo. However the Jedis escape and Qui-Gon saves the life of the clumsy Gungan Jar Jar Binks (Ahmed Best). The outcast native takes the Jedis to his submerged city and the Gungan leader gives transportation to them. The Jedis head to the capital to warn Queen Amidala about the invasion. However she has been captured by the Federation droids but the Jedis rescue the queen and her court and they flee in a spacecraft that is damaged when they cross the blockade. They land in a desert planet and Qui-Gon Jinn goes to the town with Jar Jar, the droid R2-D2 and the queen's assistant Padmé (Natalie Portman) to seek the necessary part for the spacecraft. When they find the component, they do not have money to buy it. But the slave boy Anakin Skywalker (Jake Lloyd) offers to dispute a race with his pod to raise the necessary money. Qui-Gon feels the Force in the boy and accepts his offer. Will the boy win the race? What will happen to Naboo/? Will Queen Amidala be capable to convince the politicians to release her planet from the Federation Trade?""Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace"" is the fantastic beginning of the Star Wars saga.

Well-Done Prequel,"Star Wars: The Phantom Menace is a flawed, fun film that begins the trilogy leading up to the story found in the 1977 blockbuster film Star Wars. George Lucas once again writes and directs and produces and his talent in all three areas is evident. Without re-hashing the plot(for which the volumes of previous reviews can do), Lucas uses some of the elements from his earlier three films and expands on them in this film. The tie-in for me seemed seamless and a perfect fit, at least in the story. We get a young Anikhan Skywalker(Darth Vader) here, Obi-Ben, C-3PO, R2D2, Yoda, and even Jabba the Hut. And also the man who will become the evil, insidious Emperor. We get new characters as well. Some work very nicely(the queen and Quagon(?)), while others are not quite as effective. Jar-Jar Binks is the film's comic relief, and though he has moments of amusement - he also takes some credibility away from the serious nature and believability of the story. Lucas also relies way too heavily on CGI effects. It seems virtually everything is computer generated. But these for me are small criticisms. Overall, I really enjoyed The Phantom Menace. It has a pretty good story, some solid acting performances(Liam Neeson, Ewan McGregor doing a nice Alec Guiness, Ian McDiarmind, Natalie Portman, and the young boy playing little boy Darth), some exciting, visually stunning special effects, and just lots of entertainment bang for your entertainment buck.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Star Wars Episode 1 An Okay Sci -Fi Film But Not Great,"Star Wars Episode 1 is an okay sci-film but from writer/director George Lucas who is admirable in making this movie but there are flaws that weigh it down. Episode 1 is a prequel to the other Star Wars trilogy which is set 30 years before the events of A New Hope where audiences get to meet a younger Obi-Wan Kenobi as a Jedi Knight and a gifted young boy named Anakin Skywalker who will eventually become the feared Dark Lord Of The Sith Darth Vader. The cast for the most part are good in their roles including Liam Neeson as Qui-Gon Jinn (Obi-Wan's Master), Ewan McGregor as Obi-Wan Kenobi (played by Alec Guiness in the original), Natalie Portman as Queen Padme Amidala, and Jake Lloyd as the young Anakin Skywalker. Ian McDiarmid as Senator Palpatine (The Emperor) and Ray Park as one of the villains Darth Maul make the best of their brief appearances in the movie. Ray Park does lack screen time, development, and dialogue but he makes for a solid villain as the evil Darth Maul. McDiarmid does a decent enough job with his small part as the deceitful Senator Palapatine also known as Darth Sidious and later the Emperor. Samuel L. Jackson shows up in a cameo as Jedi Knight Mace Windu who does a good job in his small role. Yoda the one Luke meets in the previous films also makes a brief appearance. The action/fight sequences are well executed but the two sequels that followed had more of them. The only two to stand out sort of was the climatic showdown with Obi Wan and Quinn Gon against Darth Maul and the pod race at Tatooine with Anakin. The special effects were cool but you can tell it's CG. The pacing between the action was a little slow at times making it drag and the dialogue wasn't the best at times either. The one character to weigh this film down for me was Jar Jar Binks. I found him annoying and the movie could've done without his character. Despite its flaws though Star Wars Episode 1 is decent maybe not the greatest but it does reveal some unanswered questions from the previous films which was interesting. Episode 1 is a somewhat entertaining sci adventure with intense action, some humor, character development, and solid performances by most of the cast that make the film enjoyable.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
dire,"This is perhaps the only film I've ever voted a 1 out of 10 at IMDb, and the reason for giving it 1 is that there isn't a '0' option.The effects are overdone and distracting.

All Sagas have a beginning,"This is Episode 1 of the Star Wars Series. It's know to be the untold story of Darth Vadar. and it's token place 32 years before the original Star Wars Trilogy.The movie shows some familiar characters and what Darth Vadar is like as a young boy before he turned to the dark side. It introduces what the Jedi are like when it was still an active academy of peace keepers.And what it was like before the Galatic Empire was establish.The movie introduces some new characters, locations, and technology. Like any Star Wars movie it has the traditional Light Saber battles. Only these ones involve with more skilled Jedi.Phatom Menace is enjoyable to watch, but it's not a movie for every one. All of the old trilogy fans might be disappointed with this one. So I won't guarantee you that's a must see film.It's done by the same people who brought us the original Star Wars. The special effects are very good. And the Pod-Race is one of my favorite parts of the whole movie.It's still Star Wars. And a good movie in my opion. I give it 7/10.

The most enjoyable of the disastrous prequel trilogy,"Out of the three prequel movies, Star Wars: Episode 1 has taken the most heat over the years from Star Wars fans, and is widely perceived as being the worst of them. I disagree pretty heavily with this sentiment though. I believe that Episode I was perceived that way because, at the time of its release, the expectations were much higher. It is, actually, a decent movie, because it retains more elements of the Star Wars formula than the two movies that followed it. It has some strong points which made it somewhat popular when it came out, and it has, by far, the best action scenes of the prequel trilogy.Let's get one thing out of the way right off the bat. There is absolutely no defending the Jar Jar Binks character. None. He is probably the worst character in the history of film, and a product of the grossest miscalculation ever made in the medium. He is a terrible annoyance, and every single scene where he has dialog is a failure. Jar Jar is one of the many examples in this trilogy of how Lucas desperately needed some devil's advocates to impose some restraint, instead of toadies who refused to question his godawful decisions. Sadder though, Jar Jar is also an example of something that could have gone right in the film. Star Wars: Episode I is a story about two completely different races of beings finding common ground to fight a common foe. Jar Jar, at some level, should have been an important story link. Instead, he is the product of George Lucas's obsession with slapstick humor that nobody above the age of four could possibly enjoy.This is an important point that I am trying to make. Lucas is almost universally criticized by Star Wars fans as being a sell-out with this trilogy. Every bad decision is chalked up to a desire to sell toys. However, when I listen to the commentary on the DVDs, I get a sense that this is not the case. I get the impression that George Lucas wanted to tell a great story with some consistent themes. The problem is that Lucas seems to have the mentality of a five year old when it comes to telling those stories. A couple of these themes are: 1. Symbiosis – beings in nature working together for a common good 2. A technologically inferior army defeating a technologically superior foe The concept of the Gungans and the Naboo banding together to fight the droid army fits both of those themes. It could have worked, but Lucas bungled it by making Jar Jar a retarded version of Bugs Bunny who talks like a slave.Let's talk about what does work in this film. The best part about it is that it has a few terrific action scenes. The action scenes in the Phantom Menace are vastly superior to the action scenes in Attack of the Clones and Revenge of the Sith for two reasons:1. The move along the story. There is a clear purpose and objective to each one of them. The other two movies of the trilogy had pointless, boring chases and battle scenes that could have been removed from the story without losing anything of value.2. Choreography. Like the scenes in the original trilogy, the action can be followed by the viewer. It isn't a blur of meaningless CGI where you can't tell how many good guys or bad guys there are, where everyone is, and who is winning. The lightsaber fight at the end is spectacular. I love the pod racing scene, despite the conventional wisdom that it was a scene manufactured to sell video games. Even the large scale CGI battle between the Gungans and the droid army is watchable.The Phantom Menace has never gotten its due credit for being a great action movie. For that matter, the original Star Wars trilogy has never gotten enough recognition in that department either. So much commentary gets devoted to the characters and stories of Star Wars that people forget how cool and exciting they were. The Phantom Menace doesn't match up in terms of storytelling or characters, but it does match up when it comes to action.If you aren't convinced, then watch the lightsaber fight at the end of The Phantom Menace, and compare it to any scene with a lightsaber in Episode II or III. Casting a martial arts expert as Darth Maul was a wise choice. If you ask me, the prequels would have been better with more martial arts-inspired lightsaber fights. The duels in Episodes II and III suck. The scenes with lightsabers in those movies are poorly choreographed garbage between guys who look like kids playing with glow sticks.Another part of this movie that works is the two Jedi, Obi-wan Kenobi and Qui-gon Jin. They are the pillars that keep the story from collapsing into a pile of infantile garbage. They have good chemistry, and the master-student relationship is much better realized in this movie than in the latter two movies. Liam Nesson brings a great presence to the role of Jedi Master – a role that he is now typecast in because of his success in this movie. Ewan McGregor brings some presence as a young Obi-wan too, although he is badly underused in this movie.Does the Phantom Menace have some pretty big flaws? Yes. Do these problems make Star Wars I: The Phantom Menace a bad movie? Absolutely not, unless you are looking for that to happen. Jar Jar isn't in every scene, and the action is really good. If you are young and watching this whole series for the first time, or if you watched it once a long time ago and your memory of it is a little faded, then give this movie another chance.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
The weakest of all the Star Wars films,"The original Star Wars trilogy are properly 3 of the best loved films ever made and it is definitely one of the few film series as a whole where all 3 films are good. When George Lucas decided to revisit his creation with a prequel trilogy about how Anakin Skywalker became Darth Vader. There was even a cool poster of a young boy walking with his show being Darth Vader. The Phantom Menace was one of the most eagerly awaited of 1999.Set 32 years before the events Stars Wars Episode IV: A New Hope the Trade Federation are trying to put pressure on the Galactic Empire by blockading the planet of Naboo, because of the issue of taxation of trade. The Superme Chancellor sent two Jedi Knights, Qui-Gon Jinn (Liam Neeson) and Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) to resolve the issue. But they are unable to stop the Trade Federation invading the planet and the Jedi were forced to save Queen Amidala (Keira Knightley) and her court. This group are forced to go to the planet Tatooine where there are stuck. On that desert world they meet the young Anakin Skywalker (Jake Lloyd), a boy who is a slave with his mother. He is quickly befriended by the Amidala handmaiden Padme (Natalie Portman). Qui-Gon also sees that the child had extraordinary gifts with the force and sets out to free him from his serfdom.With nearly 16 years since the last Star Wars film and the film George Lucas directed for 22 years there was a lot of expectation on the Phantom Menace. But this prequel was never able to live up to it and this is the weakest out of all the live action Star Wars films. There are several reasons why this happened: a plot where there are weak reasons for why the bad guys don't fully expand their actions, too much inter-galactic politics which was not needed in a film for families, some very un-Star Wars like scenes like the two head commenter, weak acting, too-long running time and the biggest of them all Jar-Jar Binks. Lucas tries to defend Jar-Jar Binks because the films are aimed for children and he was meant to be a character for them: but he was just very annoying throughout the film and only the very youngest of children would have laughed at his antics. Some people are even suggested that Binks was a racial stereotype of Jamaican people, but at the very least he a misguided step by Lucas. It was also suggested that The Phantom Menace was a chance for Lucas to vent against his tax bill (he's rich he needs to accept that he is going to have a slightly higher level of taxation against him). Whether it's true or not the plot was fairly weak (and Star Wars isn't known for complex plots (yes I know Star Wars has complex themes)). They needed to be someone more visible, like the Trade Federation wanting power or control of a resource on Naboo. The politics was too much and something people couldn't really relate to. It could be suggested that it was influenced by the Roman Empire, but also very much like Republican views about Washington D.C. (not really the way to go). But then I'm just looking to much into it. Jack Lloyd was also a terrible casting choice, his acting was very weak and wooden and just not very good. He wasn't convincing as the young Anakin and some of the things he said like Yippee was annoying. Keira Knightley was also wooden in her role, but this was one of her first roles. But at least Liam Neeson was in the film and he was decent in his role.It isn't all doom and gloom with this film. The action scenes and special effects were excellent throughout the film and there was a lot of ambition when it came to design of alien species. Whilst the pod-racing did like look like it was computer game, the battle of Naboo was well done and the fight scene with Darth Maul was excellent. Darth Maul was a great creation as a villain and it's a shame that he wasn't given a lot more screen time.Whilst The Phantom Menace is far from being called a good movie, there are still moments to enjoy from it, particularly the final third. The second two films of the prequel trilogy were a lot better.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
The best kids movie in a long time,"Queueing up for tickets for the most eagerly awaited movie of all time I took a minute to look around at all the other people waiting in the queue, I do not think there were any children there. Do we all forget it is a children's movie, which is why we all loved the original movies when we were kids we all pretended to be Luke Skywalker and Han Solo in the back yard. 'The Phantom Menace' has a good story line, granted some of the dialogue in the film leaves much to be desired but allot of the dialogue in the original trilogy is the same. The effects are superb not on a par with 'Matrix' but not far behind. George Lucas could of made the movie a higher rated film and had lots of bloodshed but that is not the essence of star wars it is a children's fantasy film, it wasn't written for adults.

The title is perfect...,"Phantom: the story is vanishingly thin.Menace: five more films are planned.Those who love this movie loved it before they entered the theatre. Is there any chance that the uncommitted will be won over?A friend of mine who liked this movie justified his opinion thusly: ""Star Wars is all about dumb fun"".I never really saw it that way. It's true that Star Wars, front and center, is synonymous with ground-breaking special effects and white-knuckle adventure. However, the implausible thrills were always tempered with a higher sense of purpose, allegory, dare I say ""intellect""? Not exactly Woody-Allen-cerebral; never in your face, but always pervasive. You know what I'm talking about.With the present episode, the higher level has been stripped away, and the no-brainer elements are turned to eleven. If you are a moviegoer who demands theatrical devices such as plot and character development, you are likely to cringe your way through this movie. Two hours of tooth grinding and slapping yourself on the forehead may necessitate dental care and a trip to the neurologist. If, however, you have not yet reached puberty, or if ""dumb fun"" is your criteria for the Star Wars series, then put the grey matter in neutral and enjoy.For better or worse, this is what The Phantom Menace has to offer:1. FX, FX, and more FX... a computer generated graphic in every  frame. If the film has a salient strength, it is the exciting race and battle sequences courtesy of digital technology. Unfortunately, too much of the movie seems contrived as an excuse for the inclusion of special effects ""wizardry"". Also, in the ""everything is possible"" world of computer visuals, there is little need of ingenuity (required in the earlier movies). There is LOTS of grandiose, intricate, but ultimately sterile digital scenery. No one will ever scratch their head saying ""now, how did they do that""? A programmer was paid to make it happen. Finally, while digital characters replace the rubber-mask technology of yesteryear, there is the uneasy feeling that in ten years' time the digital ""Watto"" will be no more convincing than the rubber-masked ""Greedo"".2. Historical context for future episodes. But, ouch! Maybe it was better not to know? Attempts to lay political groundwork for the later episodes are weak, introduction of key players from later episodes weaker still. Less justifiable is the use of story elements that are inconsistent with the later episodes, such as a biological basis for The Force. I will concede that Lucas is a genius if he can tie up numerous inconsistencies introduced in this episode which do not hold true for the later episodes. Meanwhile, I'm not holding my breath.3. The story (?) is meandering at best, and at worst an excuse for stringing together a series of special effects scenes. It is hard to see the story as anything other than an afterthought, devised in the editing room after all of the scenes have been shot and/or programmed. Enjoyable if you are enthralled by the thwarting of a droid army takeover of a backward planet ruled by an overdressed child-queen, all thinly veiled as an embargo. ""Depth"" is ""achieved"" through frequent superficial religious references. Don't ask why. This is ""dumb fun"", remember?4. Characters old and new. The aforementioned emphasis on special effects leaves little time for character development. Yes, you will love Ben Kenobi in Star Wars- you may cry over his fate in that movie, but there is scant opportunity to love him at present. Likewise, you may fear his satanic visage, but given his paucity of screen time you'll never get to know the real Darth Maul. Who knows, maybe he's a sweetheart deep down (just like the more famous Darth)? Also, the silly computer generated characters (one in particular) will almost certainly irritate any viewer with a sense of discernment. On the other hand, said character finally introduces much-needed flatulence humor to the franchise. Isn't it about time?I can't recommend this movie. It is a one-trick-pony, where special effects are the be-all and end-all. Other aspects of theatrical storytelling are addressed grudgingly or ignored completely. The story rings false, and major players are either reduced to cameos (Samuel Jackson), undeveloped (Darth) or grating (you know who). Sorry George, I was willing to meet you half way, but you just couldn't put down the mouse. (Or the marketing textbook...)",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
New installment generally satisfying....worth the wait.,"I have seen it, and I am pleased.  I apologize if at some points, my comments seem a tad unenthusiastic, but the preceding hype help to numb the effects slightly of a brilliant first/fourth edition to a wonderful series of films. I dare say that die hard fans will find the basic structure of the movie quite familiar.   I argue that you would be correct in this assumption.Like ""A New Hope,"" the ""Phantom Menace"" serves to set the stage for an entire trilogy.  There is a plot, and some definite goals attained by our heroes- true.  However, the primary purpose of this movie is to introduce us to the characters that will be important for the rest of the trilogy.  We get to see young Anakin, and learn a little bit about how he started to use the force.  WE learn how Obi-Wan falls into this plan.  We meet the droids for the first time as well.  We also meet Palpatine at a much younger age as he begins his rise to power.  We also see Yoda and Jabba.In addition to the old favorites, we meet new characters, including the Queen (and her vast wardrobe), the wise and skilled Qui-Gon Jinn, Darth Maul ( and the Sith organization), Jar-Jar Binks (pure comic relief in my opinion, and a tad annoying at times), Watto the gambling junk dealer, Boss Nass of the Gungans, and the Jedi Council.  All of these characters are well acted, with especial credit due to Liam Neeson and Ewan Mcgregor.The effects are particularly nice, though they can only be truly appreciated after you think about them for a while, and the sheer magnitude of what it must have taken to coordinate them.  the space battle and pod racing scenes are extemely well done... and the CGI characters are masterfully inserted into the action.  (though I must admit that an occasional Jar-Jar scene is a bit jerky...)  The scenery and sets are magnificent... and I have to give a little credit to the freak that designed the vast wardrobe of the girl queen... they're at least ""different""All in all, he movie was very well done.  The dialogue is superbly written, and can be easily understood and appreciated by fans of all ages.  The story of the movie by itself is enough to keep the attention of the new fans, while much of the foreshadowing hidden throughout the film will greatly interest the die hard fanatic.  The effects, costumes, acting, and makeup come together almost flawlessly to form a great movie.  The soundtrack is pretty good, too.  I'm predicting a major tonnage at the box office this summer.  So, what are you waiting for, shouldn't you be in line already?P.S.  After watching the film, let me know if you don't think the closing scene is  at least vaguely familiar from somewhere.  I think you'll be pleased with the effect.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Imaginative, some problems with execution","After 16 years, the Starwars franchise was brought out of moth balls. This ambitious prequel achieves with inspired creativity at times, and stumbles with poorly conceived misguided ideas at other times.They gave it their best shot, though. It's just that many things simply didn't work. Jar-Jar is inserted for C3PO as the comic relief, and his constant whimpering of poorly scripted ""comic"" dialog in a high screech just gets on your nerves. The action sequences are occasionally sloppy and confusing. The kid playing young Anakin blandly recites lines like he's an extra in a kindergarten play. His scene of accidentally destroying something was pitifully contrived and stupid. Why do the rebels fight with primitive technology (catapaults) along with advanced devices (force field)? As for Natalie Portman, I like her acting but her character looks like an ad for the Forcianity religion: she's always got blood coming out of her lip like she bites her tongue a lot, and her hair looks like an inflated Goodyear Blimp landed on her head.But there's a lot of good to point out too. There was a lot of political intrigue, setting the groundwork for future events to be depicted in the two movies that were already anticipated when this was made. The Darth Maull light sabre battles were superior; probably the best of all six installments of the series. He was an interesting and deliciously menacing character for the Jedi to encounter. The future society backgrounds were creative, and the foundational back story of the Jedi Knights was integrated well. Special effects technology was splendidly utilized. This movie's futuristic take on the Ben Hur chariot race is a fine tribute to that classic sequence (although it does little to further the story).Lots of positives and negatives on this one. In later installments, they eliminated many of the weaknesses and improved the overall story.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
The plot is crap but Liam Neeson was awesome,"To be honest the Phantom Menace, didn't bring about the introduction I desired about the whole Stars Wars saga, but it was a nice movie by its own rights. The problem I believe is from the fact that George Lucas had all the rights to wheel and drive this movie how he pleases, that with no one questioning him, this I believe is the reason I had to deal with 2 hours or less of Jar Jar Binks, who wasn't funny but annoying and his clan was so annoying that I wished the droids wiped them out before young Anakin Skywalker could save them.Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn (Liam Neeson) and his apprentice Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) were the high side of this movie, I was extremely impressed by the portrayal of Qui-Gon Jinn to the point that I just wanted to be seeing Liam Neeson at all times, he was just magnificent and made the movie worth seeing and his presence made it easier to deal with the annoying Character of Jar Jar Binks and his clan.Star Wars Episode 1: The Phantom Menace is the forth film in the Star Wars saga, it came about from Lucas planning a back story that will connect and give a story depth between Darth Vader and Luke Skywalker, in the first Star Wars trilogy Vader is said to be Luke's father so this second trilogy is to show how Anakin (Darth Vader) was trained and swayed to the dark side. The movie main protagonist will be Anakin Skywalker, and this first movie of the sequel will be his introduction.The name Phantom Menace depicts Palpatine hiding his true identity as the evil Sith Lord. The movie follows the adventure of Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn and his apprentice Obi-Wan Kenobi as they were to escort and protect the Queen Amidala (Natalie Portman) of planet Naboo as she travels to Coruscant as she hopes to end the trade dispute between her people and the Viceroy. Their Journey wasn't a peaceful one as the Viceroy invaded Naboo and they had to flee. During their flight a breakdown of their space craft causing them to land in the planet Tatooine where they met young Anakin Skywalker and also witnessed the return of the Sith, as Qui-Gon Jinn had to defend himself from one.The CGI in the movie is not as impressive as I will expect and but the screenplay is one that will keep the interest of many, this massive box office hit was received with many mixed reviews and I myself have mixed feelings about the movie. It will be a lot easier to enjoy this movie if you have seen the first trilogy, don't try to watch the movie from here up hoping to get the feel.In conclusion, Star Wars is a wonderful franchise a movie plot that can go on and on, I did enjoy this movie but not because of the script or plot which were a 5/10 from my view but because of the performance of Liam Neeson and Ewan McGregor.www.lagsreviews.com",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Not a great movie but good all the same,First off i wish everyone would leave this movie alone. OK yeah its not as good as episodes 4-6 and Jar Jar Bink's just needs a punch in the face but lets just forget about all that. Instead lets look at the good points. The start of this movie is amazing. Up until Obi-wan and Qi-gon go down to Naboo. Then OK yeah its starts to suck a lot and the less said about the pod race the better. But when you get over that you have to see that Qi gon jinn is one of the best Jedi in any of the movies. And Darth Maul is just amazing. I just wish i could go back in time (like almost every star wars fan) meet up with George Lucas and make him re-write almost all of it and for god sake don't kill Darth Maul! Come to think of it what was the point in doing that? He could have done the same job as Dooku and done it better in episode 2. Rant over,6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Movie, Star Wars, Entertaining","Well,  what to say about this film.It was way over hyped.  I mean there is no way this movie (or any movie) could have lived up to all the stupid hype it's gotten.I loved the movie!  It was a great setup for the next two.  the FX are awesome, and the acting is just as good as it was in the first Star Wars.I have to feel sorry for poor Ewen.  He had some BIG shoes to fill! Critics are hacking the poor guy to bits.  I mean what are these guys looking for?  Obiously he can't be what Alec Guinness (Mr. Was-nominated-for-best-supporting-actor-in-first-Star-Wars).  Ewen does an excellent job of being a young Obi-Wan.My only complaint about Episode I was that the plot should have been expanded a little bit more, but what I forgot (and most other people) was that the original Star Wars didn't develop characters all that much, and the plot was rather simple.  It WAS a fun movie to watch.  I loved Episode I.  It was and is a fun movie to watch :).",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Honestly a bad start for the series, but still has good moments","I have seen this movie twice in theaters. Once when I was a kid, and now again in 3D. The visuals were very nice, and I know they were amazing when it first came out because I remember being greatly impressed by them, and seeing the movie in 3D was pretty nice. The problem that this movie has is that it throws logic out the window and starts to become a kids movie.One of the biggest flaws with this movie is that it seems very goofy compared to the others. There are comedy reliefs around every corner, lame puns flying everywhere, and a very lighthearted mood. The plot is supposed to be centered around a conflict on Naboo, yet we never see the conflict. Supposedly thousands of people are dying, people are starving, and just disasters everywhere. But when we see Naboo it looks perfectly fine, we see no one dying, we don't even see anyone injured! Actually we don't even see ANYONE! They just say that bad things are happening.Jar Jar Binks is not as bad of a character as people make him to be, but he is still fairly annoying. The entire Gungan people was just a little bit too silly. Their underwater city was cool but made little sense seeing as how it is in a swamp.The lightsabre action was actually really good in this movie. Compared to the other movies the lightsabre duels were much better. While they may not have been as fancy or epic, the actual choreography was good. Darth Maul was cool, though I think he needed a bit more face time.The podracing scene was probably the best scene in the entire movie. It was very enjoyable and cool. The only problem I had with Tatooine is that some of the aliens make no sense. Like one alien was literally a giant cartoony head with arms and legs. There were a couple others that didn't seem right.Overall an okay movie, but I feel like it could've been so much better if the plot were taken a bit more seriously, and if the characters were fleshed out a bit more. Still enjoyable to watch for nostalgia's sake.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Ehhh, okay.","I know and agreed that Stars Wars is a movie of its time and is one of the best fiction stories around. Stars Wars took us to another place or generation we didn't even know existed. But don't you think each new episode is getting kind of dull now. I must say Stars Wars is a great story, truly an ""A+"", but as the ""series"" continue, I'm wondering when it will end, but happy to know I will be watching the two upcoming episodes because Hayden Christensen is in it. He's my favorite actor.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
A lot Better then People give it Credit for,"I'll be the first to admit that The Phantom Menace (TPM from here on in)is not a perfect film, but there is no way it deserves the thrashing it gets in the media.TPM is a very good film, and George Lucas is brilliant man who despite what many have said has not lost his directing skills over the years. He presents the story of Anakin Skywalker (Darth Vader) in his his youth and how he is discovered by Jedi Qui-Gon Jinn and brought to the capital planet of Corruscant to begin his Training.  To make the film more exiting and to introduce new characters, the Film also deals with a Trade dispute involving The planet of Naboo and the Trade Federation, which serves as the final battle in the film.I can't believe how bashed this film gets, yes its not as good as the original trilogy, but TPM is much better than the ""over CGI Video-game"" looking Attack of the clones(AOTC). The performances are very well done, Ewan MacGregor has minimum screen time, but he does fine as does Natalie Portman, Jake Lloyd and Liam Neeson (who is the star of the film), The CGI is just the right amount for the film, its not fake looking or over used as AOTC showed us and the Story is very interesting, this film takes place before the Empire as taken over in the Original Trilogy and before the clone war conflict of AOTC, so this is the only Star Wars film to show us what the galaxy was like during peaceful times.Also, it should be viewed with an open mind, Don't sit down to watch this film expecting to learn every secret and hidden meaning in the other Star wars films (that will be left to AOTC and episode 3). Enjoy it for what it is, a fun adventure film that sets up the events in the following 5 films.8/10 stars",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"crude, foolish soporific","Lucas has spent 20 years perfecting the technology and forgotten that the film needed a script.The ""characters"" are slapped together from the offcuts of 40s melodrama. Jah Jah Binks is pathetic, a sorry version of a comedy negro in the Butterfly McQueen tradition. The heroes are given wild costumes, when they should be given thoughtful lines. This film is all look and no substance. Don't waste your time with it.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
A lot of missing the point going on...,"One of the main criticisms of TPM is that the story is confusing and the characters are not very two-dimensional.  I read a (rather over-excited) review of Episode II on the web yesterday, the author of which promises us all that AOTC will make more sense of the events in TPM.  This seems to be missing the point.All that is wrong with this movie is that it is very poorly directed.  It has no centre, only a 'vision' in its most literal sense - ie. Lucas sees his milieux in two dimensions, visually and historically.  He seems incapabale of imbuing his - admittedly very impressive and cohesive - universe with any real life.  The universe of the first two films had a sense of completeness, it had <character>.  This new version has no soul.Lucas' problem is that he knows the story but no longer possesses the discipline to tell it properly.  It is not that the characters are two-dimensional, but rather than the creative core of the film - the director - seems to be unable to help the actors breathe life into what they have.  So you end up with the veterans doing a good job (Neeson, McDiarmid, Jackson) and the kids coming across as flat (Portman, Lloyd), because the experienced cast members know how to get on with the job.Secondly, the pacing of this film is atrocious.  The editing is technically fine, but the structuring of scenes - and the movement from one scene to the next - is clumsy and confusing.  Characters suddenly arrive out of nowhere, the editing seeming to rely on what the audience is forced to assume is coincidence in the narrative.  Alternatively, the director assumes that we are following and are happy to go with him.  This is not so - at least not here.This film <is> a Star Wars movie because the universe it portrays contains all the necessary symbols and it looks amazing.  Its only problem is that its director lacks the maturity to ""let go"" - George Lucas should have stuck to imagining and producing the movie and universe and left the story-telling up to some one with a surer hand, someone who knows how to tell a story rather than simply <show> us a story.  Let's hope Lucas has learned his lesson and that Episode II truly works.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Unquestionably the low point of the series,"The original Star Wars trilogy was ground-breaking in its day and attracted millions of loyal fans worldwide. So, expectations were understandably high for the first entry in the prequel trilogy. Unfortunately, rather than witnessing a new benchmark in cinematic greatness, moviegoers were instead subjected the debacle that is ""The Phantom Menace"".Where to begin with the film's problems? For starters, most of the blame rests on the shoulders of George Lucas. Taking over the series' directorial duties for the first time since the original film, he also wrote the script & acted as executive producer. Arguably spreading himself too thin, this also put him in a position where there was no-one to seriously challenge his sometimes questionable choices for the film.Most infamously, the presence of supposedly humorous character Jar Jar Binks was a sore spot for the vast majority of viewers. Reminiscent of a bygone racist caricature, practically everything the character says or does is a source of annoyance. As an attempt at replicating the kind of comic relief supplied by C-3PO & R2-D2 in the original films, Jar Jar Binks is a spectacular failure.Binks is also a prime example of computer generated imagery run amok. Prefiguring some of today's most elaborate special effects extravaganzas, the movie is plastered with often garish CGI environments & characters. Rudimentary as they sometimes were, the special effects of the original trilogy nevertheless felt more real than these more technologically ambitious visuals.The issues with the acting & the script go hand in hand. Apart from the always dependable Liam Neeson, the acting is wooden and unconvincing. Nothing much could reasonably be expected from 10-year old Jake Lloyd but talented co-stars Natalie Portman & Ewan McGregor were hamstrung by uninteresting characterizations and stilted dialogue. Fortunately, both actors turned in better performances in the later movies. Another point of contention, for me at least, is that Jake Lloyd seems absolutely nothing like the older portrayal of Anakin in the 2nd & 3rd movies, courtesy of Hayden Christensen.Despite being critically maligned, the movie still managed to snag three Oscar nominations; for sound, sound effects editing & visual effects, all difficult to argue with on their own merits. Also on the bright side, the movie sported a score from John Williams which elaborated on his iconic themes from the earlier movies. However, it's telling that almost all of the movie's strengths lie in technical areas as opposed to crucial elements like acting & story.Is ""The Phantom Menace"" one of the worst films ever made? Not quite. Is it a colossal disappointment, particularly considering its pedigree? Certainly. The prequel trilogy did get progressively better as it went along but this initial entry is almost painful to watch. Kids will probably be much more receptive to it but fans of the original trilogy should only see it for the sake of completeness.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
The first of the worst or the last of the best?,"The Phantom Menace is considered to be the worst Star Wars movie. Unfortunately, it is, but that doesn't make it a bad movie.The story begins with the two Jedi ambassadors, Qui-Gon Jinn (Liam Neeson) and Obi-Wan Kenobie (Ewan McGregor), who have come to negotiate with the Trade Federation, rising power which now controls a number trade routes. The negotiations fail and the two Jedi are forced to flee to the planet below - Naboo. There they save the queen, Amidala (Natalie Portman), and her loyal helpers, while the Trade federation takes control of the planet. On their way to Coruscant, the only place where Amidala can get help, the group encounters a boy, Anakin Skywalker (Jake Lloyd), who seems to have Jedi powers. Meanwhile, a Sith, Darth Maul , has been sent to hunt them down.To be honest, the plot is good - the battle with corruption, a little boy with ""great expectations"", the battle for freedom - it's a standard, solid story. But there are flaws.Let me list you the only good characters/w actors in the movie - Darth Maul, Qui Gon, Shmi Skywalker, The Emperor.Four good characters in the whole movie! Darth Maul is one of the most intimidating, strong and devoted Sith you will ever see in Star Wars. Qui Gon is, believe it or not, the best Jedi in the saga. Now, before you start arguing, remember what leads to the dark side and what qualities a Jedi must have. A Jedi must never use his anger and never fear anything. This is the only Jedi in the whole saga (along with Ben Kenobi) who managed to be a perfect Jedi - always calm, never fearful, never panicking, wise. But he is a bit weak... You'll see the other two for yourself.Now, for some flaws. Many alien characters have accents that are basically inspired or resemble actual people, like Jar-Jar, the clumsy and brainless Gungan, who resembles, it seems, someone from the Caribbean. The same could be said for Watto and Nute Gunray.Jake Lloyd is the most hated actor in the movie. I agree that his acting is terrible, but I don't blame the boy, no. I blame someone else *cough* Lucas *cough*, who had to choose between 3000 kids, among which were even well-known ones, but chose Jake.Queen Amidala is such a wooden character, she barely moves, her face barely moves and she has such a ridiculous wardrobe. Who should be blamed? Portman plays Padme as well, and this character is a bit better, not by much. Obi Wan is a notable character...in the next movies, but not here. He is in the back plan, but some moments.There is no character development, some moments are pointless and there is way, way too much CGI. Okay, the visuals are stunning, but it feels artificial.Many complain about Jar-Jar, but they are forgetting that he had two crucial uses in the movie, which I will not spoil. If he had no more dialogue than what I mentioned, he would not be annoying.Despite the flaws, Episode I feels like Star Wars, with the trademark music and visual effects. It has some incredible scenes, like the Pod Race, the saber battles (with splendid choreography, some Qui-Gonn-Anakin/Obi-Wan dialogues and the final battles. It was a disappointment for the people who were used to the original movies, but now we're used to it.Overall, the movie is good. It's like a new car: looks nice, but it's full of bird droppings.Final Score: 3/5 or 6/10.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Pretty good, but kind of corny","I thought it had a great story to it, but I didn't like a lot of the corny dialogue that was meant to state the obvious for the kiddies. I understand that Star Wars is for kids and always has been, but this is a lot more juvenile than the original three. I have to say I hated Jar Jar Binks and would've loved the movie if he wasn't in it. He was annoying and I hope he gets killed off in the next one. THEN, I'll wait in line for a long time. The special effects were incredible as expected, and I thought the lightsaber duels were far superior to the originals. Overall a pretty good movie, I like the way Lucas alludes to Anakin's future demise into the dark side and all of the other subtle references to the next episodes. I have a good feeling that the next two will be far superior to this film and will break new ground in film-making (beyond even this one.)",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
So much better than I first thought.,"I'm giving 10 stars to counterbalance what I think are unfair reviews. This movies probably a 9 maybe an 8.I grew up as a huge fan of the original trilogy, and when I saw this in theaters I felt pretty neutral. I didn't hate it, but it just didn't give me the feeling that I felt when I watched OG Star Wars for the first time. I guess that's been the problem with everything since the original trilogy. George Lucas has been a victim of his own success. Could anything have really lived up to the originals? I don't think so. But going back now, I love this trilogy. It enhances episodes 4-6 in a way that I didn't first realize. The plots, the characters, and the acting are not as abysmal as people claim. Jake Loyd, Jar Jar Binks they're great! And everyone who disagrees is bantha pudu. Y'all just need to lighten up and learn to have a little fun with things. The Jedi Order may be a type of religion, but the movies aren't. Relax.

An Insult to the Trilogy,"George Lucas' Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace does not work. It is not a product of its times, and it fails as an attempt to recapture the concepts that made the original trilogy a product of its times. It is not simple, but is instead complex to the point of muddiness, and cannot be appreciated without an extensive knowledge of Star Wars trivia. It is an imitation, while the beauty of Star Wars lies in its uniqueness and novelty. The weakness of the characterization allows special effects and action to take center stage, thus shifting the film into the less timeless realm of sci-fi. While it has its own brand of ""feel of the old,"" this is a brand that denies the fresh, raw, and exciting elements of the frontier feel of the original trilogy. What is more, Episode I's ""feel of the old"" forces technology to the forefront, pressing backwards the crucial elements of man and magic. Even Couresant, which has the most potential for conveying a sense of mystery and for avoiding technology's alienation of men, fails to develop sufficiently to restore these elements of man and magic. Lucas' choice to create a more polished film does away with any remaining remnants of raw feeling, and the acting unfortunately assists in the relegation of men to second seat, behind technology. Only Liam Neeson turns in the performance that a film bearing the name of Star Wars truly deserves. All of these elements thus force the visual elements of the film-special effects and costuming-to the forefront, denying the actual substance that should support the work. Episode I is a big show of inappropriate glitz and glamor-just what Star Wars, The Empire Strikes Back, and The Return of the Jedi avoided being-without much to back it up, and without innovation. It thus falls into the trap of becoming just what the original trilogy was noteworthy for breaking from: a sci-fi flick. Finally, the beauty of the original trilogy as a unit suspended between unmade trilogies makes the completion of Episode I sacrilege.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Will anyone watch this for pleasure in 10 years?,"Hey, blindly loyal Star wars fans who have posted your love for this movie here: just what exactly do you see in this movie that will draw you back again and again as the first movie did?  The kid's all-thumbs acting?  The completely undeveloped relationship between Jedi master and apprentice?  The dull, unscary villains?  The human warmth of the scenes in which the kid leaves his mom forever without even a goodbye?  Trying to figure out which one is the queen dressed as her servant and which one is the servant dressed as the queen dressed as the servant (like it matters)?  Watching the best years of Ewan Mcgregor's career be wasted talking bilge about midi-chronthians or whatever they were?This is shockingly inept filmmaking, illogical even on its own terms-- Jedis blather so much about sensing the force, but Obli-Da can't sense a Dark Lord coming up behind him on a scooter-- and bad at everything we used to go to movies for (and even got a little from Lucas's early movies).  Lucas plainly doesn't know that what made the originals enjoyable was the presence of a character mocking the whole business (Han Solo); now he takes himself as seriously as those dull Star Wars imitations (Krull, The Dark Crystal, etc.) that followed in his wake.  There is nothing in this frantic, pompous kiddie adventure movie to suggest that he will be capable of handling the more serious themes of Annakin's temptation and corruption that are implicit in where the next two films will go-- you might as well ask the director of the Pokemon movie to do Godfather IV.  I look to the hype surrounding the next two movies with nothing but dread.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"No matter what, I will always love the Prequel Trilogy","Despite the negative reviews this movie seems to get - I still love it. I've heard others refer to it as the worst SW movie, but I disagree. Everyone is entitled to their own opinion though.In ""The Phantom Menace"", we meet Anakin Skywalker, a boy who is clearly guided by his heart and extremely fearful of loss. We meet younger Obi Wan Kenobi, who is rather cynical and very ""by the book"" like the rest of the arrogant Jedi Council. Even though he was only in one of the movies, Qui Gon Jinn's role is so important as well. He's the father figure Anakin Skywalker needed and didn't truly believe in the dogmatic ways of the Jedi Council. Queen Amidala is a hopeful politician whose boldness even surprised Darth Sidious. Dart Maul doesn't have too many speaking parts, but his character is redeemed later.TPM also gives us a glimpse of the toxic politics that eventually lead up to the collapse of the galactic republic. Senator Palpatine is also great in this movie - the way he manipulated Queen Amidala & the Trade Federation to further his secret agenda is really quite brilliant. A 14 year old queen crying about the plight of her people is likely to get sympathy from the senate, which is exactly what Palpatine wanted in order depose Valorum and take control as Chancellor. Jar Jar Binks was easily manipulated too (I will not hate on Jar Jar in this review). In Phantom Menace, we can clearly see how inefficient AND corrupt the galactic senate can be - and important plot element of the Prequels. The Pod Race scene was awesome. And say what you will, the Battle on Naboo was pretty cool too!So many criticize the Prequel movies for being too political - but that's the point. Somehow, a galactic democracy collapsed which gave us the repressive dictatorship we saw in the Original Trilogy (and Rebels). The Phantom Menace is a great starting point for that story. Is it action packed and filled with space battles every minute? No - but it has exciting moments and tells a great story. Some like this movie and some don't - I am a fan who does love this movie and everything it offers.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Silent film references,"Boy, what a dud, eh? And I had been told not to expect very much. The theatre here in Toronto was nearly empty. I guess the word has gone around already.But at least the occasional silent film references may encourage people to investigate some older films of greater merit.The scene of the blue globes rolling past that irritating Ja-Ja-Jamaican character is from the climax of Buster Keaton's ""Seven Chances"" (1925). In Buster's case, the globes are boulders and the scene is actually funny. Very funny in fact.The city scene at the end of this film is clearly modelled after the Babylonian set in D.W. Griffith's ""Intolerance"" (1916), while the look of the capital planet is taken from Fritz Lang's ""Metropolis"" (1927). Most people, I think, would have noticed the latter. It's the outward visible sign -- ""In hoc signo vinces"" -- that any references you think you're seeing are, in fact, 1) real, and 2) intentional.The pod race, of course, derives from Gen. Wallace's ""Ben Hur"". I choose to believe it's Fred Niblo's 1926 version with Ramon Novarro that's being referenced, superior I think to the Wyler / Heston remake. Most people who've seen both prefer the original, although the second one does have its strengths too.For a change of pace, there was that sound film reference -- the sound film has really been catching on, I hear -- that little group of E.T.'s that you see briefly in the Senate chamber. That was cute, a little unexpected. And two seconds worth of ""E.T."" is about all I can tolerate anyway, so it was just right. A pinch of cuteness, no more.I have been avoiding the hype about this movie as much as has been humanly possible. Perhaps some publicity has mentioned these homages, perhaps not. In any case, they are pretty clear to greying members of the audience.Not paying attention to the pre-publicity may have been a mistake however. The filmmaker assumes you've seen it so he doesn't have to give you any basic information. For example, what was the main character's name? Liam Neeson's? After the screening, I stopped into the bookshop next door where I learned the name of the lead character in the film I'd just seen! Thank goodness for neighbourhood bookstores.I should also state for the record the most obvious point about the movie, its argument in favour of the current Canadian parliamentary system. Where senators don't have any real actual power to use and abuse. Members of those of Her Majesty's opposition parties who are plotting Senate ""reform"", please note: See this movie! See it now!And thank you, George, for your firm support for the constitutional status quo here in Canada! We appreciate it!",2.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
You will not be disappointed.,"Whenever a movie is this heavily anticipated, we wonder if it can live up to the expectations. Well, this one does.It's a ""Star Wars"" movie.

It was okay,"The movie was okay although the whole fight scene with Darth Maul made the movie.  I was one of the people who saw the movie on the first day, 12:01AM showing.  Although I will say this much, unlike some people who stayed in line all day, I stood in line for about fifteen minutes, was told that the movie sold out, then told that there was a drawing being held, lost the drawing, then had my Mother go up to the lady passing out winning tickets and had her ask for two tickets in which the lady said okay.  And I am happy this I got in that way because I would have been upset having waited for so long and paid money for that.Don't get me wrong, but I was not to happy with the movie itself.  It seemed rushed and the plot didn't work for me.  They spent too much time focusing on Jar Jar Binks and his dopey running and falling down bit, and not enough on the story and the characters.  I wanted to know more about Darth Maul, let's get more information about why the blockade was surrounding the planet, lets focus more about Darth Sideous and how he it into the grand scheme(as if most of us don't know, but I still think it would be good to have that in the movie) what about the relationship between the Gungan's (did I spell that right?) and the Naboo, why are they enemies, and if they are not enemies, why are they separated like that.  Those are things that could have been focused on, not Jar Jar sticking his tounge out at everyone. What about Anikin, why not focus on his fears, why is he so angry, we need that for the back story for Darth Vader's birth.  Give us just a little more information on the corruption in the Senate.  What about the head of the Senate, why is he corrupt?  These are things that needed to be focused on. Sword fights, battles and special effects don't make the movie.  The space battle should have been just a little bit more intense at least focusing in a little on the pilots and seeing a few of them get killed and shoot down some of the enemy fighters and throw out some flight lingo.  That's what made the space fights so cool in the previous movie.We take a look at some of the earlier movies and you got to see the emotional feelings the major characters had.  We got to see Luke Skywalker's life, how he wanted more but was being held back.  He wanted a life of adventure whereas  his uncle wanted  him on the farm.  We see Han Solo as the selfish smuggler who only worries about two things, himself and money. But you also saw another part in him, the brave side, risking his life by running down the Stormtroopers while Skywalker and the Princess made their escape.  We get the impression that Princess Leia is a very strong person who is also a very high ranking person in the rebellion.  We learn things about the characters along the way.  Solo's debt with Jaba the Hut. Princess Leia cover as diplomat being blown, her home planet being destroyed.  We find she is a very determined woman who will not betray her friends even under torture.  We really don't learn too much about C-3P0, R2-D2 and Chewbacca untill the next movie and as for Darth Vader, we can see that this is the man.  Don't mess with him, he is very powerful.  You learn about Obi Wan Kinobi and how he trained Luke's Father and fought with him during the wars and get a glimse of what happened to Luke's Father.In the next movie, Lando Calressian appears, and even though he isn't in the movie very long, we learn a little about him.  We know he is a friend of Han Solo, the Millenium Falcon was his, he is an expert con artist and won control of Cloud City through a gambling debt.   We know enough that he has lead an adventurous life and that he is a very brave person.  Lando is one of the few characters to ever confront Vader with a verbal assault and one of the few people who double cross Vader when the deal goes sour to rescue his friends.  Boba Fett arrives.  Not much is given on his character, but the man is good and we can see he is very clever.  Admiral Piett enters into the movie and we see him go from a regular command officer to the commanding officer, a promotion that causes him serious emotional problems due to fear of failing Vader.This was character development.  These characters were well developed from the start even though they did not have much screen time.  The characters in this movie seem to just appear.  We know little of the history of Qui Gon Jin except that he has had problems inside the Jedi Counsil.  Obi Wan is just a pupil, Anikin is upset about being a slave, and as for the Queen, we know that she is strong individual who can take charge.  But nothing above that.  There are other important characters who jump in and that's it. Captain Panaka is just there as the body guard, Ric Ollie is there as a fighter pilot.  We have Senator Palpatine who gets control of the Senate about the end of the movie.  What about Boss Nass.  What about the Queen's body guard.  What about Anikin's Mother.  There needed to be more development of some of these characters and more storyline around all the cast members and especially more around the real major characters.  Let's pull them out a little and make them characters, not people on screen reading lines.Star Wars: The Phantom Menace was okay, but it needed a lot of work.  This will be my least favorite episode so far.  I hope things get better because I really want to enjoy this series.  By the way, I think I miss spelled some of the names on this review.

"A Sweet Morsal of Disappointment with a ""Happy Meal"" Aftertaste","So, Mr. Lucas, the Trilogy is a Critical, Fan, and Commercial Success...But what can You do for an Encore?16 Years Later, the Director/Writer Answered that Question and the Reveal was, at best, a Pretty Sight but Critical and Fan Approval was Not a Pretty Sight Indeed, in Fact, it was Pretty Ugly.Although a Commercial Blockbuster, Earning 4 Times its Budget at the Box Office in its Initial Run, and the Toy and Product Dollars Enormous, Lucas Disappointed by the Movie on Completion, nevertheless, had to Live with His Creation, No Matter.Surprisingly Empty Considering the Depth of the Original Trilogy, the Anemia of the Movie is Apparent and Appalling. The Ghost of Joseph Campbell Haunts the Film and is Forever causing Outbursts from Depressed Viewers of all Types.Truth Be Told, the Movie could Hardly Live Up to its Predecessors and the Hype. Expectations were so Acute, Deeply Held, and Anticipatory that when the ""Man Behind the Curtain"" Revealed Himself Delivering a ""Toy Commercial"" at Worst and a Spectacle of SFX at Best, the Demystification was Complete.Lucas can Blame Only Himself for most of the Demystifying. What with the Evil Darth Vader Revealed as a Cute as a Button 7 Year Old with absolutely No Indication of a ""Dark Side"", all Wide Eyed and Family Friendly and ""The Force"" Reduced to a Microscopic Slide for Analysis the Writing was Not Only On the Wall, but so Bad it made even the Illiterate Wince and Cringe.The Movie is Not as Awful as the Initial Backlash would have You Believe, but it is Far From Great. It is an Entertaining Exercise in Excruciating Frustration.There are Moments of Visual Wonder and Excitement on Top of Tantalizing and Ultimately Fantastic but Futile Eye Candy that Sweetens the Product but the Aftertaste is, after all, Reminiscent of a ""Happy Meal"".",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"A Complicated Story, but once u understand it, u realise the magic of Star Wars!!!!!!!!!","Dear readersBeing the prequel to the Greatest ever Movie Series can be a very difficult task because people will have huge expectations & each and every scene of the movie will be observed under a microscope, i.e. Any minor mistake will be caught. This will magnify even very minor mistakes. I am neither going to say that the movie is great or bad .... nor i am going to give any description on its story. I am sure all of u have seen this movie. The movie has great characters (queen,anakin,darth maul,obi-wan etc.).The story has a meaning and u really need to see and understand the movie carefully. If u haven't, then following are the reasons why u should see this movie:1)it creates a sense of imagination in your mind. It takes u away from your everyday life and makes u realise that there is something else then just this planet. The movie makes you feel happy .2) The movie spreads the most important message in life : ""there is always a temptation to follow the easiest route in life ,but one must make sure that the route u follow should not harm the life of anyone else. I mean lets be honest, every person has a dark side .But one must overcome his/her greed. Its true that are many people out there who don't have what they want the most, but it doesn't give u the right to blame others for it. Sometimes the luck isn't on our side. But remember that if u escape the dark side of life then u will die happily, without any regrets.3)Star Wars instills the faith that there is something supernatural in this world and the bad guys will always lose in the end. The movie encourages you to be on the good side of life.4)One of the good things about the ""star wars trilogy & Phantom Menace"" is, that it gets you involved in the story and that makes it easier for u to understand the difference between the dark side and the good side. The movie is like a story that fires your imagination.5)It also says that unity is important for survival. Most modern movies are based on a super hero saving the world or rescuing a hijacked plane ,bus etc , BUT in Star Wars its Different. After u see the movie u will realise that although Luke Skywalker and Obi Wan Kanobi had the supernatural powers , they couldn't save the people single handedly. They needed the help of normal guys like Hansolo ,the rebel members,the water species etc.6) one of the best things of star wars is, that its background music relates to the story in a brilliant manner. The movie is well made and well acted. The characters are well portrayed. The locations and the creativity(like the Revolving Senate) are truly fantastic.In the end ,the answer to the question""how good the movie is?"" depends on how well u understand it.Mean while , May the Force be with U , Always....khabc.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
This Movie is a Phantom Menace,"As a big Starwars fan i can't help feel disappointed with this installment of the StarWars prequel., It lacks emotion character development and serious acting. Too comical for a Starwars film even if it was intended for kids. Apart from this and Jar Jar, and whats the deal with Boss Nass and his slobbering. Although Visual were stunning. The Saber duels at times were filmed to close. Altogether one Big Opppps!!",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
My first Star Wars movie and I love it to this day !.,"I don't understand so much negatives to JAR JAR BINKS. I like the way George Lucas made this movie. This World is so magick and the soundtrack i so wonderful. I like the story and I like the characters. I think The Phantom Menace has the best lightsaber fight scenes ever made in the Star Wars history. I still love episode 4,5,6 as well as 1,2,3. Pod racing is the one of the best action scene ever made to this day. Qui-Gon Jinn is my favorite Jedi ever ;]. Did I say anything about beautiful soundtrack.WoooW just WooooW. So bad George Lucas will never make any new Star Wars ever. In the end I hate episode 7 ;]. JJ.Abrams Star Wars is like Star Trek in the space.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Great to see Lucas back but what happened to the story,"The special effects were great but the story and characters were lacking. I love the Star Wars trilogy but I think Lucas missed on this one.  He was so busy trying to amaze us with the special effects that he forgot that the most important part of a movie is still the story line and characters.  The fight scene between Darth Maul, Qui-Gon Jinn and Obi-Wan Kenobi was amazing but did anyone really care who died?  Now think back when Han Solo was frozen in carbonite or when Luke and Vader were fighting only to find out it was a father and son fighting.  In the New Hope we found ourselves really liking the characters because they were interesting, more developed, and had interesting dialogue.  In the Phantom Menace it seemed Lucas just assumed we would like the characters. Also Darth Vader was way more scaring then Darth Maul, of course that might have to do with the fact I was eight when I first saw Vader but hey who else had his own scary music and choked a person with his mind.  Too cool.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
4 years later and critics still are harping on Phantom Menace.,"OK its 2003.  4 years after the Phantom Menace and still the critics are harping on Episode 1.  Now it may not have been the best film ever made or even the best Star Wars film but it is by far not the worst sequel ever made as E online would have you to believe.  It even beat out BATMAN AND ROBIN for the dubious honor.  BATMAN AND ROBIN is a film where everyone involved deserved to be locked away for there total lack of effort and respect towards the source material, from the acting to the writing to the set design, to the direction.Now when I went to see Episode 1 I wasn't let down because I was skeptical going into the film.  With all the buzz and all the interviews Lucas was giving back in 1999 I had already written off Phantom Menace as some half-baked predecessor to the original films and one which all the bandwagon people would jump for the joy because it would have nothing but neat computer effects like the Matrix.  I also got thrown for a loop in 1999 because all of a sudden it was cool to like Star Wars.  While Lucas does prefer good visuals over good dialogue I still felt that a story was being told, all be it a little jumbled.  And yes even though I find things in the Phantom Menace that cause me to roll my eyes it does not make me hate the film like all the bandwagon fans and critics out there do.I have no problem in saying that I admire George Lucas and what he is continuing to do with the Star Wars franchise.  He didn't sell out to all the sci-fi geeks who wanted to see Star Wars turn into Star Trek and managed to keep the films enjoyable fantasy for all ages especially concerning the love story.  I like the fact that Anakin and Padme get married in the second film instead of just falling in love and having the twins out of wedlock.As for other high profile films' whose sequels failed to live up the hype and were not on that worst sequel list. How about Star Trek 3, 5, and Nemesis and the Matrix Reloaded.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Could have been better, but still very good","Okey, now TPM may not be the best of the Star Wars series, but still offers rare treats to both old and new fans. The DVD is especially good, with its extras, and nice to watch on a quiet, rainy Sunday.The story goes like this:The greedy Trade Federation has decided to show off their trading skills and invade a lush planet Naboo and harrass the inhabitants, and the snooty Queen Amidala. Two Jedi - Qui Gon Jinn and his apprentice Obi-Wan Kenobi - are hired to settle it with the Federation. But the negotiations fail due to their indentity being revealed much too soon by a nosey droid and all hell breaks loose on the spaceships. But our brave heros escape after battling droids and sneak aboard a ship that flies to Naboo where they reunite, thanks to the help of a clumsy Gungan called Jar Jar Binks.I could go on and on, but you all know the story plot by now. I think the movie was perfect but one small problem... they should have really improved the script, and get the charactors to put more emotion in their voices and body language. I know Queen Amidala is supposed to be a cold person who responds softly, but even that she could have put more effort into it, so the future mother of Luke and Leia Skywalker wouldn't be so dislikable. But the costumes are great, I can tell you that!The DVD, as I mentioned before, is great and RECOMMENDED for any true Star Wars fan... this is my 2nd favourite Star Wars movie (next to ""Return of the Jedi"")6/10 *four points lost due to wooden actingBye",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Needs to be viewed a second time to get full impact of it.,"Upon my initial viewing I was very disappointed and let down by  what Mr. Lucas had put up on the screen. I don't want to sound repetitive, but most of the negative reviews found in the major daily papers across North America were right and I agreed whole heartedly with them. However, upon a second viewing I found the film not to be as flat and devoid of the rich Star Wars layers we've all come to know and love, rather, I found a lot more subtlety, complexity and humanity. Jar Jar is still annoying, don't get me wrong, the film still has problems, but they're minor in comparison to viewing the picture as the first chapter of a six part series. Anyway, these comments have been left for those of you who didn't like it...I suggest you see it again, you may gain a new perspective.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Better than I thought....,"I'm not a big Star Wars fan (though I did see the first 3 films), so I wasn't in a rush to see this one.  But it was much better than I thought. With over 1000 user comments, everything's probably been said already.  So here are my comments, fast and furious:Natalie Portman is luminous in this film.  Resembling a young Julia Roberts, I couldn't take my eyes off of her.  A star is born.What's up with the girl wearing braces in the scene with the kids and Ani Skywalker before the pod race?  They have orthodontia in their universe?!?!The pod race was definitely the highlight for me.Jar Jar Binks was annoying but I did like his battle scene antics.  Very amusing.  Hated his speech-- I couldn't understand half of what he said. This is probably intentional so as to get more second- and third-time viewers. ;) Since I knew he was computer generated, I found myself distracted whenever he appeared-- trying to see if I could tell the difference between him and the real people.  Mostly I couldn't.  But Liam and the kid once look sort of in the wrong direction when Jar Jar speaks.The plot of the movie was hard to follow (but then, I even have trouble with James Bond movies).  At the beginning, with the taxation without representation thing, I was like, ""What is this, the American Revolution?"" I could tell the good guys from the bad guys, but that's about all I could figure out.  Again, this is probably intentional so as to get more second- and third-time viewers. ;)Another ""mistake"" (probably also in the other Star Wars movies)-- they call their star(s) ""the sun"".  That's an ""earth"" thing.  There is no reason to assume that every solar system refers to their star as ""the sun"".  They should have another name for it (too picky?).Who tought Yoda how to speak English?  Stevie Nicks? (listen to her song ""Long Time To Go"" and you'll know what I'm talking about). ;)Overall rating: 7 out of 10.  Worth seeing.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Breathtaking computer generated F/X take the lead role, as the stage is set for the greatest sci-fi story ever","In the most anticipated film of all time, Star Wars episode 1 The Phantom Menace, grabs you right away with two Jedi in their prime, and shows just a well trained young Jedi can do. It then blasts you to a pod race that is the definition of the word intense. All this is a set up for the four count it 4 layer finale. This film gives a few answers that fans have been guessing at for 15 years and a few old faces as well. But, we have all been watching mindless F\X blockbusters for 20 years, the reason that Star Wars is so huge is because we are ready to hear a great story again. Unfortunately this movie lets great actors go to waste, and has no characters for us to get to know very well. I very much enjoyed this movie, it really kicked ass, but I'm still left with a hunger for a great legend to be added to that outstanding light saber duel.

The Force is Strong With This One!,"I have to argue with the critics on this and say that this film was absolutely amazing. I honestly couldn't have expected more from a Star Wars movie.The first thing that hits you about this movie are the special effects. The droids and especially the Gungan army look amazing, you really can't tell there fully computer generated.The characters are all well written, well acted and likeable, even Jar Jar. The only Character that annoyed me was the commentator at the podrace. I thought he was about a hundred times more annoying than Jar Jar ever was. I think Darth Maul's presence on screen was kept to a good time, You don't really him to over shadow the presence of Darth Vader on the first trilogy. I felt Annakin was a little to young for the part, but you get used to it.The music, as always, was great.

If you like Sesame Street and big special effects it's your bag.,"Yes, I succumbed to the hype and put another $10.00 into George Lucas's pocket.  When will we learn, the bigger the hype and special effects, the smaller the script and plot.It's clear, George Lucas is all about money and nothing about Star Wars.  He made it for children so they would see it ten times over and buy millions of dollars in toys.

"Who cares, its STAR WARS!","Despite all the negative reviews, I still loved this movie and have gone back to see it 2 more times already, and its only Thursday!  The one thing I always liked about Star Wars is its ability to capture my imagination and take it on a ride.  This movie delivers on that thrill.  I can't help but to continue picturing myself wandering around in dazed wonder at the places depicted in this film and all other things Star Wars.Naboo is the most beautiful place I have ever seen depicted on film.  I just wish Lucas would leave more room for human character development and plot - that is where the real story lies.  The story line is good, but can be drowned out by too much computer generated characterization.  Jar Jar Binks is a little too much, and the junket dealer and slave owner is too contorted.  And what the hell is 'Willow' doing in there?  The coincidence of C3PO being made by Anakin, come on!  Lets have a little plot diversity - not everything can be that connected, force or not - leave a little more to chance.On the other hand, all of the characters were well acted.  Natalie Portman did not give a stiff performance.  Jake Lloyd did a fine job. Liam Neeson and Ewan MacGregor were perfect as Jedi's.Overall, the story unfolds perfectly, setting the tone for episodes II and III. I loved the movie and plan on seeing it a few more times on the big screen.  Wow!",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"As a Kid's film, outstanding, as an adult film, not bad","It's probably worth mentioning that I stayed as far away from hype and knowing the plotline as possible. I think that may have been what saved this movie for me. There are very few movies released at this time of year that live up to the hype. Star Wars Episode I is no exception to that rule but it does have a lot of redeeming features. Anyone with half a brain knew this film would have a weaker storyline than Episodes IV, V and VI otherwise this one would have been made in 1977, not Episode IV. The reason is that the main characters are Jedi, not the most interesting people in the universe, until they start fighting that is. So with no Han Solo character, this really is just a scene setter and should not really be looked at as anything else. Having said that the Special Effects are simply mind blowing. I don't think most people realise just how much of this movie is actually composited and it's certainly the best example of how it can be done well. It's a shoo-in for the Effects Oscar, only the Matrix provides any competition to it and in any other year the Matrix would have won it. But while Jar Jar is annoying at first, I stopped noticing it after a while. The performances are pretty good even though the roles were not too demanding. I am surprised that more was not made of Hugh Quarshie's role as Captain Panaka or Steven Speirs as Captain Tarpals these two seemed the only ones with good potential as characters. I'll admit to some confusion over the dual role of Amidala and Padme, which was which when? A far from perfect film that is let down in the first half but redeemed in the second half. From the Pod Race onwards it's excellent for all ages. Before that it's a little dull, the timing is off. Perhaps George Lucas could have left the Directorial duties to someone who has directed more recently?",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
It could have been a great movie.,"I work in the TV news business so I was Star Wars-out the day it opened. I love sci-fi movies but even I waited almost 3 weeks to see and stood in line for about 15 seconds. If I had waited any longer than 30 minutes I would've been angry. Star Wars-Episode One:The Phantom Menace played really well when it played to adults. The opening intrigue as Qui-gon and Obi-wan are betrayed is captivating. Their adventures are worthy of the last 3 Star Wars movies, but unfortunately Jar Jar stinks and the kid who plays Annakin cannot act--when he was on with Jay Leno he was great. (Didn't Steven Spielberg and Ron Howard who have elicited great performances by kids and supposedly saw this movie back in April say anything to George?) However inspite of two major flaws ""1"" soars. Liam Neeson, Ewan MacGregor and Natalie Portman are much better than the so-called ""critics"" lead me to believe. The f/x are truly breathtaking (I'm sorry but really special f/x still blow me away after 20 years of serious filmgoing)--especially the backdrops of Naboo and Corascant (sic). The light sabre battle between (an underused) Darth Maul and the 2 Jedis is spectacular. The Senate scenes are a bit talky but plot is interesting and the action scenes are awesome. Lose Jar Jar and the kid and you have a great movie.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"There are wonderful scenes in space, underwater, and racing pods, a lightsaber fight, but a digital Yoda and Jar Jar Binks are controversial decisons","16 years. This was the time it took George Lucas to keep his famous work, which had produced three films in a range of three years from 1977. Since at that time the technology did not allow the first chapters were produced, Lucas decided to launch the fourth part of his work, A New Hope. Only in 1993, after Lucas see what his friend Steven Spielberg succeeded in Jurassic Park, is that the director realized that the technology was enough that he could begin producing the last three chapters of his masterpiece. The fans showed that they were nostalgic of the saga, and with the re-release of the film in 3D in 2012, the episode I surpassed $1 billion worldwide, today being the tenth highest grossing film history.Written and directed by George Lucas also - there was directed episodes V and VI to devote to more creative control of the work - the film presents news and is the first to realize major defects. One of the innovations of Episode I was him being photographed almost entirely with digital cameras, shortening the costs of post-production. It was also the first film to create a character of fundamental importance in the history, in a fully computerized, the Gungan Jar Jar Binks, who was the greatest technological revolution of Episode I, which secured a nomination for special effects at the Oscars that year. Eventually lost to Matrix which also revolutionized the effect that year.Long ago, in a galaxy far, far away ... The disorder was installed in the Galactic Republic. Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) is a young apprentice Jedi knight under the tutelage of Qui-Gon Jinn (Liam Neeson) ; Anakin Skywalker (Jake Lloyd), who will later father Luke Skywalker and become known as Darth Vader, is just a 9-year-old boy. When the Trade Federation cuts off all routes to the planet Naboo, Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan are assigned to settle the matter.After the Federation invades Naboo and the Jedi are forced to land on the planet. There, rescue Queen Amidala (Natalie Portman) and will bound to Coruscant, capital of the Galactic Republic. Then the driver of the ship into hyperspace failure, and are forced to seek a new on Tatooine, where Qui-Gon finds a slave boy with gifts of ""Force"", very skilled with machines and piloting of ships, called Anakin Skywalker (Jake Lloyd). Qui-Gon Jinn believed it to be the ""Chosen One"" predicted by a prophecy to bring balance to the Force, especially after he discovers that Anakin was conceived without a father, only by the power of midi-clorians. Although Gui-Gon trying to influence Watto, owner of the boy and his mother are his slaves, with the use of force, it does not allow Anakin leave and refuses to sell parts to the ship. The Jedi Anakin goes to his house, where he meets his mother, Shmi. Aware of the importance of training Anakin, they agree that the best way to escape is to use the money to enroll Amidala Anakin in a race craft. If he wins, the money can be used to repair the ship Gui-Gon. Anakin bet with Watto that will win the race. Gui-Gon takes Anakin to Coruscant then, so that he will be trained, but the Jedi Council rejects. Meanwhile, the Sith Lord Darth Sidious (Ian McDiarmid) secretly planned the attack to give his alter-ego, Senator Palpatine, a pretext to overthrow the Supreme Chancellor of the Galactic Republic and take his place.Even many years after the release of The Phantom Menace, we realize that this is the worst movie of the series. This position was previously occupied by Return of the Jedi. The expectation for the first episode was huge, as everyone present Anakin Skywalker as a child, showing feelings too noble for those who would become one of the greatest villains of cinema. Even knowing your destination, follow Anakin's childhood is a treat to all wanting to know what can still happen until episode III, prior to past successes. Moreover, as we noted the unusual intelligence and courage of the boy. Although we track the origin of the villain and stay wondering how this child would become a leading figure in the midst of war. The young Jake Lloyd who plays Anakin had the thankless task of representing the future villain. He would have to deliver a good performance as fans of the series would have a tendency to hate the guy even before he even think of becoming a Jedi, a Sith much less. The problem is that the kid is not going well and proved to be a bad actor. He seems to read the lines and not interpret them.The screenplay by George Lucas, even with multiple characters and new situations, you lose the quality of the narrative, without the objectivity of yore. The film begins with a plot that involves bureaucratic blockage of trade routes to the planet Naboo imposed by the Trade Federation. Lucas loses much time on the issue and ends up complicating what we earlier screenplays was extremely straightforward. There is no denying the importance of explaining a little more political plot to know the exact reason of the whole war in the Galaxy, but it ended up leaving the plot dragged. Another aspect that bothered fans was the appearance of a virtually all-digital Yoda. But admit that the end result is very happy and seeing their fight scenes in Attack of the Clones and Revenge of the Sith, we see that there is no way to do that if it were not so digital. Many spoke up, but the end result does not compromise in any way. Fortunately technology has only helped in the features and handling this case.When we see in A New Hope these two friendly robots escaping and landing on Tatooine and being purchased by Luke and his Uncle Owen many years later, a curiosity that was always on our minds was whether their origin was told in the new trilogy. Luckily we can see C-3PO and R2-D2 having its origins revealed. We see R2-D2 has built and actively helping in the battle showing its importance for the Rebels. Already we see that C-3PO was built by the young Anakin on Tatooine, showing the ability of the boy and the audience cheering, mainly to see the robot still unfinished.Jar Jar Binks is a separate chapter that caused the revolt of many fans. The computerized character, which has voice actor Ahmed Best, is one of the most hated characters of fiction. Initially scheduled to present a new race of intergalactic beings who have critical involvement in the Battle of Naboo, and also to be the comic relief of the film, since no R2-D2 and C-3PO talks was still unfinished and was left on Tatooine, the character tries several times to make the audience laugh through jokes inserted incorrectly. The way you talk and walk untypical muddled character were also heavily criticized by critics. George Lucas, realizing the rejection decreases to almost nothing character's participation in the subsequent films, especially in ""Revenge of the Sith.The cast includes Ewan McGregor plays a young Obi-Wan Kenobi, played by Alec Guiness and earlier does well, as well as the still young but already talented Natalie Portman as Queen Amidala / Padmé, who had previously only done the filmLéon (1994 ) as the most prominent. Liam Neeson, once again shows off his trademark ability and creates the Jedi more interesting of the entire saga, with its code of ethics and unwavering kindness. Ian McDiarmid as Senator Palpatine is also key to the plot. Unfortunately both the actors as their characters do not have the same charisma and charm that Luke, Han Solo and Princess Leia had.After so many years, the greatest curiosity was how technology could help in the construction of that universe extremely interesting built in the three previous films, without letting that seen before, that goes almost two decades of the events of this movie, stay obsolete. Everything would have to be the most charming and new technology, without diminishing the quality of the previous films and give the impression that an environment that is going on 19 years before the original trilogy, could be greater than the universe that appear later in the chronological order of the story. That all technical aspects are really impressive. If in 1977 we've been introduced to a previously unimaginable world, over 20 years after the ILM could only be overcome even more.The art direction team formed by Phil Harvey, Fred Hole, John King, Rod McLean and Peter Russell is splendid. We keep being presented with the traditional battles in space, and we can still see entire cities built like the Gungan, even more interesting by visual underwater. Also impossible not to feel nostalgia and that familiar feeling when seeing the crew of the ship descend on Tatoonie. The same landscape and semi-arid climate of the place are present again in a very beautiful work of photography David Tattersall. The special effects, overused and being privileged over the script, take the technology of the time to a level previously unknown. There are wonderful scenes in space, underwater, and racing pods, a lightsaber fight at the end of the projection, and the great Battle of Naboo. It really is hard to imagine many of these scenes being held in 1977, and Lucas made sure to make it clear that his decision to start the episode IV was the right one. And all these effects and scenes were once again packed the trail master John Williams. Anyway, the movie entertains a lot. Even with the faults mentioned, we feel that the franchise could be even more impressive than before and that technological advances alone would add to the series. The expectation for the episodes II and III only increased.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
A good start.,"I thought the movie was quite good. I felt the story was there, but it needed to focus more on Anakin than the trade dispute itself. I mean, I didn't wait 16 years to worry about the inhabitants of Naboo. I felt that the Tattoine section of the film and the political maneuvering on Coruscant were the best parts. Watto and Sebullah were excellent characters, very fun to watch. I was disappointed that Darth Maul was not given more dialogue and developed more thoroughly. He was almost a non-event, which is a pity, considering he has all the potential of being a great movie villain.Ewan Mcgregor and Liam Neeson played their characters excellently. They showed Jedi Knights as they were, amazingly intelligent and confident warriors with incredible abilities.Jake Lloyd played his role brilliantly, a very intelligent actor for such a young age. He totally surprised me.The Gungans were a waste of time. I think that they looked goofy and I couldn't take their army seriously. The same can be said of the Palace Guards. I thought their costumes were odd looking and I could never place any confidence in their abilities whatsoever.

Darth Maul is no Vader,"I really missed the presence of a Vader like villain.  Darth Maul doesn't hold a candle to Vader and as a result the film is unbalanced toward the silly side.

see it anyway.,"I am writing this review at 3 AM, just having returned from the 12:01 showing on May 19.  That's right, I got tickets.  I didn't camp out, but I got tickets.Was it magnificent? not reallyWas it the best Star Wars yet? definitely notWas it a meaningful movies packed with symbolism? of course notWas the acting good? some of the worst I've seenDid I enjoy it? every minuteIt wasn't Shakespeare, but this movie served its purpose.  It entertained me.  The plot was intriguing even though I could predict the result of every single occurrence in the movie.  I won't spoil it for anyone with details, but it doesn't take a genius to spot Lucas' weak attempts at plot twists even before they occur.  The character development is miserable, and the insertion of the comic relief character Jar-Jar Binks was as irritating as the ewoks in Return of the Jedi.  Yet, I couldn't stop watching and I couldn't help but enjoy this movie.  For once, I will plead with critics to not read into this movie.  I am willing to give Lucas some slack when it comes to quality in his writing.  Critics should let this bad movie slide by because it's Star Wars, and unless you make it a point to pick it apart (something I like to do- see my review of Return of the Jedi), you will enjoy this movie.Will I sit on the edge of my seat until Episode II?

The Greatest Movie of All Time,"This is everything I could want from a movie. It has excellent drama, visuals, character development, dialogue, story, humor, suspense... The list could go on and on forever. The profundity of the movie is  incredibly powerful. The epic story sweeps you along to the greatness and deepness of human imagination. Its philosophical wisdom is unherd-of in modern history. The atmosphere of this movie is at the same time intensely serious and truly funny. The young love story between Anakin and Padme is believably beautiful. Jar-Jar works as an absurd comic relief, carrying the tale to new skies of realism.Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace is in my opinion the best movie ever made.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Unlike the Original Trilogy,"I had a different attitude toward this film than did most people, because I have never seen this film as being a true Star Wars film. to me this film is more of what you would call a spin off movie,Like those 2 made for TV Ewok films(only these are about the early adventures of OB1 Kenobi instead of Ewoks)The prequel trilogy is not(and will never be) true Star Wars. However, I have seen this film called the worst film ever made- I thinks that is over stating it just a bit! This is not the worst film ever made, but Star Wars it isn't. I believe that Geoprge Lucas would have been better off to have made the prequel trilogy as its own entity, and having no ties to star wars.this film at best gets 3 out of 5 stars from me. If you've never seen it,the special effects alone are worth watching it at least twice, and the Light-saber fight scene is the best one they ever filmed. I wish Darth Maul would've played a larger role in the film. I felt that the whole virgin birth of Darth Vader and the references to ancient Jedi legend about the ONE who will bring balance to the force-I felt that was all unnecessary. and the I believe that the pod racing scene should've been done different, I dont think any mother in her right frame of mind is going to be that willing to let her son drive something that fast,furious and deadly- the story would've shown more of Anakin's will power to disobey and do his own thing if the writer would have had him to sneak off and race the pod.I also felt that the concept of Anakin Skywalker is the one who built C3-PO  was also unnecessary(then why didn't he remeber C3-PO in the other episodes-get my point)--it sounds like I disliked the film but in truth I liked it,but to me, I will always see this film(and its 2 sequels)as a Star Wars spin off and not true part of Star Wars itself.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Every Generation has a legend(this is not it),"Some one must have paid George Lucas A LOT of money to make this movie, and it shows.  ""The Phantom Menace"" is to Star Wars as what ""Alien Resurrection"" was to the Alien series.  They both ruined great series by big dumb plots and stupid characters. First of all, the movie hardly resembles Star Wars.  It seems to have better technology in the movie than the first 3, and there is a huge overabundance of special-effects.  In the first one there were alien characters, but this, like every other character is an alien, or looks like one.  It is sick.  The movie is so dependent on special effects Lucas paid no attention to the script. The script sucks.  I didn't give a damn when any weird-named character died because the characters were so underdeveloped.  I did not care about Qui-Gonn, Jar Jar, Obi-Wan, Queen Amidalia, Anakin(boy, did Jake Lloyd suck). The movie was marketed to death.  George Lucas sold out, and I bet you he does it in Episode II.

Phantom Lives Up to Expectations,"When a friend of mine got tickets to the most recent Star Wars adventure, I wasn't THAT excited.  I'm not a huge fan of the series, but don't get me wrong, I enjoyed the first three, it's just that I wasn't planning on waiting 5 weeks for a ticket, ya know? What awaited me in the theatre was one of the most breathtaking films I had seen in years.  The special effects may look 'too' animated during the previews, but once you're in the theatre, it looks more realistic than the originals. Some of the dialogue was stupid, and that's about the only negative criticism I can think of.  I wonder if the dialogue and the voice were meant to be so ""corny""?

Good film but does not live up to the originals,"This is a good sci-fi movie that is the beginning of the StarWars storyline. The movie delves a lot into political turmoil and conflict and tries to please a wide variety of audiences. It also tries to stand on its own which it does not do very well. The characters are well thought out though....Jar Jar is very annoying, Darth Maul is fearsome and mysterious etc. and the action scenes are top notch. But there is an overall feel that something is missing, probably due to the fact that we remember watching the originals a long time ago which are the meat and potatoes of the Star Wars story.

Where it all began?,"STAR WARS: THE PHANTOM MENACE is an interesting place to start the STAR WARS saga. Although it has taken me a while, I have grown to really like watching this film. It is, in my humble opinion, every bit as good as the original STAR WARS (A NEW HOPE).The dialog is comparable (meaning that it is god-awful); the acting is about the same (sub-par in most respects) but has some notable exceptions (such as Liam Neeson's performance, which I consider to be as good as Sir Alec Guinness' performance in STAR WARS).My one complaint in the film? Jake Lloyd.""What?"" you ask... ""Not Jar Jar Binks?"" No. I have no trouble with Jar Jar Binks what-so-ever. Although, admittedly, I had some trouble with the character after my initial viewing of the film, I have come to realize that Jar Jar is no more annoying than C3P0... in other words, this is a movie designed to be entertaining to kids at the ages of 10-14; and as an adult, I need to re-capture that 10-14 year old kid inside me in order to fully appreciate it. Jar Jar is fun when you look at him in that light.But Jake Lloyd... it is not his fault really, it is just that George decided to make Anakin too young in this film. Had Anakin been a 14-year old instead, much of the things that he does would have made a lot more sense. Watch the film -- imagine Anakin as a 14-year old and I think you will see what I mean.And back to my initial comment: once you start putting together the plot that extends from this film to Episode III, you see why this film begins when it does. But let's face it -- the sage of Star Wars actually begins much, much earlier.

Good but not the best,"I would say that ""The Phantom Menace"" is a Good film but no more. It was obvious that it would not be the best of the Star Wars films. A Character named Jar Jar ruins the movie. As unbelievable as it may seem, He is MORE annoying that C-3PO was in the Originals. If He is in Episode II, than it would be good to see him die! Another thing that ruins the movie is the unfunny jokes and the repetition of the Words ""Youpi""and ""Ani""(for Anakin) one too many times. Without that, the movie would have been as good as Star Wars: A New Hope, The Empire Strikes Back or The Return of the Jedi. It is evident that with a main character as a hero the movie becomes quite immature at times although it is well balanced out by the Lightsaber fights and it should be less evident in Episode II and III as Anakin gets older.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Worst Star Wars film by far,"Awful cgi, awful dialogue, cheesy screenplay, awkward, unfulfilling, not needed",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
For me this was an incredible experience.,"I am a fan of the Star Wars saga. I have always enjoyed the movies and I believe those who were disappointed are not being objective about this movie at all. I'll admit that I was expecting more from this movie in some aspects. The main problem that overall people really have with this movie and many don't even realise it is that one of the major plot elements, the conflict between the Naboo, and Gungans was not brought to the forefront with more of a sense of danger. I think Lucas was caught in a bind presentation wise because he wanted to bring the Jedi's conflict to the forefront and it cost this movie in the long run. There were specific scenes in the first three films that put the raw dangers of the Empire to the forefront.Examples of these scenes are when Luke returns home in 'A New Hope' to see that his only family in the universe have been killed, Han Solo being frozen in carbonite just after he and Leia realised their love for each other in 'Empire Strikes Back, and when Luke is tested and tempted by the Emperor, the Emperor apparently two steps ahead of Luke in 'Return of the Jedi.'All the while in the movie there were references to an invasion and people dying of catastrophic numbers but this was not for me at least brought to the front page. Qui Gon tells the queen at one point that he can't fight a war for her but with the way the cowardly Neimodians and weak droids are pushed around I don't see why not.The Gungan droid battle should not have been relegated to a mere distraction and even if it were the Gungans had no casualties. Even though I know Lucas wanted to preserve the PG rating I still think he should have brought the grittiness of the conflict equally through the major characters eyes. Just a pinch more of Dramtic punch would have done th trick. He had done that so well in all of the other Episodes and ultimately the dangers of the conflict were not evenly distributed. However this movie still is a remarkable achievment. The imagination and talents of many people  still flow through this movie. The realisation of the underwater Gungan city, the podrace sequence, and the Duel of the Fates is visuallly amazing. I don't think the performances are wooden. I like Natalie Portman's portrayal of the young Queen. Jake Lyod's Anakin is very raw and he has an unpolished quality that naturally comes through for me. 'How does this wideeyed boy become so disenchanted with his life that he believes his only recourse is the Dark Side?'These elements are done very well and are typical Star Wars fare. To me this movie is a great opening act introducing the world to the players and eludes to future events. For me this movie sure teases the appetite for more and I know that I will see Attack of the Clones because of the questions left unanswered by The Phantom Menace. As a stand alone film this movie was an incredible movie experience.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

"The beginning of a legacy, but the lameness remains","""The Phantom Menace"" (a truly awful title) is supposedly the beginning of the Star Wars universe.

Talk about an advertising overload. The production design in this is terrible.  Rather than the supposed functionability of the original series, everything looks like a computer-generated forgery and even the costumes are outlandishly stupid. My moral, give Lucas a 10 million dollar budget again and see what he can come up with instead of an epillepsy-inducing lightshow.Even the plot suffers from patheticism.  I've encountered fourth graders that have written better short stories.  With the death of Leigh Brackett and the uninvolvement of Lawrence Kasdan, Lucas has no one with the writing load--and it shows.

Star Wars and the Phantom Storyline,"""Star Wars"" gave us powerful icons; ""The Empire Strikes Back"" turned them into meaningful characters; ""Return of the Jedi"" turned them into action figures.  ""The Phantom Menace"" flattens them even further, giving us a 2-D world where even the human actors are treated like CGI effects.  Those who glibly state that ""Menace"" is wonderful because the visuals are impressive and story doesn't matter seem to have forgotten why we all anxiously awaited this movie for so long, namely, to see how the STORY began.  Lucas was aware enough of this to include it in the film's marketing - ""Every saga has a beginning"", etc. - but neglected to include it in the film itself.  Who is Qui-Gon?  Where's he from?  We leave the theatre knowing nothing of consequence about him, or Obi-Wan, or any other character (with the possible exceptions of Shmi Skywalker and R2-D2).  Plot points from the other movies are simply referred to, without being elaborated or enriched in any way. We watch impressive things happen without any real understanding of the people that are doing them.  You rooted for Luke and Han because of who they were, not because they were buried in a sea of CGI images.  Lucas forgot that what has sustained ""Star Wars"" for so long is the strength of the story, and has expanded his ""epic"" about as well as ""Tomorrow Never Dies"" continues the story of ""Dr. No"".",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Definitely not a disappointment,"Any Star Wars fan will LOVE this movie.  And, even though I will probably get flamed to a crisp for writing any kind of criticism about this movie, I will go ahead and speak my peace.Being the prequel for the original series makes some elements of the movie slightly predictable, such as the outcome of the light-sabre fight between Obi-Wan Kenobi and Darth Maul.I am sure anyone who has seen this movie will agree with me that Darth Maul, played by Ray Park, despite the fancy weaponry, has about as much personality as a loaf of wheat bread.Ewan McGregor and Liam Neeson, playing as a younger Obi-Wan Kenobi and Jedi master Qui-Gon Jinn, respectively, seemed to know and respect their parts EXTREMELY well.Jake Lloyd, the young Anakin Skywalker, plays his part well for an actor his age.  His mother, played by Pernilla August, offers the only real emotional acting the movie.Having never read the books, I do not know if Queen Amidala, played by Natalie Portman, should have seemed as utterly emotionless as she did. For what it was, the part was played very well.Being a computer generated character leaves little room flawed acting, and I must admit ILM did an excellent job on the 3-d characters such as Jar Jar Binks and the menacing Sebulba.  The fluid motion of them and the other literally thousands of 3-d characters makes for a spectacle of its own, but the general personalities of the characters can still carry the scene even after these 3-d effects become passé (give it ten or fifteen years).Some minor points of humor make the movie stand out.  The thrill seeking droid that gets sucked through a jet engine, Jar Jar knocking down deactivated robots after the control ship gets destroyed, a set of droid legs running around after being cut off from the body.Altogether, George Lucas put The Phantom Menace together extremely well, and I believe that, even if the last four chapters were not already written, we could ALL definitely look forward to the sequels.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
It begins...,"The Phantom Menace is one of those movies that I have been meaning to review since I first saw it on opening day years and years ago. I have a little book where I make notes of movies I would like to review, and when I flipped back to the page for Episode I, I noticed that the last time I jotted down a couple of points about this movie was December 26, 2002. Odd coincidence that I should be four years later to the day that I finally sit down to review it.The first thing that really struck me after seeing it for the first time was a huge sense of surprise at how much it did not live up to my expectations. I'm hardly a Star Wars fanatic, I don't even know many character names beyond the primary three or four, but I know the three original films and I understand how brilliant they are. I think that what went wrong was a combination of almost unprecedented expectation, too much CGI capability, and too much money.Lucas, who loathed studios in his earlier days as a filmmaker, now laments the fact that he has nearly become a studio himself. He funded Episode I out of his own pocket, and I think that now that he has the ability to really do anything he wants (since he has unlimited funding and it's all his own anyway, so he makes all of the rules with virtually no limitations), we get for the first time a really look at his strengths and weaknesses.I'm not going to go into the weaknesses too much because there are far more strengths than weaknesses, and I suppose I should point out at this point that The Phantom Menace is a very strong Star Wars movie, it's just not what it could have and should have been. It will take audiences time to accept additions like a digital Yoda, Samuel L. Jackson, and Jar Jar Binks to such a well known saga as the Star Wars films, and I think that things like that can account for some of the bad reactions that the movie received.On the other hand, the film really emphasizes how powerful Lucas' visual imagination is, which could also be seen in the first three films. His ability to dream up imaginary worlds and creatures and societies is as astonishing as it ever has been, and the general, overall badassedness (and the names!) of characters like Qui Gon Jin and Darth Maul is astonishing. The battle between Obi Wan, Qui Gon Jin, and Darth Maul I think is one of the best fight scenes in the entire series up to this point. Consider the way that Qui Gon, when they are fighting through that hallway where they're separated periodically by force fields, kneels and meditates when they're separated, while Darth Maul paces back and forth like a caged tiger. And of course the pod-racing scene was phenomenal!And the look of the film is beautiful from beginning to end. Indeed, during the slow parts, if you find yourself drifting away from the complexities of the plot being unfolded through diplomatic dialogue a little too thick to handle, you can entertain yourself just by gazing at the stunning surroundings. Jake Lloyd handles his role well for someone so young, as does the initially questionably cast Natalie Portman, who seems far too cute for the role but pulls it off brilliantly. Liam Neeson steals every scene he is in (and seems to belong in the film more than anyone else), but the casting seems to be all pretty much right on the mark. It's really unfortunate about Jar Jar though, he's just not a clever character.This is the first film that George Lucas has directed in more than 20 years (since the original Star Wars film), and it's clear that he is getting the feel of it all back in this movie. As brilliant as he is, directing is not his strong point, but as we saw from Episodes II and III, in The Phantom Menace he was just getting warmed up.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Cool, sad, cool, sort of dumb","I loved the movie. It really got me going. I saw the first one when I was about 6. Qui Gon and Obi Wan were very cool as characters. Amidala was good, very noble air.

The saber duel was great with Maul pacing and Qui resting. It was a classic scene that helped make the movie. Jar-Jar was sort of lame.

Jar Jar Binks is an insult to human intellect as we know it; he doesn't even look like a real creature. In fact, none of the digital characters here do. The backgrounds look real enough, but the digital characters just don't look real. George Lucas has become so blown over by how much easier computers make it that he forgot you still have to make it look real.

"Not as good as the originals, but still good","People are very harsh on Episode 1 because they compare it to the other Star Wars movies, which are the greatest movies of all time. This is a tough, almost impossible, act to follow. I thought Episode 1 was an excellent movie. Sure, it didn't live up to the original Star Wars movies, but how could it?Many people complain about a weak plot. What they don't understand (well, some do) is that this ""weak plot"" is an introduction to the entire Star Wars story. They needed this ""weak plot"" in order to begin the chain of events that will eventually lead to the Star Wars trilogy that we all know and love. It can be argued that Episode 1 took a bullet in the from of a ""weak plot"" (that wasn't TOO weak) for the good of the Star Wars story, which is much bigger than just one movie.The acting in Episode 1 for the most part, I thought, was good. I think Natalie Portman did an excellent job as Queen Amidala and Padme. In one scene, she could sound very royal and noble, and in another scene she could seem very child-like, emotional and adorable. Ian McDiarmid did a great job as Senator Palpatine, the future Emperor. And, of course, Liam Neeson and Ewan McGregor were excellent. Both of them gave Oscar-worthy performances. Ray Park did a good job as the sinister villian Darth Maul. Even though it wasn't his voice, he did an unbelievable job with the lightsaber battle.The setting and scenery were great. Naboo was a beautiful planet, but Coruscant was the greatest of all. The conference room that had thousands of hovercrafts, one for each race, was also very impressive.The lightsaber battle at the end of this movie is the greatest moment in movie history, I am convinced. If it does not win Oscars this year, I will have to assume the Oscar board was paid off by another movie. It makes this entire movie worth seeing. I get the chills every time I watch it.OK, so Jar Jar Binks is annoying. It's not as bad as everyone says. I hope (even though I know it is not gonna happen) that George Lucas keeps him out of Episode 2 and 3. Jake Lloyd also didn't do such a great acting job, but it was fair, especially for someone of his age. The cameo-like performance by Samuel L. Jackson was great. I was hoping for him to say something like, ""Hand me my lightsaber, mother****er"" though. :)I think George Lucas did a great job with Episode 1.

The Movie That Might Have Been,"This was one of the most anticipated movies of the century. Unfortunately, George Lucas blew it.  It was primarily a vehicle for his special effects and, indeed, they were spectacular.  I just wish he had put the same effort into the story and characters.  The story itself is very predictable with virtually no plot twists to keep us guessing.  I found myself able to predict the next event all throughout the movie.  The story line also seemed very contrived and uninspiring(an interstellar trade conflict).The characters were very two-dimensional; I felt that I never really new who they were.  They seemed to be in the story just to move it along and be introduced for the next sequel.  After viewing this movie I realized that a critical element was missing, namely an anti-hero to add suspense.  Every major character did exactly what he or she was supposed to do.You might think that I am just a cranky curmudgeon who hates Star Wars. Wrong!  I loved the original three.  In fact I saw this latest installment twice just to find out if I was missing something upon seeing it the first time.  But, alas, it was just as bad upon viewing it a second time. I am at a loss to explain how so many people could give it such high marks.  My only explanation is that they are fanatics who live and breathe Star Wars and have no other life to speak of.

Star Wars fans avoid the new series!,"The new series of movies are as if the they are not made by the same person. Actually, in a way, they aren't.

The movie (whole quasi-star wars prequel trilogy) lacks the mysticism of the original series. Thats the main problem. In the original trilogy you had knights, wizards, spiritual power and a princess. In the new series you only have a princess and wannabe knights and wizards with some kind of organism living in them which gives them the force (what????). Where is that Lucas from the 70's gone? The one that wrote about people with unexplainable powers, a force flowing through them that is in all living things.

Strictly for the kiddies,"It's ironic that one of the most anticipated films of the twentieth century will be remembered as being one of the biggest let-downs ever in the history of cinema.

It was no surprise SW were left bitterly disappointed by the dirge 'The Phantom Menace' revealed itself to be, a mix of dull dialogue and scenes clearly intended to sell toys to children in the audience.'The Phantom Menace' charts the early years of Anakin Skywalker, the boy who would grow to be Darth Vader and purge the galaxy of the Jedi. We see how nine-year-old Anakin entered the life of a young Obi-Wan Kenobi and how he eventually came to be Kenobi's Apprentice as well as his first meeting with Padme, the future mother of Luke and Leia.Character-wise, Obi-Wan and his Master Qui-Gon are the only ones of really of worth. Ewan MacGregor, as Obi-Wan, and Liam Neeson, as Qui-Gon, depict a Master and Apprentice pairing that is complex mix of familial love and Qui-Gon continually snubbing the young man who adored him as a surrogate father in favour of this new child in his life. Other than that, we have a bland, boring female lead in Natalie Portman's Padme and then there is Anakin himself and the detestable Jar-Jar Binks.Anakin, aged nine, would have been a far more effective character had we seen him for being the slave he was instead of this happy-go-lucky all-American moppet. As a teenager, being a slave still deeply affected him but there is no sense of that in this film. Anakin should have been shown to be jaded and pained by what he was and been played by someone who is more solemn, such as Haley Joel Osment (who did audition for the role). Jake Lloyd just wasn't suited because he was too used to playing family/comedy roles and was too buoyant to properly show the depressing situation Obi-Wan and Qui-Gon found Anakin in. Sadly, people are too quick to blame little Lloyd for the problems with this film when it was George Lucas fully to blame for choosing the cute child over the talented one, and for writing such terrible dialogue for this character.As for Jar-Jar, the less said about him the better. This was a CGI-character who talked incomprehensible drivel and clearly added to amuse kiddiewinkles with his 'hilarious' slap-stick antics. I don't know about children but anyone over ten are just left cringing whenever he is on-screen. This character is an embarrassment to cinema and would be far more at home in Lucas' infantile 'Ewoks' cartoon.What could have been an excellent prequel exploring what moulded Darth Vader into the complex man he became was ruined by a plot that dithered between being positively childish and overly-political. There are scenes that drag on, bogged down with Padme and the Jedi dealing with the governmental side-plot, and then there are scenes where we have Anakin showing far more competence and ability than the Jedi, obviously trying to create in him a character who appeals to eight-year-old boys in the audience. The ten minute long Pod-race was just an advert to sell a computer game and just didn't need to be so long.Overall, this film is passable but really far from enjoyable. It would suit tiny would-be fans of the series who will eventually grow up to watch the original trilogy but any of secondary school age will be left disappointed and bored. Personally, I feel I'm better off just sticking with the originals and forgetting the prequels ever existed.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Entertaining if nothing else!,"This first installment of the Star Wars saga has been so wonderfully done. George Lucas comes through again with a wildly entertaining movie that contains a perfect balance of drama, comedy and action.The Trilogy was never highly regarded for superb acting (except for Alex Guinness) and so nothing changes in Episode I - there are no dazzling performances, but there are GOOD performances. All the actors are seasoned professionals who do the job well in guiding us through the story.Though the story has a political plot, it still manages to appeal to younger kids. This might be due to the presence of in the now infamous Jar Jar Binks. Occasionally annoying, Jar Jar and his civic leader, Boss Nass provide some necessary comic relief.If you are not amazed by the acting, or by the plot, you have to be amazed by the amazing special effects. CGI characters such as Jar Jar, Boss Nass and the flying Watto are the most amazing computer graphic images ever placed on the big screen. In fact, much of the movie is done by computer animation. Quite often there are scenes in which nothing is really there - it's all computer originated. Amazing!As a Star Wars fan, I find the movie intriguing till the very end, but those who are not particularly interested in the saga should at least find it classic entertainment.The Phantom Menace is not the best Star Wars ever, but it is still extremely well done. It will win a couple of Academy Awards (possibly Film Editing, Sound, Sound Effects, Visual Effects and Dramatic Score) and most of all, it deserves a spot in history as part of the epic saga that took place long ago in a galaxy far, far away.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"been there, done that: What's wrong George? No more originality?","Perhaps no movie could compare to the combined marketing blitz and anticipation that this movie followed.  The media blitz, the fan pages, and the oh-so-convenient mass merchandising left even me, a Star Wars fan (not an out-for-blood, stand-in-line-for-two-weeks fan, mind you) very skeptical to begin with.In short, the film contained too many parallels to the first film; so many plants to former references that it felt like it had to make excuses to die-hard followers; inadequate special effects (only because we've seen Lucasfilm's technology in non-Lucas productions) to the point where I was unimpressed; unlike how original Star Wars movies just boggled the mind.Certainly the plot was less than intriguing.  But maybe that's the way things go.  I gave George Lucas more credit to come up with a fanciful and interesting tale.  Instead this film was filled with kiddie humor, toilet humor, and vague & unsatisfying development. What a waste of talent all around.  There were great actors, a great director, great if not unsurpassed special effects potential, and a crazy-sized budget.  What happened?? ...And yet, on the other hand:  I still recommend seeing it.

Weakest Entry But More of Original Story Inspiration revealed,"Long ago, in a Galaxy far away came a film which saved FOX studios from bankruptcy. It was conceived by a 16 year old George Lucas after he saw the 1959 film Ben Hur. This gave him the ideas which are now lynch pins of the entire series - an all powerful force, an evil empire, emperor, a purpose for our universe.This film reveal more of what inspired Lucas in the pod race sequence. It is so eerily similar to the chariot race in Ben Hur that it is not hard to imagine where the idea came from. It is interesting how one of the great films was turned into a 6 movie series of science fiction. When a man stands upon the greatness of others fiction (General Lew Wallace), Lucas has created a work which is to the 20th Century what Ben Hur was to the 19th century. History repeats itself.The major problem with this movie is though the actor is charmingly played, Anakin is just too young to be believable in this kids body. If the young actor had been in the 14 to 16 year old range, such as Lucas was when he saw Ben Hur, this movie would have been better. None the less, this film provides a lot of great special effects work & also shows another hint of the Ben Hur original - explaining Anakins Birth as a divine event. This in effect molds him as the Christ child of this series. At the same time, they also make Anakin a slave, mixing his character with that of Judah Ben Hur who was a slave too.This is a true first film of the series as this reveals that in 1959, 16 year old Lucas saw Ben Hur at the movies and used it as a basis for the entire Star Wars Series.This film is an essential piece of the story leading to the next 2 pieces. While the divine birth is only mentioned here, there is no doubt about George Lucas divine inspiration for the entire series after seeing this film.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"The Phantom Mess -- Lacks either a Phantom or a Menace, Instead just a Mess -- Overall Bad Film-making","Let me preface this review by saying I am a huge fan of the original three movies, particularly the first two. If George Lucas' name and the title ""Star Wars"" were absent from the poster and ads during the pre-release hype of this film, this overlong wasted 2-hours-of-your-life masquerading as a movie would have miserably bombed at the box office. The best way to sum it up is this: it is as if the filmmaker didn't know anything about Star Wars, except the filmmaker was the writer and director of the original Star Wars films. The result is what you might expect if the Star Wars franchise was turned over to a different production company, as was done in Superman III. However, Lucas did not trade his gold mine for a billion dollars, but instead he may have killed the golden goose. This is probably one of a half-dozen of the biggest disappointments in film history, given the hype, the expectations, and the name surrounding this movie. Sure, it would probably not live up to the originals, even if it was good, but it doesn't work even modestly well as a story. The script needed only about 14 rewrites.The story is supposed to chronicle the early life of Anakin Skywalker who eventually becomes Darth Vader, the baddie from the original movies. A potentially noble endeavor, I guess, in that it would tell in more detail the story of the Clone Wars before the rise of the Empire. The Empire is chronicled in the original 1977 movie beginning with the renamed fourth episode, ""A New Hope"". Even aside from the story of this prequel, of which about 98% makes no sense, there are serious continuity problems in how this film fits in with the original three films, aka episodes IV-VI.Several aspects of the ""story"" are a jumbled mess. When we first meet young Anakin Skywalker, he is supposedly a slave. And yet he gets tons of free time to work on, guess what?-- a droid called C3PO. First continuity problem: in a ""A New Hope"" C3PO is programmed as a ""protocol droid, versed in all the customs of different races of aliens. When he meets Luke Skywalker (son of Anakin) in Star Wars IV, C3PO knows nothing about Luke and vice-versa. He doesn't even know about R2D2's mission. Further, what would a slave be doing making a Protocol Droid, versed in all the customs? Not to mention that slaves normally have NO free-time, the whole thing makes little sense. It seemed Lucas wanted an excuse to bring C3PO back. I love C3PO, but this was not the way to bring him into the story.Liam Neeson and Ewan McGregor play Jedi Knights, and they are wearing beige-colored robes similar to those worn by Obi-Wan Kenobi on the desert planet. Well, that makes sense, doesn't it? Obi-Wan aka Ben Kenobi was a Jedi, right? Well, if you remember, Luke's uncle also wore the same type of robe: they were robes for the desert! I never once thought in the original movie that the beige sand robes were Jedi uniforms! Qui-Gon Jinn was sort of an interesting Jedi who was at odds with the order, and I would have liked to understand better why he was in conflict with the other Jedis. And Samuel Jackson as another Jedi was a terrible casting choice. I admire the work of Jackson about as much as any actor, but he seemed like his character had been spawned from Planet East Los Angeles.Then there is the race competition that might liberate young Anakin from his bondage as a slave. At the time, I thought, OK, he'll lose the race, and then we'll really have a story. Nope. He wins the race. Of course, the race only lasts about four hours, showing off all the neat CGI affects. This is no story. There's no obstacle for Anakin. His slavery really didn't seem that bad, and now he is liberated easily. I also missed what the Phantom or the Menace was, except for a red-clad dark Jedi called Darth Maul who seemed, for reasons not entirely explained, to like to beat up on Jedis. It seemed the movie needed a baddie called ""Darth"" somewhere, and he was it.Ultimately, a wasted opportunity, as Lucas probably got 200 million to make this thing. What the film really needed was a script editor. Or maybe a better storyteller. Lucas really made five and a half good films (maybe six and a half at most if you liked THX 1138), American Graffiti, Star Wars IV: A New Hope, Star Wars V: The Empire Strikes Back, Star Wars VI: Return of the Jedi (really about half a good film, all the Ewok adventures seemed completely at odds with the rest of the film), The Raiders of the Lost Ark, and Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade. Maybe this Star Wars movie wouldn't have been so bad if it had been written by someone who was truly dedicated to Star Wars. Lucas didn't seem up to the task.",2.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

"A Big Disappointment, there's no denying it,","Star Wars: Episode I: The Phantom Menace is a decent movie with a reasonably well developed storyline and a mediocre cast. It's certainly the weakest film in the franchise, which is upsetting since its technically the first, but there's still a lot of good in this film that I think the major fans never think about when they criticize this, Liam Neeson boasts a fantastic performance as Qui-Gon Jinn, his dialogue is terrific and at times quite inspirational even for reality, the soundtrack is once again fantastic, the effects are superb, Darth Maul is a terrific, memorable post-Darth Vader villain (even if his screen time is very limited) and any scene with C3PO, R2D2 or Yoda would bring a smile to any fans face. I will admit this film is a major disappointment for any fan of the franchise and there is honestly much more to complain about than to give praise to, first off the story takes forever to actually get going, over an hour in and we are still in Tatooine watching amateur pod racing, the comic relief is brutal, it's handled with pure class in the original three, but here it isn't even funny, particularly Jar Jar Binks, who is just horror to watch, also the main villain isn't introduced until about ninety minutes in, and is (spoiler ahead) killed off way too early, Darth Maul could have been terrific as the main villain of the entire prequels , serving as this trilogies Vader. I like many of the performances, but there are many, many cringe worthy ones as well, a tone of the characters with brief dialogue deliver it with no charisma, some of the voice actors are uninspired and others are quite racist, Natalie Portman literally just says her lines, and the worst part of the entire movie has to be Jake Lloyd, who is extremely irritating, dosen't say any of his dialogue the way he is suppose to and probably didn't even understand the story, but it isn't his fault really, he was only nine years old, George Lucas clearly couldn't direct him, age is no exception when you're making a movie, you should be telling your actors when they're doing a poor job, and strive to improve them. It has many great moments, but more so there are many imperfections, it's very hard to recommend Star Wars Episode I: the Phantom Menace, but if you're watching the entire series, there is no way it can be missed.Two Jedi Knights who have escaped from a hostile blockade meet a boy named Anakin Skywalker, whom one of them believes will bring balance to the force, and truly is the chosen one.Best Performance: Liam Neeson Worst Performance: Jake Lloyd",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Good film... just not up to the Star Wars reputation...,"Whilst `Phantom' is a rather reasonable Hollywood Blockbuster and a good film in its own right, as an episode in the Star Wars Saga it really does not live up to the reputation.What makes a Star Wars movie great? It is nothing less than its characters and ideas! Darth Vadar, Han Solo and Yoda are all household names and the average person is easily captivated by their presence on screen, and the concept of the force could almost be considered a real-life cult. The parallels to be drawn between a world war 2 bombing run and the trench run on the Death Star made the fantastical world seem so real. The original trilogy was the be all and end all of great Saturday night entertainment.So why does `Phantom' fail? To begin with, Darth Maul has nowhere near the presence of Darth Vadar and the young emperor seems less foreboding. The hero is an annoying ten-year-old boy and the dialogue seems rather out of place in many situations. The love angle between Amidala and Anakin is amateur in comparison to the tension between Han and Lea and it is also rather abrupt and unbelievable. The standout point would have to be Jar Jar who is no Chewbacca. It appears the creation of Jar Jar was motivated more towards a cheap laugh and appeal to small children rather than a valuable asset in the story.It just doesn't have the aura of the first films, plain and simple. The Characters are far too life-less and cheap, the situations are far more one-dimensional and forced and the dialogue takes itself way too seriously. Oh and on a side note, the massive' battle between toward the end of the film is a big let down.However to be fair `Phantom' does have a few moments when the Star Wars thrill comes out to shine. Namely the Pod Race, which like the trench run on the Death Star can be paralleled to a real world phenomenon. The Jedi battle at the end is also another highlight and one of the better sword fights to grace the silver screen.Overall however the film lets the Star Wars reputation down, without being totally wiped out. It is a certainly not a bad film, it just had too much to live up to. I did enjoy it, I just wish wish wish My suggestion is to make up your own mind, Star Wars fan or not.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Almost the best of the lot, but the first still reigns.","From a production standpoint, this is a big-screen experience that can't be matched. Perhaps a tad too much computer generated imagery in that a few scenes were handled in such fashion that didn't have to be, but that's minor quibble on my part. Given that so many new characters were introduced, I didn't mind the fact that were delved into deeper. That's for the next 2 movies anyway. I did find one major annoyance in the Jar Jar Binks character. I'll ignore the assininity surrounding his appearances (which are myriad) as best I can when I see it a second time. I'm no longer the same kid who saw Star Wars when it was released, but I'm betting even kids won't warm up his ridiculous one-dimensionality. Hope he's one show character. I enjoyed the performances of the rest of the cast wholeheartedly, even the characters who weren't supposed to be likable. Also enjoyed being able to see a little more of the political background the saga is set against. Senator Palpatine was the best of the lot, and I hope we get more and more of him.All in all, worth seeing and very much so.

The only gripe is the ""Wicket Factor"". If you remember the cute Ewok who first meets Leia and your reaction to him, then you'll appreciate my reaction to Jar Jar Binks and the other child-pleasing elements of the movie (pod racing commentator with two heads, Anakin's little buddies). I found them slightly out of touch with the true essence of Star Wars, as the Ewoks were.

"Review of ""Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace"" (1999) - 7/10","""Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace"" is a film that evokes mixed feelings. On one hand, it is an essential part of the legendary saga; on the other, it has its flaws that might diminish the enjoyment of watching it.Pros:✅ Visual effects and world-building
For its time, the film was a breakthrough in CGI technology. The planets Naboo, Coruscant, and even the podrace on Tatooine look impressive. George Lucas once again created a deep and immersive world that is a pleasure to explore.✅ Lightsaber duel
One of the film's highlights is the battle between Qui-Gon Jinn, Obi-Wan Kenobi, and Darth Maul. The choreography, John Williams' Duel of the Fates, and the dynamic combat make this scene one of the best in the entire franchise.✅ Expansion of the mythology
The film shows the Jedi at the height of their power, introduces us to the Republic and the Senate, and explores new aspects of the Force, such as midi-chlorians (though this detail remains controversial among fans).Cons:❌ Pacing and politics
While the plot is important for understanding the story, numerous political debates in the Senate can feel dull. The film's pacing suffers due to an excessive focus on intrigue, which could have been presented more concisely.❌ Jar Jar Binks
This character remains one of the most divisive in the entire series. His comedic moments feel forced, and his role in the story doesn't justify the amount of screen time he receives.❌ Acting performances
Liam Neeson delivers a fantastic performance as Qui-Gon, and Ian McDiarmid is brilliant as Palpatine, but Jake Lloyd's portrayal of young Anakin often feels unnatural. However, this is not entirely his fault, as the script doesn't give the characters much depth.Conclusion""The Phantom Menace"" is a film that has its flaws but remains an important part of the saga. Yes, it has slow moments and questionable characters, but it also offers thrilling battles, expands the Star Wars universe, and lays the foundation for future events. It's a classic worth watching, especially for fans of the series.Rating: 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Necessary But Inert Installment in the ""Star Wars"" Series","George Lucas, what hath thou done to ""Star Wars?""Alas, only die-hard ""Star Wars"" fans will be able to enjoy this first prequel, and even they may be hard pressed to muster up an ounce of interest in this inert story about trade disputes and underhanded politics that doesn't make an ounce of sense until you've seen episodes II and III. Admittedly, ""The Phantom Menace"" gets better after you've seen the rest of the series, but on its own merits it's a pretty shaky effort.Lucas proves that he has virtually no skill in directing actors, as normally good performers like Liam Neeson and Natalie Portman sink like lead weights under terrible dialogue that no one could do anything with. (And don't even get me started on Samuel L. Jackson, who looks like he would rather be doing his laundry than appearing in this film). Lucas gives his actors no help either, as ""Menace,"" and indeed the entire second trilogy, may as well be animated, and more often than not an actor is stranded in a sea of computer-generated graphics with nothing to react to. This computer-generated world looks nothing like the world created in the first trilogy, and that inconsistency is one of the most distracting things about the prequels.There are things about this movie I do like, though. I like the scenes with Anakin and his mom; I like Darth Maul; and I liked the pod race scene.

Definite Flaws But High Points Throughout,"The first film to follow the original trilogy, and one widely panned by fans and general viewers alike, The Phantom Menace has a lot of positives to it, they're just often overshadowed by the negatives.Whilst a good film overall, with a solid premise and well connected to the original trilogy through planets, species and characters, the best parts are frequently interrupted by the irritating additions into the story. It is inventive with the plot, but also answers questions of the franchise rather lazily or underwhelmingly (e.g., Midichlorians and Anakin's lack of a father).Whilst Anakin is of course vital to the plot, ultimately the film revolves around a child painfully obnoxious with dreadful dialogue. It's poor to criticise a child actor, but the delivery of such forced lines stand out in a generally sub-par script. This necessary evil of a character is joined by the entirely unnecessary evil of Jar Jar Binks. The clumsy Gungan could be entirely removed from the film with little impact, as his comic relief is poorly placed; it's slapstick nature contrasting so strongly with Qui-Gon Jinn's severity.Whilst this isn't a great combination, that doesn't lessen the great performance of Neeson, and likewise McGregor. Portman, Park and McDiarmid are all perfectly cast (McDiarmid returning for the prequels but in a different guise), and largely the characters lay solid foundations for the prequel trilogy. Whilst working with stifled dialogue, their motivations and personalities shine through.Further still, The Phantom Menace provides one of the greatest battles in the Franchise: The Duel of the Fates. Fantastic choreography, brilliant weight to it, and matched by an outstanding soundtrack. Maul is a fantastic villain, and the movements between the three involved are thrilling.Love it or hate it, even the likes of pod-racing adds something different to the universe. It does drag on for a little too long, and focuses on Lloyd gritting his teeth a little too frequently, but it's still fun. What's more, visually it holds up 25 years later. Some of the scenes throughout the film aren't quite as sharp, but some of the settings look fantastic, and would have been the pinnacle of visual landscapes at the time of release.Whilst deeply flawed at times, cringeworthy but memorable in the wrong way, Episode I provides some great moments in the Star Wars franchise, and what may not be appreciated by one generation can certainly be appreciated by another.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

The prequel trilogy's larger arc is laid out with the addition of Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn, the mysterious Sith Lord Darth Maul, and the youthful Anakin Skywalker, all of whom give the story more depth. The film's grandeur is complemented with a sweeping and poignant musical score by John Williams, which continues to be one of his best works.

"Flawed, but enjoyable","I was torn between a 6 and a 7 on this one. The visuals are stunning, but Jar Jar is annoying, but overall this was enjoyable. The CGI actually doesn't look that bad! Sure some of it looks super dorky but it was pretty fun and enjoyable to watch. Overall, 6.5/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Definitely a ""Prequel""","This film was pretty good, although not quite up to ""Star Wars"" standards. The film is certainly a ""prequel,"" and you'll need all of your fingers and toes to count the loose ends which will be tied up in later episodes.  The best part about the movie:  the light saber fights were as well choreographed as anything Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers have done.  The worst part:  the computer-generated effects (although very good) are still not quite realistic, and at times give the impression that the movie is a big cartoon.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Beginning of the End,"In 1977 audiences were hugely impressed by ""Star Wars"", three years later ""The Empire Strikes Back"" solidified that success, and three more years later, ""Return of The Jedi"" beautifully concluded the story. Many years later things were altered or added to the three old movies, some were improvements, others were damaging. Finally, in 1999 another movie was released, the beginning of a new trilogy. Only it wasn't a continuation of the well-known tale, rather, it was a precursor to it. Apparently, this cinematic story was too ambitious to have been told earlier.There is a lot of material here, and some of it may raise questions. But the big picture isn't hard to understand and has a meaningful story worth following. The movie is vivid and rich. The outer space scenes are outstanding. The combination of computer generated images and the real thing is impressive. Whoever saw this back in the old days will not be easily impressed by 2009's ""Avatar"" or the visually strongest installments in the ""Marvel Cinematic Universe"". And the underwater sequences are worthy rivals to James Cameron's ""The Abyss"".What should be criticized is, for instance, some of the alien creatures. In the old movies, most of them were ridiculous puppets only there to demonstrate how rich this world was in all sorts of life forms. Here, more emphasis is given to aliens. Some of them look unrealistic and ugly, but thankfully occupy handfuls of seconds. Others have a major part in the story. And not just one creature like the big bipedal monkey named Chewie from the old ""Star Wars"", there is an entire alien race here. Visually, they are well made. But the design is cartoonish. One such alien, in particular, audiences found annoying. But one cannot deny that these creatures are an element of the plot and they have their respectful part in the story. They are there for a reason, and the movie explores it well.Some would wrongfully criticize actors when others would rightfully criticize the director for some of his decisions. The perfect balance between all the elements of the big picture, were the elements serious or childish, wasn't accomplished. But even so, this is an interesting tale with selfless heroes and mighty villains all in a colossal world that is doomed to undergo dramatic changes, beautiful visuals and more spine chilling music from the one and only John Williams. And 2012's 3D release was a good chance to experience ""The Phantom Menace"" on a big theatrical screen should anyone have missed their chance years earlier. This version even had an improvement. One of the alien creatures was originally a puppet, like in the old movies, only this puppet looked much different than in the old movies, which did not fit in well. Now, it has been replaced with a good digital version. Created with a different technological tool, but better suiting the overall story spanning many movies.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Some critics are born losers....,"I do not see the problem with TPM, I thought it was an excellent addition to the Star Wars Series, being a Die-hard Star Wars fan myself, I loved this movie, enough to see it on several occasions, which, I must say I recommend, because the 2nd or 3rd time you pick up a lot of stuff you may have missed the first time. So therefore, TPM deserves a lot more respect and is a milestone in the movie business.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
It's all about the lightsaber battle,"I know we were all excited for this episode to come out. And I know that we were all bugged by what George Lucas did to our beloved trilogy. But this is actually a pretty fun film -- the lightsaber battle between Darth Maul, Obi-Wan and Qui-Gon is one of the best of the entire series and makes up for most of Lucas' other mistakes in this movie, in my opinion.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
I Give Up,"Am I supposed to think it a coincidence that Jar Jar sounds so much like another floppy eared cartoon in a live action film? Could he be a more blatant homage to Roger Rabbit? I actually prefer big rubber aliens that don't move to these goofy animations. Switching back and forth between live actors and cartoons of the same actors in impossible situations is even worse, for example, cartoon Qui Gon jumping into Amidala's ship to escape fight with Maul. Don't get me started on Jabba, big rubber alien much better again than cartoon. It seems when poor Greedo died the best alien effects died with him. As for immaculate conception of Ani, I did suspect a ruse. I thought for sure we would discover that a Sith had raped her and she'd blocked it out. Thankfully the movie has continuity with previous films by placing great actors in supporting roles, and amateurs as leads. Hopefully a different director will take the reigns in future, someone who remembers the original vision of the classic hero's journey depicted for the first time in space.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Not So Great Expectations,"Even though my expectations were low, oh how disappointing I found this movie. I suppose fame went to George's head, he felt that he was flawless, and he couldn't ""cash the check"".The most difficult is the fact that this movie had the chance to be pretty good. It moved along at an incredibly fast and exciting pace right from the start. I had goosebumps for the first 20 minutes. Unfortunately there were some real bombs throughout.I don't mind Jar-Jar so much. What makes me squirm are things like the whiney Jedi council (especially Yoda) who demonstrates nothing impressive especially when testing Anakin with that dumb little etch-a-scetch. The Jedi council should have been one of the best scenes in the movie! And some of the action sequences were so poorly directed they were reminiscent of the A-Team. (However, Darth Maul was so good he made the Jedis look like the high school colorguard.)Lucas was great in his day with American Graffiti, THX, and Star Wars and it suggests that maybe a younger director breath life into this story. But then I remember Irvin Kershner who had no trouble directing an excellent Empire Strikes Back at age 57!I would love it if Irvin came out and directed some of the new episodes...sorry George. You were truly great once! I don't care what people say about the bad dialog and bad acting in Star Wars. That movie was beautiful! Please get back to your roots and keep in simple. You're losing your vision. Remember don't worry about anybody else, just do your own thing and people will love you.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Disappointing, but still good despite Jar Jar","A solid film, with several big problems. Firstly Jar Jar is the most irritating character in cinema history (well, at least since Chris Tucker's last film role). This kind of brain-damaged Teletubbie-esque amphibian is obviously aimed at the kiddies, and makes all but the least cynical of adults grind their teeth with hate. But the kids in the cinema seemed to like him, and that's all that matters.Other things are wrong, such as slightly wooden acting, dodgy pacing, baddies with racist Japanese accents and a criminal underuse of the film's best character Darth Maul. But despite these problems, the film is still a solid segment of the saga, although possibly the worst of the lot (except the holiday special, obviously).",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"entertaining, but not up to the hype","First of all, I have to say that I am a big star wars fan and loved episodes 4, 5 and 6.  So naturally I was extremely excited about the prequels and was waiting impatiently for this movie months before it came out.  When it finally did, I went to go see it and came out with an empty feeling.  It was still Star Wars.  It had the Star Wars feel, it had the Star Wars characters but it did not have the same depth and meaning as the older Star Wars movies.  It felt like one long commercial promoting george lucas' technological capabilities and the countless number of Star Wars merchandise ready to be sold on the shelves of every store.  I gave this movie a 7 because it was fun to watch at times and set the stage for a potentially interesting episode 2.  For every Star Wars fan it's a must, but for those who have little interest in it, don't expect a great movie, just go in and watch a great exhibition of modern computer technology.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"A good movie, but an even greater disappointment","George Lucas must have too many butt-kissers in his camp these days. Either that or just delusional followers who blindly take all of his ideas as gems. That is the only explanation I can think of for how and why Jar Jar Binks was allowed to permeate this movie. I loved Star Wars when I was 7 and I didn't need some cheesy muppitt to convince me. I thought a lesson had been learned with the ending of Return of the Jedi.  But mistakes are frequently repeated I suppose; it's just a little surprising at this level.  You do not need infantile characters to appeal to a young audience! I and many others are living proof.But what is even sadder is that this computerized character was the most animated of the bunch; the two Jedis and the princess.  Jedis are supposed to be stoic I suppose, but c'mon, that shouldn't mean they have to be dull! And the princess? She could have been so much more interesting, in my opinion; her personality could have used a little more fire.  I don't know, they seemed a little on the tired side to me. They seemed not much more than spectators. No life, charisma, not much force.  This in spite of the fact that I really like all three of the actors.   Lucas might as well get on with it and just hire the 'players' from Final Fantasy.Exceptions: Samuel L. Jackson, Yoda, and the Emperor.  I thought they played their parts quite well; they brought that old feeling that I got from the old movies.  Darth Maul could have used a few more lines, and a little less Halloween makeup from The Party Store. I've seen more convincing makeup on television.In spite of the above, I still enjoyed the movie.  The effects were good, and ther were some great action scenes.  And there were some cool ideas and background of how many of the characters (like C3PO) were first introduced. I also liked the basic storyline about Darth Vader; it has potential to lead into some really cool stuff.  Hopefully, that's what will happen...Until then I plan to find more compelling and entertaining science fiction on the television: FarScape, Lexx, etc.6 out of 10",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Could have been better with all that money,Honestly I am more impressed by The Matrix as for the original visual fx.(bullet shadows etc.) Except the Race scene and underwater city it gave nothing to me. Too much animated character and enough Jar Jar talk!!!Almost like a cartoon. Also -sci-fi classic- one minute cuts bores already.,6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
numbed despite 3D,"The ticket clerk offered me a free toy which I declined. I felt as embarrassed and idiotic as Jar Jar.I ordered a *small* coffee figuring I would need a boost to get through this; fortunately they gave me a somewhat gigantic one.I heard a couple of voices far behind me in the large theatre otherwise I was the only one there.The application of any stars here at all are for the hard working tech folks and the great orchestral players not to mention the long-suffering extras in the grandstand and so on.Did George Lucas actually write this script all by himself? At least he could have farmed out the comedy to someone, anyone. Shandling? Lewis? Larry David? How much did this film cost? Good Grief...The only enjoyable element of this film was John Williams' piece of string writing at the very end of the closing credits.Awright, I did my *duty* and saw the thing, yaaawwwnnnn......",3.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
A truly great epic from the Pod Race on...,"The grandeur of the film starts at the Pod Race. The pace picks up and the movie takes off becoming a film worthy of belonging to the Star Wars epic. The story stumbles on its way there. It seems too fast, too cutty. The story doesn't give itself time to unfold. Anakin (who's acting is one of the film's shortcomings, next to the unintelligibility of Jar Jar Binks) falls in love too quickly with Padme, for instance. He too into her with not so much as a moment of contemplation leading up to it. The settings shift without flow. The characters are not being built so much as displayed. It's not until the Pod Race that you're comfortable enough with the characters to fall in love with them. For then on perfection takes over and the magic engulfs you. Unlike most people, I don't hate Jar Jar as much as I had too much trouble understanding what he says. He almost needs subtitles. But even his mumbling clears up after the Pod Race. All in all, I liked the film and will probably see it again, but felt like I had to get into it rather then being yanked in.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
OH... MY... GOD! What have they done?!,"How... why... who... WHAT DID THEY DO? ""Star Wars"" in the now is like waiting for a disaster to happen! They destroyed the story. How could they?

Characters that are dull and boring. The plot did not put me on the edge of my seat, thank you very much. I do not get how this movie has a rating of 6.5. How?! It doesn't even deserve my kind rating of 1. But unfortunatly, that's all IMDB gives me to rate. And if 1 is ""awful"", this is being to merciful. This was beyond awful.

all I could have hoped for,"With all the hype it received, it would have been easy for Star Wars Episode One: The Phantom Menace to fall flat on its face.  Luckily, it did not do so.

I also enjoyed the way that the foreshadowing was employed, and I left the theaters psyched for episodes 2 and 3 already.

Change of heart,"I saw Star Wars Episode I for the last time on 12:01 Wednesday morning. I came out of the theater disappointed. I decided to go see it again from a different perspective - that of someone going to see the film on it's own merits, and not comparing it to the other three Star Wars films, and not from being the Star Wars fanatic that I am.After leaving the theater for the second time, I was very happy with the movie. I'm not sure why I was not happy with the movie the first time - the movie was not what I thought it was going to be. This is not a bad thing, just not what I expected.Not to say there were parts of the movie I did not like. I still wish Darth Maul would have been in the movie for more than 15 minutes, and that Jar Jar Binks would have been thrown in a meat grinder, but overall, the second time is a charm.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Plot needs reworking, but a good film","The Phantom Menace is quite a mixed bag. There are some incredible visuals with the likes of Naboo and the Gungan city, as well as quite possibly the best lightsaber duel in all of Star Wars, but the plot lacks development and does not fit well with the purpose of the film. It was supposed to be all about Anakin's life and the beginning of his journey to becoming a Jedi and eventually a Sith, but he plays an insignificant role in the film, and his script is not very well written. Jake Lloyd actually did quite well with what he was given, but Anakin needed more importance in the film, and I think they should have made him older, maybe just younger than Luke was in A New Hope, so there would be less of a jump going into Episode II.The story was more focused on politics than anything else; the politics itself was creditable but was unnecessary in a Star Wars film; we're here to see the beginning of Anakin's journey to the Dark Side, we don't care about the taxation of trade routes.Jar Jar is another unnecessary addition to the film; he can be annoying but is bearable and doesn't ruin the film, so if you're one of those people who went after Ahmed Best then shame on you.The best thing about this film is Darth Maul. His character design was perfect for an ominous Sith Lord, and he should have appeared more in the film and had more to say.Duel of the Fates really rescues the film from disaster and is considered by many to be the best duel in Star Wars film or TV. The choreography is incredible, and a massive step up from the originals, the scenery is stunning in the refinery complex, and the emotion is perfect.Overall, this film has some of the best moments in Star Wars, but also some very bad and boring moments. Its is definitely worth watching though, and it is enjoyable.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Lucas is a Genius,"Star Wars Episode 1: The Phantom Menace is the greatest movie of the Star Wars Saga when it comes to the visual world that is created.  The original is still the best of the saga, but this movie proves better than the Return of the Jedi.  The story of young Anakin Skywalker has been 16 years in the waiting.  This movie does live up to the hype, but remember it is still a kids movie.  There are a bunch of little things that Lucas adds to this movie that stay in the tradition of the original movies.

"Artistically inferior to it's predecessors, but somehow is still awesome to watch.","Although it's very much agreed that this 'Episode 1' is a far cry from the original Star Wars trilogy, there are a number of set pieces that are truly astounding (visually at least at any rate).  In particular the huge establishing shots of the Podrace Arena, the marching Gungan Army, the Galactic Senate and the Final Victory Parade.  It's worth at least one repeat viewing for these alone.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Ehh this movie is ok,"This movie has a weird tone thanks to the awkward performances mixing with the grand world building, epic soundtrack, great action and a basic plot that drags on honestly if this movie was cut down to 90-100 minutes and maybe provided some motivation for the villains it'd be a 7-8 at least",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Can't wait for the rest,"First of all I must say that I am a Star Wars fan and therefore am biased towards the movie.With that said and done, I think that every critic who has slammed this movie should be fired. Most critics make two points which I will handle in turn:1. Too many special effects -- it is true that this movie revolves around special effects. However, these are breathtaking to say the least and are what make it a great movie instead of just a mediocre one.2. Not enough human emotion -- this entirely not true. Humans are seen clearly to triumph over robots. Robots are entirely unable to fight humans and the force.REMEMBER: When watching the movie, one must remember that it is only the first of a trilogy. The plot and the characters build up over all three. Therefore, any emotion lacking in the movie is due entirely to the fact that the producer has enough sense to let us explore new traits of the characters' character in the second and third movie.CONS: it does take a while to get goingGENERAL VERDICT: Not to be missed on any condition. Watch on the biggest screen with the best sound system you can find.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Good, visually strong, SF/Fantasy film","This highly anticipated first chapter of the Star Wars Saga couldn't live up to the media hype that built up before its release but, overall, it is a good film.  The small, relatively minor conflict depicted here actually only sets the political stage for all the films to follow but it is still compelling enough to make this picture interesting.  Also Lucas does take a more leisurely approach at the beginning of this film than in any of the other Star Wars films but the second half of the film takes off and is as exciting as the finales of the three previous movies.   The highlights of this film are the visuals which really brings these exotic worlds to life; the pod race which was obvious inspired by the chariot race of ""Ben Hur""; the end lightsaber battle which makes the previous saber battles look lethargic in comparison; and the incredible sound effects which are what I like best about all the Star Wars films.   The low point is Lucas' pandering again to children (like he did with the Ewoks in ""Return of the Jedi"") by adding a silly, annoying character, Jar Jar Binks, to the mix - he comes across as a bad mixture of both Roger Rabbit and the ""Lost in Space"" monkey. Chalk this character up to the fact that Lucas makes three times as much money on merchandise than he does on ticket sales.   But, with the exception of Jar Jar, this really is a good film.  Also, if you do go to see it, be sure to drive the extra miles to see it in digital sound - it makes a very big difference in the enjoyment of this film.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Good concept, Bad story.","Star Wars: Episode I, telling the story of that occurred before the first trilogy. The story of how little boy turns out to be the most powerful Jedi, Darth Vader. Not a bad concept, but how the story has been told is not quite impressive as the first trilogy. It was quite entertaining, but not quite up to the standard of the original. This would have disappointed many fans, especially when they have been waiting for over 16 years and after all the publicist and advertisement they have seen.

It certainly had the highest of expectations which didn't help and it isn't as awful as critics would make you feel.  You should see it, but don't kill yourself if you're a fan of Star Wars to like it.  Not every episode is going to be something you cherish forever, and I certainly won't be with this one.
