Death Or Glory - Just Another Story,"In terms of story this is on the surface at least, the simplest thing Kubrick ever made. However in terms of the technical aspect, it must have been one of his most challenging. The plot is basically about how greed, arrogance and ignorance can easily become the ruin of a man. The story itself is well told, but mostly quite simple as I said. The humor keeps us interested in the story, as does its undeniable visual beauty. It is not a stretch to say that this must be among the most beautiful looking films ever made. Every scene is filmed in all natural light, whether it be by sun or fire, and the landscapes and architecture handpicked by Kubrick himself are amazing. As in all Kubrick films, so much attention to small details equates to a great result in the end. Spielberg himself has called this film ""possibly the most beautifully shot film in history."".In terms of story, it's entertaining, in terms of it's technical achievement, the film is a landmark. Even for all the story's simplicity, there is a startling statement in the film that certainly can give the viewer real pause and thought. The finality of this world, the equality of all things in the end. It is certainly an interesting, powerful and very humbling down to earth observation. It is the kind of worldly observation that could perhaps lead some people to ruin, and yet lead others to strive for perfection. Perhaps that is part of Kubrick's thinking here, a Kubrickian challenge if you will, as he certainly was always an artist that was challenging his viewers. That through this observation people may become more aware of what they're leaving behind in this world...as one day, we will all equally be gone. For all the things written about this film, it is probably not nearly as unimportant of a story as many critics have said of it. Then again, critics and moviegoers alike have long been trying to catch up to Stanley, and never the other way around. 8.5/10.",8.0,Anonymous,History
A film so easily dismissed,"In the midst of the many wonderful films made by Stanley Kubrick, it is strange to note how rarely people mention ""Barry Lyndon"".The film portrays an unusual young Irish man, Redmond Barry, and his endeavours as he is forced to leave his home and tries to make good his life elsewhere. His life away from home starts out as a career in the British Army; only to evolve in surprising ways and lead to as different places as a position of trust within the Prussian Army and later a title of nobility, gained by what our time can only measure as rather disgraceful means.Some consider Barry Lyndon a slow and tedious film  and it is in deed past three hours in length, but this is because of the artistic flow of a film that strays not only to tell a tale about a man who is by no means neither hero nor villain, but also a film which is in no hurry and takes the time for every detail to sink into the mind and heart of the viewer. Some of the scenic images in ""Barry Lyndon"" are in themselves pieces of art, rendered with a passion for the landscapes and the man-made structures within them.The myth that all scenes were recorded using no artificial lighting no doubt stems from the very realistic lights during indoor takes, and some of them truly did not feature artificial light. This is but one of the many details that so easily conveys a sense of a realistic portray of the era; the 18th century and the time after the seven-year war in the later half of the century. The impressive atmosphere and the wonderfully picturesque scenarios along with the fact that the entire plot moves at a calm pace makes this film a very pleasant experience.""Barry Lyndon is"", amidst Kubricks' many masterpieces, a film so easily dismissed due to length and the fact that it is overshadowed by others, but I deeply recommend this film to anyone who would like to see a film both for the plot line, the story and the pure enjoyment of the images presented. Stanley Kubrick made many great films  and this one is most definitely one of them! KimotoCat",10.0,Anonymous,History
""" good or bad, handsome or ugly, rich or poor, they are all equal now"".","The beauty, the depth, and the mystery of this film are unsurpassable - what Kubrick was doing with light is just a miracle. Special lenses were designed to shoot interiors and exteriors in natural light. In one scene Barry (Ryan O'Neil) was having a dinner with a German woman who was feeding her baby and the candle light made the whole scene look like a Caravaggio's painting. This is just one of many scenes. Each of them is perfection and harmony. Costumes and sets were crafted in the era's design. Age of Enlightenment with its gallantry, wars, and duels, had been recreated in the film with the precision of the celebrated landscape and portrait masters of the period such as Thomas Gainsborough; Sir Joshua Reynolds, founder of the Royal Academy of Arts; George Romney to name just a few. If nothing else, watching BL is pure aesthetic delight - and there is one man who responsible for it, Stanley Kubrick. If ever divine film was made, ""Barry Lyndon"" was it and Kubrick could've quoted the Bible - ""God looked at everything he had made, and he found it very good"".I've read the comments and articles that call ""Barry Lyndon"" cold, slow, boring, ""the collection of pretty pictures', ""flawed"" masterpiece, and the most ridiculous one, ""glittering ornament with a hollow center"". I simply can't understand it. ""Barry Lyndon"" is the most compelling and compassionate realization of the inevitable finality of everything in this world which was presented by the visionary director with elegant sensual melancholy. Stanley Kubrick known for his detached, seemingly remote and non-sentimental style chose to reach out to his viewer directly during the epilogue, ""It was in the reign of George III that the aforesaid personalities lived and quarreled, good or bad, handsome or ugly, rich or poor, they are all equal now"". I don't recall any other movie that would illustrate the old wisdom, ""everything will pass"" in such sublime and deeply moving way.",10.0,Anonymous,History
I can't believe that there are people who find this dull.,"In fact it's one of Kubrick's most gripping pictures, with a narrative drive second only to that of ""Dr. Strangelove"" (and it's unquestionably a more glorious creation than, say, anything he made in the 1950s).  English director Michael Powell (while attributing a similar failing to one of his own works) says that Kubrick fell into ""the trap of the picturesque"", but while I admire Powell as a creator, the judgment is absurd: at the VERY least, each lush image shows us people not just occupying a part of the screen but inhabiting a world, and tells us much about their relation to that world.  Many shots are indeed amazing and beguile the eye, but they don't have the effect they do simply because they would make nice postcards.THIS, I feel sure (without having read Thackeray), is the proper way to adapt a long story from novel to screen.  Each scene is either allowed as much time as it needs to make its point and its impact, or it's cut altogether - you won't catch Kubrick skating too quickly over his material for no better reason than to fit it all in.  The third-person narration (consisting of witty, beautifully crafted sentences - it's about time I did read Thackeray) almost performs a kind of dance with the images, gliding in just when we need it, taking a step back when we don't.  (So rarely is even third-person narration used so well.)  And as always, Kubrick's musical sense is unerring.  My impression at the time was that I was listening to mid-eighteenth century music that gave way to pieces from the classical era as the hero started to move in higher and higher circles.  I was more or less right.  But then I noticed Schubert's name in the credits - and I realised with a start that I'd been listening to, had even started tapping my feet to, a Schubert piece I was familiar with, without the anachronism registering.It's a pity Kubrick stopped making epics after this.  Look at the ones he's responsible for: ""Spartacus"" (not a project Kubrick was fond of, admittedly, but still the most magnificent of all Roman epics) ""2001"" (the most magnificent of ALL epics), and ""Barry Lyndon"".  The last of the three is by no means a poor cousin.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Great Paintings Come To Life,"Some movies - I wish there were more of them - simply look like a series of great paintings. This film has that look. You could freeze-frame many of the scenes and swear you were looking at a Gainsborough, a Vermeer, a Hogarth or similar work of art by one the great artists of three to five centuries ago. It's just beautiful.For that, we have Director Stanley Kubrick and Photographer John Alcott to thank. Being a three-hour movie, there are plenty of wonderful shots to admire, too. In addition, the costumes are lavish and authentic and the scoring is notable. It's no accident that Oscars were garnered for art/set direction, cinematography, costume design and scoring. Yeah, if you enjoy classical music, you'll really enjoy the soundtrack, too, under the guidance of conductor Leonard Roseman.Not to be overlooked is the fine acting and the interesting and underrated story. I say ""underrated"" because this film, from what I've read, bored a lot of people and and it was a box-office flop. That's too bad because, frankly, I found the story (outside of the first 10--15 minutes) to be fascinating. As I watched, I kept wondering what strange occurrences will happen next to the lead character, ""Redmond Barry/Barry Lyndon,"" played beautifully by Ryan O'Neal. (For most of the movie, he's called ""Redmond Barry,"" so I will refer to him as that.)Overall, this was a low-key adventure story about the rise-and-fall of a ""scoundrel"" back in late 18th century Englishman. ""Mr. Barry"" is an Irishmen living in England who winds up dealing with a number of people: Irish, English, Prussian, French. His dealings with these people are bizarre at times. While he mainly is shown doing what he can to promote himself, for either monetary gain and prestige of a name and power, he's not all bad. There is a compassionate side to him, but it only shows itself in small doses. It makes him all the more interesting to watch, because you don't always know how he's going to react to his circumstances, which change radically every few years.We witness his rise to prominence and then his fall when his ""sins begin to find him out,"" as the Bible would describe. It's quite a roller coaster ride.This is an emotional, involving story, and a feast for the eyes and ears. It's quite different, too, certainly not the average fare from Kubrick. I can only hope this comes out on a high-definition disc some day. Admirers of this film need to see this in all its glory.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Opulent costume drama from the great filmmaker,"Kubrick's adaptation of Thackeray's Barry Lyndon sharply divides fans of the great director's work, as the languid pace and seemingly interminable running time -- not to mention Ryan O'Neal's questionable performance in the title role -- are cherished by some and deplored by others.  Little argument will be made against John Alcott's Academy Award-winning cinematography or Ken Adam's production design, however, and Kubrickian motifs are manifest in the gallery of characters' wide-ranging displays of cowardice, guile, duplicity, avarice, jealousy, greed, and cruelty.  Marisa Berenson is terribly short-changed in her role as the Lady Lyndon, but a number of other performers are given the opportunity to create a handful of memorable moments -- especially Arthur O'Sullivan (albeit briefly) as the charming, intelligent highwayman and Patrick Magee as the Chevalier.  Love it or hate it, Barry Lyndon will remain essential viewing for aficionados of the director, who enjoys taking his usual shots at the more discouraging aspects of human behavior.",,Anonymous,History
See The Pretty Pictures,"The same things that make ""Barry Lyndon"" interesting are what make it problematic. Long drawn-out scenes, lingering close-ups of stiff-faced actors, no rooting interest, a sudden personality shift (for the worse) in the lead character, and minute attention to period detail that seems director Stanley Kubrick's main reason for making this.Kubrick shoots his 18th-century costume drama, based on the William Makepeace Thackeray novel, with nods in the direction not of other filmmakers but rather period painters like Gainsborough and Hogarth. His frame, often moving but slightly in the course of a scene, captures moments of wondrous, intense beauty which seem to defy gravity in their not-quite static state, such as a woman in her bath or a man riding across a country path. For that, it is a unique film, one that transfixes many still.Still, it's a hard film to love, at least for me, starting with the main character, a young Irishman named Redmond Barry (Ryan O'Neal) forced to flee his homeland after a duel who gets himself trapped in not one but two armies in the middle of the Seven Years' War. He escapes with a tricky gambler to Belgium where he meets Lady Lyndon (Marisa Berenson) who falls in love with him and offers him an opportunity to rise in the highest realms of society, if only he can control his mendacity and bitter temper.Not a lot to love there, and some say it's either O'Neal's fault or Kubrick's for casting him. O'Neal is in typically wooden form, but this is one film that serves such an acting style, as the cast here converses less in dialogues than colloquies while barely moving so much as an eyebrow so as not to disturb Kubrick's delicately candlelit interiors. O'Neal surprises on occasion, especially late in the film when he delivers a crying scene as powerful as Russell Crowe's in ""Gladiator."" Once you get past his weak Irish accent, you may find him as good a man for the job here as anyone.There's also nice character work by Murray Melvin as the dour minister Mr. Runt, Leon Vitali as Lady Lyndon's son by a prior marriage, and Steven Berkoff, unrecognizable as the same man who menaced Eddie Murphy in ""Beverly Hills Cop"", as a foppish dandy who trifles with Barry to his regret. Patrick Magee, often over-the-top on screen, nicely underplays his part of the gambler, Barry's tutor for a time. Kubrick's work with the child actors here showcases his exceptional, undercommented work in that department.This is one Kubrick film where there is little overacting. It's hard to overact when you can't even move. Kubrick is so bent on making with his pretty pictures that any droplets of vitality dribble off the screen. Audience identification, too, is hard, except I think some of the charm of this film is in how alien it is, presenting a world we think we know in an askew but somehow more real-seeming way than ever before.It's a triumph in ""Barry Lyndon"" how fine and layered a visual scheme Kubrick is able to put on screen, and the story, especially in its first half when Barry is on the rise, has its compelling moments. A mordant narration by Michael Hordern that carries on for the length of the film seems intrusive at first but gradually turns out a rather sublime counterpoint to the action on screen. You come to need Hordern after a while. At a little over three hours, one feels like one is sitting through Barry's wastrel life in real time. Some may see that as an accomplishment, but you can only stare so long at a painting, even a masterpiece, before yawning sets in. It sets in more quickly here.",6.0,Anonymous,History
The World of Stanley Kubrick: A young rapscallion makes good in 18th century Europe.,"Barry Lyndon (1975) has to be Stanley Kubrick's most realized project that he has ever taken. A big task for the maverick director. For a film like this to be made during the free wheeling seventies had to take some big stones. One must admire Mr. Kubrick for even trying to produce and direct such a complex and expensive film that had all the ear markings of a financial and personal disaster. Not only did Kubrick manage to out do his last epic ""2001"" but he has created a movie that not only showcases the untapped acting abilities of Ryan O'Neil, but a beautifully lensed film that uses minimal lighting , gorgeous sets, perfect balance, positioning and meticulous timing. I have never seen such a magnificent film such as this one. Every shot and frame plays out like an eighteenth century oil painting.A young Irish man of lower class has the strangest quirk of luck. After participating in an illegal duel, young Barry is forced to flee from his home village. After being accosted by some gentlemanly highway robbers, Barry winds up cross country and becomes a conscripted soldier. Rising in rank, Barry is sent to fight in the Seven's Year War. Whilst in battle he watches his friends and fellow soldiers being slaughtered in combat due to poor tactics and leadership. Having enough of this life of hardship and struggle, Barry uses his god given talents to do what he has to do in order to survive and become a man of proper social standing.I was very impressed with this movie. I've put off watching this film until recently. Some have told me how long and boring this movie was. Others have said it was pretty self serving and not worth watching. But after seeing part of it on T.C.M., I just had to find a copy of my own. The film is over three hours in length but they go by very quickly because Barry's story is so captivating. Kubrick poured his heart and soul into this film. The results are on the screen. He's clearly a master film maker. His reputation is cemented forever with this movie. Ryan O'Neil impressed the hell out me with his role as Barry Lyndon. He gives the character some dignity and depth that no other actor could have possibly given to the title role.Overall I would have to give this film one of my highest recommendations. This is one of my top ten films of all time. If people tell you not to watch this masterpiece ignore them. I advise you to get a copy and enjoy. For a film like this you need to set aside a weekend afternoon to fully appreciate a film such as this. Believe me you will not regret it.Highest recommendation possible.It doesn't matter whether you watch it on D.V.D. or V.C.D. because the transfers are excellent on either format.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Irish social climber,"Acclaimed by many as Stanley Kubrick's finest, I think Barry Lyndon is a good film that misses being a great one due to some truly bad casting. I can only imagine such folks as Peter O'Toole, Richard Harris, and Albert Finney were off doing other projects that Ryan O'Neal was selected for the title role. Try as he might O'Neal is just way too American to fit the part of an 18th century Irishman who wishes to rise in society and not care how he does it.I have to say that Kubrick's recreation of the 18th century in both its look and mores is nothing short of magnificent. Small wonder that Barry Lyndon won Oscars for Costume Design, Best Music Score, Cinematography and Art&Set Design. The technical aspect he nailed down beautifully.As for O'Neal in 18th century Ireland and assuming he's a Protestant there are still limited means of opportunity. Seduced by Gay Hamilton his first love, she abandons him for marriage to a wealthy British officer. And when O'Neal refuses to leave she and her family play a very interesting trick which I won't reveal to force him to leave.After time in both the British and Prussian armies during the Seven Years War and some lucrative years at the gaming tables, O'Neal has his turn at seduction when he beds Marisa Berenson while she's still married to the titled Frank Middlemass. Then he dies and O'Neal weds her and her money, but earns the undying enmity of her son Leon Vitali. That in fact seals his fate.O'Neal and Berenson do have a child of their own and seeing the scenes between O'Neal and his own son made me think that Thackerey's treatment of the father/son relationship was the model for what Margaret Mitchell did with Rhett Butler and Bonnie Blue Butler in Gone With The Wind.Kubrick opted for a full treatment of Thackerey's novel just as David O. Selznick did with Gone With The Wind. Unfortunately Ryan O'Neal just did not fit the title role as Clark Gable did with Rhett Butler.",7.0,Anonymous,History
I agree with Scorcese,"Martin Scorcese reportedly considers this to be Kubrick's best film. I must agree, and I would say it's his best by some fair margin. I've never seen a film with photography that even begins to approach that in Barry Lyndon. But everyone mentions the photography. The three things that most decisively set this film apart from all of Kubrick's others and really haven't been mentioned enough are its enormous heart, its uncompromising spirit, and the way it seems to suspend time over and over again, simultaneously standing still yet flowing along easily, almost breathlessly. If you watch it expecting A Clockwork Orange or The Shining, you'll be very disappointed and may end up calling it long and boring, but if you set aside an entire evening and surrender yourself totally to its magic, I swear you'll be looking for yourself in Stunland a few hours later. I's time to treat yourself to Barry Lyndon. You may be shocked at discovering what's been there for so long.",10.0,Anonymous,History

The most elegant and exquisite film ever,"The genius Stanley Kubrick has truly outdone himself by crafting this masterpiece. After viewing A Space Odyssey, I thought there were no films more beautiful, but the breathtaking painting-like scenes of Barry Lyndon paired with music exquisitely chosen by Kubrick are simply stunning. There are some who may say that this film is too long or stale, but I say, that this film must be savoured slowly, and that one must enjoy it for what it is, which is almost like a series of ethereal paintings, one after another. Watch this film not for the end, but watch it and live with the fact that every scene is a part of the whole, and that the wholeness and oneness in itself is beautiful. Say, if we only watched movies for the ending, then composers who only wrote finales would be the greatest. All you must do is to simply sit down and relax, then, nothing else except absolute enchantment can possibly follow.",10.0,Anonymous,History
"Lavish, engrossing, picaresque","(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book ""Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!"" Get it at Amazon.)Stanley Kubrick's beautifully opulent production takes many liberties with William Makepeace Thackeray's picaresque romance, The Memoirs of Barry Lyndon, Esq (1843), narrated in the first person depicting events from the eighteenth century. In particular, Redmond Barry who becomes Barry Lyndon, is something of an admirable rake, whereas in Thackeray's novel he is a braggart, a bully and a scoundrel. No matter. Kubrick, in keeping with a long-standing filmland tradition, certainly has license, and Thackeray won't mind.Ryan O'Neal is the unlikely star, and he does a good job, rising from humble Irish origins to the decadence of titled wealth, employing a two-fisted competence in the manly arts, including some soldiering, some thievery at cards and a presumed consummate skill in the bedroom. Marisa Berenson plays Lady Lyndon, whom Barry has managed to seduce; and when her elderly husband dies, she marries Barry thus elevating his social and economic station in life. But Barry is rather clumsy at playing at peerage, and bit by bit manages to squander most of the Lyndon fortune until his stepson, Lord Bullingdon (Leon Vitali) grows old enough to do something about it.This really is a gorgeous movie thanks to the exquisite sets and costumes and especially to John Alcott's dreamy cinematography and a fine score by Leonard Rosenman. The 184 minutes go by almost without notice as we are engrossed in the rise and fall of Barry's fortunes. There is fine acting support from Patrick Magee as the Chevalier de Balibari and Leonard Rossiter as Captain Quinn, and a number of lesser players, who through Kubrick's direction bring to life Europe around the time of the Seven Years War (1754-1763) when decadence and aristocratic privilege were still in full flower.The script features two dueling scenes, the first showing the combatants firing at one another simultaneously at the drop of a white kerchief, the second has Barry and his stepson face each other ten paces apart, but due to the flip of a coin, the stepson fires first. Both scenes are engrossing as we see the loading of the pistols with powder, ball and ramrod, and we are able to note how heavy the pistols are and how difficult it must be to hit a silhouette at even a short distance. It is this kind of careful attention to directional detail that absorbs us in the action and makes veracious the story. Notice too the way the British soldiers march directly en mass toward the French guns. They actually used to fight battles that way! Also note the incredible pile of hair atop Lady Lyndon's head. Surely this is some kind of cinematic record.Bottom line: one of Kubrick's best, certainly his most beautiful film.",10.0,Anonymous,History
"A tale of love, war and power","While this is, in my opinion, not the best of Kubrick's films, it is in no way a bad film of his... some have claimed it is overlong and dull, but I don't think so. From what I've heard, it does the novel justice, and I believe that is what Kubrick went after, more than anything else. That is admirable, for a man who throughout his career was known for making unfaithful film adaptations of famous and popular novels, much to the dismay of the authors. The film perfectly presents everything from the time period in which it takes place... something that few, if any, other films have accomplished. It deals with the life of Redmond Barry, his ups and downs. The first half has us feeling sympathy with him, and shows his rise to a high position and gain the name Barry Lyndon, and everything that entitles. The second seems to turn us a little more against him, as he goes through the expected downfall that must always follow an unexpected rise to high life. Through the film he gets desensitized and careless. We follow him through most of his life, and an uneventful one it is not. As all other Kubrick films, the visual side is probably the most prominent one of the film, as he grants us several long looks at the beautiful sets and locales, and there are more than a few of his trademark shots slowly zooming out from the focus point to display the surroundings. The plot is great, and almost constantly developing. It is narrated with a good sense of irony and clever social satire on the time period. There's plenty of humor in the film to make the three hour run-time seem less long. The pacing is good and thorough without the film being slow(though I do admit that it isn't a film for those who are not used to long, visual films). The characters are well-written and credible. The acting is excellent all the way. Not even the child-actors seemed less than perfectly convincing. The costumes and sets are great. From what I understand, there is no detail in the film that is even slightly historically inaccurate. That is quite impressive for a film that takes place about a century and a half before it was made. I have heard of great deals of work done to keep many films accurate, but I don't believe one exists that manages to do so with such perfection as this. Even the very language that they speak is accurate. The special effects in the film also deserve mention here... for a film that is almost thirty years old, it's impeccable how believable and convincing the effects are... I couldn't tell how most of them were done. Kubrick was indeed one of the most brilliant directors ever... he was not only a master at his craft, he was also one of the most innovative and inspiring film-makers to have ever lived. I recommend this great piece of cinema to anyone who has an interest in the time period the film is set and any fan of Stanley Kubrick. Don't miss this one. Not his greatest, but a truly great one nonetheless. 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,History
Kubrick's true masterpiece,"I think Barry Lyndon is Stanley Kubrick's true masterpiece.

The Camera and the Stage,"When I was in high school, it was considered ""cool"" to watch Stanley Kubrick movies as they were seen as ""more enlightened forms of entertainment"" over stuff by Steven Spielberg and John Hughes.  If you didn't memorize the opening speech to Full Metal Jacket or hadn't seen Nicole Kidman in Eyes Wide Shut then you were rejected from the clique.  This was at the time when I was first viewing Kurosawa's Rashomon and Ran and accidentally came across this gem.  Sure, the rest of the gang would be quoting along with Alex DeLarge in A Clockwork Orange, but not one of them would dare sit down and watch this or 2001: A Space Odyssey.  Fools.Barry Lyndon is another sign of sheer genius on behalf of Kubrick.  Notice that in his career he is never concerned about making money, just creating an image and telling a story.  Imagine if Michael Bay did the same, he'd be out of the business in no time and having to sell his own movies at the Video Hut.  This movie is one of his better detailed (and yet mysteriously unsung) masterpieces that is so beautiful to look at that it almost becomes artistic pornography (in the sense of creating intense emotion).  This isn't to say that Barry Lyndon is vulgar.  By comparison to Eyes Wide Shut and The Shining, this is a kid's cartoon.Kubrick is once again a certified genius with his camera.  The elaborate and glamorous scenes ranging from duels to gardens and even just the opening prologue are beautifully rendered in a style reminiscent of Monet or other artists.  I found it interesting how Kubrick includes pigeons (doves?) in the final duel.  Perhaps John Woo gained some inspiration from this.The story is paper thin compared to 2001 and lacks much of the symbolism. In fact, it is very hard to either sympathize with Ryan O'Neil as the title character because of his lack of portrayal.  As a whole, none of the characters gain either support or disapproval because of their fleeting presence.  The sets and costume designs themselves become more of a character than the actors.  Thankfully, the story is not as convoluted as I expected.  It flows nicely and never gets boring because of the variety of powerful elements infused into it.First off, kudos to both Ken Adam and Vernon Dixon for their brilliant production design.  I loved what Ken did with Dr. Strangelove (smart move for him to ditch the Bond series for that).  John Alcott is one of Kubrick's lesser cinematographers, but he is still very talented here.  I'm certain that, if he had lived longer, Kubrick would've kept using him.  He is not as concerned about symmetry, that or the topics aren't, as the rest of Kubrick's work.  The biggest irony about Barry Lyndon would have to be that everyone in the categories EXCEPT Kubrick won an Oscar for their work.  I think the Academy has something of a grudge against him because of his superior quality of work.Overall, a phenomenal quality of film that they just don't make anymore.  I put this in my Top 10 required viewings for anyone who wants to be in film. Kubrick has transcended Shakespeare with this film.  4.5 out of 5 stars.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Gorgeous film,"Slow as molasses in January, and as sweet, while the camera lingers, soulfully kissing and savoring each moment. With immaculate precision of detail, Kubrick constructs his story of the hapless rogue Lyndon, portrayed by that expert at haplessness, Ryan O'Neal. Being no heavyweight in the acting department (but being cute enough to not have to be), the lengthy script about the rogue's success has been tailored in such a way that it flatters O'Neal's meager abilities. By method of Michael Hordem's sonorous narration, much of what O'Neal has to do is look handsome in his 18th century wardrobe. And that he does. The same is virtually true of co-star Marisa Berenson, who also co-starred in *Cabaret*. She is not an incredibly gifted actress, but she is indeed, an incredibly gifted beauty. So, she, too, must rely on her attractiveness. This is a time-honored Hollywood tradition that still lives and breathes today. If they gave Oscars for being attractive (and they do, don't they, Gwenyth?), this movie would have raked in the awards. It won four, anyway  Best Cinematography, Best Art Direction/Set Decoration, Best Costume Design and Best Musical Adaptation. Clocking in at 3 hours and 3 minutes, Kubrick fans are deeply conflicted over whether or not this is a masterpiece.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Magnificent costume drama from a master director,"""Barry Lyndon"", William Makepeace Thackeray's tale of the rise and fall of young Irish ne'er-do-well Redmond Barry in late 18th century Europe is brought to the scene by legendary auteur Stanley Kubrick. The cinematography is outstanding as Kubrick was experimenting with a number of high-aperture lenses originally developed for NASA to allow filming in minimal light, allowing him to shoot candle-lighted interiors in ambient light. There are also extremely long-distance wide-angle shots of the English countryside and long-distance pull-back zoom shots. There was some criticism of Ryan O'Neil's limited range as an actor when tasked to play such a complicated and central character and the long film (184 min) moves at a very languid pace (ultimately, not a lot happens), but I found the story interesting and the character development superb. Overall, ""Barry Lyndon"" is a beautifully crafted 'costume drama' and if a bit of patience is required to see the story through, it is well rewarded.",10.0,Anonymous,History

"Overlong, stiff, boring period drama","I'm a big fan of Kubrick's films, so back in the early days of DVDs I bought a boxed set that contained Dr. Strangelove, 2001, Clockwork Orange, The Shining, Full Metal Jacket, Lolita and Barry Lyndon. I had never seen the last two on that list, so I was really looking forward to watching them. Lolita, apart from the intentionally creepy subject matter, wasn't bad. And then I got to Barry Lyndon.On first viewing, I couldn't believe this movie was made by the same person who had made those others. What a dull, dragging, pretentious...did I mention dull?...movie this is. Now, I can handle deliberately slow-paced movies. I love 2001 and that film is almost as glacially paced as this one. But when that slow pace is coupled with a painfully boring story and wooden acting, it makes for a nearly unwatchable movie.It probably didn't help that Warner Brothers crammed a movie that's over three hours long onto a single DVD, resulting in sub-VHS video quality. But within half an hour I was looking at the clock, wondering how much longer the movie had to go. By the time it reached the intermission an hour and 40 minutes in, when most movies would have the decency to just end, I was ready to give up. But I soldiered on and watched the remaining hour and a half...I should have just gone with my original instincts.What made me return to this movie recently was that my wife is a big fan of 18th century period piece movies, so she had watched the last two thirds of this one on TV and asked me to get the DVD out so she could see the part she missed. She liked the detailed costumes and settings, and actually enjoyed the story. So I thought maybe my original opinion had been hasty and maybe I should give it another try.Nope, this movie is just awful. Such flat, bland acting and boring direction it's like the film was given some experimental treatment to extract any emotion, action or interest from it. The main character, Redmond Barry, rises from poverty in Ireland to wealth and high society in Europe not by any virtues of his own, but mostly through stupidity, cowardice and cheating. Once he finally steals the wife of a sickly Lord, he loses any likability he had in the first half of the movie and changes suddenly into a disagreeable jerk who mistreats his wife and cheats on her while squandering her family fortune. Why exactly are we supposed to care about this guy? I guess you can't expect perfection every time, but it's hard to believe the same guy who created Dr. Strangelove, 2001 and Clockwork Orange was responsible for this mess.Maybe it's just because I prefer sci-fi to period dramas, but I can't for the life of me understand why this clunker has an 8.1 average on IMDb and so many people have given it raving reviews. I can appreciate that the costumes, dialog and settings are all very authentic to the time period, but so what? That alone doesn't make for a good movie. This film should only be taken as a cure for insomnia.",3.0,Anonymous,History
One of the most beautiful movies ever made.,"This is certainly one of the most beautiful movies ever made. Beautiful is of course something totally different than saying 'this is the best movie ever made'. With beautiful I mean that the movie is superbly looking with flawless costumes and sets and impressive landscapes and camera-work. And please lets also not forget the beautiful and perfect use of classical music that was all rearranged by composer Leonard Rosenman, for which he also received an Oscar. Same goes for the flawless art-direction, cinematography and costume design. Truly all the Oscars that it at least deserved to get.""Barry Lyndon"" is a long movie, like Kubrick movies often are. A lot is happening in the story but it never gets to much because the story is told in a slow way. Almost the entire life of the character Redmond Barry/Barry Lyndon is told in the movie. As a sort of Irish 18th century Forrest Gump he travels and sees Europe through the eyes of many different sides. It gives a great view and feel of the 18th century Europe and the British 'gentleman' culture in particular.There is some absolutely stunning dialog in the movie. It's this typical old fashioned English polite way of talking that is used in this movie. It was a real joy to listen to and it provided some highly entertaining and memorable moments at times. The lines are all perfectly delivered by the fine actors. It was also great to see Pat Roach in this movie. Pat Roach is known for playing almost every of the big thugs in all the Indiana Jones movies. It's funny, I didn't recognized him by his face or voice but I did by his style of fighting. He fought in the same manner as he later did in ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" during the airplane fight.The story is told slowly and beautifully and is all beautiful narrated by Michael Hordern. You'll never be bored while watching this movie, I can guarantee that. There is simply too much happening in this movie to allow that.An absolutely beautiful movie that also is an absolute must see.10/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",10.0,Anonymous,History
Kubrick and Thackeray; on the same page,"Although the choice of stars in some movies seemed odd at the time they were made, over the years, they have grown into their roles.Ryan O'Neal in Kubrick's ""Barry Lyndon"" is a classic example. Back in the 70's he was a pretty big star, but seemed connected to more lightweight fare. It was a surprise when he ended up in a major film from Stanley Kubrick.These days, he doesn't carry the baggage that surrounded him back then and now seems quite an inspired choice to play Redmond Barry, a brash, impulsive, Irish opportunist during the Georgian era in England and Ireland. After many adventures, he rises from lowly beginnings to become a gentleman of means, only to slide back down again in an even more spectacular fall.Along the way he marries a beautiful widow, Lady Lyndon (Marissa Berenson) and makes an arch enemy of his stepson, Lord Bullingdon (Leon Vitali).Kubrick wrote the screenplay from William Makepeace Thackeray's novel. Thackeray had a witty turn of phrase - for example, at one point in the novel, Redmond Barry beats the living daylights out of young Lord Bullingdon, which Thackeray refers to as ""administering a correction"". Kubrick catches Thackeray's satirical tone and the script is full of wry, Thackeray-inspired observations on the human condition. Apart from anything else, the script itself is an impressive achievement.Thackeray wrote the novel in the first person from Redmond Barry's point of view whereas Kubrick uses the voice of an anonymous narrator, speaking in the third person. Although narration can sometimes seem a lazy way of telling a story in a film, it works perfectly here; we find ourselves waiting for the commentator to put Barry's often-painful experiences into perspective.Kubrick changed the story a great deal, without losing the essential themes. I can't help feeling that in a couple of areas he actually improved it, especially the ending, which in the novel is rather meandering - instead of the decisive duel of the film, Barry's fortunes run down, and he eventually lands in prison after being given ""a tremendous castigation"" by Lord Bullingdon. Kubrick tightens the whole thing and that long, final confrontation is one of the most powerful scenes in the film.This movie has a brilliant look whether indoors or out, night or day. What an amazing talent Kubrick was. Jack Nicholson once said of him, ""Everybody pretty much acknowledges he's The Man, but I still feel that underrates him"". He was a guy from New York who could embrace British literature and history, and produce such a believable work as this - it was almost as though he had Thackeray himself sitting in a canvas chair beside him acting as technical adviser.The true genius of the movie is in how Kubrick captures the period perfectly, maintains that beautifully measured pace, and yet delivers a film that is full of wit and tension from beginning to end.",10.0,Anonymous,History
One of Kubrick's best and most misunderstood,"Not his best(2001), but Barry Lyndon is a beautiful film that is so easily dismissed. I am fond of Stanley Kubrick's movies, and I honestly think Barry Lyndon is one of his best. I am not sure about it being underrated, but it is almost certainly misunderstood. Yes it is long, and yes it is slow. The length didn't bother me, and neither did the pace actually. The slow pacing as others have said is deliberate, it is essential to the rhythm of this film. Even if you can't adjust to the film's pace, so many other things compensate, especially the authentic period look, the ravishingly beautiful photography, Kubrick's superb direction and a hypnotizing music score. The story is well constructed, as is the dialogue, while the acting is fine. Ryan O'Neal and Marissa Berenson have often been criticised, but I think their bloodlessness and vacancy are a strength rather than a weakness. That aside, Leonard Rossiter, Hardy Kruger and especially Leon Vitali give fine supporting performances, while the climatic duel scene is definitive and the narration from Michael Hordern is excellent. So all in all, actually an excellent film. 10/10 Bethany Cox",10.0,Anonymous,History
"Gorgeous, brilliant, ironic, lifeless.","Goes down as Kubrick's Last Great Movie. (Though seeing as how he made only three more movies, it's not as if there was a long decline.) *Barry Lyndon* was a return to form, after that wretched *Clockwork Orange* -- meaning, he refrains here from allowing his general misanthropy to get the better of his judgment. The director managed to relocate a sense of rueful pity for humanity with this work.Kubrick takes the old tale of the Rake's Progress and transforms it into something altogether new. Based on an unimportant (and unread) early novel by Thackeray, *Barry Lyndon* chronicles the rise of a middle-class Irish lad from British soldier to professional gambler to master of a great estate via an advantageous marriage. It's set in the 18th century, beginning roughly with the Seven Years War and ending rather ominously in 1789 (Kubrick tantalizes us with this important date at the end of the film, but we're not sure what to make of it). While Kubrick's presentation of the period is peerless, his main character is a liability that drags the film down from masterpiece-level to merely excellent. Most reviewers have attributed this failing to Ryan O'Neal, but astute students of Kubrick's films know better. This director, throughout his career, was simply unable to achieve what Harold Bloom has called the ""Shakespearean difference"", that is, the creation of character. (Name a memorable main character from a Kubrick film that isn't a total caricature.) Redmond Barry (later Barry Lyndon, after his marriage) is an intellectual's IDEA of a Rake: we're TOLD that he's a scoundrel, but Kubrick can't be bothered to put in all that hard work that's required to SHOW us the evidence. He's far more interested in Mood and Theme -- not always such a bad thing in and of itself, but subservience of Character to these other concerns leaches away the impetus for great drama. Even the scenes in which Barry is cheating on his wife are merely snapshots -- and stylized ones at that, in the typically overintellectualized manner of Kubrick -- designed to inform us that, yes, he's a scoundrel. But in any case, Barry ""reforms"" pretty quickly once he's married, so that later accusations of his ""brutality"" seem unfair. Doubtless this is because Kubrick was going for High Tragedy rather than a character study. But the greatest artists manage to combine both efforts.While I've went on about the film's main faults, don't let these distract you from checking out the film. *Barry Lyndon* is very much worth your time. This is Kubrick's most wittily ironic, and most cleverly constructed work. One marvels at the director's repeated and varied use of his chosen motifs: card-playing, horses, lost loves, and most particularly, duels. Duels between man-and-man involving pistol and ten paces; duels between man and social caste; duels between man and state; duels between states. The overriding mood is unending, repetitious struggle. Barry's antagonists are legion in the film: he's always fighting somebody, or struggling against insuperable barriers in order to achieve his goals. The movie also has something to say about tribal warfare and what Jean Renoir called ""the rules of the game"". Barry can play cards, but he doesn't know how to play by the rules of the tribe he wishes to join. Hence his misfortunes in the second half of the movie.Kubrick, under the guise of a romantic period piece, offers us a sterile world in which human beings are denied the capacity for change and growth. The Tribe circles its wagons; tragedy is repetitious. Throughout most of the film, any scene indicating sentiment is immediately trashed by an ironic follow-up. (It's not until late in the film that Kubrick takes things seriously and drops the ironic mask.) All the while, monotonous pieces by Handel and Schubert drone on the soundtrack, underlining the repetitiousness of the entire work. (Handel's ""Saranbande"" is constantly in the background during the final half-hour.) Kubrick even has his narrator ""spoil"" the ending with 40 minutes still to go, because he wants us to marvel at his design rather than be held hostage to the plot (which, given its episodic nature, admittedly isn't much).Finally, Kubrick broke new technical ground with *Barry Lyndon* with the use of camera lenses that, for the first time, could capture indoor light without professional arc lamps and such. The interior shots in the candlelight are just that -- no fancy lighting tricks. Every period-piece owes this film a debt. In fact, most have failed to live up to this movie's example . . . but then, most directors aren't as nuttily obsessed with visual composition as Kubrick was. The final result is a period film that hasn't aged: with the one exception of the then-trendy use of camera zooms (instead of cuts), the film would look as if it were made today instead of in 1975. This is truly one of the most beautiful-looking movies ever made.",7.0,Anonymous,History
A true adventure,"A visual glory of time and movement as we cross settings, nations, villas, wars, and paths along with a man searching for himself in a distinctly modernizing world, all the while holding back to past traditions. Our protagonist is courageous, yet spiteful, frank, yet subtle, a character of his times trapped between borders cut across revolution, languages, and traits. Not only is this one of the most beautifully shot films of all time, the colors, the simplicity of movements, but it is also one of the most entertaining, a true adventure. A masterful director, cast in order. If anything, the a story of a lost person's searching, in order to not only survive, but thrive, is distinctly powerful. A painting in itself, the colors, technique are held in time as if not knowing when it was even possibly shot. A wonderful soundtrack that ensues and inspires.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Beautifully Shot - Needed a Better Lead Performance,"After he finished his Science Fiction masterpiece, 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY in 1967 (the film would be released in 1968), auteur Director Stanley Kubrick turned his attention to a detailed Bio-Pic of Napoléon Bonaparte, spending years researching the period of Napoleon's life and all of it's myriad of details. Unfortunately, he spent so much time researching Europe of that time that another film - WATERLOO - was filmed and rushed to the movie theaters in 1970. This movie, with Rod Steiger in the lead role of Napoleon, bombed at the box office.Consequently, no studio would touch a Napoleon Bonaparte film - not even one that was Directed by Stanley Kubrick.So, Kubrick turned his attention to A CLOCKWORK ORANGE and when that film came out in 1971, Kubrick went back to his deep research of 18th Century Europe and sought a story to that he would fit with that background. He discovered an 1844 novel by Makepeace Thackery entitled THE LUCK OF BARRY LYNDON and Kubrick had his next film.He should have kept looking for a better story.Breathtakingly shot - Kubrick's eye for detail is in full flower with this beautifully shot film - every scene is set up and shot like a Masterpiece painting and this film is STUNNING to look at, so much so that Cinematographer John Alcott, Art Director/Set Director (Ken Adam, Roy Walker, Vernon Dixon) and Costumers (Ulla-Britt Soderlund & Milena Canonero) all won richly deserved Oscars - as did Leonard Rosenman for his haunting score.Kubrick was also nominated for Best Director and Best Screenplay, but (deservedly) did not win these for the Direction and Screenplay are amongst the weakest links in this film for Barry Lyndon (as played by Ryan O'Neal) floats through a series of events that seem to skim the surface (at least until the end) and did not pack much of an emotional punch (again, until the end).While Kubrick wanted Richard Harris in the lead role (and what a different - and probably more interesting - film this would have been if that had happened), Warner Bros. Studios would not bankroll the film unless Kubrick cast one of the top 10 Box Office stars of the day in the lead. That list included Clint Eastwood, Burt Reynolds, Steve McQueen, Paul Newman and Barbra Streisand(!). None of those would suffice. Kubrick had to choose between Robert Redford and Ryan O'Neal. O'Neal was keen to play the role - and since he was the #1 Box Office star at the time (Redford would pass him the next year), it was a ""no-brainer""for Kubrick to cast O'Neal.And that's the biggest issue with this film, O'Neal just isn't a fine - or subtle - enough actor to pull off the role of a vagabond, social climbing rogue in such a way as to have the audience care what happens to the lead character of this film until much, much too late in this 3 hour film.Kubrick spends the first 2 hours of BARRY LYNDON bouncing from vignette to vignette and while there are some interesting moments - and characters - by such worthy performers as Hardy Kruger, Patrick Magee and Leonard Rossiter - it is all too fleeting and O'Neal just cannot be the glue that keeps things together. It is only in the 3rd hour of this film when the action - and Barry - settle down when he marries the Lady Lyndon (Marisa Berenson - who is interesting to watch, but isn't given nearly enough to do) that this film begins to engage the audience emotionally.But by that time, the audience is marveling at the gorgeous pictures on the screen and not caring much at all about what happens to Barry Lyndon.Oh, what might have been.Letter Grade: B-6 stars (out of 10) and you can take that to theBank (ofMarquis)",6.0,Anonymous,History
Kubrick's Best,"Having been a Kubrick fan for almost as long as I can remember being into films, this was a film I had always heard about, but was quite hard to find. Stories of it's gorgeous shots and wonderful characters and dialogue, not to mention it's slow, almost methodical, pacing convinced me that the big screen was the way to watch it. When the chance finally came around, I jumped at the opportunity, and wasn't disappointed.What a film! Barry is at times funny, endearing and cruel, but always interesting. His rise, and subsequent fall, is perhaps the best that the rise and fall narrative has been done in film, the second half of the film eerily mirroring the events of the first. Neal's performance is terrific too, allowing us to draw many of our own conclusions about Barry, while also having enough about him to stand out as his own man. By the time the end of the film comes round, you can't help but feel for the man we've spent the last 3 hours with.The length is also something that has it's importance. Many will see it and be put off, and in the hands of a lesser director it may be noticeable, but Kubrick takes us through this world so brilliantly, with stunning shot after stunning shot, and a story that is both satirical and celebratory. He shows the greed, pomposity and arrogance, while also acknowledging the beauty and elegance. Never before have I wanted to go back in time while watching a film the way I did here. I hardly even noticed the time going by, a testament to Kubrick's pacing, because I just wanted to spend as much time as possible in the fantastic locations, listening to the litany of characters. It is a lived in film, feeling like a world that existed prior to our viewing, and one that will exist long after we have left it.If you ask me, this is Kubrick's masterpiece (and that is stiff competition it is up against). If you can, watch it on the big screen and marvel at the candlelit interiors, vast green landscapes and ostentatious estates. It is honestly like walking through an art museum - the painting like shots can be both intimate and grand at the same time. I've since re-watched it multiple times, and it is just as affecting on a small screen. If you've got three hours, sit and immerse yourself in this world... you won't regret it.",10.0,Anonymous,History
"7.3/10 - Stunning and Often Entertaining, But Lacking in Momentum and Themes","""You are a liar! You are an impostor.""Oh, my. I really, really wanted to love this. It's been quite a while since a movie has truly, utterly blown my socks off, and before picking my next film to watch and review I thought just about that - and if anyone can amaze me again after such a long time, it's probably Kubrick. The Shining and Eyes Wide Shut are two of my favorite films in the entire universe, and everyone I know adore Barry Lyndon. Unfortunately, it seems that I missed something here.Barry Lyndon is a historical drama which takes place in 18th century Europe. It follows Redmond Barry, a young Irish lad and his slow climb up the social ladder, going through his various experiences and encounters throughout the years.First thing's first, the cinematography is absolutely stunning. Almost every single shot is composed so that it looks like a beautiful painting, and I truly feel like the beauty of this film is the only aspect of it which is truly great. It definitely makes things immersive visually, and one can expect no less from Kubrick. I also like the thematic use of the painting-like aesthetic, which is subtle but quite cool when you think about it.The story itself has a lot of good moments, I think - there were scenes that made me laugh out loud (the ribbon scene is so much fun), scenes that built romantic tension in such a tender and beautiful way (the scene with the lady in the moonlight), tear-jerking moments, and yeah, some entertaining fights and duels as well. Problem is, I feel like the story is made from all of these anecdotes, these smaller stories, without having a driving force that keeps you on edge when the plot drags a bit more. It makes the pacing feel quite weird at times, and I'm having a hard time being fully into the story.Moreover, I feel like the themes that Barry Lyndon presents us with - fate and our lack of control over our lives, the search of one after a father figure, the way that status or money and the brutality required to achieve them might make one lose their most human aspects - all of these aren't dealt with in an interesting enough way. Other films of Kubrick I've watched do manage to say interesting stuff without compromising the story and experience, and here I feel like analysis gives me some distant appreciation but doesn't make me fall in love with this film.Which is, again, a shame, and I can already imagine how fellow film nerds will say that I've officially lost it with this review, but what can I do? Maybe one day I'll come back to this film and give it a third chance, but I feel like I can safely say that I gave a proper chance to this movie and took enough time to form an opinion, at least for now.I was really hyped to watch Barry Lyndon but I found myself...well, rather disappointed. The overall experience was pretty good - there were enough memorable, interesting moments, the cinematography is gorgeous and painting-like, and an analysis did give me more appreciation towards certain aspects of this film. Still, it lacks when it comes to keeping a solid pacing and momentum, and I feel like even though Stanley has probably achieved his exact vision, it doesn't touch me as deeply as it has touched others. I'm feeling a 7.3/10 on this one.",7.0,Anonymous,History

"Kubrick Puts Fourth The Regretful Journey Of One Man's Life Majestically, Epically and Dramatically Through Celluloid","Stanley Kubrick for many is considered the finest director to of ever graced the earth. Famous for managing to capture so much detail in one frame of delight, even in the darkest and deadliest moments of his films he retains a naturally deliberate comedic affect. I've always been a great fan of ""Kubrick cinema"" as he's managed to tell devastatingly bleak tales of life and death with such ease and rhythm. Fact is Kubrick knows how you should tell a story through film.Barry Lyndon is a film that has an extensive range on offer to its viewers and with grand visual openness. From the narrative opening showing a fire-armed duel, in a gloomy Irish setting and a long-haul shot of the two men standing across from one-an-other, you automatically know you in for a cinematic treat. The film follows the Irish rouge Barry Lyndon's life; he's not from a wealthy background and strives to become a wealthy British aristocrat during the annoyances of the 18th century Seven Year European War.Barry Lyndon stands out as a true cinematic delight, a masterpiece if you will and a genuine epic classic that has stood the test of time and remains one of the best films ever made. Barry Lyndon came out in the pinnacle of the 70s and managed to receive many awards and praise from critics. I've always adored Barry Lyndon, but it wasn't until a repeat viewing that I finally decided it's my favourite film. Some have called Barry Lyndon ""repetitive"" or as ""flawed beauty"", I see those as foolish opinions because to appreciate the film you have to be able to understand it by looking deeper than what's obvious to the viewer. The film is not remotely ""dull"" or ""repetitive"" because it's a film that grasps you throughout the stretch and pulls you into one man's compelling quest through life.Barry Lyndon has become somewhat of an uncommonly mentioned film that has been forgotten by many and yet remains loved and hailed by others. It's a story that is structured precisely to the minute details and adapted with outstanding delicate appreciation to William Makepeace Thackeray novel.Like most Kubrick films it has subtle humorous undertones and devastating moments of dramatic parallels help make the film have the glorious variety throughout the three hour running time. The story is structured so delicately that there is not a single moment where you're not enthralled or captivated from one of the film's examples of overwhelming excellence. The pacing never falters, nor does it lose any of the originality it holds. There's so much on offer in one frame that you'll want to replay a single still-shot over and over.Kubrick is a perfectionist and he's famous for having that personality trait, his arrogant and compulsive attitudes have managed to bring some of his actors to the verge of breakdown. Werner Herzog is another artistic genius who has some insane traits surrounding his work, but don't they say ""even the greatest artists are a little mad"".The cinematography is some of the most luxurious your eyes will ever have the absolute pleasure of meeting. Even in the most shattering, sorrowful and heart-wrenching moments of the film there's a suppressing beauty withering its way onto the screen. The wonderfully impressive shots of the British countryside setting the scenes for the overwhelming clouds with pouring sunlight squeezing its way through show the comprehensive beauty the world has on offer. The fact the film was shot in natural light, it shown through the wide and ambitious landscape surrounding Barry Lyndon. It shows how there is such a great deal of life surrounding us all and yet we seem blissfully unaware of this.Generally the film's technical aspects cannot be described by anything less than perfect. The mesmerising classical score the film holds helps to create the cold and anti-humanist idea the film is portraying. Another prime feature of Barry Lyndon is that Kubrick found his motivation through some of the 18th century's painters who have obviously helped Kubrick decide what costumes would be able to illustrate the period in time. Easily some of the most impressive and detailed items of clothing ever put on screen, deserving the Oscar for ""Best Costume Design"". The set pieces are also a fantastic part of the film and the realism is stunning. The use of British heritage to set the scenes for some of the housing, the sweeping fields of hills, the winding roads and the ruined half-castles provide the needed pragmatism.Some films that revolve around one character's travels can fail to capture the audience, but Barry Lyndon manages to expertly lead you through the shoes of Mr. Lyndon's life. You'll notice how his character changes as the film progresses, some of his characteristics, habits and usual emotions change. The film studies the arrogance, lying charm and sly individualism surrounding the anti-hero. Ryan O'Neal shows-off his outlandish and shy acting style perfectly with what is one of the untouchable performances of the 70s.The film remains a film buff's dream, a director's ambition and a historian's paradise. My all-time favourite film and one that remains one of the greatest achievements cinema has on offer, I beg you to watch this.",10.0,Anonymous,History
My 5 favorite observations & details about Barry Lyndon,"My 5 favorite observations & details about why the movie Barry Lyndon is so intriguing. (Although most of these are not mine, they helped me appreciate my favorite film.)1) The narrator is unreliable: different because he is not first person like in the novel, but similar by not telling the exact truth.Barry Lyndon is very much in a passionate struggle to shape his life yet the narrator dismisses him as a heartless womanizer doomed (""as fate would have it"") for his unsuitability for polite society- which itself acts accordingly to its own fixed playbook (""fine family fortune!"") In fact, both Lord Bullingdon and his father mock Barry's non-Lord-liness with the metaphor of stepping ""into my shoes"".Also, the women do in fact care about Barry and he does care for them (and of course his numerous father figures)- it is the NARRATOR who lacks heart. The second half is very much about Lady Lyndon grappling with the heartbreak of trying to be happy while in love with this very imperfect Irishman- (namely, regarding his interactions with her first son, other women, and his mother.) So.....The narrator tells us what to think about, but not what to think; so the viewer has to question (& re-question) his judgement as well as the characters'.2) Lots of moments happen offscreen (his father's quarrel about purchasing horses, cousins falsifying the ammunition, Barry mentioning a commander O'Grady, his son sneaking off to the horse stable; there are countless key events described but not witnessed; all of which refocuses the significance of what Kubrick DID intentionally put in front of the camera) Like Richard Schickel said, critics bicker about what Kubrick didn't do; Kubrick lovers enjoy his films in an uncomplicated fashion for what he DID present.Thus the viewer has to actively filter through the narrator's misdirection to appreciate the characters quietly reacting to the impact of missing moments.3) The scene where Barry meets Lady Lyndon at the gambling table is easily encapsulated by two quiet details which communicate so much; 1) Reverend Lunt's eyes as he espies the other two making eye contact, 2) how she is breathing on the terrace. (Note: there is only one substantial line in this whole scene; ""Samuel, I'm going outside for a breath of air."") (It is also poignant to note that Barry's profession is rigging games of chance.)4) No offense to Schubert and Haydn, but Leonard Rosenman's music arrangements are unmistakable; nobody does these tunes like him because remarkably he has seamlessly sewn them to the MEANING of the images and narrative.5) When you consider the theme of three duels by firearms, also include the boxing match and the fencing match; and possibly all three abuses of Lord Bullington; and possibly even the robbery; they are all head-to-head confrontations that shape Barry's fortunes, character, & competence (dramatically!), ...but only the final climactic duel tells us who he has become.This is the key reason I offer these insights: Spielberg is correct in saying every time one repeatedly views a Kubrick film one gets something new; BUT Kubrick himself probably intended a singular perspective: so it is ideal for viewers to appreciate all these enigmas the first (few) times viewing -while being overwhelmed by this flip book of fine art paintings set to classical music.This is NOT a heated epic saga of inner personal thoughts breathlessly rendered by method actors in bravura theatrical performances amid iconic scenes to be parodied on the Simpsons. Most contemporary moviegoers should not dig this film the first time. (Cinema had a specific audience before Star Wars & Jaws.) Self-proclaimed Kubrick fans should NOT expect Clockwork Orange or Strangelove, nor 2001 or The Shining. The stars of this movie are the camera, the era, the universal shortcomings of humans ...and the tacit intrigue of the audience; in other words, the star is purely Kubrick.",10.0,Anonymous,History

He gets robbed by an highwayman when fleeing, enlists almost accidentally into the British army, fights in Europe, deserts once, then gets caught and made to fight with the Prussian army where he also later deserts from. Lyndon falls in with unscrupulous companions and gets involved in cheating at card games all over Europe before he marries into wealth. However even that is not enough for him as in his quest to social climb he destroys himself.It is in some ways one of Kubrick's warmest films helped by cinematography all shot by natural light and candlepower that makes it look like a composition from a painting by Constable, Gainsborough or Reynolds. There is sumptuous art direction the only let down is the almost diffident acting from O'Neal, almost placid to each fortune good or bad the befalls him.Ryan O'Neal was a big Hollywood name back in the 1970s but his career soon fizzled out. A competent actor but never really a big enduring star. Just observe him in 'A Bridge too Far' and his scenes with Robert Redford who has a much shorter cameo and you wonder why the roles were not reversed.Maybe Kubrick wanted O'Neal to be aloof and let the supporting characters such as Hardy Kruger, Patrick Magee, Arthur O'Sullivan and Leonard Rossiter to shine. Yet there are elements of comedy in some of the escapades which O'Neal could had taken advantage off and stamped his acting.Despite the beauty of the visuals this film is overlong at 3 hours. It unfolds at a stately pace and Lyndon slowly reveals himself to be venal who only truly cares about his son. He fritters away his wife's fortune in his quest for acceptance by society until his grown up stepson wreaks revenge and for a moment he shows some humanity in the final duel but it is too late for him.Kubrick took a little known Victorian novel and made it exquisite in its sharpness and less of a chocolate box costume drama. Acidic but still heartfelt.",7.0,Anonymous,History
2001 for the 18th Century,"I have long since admired the work of Stanley Kubrick because he was able to capture the essence of every idea that he took on. In ""2001"" we, the viewer, got the chance to glimpse at the future as if the film where a documentary. In ""Dr. Strangelove"" Mr. Kubrick had us laughing all the way to the end of the world. But what Mr. Kubrick was able to achieve with 1975's ""Barry Lyndon"" is every bit as breathtaking and haunting as ""2001"" or any of his other films for that matter. It's not so much that one watches ""Barry Lyndon"" as the film washes over you, truly making you feel that it is 18th Century England. ""Barry Lyndon"" is not an easy film to watch for those with short attention spans or are unfamiliar with the works Mr. Kubrick because the film is a long, labourous journey. The film, which is 185 minutes long, is about a young man named Redmond Barry (played by a rather stiff but effective Ryan O'Neal) who yearns to crawl out of his poor Irish home and seek fame and fortune aboard. A duel fought over a women with a British officer forces Barry to flee and so his adventure begins. He ends up in both the English and the Prussian armies, fights in the Seven Years War, works as a spy and then marries the lovely Lady Lyndon. But this upwordly-mobile young man is doomed from the start and slowly his plans of grandeur dissolve into an abyss of despair and shame. Mr. Kubrick went to painstaking details in order to recreate the feel of the times (he used real costumes from the period, natural candlelight and actual houses of the age) and he passes with flying colors. This film embodies all that Mr. Kubrick had to say about about human nature and man's destiny (see ""2001"", ""A Clockwork Orange"" and ""Full Metal Jacket""). The former Redmond Barry was doomed from the start to end up at the beginning. Rest in peace, Stanley.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Hate it or love it,"IMDb Top 250: 217Barry Lyndon is a tough film. On one hand, it's beautiful: the countryside is gorgeous, the costumes are amazing, the sets are luscious, and they tried to get as many candlelight shots in as possible. But on the other hand, there's a very plain, straightforward story about an indifferent character with little substance and far too much time. There's a distinct division in taste in this film.The Revolutionary War era is severely underrepresented in film, and with good reason: it's difficult to make an interesting story. When your film opens to a sexual game played between cousins, it's easy to be put off. It's also easy to be put off by the sternness everyone carries. And the white faces. The era is unfriendly to film, but Kubrick made it as digestible and believable as possible.However the story is pure nihilism. Barry starts out likable if boyish, but develops into something else, which like Alex deLarge leads to some mixed emotions. But Barry isn't charismatic, and seems very wooden at times. It's difficult to read him. All of the characters are flawed, but not in an interesting way: Lord Bullingdon (say that name a few times, how can you not hate him) is a snake, lacking honour. Lady Lyndon is a miserable mess who we can never sympathize with, and Ma Barry is not unlike her counterpart in The Manchurian Candidate. No one is consistently likable, so the story is never appealing. Especially since it doesn't go anywhere, or have any meaning. Sure, that's the point, but 3 hours to tell a story that could be summed up in a sentence is ridiculous. I'm all for epic length films, as long as they're engaging: Barry Lyndon is not.Barry Lyndon is a divisive film, so to help you if you decide to watch it, here are my pointers: first, brush up on your history by looking up the Seven Years War. Next, take a picture of a candle and see how it turns out. And lastly, know the moral of the story, that you're not important. With those pointers, you'' have a much more enjoyable time watching the film than I did, because despite its high production values it just couldn't grab me. Not Kubrick's best. 7.5/10",7.0,Anonymous,History
William Makepeace Thackeray turns in his grave!,"Kubrick so utterly fails to capture the spirit of Thackeray's picaresque novel with this vague and tiresome film that it has absolutely no business using the title Barry Lyndon. Thackeray's Barry Lyndon is a brash, swaggering, status-seeking rogue with a dynamic (but seriously faulted) personality, and an indomitable will who  actively schemes, fights, and bullies his way through life. A true existentialist anti-hero.  Kubrick's Barry Lyndon , played by Ryan O'Neal, couldn't be more different, even though he  participates in some of the same activities as the character in the novel does. Kubrick's Lyndon has the demeanor of gentle choirboy: intensely quiet and soft-spoken with a penchant for long, earnest gazes (as is everyone in the film.)  His personality is so completely vague and undefined that next to Thackeray's brilliantly extroverted protagonist, he is practically walking corpse. Thackeray's Lyndon is a man who compels our admiration (even affection) as well our contempt such is the force of his personality. Kubrick turns him into practically a non-entity who even at the end of this three hour film remains a paradoxical and annoying enigma. We learn nothing about what makes him tick because there is nothing there. I really found myself wondering if Kubrick actually read the novel - perhaps he got a synopsis from  a script writer. Did they have Cliff Notes when this movie was made?! The film is steeped in an introspective, meditative atmosphere exemplified by the R. O'Neal character which is totally unsuited to the vigorous, ironic, and humorous tone of the novel. Kubrick has taken the fictional memoirs of a daring, villainous  schemer and gambler and sucked all the energy and life out of them to make a tepid, pensive, piece of aesthetic boredom. The only scene that has any dramatic tension is the duel between Bullingdon and Lyndon which, ironically, is not in the novel. When adapting literature for the cinema doesn't a director have an obligation to the work's author to remain faithful to that author's artistic vision? It's understandable that some concessions must be made when moving between two such different mediums as literature and cinema; but to have such blatant disregard for the essence of the novel from which this film takes its title, Kubrick is guilty of artistic hijacking. It galls me to think that there are probably more persons living now who have seen Kubrick's  bogus version of B.Lyndon than have read the novel; Kubrick, unfortunately, has had the last word because of film's cultural dominance. If a director wants to benefit from the cachet of using the title of a classic novel by an eminent author than he is obliged to remain faithful to that author's vision and not to utterly disregard it as Kubrick has done to such a wretched effect here.",3.0,Anonymous,History
Ambition goes up against Determinism !!!,"'Barry Lyndon' has a connection with '2001: A Space Odyssey'. Just like each character in 2001(who represent their species), Barry is shown to be someone who is willing to do anything to survive and prosper. His instincts generally revolve around his selfish desires of survival. In 2001 the desperate measures to survive at all cost end up being insignificant and inconsequential because of the implied presence of a higher power represented by the monoliths. This presence of a higher power is possibly meant to imply the concept of determinism and subversion of the idea of free will. In 'Barry Lyndon', Barry's father was killed in a duel right at the beginning of the film and Kubrick adds no feeling to that scene whatsoever. Clearly losing his father at a very young age had to have determined the life that Barry was going to lead. Having seen his life get shaped for him at a very young age without him having any influence, everything Barry does subsequently in his life in nothing but to achieve success, wealth and prosperity by asserting his own will instead of having to march to the beat of fate's tune. It is remarkable how similar Barry's sensibilities are to Charles Foster Kane's in 'Citizen Kane'. Kane was another man whose future was decided by someone else at a very young age and everything that Kane did subsequently in his life was to ensure that his life never revolved around anyone else's whims.The constant zoom-outs in the film are deliberate and thematically relevant. In Act 1, we see Barry embark on adventures, visits various places, fights in duels and wars,etc. and does everything else to ensure he looks out for himself and also to ensure he achieves material gains and an elevation in social status which he gets by marrying into wealth and class. He achieves temporary success through the sheer power of his will. This is why I think the zoom-outs in Act 1 are supposed to be premonitory. All of Barry's assertive actions are undermined by Kubrick's camera. Kubrick constantly zooms out to expand the visual field which makes Barry and the other characters look very small in the respective frames. But making Barry look miniscule in the shots, Kubrick is visually driving home the philosophical notion that no matter how hard Barry tries to willfully determine his future, in the end his actions won't matter in the bigger picture. What fate holds for him in the future will materialise whether he likes it or not. This is how Kubrick brings in determinism in the story. In Act 2, the zoom- outs are meant to show the characters completely frozen in time like the classic-era pictures on the walls.There is a scene where Barry views a picture on the wall and decides to buy it. There is a scene that comes up later which is significant because the framing is very similar to the aforementioned scene but the important thing is, this time Barry takes the place of the picture and King George III is checking him out. Barry as a person holds as little a significance as the characters in the painting.Although in Act 1 a number of the shots look like paintings too, but it is in Act 2 that the painting motif gets its thematic poignancy. This is because the majority of Act 2 takes place inside the palace walls and the actual pictures on the wall are constantly in view. The actual pictures on the wall themselves allow Kubrick to draw the comparison between them and his picture-like frame compositions. The purpose of the characters in the pictures on the wall is defined not by them, but by the person who drew them. Similarly the purpose of Barry's life and where it goes and how it crystallizes won't be determined by Barry, but by something/someone else, maybe God, maybe some other higher power, or mere chance(from a nihilistic standpoint) or maybe the society itself that Barry is a part of. Even though, he became Barry Lyndon, a lot of people in his surroundings never saw him as anything other than Barry Redmond. In the end all his achievements went in vain. The masterful thing is that the last time we see Barry in the film, he has his back to the camera. But the significant thing is, instead of zoom-outs, we get a zoom- in. Hence at this moment, instead of expanding the visual field, Kubrick contracts it to convey that Barry's ambition has been put in its place by fate.The cinematography of the film as has been mentioned time and again is jaw-dropping and coupled with the meticulous production design, 'Barry Lyndon' ends up being one of the most authentic, convincing and fully developed recreations of a period setting in the history of motion pictures.Although Kubrick again sets an emotionally distant tone, just like his other films, however the Act 2 of 'Barry Lyndon' contains some of the most emotionally charged scenes, moments and shots of Kubrick's entire career. Losing his father at a very early age, one aspect of Barry's life involved moving from one father figure to another. But when he himself becomes a father, he tries his level best to have the most loving relationship with his son and Kubrick actually upholds the purity of this father-son relationship by treating it with humanism without judgement.I have heard that 'Barry Lyndon' is Martin Scorsese's favourite Kubrick film. I find that interesting because on examination one can find that 'Barry Lyndon' and 'Goodfellas' feature an exceptionally similar arc of 'rags to riches to rags' revolving around two immensely ambitious men with the drive to break the class restrictions and rise to the top with the sheer power of their will and persistence. However, fate in the end reigns supreme and makes all their achievements and adventures seem pointless. Determinism plays a joke on them.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Truly one of the greatest films ever made...a must-see masterpiece,"Stanley Kubrick is widely considered as one of the most talented film directors ever and it can be said that every one of his movies are well worth watching. Barry Lyndon is of course no exception, in fact it's one of his very finest films, at least in my opinion.Everything here is perfection, the music, the acting, the script, and of course the filming and direction. All is simply superb. The film may be long,it may have slow pacing and there may not be that much dialog in it, but none of it hampers the film. Kubrick tells the story mainly through image rather than sound, and said story is so engrossing that the three hours simply whiz by.I don't really know what else I can say beside the fact that it's superb. It's as impressive as ever and really doesn't pale in comparison to more recent features, so really don't hesitate to watch it on the grounds that it may be ""dated"".

A Brilliant Work of Art,"Barry Lyndon, directed by my hero, Stanley Kubrick, is probably one of the greatest movies I've ever seen in my life. Despite Jaws, I don't think there is an other experience I had watching a film than this. Almost ever single frame of this movie can be painting. It's art come to life. I think 2001: A Space Odyssey and Barry Lyndon are Kubrick's masterpieces. I don't understand how this isn't ranked up with Citizen Kane, Goodfellas, or The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly.The Story is about an young Irish man named Redmond Barry living in 18th century Ireland. When he kills an English soldier in a duel, he must leave until the steam blows off. From there, Redmond Barry goes on all sorts of adventures through Europe. Then he meet a rich English lady named Lady Lyndon. They fall in love and marry, and Redmond Barry becomes Barry Lyndon. He soon becomes the emporer of England, but Lady Lyndon's son think he's only marrying her for her money, and tension grows between him and Barry throughout the years that result in a shot off leg.This film basically tells the same story as Citizen Kane. Charles Foster Kane and Redmond Barry both start off as nobodies, and they then become the richest people of their day, and then they realize it's not the answer.This film needs to be seen.

"Get a move on, Stanley!","The rise and fall of a lusty Irish adventurer and social climber determined to sleep his way to the top in 18th Century Europe.Elephantine Stanley Kubrick adaptation of Thackery's novel containing all his characteristic detail and realism and equally characteristic flatness and emotional distance.As usual with Kubrick, every frame is painstakingly composed and lingered over in tribute to its own craftsmanship. Actors, landscapes, props and even the weather are designed to emphasise the words DIRECTOR IN CHARGE. From a cold, technical perspective its all very impressive and polished, with a clinical auteur in evident control throughout. Kubrick doesn't so much tell a story as present a lecture in film craft; no wonder the arthouse critics and film academics love him. But there's about as much life, spontaneity, joy and emotional connection in this film as in a dead lab rat; especially in the last hour when Kubrick's attempts to engineer some audience sympathy with his anti-hero are cringeworthy.The acting? Well it never does get much of a chance with Stanley does it? Ryan O'Neal always was pretty wooden but you can almost feel his boredom as Kubrick puts him through the wringer of take after take, with the drained and laboured results so typical of his later films.  Now here's a director who really would have loved digitally created performers to manipulate like a micro-surgeon.",,Anonymous,History
A strenuous quadrangle,"Kubrick's stately rendition of Thackeray's novel is so timeless that with the rare exception of some particularly 1970s children it could have been beamed through time from the 18th C. Much has been made of the painterly quality of it all so I won't harp on about it here but it really is utterly beautiful. The only detraction for me is Ryan O'Neal's charisma-free performance and he seems for the most part less a dashing rake but more like a bored jock. To hang an entire sprawling narrative on it seems insane. Having said that Barry Lyndon is a remarkable piece of work and largely worthy of it's ""underrated masterwork"" title.",7.0,Anonymous,History
"an excellent, rewarding on multiple viewings kind of masterwork","Stanley Kubrick's Barry Lyndon was a film that upon first experience was a little sluggish, and compared to the bizarre nature of many of his other masterpieces (Clockwork Orange, Dr. Strangelove, the Shining) is lacking. But this was years ago, when I perhaps didn't quite have the patience and attention to underlying emotions the film asks. Upon a few more viewings up until now, I find that this really is a remarkable, deliberately paced film about a man trying to find the cues and the ways into this upper class world.This man, played convincingly by Ryan O'Neil, is like the total con-man in the guise of the perfect gentleman (in a sense, of course less violently and less ambitious, the character has a little in common with Alex from Clockwork Orange). Aside from the characterizations, which do become richer in multiple viewings, the compositions are truly unique, and ask of a viewer more than most can handle.Barry Lyndon is the kind of film that, if nothing else, shows that Kubrick wasn't only this madman director of these satires and totally visual experiences (which he was terrific at), but also could do a tender, expressive, and period-perfect film about a world that most of us know from looking at paintings in museums, which is precisely what Kubrick was going for. Deservedly winning of four academy awards (unfortunately not for Kubrick), it also boasts a fine soundtrack of classic works of music.",10.0,Anonymous,History
The most beautiful motion picture I have ever seen.,"As if viewing a grand hall of the most exquisite portraits, this is the most beautiful motion picture I have ever seen. Stanley Kubrick began his rise to prominence as a still photographer, and that is plain to see; he had the eye for the shot, and uncompromisingly knew how to capture it. A masterpiece, by a true master artist. I don't believe I have bestowed a '10' rating prior to this, but upon this film, I am compelled. If you have not viewed it, I can only insist that you do so when undisturbed, in peace. As Jack Nicholson said, ""Kubrick was the man."" I could in no way disagree with such sentiment. He wrote, produced, and directed this film, and I feel none of his other works, exceptional and superior as they are, compares to it.

I'm sure it's a great novelle...,"... but as a film, 'Barry Lyndon' doesn't quite work. We follow the life of country boy Redmond Barry and his rise and fall in British aristocracy. This is done in such a fragmentaric way it's hard to name it one movie. At one part, Lyndon is a spy for the Prussian Minister of Police, but only for the mere reason to make him meet the Chevalier, and the movie has loads of such bits and parts which are small movies at itself, and hardly interesting or important enough to be concluded in the whole. Another thing I found irritating is the over-use of the voice-over. He just tells way too much. Now, 'film-technical' there's nothing wrong with Barry Lyndon, it's even a masterpiece in some ways (hence the 4 oscars, and the endless and deserved praise it gets for the fantastic usage of lenses to get that candlelight feeling on the big screen), but in the end the story is not interesting enough to catch your interest, at least not for 3 whole hours.

A Piece of Art,"In the Eighteenth Century, in a small village in Ireland, Redmond Barry (Ryan O'Neal) is a young farm boy in love of his cousin Nora Brady (Gay Hamilton). When Nora engages to the British Captain John Quin (Leonard Rossiter), Barry challenges him for a duel of pistols. He wins and escapes to Dublin, but is robbed on the road. Without any other alternative, Barry joins the British Army to fight in the Seven Years War. He deserts and is forced to join the Prussian Army, saving the life of his captain and becoming his protégé and spy of the Irish gambler Chevalier de Balibari (Patrick Magee). He helps Chevalier and becomes his associate until he decides to marry the wealthy Lady Lyndon (Marisa Berenson). They move to England and Barry, in his obsession of nobility, dilapidates her fortune and makes a dangerous and revengeful enemy.Stanley Kubrick is certainly among the ten best directors of the cinema history and it is not necessary to make any comment about his awesome work. ""Barry Lyndon"" is a piece of art, and watching this film, the viewer has the sensation that is seeing pictures at an exhibition. Further, if he or she randomly pauses the DVD on any scene, will have a magnificent painting on the screen of the TV. Therefore, the landscapes, set decoration, art direction, costume design and cinematography are simply spectacular. The music score is one of the most beautiful of the cinema history, with classy and top-notch selection of wonderful classical music. Ryan O'Neal gives his best acting in the best role of his career, and the whole cast is amazing in their intense performances. The long story is engaging, with the narrative in off, in a shameful period of Europe history, telling the rise and fall of an ambitious man initially driven by a lost love.

Brilliant and inspired cinema,"Considered one of Thackeray's best novels ""Barry Lyndon"" comes to light in a brilliant fashion under the direction of Stanley Kubrik with Ryan O'Neal in the title role.A young Irish profligate of the 18th Century finds himself involved in the Seven Year's War in Europe. A born opportunist he deserts as a soldier and by all foul means seeks to improve his status by marrying a countess. He is now one of the new aristocracy...Mr. Barry Lyndon!The film version of Barry Lyndon's adventures as a cheat, as a spy, as a gentleman of the realm is absolutely flawless.  I have only high praise for the uniform quality as we go from scene to scene. The lighting in particular is striking, much like a classical painting. The photography is excellent....sweeping vistas of the European countryside with red-coated soldiers drawn up in battle lines and dropping in disarray under enemy fire....indoor scenes of elegance with people feasting or playing at cards, all bathed in soft candlelightEvery scene is backed by well-chosen music gleaned from the classics. The choice is so good one might think it was written for the film. The art director too can be proud of the meticulous costumes, wigs and make-up; and the aging of the characters is well done and acceptable.There is also a lovely array of characters both old and young with interesting faces like those you would see in an old Rembrandt. As a character I especially like the old count who suffers terribly from an argument with the new Mr. Lyndon.  Another memorable scene is the outburst of the Countess's son who refuses to accept his step-father and endures a thorough thrashing.  There are poignant scenes too when Barry's little son comes to grief....and these are the days too when differences are solved by pistol or sword.All in all a well rounded film.  I find it much more satisfying than ""Russian Ark"" which is praised so highly.  This film is filled with beauty and adventure and proves once again that ""what goes up must come down""....and so we have the rise and fall of Barry Lyndon!",8.0,Anonymous,History
"""A monumental masterpiece by Stanley Kubrick""","The story takes place in 18th Century. A young Irish called Barry falls in love with his cousin and upon disclosing the rival in captain John Quin and his affection towards his beloved woman he resolves to regain her, even if it is indispensable to kill Quin. The instant everything appears to be ended up between him and his cousin, he insults Quin by casting a glass right at his face and demands having a duel with him which he eventually wins. Being positive that he killed his opponent, he leaves his parts so as to evade consequences of his act and discover a better place to start a new life.This is frequently a disregarded effort in Kubrick's carrier which is quite astonishing since Kubrick achieves an utterly ravishing level of cinematic beauty and it remains one of his greatest feats. Whereas any other director could transform the script into an uneven work – a hodgepodge of stronger and weaker scenes, every aspect of Kubrick's masterpiece seems to be polished to an absolute perfection and shows that we are dealing with a great, self-disciplined master. The story is based on the novel by William Makepeace Thackeray. Barry Lyndon which often feels like a relation of the book forasmuch some events occurring on the screen are simply recounted by the narrator. Notwithstanding, it never becomes anyhow discordant or contradictory with the general concept, actually it is difficult to envision the movie without this element which gives it a distant perspective and thus render the flick more historical and epic. It has a great deal of subplots which slightly reminds of Full Metal Jacket. In that film, it does not diminish the excellence of Kubrick's rendition, however, owing to an exploited episodic structure, the ensemble invariably appears to be a little clutter, skipping from one location to another and it is incapable of creating an appropriate atmosphere, particularly in the second half, when a viewer is taken aback by an unexpected transition from a traverse, where a dehumanizing training of soldiers occurs, into a Vietnam chapter. One never recaptures the mood and the second part does not conjure up a suggestive climax of isolation in the jungle which would be adequate. Fortunately, Kubrick is always aware of his aim in Barry Lyndon, he does not delve into digressions that much. In spite of implicating a lot of minor episodes which sometimes slightly reminiscent of the above-mentioned film released 12 years later, the subject does not feel diluted with unnecessary subplots nor is it self-indulgent – the action always revolves around the protagonist. The pace is always right, neither rushed, nor excessively languorous. The story flows steadily. The narrative structure is simple and fortunately not oversophisticated, the linear storytelling makes it all comprehensive and the plot is easy to follow.Whereas one is accompanying Barry becoming a soldier and struggling through the atrocities of war, Kubrick shows an indubitable brilliance in combat scenes which despite being few and far between are ravishingly portentous and electrifying. Successively, while the main hero slowly withdraws from the war and regains the status of a gentleman, a viewer is able to observe Kubrick's apt eye for visuals. Every frame is fascinating, not only owing to the opulence of scenography, but also on account of a sublime cinematography of John Alcott, who utilizes various colours ranging variations of grey, blue and finally warmer colours like red as well as yellow with talent of a prominent painter. The palette of hues is far from lollypop framing of A Clockwork Orange. Exploiting his talent for catching imposing images, Kubrick creates one of the best portrayals of 18th century and through the role of Barry who eventually comes to power, perfectly exposes the situation of those times. Notwithstanding, he never forgets about the major point of the story – the exploration of the power's impact on Barry's character who is more and more becoming a vain male. He disregards love of his wife, he prefers organizing orgies and having affairs to leading a traditional life, hence he becomes someone totally different from what he was at the beginning.Ryan O'Neal is superb as Barry Lyndon. He shows an undisputable creativity with this undoubtedly complex role which gives him a great opportunity to expose his acting skills. He eschews being classified as a righteous persona or a straight-forward villain. He succeeds in being arrogant and charming at the same time. The moment one is likely to cease to sympathise with him, he seemingly becomes an elegant and nice man. Marisa Berenson is quite good as Lady Honoria Lyndon, although she is not remarkable anyhow and rather stays in the background. Marie Kean gives the best performance in the supporting cast as Barry's mother whose possessiveness is revealed near the end. This is something really fascinating and her character's development is atypically delightful. Towards the finale she is rather unlikable and the only matter she cares about is her son's fate.The soundtrack consisting of music composed by John Sebastian Bach, Leonard Rosenman and The Chieftains is a great addition to the ensemble and the movie's classical feeling is even more articulate. The breath-taking cinematography and the ravishing palette of colours, the opulent scenography, the top-notch acting, the tremendous script – they all cooperate with each other excellently.Saying that Barry London is no cinematic achievement is like arguing that sawdust is an exquisite dish. Kubrick did everything to render this a masterpiece and the execution is undeniably remarkable. Long as it is, this is also one of the most beautiful flicks ever created. The magnificence and its monumental nature overwhelms a viewer. The fabulousness of Kubrick's vision is simply eye-popping and jaw-dropping. It is one of the biggest treasures of worldwide cinema and a real tour-de-force that deserves more recognition that it actually received.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Kubrick's best film,"I know that the statement 'Barry Lyndon is Kubrick's best film' is controversial. Really his films can't be weighed against each other, and obviously I speak for myself. Although I STRONGLY believe that statement - I will amend it and say simply that it's my favorite film, and yes, I do hold this film in higher regard than any other. Don't ask me why but there's something about it that makes me come back to it year after year, sometimes multiple times a year.. I think it is a miracle of cinema.It is also a deeply subversive and ironic film that takes your expectations of what a period romance or swashbuckling adventure should be and turns it around, providing you with neither. The opening shots are hazy in the style of a gaudy romance, but this is all quickly undermined when we begin to understand who Barry Lyndon is. He surely is one of the most empty and lazy 'protagonist's ever put to film, so much so that one can hardly call Barry a protagonist as he seems to try so hard to do or succeed at nothing.But somehow we are entranced by his character, and our fascination grows as the lies he tells and ripples he creates throughout the story begin to affect others. He builds a tower around himself which is always threatening to topple. There is a point near the end of the film where you feel Barry staring off, blinking, as though he has just woken up out of his own dream. It's as if he has no idea how he got there.The film is even more moving to watch today - the fact that people still call films 'films' when so much is just video.. Watching Barry Lyndon is watching the cinematographic process at its peak. It has to be one of the most beautiful films ever shot, (and one of the most perfectly lit). It's like a painting come to life. I'm saddened to see the medium of film die out in the way that it is, it makes Barry Lyndon feel all the more like a lost treasure.

I'd seen the doco about Kubrick at which it was so highly praised, recently seen ""Dr Strangelove"" again (and found it much funnier than the first time) and an eponymennial screening of ""2001"" (which made much more sense than the first time).Well, if you liked those, don't be sure you'll like ""Barry Lyndon"". Some of its conventions were just sickly: the candlelight (did they *always* have a little candelabrum on the table just in front of them, and did nobody ever put a candle out?), the postcard-perfect scenes - with very similar rolling hills in Ireland, England, Belgium and Prussia - so well suited to Ryan O'Neill's bland prettiness.The overworked narrator reminded us that this is adapted from a Great Book, and his words hinted that we were missing a story much better told in print.And the pace!  Nearly three hours it lasts. I wasn't expecting an action movie, and it came from a more leisurely time, but we seemed doomed to see many people enter a scene in the distance and proceed slowly, slowly into the foreground, or the reverse.If this represents a revolutionary approach to narrative, count me out. Sorry.Schubert didn't write his Op. 100 trio until about 50 years after the events of the story.(eponymennial: in the year it was named after)",,Anonymous,History
"I used to love it, but now I realize it's mediocre","I used to love the movie, but now, I realize that while it has amazing cinematography, the film itself is boring. It's put together in a brilliant way, but the story is just not compelling. Not to say that there aren't sequences of beauty and brilliance, but I realize now that my love was for the cinematography and craft of Stanley Kubrick not the entertainment value of the film, which just wasn't very watchable. If you wanna see Kubrick at his most artful, well that's Barry Lyndon, but A Clockwork Orange is a close second, and what I really wish is that Kubrick could have put all the brilliance he put into Barry Lyndon into a good film.

With due respect to Stanley Kubrick i won't care about Barry's senseless story ever again..,"BarryLyndon (1975) :
Brief Review -With due respect to Stanley Kubrick i won't care about Barry's senseless story ever again. This is probably Stanley Kubrick's weakest narrative i have seen. The director who is known for free minded and brutal filmmaking choosing this novel and rewriting it in such a senseless manners is unthinkable and unacceptable for me. Barry Lyndon is a fictional tale of a naive boy who wants to become a gentleman. Then he falls in love with the wrong girl (who is after rich men) after rejecting her himself, well are you really reading any sense? Suddenly he wants to fight for her and his fate takes him to other place and other profession. After spending time in army and one time-pass affair with a married woman he goes into gambling business and then marries a wealthy countess to aquire her property. Then he has several affairs with other women and end up losing everything under burden of debts. Okay so am i really supposed to connect with this senseless story and all the senseless characters? I couldn't find a single sensible character in the film. I couldn't find Barry sensible at all to connect myself with his character or any other character in the film. Every non sense things happens so easily in the film and we were asked to believe every foolish conflicts in long 185 mins screenplay. I don't know what made Kubrick to choose this script after delivering 4 Classic films before it when he could have gone for any script from his favoured genre. I don't wonder why this film flopped and had been rejected by audience at the time of it's release. Sometimes even genius people go wrong and this was Kubrick's turn. Overall construction of the film is good enough for eyes to bear. The film won 4 Oscars for technical achievements and that makes film watchable so you can watch it but just don't expect some good cinema or Clasic stuff.RATING - 6/10*By - #samthebestest",6.0,Anonymous,History
Saw Barry Lyndon in 1975 and still love it,"When I was a senior in HS a friend & I saw this movie in 1976--a stretch for me, as I've never been a fan of either Stanley Kubrick or Ryan O'Neal. But this movie blew me away--the story line, cinematography, scenery, narration, costumes, acting, everything was just wonderful. There was a lot of publicity building up to the movie because Kubrick was using Marisa Berenson, a top model with little to no acting experience, who did a terrific job as Lady Lyndon. Ryan O'Neal was also pretty good, his Irish accent wasn't too bad.For some reason, Barry Lyndon was rarely shown on TV & I had to buy the DVD so I could watch it a few times a year. I'm amazed at the number of people who have never even heard of this movie; I recommend it whenever the subject of movies comes up.",10.0,Anonymous,History
"Opulent and engrossing...however, a deep-thinking sensibility muffles its overall impact","Stanley Kubrick received Oscar nominations as director, producer, and adaptation-screenwriter of this well-costumed 18th century drama based upon William Makepeace Thackeray's ""Memoirs of Barry Lyndon, Esq."" (originally titled ""The Luck of Barry Lyndon"" and published under the pseudonym George Savage FitzBoodle). Yet, where Thackeray's story of an Irish upstart who deserts the British army and is eventually caught and recruited into taking up arms for the Prussians was--by all accounts--a rascally adventure, Kubrick approaches the material somberly. The too-careful filmmaker is enormously fond of pastoral landscapes and action seen from a great distance. Kubrick nearly distances himself from viewers as well, though the characters do finally emerge, and the film builds in quiet emotional power. The themes in Act I are much the livelier; encompassing much of the second act, Barry Lyndon's ill-fated marriage to a wealthy, widowed Countess slows things down. Still, the human faults of the protagonist (adequately played by Ryan O'Neal) come to the fore by the film's third hour, and Barry's showdown with his embittered, sniveling stepson is the stuff of high drama. The pacing, overall, is too funereal, and a child's death is endlessly protracted for little purpose, but the fights and brawls and duels are wonderfully staged. ""Barry Lyndon"" runs 183 minutes, however Kubrick is observant and canny enough to keep things simmering, and only occasionally does interest wane. Fine performances help, including Leonard Rossiter as the showboating Captain Quin (who is sadly revealed to have no spine), Patrick Magee as the wily Chevalier de Balibari, and Dominic Savage and Leon Vitali as the child and adult versions of Lord Bullingdon. The film won Oscars for John Alcott's exquisite cinematography and Leonard Rosenman's (somewhat monotonous) music score, as well as for Costume Design and Art Direction. *** from ****",7.0,Anonymous,History
"Gee,...I feel like such an unsophisticated boob!","This is a movie that is often hailed as a masterpiece because of its godlike director, Stanley Kubrick. And I know I'm going to get some serious negative reactions out there, but I really didn't like this movie at all and think it's one of the most overrated films of the 1970s.This is a costume drama that looks very pretty on the surface, but down deep it lacks a soul and any trace of warmth or humanity. Ryan O'Neil is inexplicably chosen to play the title character, though why this American was chosen I have no idea--particularly since, at times, he appeared to be half asleep during the film. This movie is just dreadfully dull and uninteresting.I seriously wonder what would have happened if a lesser-known or obscure director had made this film. I'm sure it wouldn't have received all the kudos and people might have recognized that it was a poor film.After noting all the ""not helpful"" scores given to the other reviewers who panned this movie on IMDb, I guess I'll just sit back and wait for them to start pouring my way!",3.0,Anonymous,History
"Mesmerizing, cinematography at its best","I will not get into reviewing the history of the movie, as there are plenty of analysis on IMDb which are great in doing so.I personally think this is Kubrick's best movie by far, having seen them all, and seen again ( again recently, 2001, the Shining, A Clockwork Orange and Full Metal Jacket ).As another reviewer perfectly said, Barry Lyndon is like a moving 3 hour long Caravaggio display, with a haunting soundtrack and every shot is just perfect.I often enrage at seeing any movie on IMDb rated 10/10 over any pretext and I imagine most of these rating are made by teenagers without enough experience or maturity to make a decent critic about a movie.As a moviegoer myself and son of a real movie frantic, being 43 now, I must have seen about 5 000 to 10 000 movies in my lifetime, of all genres and all countries. For 20 years now I have sticked to having only four 10/10 movies that immediately come to my mind : Barry Lyndon, Amadeus, Lawrence of Arabia and Elephant Man.

The finest period film ever made,"Barry Lyndon is a big-screen version of the Thackaray novel which describes the rise and fall of Redmond Barry, a common but fiesty Irishman who (through luck as much as skill) ascends the ranks of British nobility.It's a great pity that this is one of the lesser-seem works of Stanley Kubrick, for this is a highly believable and entertaining recreation of 18th century Europe with none of the stuffiness that many movies and TV shows set in this era substitute for atmosphere.Like Full Metal Jacket, Barry Lyndon is a film of two halves but it hangs together much better, perhaps due to the deliberate intermission and cue cards. The first part of the film covers Barry's early years in Ireland and his career in the army, before a chance meeting offers him the opportunity to move on in life. The scenes in the first part of the film are always entertaining, and often stunningly beautiful. Of particular note is a scene where Barry meets a German woman on his way through Europe - the combination of the incredible low-light photography and outstanding use of music make this scene one of the most touching I have ever scene, even if the behaviour of the characters is something we can understand but not necessarily condone.Once the intermission has passed, we know that Barry has indeed meet a suitable and very wealthy aristocrat whom he marries. But the warmth and passion we would expect in these scenes after seeing the first part of the movie are non-existent, indicating that not all is well.From hilariously camp army officers to the 'bravery' of Leonard Rossiter's army officer, this film is pure entertainment that is very difficult to better.",10.0,Anonymous,History
The Kubrick movie that made me a fan,"I was introduced to the work of Stanley Kubrick at a college screening of 2001, a film I appreciated but did not love. Years later, a chance viewing of BARRY LYNDON on TCM, motivated by my interest in the 18th century, reintroduced me to Kubrick and got me totally obsessed with the man's films. I have seen all Kubrick's movies and out of all his features, I only love A CLOCKWORK ORANGE more than BARRY LYNDON, which, on an objective level, might be his most perfect movie.That BARRY LYNDON is gorgeous, no one will contest, not even the film's fiercest detractors. However, for me, the film's story, with its sense of irony and dark humor, make it a classic. And despite the claims that Kubrick movies are all cold, there are a few moments that really hit you in the gut. I even confess that one scene in particular made me weep and continues to make me weep every time I revisit this masterpiece.",10.0,Anonymous,History
A Really Beautiful Film,"Some people say that this is Kubrick's unsuccessful film, but as a huge Kubrick fan, I say this is his most beautiful film. I have watched all Kubrick's but I love Barry Lyndon the most.The ScenesThe scenes are wonderfully made, it's like looking at moving 18th century paintings. I can feel the atmosphere in every scenes, as if I were there. Sure there are some errors in the scenes (the Frenchmen reload too quickly in Barry's first battle) but it doesn't ruin the whole point and simply tolerable. The scenes are also filled with beautiful soundtrack.The PlotThe story is based on a book and it feels so deep. It's not about hero saving the world or about an unstoppable villain, it's about a young man, confused, struggling for his survival in every misfortunes, and how his fate has shaped him into a different person. A realistic story of how hardships and struggles can turn a common man into an opportunist. The main character is so human, unlike many other stories where the main character is a person of infinite bravery and chivalry.The EmotionThe staring, the kissing, all done beautifully and with purposes. I can feel the emotion in the staring, kissing, and conversations. The emotional details play important part, different with many film nowadays where kissing and sex scenes are useless and have no relation with the plot at all.ConclusionBeautiful piece of cinema art. Good film even in nowadays standard. Many modern viewers don't like it because it's long, no CGI, no shallow humour, no patriotic theme, no doctrine, no senseless fighting and waste of human life. But those are not the main elements of a film. A film is good as long as it is entertaining and tells interesting story.",10.0,Anonymous,History

The writing and acting seems stale at many points during the film resulting in a film which is quite a chore to review even given the luscious scenery that the cinematography gives us. If you care about the visual qualities of immersion that movie making can give you, then watch this film. If you are interested in period pieces of the 18th century, watch this film.

"""I'll duel him, if I have to follow him into the church""","Barry Lyndon, if not one of Kubrick's most underrated pictures, is certainly his most unjustly overlooked by many of his fans. At first glance a period drama culled from a work of 19th century literature may seem completely at odds with the innovative and in-your-face look of Space Odyssey and Clockwork Orange, but it is perhaps the most carefully considered work by a director at the top of his game.Apparently the source novel is one of its authors less well known works, but its structure and themes were perfectly suited to Kubrick. Kubrick's films can usually be seen as being made up of contrasting segments, and Barry Lyndon is in fact formally separated into Parts One and Two. Part one is the rise of Barry, Part two is his downfall. The two parts can be seen as mirror images of each other, and there is a sense of history repeating itself, particularly with the two main pistol duels. Barry's story begins with his duel with Captain Quinn. It ends with his duel with Lord Bullingdon. Both duels are between a young man and an old man. Both duels are (essentially) over a woman, and in both cases the younger man is a relative of that woman who has a somewhat inappropriate love for her, whereas the older man is or will be her legitimate husband.Kubrick further contrasts the two halves of the story. Part one is largely set outdoors, and all the most important scenes take place in the open air, signifying Barry is at first an outsider. This is in contrast to the luxurious interiors of Part two. The music changes throughout the picture from delicate folk airs, to pompous military marches to stately classical pieces. Kubrick goes to some pretty excessive lengths to add little subtle touches that signify the changes in Barry's position. For example, if you watch carefully in the first half, you'll notice that every time there is a candle-lit scene, the number of candles on the table increases by one each time.Of course, all these symbolic touches don't really add much to the story. What is the real key to Barry Lyndon's brilliance (and also the reason it isn't more popular) is its pacing. It is incredibly, indescribably slow. There is no abbreviation. Every little event, every encounter is played out at in full as it might really have happened. Establishing shots are held for so long that they almost become miniature scenes in themselves, and act to set up chapters in the story rather than the next scene. This is not simply a life story stripped down to the exciting bits, it really feels like a life story. Two things prevent the film from becoming mind-numbingly boring. Firstly, every shot is beautifully composed and lit, so if nothing else the film is nice to look at. Secondly is the way Kubrick handles the emotions.Emotion is nearly always understated in Kubrick's films. His characters tend to hide their emotions, and Kubrick rarely uses any cheap devices to make things too obvious. The emotions in Barry Lyndon are at their most understated. All the dialogue and conduct is highly formal and ritualised, in keeping with the period setting. But paradoxically the emotions are also constantly on display. Throughout these unbelievably long drawn out set pieces the characters are constantly betraying their innermost thoughts and feelings through subtle gestures, body language, tones of voice and facial expressions. Kubrick actually makes more use of close-ups than in any of his previous pictures, far subtler than what is generally called a reaction shot, but the characters are constantly reacting all the same. The world of Barry Lyndon is one in which the characters say one thing, yet think and feel another. When eventually we do get to see a very openly emotional scene – little Brian between his mother and father – the effect is incredibly powerful, like the floodgates have finally been opened.With all this considered the actors all do an amazing job, and the casting is perfect. Marisa Berenson is particularly good, keeping her face blank and expressionless, but showing very strong emotion just beneath the surface. There is a great supporting cast too, for example Leonard Rossiter as Captain Quinn, who helps keep that slightly bizarre and silly feel that is in all Kubrick's pictures. This is not to mention Michael Horden's narration, which gives a spot-on tone of friendliness with a touch of sadness.Barry Lyndon is really a refreshing take on the period drama. All too often period films and historical epics simply duplicate the stuffy, formal manner of their source material. Barry Lyndon on the other hand transcends its literary roots and, while sticking to the language and story of the novel, shows a very genuine humanity in the characters. It never forgets that, no matter how much they are constrained by the conventions of the time and place, people still experience the same emotions. It's not the most entertaining of all Kubrick's films, but it is an amazing achievement nevertheless.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Amadeus without F. Murray Abraham,"Try to picture it. Try to picture the movie Amadeus without F. Murray Abraham (Salieri). Magnificent sets, powerful music, impeccable costumes, great directing... but no character. That's the feeling I got from Barry Lyndon.As another reviewer put it, this movie is ""3 hrs of pretty pictures and wooden characters - not one involving personality."" Well, maybe that's a bit harsh, but overall I agree that not one of the characters was sufficiently engaging. Just after the halfway mark (after hearing the same 8 bars from Handel's ""Sarabande"" played for the 7324512th time) I was about ready to pull the plug.But I'm glad I stuck around til the end. Like I said, the grandeur of production was enough to make it worthwhile, and the plot picked up in the last 30 mins. My rating swung back from a 4/10 to a 6/10.I just wish the characters had souls. Even the reviewers who rated this a 10/10 hardly mention the acting; they focus on the technical and visual merits instead (which I agree are 1st class... though perhaps lost on some of us non-film-school folks).But someone's gotta say it: People born in California should NEVER be allowed to do Irish, Scottish or British accents. I say this about Ryan O'Neil as well as Keanu Reeves and Julia Roberts. Well OK, Julia wasn't born in California, but her accent in Mary Reilly was awful just the same. And yeah, I know Keanu was born in Lebanon, but he'll always be a surfer dude to me.Bottom line: if you're a fan of Kubrick or Thackaray, you'll probably enjoy this. But since no one on Earth has ever finished a full Thackaray novel (admit it, you just bought the Cliff's Notes in high school like the rest of us), I think we can narrow this down to Kubrick fans only.",6.0,Anonymous,History
excellent,"although i love kubrick i was expecting a boring and stupid movie here, i mean, ryan o'neill as the principal character sounded to me a little bit disgusting, it was 3 hours long and having seen most of kubricks movies before i couldn't think of a movie that topped for example ""the shining"", well, i was partly right, because this movie didn't topped ""the shining"", but i was amazed that this one was a close second or third. i just loved the movie.ryan o'neill is amazing and his character is very complex. the others were also excellent, specially the russian general (or whatever he was). costumes were very accurate and the editing was flawless. but, without a doubt the best of the movie are the backgrounds, they look like a painting and i had to watch them several times to be satisfied. the picture was just magical and beautiful. stanley did an excellent job indeed. you won't be dissapointed if you watch this.special mention to the battle scene where barry helps his friend, the scene was very shocking and the soldiers marching like that looked as a very powerful scene. 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,History
A movie seen as a painting,"This film is to be seen as a painting of the eighteenth century. The characters are merely models in an art gallery. During three long hours they limit themselves to pose while most of the narrative moves off camera, evolving through the words of the narrator. And where is the genius of it all? To see it just think about the story and reflect on how it invites to be told. It's almost a story of musketeers that 90% of directors would have accelerated, florid and embellished with sword duels romantic scenes, grand statements (love, hatred, revenge ...) and boatloads of emotion. Kubrick went for a completely different path. If you want to see the story it has to be on his terms - as a still life that hardly communicates anything that yourself have to create the thrill of fitting in the frame that you have in front of eyes.

Restrained historical drama with incredible period detail.,"A roguish young Irishman goes on a tour of Europe and - various military adventures down the line - falls in to a marriage of financial convenience.Three hours of screen time is long by anybody's standards, but at least you are viewing the incredible vision of Stanley Kubrick for that time. Whatever you might say about him, there are moments in all his films (even Clockwork Orange, which I detest) that are magical and moving.Here there is not a scene, prop or location that doesn't ring true to the period; although maybe a bit over-the-top picture postcard at times.Many indoor scenes seem designed to make the world almost in to a moving painting, in fact there are times when we linger (for a few seconds) in stillness before dialogue/action starts to further the effect.Some say Ryan O'Neil was too modern for the central role, but I disagree, his acting is far from Oscar material but it gets us through the movie with minimal fuss. While BL is clearly not a man of honour, a lot of the time he is merely doing what he needs to do to get by and I found him hard to dislike - even through he is a child beater!Often he is given no real lines, but emotes on the tragedy and his traps with looks, anxious glances and glazed expressions. Female lead Marissa Berenson (although hardly in the picture on the old stopwatch) seems chosen for her dazzling profile - which we linger on slowly and lovingly, by order of films joint producer and director. We don't know her or understand her though - and that is the film's one major fault.BL is the kind of film that you are going to have to get yourself prepared for mentally and in terms of sitting comfort. There are real moments of mastery here (the duelling scenes - with the rules being explained slowly and clearly - are the work of someone who understands tension and timing perfectly), but while I salute it for its technical expertise and loving care, it does leave you with the feeling that you have spent three hours in an art gallery as opposed to watching a film.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Barry Lyndon - Review,"Ahhhh didn't like this that much, but I tried. I tried to pay full attention because it's a Kubrick movie and I easily consider him a genius, but I couldn't. It has beautiful cinematography, gorgeous music, and solid direction, but the story just isn't compelling enough and the main character isn't interesting enough. It's a decent character for sure, but not as much as I wanted. Just wasn't able to get on board with this, it's surely a juicy and fun look into the 18th-century folk. It's still fascinating how differently Kubrick filmed his movies - that camera zooms, which are all over the whole movie, are mesmerizing. I'm quite happy that I already watched it because it's a classic, but it didn't stick the landing for me. So it's the worst movie of Kubrick for me, but hey, out of 6, and every another is just pure cinema, so if my worst movie would be like this? Haha, it's all right. Extremely looking forward to Paths of Glory, heard a lot of great things about that. And it's funny to watch this and Thor 4 in one day.",6.0,Anonymous,History
Another Kubrick Masterpiece,"Barry Lyndon is one of the most captivating single-man journeys I've ever endorsed. The coinciding messages about the effect poverty or wealth can have upon an individual's character, ambitions, and actions are marvelously exhibited. The film's finale is as exhilarating as it is inventive, and proves itself as one of Kubrick's finest cinematic sequences. The narration the movie offers however, feels glaringly unecessary, but despite that, every other aspect of Barry Lyndon is all you could ever hope for in a Kubrick gem.

Kubrick's beautiful museum tour bore.,"Stanley Kubrick offers up end to end JMW Turner landscapes along with some eye popping portraiture of 18th century styled Marisa Berenson in this stunningly photographed visual masterpiece lensed by John Alcott. But given its lengthy running time featuring a dreadfully miscast Ryan O'Neal as the title character it amounts to little more than a museum tour; and even The Louvre gets tiresome after three hours.Youthful Redmond Brady falls for his cousin Nora, getting himself into a duel with an English Army Captain and killing him causing him to flee Ireland, be waylaid by highwaymen, join the army, desert, sleep with the farmer's wife, join the Prussian Army, hook up with an Irish card sharp and marry into title and property the massive success he had hoped to become before a swift downturn in fortune.In the hands of a capable actor of the day, Barry Lyndon may well have ranked as one of Kubrick's better films but O'Neal simply rings hollow from end to end going from an overgrown chubby cheeked young adult to a dissipated, aging old man with the healthy glow of Malibu Ryan still in evidence. His lilt is a timid wisp and Kubrick's incessant close-ups of his lifeless look of hurt an indignation after awhile can no longer be assuaged by Stanley taking us on frequent trips to the country.Michael Hordern lends the imagery and the dignity it demands with his narration while chamber orchestras bang out Vivaldi, Bach and Schubert among others to present us with one gracious tableau after the next but with O'Neal as the linchpin to this picaresque journey across the magnificent countryside of Ireland and GB the picture staggers more than gallops.Kubrick himself bears blame with a running time that includes four duels, the first offering one of the film's more expedient moments while two others run inexorably overlong. His mesmerizing candle lit interior shots at times seem like they will run the length the stick or at least until the band takes a break.Barry Lyndon may be the prettiest girl at the dance by far but it lacks the energy of Tom Jones (1962) before it, along with Albert Finney and a magnificent supporting cast carrying it along at break neck speed. It also had an outstanding look but more importantly a heart and vitality that Lyndon lacks barring it from the pantheon status that its look commands.",6.0,Anonymous,History
Classic costume epic may be Kubrick's masterpeice,"Kubrick at his very best, in a ponderous film about a less than heroic main character, Lyndon, who lets no human values get in the way of his quest for power and wealth.  The film doesn't let us simply dismiss the often unpleasant (to say the least) Barry, however, forcing us to sympathize with his dreams and the sadly human means he uses to find his personal immortality through the acquisition of titled nobility for himself and his progeny.  Kubrick almost lets his glorious picture of the period overpower the characters, but it is plausible that this was his goal.  A very adult period peice that blows away all Hollywood epics before and since, and pointed the way for James Ivory's superior efforts along the same lines.",10.0,Anonymous,History
The rise and fall of an opportunist,"""Barry Lyndon"" is Stanley Kubrick's film about a fictitious Irishman, Redmond Barry, who lived during the reign of King George III. This film manages to impeccably capture a sense of period with wide shots of lavish and colorful sets, scenes and greenery as well as impressive works of art and architecture. The film also includes an effective combination of classical pieces and marching music that comprise the score.This film's story is developed with a slow-pace intended to make the film more thoughtful than entertaining. This is reinforced by the inclusion of a narrative and the division of the story into two parts. Sometimes narratives are unnecessary for a film or even a hindrance, but in this case the thoughtful and clever prose was beneficial to the film. The first part of the story chronicles some scenes from Barry's early life and his military career. The military displays and battle scenes proved captivating even though the battles were brief and highlighted the inept tactics used in the Seven Years' War.The second part shows the troubled married life of Redmond and his interactions with the English nobility. Personally I found the first part to be the more interesting of the two, but ultimately both parts told an interesting story. Both parts show duels, whether with pistols or swords, that are engaging without being embellished.Ryan O'Neal leads the cast as Redmond Barry. O'Neal's acting regimen largely consists of speaking in low tones, casting lingering gazes and occasional bursts of emotion. None the less, he creates an interesting character that is despicable in many ways but sympathetic in others. The film also has excellent supporting performances. Marisa Berenson gives a fine performance as Barry's careworn wife, Lady Lyndon. Leon Vitali is also excellent as Lord Bullingdon, a bitter son from Lady Lyndon's prior marriage. The animosity between Barry and Bullingdon is well-developed and striking. Frank Middlemass was effective at showing palpable and perceptive disdain for Barry as Sir Charles Lyndon. I also enjoyed Leonard Rossiter's performance as the proud man of airs, Captain John Quin. Overall ""Barry Lyndon"" is interesting as a slowly paced but well-developed period film.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Unbelievably beautiful cinematic experience,"Barry Lyndon is considered a middling success, in terms of how well it was received when it was initially released (critically and by the public), how well it stacks against other Stanley Kubrick movies and how well it did at the box office.For me it is a glorious, 3+ hour sensory treat. The Sundance channel played it Easter morning and ran only two commercial breaks.Stanley Kubrick excels at creating stunning, unforgettable visuals. Some of the most famous are Slim Pickens riding a nuclear warhead, James Mason casually painting Sue Lyon's toenails (Lolita), the astronaut dismantling HAL, floating over a circuit pad and making the computer progressively dumber and dumber, until it starts singing ""Daisy,"" Alec and his droogs in ""A Clockwork Orange"", and the sergeant berating a recruit in ""Full Metal Jacket."" So what is the stunning, unforgettable visual in Barry Lyndon? Practically the whole movie! Mr. Kubrick set out to create a cinematic experience out of the Gainsborough paintings of the 18th century. Several scenes in Barry Lyndon are filmed in candlelight, which creates an ethereal experience.Was there any woman as beautiful in any movie as Marisa Berenson was as Lady Lyndon in Barry Lyndon? Granted, she had help from Stanley Kubrick's direction, but could any actress of today have embodied this role as well? Doubtful. Ryan O'Neal excelled in the title role, as well.Winner of four well-deserved Oscars for set design, cinematography, musical score and costumes. See it!",10.0,Anonymous,History

Ryan O' Neil stars as the titular character who is an opportunist who fools a high-class woman into marriage thus attaining a position in that society. The pacing is slow- as is the case with every Kubrick film but it keeps you invested. The direction is crisp, and some scenes are so good they look like paintings from the renaissance period. The scenes involving candlelight should bring about goosebumps. This is a period drama you should watch.",,Anonymous,History
Must-see: yes; as good as they put it: maybe no.,"Well, Barry Lyndon was made in 1975, and I remember reading somewhere that is the first movie made using a steadicam, I can't recall it exactly to be honest (make your search on this, please) so it's a good starting point for the already famous movie.The photography, of course, maybe you have heard a lot of it, and YES, is just amazingly beautiful, most of the scenes are made without artificial lightning (according to the legend; I wasn't there), and they made custom lens with an aperture of (f/0.7), the highest as far as we know for this movie.Why I'm only talking about the technical aspects? well, it's because the screenplay is awful, maybe you have read some people saying that is a dull movie, if you are not interested in cinema or painting probably it will be. I couldn't believe it when it started, the first scenes are so bad... I thought that it was bad acting, but soon I realized that was the script, there are some really stupid lines, I don't use this kind of words often but it's just that: stupid. It gets a little better as is advancing, is not the worst thing neither, but yes is dull.Now, the last thing. This is the second time I watch the movie and I had it in a 8 point qualification; it's down to 6 now.Watch the movie; after all, it stills a Kubrick and Kubrick was great.",6.0,Anonymous,History
Old School Delight From Kubs,"Old Kubs is at it again. A man with the most insane set designs I have ever seen, he goes to 11 with his period drama BARRY LYNDON. With a wonderful performance by Ryan O'Neal (although it might have been a bad idea to have him play the younger Barry), a wonderfully paced screenplay, and cinematography that rivals the great T Malick, he rifles us with an epic story of fortune gained and fortune lost. This film contains some extremely poignant moments, perfectly orchestrated and brought to life by O'Neal. At over 3 hours, however, BARRY LYNDON does test your patience. Towards the end, its hard not to get frustrated with Kubs. Still, the climax of the movie is some of the most intense stuff I have ever seen (and I have seen a lot). I mean, the guy is on point, and I think this is perhaps his best work. We miss you, Stanely, and I'm always willing to forgive you for EYES WIDE SHUT. Tedder.",7.0,Anonymous,History
"When you think of 'Kubrick', you should think of 'Lyndon'.","When thinking of the directing legend Stanley Kubrick, some of the films that may spring to mind could be his sci-fi '2001: A Space Odyssey'; maybe his ground breaking and controversial 'A Clockwork Orange' or maybe even his wonderful turn at horror in 'The Shining'. One film that perhaps won't immediately hit you is this one; 'Barry Lyndon' and this is a great shame.The one thing Barry Lyndon has going for it all the way through is the feeling of luck/chance. The film is impossible to predict and this instantly makes it good as it grabs you and draws you into its world. It also does this with its wonderful collection of 'mise-en-scene' on display. The costumes are out of this world, the continually mole-faced characters are delightful as they are juxtaposed for their time and the settings are as consistently different and refreshing as each other.When I was watching this film, it felt like some sort of gritty crime drama set a few hundred years ago. Lyndon's climb up the aristocracy's hierarchy sneaks up on you a little bit as you realise that he's got to make something of his life given the position he's now facing. All this is kicked off following a nicely done and particularly moving love story early on. The brutish, overly confident British soldier/captain has spoiled Lyndon's love interest and everything is set up superbly for the actual incident to happen. Once the journey starts, you can't tell which way it's going. While totally engrossing and maintaining that luck/chance feeling throughout the first hour, 'Lyndon' sucks you in and doesn't exhale for a moment. Everything that happens is an experience and keeps you interested as to what the outcome might be.What also struck me about the film is that at times, you have no idea what the characters are even saying. From memory, the characters interact in German and some form of 'Prussian' and the gyp is: there are no subtitles (!) However, this isn't a bad thing in fact it adds to the experience. It would be spoiled if some tacky looking 1970's style font popped up telling what it is everyone is saying. It gives you the feel that you're actually there with them and it's great.Unfortunately, no film is without its flaws be it length or otherwise and the film suffers from this. During 'part 2' of the film, and especially during his married life; the film falters. The character settle down and it feels like he's reached the end of his journey until something pretty unpredictable and shocking kick starts it again, but this is quite a while later. There isn't much energy in the film, the narration dries up and the settings stays the same. In fact, it's rather dull at this point.But, as I've mentioned, something kick starts it again and it's back on the road of unpredictability and anguish.Definitely one of the most under-rated films of the 1970's and shouldn't be forgotten when thinking of Kubrick's best films.",7.0,Anonymous,History
"Long with no real impact, beautiful locations","I'm not sure how this got 8.1 on the reviews, but I found it a waste of three hours.

Possibly the best period movie ever,"This movie remains underrated from most of movie-watchers and Kubrick fans. It's a shame because it as all the ingredients for a 10.

Great cinematography(candle light scenes are outstanding), great acting, superb costume design. You won't be jumping off your seats every 10 minutes but it is at least as good as any of Kubrick's movies - perfect. I love the slow rhythm and the carefully thought dialogues as it really helps for the credibility of the whole experience. A must see for everyone who loves art.",10.0,Anonymous,History
the finest period piece I've ever seen.,"I often find myself avoiding period films. This is normally due to the stilted acting, or the movie being entirely historically inaccurate. ""Vanity Fair"" is a good example of this. It is by the same author as Barry Lyndon, but is completely off the mark. It is obvious that you are watching modern actors trying to act like they aren't modern. (Invariably by using a British accent, even if it's a civil war film.) I will admit that big reason why this movie is different is because I have a weakness for Kubrick films. The austere and symbolic aspects of his films, the breathtaking cinematography and framing as well as the understated acting that he requires; these aspects all really appeal to me. This movie is no exception.Another Kubrick aspect to this film is his relentless pursuit of his inner vision. He had to practically invent a camera lens (based on prototypes built by NASA) to achieve his entirely candlelit scenes. He studied period paintings for months in order to work out his storyboards. He used authentic antique costumes. He would play Classical music from the time in order to improve his actors' mood.The overall effect of this effort is that the movie draws you into its setting, making you truly feel like you are living in the time of the characters. I don't think I've ever seen a movie that REALLY did that. This is one of the best of the genre, and one of my favorite movies of all time.",10.0,Anonymous,History
"beautiful, magnificent and triumphant.","""Barry Lyndon"" is one of those movies that reminds us why Stanley Kubrick's what it is, let's start at the weak point of the film, the script is well encaixadinho but contains some holes off the pace at times are lost, though their actions are well defined, and the actions that do not excite although not bad, but the picture of this film is undoubtedly one of the best of Kubrick and consequently the film, scenes recorded without artificial lighting are of a beauty and reality are south reais, the costumes and screen elements are also incredible, rich in detail and takes us directly to the time, perfect, along with all the scene compositions that are really a work of art, zoom them in and out that Kubrick uses all the time is to show us the scene of perfection, this is quite typical in his films, but this is phenomenal, if you pause the movie at any time, you can capture the screen and send frame and put on the wall of your home the aesthetic beauty along with the details and compositions of all scenes are something I can not put into words, the soundtrack does not stand out much, but when it appears is fundamental and guides the tone of the film, ""Barry Lyndon"" is beautiful , magnificent and triumphant in their technical questions that show all that famous obsession with Kubrick for detail, the three-hour film are a bit unnecessary, the script extends beyond what is proposed, but it is good to have more time to admire the beauty of the movie.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Fantastic and Enthralling,"Barry Lyndon is a masterpiece of modern cinema. The plot, acting, directing is fantastic all on top form, one of Kubrick's most underrated film in my opinion.

Kubrick's mild letdown sandwiched in between two greats,"Following a troika of masterpieces (""Dr. Stranglove"", ""2001"" and ""A Clockwork Orange""), Stanley Kubrick decided to make a period piece. In ""Barry Lyndon"", the title character (Ryan O'Neal) abandons all morals with the goal of becoming rich and titled in 18th century England. Of course, he's only doing himself in.It's debatable whether or not Kubrick was the ideal person for a costume drama, although he did a pretty good job here. Unfortunately, Ryan O'Neal isn't quite right to play Lyndon. Still, one can look for similarities to Kubrick's other movies. For example, the first Mr. Lyndon is in a wheelchair (just like Dr. Strangelove and the one character in ""A Clockwork Orange""). There's a bathroom scene, like in ""The Shining"" and ""Full Metal Jacket"". Throughout most of the movie, Barry and Lady Lyndon (Marisa Berenson) are wearing red, but not at their wedding (that's a filmic element meaning that they aren't marrying for love). But overall, this isn't the Kubrick movie that I would recommend above all others.",7.0,Anonymous,History

"Well done, but for what?","Barry Lyndon is a three hour Rembrandt, one it seems Kubrick made every effort to make as purposefully boring as possible. Its supposed to direct your attention to the shots rather than the plot, to the utter perfection exuded in its cinematography and composition rather than any overarching meaning. It is thus impossible to deny these aspects of the film. Barry Lyndon is truly stunning.Its just so self indulgent. The plot feels like watching paint dry, but if Kubrick intended this to be a high art piece I suppose thats the point. You're literally watching three hours of paint. The narrator makes it obvious that this is supposed to be a boring film. I get so unspeakably tired of it for a stretch, but then a shot is both so gorgeous and subtly funny that it sucks me back in for a little. Kubrick has succeeded in making a film you can lose yourself in; I just would never want to be lost there for long.I just cannot get over the fact that NASA gifted Stanley Kubrick a state of the art camera, and he decides to make a period epic with it. Barry Lyndon is successful in its visual brilliance and sharp satire of British royalty, and is at times a somewhat compelling tragedy. It is, however, inescapably boring and falls short of the unadulterated brilliance I've witnessed in his other works.6/10: Flawed but entertaining.",6.0,Anonymous,History
Very Fine Filmmaking!,"Now there are some people out there who may call this film, Barry Lyndon very dull and pretentious. But I found this film to be quite gripping and masterful in telling the story. This is cinematic art, and art at it's finest. There are going to be no blazing action scenes or no potty humor, but this is a film that take it's own sweet time to tell the story.Stanley Kubrick's film is based off a book from William Shakespeare and it tells the story about the rise and fall of an Irish rogue as a member of the British aristocracy. We see how this man, Redmond Barry goes from a soldier in the British's army to a man who marries a fancy widow.The acting is very good. But outside of Ryan O'Neal, there are really no famous faces here. I think that is good because with a famous cast, that may distract from the story. Some even go as far to say that Kubrick is the best ""actor"" of the film. That being said, his directorial techniques are very active in the film and this film is a directorial success for the legend.Overall, Barry Lyndon is a vast epic that requires your complete attention. It does a good job in drawing your attention in. This is a film I would call as ""lost art,"" because nowadays, we do not get to see films like these. This film features excellent technical skills and the cinematography will capture your breath. This is an epic that ranks as one of Kubrick's best films, along with 2001: A Space Odyssey.

"Stunning, Mesmerizing and Not Without Some Good Laughs.","Barry Lyndon is as great a film as so many say it is. It truly does transport one to another place and time with a sense of authenticity. I too was completely taken in with Barry's story and the eloquent way in which Kubrick presented it and allowed it to unfold. It's remarkable how time slips by unnoticeably while watching this film despite its 3 hour length and deliberate slow pace. What also struck me about it which I've not seen others comment on is the sense of humor that this film evokes about many of Barry's fortunes and ironic twists that it takes. I feel it evident in everything from the opening and ending statements displayed on the screen to the dry droll of the narrators voice along side some pretty comical situations Barry finds himself in. The dueling scenes, the style in which battles were fought, the narrator explaining how Barry's lonely German Frau took many passing lovers into her cabin during the course of the war as he rides off into the misty morning after their romantic liaison. The base human desires, not so noble emotions and flaws that arise in the characters often bring a wry smile to the proceedings. This sense is especially strong in the first half, after the intermission when things become quite dire for Barry I felt less of this comical undercurrent or only in a much darker shade. Whether one senses an undercurrent humor to all of this or not, it is a stunning memorable film and easily one of the top 100 of all time.",10.0,Anonymous,History

No other director has ever been able to trap me so completely within the film's world than Kubrick has with Barry Lyndon. Every movement and every word is so carefully thought out, and the set designs, costumes and make-up arranged with such skill that it's hard to find any technical flaw throughout the movie.It's a shame Barry Lyndon was and is as underrated as it is.

Barry Lyndon is about an outsider who marries into aristocrat and fakes his life.

The Pomposity of Greatness,"Some people find Barry Lyndon a unique, as a result of being remote, effort in a sort of transcendental film-making. Others find it a pretentious flat tire. I shake my head at the latter view. How can anyone be bored by such a daringly resolute film, unless they've become such sleepy filmgoers that no movie can make an imprint on them unless it complies to their expectations? Stanley Kubrick's three-hour adaptation of William Makepeace Thackeray's picaresque tale, which succeeds transcendently as a film which experimented with film stock, lenses and natural lighting, may not be a great entertainment in the traditional sense, but it's a reckless augmentation of directorial clarity: Kubrick saying he's going to make this text work as a model of the way he sees the world. The chamber music saturating the soundtrack is so delicate and sophisticated yet so primitive, as is the setting and time.This four-time Oscar-winning period film is substantially hostile in its deliberate coldness. Many of its turns take place offscreen, the cleverly opinionated narrator tending to tell us what's about to happen and we learn long before the film ends that its hero will die broke and unfruitful. This disclosure doesn't much dishearten us, because Kubrick has directed Ryan O'Neal in the title role as if he were an oil painting. He would be a dauntless man of power were he not seeing tunnel vision.And the film has the pomposity of greatness. Aside from how much it cost, how many years it was in the making, not being the commercial success Warner Bros. had been hoping for. How many directors would have Stanley Kubrick's self-assurance in taking this body of history and drama, this basically small yarn of a young man's rise and fall, and completing it in an approach that ultimately bids our approach to it? We not only see Kubrick's movie, we see it in the mindset on which he demands.His title character is a young man to whom things occur. Barry appears to take hardly any knowing charge over his life. He falls into a short-sighted adolescent love, quickly has to leave the community after a duel, enrolls just about inattentively in the British Army, fights in Europe, defects from not one but both sides, falls in with significant and shady compadres, marries a woman of affluence and charm and then devastates his own world because he misses the morale to endure in it. And all of these things feel capricious. Young Lord Bullingdon, Lady Lyndon's son by Sir Charles, despises Barry from the start. The marriage is not a happy one, yet they celebrate a new son. Barry enjoys himself and philanders whilst keeping Lady Lyndon in apathetic isolation.The key is that the Baroness's son is another Redmond Barry. We're reminded of the righteous renegade young Barry. And we see through the depictions of the world around him that conquering was the inclination to acquire love. He was conquered as a young Irishman, as the rejected third of a love triangle, thus his likewise response was to conquer one's rivals, which heightens the intensity of the Baroness's pain and desperation when she is subjugated by him after being of such dominant distinction. In the end, who's conquered who?",10.0,Anonymous,History

Like Stepping Into a Classical Painting,"I'm reading Thackeray's ""Vanity Fair"" even as I write this comment, and what strikes me about ""Barry Lyndon"" now that I've read something by the author who wrote it is how much the film recreates the experience of reading Thackeray. ""Vanity Fair"" is nearly 700 pages of nothing much happening, yet it's all fascinating. That's ""Barry Lyndon.""Ryan O'Neal plays the eponymous protagonist, and Marisa Berenson his beleaguered wife in this costume drama that follows the exploits of our dear rogue Lyndon from young manhood to weary middle age. And that's really it for lead characters. Neither O'Neal nor Berenson registers much, but no matter. The true stars here are the film's magnificent and jaw-dropping production design, followed closely by its score, which, like in other Kubrick films, incorporates previously existing classical compositions that are perfectly matched with the material. Every shot in this film looks like a painting, which was Kubrick's intention and why he used such a square aspect ratio. The meticulous details of 18th Century court life make this movie endlessly fascinating, even if many viewers have complained that it's emotionally distant (a criticism that could apply to more than one Kubrick film).I loved ""Barry Lyndon"" the first time I watched it, thought it was hollow and lacking the second time I watched it, and then went back to thinking it a masterpiece the third time I watched it.

This slow-paced tale is brought to life by beautiful images and painting-like scenarios, supported by one of my favorite music themes of all time. Watching this movie is almost like stepping back in time, experiencing every detail of this epic story together with the characters. The plot of the story is intriguing and full of amazing events that keeps you floating through the entire 3 hour trip.Even though Ryan O'Neal is not the most respected actor through history, and many have written that he delivers a poor performance, I think he makes a remarkable performance, and gives a mysterious shade of life to the main character. He is quite dull in many scenes, but nonetheless he captures this strange dreamlike feeling which on one side drives you nuts and on the other side gently drags you into this imaginary world.The wonderful achievement Kubrick makes is to set up the scenery as if it was a painting, giving it a beautiful surrealistic touch to reality so to say, mixed with the great choice of music and lighting, this simply pays of as this master worked pearl of film-making.Generally this movie is a masterpiece from start to finish, with top notch set up, lighting, filming, music, narrator, acting and story.

A Scoundrel's Tale,"You have to hand it to Stanley Kubrick. The man has range. All of his movies are acclaimed classics, many of them are regarded among the best in their respective genres and they cover a truly astonishing range of different subject matters. With this movie that being a period costume drama.Barry Lyndon is at its heart a picaresque story, which is a Spanish novel type where the story follows a young man, often coming from a lower social class, trying to improve his lot in life, often mixing with the high class aristocrats. The style is often satirical, even comedic, despite the grim happenings and bleak tone. And that's essentially this film in a nutshell, though I certainly hope that in the original novels, the main characters are more likable.Yet, while I do not like Barry Lyndon (Ryan O'Neal) as a human being, the whole film is still very watchable. The set pieces are stunning - with Kubrick trying to mimic the paintings of the era and largely succeeding - the costuming is great and while the plot is very slow and deliberate, it's still endlessly intriguing. The events are also refreshingly diverse, with Barry experiencing very different kinds of adventures throughout his life.Is it Kubrick's best work? I don't think so. The technical aspects are once again groundbreaking, the depth of detail is astonishing and the sheer mastery of his craft is evident in every frame. But, the story just isn't as unique as in his other films.

Truly stunning ....,"Barry Lyndon, which I recently saw for the first time in nearly twenty years, remains one of the most extraordinary films I have ever seen.I clearly remember seeing the film on it release and being quite literally overwhelmed.No other film distills Kubrick's visual and directorial style so completely as Barry Lyndon.Much of the film's brilliance lies in the stunning cinematography, which is not only a technical tour-de-force but also captures some of the most beautiful images ever created for film.And few films have so successfully combined music and image, even though the soundtrack is in mono. (It proves all the modern multichannel wizardry is of no use if thought behind a film's sound scheme is lacking).The much discussed central performance by Ryan O'Neal is in fact almost flawless. O'Neal's Lyndon remains a cypher and in some ways distant from the viewer but irresistible at the same time, buffeted by fate and the consequences of his own failings.Indeed all the performances, from Sir Micheal Hordern, who narrates the film and the rest of the cast are excellent.Whilst the story is episodic and the plot straightforward it serves as the essential backdrop for both Thackeray and Kubrick's biting wit.It also contains some of the most trenchant anti-war sentiment you are likely to hear.This is a great film.",9.0,Anonymous,History

In fact, this 18th century story seems to reflect a problem very present in our 21st century society. To quote Notorious B.I.G. who says ''Mo' money, Mo' problem. It seems this movie reflects this train of thought very well. Furthermore, this picture gives a great general idea of the aristocrat hierarchy during the Age of enlightenment. Grosso Modo, this movie is well acted, well directed and representative of the historical dynamic of the 18th century. This film is recommended to those of you who love the historical details in movies.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Boring!,"This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. The only reason I gave this movie a ""2"" instead of a ""1"" is due to the costuming. The entire movie seems to be nothing more than wealthy aristocrats sitting around around starring at each other. It is true that there is a little vindictive action in the movie but I could never understand how anyone could have written something so boring.I paid good money for this in a theater when it was released. I would have had a more enjoyable time simply walking around a mall or an outdoor trail.",2.0,Anonymous,History
A gem of a film,"It took me a while to find this film. Having seen most of Kubrick's work, this was one of the last films I have to watch from him. It is one of the best movies I have ever seen in my life in terms of being a complete film. This has great dialogue, story and of course the picture is masterful. I now watch it every year around fall, along with Jeremiah Johnson. It's a must watch for any film student, and worthy of a purchase.I don't usually watch period pieces, but this is one of the rare films that I really enjoyed (along with the count of Monte Cristo). I hope to watch it in theaters one day.",9.0,Anonymous,History
My favorite movie of the 70s,"I guess this is one of Kubrick's most underrated movies. Every frame is like a painting. Just like in A CLOCKWORK ORANGE and EYES WIDE SHUT Kubrick uses the expressions of characters (like the accountant cunningly looking at Barry and his wife as they write cheque after cheque slowly leading to ruin) to convey what is really going on in a scene. He uses dolly out shots quite frequently in this movie, as if slowly revealing parts of a painting. There is dolly out where a young Lord Bullingdown is gazing at a magic show - pensive and uninterested, but when the camera moves backwards and more characters are revealed we see Barry Lyndon, his wife and his mother all looking happy and laughing at the magician.Kubrick also uses these exceptional and easily distinguishable actors (like Leonard Rossiter who plays Captain Quin, Patrick Magee as Chevalier de Balibari and Marie Kean as Barry's mother) to create tremendous impact. Actors in Kubrick movies are often used as special effects. The way Rossiter marches in as Captain Quin and the way he dances with Barry's cousin and lover create an immediate impact on the viewer. Patrick Magee is tremendous. He just has to be in the frame for example the way he stands at Barry's wedding, it is amazing. His caked up face conveys cunning as well as tenderness. And Mary Kean smiling grotesquely in the scene with the magician is also pretty unforgettable. Kubrick often uses these wonderful an grotesque actors to create small but memorable and unforgettable characters - like the sinister waiter in THE SHINING inspiring Nicholson to commit great unspeakable of violence, the Russian costume shop owner in EYES WIDE SHUT, the cruel warden and the crippled writer in A CLOCKWORK ORANGE etc.And a few words about the duel between Barry and his stepson Lord Bullingdown - that scene was better than any Mexican standoff in a Sergio Leone movie. Tt was a slow burn, Kubrick raises the tension gradually without using any musical score, almost as if a ceremony is being conducted. Kubrick shot this great scene in 1975. And created a similar scene of almost equal or greater impact in EYES WIDE SHUT,nearly 25 years later when tom cruise's character is found out at the orgy and is questioned by the master of ceremonies in front of all the attendees.The outdoor scenes are beautiful, conveying the idleness of life in the 18th century. The indoor scenes convey the richness of life (for the aristocrats), with the paintings in the background and servants to assist even for the smallest activity like shaving.Ryan o Neal plays Barry Lyndon with a dourness that sort of predicts the eventual decline and fall of the character. And like i mentioned earlier, the supporting cast is stellar. I thought some parts of the movie like the sword fight scene and the one where Barry beats up his stepson were hilarious. Watching this movie is a pleasure. It is like having a huge sandwich or cake with many hidden layers. Or drinking fine wine (10/10)",10.0,Anonymous,History
Superb exploration of the Human Condition,"This is not simply a ""costume drama"", it is an allegory-at  once darkly comic and profoundly moving- about the human condition. Barry Lyndon is an everyman attempting  to make his way in  the world, who is ultimately undone by his own pride, vanity, and folly. In the films supreme final irony, the very act which spiritually redeems him leads to  his final worldly defeat. He has the chance to finally destroy Lord Bullingdon, but he will not violate the gentleman's code.Bullingdon, however, has no such compunctions. This film is utterly magnificent. All of the minor characters are as vivid as the minor characters in Dickens. The lighting, the music, and the stately pace of the film , are perfect. The Film contains scenes which rank with the greatest in cinematic history: the robbery, the battles, the death of Barry's child, and, then, finally, the terrific duel, one of the most thrilling ever put on the screen. Those who called this film ""boring"" should hand in their memberships in the Screen critics guild-or get seeing eye Dogs.",10.0,Anonymous,History
One of the best movies I've ever seen,"One of my favorite movie director is Stanley Kubrick. I used to compare him to Scorcese and Tarantino. But after watching Barry Lyndon, I have to say that Kubrick is the best of them all.It's hard to believe but I'd like if Barry Lyndon were longer the its 185min. Thackeray novel is too good to be shown in ""just"" 3 hours. But Kubrick did the best that could be done.If there where only the second half of the movie - the decline of Lyndon's life - it would be already a great movie. But there's also the first part of the movie. Beginning with the duel with a England army captain till marrying with Lady Lyndon when he still lived in Ireland, Redmond goes to the Seven Years War, fighting with England, sees his uncle die in batte field, running away from the England army, been captured by Prussian Army ,working as a spy and finally working as a gambler.Technically, the movie is perfect and uses a special NASA-made lens for the inside scenes illuminated only by candle-lights.",,Anonymous,History
Lesser known Kubrick but worth seeing,"Everybody knows about The Shining, A Clockwork Orange, and Full Metal Jacket - even if they haven't actually seen the movies. But I've never heard ANYONE talk about Barry Lyndon. I found out about the existence of the movie by browsing Kubrick's filmography on IMDB.It's not that Barry Lyndon is bad. It's a spectacle that could as well be the most well known film of a director. But Kubrick's other films are even more famous, so they overshadow how good this one is too.I like how Kubrick made different type of films and always tried to make a masterpiece of that specific style. Barry Lyndon is a historical epic that has visual appeal, interesting characters, and a story of a long and winding journey. It's easy to see that the film is based on a book, even though I haven't read it. It has a very literary style. By that I mean the overall pacing and length of the story, and also the dialogue has poetic tendencies. If you like long books that follow the adventures of the main character throughout different places and times, you'll probably love this film.It's a little bit lengthy movie for my tastes but that's all right for this kind of film. I had a long and boring evening to spend with nothing else in mind so the movie had a fair chance to win my respect and it kind of did. I'm not going to watch it again very soon but it left some kind of lasting impression. I'll probably watch it again at some point and then possibly rate even higher.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Barry Lyndon (10/10) Classic!,"Barry Lyndon by Stanley Kubrick is an ultimate classic for me. It shares so many attributes with Kubricks more renowned work 'A Clockwork Orange'. The script is fabulous and sophisticated yet very rarely harsh. Each scene is beautiful, as though it could be a painting or a postcard. The film is filled with great scenery, artwork and excellent music (as is Clockwork Orange). The film features some magnificent castles, houses, decoration all of which looks genuine. It shows the scenery of the British Isles like no film before. This shows Kubricks talent as an artist.Although the story never gets really 'deep' the film still captivates an audience because of it's bizarre layout. The film layout seems very retro to me, in the way the film is structured around the narrators input. As with 'Clockwork Orange' the use of language, accents and local talk leaves a big impact. The layout reminds me of the way the great Tolkien story's - very exact, to the point and no beating around the bush. The film takes the audience through the incredible life of a young Irish man named Redmond Barry, through his days of glory, to great happiness right through to utter madness.The film is long winded, but by no means is this a bad thing. This length allows the audience to get an incredible insight into more-or-less every character. The acting is very basic and the script seems very down to earth to me. This is why I loved the film. You can watch the film and really get a feel for what this era in Britain was like.All respect to Kubrick for this one. Magal.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Believe the hype! Hype well deserved. Hollywood take notes!,"I was born after this film was made, and I am absolutely blown away with the impact that the cinematography of this film delivers. People who are saying this is boring would never be invited to the salons and spas that are so accurately portrayed in the film.Literally every scene could be freeze framed into a timeless visual masterpiece. The impression that it projects could NEVER be achieved with digital technology and should not ever be attempted to.As far as the story goes, Barry is an opportunist and a soft spoken predator/ conqueror/ exploiter. The contrast of physical beauty and raw ugliness of the human tendency provide a contrast that is just mesmerizing. This was recommended to me by a history teacher and he described it perfectly as an accurate representation of the era. Believe the hype.",10.0,Anonymous,History
"Interesting, but Long","Barry Lyndon is a GOOD film.  However it is also an extremely long film, but a very interesting one.  It is my least favorite Stanley Kubrick film, which is saying a lot about the man's career.  This is the only Kubrick film I would not consider a GREAT film, but only a GOOD one.  How many times do you come across a filmmaker who's movies are so good that the worst you could say about your least favorite one of his movies is that it is ""GOOD?""I definitely would have cut a few scenes if I had directed it, but I would recommend it for anyone who is interested in European history.One word of advice: the movie is broken up into two parts and divided by an intermission.  I suggest you watch the first part one day and the second part the next day.  That's what I did and I think I enjoyed it more because of it.Second word of advice: my mother bought me the Stanley Kubrick Collection on DVD for my birthday.  I had not seen the movie before my mom bought the DVD for me.  I was not very impressed with the DVD.  It doesn't have any special features except French, widescreen, and a rather lame trailer and the quality wasn't up to par with the other DVDs in the collection.  Until they make a better DVD, I suggest renting a widescreen VHS copy.  Its cheaper that way.",6.0,Anonymous,History
BBC TV Makes Better Period Pieces Than This,"I revisited ""Barry Lyndon"" after 25 years and found 3 hrs of pretty pictures and wooden characters - not one involving personality. 25 years ago I probably thought this was ""art"" - now it's boring crap , it's safe to say, since the wretched auteur theory was debunked.

Pure ART.,"Barry Lyndon is a prime example of Kubrick stepping back from standard Kubrick and making something that baffles audiences. Much like Eyes Wide Shut , which opened in the nineties and was met with disappointment, this film, which was released in the 70s, often deviates from the director's standard directorial signatures.There is a loud and frequently remarkable score to go along with many of the scenes (and it really is a great score) and the running time, at just over three hours, is enough for someone to realize who is calling the shots in the editing room, but it feels more like a Spielbergian period piece than a Stanley Kubrick movie.It feels like an adventure, with our lead character constantly going through changes and frequently finding himself in new situations that call for different settings and when those settings change, we know we're in for another half-hour or so of fun (and sometimes intense) action.I loved it.",9.0,Anonymous,History
"Barry Lyndon - ""A Cinematic Vision of Life""","It can easily be said that in order to be fully appreciated, the films of Stanley Kubrick require a second viewing or at the very least one which is undertaken with the fullest of dedication. Both Barry Lyndon and 2001 fit into this category - both masterpieces of cinematography and of sound, they both seem to divert very easily from the pathway of other typical notions of cinema. Unlike Kubrick's other works both these films depart from any sense of dialogue and although narrative is highlighted in Barry Lyndon through the presence of a narrator, there is none the less a far more powerful underlying narrative technique present. One of the few films ever to accomplish such an art is Barry Lyndon, in which the narrative is conveyed through the pure emotion, melancholy and silence of the film's protagonists. Redmond Barry's character rarely speaks within the film and his actions are undoubtedly more powerful than his words. Rather than face heated argument or debate he instead reverts to man's violent tendencies - this is clearly seen when he throws a wine glass in Captain Quin's face; the presence of duels and fighting throughout the film, which soon develops into that of a very powerful motif, which is furthermore enhanced when he is seen whipping his stepson, Lord Bullingham. Kubrick has shown through this multi-faceted masterpiece a fresh form of cinema and a power of silence. By reverting from the typical artistic tendency of pathetic fallacy, (indeed it is hardly ever seen to be raining or cloudy within the film) Kubrick instead uses silence to display such a sense of raw emotion. It is very crucial to notice that Barry and Lady Lyndon's characters almost never speak to one another throughout the film, which adds a layer of sadness and depression to the film's narrative, whilst Barry's simple words of ""I'm sorry"" speak volumes of their relationship, one which is marked by pain, sorrow, betrayal and greed. Kubrick has produced a film of epic proportion, and whilst the battle montages are easily rivalled by other period pieces, it is Kubrick's power to shoot the development of Barry Lyndon's protagonist throughout his life that remains the film's quintessential element. The film is adorned with a period score and other resonating pieces of classical and baroque period music, which compliment both the so-close to perfection cinematography, and in the same vain as Kubrick uses sound in 2001, the exclusion of dialogue within the film.Barry Lyndon is a film often overlooked within the Kubrick filmography due to its serious and slow-paced undertones. It is these undertones, however that help to build up the film into a work of art that inspires possibly only the most devoted of film enthusiasts. This film should be viewed as many have suggested as such, an artistic portrayal of a period long romanticised, yet scarcely interpreted with such loyalty and devotion to the screen. Whilst Barry Lyndon remains among the greatest works of modern cinema, it is one, whose viewing must only be conquered by the most passionate of film-goers, if it is ever to be truly appreciated. It accomplishes that which few films are capable of, in bringing pure life onto the screen. Perhaps only rivalled by the select few other masterpieces of cinema, Kubrick's Barry Lyndon is a life epic, which leaves the viewer shaken and inspired. It is a film with the power to leave the viewer standing upon a whole new perspective of life, one which told through the neutral story of Redmond Barry provokes pure sorrow and depression within the heart of the viewer.In short it could be said that Barry Lyndon is one film which embodies the real values of cinema, the ability to portray precisely the notion of life on the screen and that which so strongly affects and resonates within the mind of the viewer. It is a film that will leave even the strongest of viewers humbled and depressively shaken. It is film of outstanding expertise and experience, both in artistic nature and in narrative. Barry Lyndon is a modern masterpiece and should be viewed as such, a cinematic vision of life. If one were to simply define it as ""cinematic perfection"", in doing so one would be doing it an injustice.Harrison Cohen - harrisoncohen@msn.com",9.0,Anonymous,History
A Once In A Lifetime Experience! A Dazzling Beauty Of Epic Proportion!,"Of all the classics that Stanley Kubrick had crafted throughout his filmmaking career, Barry Lyndon was the one I was least interested to check out. Period dramas aren't my thing for I find this genre of cinema far too preoccupied with its lush set pieces, period-specific make- up & antique costumes than the main story at hand and while this cinema does checkmark all those elements, there is something about it that sets it apart.From the moment its Warner Bros. logo appears on the screen, being accompanied by the famous classical composition, Sarabande, by Handel, Barry Lyndon had my curiosity. What eventually left me absolutely flabbergasted was just how extraordinarily beautiful its images were, from the first frame to the last. It's the most authentic looking period piece in cinema history and the way Kubrick has brought it to life is an unprecedented achievement in itself.A fictional account set in 18th century England, the story of Barry Lyndon is narrated in two parts and covers the adventures of its titular character. The first part follows an Irish named Redmond Barry and covers the journey & the means by which he acquired the title of Barry Lyndon. The second part covers the fall that followed after his rags to riches arc in the first half as we see Barry becoming increasingly obsessive with nobility which ultimately results in his tragic downfall.Written, produced & directed by Stanley Kubrick, Barry Lyndon features all the trademarks of the legendary auteur and presents him setting a new bar for photography in filmmaking. Shot mainly on location, the film effectively captures the timeline its story is set in, thanks to the in-depth research of 18th century period, its magnificently detailed set pieces as well as its immaculate costume design. Also, Kubrick's insistence to use natural light to capture majority of its sequences is one aspect that never fails to impress.Cinematography is undoubtedly the most impressive & influential aspect of Barry Lyndon. A jaw-dropping achievement that has innovation written all over it, the camera is static for the most part and makes efficient use of close-ups, steady zoom-in or zoom-outs. Relying only on natural light to film its drama, the camera employs specific lenses that allow it to capture sharp images in even low-light conditions, as evident in its night sequences which uses just a few candles as the only light source for the whole set. And it looks truly unique.The radiant glow of the night segments is highly reminiscent of its period and also matches the colour composition of various paintings depicting the night settings of that era. Images of daylight are no slouch either as in every scene, the background looks like a huge canvas of a gorgeous painting, and the sheer beauty of it is so breathtaking that one can pause any given moment and that frame is pretty much destined to look beautiful on any wall. Kubrick also makes another aspect work flawlessly for the classical compositions compliment the narrative amazingly well.Editing isn't much of an issue for the story remains compelling to an extent throughout its demanding runtime. The pacing is slow and takes us through many snippets of Barry's life, but some of it could've been left out. Those 187 minutes are frightening from afar but if you fall under the spell of its beauty, then it becomes a far smoother ride. The cast comprises of Ryan O'Neal, Marisa Berenson, Patrick Magee & Hardy Krüger with O'Neal impressing the most. His character arc is wonderfully written, undergoes a full circle and O'Neal does his given role a complete justice while being finely supported by the rest.On an overall scale, Stanley Kubrick's Barry Lyndon is the closest cinema has ever come to emulate the elegance & aesthetic quality of a popular painting on the film canvas. Yet, this isn't a film that everyone is going to love even if they end up admiring the heck out of it. Its overlong story, inaccessible characters & relaxed pace is what might veer some viewers off the course. Nevertheless, Barry Lyndon is a cinema that needs to be looked at & marvelled upon the same way people observe the brushstrokes on a beautiful portrait. An aesthetic, artistic & influential classic in every way that's in a league of its own, Barry Lyndon is period filmmaking at its most dazzling. Don't miss it.",,Anonymous,History
"Not Kubrick's Best, Though A Great Film Just the Same","""Barry Lyndon"" is the tale of a young man who comes into power by a stroke of fate. Ryan O'Neal does a fine job in this role, which is bittersweet, knowing that he has such potential but will forever be overshadowed by his girlfriend, Farrah Fawcett.I have nothing really of consequence to say here. I can marvel at the technical skill it took to film by candlelight and whatnot, but others have spent plenty of time on this. In short, the film is a masterpiece, as all of Kubrick's films are. I don't think it's his best work, and it's certainly not my favorite, but as I said, even his least is better than many other directors' best. So, regardless of where you rank this in his career, it's a winner.",7.0,Anonymous,History
A history lesson with Kubrick.,"No doubt for those of us that like to indulge in a little history lesson every now and then, it is hard to find a movie that so perfectly captures the realistic portrayal of people in earlier parts of the past millennium. Here, the great Stanley Kubrick has captured and frozen a part of time that will last forever. Taken from a European novel, the story is that of a young Irish rogue who takes it upon himself to rise up in the social class and make a life for himself. How he goes about this is quite unique and interesting, as well as the way Kubrick invites us the audience to partake in this journey.Nearly every scene is so perfectly lit, designed and dressed, it simply sweeps you up in the times of eighteenth century England. The dialog is outstanding, including the narration. The costumes and sets are immaculate and nearly steal away from the drama itself. Most of all, Kubrick has given us a look into the past and what it meant then to be someone and all the hard work it took to matter. Certainly not for everybody, with a running time of three hours and a very slow pace, Barry Lyndon will polarize some people. For Kubrick fans as well as history fans, however, it will amaze, dazzle and uplift as one of the very finest works of a great director and a great period in human history.",10.0,Anonymous,History
The main character deserved worse,"I have to give credit to Stanley Kubrick for being the only director to never make the same film twice. If one were to watch all of his movies, one would never know they were made by the same man. This is incredibly hard to do and very few filmmakers have undertaken that risk. Even fewer filmmakers have undertaken that risk and were successful at it. Kubrick was both and that might be one reason why he is loved by so many film lovers all over the world. Although I can give him credit for that, I also feel his films are deeply flawed and some are quite boring.'Barry Lyndon' is a lot like many other Kubrick films. It is directed in stunning fashion, with several brilliant sequences throughout. It is beautiful to look at and the costumes great. At the same time, the film fails in creating a character the audience can like watching for over three hours. I doubt many film lovers can possibly like the main character of this film. He is a user and an opportunist; he has almost no sympathy for the people he has hurt and used throughout his lifetime. Something bad happens to him at the end of this story. Although it is bad, I felt that he deserved much worse than what he got. He hurt and abandoned too many people in his life to receive something that was the equivalent of a slap on the wrist.",6.0,Anonymous,History
Amazingly Beautiful,"Barry Lyndon is quite the film. I had heard this was Kubricks most slow film, and while it did feel slow in certain areas, most of the time it had me enthralled. It's a beautiful and epic film, and because of it's length (3 hours and 5 minutes), you really get the feeling you have seen this mans life.I think I will start off with just the visuals of this movie. Wow. The costume and set design in this are absolutely incredible. It's also shot incredibly well. It's no surprise why it won Oscars in those categories. The whole time I watched it, I kept thinking that it didn't feel like a movie. I never imagined the cameras and crew standing there. It felt like I was witnessing people in this time period. Like I was actually there. That's the highest compliment you can give a period piece film. Every shot is beautifully framed and looks like a painting, which was actually what they aimed to do. Visually, it will just blow you away.The story is pretty great to. It spans over a large amount of time, and lots of different things happen. There are little sections where it felt like, to me, that nothing new was happening and that made the film drag a bit, but those sections were fairly short lived. The performances overall are pretty great. Ryan O'Neal sometimes left me a little underwhelmed, but he had his moments, and I thought that he did a good job when he really needed to perform. All the other side characters are great too. Everyone just seems to fit their roles.Barry Lyndon is a film that needs to be seen if you are a fan of films.

A total stinkeroo,"Where to start with this pile of crap? How about the obscene length of it? By half way through I was just willing somebody, anybody, to blow Ryan O'Neal's head off and put an end to this ordeal.This film could have been so different. Just imagine if Michael Caine had been cast in the main role, he would have created some humour and sympathy for a basically disgusting, cowardly and hateful character. But no, Ryan O'Neal runs the gamut of the emotions from A to B. He has the charisma of an ""I speak your weight"" machine, and I just could not wait for him to get what he deserved.I give this a 2, it would have been 1 but there are some good shots of the scenery (which does a better acting job than the principals).",2.0,Anonymous,History
The life of an Irish scoundrel,"""Barry Lyndon"" is a coming-of-age story with the Kubrick touch, so nothing you've ever seen before. It is the story of an Irish boy whose life takes him to roads he'd never think he'd get in, nor does the viewer. Instead of the classic story of growth and overcoming of one's own limits, with ""Barry Lyndon"" Kubrick gives us his customary pessimistic view over the need for control of the human beings over fate or, in other words, the unfathomable number of variables that can change one's life in an instant. Almost comically, the viewer gets used to Barry's continuous shifts from luck to bad fortune in the first half hour, so that the rest of the (long) movie can be played with both the author and the addressee conscious of the rules. The setting in the XVIII century cannot be random: Kubrick alludes to that historic age in almost everyone of his films because it's the purest moment of coexistence of reason and passion, reality and staged society, some of the director's most beloved themes.Kubrick's attention to detail and maniacal perfection in cinematography could even make the movie unbearable for some. Every single shot in three hours of film are blatantly studied and show conceitedly how amazingly the light is used throughout the scenes: most shots are filmed solely with the use of natural light and/or candles, something any other film-maker would've thought utterly impossible (and it would have been, if Kubrick hadn't had the permission to use new lenses produced by NASA!). There is a continuous use of reverse zoom to ""paint"" in front of the audience's eyes pictures which reveal more of the scene as the lens widens. The use of music is also noticeable, with classic tunes employed for superb emotionally resonant editing cuts (I'm thinking about a specific one near the end about Barry's child).""Barry Lyndon"" is where the audience can see how one of Kubrick's greatest talents was to mold his actors into the kind of actors needed for a specific film. In this one, every single character has a certain immobility to him, as if an actual painting was brought to life just as long as it is necessary for the narration. Many scenes are simply frozen, with just one character talking or doing something, and even then the movements are perfectly calibrated and artificial, as if instead of actors Kubrick bought machines for his film. This rule is suddenly broken in moments of rage or pain where the camera becomes shaky and the scene confused too.""Barry Lyndon"" is a fantastic example of Kubrick's maniacal perfection in shooting and between his best works, although not as emotionally or intellectually groundbreaking as his VERY best.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Stanley Kubrick's Citizen Kane!,"After ""A Clockwork Orange"" another of his masterpieces, Stanley Kubrick had already demonstrated his vision of the 1st World War; showed the consequences of the nuclear war between the USA against Russia; the evolution of man through a giant chocolate bar from space; he decided to demonstrate in every detail the rich dynasty from the XVIII century ....... creative wasn't he? Barry Lyndon tells the story of Redmond Barry (Ryan O'Neal) a simple farmer who lives in a small village in Ireland, which begins to live a great passion for his sadistic and persuasive cousin Nora Brady (Gay Hamilton) who makes Barry her loving slave. But when Nora gets a marriage proposal from the English captain John Quin (Leonard Rossiter), Barry challenges the captain to a duel with pistols that he end's up wining, but badly affects his family because the captain was rich and that marriage would save his family from suffered debts. Barry decides to run away to Dublin, but after being robbed on the road, he lists himself in the British Army to fight in the Seven Years' War, but ends up deserting it after the loss of a friend. Barry then ends up fleeing to Prussia and lists himself in the Prussian army and ends up saving the life of his captain becoming his personal spy. But the Prussian captain sends Barry to spy the Irish gambler Chevalier Balibari (Patrick Magee), but Barry just helps Chevalier fleeing the country and becomes his protégé and best friend. And later seduces and marries the noble Lady Honoria Lyndon (Marisa Berenson) where he finally wins the title of Lord Barry Lyndon that long after only brings him suffering and anguish.Kubrick as always delivers a flawless script followed with a beautiful narrative also giving the film the language of the time with the highest English accent put to film, but every moment of the film Kubrick changes the tone of the story. The film is divided in three acts: The 1st act with Barry going poverty in Ireland and finally reaching wealth in England, the film follows a rhythm sometimes romantic when Barry is with her cousin and when he meets a lover in Prussia, and also with a certain humor at times when Barry flees the British army stealing the horses of two soldiers who appear to be gay and when he helps Chevalier flee from Prussia disguising himself of Chevalier while the real one fled; The 2nd act we see the rise of poverty to wealth of Barry and his great personality change, while in Ireland he was a young man with ideas of freedom and now he is a real greedy man thinking only about his fame and wealth and well-being of his little and sweat heir, becoming a real Oswald Kane; On the 3rd and last act after a sad event we see the decline in the life of Barry starting to lose everything that he built, and as I said before becoming a real Oswald Kane someone who has everything but at the same time has nothing .And once again, in technical aspects Kubrick presents us with a real spectacle of photography and direction. Not only the photography that is beautiful, but in the film Kubrick delivers an amazing wardrobe, as if it had been done in that time, and with stunning views (certainly the most expensive Kubrick film before ""Full Metal Jacket"").A film that may not please many or stay in memory, but the demonstration of Kubrick of this era and aesthetic study that he makes of the time through an excellent narrative and a beautiful direction with a luxury cast. Barry Lyndon may be the ""Citizen Kane"" of Kubrick with the philosophical study of man with a beautiful story, with technical aspects on top of the ceiling and the photography at the top of Kubrick, ""Barry Lyndon"" is another of his masterpieces! 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,History
Arguably the Greatest Film Ever Made,"As a huge fan of Kubrick, I am dissappointed that, at least here in the U.S., this film is underappreciated. Although it lacks the social commentary of ""Clockwork Orange"" and the philosophy of ""2001"", I think that this is By Far Kubrick's most beautiful masterpiece. The sets, costumes, and especially cinematography are all utterly amazing. Every single shot is new and wonderful and most of all Memorable. From the opening shot of Barry's father and another man dueling, to the masterful final scene of Lady Lyndon, every aspect of this film is magnificant. In fact, a true connoisseur of cinema can almost sense the overwhelming skill and genius that went into making this film. The acting is very good, not great because the script did not require much acting skill as the narrator of the film gives away practically every event before it happens. I think that this film stands alone as the most beautiful film ever produced, and it alone would qualify Kubrick as one of the greatest directors of all time.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Kubrick In The Late 18th Century,"Stanley Kubrick was one of those directors who made the kinds of films that were so easily misunderstood and misread upon first viewing. From his first film, 1953's FEAR AND DESIRE, up to the 1960 epic SPARTACUS (which he really only had a modicum of control on, and which he basically dismissed), he stayed within traditional filmmaking bounds. But after LOLITA in 1962, he set out to push those filmmaking bounds out of the way; and from that point on, until his last one, 1999's EYES WIDE SHUT, he was a hero to a great many aspiring filmmakers, and a complete enigma to film critics. Most important of all, he never made the same kind of movie twice, which made him perhaps the most utterly unpredictable director of the post-war cinema. His 1975 costume epic BARRY LYNDON is a case in point.In choosing to do a lavish adaptation of the then-little-known book ""The Luck Of Barry Lyndon"" by William Makepeace Thackeray, Kubrick invested his trademark sense of deep, dark irony in depicting an Irish rogue (Ryan O'Neal), who, after winning a duel, goes out in the world to find his fortune. After a series of adventures and misadventures alike, including a stint in Her Majesty's Army, he seems to find the fortune in the guise of Lady Lyndon (Marisa Berenson), but he quickly runs afoul of his newlywed wife's stubborn stepson Lord Bullingdon (Leon Vitali). It all comes down to a duel between him and Vitali in the barn of the Lyndon estateand there can only be ONE winner.Among the many ways that Kubrick defied audience expectations, this film is one that doesn't movie especially fast. At three hours and four minutes, it's no MTV video; but pretty much after the stately interstellar mood of 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY, it would be part-and-parcel of this director not only not to give what the audience expects, but to give them something that requires total concentration. Primarily filmed in England and Ireland over a period of twelve to eighteen months at the mid-point of the 1970s, BARRY LYNDON was a fairly expensive movie, at a cost of $11 million, and was, at the time, perhaps Kubrick's most poorly received film; widely mixed critical and audience reactions in America and England resulted in only modest box office returns there, though the film did clean up in Europe.O'Neal has come in for a fair working-over for his portrayal of Barry Lyndon over the last four decades, but I think it is a very good performance, molded as it were under a thorough taskmaster like Kubrick; and the same could be said for Berenson as Lady Lyndon. BARRY LYNDON also features some excellent turns by such British character actors as Patrick Magee, Phillip Stone, Hardy Krueger, Steven Berkoff, Leonard Rossiter, Godfrey Quigley, George Sewell, and Anthony Sharp.The film justifiably won four Oscars: cinematography (John Alcott); costume design (Milena Canonero); production design (Ken Adam, who worked with Kubrick on DR. STRANGELOVE, and Roy Walker); and musical adaptation (primarily of works by Mozart, Paisiello, Schubert, and Handel) by veteran composer Leonard Rosenman (whose credits included GIANT; FANTASTIC VOYAGE; BENEATH THE PLANET OF THE APRES; and A MAN CALLED HORSE). Particularly notable in the latter is Rosenman's bold orchestration of the Sarabande from Handel's Keyboard Suite #11, which has since become BARRY LYNDON's musical calling card, much as Richard Strauss' ""Also Sprach Zarathustra"" had been for ""2001."" And in terms of the photography, Alcott and camera expert Ed Di Giulio did a great thing by giving Kubrick the idea to use very powerful lenses to shoot a number of complex scenes lit only by candlelight, which has been tried by many a period film that followed in the wake of this movie.A great deal of patience is required for BARRY LYNDON; and, as with many a Kubrick film, this one requires many viewings to really understand the various nuances and themes. But a lot of times this is what great films demand, and BARRY LYNDON is an excellent demonstration of such.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Basically Leaden,"Kubrick must surely rank as the oddest household name director and 'Barry Lyndon' typifies his style: three hours duration, amazing creativity and inspiration, and little sense of a complete film.Lacking in dramatic flow, apparent theme and narrative urgency there is however no denying that I followed all three hours of 'Barry Lyndon' without a lapse of concentration which says a lot for the film making abilities assembled for this production.In fact I was genuinely captivated by the artistry and the film makers confidence (or ego) which are both of splendidly high value in 'Barry Lyndon'.However, as a film fiction, a dramatic tale, I would rate a much lower score and reserve my complements.I have read that Kubrick had intended a Napoleonic war film as his next great project until the underperformance of 'Waterloo' put paid to financing.On balance I feel that more than just his research for that unmade film went into this adaptation of Thackeray's 'The Luck of Barry Lyndon'; indeed having some familiarity with Kubrick's other war films I find it likely that he intended an anti-war, anti ""big men"", anti aristocracy-warrior class Napoleonic film: a radical 1970's take on that eras rampant war making and glorifying.If this were so then the entire tone, and indeed purpose of 'Barry Lyndon' comes into focus: cynical, sceptical, critical of elites and militaries; all these fit the filmmaker and would fit snugly into a hypothetical unmade Napoleon movie.This would explain why the tone of 'Barry Lyndon' is so well developed but the themes and narrative are not and why some reviews feel that Kubrick missed the positives of the literary work he was adapting only to substitute them for less pertinent and challenging features.This then explains the wallowing in human fallacies and failures; the obsession with imperfections and inhumanty and the dallying with fate and destiny as a structure for the misdemeanors and mishaps of Lyndon and other characters.Aside from this speculation 'Barry Lyndon' must be seen to be believed and I consider it's technical gravitas to be so great and effective that it's a truly important and oddly watchable film despite it being mainly unfulfilling as a fictional depiction.Between a 10/10 on one hand and a 5/10 on the other I rate a compound 7/10 score and I recommend to all Kubrick fans and a sly recommendation to anti establishment film fans too!",7.0,Anonymous,History
fascinating historical show,"Fine acting, beautiful photography, haunting music and sure-footed direction show a - probably very realistic - slice of life of the English gentry in the 18th century, which is fascinating by itself. The story is captivating too but leaves a nagging question. The human soul can of  course undergo many changes, yet Barry Lyndon's change from a good-at-heart  lad in part I of the movie to a stupidly cheating husband and excessively  behaving father, either intemperate or overindulgent, in part II is a  little baffling. Kubrick deviated here from Thackeray's original novel,  where the protagonist is somewhat of a rogue throughout, and tried to  add a measure of human development to the adventure story. Yet the change  for the worse happens quite swiftly, and marriage seems to be the cause.  So the movie provides some things dazzling to watch, and some more  things intriguing to contemplate afterwards...",8.0,Anonymous,History

"A powerful dramatic epic, in every sense of the word.","Barry Lyndon, adapted from the novel by William Thackeray, is so tremendously exceptional that it's hard to explain why in a way that hasn't already been said several times over by many reviewers before.Despite its incredibly long run-time, Barry Lyndon manages to keep the viewer engaged and focused on a character study that weaves the most compelling tale.Its visuals amaze; every shot is set up so perfectly, it's stunning just to watch the shots begin to ""unfold"", become fully composed and ""lined up"", for want of a better term. In fact, pretty much everything about this movie is amazing and honed to perfection - the acting, the cinematography, the drama - even just the colours themselves are gorgeous to look at!There's very little criticism I can find with this film - so much so that I'm struggling to find anything I can really criticise right off the top of my head. The only slight criticism I can find is that, at times, it seems the characters' accents can 'slip' out a little here and there i.e. Ryan O'Neal's Irish accent seems to come and go quite frequently.But this isn't enough to truly diminish the film's rating at all.A 10/10 from me doesn't mean the film is perfect - but Barry Lyndon comes unbelievably close.",10.0,Anonymous,History

"A damn fine period piece, carried by a charismatic Ryan O' Neal","Barry Lyndon by William Makepeace Thackeray is, reportedly, the first novel in the English language to feature an anti-hero. Stanley Kubrick's film version retains that aspect to perfection, thus becoming a slightly different period drama from what we are used to.The main character is an Irishman named Redmond Barry (Ryan O' Neal), a con artist who, after killing a rival in a duel, starts traveling around Europe looking for wealth and power. With his charm and ability with words he manages to eventually rise to the upper classes by marrying the recently widowed Lady Lyndon (Marisa Berenson), even though said marriage is far from happy, due to Barry's most annoying talent, that of bringing misery and ruin wherever he goes.Given his perfectionistic reputation, the words ""Kubrick"" and ""period piece"" must have sounded like a magical combination, and indeed it is: the Clockwork Orange director handles every technical aspect of the film with absolute professionalism, from the candle-lit cinematography to the astonishing costumes to the marvelous production design (all of which were given Academy Awards), ensuring one element everyone remembers about this kind of film (the visual seductiveness) is pitch-perfect.The other classic ingredient in costume dramas is a touching love story, but that is not something Kubrick would have told, fond as he was of tales of solitude, unhappiness and destruction. The first is a characteristic of Barry, the other two are what he has a habit of causing: as noble as his intentions may be (and they rarely are) and no matter how close he gets to the right people, he is doomed to remain alone, his own wife being unable to accept his opportunistic schemes. Nevertheless, there is a kind of smugness (in a good way) to him that makes him less unlikable than expected, and O' Neal's charismatic performance (complete with decent accent) keeps the character away from anything resembling a one-dimensional caricature of the average con-man, providing a lightness of touch which saves the film from becoming too bleak during its long running time (almost three hours).Last, but not least, Barry Lyndon would not be half as good without the classical music used as soundtrack, each melancholic tone proving a perfect companion to the humorous but fundamentally sad tale of (lost) love, power and abandon.A must-see for fans of period pieces, Lyndon is also unusual by Kubrick's standards, its lighter tone being a neat counterbalance to the darker subjects the director explored in Paths of Glory, The Killing and A Clockwork Orange. Yes, it is very long. Yes, it requires multiple viewings to be fully understood, just like every other Kubrick movie. But it is also, like all of the notorious perfectionist's pictures, infinitely rewarding and considerably less unsettling than his more famous works.",10.0,Anonymous,History

I haven't quite seen a movie that has been crafted in such a precise manner like this one. You will lose yourself in the beautiful imagery and storytelling. The zoom-out-shots - which Kubrick is well known for - will make your jaw drop multiple times.A great successor to 2001: A Space Odyssey and maybe the best example of Kubrick's talent.

The story of Barry Lyndon...,"""Barry Lyndon"" is a drama movie in which we watch a man's story who is a young farm boy in love with his cousin Nora but Nora gets engaged to the British Captain John Quin. After this we watch him joining the British Army to fight in the Seven Years War. And also after he joins the Prussian Army and when he finish with the army he decides to marry the wealthy Lady Lyndon.I liked the plot of this movie but in some times it was a bit tiring. Also I believe that there was no need for this movie to a be three hour movie but two. Although the direction which made by Stanley Kubrick who also has written it was as I expected magnificent. I also liked the interpretation of Ryan O'Neal who played as Barry Lyndon and he was really good at it. Another interpretation that I liked was Marisa Berenson's who played as Lady Honoria Lyndon.Finally I believe that ""Barry Lyndon"" is a good movie to watch and I think if you watch it you will enjoy it. I also have to say not to have many expectations of action and be reasonable because it's a 1975 movie and think of this before you criticize it.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Stanley Kubrick's Masterpiece,"""It was in the reign of George III that the aforesaid personages lived and quarreled; good or bad, handsome or ugly, rich or poor, they are all equal now."" If you think Barry Lyndon is boring, taste and patience are not your virtues. In my opinion, this is Stanley Kubrick's masterpiece, for it is his most intimate and gorgeous film. Its strengths include its narration, sets, costumes, use of baroque and classical music, but most of all, its cinematography. Using only natural light whenever possible, nearly every shot of this film looks like an 18th century European oil painting fit for a king. Any single frame could be blown up and framed and hung on a wall. Based on William Makepeace Thackeray's novel, it is a rags-to-riches story about a young Irish man who climbs his way up to aristocracy by any means, including marrying a English widow and squandering her wealth. But what goes up always comes down. Some say that the casting of Ryan O'Neal as the protagonist was a mistake, but I disagree. O'Neal possesses the persona of the impressionable and emotionally vulnerable Barry. This is a film mostly devoid of emotion, yet leaves a profound emotional impact. The final result is pure art, which easily merits from me a 10/10 rating.",10.0,Anonymous,History
In my mind THIS is Kubrick's best film,"Excellent movie about Barry Lyndon (Ryan O'Neal) in 18th century England. He's a poor man who marries a rich widow (Marisa Benenson) and tries to assume her husband's place. However it all ends tragically.Many people hate this film. They think it's too long (3 hours+) and boring (when saw it at a revival house years ago most of the audience left during the intermission!). However I think this is director Stanley Kubrick's best film. I was never bored once. The scenery is just gorgeous, the story engrossing and (surprisingly) O'Neal gives an excellent performance. The story does move at a deliberate (meaning slow) pace but that's needed to understand the characters and situations. If you're looking for a quick loud movie with lots of action this isn't for you. However if you're looking for a beautifully made and intricate film about a man's rise and downfall this is for you. I especially love that this doesn't assume that the audience is a bunch of idiots--the narration explains the events calmly and clearly without talking down to you. Easily Kubrick's best film ever. MUCH better than the wildly overrated ""2001"". A 10 all the way.",10.0,Anonymous,History
nice but superficial,"Definitely not a masterpiece if we must do justice to movies deserving the title. First of all, Lady Lyndon has absolutely no character even a superficial one. We have no notion of her feelings towards her husband and her second son. Secondly, the main character has no dilemmas, conflicts not even a soul. Thirdly, the story consists of disconnected parts without aim. Fourthly; Barry's mother reappears as a lady after disappearing as an ordinary villager at the start of he movie.

They are all equal now,"William Makepeace Thackeray's most famous novel, Vanity Fair, has been adapted into several films and TV series. The Luck of Barry Lyndon, later retitled The Memoirs of Barry Lyndon, Esq., hasn't been quite so regurgitated. Originally serialised in the 1840s before becoming a single volume in 1856 (although set in the previous century) it's a rambling text, described by a disinterested narrator, full of satirical swipes at the seventeenth century romantic ideal.Stanley Kubrick's adaptation – a bit of a flop in 1975 – dials down the satire. With Dr Strangelove, Kubrick had taken a cold and sober story (Red Alert) and turned it into a nightmare satirical comedy. With Lyndon he takes a rambunctious and ironic picaresque and turns it into a witty but ultimately sorrowful journey into the black heart of a world that can't accept the orphan foreigner.We begin in Ireland, where a young Redmond Barry (a blank slate Ryan O'Neal), in trying to win the heart of his cousin, challenges the smug Captain John Quin (Leonard Rossiter) to a duel. The event triggers Redmond's exile, and he hits the road, not so much gallivanting around Europe as finding himself stumbling in and out of army units and from one bereft wife's bed to the next.Redmond has ambitions to wealth and status. So, when he comes into contact with Lady Lyndon (an even blanker slate Marisa Berenson), he decides to settle down and take advantage of her money and make himself a gentleman. Lyndon, however, is guarded by her fiercely protective son, Lord Bullingdon (Leon Vitali), who will defend her honour until the violent end.Barry Lyndon employs a realist aesthetic, but it's a beautified and exaggerated realism, like a photo album telling half the story – the pretty bits – as if we were observing the fantasy of an ordered universe. The style is perfect for the self-aggrandising nature of Redmond, who would rather keep himself unknowable in detail, but would gleefully embellish his grander legend.Kubrick predominantly makes use of zooms, as opposed to tracking shots, evoking a sense of flatness similar to a painting. The compositions themselves are reminiscent of 17th and 18th century pieces – at one point Lord Bullingdon effectively walks through Hogarth's ""The Morning After"". When the camera does come off the tripod – for example, during an astonishing brawl at a concert performance – the effect is brilliantly jarring.For a film that keeps its title character in frame but at arm's length for virtually its entire 180-minute running time (save for a brief interlude of contented fatherhood), Barry Lyndon is Kubrick's most moving and heartfelt film. Kubrick used cinema for awe (2001: A Space Odyssey) and anarchy (A Clockwork Orange); but he knew also that cinema is sadness: twenty-four transient events slipping away every second.The sombre rhythm of Barry Lyndon, and the lifetime it covers, is such that we are vitally aware of the passing of time. It is an exercise in anti-tension, with minimal editing and zero revelation. Michael Hordern's ironic narrator frequently informs us of important events before they occur.Kubrick was a proponent of the Soviet Montage school of editing: creating meaning through the juxtaposition of images. And yet with Barry Lyndon the meaning is created more by the events within the frame: the stillness, smallness and slowness of people in vast, beautiful, indifferent spaces.Barry Lyndon may lack the broad humour of the more accessible Dr Strangelove, but Kubrick's acknowledgement of the absurd is still present. Marriage, monogamy, material consumption, and the endless pursuit of money: the sometimes conflicted aspects of the independence-seeking society that sprung from the one we're watching on screen. It's a reflection of our world, today.Yes, Barry Lyndon is a historical film, and it's about history, but it's also about who we are now. It is a film that questions our values and our social convictions. We may laugh or cry at the picaresque rogue and the rigid class divisions he crosses. We may sneer at the loveless marriage born of loneliness at the story's centre. We may despair at the movement from the expansive freedom of the rolling landscape to the closed world of the gated estate. But we may also consider that, unlike Redmond Barry, we have the awareness and the means and the mobility to resist such a fate. Yet so often we choose not to.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Possibly the most beautiful movie ever shot,"Although this movie came out in 1975, I didn't get around to it until about 2003, when I acquired the Stanley Kubrick box set. That's what happens when you listen to critics. The so-called ""experts"" panned this movie when it came out, probably because it was not 2001 or A Clockwork Orange or Dr. Strangelove. So the story isn't groundbreaking, so what. Its a great story, set in a great period and it is lovingly told by Kubrick. What was and is groundbreaking about Barry Lyndon was the cinematography. The whole movie was shot in natural light-a monumental achievement when you think about it. All of the nighttime scenes were shot by candlelight and it puts you right there in the 1760's. I can think of no other period piece movie that conveys the pre-electricity age so accurately-just one of the many reasons why this movie won so many awards, including the Oscar, for Cinematography. Filming at picturesque locales in Ireland, England and Germany didn't hurt, either. You just can't stop watching this movie.Kubrick continued his fabulous use of Classical music to enhance the action on screen in Barry Lyndon.

"So different, and yet so much the same...","The first thing that struck me as I started watching Barry Lyndon (which I'll admit that I knew almost nothing about when I put it on) was that it's a period film, something that I have definitely not come to expect from Kubrick. Granted, I'm a little behind in my detailed look at his filmography, given that more than a quarter century passed between the film's release and me finally getting around to watching it, but I very soon began to see the same Kubrick that I have come to know and love.The film is about a man named Redmond Barry, who we love and then hate and then pity and then admire for his luck and then pity, love, hate, etc. And the most interesting thing about him, of course, is the sheer magnitude of events that happen to him, given that he never for one second has even the slightest bit of control over his own life.He begins with a childish crush on his own cousin, which leads him to engage in a foolish duel, the results of which force him to flee his home without much plan of what to do with himself, other than make himself scarce until things blow over. And we witness the beginning of his truly bizarre adulthood, during which time he is robbed and forced to join the British Army basically just because he had no other choice, and then an increasingly unexpected series of circumstances and events take place that ultimately lead him to the most unexpected conclusion.The film itself is structured in an interesting way, in that it is filmed and presented with such an emotionless detachment. As Ebert pointed out, there is a narrator that gives away any important events in advance to remove any sense of tension or suspense, and he narrates as though he were talking about field mice rather than real people. As such, the film is able to come across more as an exploration of Kubrick's ideas of human nature rather than another cloying period romance. Bravo! I have read (and am not surprised by) a lot of people saying that the movie is intolerably boring, which I must say is to be expected. Like so many Kubrick films, it is prohibitively long at just over three hours, and it is interesting in that it gives a feeling that nothing ever happens from beginning to end, and yet there is ALWAYS something happening.Personally I absolutely loved it. It reminded me of another unique and enormously entertaining period film, Tom Jones, with it's brilliant comic performance by Albert Finney. Recenltly I have been going back and watching all of the Kubrick movies that I haven't seen as of yet, and even at it's prodigious length and slow pace (which is a Kubrick trademark if I've ever seen one), Barry Lyndon is still one of my favorites, at least of the overlooked classics. It is a bit of a commitment, but well worth it.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Obliquely Napoleonic,"In the early 1970s, Director Kubrick wanted to make a film about Napoleon. For various reasons, that effort failed to materialize. But Kubrick put his research on Napoleon and that historical era to good use later, in a story about a fictional character of that same time period, Barry Lyndon, a roguish young Irishman whose ambition and opportunism would carry him into splendorous surroundings of Europe's high and mighty, despite one setback after another.In ""Barry Lyndon"" what we get is thus a Napoleon-like character: clever, charming, calculating, and commanding. And we follow this character over an extended period of his life, as he interacts with the grandiose and powerful, en route to a destiny dictated as much by uncontrollable fate as by his own selfish desires.Given the film's very slow pace, I like the way the unseen narrator explains the plot as it proceeds. Such a script device ensures an overview approach to the story, so that we don't get lost in details. Implicit here is the nullification of both suspense and mystery. The title character's ever-changing circumstances, however prosaic, and his responses to those changes, are what matter. The narrator functions thus as an impartial, emotionless observer, a stand-in for Kubrick himself.Production values rate quite high as does the cinematography. Interior scenes especially look really good, with those lit candles amid colorful costumes and makeup. Indeed, some scenes convey an air of romanticized unreality, as characters pose like statues in a museum. The classical background music thus completes the Enlightenment-age mood.""Barry Lyndon"" is a period film with colorful costumes and some interesting characters. With a runtime of three hours and a big budget, it comes across as self-conscious and forced. Its stiffness, as displayed in stagy acting and stilted dialogue, renders it hard to like. I found it not particularly entertaining. But the film does succeed at giving viewers a Napoleon-like character, and a pretty good feel for what life must have been like among the aristocratic elite in that time and place.",7.0,Anonymous,History

This can obviously be done with skilled traditional lighting and viewers generally couldn't care less, nor should they.This film is over three hours. Not much of a surprise that a story based on an obscure 19th century novel about a fictional character in Ireland didn't find a big audience.With some melodramatic music, this could be chopped up into maybe 10 parts and be quite similar to traditional American day time soap operas.

I'm ashamed I'd never heard of it before seeing a documentary on Stanley Kubrick this past summer.I was thoroughly impressed with Ryan O'Neal's portrayal of this 18th century man trying to move up the social ladder of Europe, which must have been nearly impossible for a common Irishman to do back then. He is smug, subtle, calculating, and charming when his character demands it from him. Make no mistake, though. He is no hero. His character is flawed, and he pays the price for it in more ways than one by the end of the film.There are plenty of things to rave about with this film. As many have stated, it's like watching beautiful paintings come to life in each scene. The background performers all seem to freeze when the camera isn't focused on them. This adds to the effect. I've never seen another film do this. It works very well. The story is paced VERY deliberately. If you care about the characters, this won't bother you a bit. For those out there who cannot stomach long films (and there are a lot of you) this film will be intolerable. Few people I know would enjoy this film, so I would never even mention it to them.There is one thing in particular that bothers me about this film. The way the story unfolds never allows us to get to know many of the characters very well. Since Barry is always moving around from one place to another, we hardly get to know many of the people he meets. Most of them seem interesting, but they're always gone from the story in a flash. One character in particular, The Chevalier, looks like he will be a very influential person in Barry's life, but as soon as Barry weds Lady Lyndon, we never see the Chevalier again! What the hell? Is that what caused Barry's downfall? Losing his mentor? Hmmm.In sum, this really is a great film. It's actually more than just a film. It's an experience. My advice to everyone who hasn't seen it is simple: Give it a chance. Some day when you have three hours to kill, just turn out all the lights, plop the film in the ol' dvd player and sit back and enjoy it. Most people will appreciate it, but others will no doubt fall asleep. The film is an acquired taste, but a rich one at that!It is certainly worth 9 of 10 stars to the Hound!One last thing: Stanley! Come back to us, man! Please!!!!! The world can't take another Michael Bay film!",9.0,Anonymous,History
Patient and Engrossing,"The reviews of the movie that describe it as ""slow"" are absolutely correct, but in a good way. If the movie were sped up at all, the passage of time would seem rushed. The plot is intriguing, at times making you dislike Lyndon but at other times making you pity him. However, the costumes, scenery and lighting make the movie fascinating to watch.I originally thought this was going to be overly-dry, but was pleasantly surprised to see classic- Kubric humor stuck into the plot at just the right times. Beyond the costumes and settings, the plot paints a fascinating outline of life in the 1800s. I just wish they would have focused more on the social structure, and I wonder how realistic some of the plot would have been at the time (e.g. being able to move around the continent so easily).Overall, a great movie!",9.0,Anonymous,History

One of the greatest work of the Legend Late Stanley Kubrick. Take a Bow Legend!!,"Barry Lyndon is a period drama film directed by Late Stanley Kubrick. The film stars Ryan O'Neal, Marisa Berenson, Late Patrick Magee, Late Hardy Krüger, Gay Hamilton and Late Leon Vitali.An Irish rogue, gets into a relationship with a rich widow and cheats his way to the top of the 18th-century British society, by assuming the identity of her dead husband.The film is based on the 1844 novel The Luck of Barry Lyndon by Late William Makepeace ThackerayStanley Kubrick is one of my favorite directors and I had always cherished his work and in my opinion Barry Lyndon is one of his most impressive work and the depiction of 18th Century is just perfect, it also should be noted that even a very subtle detail of that period has been done with perfection. The film was not a great success which was being expected but still for me it's one of the finest work by the legend and surely a misunderstood film if not underrated. The film pace of the film is slow and the film is lengthy but for a true lover of art will not be bothered by this.The execution of the film is superb and the story is well set up, considering the era of the film the slow pace of the film was much needed to make up the perfect base of the film. The era of 18th century has been captured with utmost authentication which is beautifully backed by amazing cinematography and great music.Acting is good with Ryan O'Neal the most impressive one followed by Leon Vitali. Marisa Berenson could be a little weak spot in this department.The climax of the film is equally impressive and gives a great closure to this cinematic marvel by one of the maverick of world cinema. If you're a true film lover then this is a must watch for everyone. Take a Bow Legend.",10.0,Anonymous,History
One of Kubrick's worst movies.,"I am very fond of Stanley Kubrick, Spartacus is one of my favorite movies, but Barry Lyndon disappointed me, I expected a lot more from the film, he has a spectacular photograph, a good cast, good acting, impeccable costumes but there are many problems, the film Is very slow, it's very long, I watched it once in a while, but it's a movie that a lot of people will watch in up to 3 days, because it will be boring, the direction of Stanley Kubrick is good, you see your characteristics in that movie , The biggest problem of Barry Lyndon is the same pace, the film could have been a 20 minutes shorter than improvement a little, the script is one of the culprits for this, Barry Lyndon is an watching film, but it is one of the weakest of the Kubrick I watched, it sins in several aspects, mainly the rhythm.

A very Scenic movie,"If you love the olden cinematography then give this movie a watch. Seriously the movie is worthy of Oscar for its backgrounds, costumes and art. These must be your priority while watching this movie. There is an amazing background music, which will never let you off. Apart from this there is nothing much to the movie, it has a simple script where initially I felt like Forrest Gump but soon after wards it became pretty much clichéd, so I was not interested in watching the second half as you could predict what would happen. But the forest part till the intermission id quite entertaining with all the lovely sceneries and women, costumes and what not. From an art point of view this movie would feel like a beautiful painting but do not expect more from the movie, there are many scenes which seem to be not useful to the script or bearing no importance at all, but still the compensates all these errors with an amazing background score.

Just sumptuous,"I regard Barry Lyndon as a highly distinct film. As I have seen many 20 years olds like me commenting on the film, I was motivated to respond.The first complain that comes to mind is the narration. This is a told story, not one when the viewer is left to discover the outcomes from its characters' adventures. And - mind you - it is a narrated movie par excellence. So some viewers are bothered when events are described before they actually happen, including the ending. I think this is the beauty of it. We here assume the role of the admirers. We contemplate the scenes, discover the smell of the era. Kubrick knows this is not a movie that needs to move fast, because it has a remote subject. The viewers are left the necessary moments to relate and comprehend the events that happened in times when man lived quite a different life. A life candlelit by night, instable and war-struck, insecure. The family theme is at a sad period. Duels are occur on an almost daily basis, and their leading to death is treated awkwardly... fair.Most of these are surely elements that we have to believe, in some sense be hypnotized in order to believe them. Ultimately this lead us to see that the values implied are timeless. One is left pondering at the end on this matter: what elements (life stages, truth and lies, courage, etc) are still present today, and in what form, with what consequences, etc.? This exercise is mandatory for a great movie - even if Barry Lyndon is indeed a story, it is not the straightforward story.All in all I believe we are presented a solid fragment of life from the 18th century. It is just for its complexity, its ups and downs, the long and winding road that its main character follows that mark this effort a candidate for a masterpiece.Try seeing it as gentle and appealing introduction to history, painting and music!",9.0,Anonymous,History
One of the most beautiful looking films ever made,"I can't get over how incredible this film's cinematography is. It's such an easy thing to point out when watching it but what John Alcott, (the cinematographer) has done for this movie is something that really elevates the whole thing to a different level, one that is unparalleled by many films today. The use of Steadicam in Kubrick's The Shining is something I'll always remember so fondly of but that technology wasn't even invented by the 70's. Instead, Barry Lyndon showcases numerous sequences depicting the lush countryside-esque landscape that the story is set in and makes use of natural lighting in both indoor and outdoor scenes. It's important to note the indoor parts as the visuals for the interior scenes also look amazing and detailed. Many of the scenes that take place in a house or some building are lit by candles, which would easily be a detriment to the visuals but works well in this case. Pausing the film during these moments of great cinematography would be the same thing as looking at a painting because they really resembled the looks of an actual piece. The framing, with its double shots and closeups, are also nothing short of perfection, as they keep the focus on the subjects whenever necessary while being mindful of the background.The story of Barry Lyndon is essentially a man's journey from rags to riches. Having this premise also be a period piece can be challenging because it imposes a lot of standards on the audience to believe in to be able to fully enjoy the film. I really liked it though, and this has to do with the presentation. I've said enough about the cinematography but the music and acting are also deserving of the praise they receive. I myself don't have a favorite actor or performance from this film because I felt like all of them kind of blended together and helped with the overall world-building, which is good.Like 2001: A Space Odyssey, this film also has an intermission, which I appreciated. Barry Lyndon is three hours long, and while I very much enjoyed the film in its entirety, I did feel the runtime by the time it was over. This also has to do with how the second part of the movie slows down, as it's in charge of steering the story towards the end. The intermission got me thinking a bit about modern films, especially because ones that are 2.5+ hours long are going to be made for as long as film exists. I definitely wouldn't mind having intermissions for newer movies and I'm curious as to why we don't really see them anymore. It's one thing to absorb everything that's happening on screen in one long sitting but making a film built around segmented parts with an intermission might make for a more easier movie-going experience these days. Having a short pause midway though might help the audience take a minute to reflect on everything that's happened and that's definitely something I did while watching Barry Lyndon which prepared me for the rest of the film.One of Kubrick's best, but The Shining is still my favorite. Thank god for John Alcott.",9.0,Anonymous,History
"Okay, certainly NOT one of the best films by Kubrick","Damn, what a boring film. Shallow characters with no depth, and poor acting! The screenplay also sucks. I mean, WTF is that scene with Barry and his cousin? Looks like something you'd find in a porn film. The events on this film are so dumb and unbelievable, is a joke. It has great cinematography, I mean, very great. But so what? Is all meaningless. I would call it a style over substance kind of film, if it had any substance. Worst Kubrick film just behind Fear and Desire. Doesn't even looks like a Kubrick film. Too bad is so overrated nowadays. Still, its rather watchable after the first hour. But don't expect nothing above average apart from Kubrick's direction. The cinematography is indeed one of the greatest ever, if not the greatest.

Thirty years have gone by....,"I received this DVD for Christmas 2004. Nearly thirty years have gone by since I saw it in a theater. This film is even more beautiful than I remembered it being. You can pause the DVD at almost any point in the story and have a picture that could be framed and hung on your wall. Just don't watch it if you are in a hurry. There is nothing (NOTHING) about this story which would captivate the Sesame Street generation, who are used to quick cuts, action, and rapid mood changes to keep them alert. This film takes three hours, longer if you take advantage of the much needed intermission. It is slow paced, slow acted, slow and deliberate in its frequent slow Zoom-outs, detaching us from the action (such as it is) rather than drawing us in.

"Barry Lyndon, Kubrick, exploitation and control","I am sorry that the 197 earlier comments here are just too many to read to see if anyone else has ever made this point before, but I suspect I might have an original perspective on Kubrick and on Barry Lyndon.Kubrick directed only ten films from ""Paths of Glory"" in 1957 to ""Eyes Wide Shut"" in 1999. He had certain pet themes that he fit into his movies whenever he could. For example, telephones: the crucial call from the general to the artillery battery in ""Paths or Glory""; several key phone calls in ""Strangelove""; the charming video phone call from orbit to the cute little girl and the birthday call from earth to the Jupiter ship in ""2001""; and the telephone on the back of the tank in ""Full Metal Jacket"".But the dominant theme in all Kubrick's major films is one form or another of domination, manipulation, control, exploitation. Some of the examples are obvious: ultra-violence and brainwashing in ""Clockwork Orange"", slavery in ""Spartacus"". Others are more implicit: supernaturally induced madness in ""Shining""; boot camp and nightmarish combat in ""Full Metal Jacket""; obsession and seduction in ""Lolita"" or ""Eyes Wide Shut"". And on the grandest galactic scale, the manipulation of human evolution in ""2001"".So what about ""Barry Lyndon""? There are all kinds of manipulations and exploitations to be found in the plot, but ""Barry"" goes a huge step beyond these.-------- S P O I L E R S --------To explain... Thackeray and/or Kubrick have an artistic problem. They are telling the tale of a generally worthless human, so rotten that his own son challenges him to a duel, and Barry's only moral act in the entire three-hour movie is to refuse to shoot his son. The problem is multiplied for Kubrick by casting bland, white-bread Ryan O'Neal. Why should we care about Barry Lyndon at all?Yet somehow Thackeray/Kubrick make us care, if not for Barry, then at least for what happens to him. That is what great story-telling does. By the time of the father-son pistol duel, with its gut-wrenching tension, we really are concerned that one will kill the other and it might be the end of Barry Lyndon.So when Barry falls, we don't know if the wound is mortal or not. After Barry is lifted into a carriage and is driven off, the narrator says words to the effect of ""Nobody knows what became of Barry Lyndon. Some say he went to London and died in poverty, and some say he went to Paris and died a rich man. But none of it matters because they are all dead now"". But WAIT! I WANT TO KNOW WHAT HAPPENED TO HIM!!Then I realized how silly that was of me. Barry and all the others in the story are fictional characters; none of them had ever been alive to begin with. The ultimate manipulation here is the storyteller's manipulation of his audience. I don't know if the role of puppet-master belongs to Thackeray or Kubrick or both in what proportion, but someone pulled a fast one on me and I loved it.",9.0,Anonymous,History
This is not a good movie,"Stanley Kubrick is well known and perhaps the best director of Hollywood or perhaps the whole world, but Barry Lyndon is not a great movie. The very concept of a movie is to entertain people through any means; whether it's through thrill, or suspense or emotions or drama or comedy or any out of the world experience which this movie ain't contain a bit. It's a stale British Setup with monotonous narration and a presentation that seems to resemble that of a History Channel (or NGC). There's no craziness and spikes in the movie and the viewers remain quite aloof of what's happening. There's no strong flavor of good or evil, happy or sad but it's just long, boring and gloomy life of the main character. It seems Kubrick really became bored while living on outskirts of London, the psyche of which being shown through this film. Film creates sensations, and simply don't present the very mediocrity plain life which most of people usually are going through. This is one of the movies in which Kubrick became too lazy to even go to sets to direct it. Just cameraman, actors and writers flipped it by themselves.

One of the best period pieces I've ever seen,"Far too many period pieces these days look like what they are -- 20th or 21st century actors putting on historical costumes (which may or may not be accurate) and acting out a story with no attempt whatsoever to really get into the mindset of the period in question. I think that exceptions to this rule are becoming more common these days (Master and Commander was very impressive) but only when helmed by especially conscientious and meticulous directors. And no director was ever more conscientious and meticulous than Stanley KubrickWith Barry Lyndon, Kubrick does for the period picture what 2001 did for science fiction, what Dr. Strangelove did for the comedy, and what Spartacus may or may not have done for the costume epic. There's little enough by way of definite plot here, just Ryan O'Neil trying to make his way through life in the 18th century as best he can. It was a period where society's chosen ones could live like gods, and the unlucky could descend to sub-human squalor, and it was perfectly possible to do both in a single lifetime. It was also the Age of Reason, where weakness of nerve or instinct to self-preservation was considered much less important than a gentleman's agreement.It's passed into film legend that no artificial lighting whatsoever was used in filming. This wasn't quite the case -- it was unavoidable for a few scenes -- but Kubrick was hell-bent on minimizing it as much as possible to get the authentic effect of rooms lit all by candlelight. Kubrick's background in still photography was apparent in A Clockwork Orange, but he's taken on a painter's eye here -- logical since 18th century painting offered an entire world of research material.This is, in the end, a very visual film. As such, the level of acting isn't as memorably ingenious as in some of Kubrick's other films. An excellently written narration track and some ingenious text at the climax is needed to really tie everything together. But this movie apparently still gave Ryan O'Neil's career enough of a boost that two years later he ended up headlining A Bridge Too Far with the likes of Sean Connery, Michael Caine, Gene Hackman, and Elliot Gould. Just another day's work for Kubrick. This isn't his best-known work, but it's still a masterpiece.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Pretty Good Kubrick Fare,"Stanley Kubrick, my favorite filmmaker, has made MUCH better films.  Not to mention much faster paced films.  This doesn't compare the The Shining or Clockwork Orange but it is still passable entertainment.  I am amazed to see Ryan O'Neal in a Kubrick film.  This was made before Ryan was all fat and washed up like he is now.  But if you like Dangerous Liason type costume dramas you will enjoy this if you can handle the very tedious pacing.

More than just a lens choice,"One question remains as the credit rolls, why did Kubrick want so much to make this movie? As accomplished and prized as this movie is, it is not as fondly remembered as other Kubrick movies. It is often called The Forgotten Kubrick, or the ugly duckling, still it remains a curiosity, usually studied in film classes for its use of NASA sourced ultra fast lenses in order to film candle light illuminated scenes. Kubrick decided to use the preproduction work already done on a Napoleon project shelved by MGM a few years earlier and use it in Barry Lyndon, but was he in love with the project? As much as I enjoy the attraction of the technical challenge, is hard to consider Kubrick making a movie just for a technical tour-de-force.Nowadays anyone can achieve better results using a $500 camera and lenses, and no-one is willing to invest in another large production period drama with beautiful cinematography, exception made for Ridley Scott decision to touch the Napoleon curse, based on the reviews and box office this will forever warn any future director to never touch the subject again.As opposed to Kubrick trademark hidden meanings in film, BL is very much WYSIWYG with even a narrator on hand to make sure the viewer is not led astray, it is an unwritten law that if you use a narrator, you failed at directing, in his defense most often the narration was not needed. Was there any life lessons? Apart from, wars at the time were like a constant Russian roulette.. and some crooks get lucky and some don't. Or as the movie could be interpreted, life is a card game, you may win sometimes by cheating, but eventually you have to do with the cards you were dealt. As I cannot explain the attraction of the script to Kubrick, what is in it for the viewer? Granted it has some beautiful, painting inspired tableaux, great acting, even by the kids, and despite my dislike for Ryan O'neal, but at 3 hours long, this movie feels longer than The Batman at same running time.Now that I Think of it, I wonder if first time I watched it some 30 years ago, if I just got bored of it and didn't pay attention or did I fall asleep?",7.0,Anonymous,History
Stanley Kubrick's most perfect film,"It took awhile for me to finally see this film. I just didn't want to see a ""costume drama"". I was expecting a cheesy Lifetime quality film. Wow... was I wrong.

Everything from the acting, cinematography, music, to the screenplay is top notch.If you're a true Stanley Kubrick fan, meaning you don't watch his films solely for the sex and violence, and actually enjoy his talents as an artist, check out Barry Lyndon.

Arguably the best period piece of all time,"Barry Lyndon is a film that covers a wide range of dramatic subjects which near the edge of melodrama, but skillfully never steps over. Ambition, love, tragedy, hatred, courage, power, lust; I could go on and on. True, other films have depicted these topics in 18th century Europe, many obviously done so very well. However, this is a Kubrick picture and he has brought all his talent to the forefront here. Each frame, as usual, is visually arresting, photographed as if it were a painting of that era with actual motion. The story never meanders, despite the fact that the movie relates a large portion of a man's life and career. The acting, though low key in comparison to the lush surroundings, nonetheless achieves the aim of each actor. The final scene with Lyndon's son in particular is heartbreaking. Kubrick's choice of music, both original and borrowed, fits perfectly into key segments and generally heightens the mood.Barry Lyndon is Kubrick's best in my opinion, a work of art that transcends decades.",10.0,Anonymous,History

We all thought that the movie was as boring as the book and we had gone to see it because the book was so boring we wanted to avoid finishing it. In one scene you watch a horse's hoof trot for what seems to be at least 5 minutes and this has nothing to do with the plot. It wasn't until I saw this listing that I learned the movie was thought to be Oscar material. Frankly, I didn't see it.

Great Kubrick twist on the costume genre.,"The film is visually flawless, and its scenic beauty is shaped and manipulated very well by Stanley Kubrick. The plot is of little consequence, a simple rise and fall story which Kubrick tries to add flare and satire too. His attention to symmetry, lighting, and cinematography is impeccable. However it lacks that feeling of bold experimentation and excitement that is found in his more well-known films such as ""A Clockwork Orange"" and ""A Space Odyssey"". It is definitely not the most interesting Kubrick film simply because the material was not as strong or moving. Yet the Kubrickan elements found in all his works are portrayed with great effort in ""Barry Lyndon"". Kubrick works within the genre to make a more unconventional comment on the aristocracy of the times and primal human nature in us all throughout all walks of life. Kubrick uses the actors as mere pawns of their social and natural barriers. It is a period film without significant love interest or much action, a rare thing in the genre. This works to add a twist to the often stuffy and trivial crap that most period films put forward. Kubrick had a greater design for the film as opposed making a by the numbers costume drama. Not his finest but a must for all Kubrick fans and someone interested on a different and interesting take on the genre.",8.0,Anonymous,History

The definitive Kubrick masterpiece,"By this time Kubrick had achieved anything a film maker could dream on achieve. He had roughly on his pocket 3 masterpieces of three different genres, and his last movie had cause hell in his personal life.So apparently Barry Lyndon came in a time when the director was looking for some peace of mind, and the picture really let's this feeling reach he audience. And this movie shows us so much of Kubrick talent, that is the ultimate testament to the man's genius.Barry Lyndon is the definition of what a real art movie must be, without any pretentiousness at all. Screenplay, Costume and Set Design, Acting and Directing were all in perfect balance. Each frame could become a picture on a wall.The movie is slow, yes, but this rhythm is essential to the story. We are following a man's life journey, there's no need to rush. The details are also worth of notice.

A technical achievement that drags a bit in places.,"As someone who appreciates classic films, perhaps I had my hopes set a little too high for Barry Lyndon (1975). Going in, I already knew the technical challenges director Stanley Kubrick had to overcome to film indoors and by candlelight with no extra lighting. Of course, if that was the main thing I knew about this film before I actually sat down and watched it, that should have told me something about how boring the plot would be. Then again, even a master of cinema like Kubrick can only do so much with mediocre material.I will give some credit where it's due, though. Most of this movie did contribute to the tension of the climax. If certain events hadn't transpired in the way they did, Barry's (Ryan O'Neal) life would have been much different. Then again, the whole ""rags to riches"" storyline seemed overdone, even for the mid-1970s. And sure, duels can be exciting-with the honor and lives of men on the line-but I found this film had more duels than a Yu-gi-oh episode. This contributed to some of my boredom.That's not to say that Barry Lyndon isn't completely unwatchable. Like I alluded to earlier, the cinematography looks fantastic. Most scenes could have easily been oil paintings hanging in museums (probably why the pacing felt so slow). The costuming and music were also exemplary, as would be expected of a period piece like this. I could definitely see where future films (like The Favourite (2018)) drew their inspiration. And while Kubrick's versatility certainly makes this film a good part of his repertoire, I don't think I could place it in my top five favorite Kubrick films.A technical achievement that drags a bit in places, I give Barry Lyndon 3.5 stars out of 5.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Carefully Crafted Masterpiece,"Barry Lyndon is a special film. Stanley Kubrick has carefully and lovingly crafted a brilliant tale, utilizing the brilliant technique of featuring almost exclusively natural lighting for authenticity. Through his ingenious story-telling abilities, Kubrick has crafted a film that just passes over the 3 hour runtime, but never once drags or drones. Every second of screen time matters and is accounted for. The character-building is second to none, giving the audience a cast of characters they can easily care about and find a connection with, which makes the more emotional moments resonate so much more deeply. The costuming on this film is top notch, the cinematography is gorgeous (this may very well be the most beautiful Kubrick film to look at, and that's including his magnum opus, 2001: A Space Odyssey). It's crafted to Kubrickian proportions, with a fantastic score to compliment the visuals, some incredible action scenes and some of the tensest drama that I've seen on screen in a while.
To promote the digital version of this film, Warner Bros. proudly declares that this is ""One of the most beautiful films ever made,"" and it's easy to dismiss such claims as being (obviously) hastily written pleasantries designed to sell more copies of the film, but there's some serious merit behind the claim they make about this film. It's not common for me to invest so heavily in such a long film, but Kubrick grabbed me in and didn't let me go, and from start to finish every single note in this film hit exactly the way Kubrick intended it to. Another masterpiece from the master, and without question my favorite of the Kubrick films I've seen (which is about half).",10.0,Anonymous,History
A cold but beautiful work of art,"While not for all tastes, this is an excellent filmIt has been filmed as if each individual frame of film is a painting.The story is archetypal but interesting, telling the story of the rise and fall of an anti-hero. Ryan O'Neal in the title role is a real surprise and is engaging despite being a character that is deliberately dislike-able. In fact as the character rises up the social ladder, with setbacks on the way, I began to sympathise with the character more. When the character makes it, the film then shifts to be a study of hubris and the character becomes deliberately dislike-able again. Even when the character undertakes a surprising redemptive turn, it is appropriate, and perhaps inevitable that the character becomes subject to the very type the act that he would be more than happy to meat out to other individuals, and certainly does to his stepson, played well by Leon Vitali as his older form, but absolutely brilliantly by in the younger form by child actor, now TV director Dominic Savage. The young Bullingdon comes across as more mature than some of the adult characters that surround him. Other performances are all good and appropriate for the story. Kubrick again makes use of performers he has worked with before, notably Philip Stone as the Lyndon's family lawyer, Leonard Rossiter and the cowardly Captain Quinn, Anthony Sharpe as Lord Hallam, and and excellent Godfrey Quigley as Captain Grogan, the only character with genuine warmth and integrity in the story.The plot progresses at a steady pace. As a viewer, you have to be patient to be rewarded by it. Less patient viewers will see it as boring but then Kubrick as a director expects you to be patient. He was patient with actors in his films, as evidenced by very long shooting schedules and working with actors not to rush when planning their performances; he was patient putting his films together is post production. He therefore expects audiences to be patient.The story is in effect a series of rises and falls of fortune, culminating in a fall at the end of the film. In fact, this major fall is the character's own making, and I did feel frustrated that the character started making a series of wrong choices, not helped by the hubristic attitude of Lyndon's mother, who is well played by Irish actor Marie Kean. Therefore, it was clear that the film had succeeded in drawing me in despite the objective, observational style of the film, with an effective narration by Michael Hordern.Technical credits are outstanding, which is typical for Kubrick films of this period. John Alcott's photography gives great realism to the period, lighting scenes to suggest natural light sources, rather than more typical feature film compositional lighting. Camera-work is more subtle than in previous Kubrick films. However, Kubrick does make very effective use of slow zooms to help tell the story. It is no surprise that Alcott won an Oscar for his work. Design by Ken Adam (as production designer), Roy Walker(as art director), Vernon Dixon (as set dresser) frequent Kubrick collaborator and 3 time Oscar winner Milena Canonero(costumes), and Ulla-Britt Söderlund (costumes) is nothing short of brilliant and totally convinces you of the time period the film takes place in. They all deservedly won Oscars. Composer Leonard Rosenmann also won an academy award for his excellent work adapting existing classical pieces, but huge credit has to go to Kubrick for his choices, that totally suit the film.Kubrick marshals everything with his usual panache. While the film is a tragedy, the few action scenes, which hinge around Napleonic type warfare with muskets, is brilliantly executed, but doesn't come across as the director showing off, but as being entirely integrated into the story.Be patient, open minded and you'll throughly enjoy it.",10.0,Anonymous,History
May be the most Overlooked movie of all time!,"This may be one of the most underrated movies of all time!This movie moves slow, and may be the reason it has such a bad rating compared to how good it actually is!

But this is still his most overlooked movie, and no one ever mentions this movie!Kubrick have made many of my favorite movies, among them: The shining, and a clockwork orange, but i consider this movies as good as these! No one else seems to have seen this movie, and amongst them who have seen it, never seem to like it as much as i do. Incredibly few people seem to have seen this movie the same way i have!This is in my opinion a must-see!

Rise and fall of an ambivalent gentleman,"I thought about George Sanders each time I saw this absolute pearl, jewel, so amazing, surprising, terrific to discover for the first time and every time after. Only Kubrick could give us such inventive and twisted story. The main character's role could have easily been given to George Sanders if it had been made forty years earlier. This ambivalent gentleman cynical, ambiguous in his behaviour, nasty and endearing, a gentleman whose fate can't leave you indifferent. But the most important to say and remember is of course the production design, the quality of settings, light, camera work, directing, no matter the lenghts from time to time. Kubrick at his forever perfection.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Sheer splendour,"Barry Lyndon is as close to perfect as a motion picture can come. From the opening scene of the dueling figures in the distance, offset by glorious Irish countryside, the viewer is utterly engrossed in the experience.The film moves with a pace that is both gentle and swift. The rambling adventures of the rouge Redmond Barry are comic, sad, exciting and desperate. It's 3 hour running time is not tribute to a complex plot, rather a complex character, who our perception towards constantly changes. In one moment he is the hero, the next the villain. This is not forced upon us though in obvious acts of bravery or treachery, rather it is more subtly realised by the viewer.Kubrick's films usually deal with the dehumanising of mankind. This is certainly an important plot element in Barry Lyndon, especially in the second half, where Barry resigns to his fate, and the viewer with him. The script of the epilogue however, is perhaps the greatest redeeming example of Kubrick's love for humanity as well, as he describes all people of the era, whether rich or poor, handsome or ugly, as 'all equal now'. Kubrick, hailed as a genius, has now joined them, but testaments like Barry Lyndon will live as long as the cinema itself.",,Anonymous,History
Hadn't seen this in DECADES...,"As ""Barry Lyndon"" (1975 release from the UK and Ireland; 185 min) opens, we are in the mid-18th century as we are introduced to Redmond Barry, an Irish lad whose father was killed in a duel. He falls in love with Nora, who then is courted by English Capt. Quinn. Redmond challenges Quinn to a duel, and kills him, forcing him to flee... At this point we are 15 minutes into the movie...Couple of comments: this oeuvre (don't just call it a movie) from writer-producer-directed has been misunderstood and/or underappreciated for many years. While at first sight it feels very differently from earlier works like ""2001"" and ""A Clockwork Orange"", the movie in fact fits alongside very nicely. With 20/20 hindsight, it now also provides an invaluable time capsule to what the world looked like in the 18th century while filmed 200 years later. The movie is now also famous for its photography, using only natural light (and with many candlelit scenes for good measure). While a technical feat and feast, the movie suffers from the inexplicable miscasting of Ryan O'Neal in the title role. What was Kubrick thinking? There are no words. THen also this: the production budget for this movie was $11 million (about $60 million in today's money). Then watch the film and just look at the amazing production sets, including the reenactments of various battle scenes. If such a film were to be made again today, it would likely cost a couple of hundreds of million dollars, easily,I literally hadn't seen ""Barry Lyndon"" in DECADES, and stumbled onto it the other night on HBO Max. I didn't recall much of the story line, and ended up watching it in amazement. The movie is now closing in on its 50th anniversary. If you have an interest in a period piece the likes of which you likely haven't see before, I'd readily suggest you (re)check it out, and draw your own conclusion.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Barry Lyndon makes slow a virtue.,"The usual knock on this movie is that it is slow and way too long, long long.  That is actually what makes it great.  The WAY it is those things.It's a matter of how you approach it. That it has a languid pace is undeniable -- and exactly what Kubric intended.  Think of it as an extended music video -- for languid, classical chamber music (or sweet sorrow funerial music) and you will be more in the right frame of mind to fully enjoy this movie.  (Actually, I wish the DVD had the same option which Amadeus has -- to run with the visuals and the music score only, when viewing for the upteenth time.)This movie absolutely is a historical ""costume drama"" -- and like most of Kubric's movies, takes that form to new heights of expression.While 2001 is visually gorgeous and intellectually fascinating -- but emotionally ice cold, Barry Lyndon is emotionally warm like a nice soaking bath -- after sex and a shared bottle of wine.Visually stunning in every way. With a plot, though not without its complications, still pushed way to the background.You want driving action?  Try Dr. Strangelove or Clockwork Orange -- not to mention The Shining.  Kubric is simply astonishing..",10.0,Anonymous,History
A successful amusement.,"It was good but not a true great we expect from Kubrick in his prime.It humoured me enough to keep watching throughout the whole 3 hours and was never bored. The great character actors brought a humorous edge to it most notably Murray Melvin and Leonard Rossiter.It looked beautiful and the editing was sharp, an editing style that accompanied and complemented the wonderful music for long sections, like it coasted along with the musical beats.I thought the pacing was good and never lingered longer than it needed to, even though sometimes shots intentionally lingered which I did like mainly due to the wonderful cinematography. Every scene looked like an oil painting, camera barely moving and holding the frame. It was a beautiful looking film.I was only really gripped once during the final pistol duel and that whole segment was pushed along by 11 minutes of music from where Lord Bullingdon entered the drink house Lyndon occupied until just after the final shot of the duel.I don't think the film was meant to keep you gripped, like I said it humoured, it was an amusement. That's what I think this film is merely an amusement and it succeeded with that in my eyes.7 out of 10",7.0,Anonymous,History

One of the most beautiful films ever!,"There's nothing else to add, BARRY LYNDON is an absolute masterpiece. We've never seen so beautiful pictures on a screen, and that's really dazzling. By inspiring from the 18th century paintings, Kubrick has resuscitated that time for 3 hours, and we have the impression to really see the 18th century moving in front of us. This is also his most humane work. The evolution of the relationship between Redmund Barry and Lady Lyndon(performed by the sublime Marisa Berenson)and Lord Bullingdon is very well shown, and it moves me a lot.

"Like a fine wine, improves with age....","I tried to watch this movie on video back in 1980, but unfortunately, it failed me.I was 15 years old at the time and had just witnessed Kubrick's wonderful movie ""The Shining"" in the theaters that year.  I quickly became infatuated with Kubrick and quickly searched out his other films to watch.I soon rented ""A Clockwork Orange"" and ""2001"".  I couldn't get enough of this director!  Everything I watched that he created was fantastic and I knew that I would love everything that this man made.  That was until I rented ""Barry Lyndon"" during that same time, and witnessed what I thought was his first triumphant failure....I couldn't get into the movie at all and I distinctly remember not watching the entire thing.  I considered it the cost of a rental thrown down the drain.How young and stupid I was....I tried the film again, sometime around 1993 (13 years later).  I had seen every one of Kubrick's movies by then and loved them all, except this one. I still remembered the experience I had in trying to watch ""Barry Lyndon"". I rented the tape again, to try and watch the film once more.  And am I ever thankful that I did!!It was upon this second viewing (me being older and wiser now and able to understand the messages that Stanley was conveying in his films) that the film made it's wonderful impact on me!I loved every second and frame of this movie:Its slow, deliberate pace to allow the viewer to savor every image, just as one would do with a beautiful photograph or painting,Its beautiful cinematography, for which it won the coveted Oscar for,It's wonderful blend of Irish and classical music,The use of authentic 18th Century costumes (another Oscar winner) and settings,and of course, it's terrific direction by Kubrick to convey the message of man's continued mistreatment of his fellow man in order to gain wealth and power.The last line in this movie says it all!!Along with ""2001"", (IMHO) ""Barry Lyndon"" is Stanley Kubrick's best movie!!

Exquisite cinema,"Having just watched this movie on DVD for the first time in years, I've come away in rapture.Not only is this one of the finest pieces of cinematography ever made, but it is accompanied by beautiful music, sumptuous costumes, subtle lighting and an indefinable something that raises it to the status of art.And as a history nut who often finds himself screaming at the screen ""no, no, no!"", this is a movie where I sat nodding with satisfaction and saying ""yes, yes, yes."" The battle scenes, though brief, are superbly done, conveying a true sense that history is another country, and in this one men marched and fought shoulder to shoulder, loading and firing at preposterously close range with an indifference to death and maiming that we would find unspeakable. But thus it was, and Kubrik does it *properly*, with superb attention to detail, rendering some of the most realistic 18th century battle scenes ever filmed, leaving movies like Waterloo or the Patriot in the dust.There's an elegance and rhythm to this movie that draws you in, intrigues you, and keeps you watching long past bedtime. How often can you watch three hours of movie, then find yourself checking your watch to see if it would be really preposterous to just hit the 'play' button again? Ein Meisterwerk, as one of the ill-fated Lyndon's Prussian officers might have said. And they would have been quite right.",9.0,Anonymous,History
wonderful,"one of the best movies most people will never see. Beautiful. Stunning. A visual treat. Almost too perfect. But it's not a Bourne Conspiracy or a CSI murder mystery.

Even at over three hours in length, I have watched this movie numerous times and each time I see something more exquisite. This takes more than genius to create something of this magnitude. It takes a complete and true artist to be this lavish.. to have an eye for so much detail.

A Work of Art,"Barry Lyndon, perhaps more than any other Stanley Kubrick film, is more of a work of art than a motion picture.  Kubrick was arguably one of the masters of the cinematic art form, however this particular movie is more like an exquisite still painting.  In fact, if you are lucky enough to own the recent digital transfer of this movie, you can freeze-frame any scene of the movie for proof of this--whether it's a great landscape or a more intimate scene of human interaction, the stills are breathtaking.  The story contains a lot of passion, despite Kubrick's trademark stand-offish characterizations.  Ryan O'Neal's performance seems to get better with age (who would have thought that?)  The three hours never drag.  This is definitely one of Kubrick's best, and most underrated, films.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Sadly overlooked Kubrick masterpiece,"I can't believe how underrated this movie is.. for years I didn't watch this movie because I thought it was just a standard ""period film""... but recently I got around to see it and I think this film is a masterpiece.. it totally redefines what a period movie should be for me.. no other film of this kind brought me back in time the way this movie did... Kubrick produced a piece of sheer movie magic with this one and I can't believe how often this film gets overlooked in lists of people's favorite Kubrick films.The cinematography in this film is truly something to behold, it really looked like those great Rembrandt and Vermeer paintings came alive.. plus the dialog, the costumes, the pacing, the beauty of the countryside make this film a feast for the senses.. for nearly 3 hours I felt like I was THERE..I think the reason this film gets overlooked is because Kubrick was known for breaking new ground, which you could say he didn't do with this movie, but I think this should be seen as the definitive period film against which all others should be measured.. movies like 2001, Strangelove, and Clockwork were perhaps more daring and original but Barry Lyndon is not inferior to any of them in terms of craftsmanship.. and I think this one stands out as Kubrick's most emotional and involving film from the human point of view..The dry, ironic narration, the dialog, the visual wonders make this possibly his most entertaining film as well.. how anyone could find this boring I don't understand... there's always something going on, and the beauty is that sometimes Kubrick isn't afraid to linger on visually dazzling shots..In conclusion, if you are one of those ardent Kubrick fans who always skipped this film thinking it's just another ""period piece"" then I advise you to see it now!",10.0,Anonymous,History
Stunning,"Stanley Kubrik's 18th century drama about a young Irish roguewho travels through Europe with various armies during the SevenYears War is a stunning masterpiece that provides scenery andsounds that overwhelm the moviegoers' senses. Redmond Barry,played by Ryan O'Neal, is a tragic character in his youngadulthood who is forced to enlist in the British army, deserts, istaken in by Britain's allies, the Prussians, and through theopportunities afforded to him as a spy for the Prussian armymoves up the social ladder and nearly attains the title of Lord BarryLyndon. However, he cannot fully escape his past and suffers forhis wrong doings. The story is quite compelling despite its longand drawn out format. But what makes the piece so unique andthrilling for the movie enthusiasts is the way it is presented visuallyand musically.The way Kubrik depicts the European landscapes through deepfocus shots and high camera angles is stunning to say the least.The camera captures the unspoiled beauty of picturesquevillages, and the rolling country hills of the European farmlands.Kubrik also displays fantastic shots of palace courtyards thatplace the viewer in the lap of an aristocratic era when luxury andlavishness where at a pinnacle. In addition to the extraordinaryexterior shots are the unique interior shots beyond there time ininnovativeness. Kubrik used a special lens developed by NASA toshoot much of the films interior shots in natural lighting. Thisgives the movie watcher a real sense of being inside of an18thpalace playing cards by candlelight with Patrick Magee'scharacter, the Chevalier de Balibari (http://www.imdb.com/title/ tt0072684/trivia).The other facet of Barry Lyndon that made it so powerful formyself was the use of music, particularly surrounding the LadyLyndon, played by Marisa Berenson. When Lady Lyndon is firstintroduced she is accompanied by a certain score of music thatfits her character remarkably well. The music continues as sheand Barry have their first liaison on a palace porch. As the coupleshared their first kiss there is a dramatic pause in the beat of thesong and their movement seems to almost echo the song as ifthey were performing a dance. As the movie progresses thesame score is repeated at dramatic moments in Lady Lyndon'slife and is playing at the conclusion of the film at a moment whenshe is obviously reflecting on her past with the Irish scoundrel.The combination of visual creativeness and an understanding ofthe power of music are two of Kubrik's trademarks as a director.Visually Barry Lyndon can only be compared to the spectacularouterspace shots of 2001: A Space Odyssey, and musically it ison par with the dramatic scoring of A Clockwork Orange.",10.0,Anonymous,History
An Epic Saga,"I'll just highlight what so many reviewers have already expressed in great detail:BL is an exceptional film. At 3hrs 5 mins; one should be prepared for a long sitting and go into it with no expectations and an open mind. Of course, to be fair, every movie deserves the latter two points.Although a departure, even for Kubrick, it is nevertheless, engrossing. The landscapes are exceptional. And I never comment on costumes, but they really were extraordinary here. Striking in fact. Yet, entirely on point. Designers Ulla-Britt Soderlund and Milena Canonero split the Oscar for Best Costumes back in '76; and I feel certain that even the great 'Edith Head' must have been in awe. They're just that good, beyond ornate.I was (am) not a big Ryan O'Neale fan. But I give him credit here. Stanley must have coached him (as he so often does with actors.)I was 21 when this was released. Just loved the ladies in this movie. Something about their propriety within their improper behavior. It is this display that appears to bother so many reviewers.And even though it's just a movie, this goes on today, and has been on a large scale since time immemorable.But again; it gets back to the genius, Stanley Kubrick. It shouldn't be a stretch for anybody to estimate what a bore this flick would've been had it been attempted by anybody else (with the exception of Frank Darabont.)Not one of my favorite Kubrick entries, it is nevertheless a grand film whose production was executed with elegance & class, from start to finish, like no other of its kind.Personally, I think ""A Clockwork Orange"" is a masterpiece.

Kubrick's perfect portrait of Lyndon's rise and fall,"`Barry Lyndon' is a delight for the eyes and the ears: the XVIII century landscapes are exquisite in their colors and light; the indoor sets, with perfect decoration and costume design, are marvelous to the minutest nuances; and the music, from Bach to Schubert, is sublime. But what is most impressive in Kubrick's movie is his capacity to convey melancholy and inexorability to portray the tragic story of Thackeray's anti-hero Barry Lyndon, a gifted but poor Irishman who will impersonate different roles, crossing several countries and facing continuous disenchantment, only to meet his gloomy fate in the end. The deliberate subdued acting, the narrator's subtle irony and detachment, Ryan O'Neal's sad eyes and impassive face and, most of all, the slowpacing of both editing and acting, all converge to provide a sense of grief and doom that mark this masterpiece. Kubrick's genius can be better observed by the way he conceives of and stages the three duels that are the turning points of the story. `Barry Lyndon' is the ultimate example of how a movie with a conventional, linear narrative can be brilliant in its own way (9/10).",9.0,Anonymous,History

Both in- and outdoor stages are remarkable and of equal quality: perfect. My ""problem"" with Barry Lyndon is neither with actors (they are all so authentic), nor with its narrative parts as literature. No ! My ""problem"" is about perfection (and the recurrent Sarabande by Händel as herald change in every appointment with death). Perfection during 3 hours makes me feel dizzy at the end.

With my kindest regards,"Barry Lyndon is one of the greatest films of all time to me and sometimes it makes me think that is it the greatest movie ever made? When the film ended, I was so upset, I never had felt like that in another movie as I remember. It is not surprising that for some people, it is extremely dull and too long. Yes, it is not for the people who prefer fast paced movies or movies with fast editing. This is the fact that unconventional films are not appreciated mostly. As known, Kubrick was a perfectionist director, so he made perfect films, but Barry Lyndon is the best Kubrick movie to me. Honestly, I seriously got bored while watching The Killer's Kiss that is only 67 minutes! but did not get bored while watching Barry Lyndon even one second. When I saw the lettering ''Intermission'', I felt like no need for a break. The film is probably the most still, flowing, beautiful, artistic, reposeful and kindest film ever made and it is pure cinema. The way of story telling is very elegant, kind in every scene. The background music and narration make the movie much more mesmerizing. The coherence among the music, the narration and the content is great. And I want to say that the most magical narration is here The duel scene between Barry Lyndon and his stepson. Probably the longest duel in the history of cinema. This scene is my favorite scene of the movie, I would put it in the cinema anthology. I have never seen such a duel in my life. The foxy music warns us, something sad will happen. Tension gets higher, higher and higher. It is a mix of perfectionism, quintessential cinema and art. Barry Lyndon is not a good person as he is not evil. He entices Lady London, it is a liaison. Besides, later he makes something deadly. Although, he is guilty, he gets angry when Lady London's husband lectures him and so on. I try to mean that Barry Lyndon is a deep character study. As for its rating (once upon a time, one day it was in the list, the other day it was not.) it is a huge question mark.",10.0,Anonymous,History
"Beautiful to the Eyes, Painful to the Senses","Okay, I will admit that I saw this film only once, about 30 years ago. I had totally loved ""A Clockwork Orange,"" and couldn't wait to see Kubrick's latest. I was an English teacher at the time, and I recall one of my students telling me that her dad had seen the movie, and thought it was just about the most beautiful movie he'd ever seen. That really whet my appetite to see it even more.As it turns out, her dad wasn't wrong, exactly. ""Barry Lyndon"" as seen on the big screen is sumptuous. Scenes could be frozen and committed to canvas as works of art. The cinematography was grand.The story, less so. The plot was so forgettable, at least as presented in this movie, that I can scarcely remember any of it. I do recall one long, long protracted scene of Ryan O'Neal and Marissa Berenson (I think) riding in a carriage. He was smoking a pipe, or cigar, or whatever. They sat silently while riding, as he smoked and she periodically waved away his smoke with an annoyed, gloved hand (that's how I remember it anyway). The scene seemed to go on for a good 5 minutes, although it was probably just a minute or so that FELT like 5. I wanted to jump out of my skin. Honestly, I have a vague memory of having left the theater at intermission. I'm not completely sure that I did, it was so long ago. But if I did, it was the first and last time. I can tolerate boring movies. I am very, very difficult to offend. I can tolerate stupid, pointless movies. But ""Barry Lyndon"" seemed to be in another category altogether. I couldn't relate to anyone in the movie, least of all Ryan O'Neal's portrayal. At that time, he seemed to me to be, as an actor, completely without substance. Maybe Kubrick chose him exactly for that quality. I don't know.To be fair, maybe if I watched this movie again in the present, I would like it and appreciate it. But I doubt it.I give the movie a 3 out of 10 because of the beautiful cinematography, nothing more.",3.0,Anonymous,History
Possibly filmdom's most unique period epic.,"When I was a film maker, I learned a very sad lesson. When it comes to audience approval, a monumentally great film can fail in the box office if viewers come to it with preconceived expectations that are wrong. MGM hyped David Lean's magnificent ""Ryan's Daughter"" as another ""Doctor Zhivago"". It was nothing of the kind. If you attended a screening of that show with this in mind, you would very likely be confused and disappointed by the radically different sort of picture it is. In the case of ""Barry Lyndon"", that process worked in reverse for me. I missed seeing it when it was first released. I heard many negative reviews and comments suggesting that it was a slack, slow failure. ""Kubrick had bombed at last!"" Years later, I finally caught up with it and saw it, pretty much to satisfy my curiosity about this major failure from a major director. I was thunderstruck to discover that it seemed instead to be the greatest film Kubrick made. I know that the controversy rages on and many agree with me, while many do not. I will say that, although I hardly expect to win over ""Barry Lyndon""s detractors, I think that it will stand the test of time far better than say, ""2001, a Space Odyssey"" which, although it must be lauded as a legendary ground-breaker in its day, does not play nearly as well today. For me, ""2001"" simply does not reward repeated viewing anywhere near as richly as ""Barry Lyndon"". If you haven't seen this one, see it only on a giant screen, giving it your undivided attention. Judge it for yourself. It is too unique and amazing to be missed.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Stands alone as an *emotional* story amongst Kubrick's work,"Kubrick is a director I more admire than like. His films are often Chinese puzzle boxes. Beautiful, finely detailed, stately but hard to open, sterile. His films rarely, if ever, invoke specific guttural feelings. 2001: A Space Odyssey for example inspires the mood of being in awe and not the specific joys of flying. The one exception is this film-it does repeatedly invoke strong gut emotions, especially fear, dread and grief.This film has a strange alchemy to it. It is Kubrick at his most stately and grand. The compositions are deeply mathematical and geometrical. A lot of shots are consciously modelled on paintings of Gainsborough, Vermeer etc. The natural lighting, cinematography are utterly breathtaking. But such visual splendor is at odds with the ugliness of the characters and their world.The narrative is centered on the vulgarities of happenstance, luck. The story developments whiplash between good fortune and ruin. I.e. Barry feeling liberation at leaving his home is followed immediately by him feeling the destitution induced by footpads. The central images of the film-gambling, dueling-are stark expressions of this. You either get a lucky break or you die. This juxtaposition of the grandeur of setting and the squalor of the characters make everything feel more acute.The film finding human equity in the grave is perhaps the best expression of Kubrick's themes of man's inhumanity to man.",10.0,Anonymous,History
one of the best movies ever made,"This is simply one of the best movies ever made.Unfortunately, it is too refined to ever make it into the IMDb Top-250, I fear.The qualities of this film are well described in some other comments. A marvelous story, based on a great novel. Somewhat too slow for some people. Psychological depth, even though the main character (you can't call him ""hero"")is rather despicable. A beautiful picture of 18th century society and morals, underlined by beautiful 18th century music. Great acting. Splendid photography.

Don't waste your time.,"One thing that has always impressed me about Stanley Kubrick's films is the strong characters in each. In every movie of his that I've seen, there has always been one character that I feel a strong liking for, whether he is Jack in ""The Shining"" or Alex in ""A Clockwork Orange"", or even HAL in ""2001: A Space Odyssey"". However, this film is the exception to the rule.The main character, promising Redmond Barry, eventually degenerates into the pomposity of high society, putting his wealthy wife into debt in order to gain lordship under the advice of his once-good mother. At best, the film's plot is a warning against the evils of wealth. At it's very worst, it is a poor choice of novels for Mr. Kubrick to adapt onto the screen. The characters are static and boring, the plot disappointing, and the actors pitiful.Forget the so-called subtlety of Ryan O'Neal. Forget the cinematic power that Stanley Kubrick holds over his fans. This film is not worth your time. It is too long, with too many plot points, for not enough reward at the end. The only reason why I even bothered to finish the movie was because I was waiting for the typical Kubrick edginess to come in and rescue the film the boring path it was leading me down. That edginess never came.With no strong hero, and no strong villain, none of the characters spark enough interest in it's viewers to get them emotionally wrapped in the movie. A complete waste of two and a half hours.",2.0,Anonymous,History
One of my all-time favorites.,"Following the remarkable and often puzzling life of a headstrong young Irishman, Kubrick creates resonant moments on the way to a nihilistic conclusion.  Redmond Barry saw many aspects of life in his time, but his experience is ultimately pointless, as the shattering epilogue reminds us. The Oscar-winning costumes are original antiques, and every frame is composed beautifully.  A challenging film, it is Kubrick's forgotten masterpiece.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Poetry/Art in Motion,This just might be my favorite film by Mr. Kubrick. While not his most 'universal' it is his most delicately beatiful film.

Abundant scenes of beauty take you to the period the film depicts. Bravo Mr. Kubrick!!!,10.0,Anonymous,History
A movie with an astonishing beauty who suffers from it's oblivion,"Barry Lyndon is part of the movies that, thought their interesting matter, have difficulty to get a place in cinema memory. But it constitutes a gorgeous piece of art and a major work by Stanley Kubrick as all other movies by the director. Despite a much less artistic print than other Kubrick's work, it's incredible beauty provided by the scenario and the magnificent shots reflects the professionalism of the direction and all the departments of the production.The most remarkable side of the picture is the beauty of the shots and the rich colors that constitutes the film itself. Technically, Barry Lyndon is a masterpiece by the quality of the image. To make the film, Stanley Kubrick took old cameras from the BBC and adapted the objectives to get that astonishing shots. With their unique conception, the cameras have the particularity to flatten the image to give the impression of viewing a painting. With the great quality of the costumes, it makes the movie wonderful from end to end.The work of William Makepeace Thackeray is also part of the beauty of the movie, it makes reflect without making morality, it is built with a great conscience of society and, despite the fact that the book was written in 1844, it is still possible to associate the tale in our time. The story is well adapted and divided, scenes are wonderfully directed so the movie is interesting at all, even if it lasts 3 hours.Sadly, Barry Lyndon suffers from the other much powerful movies by Stanley Kubrick, but it is still a great masterpiece to discover.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Brilliant photography/costumes make long story delightful,"Most fans of the director agree that ""Barry Lyndon"" is a departure from other Stanley Kubrick films, yet the master's signature can be seen throughout this brilliantly photographed gem. Admittedly long, ""Barry Lyndon"" is never boring. Many of the scenes are drawn out not by action or dialog, but by the consumption of the breathtakingly beautiful countryside, appearing at times ""computer-enhanced"", as the human eye is not accustomed to so much visual delight.The story of a young Irishman (played by a dashing Ryan O'Neil) of middle class standing, who has aspirations to ""marry well"". Handsome and well-spoken, the young Barry is still self-absorbed and in many ways stubborn and determined. Through trickery and scheming, he marries a rich Noblewoman (portrayed by Marisa Berensen), but quickly shows his true colors as shameless playboy. Abusive to his step-son, even plotting to assure his wife's fortune to be waved into his own pockets, Barry eventually alienates himself from all acquaintances. The final ""fate"" with which he meets (after 3 hours of viewing) is sure to deliver ""satisfaction"" to the audience.Kubrick's script received a nomination, but not the actual Oscar. Statuettes did go to the outstanding Cinematography, Costume Design, Set Design and Art Direction. Look for a deliciously fitting Epilogue in the final frame! Among the period dramas of old King George's Day, Barry Lyndon has a special place.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Fiction of Kubrick,"Before watching the movie, i knew that the director is ""Stanley Kubrick"". When I heard that name, I'm sure, a wacky scenario waits me. Whatever you look for is in this movie. Drama, thriller, crime, war, adventure, romance...etc. A boring camera viewpoint never used. Also; if when you are watching a movie, you put yourself in place of the man in the head role, than misfortunes will disrupt your nerves and upset you. This is a very positive recommendation. Scenario and fiction can be unreasonable but they are not unusual or impossible. In this way, I always focused on movie. I would recommend. Go to the Future of the Past.

"Majestuous, epic, fully Kubrickian","""Barry Lyndon"" isn't as much a film as it is visual poetry. Generally I don't enjoy a ""style over substance"" approach to filmmaking, but ""Barry Lyndon"" is a movie that really shows what a genius Stanley Kubrick was. William Makepeace Thackeray's novel really isn't that fantastic, to me by far the weakest story Kubrick has ever adapted. But the imagery he gets out of it, all the shots that look like Renaissance paintings, the utter coldness (nobody has emotions until the last hour) with which he tells the story makes this a true classic. And then there's the other Kubrick trademark I adore: keeping the pace as low as possible without ever getting boring. The duels for instance take ages, but that's mainly because we're dealing with someone who knows what suspense is. Who minds that it takes the duelists roughly half an hour to cock a pistol, Kubrick knows he can take as long as he likes because you always want to know what happens next. The only thing that's kind of shame is that the studio forced him to hire Ryan O'Neal, who is wrong for the character and robs the movie of some of its incredible charm. If this had a better lead, it may have been the best film (Kubrick has) ever made.",9.0,Anonymous,History
The first critics had it right,"Barry Lyndon was slated by critics on release, kind of forgotten, but in recent years has been reappraised by many as one of Kubrick's great films. I side with the original critics. This is pretty to look at and also pretty pointless. The most glaring flaw is lightweight Ryan O'Neal in the lead role. He's a cipher impossible to care about, kind of a rogue but not an outright villain. The story proceeds as one would expect, there are slight satirical touches but nothing too biting, then it ends. It never gave me a reason to care. No idea what attracted Kubrick to the story or what he wanted to say with this. A large miss.",5.0,Anonymous,History
Kbrick the candle light.,"There are films that, when watching, the spectator wants to do the same, that is, to make a film. There are others who, on the contrary, inhibit and discourage. In this second category, feature films by director Stanley Kubrick, such as ""Barry Lyndon"", are usually included. They are ambitious undertakings on the intellectual side and enormous for the material.Here, the story of the adventures of the rogue Barry Lyndon is accompanied by the audacious use of the steady cam, following the advance of an army with the camera along an uneven terrain and without shaking. Even more spectacular is the use of special lenses so that the film could be lit by candlelight. More spectacular or more mannerist? In any case, Stanley Kubrick sometimes distances us a little from his object, as if art were interposed between him and us.",10.0,Anonymous,History
This is a fantastic film,"For years I had deliberately avoided this film, the thought of Ryan O'Neal with a clunky Irish accent and bad period acting had scarred me away but what a delight it was when I finally bit the bullet and watched it.Firstly I normally hate to watch period pieces particularly those adapted from English literature of the time, the unrealistic characters and sentimental plots make my skin crawl. But here we have the story of Redmond Barry lovable(?) Irish rogue and his adventures through Europe. The acting is superb throughout, O'Neal even pulls off a believable enough accent and is well cast as titular character, portraying his initial naivety and ultimate world-weariness with aplomb. As with all Kubrick films it is beautifully shot, the period setting allowing sumptuous costumes, scenery and backdrops. Each scene looks like an oil painting, add to this a fantastic selection of classical pieces for the movie's score and you have a feast for your ears and eyes.

Everyone of his themes,from man's dehumanization by systematized means to the threat of complete annhilation are here. It's worth a second look and greater appreciation.

Kubrick's painterly odyssey,"The hallmark of a Stanley Kubrick film has always been the ability to transport the viewer to a uniquely rendered cinematic world of meticulously crafted detail and thought provoking themes. Moreover, Kubrick continually creates a new visual language with which to communicate in very uniquely appropriate terms.  Certainly this is true with ""Barry Lyndon."" Kubrick's painterly odyssey of 18th century European society is presented on an epic canvas. What makes it unique and ultimately haunting is how Kubrick views his subjects literally as figures in an artist's landscape ""trapped"" within a pre-determined frame. The tableau unfolds continually in scene after scene that begins with a close-up and slowly pulls back to reveal the ""big picture"" all the while an ironic narrator tells of their upcoming fates. Kubrick's compositions are evocative of the era paintings of Hogarth, Gainsborough and Watteau rendered on film with real candlelit interiors as opposed to artifical movie lighting.This elegiac portrait of the transience of time is a uniquely poetic piece of cinematic art.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Truly a must-see masterpiece,"Rather different from any other Kubrick piece...Barry Lyndon still reeks of Kubrick direction (it's a good thing of course). Each scene is beautifully crafted, and each frame of the film could be used as a painting in an art museum. I don't think there's a more picturesque film out there than this one - though A Clockwork Orange would be a close second. The witty third person narrative was a great touch...never detracts from the story even though he tells you what happens beforehand. Barry, like Alex in ACO, is a despicable character, but you can't help but identify and sympathize when the situation calls for it. In the 3+ hour run time (though it never feels as long) - you feel every different emotion for Barry that Kubrick/Thackeray intended. In one scene you'll be apologetic, in the next you'll be outraged. Ryan O'Neal and Leon Vitali both give excellent performances, and the rest of the cast does an amiable job as well.It's not a film for everyone, as it takes it's time unfolding the story (as many Kubrick films do), and yes, it is rather long...but if viewed for nothing more than the beauty of it, itself, this masterpiece should be seen at least once by anyone who considers themselves a lover of film. One of Stanley Kubrick's finest, a technical achievement in itself, and a masterpiece of period films.9 out of 10.",10.0,Anonymous,History

At 3hrs 5 mins its intimidating and period pieces, not my thing. Wigs and bayonets I tend to avoid. Its not an all-star cast, other than Ryan O'Neal I didn't know anyone else. Were these just excuses? Definitely!Believe my header, this movie does not feel long at all, in fact when it ends you'll be surprised it ended because Kubrick held you in his grasp the whole time. Ryan O'Neal's ""Barry Lyndon"" an opportunist in every sense of the word but his story and adventure, the dream of every common man or woman, to succeed in life is relatable to us all. Its touching and tragic but its hypnotic to watch. Obviously the costumes and design top marks, like everyone says its truly paintings come to life. But the acting is solid and the script truly is never dull. Will you like it, who's to say? But if you enjoy Kubrick's films trust me you'll like this one, his trademarks are all there.

A Truly Beautiful Film.,"This is probably the most beautiful piece of film making that I think I have ever seen, I can see where Ridley Scott got his inspiration for his equally visually stunning film ""the Duelists"". Every shot does look like an 18th Century Gainsborough oil painting as noted in the description.I remember seeing a small potion of this Movie when I was quite young and thinking how nice it looked even back then. When I came across it again I was initially put off a little at the three hour run time but when the final credits ran I was left wishing for more?. Its sad to reflect that films such as these are simply not made anymore and probably never will be again. The pacing of the film is far too slow for the Social Media stimulus junkie generation that need constant action to maintain their Goldfish like attention spans and the Historical authenticity of the film would be wrecked by the current politics of inclusion over any semblance of actual Historical reality but at least we will always have this masterpiece as a high water mark of Western Cinema before the current rot set in.",10.0,Anonymous,History

You'll like this WAY more than you think you will!,"This was a very pleasant surprise ngl. I didn't think I would like this as much as I did, I thought it would be another 8/10 average Kubrick movie that didn't quite live up to my expectations like Paths of Glory and Dr. Strangelove. But this really was great. The first hour or so was kind of slow for me and I wasn't really into it as much. But soon after that I was completely hooked (and I'm surprised about it as well). Something like this shouldn't have had my undivided attention, but it managed it. I was fully invested, and almost felt like I had traveled back to the late 1700s. The production design was fantastic and captured the vibe perfectly; it's almost as if the movie was truly 250 years old. But damn. The cinematography. Every shot was truly like a painting. Some of the best in any movie I think, probably top 20-30 ever. Bulls*** Oscar snub. One of the most visually stunning movies out there, especially for 1975. This is Kubrick's 4th best movie imo, but the 3 above it are virtually untouchable (ACO, 2001, and Shining). Honestly tho, the story in this film had me completely hooked, and the ending was as intense as ever. One of my only complaints however was that the pacing wasn't too good. Every time it'd felt like an hour I would check how far I was into the movie only to realize that 25 minutes had passed. There were moments that it was a little boring, but sometimes you need that in a movie.

A fantastic invocation of the 18th century.,"Barry Lyndon may be one of the least popular of all of Stanley Kubrick's films, but it is by no means deserving of this reputation. This historical epic explores an era in Europe that is often overshadowed in America by the events of the so called French and Indian War (which was in all actuality an extension of the seven years war that is portrayed in the film) and the subsequent American Revolution. Although it follows the life of one man it touches on many issues that were highly relevant in those days, especially the very Candide- like way that Barry finds himself in a military career. Overall the film goes a great distance to evoke the feel of the late 18th century and archives this end spectacularly.The term ""Costume Epic"" finds in this film perhaps its most astounding fulfillment. Indeed, one of Barry Lyndon's most notable features is the extensive and beautiful costuming. Not only are the styles and make-up of the period represented, but there is a lovely treatment of the military uniforms and equipment used during the Seven Years War.The stunning cinematography, and of course the famously candlelit scenes, deserve mention. The locations used in the film are stunning to say the least, with broad country vistas and rich noble villas presented in a style reminiscent of painters of the 18th and 19th centuries. The candlelit scenes are both technically and visually impressive, and go a long way towards capturing the feel of the period.The story itself oftentimes seems secondary to the visual splendor of the film, but is of good quality in and of itself. It is not tremendously innovative, as many other Kubrick films are, in terms of content, but the story is told well. Narration is put to excellent effect, giving the whole film the book-like feel that can be found quite often in Kubrick's films.Overall, though it is easy to overlook as a part of his career, Barry Lyndon deserves a place among the most notable of Kubrick's achievements, right along with films like A Clockwork Orange and Full Metal Jacket, if only for its invocation of its temporal setting alone.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Visually stunning,"Kubrick and Alcott create images unparalleled in terrestrial cinema. Only Scott's space-scapes (Alien; Aliens) come close to capturing a similar evocative sense of reality on celluloid. Even Ryan O'Neill seems believable in the context of the sets/images captured in this visual wonder. I am a confirmed and unapologetic Kubrick addict. But this for me is one of the best; it requires very little effort to achieve the ""willing suspension of disbelief"" which is a traditional hallmark of film success. In particular, pay attention to the interiors, especially scenes lit by lamp/candle. The play of shadow and texture of structure like stone and wood building materials creates truly transporting ""Reality"".",9.0,Anonymous,History
Second Best of '75,"Second only to Jaws, Barry Lyndon is the story of an Irish rogue who's determined to get to the top of the social ladder any way he can. He'll lie, cheat, steal, and kill, but he always has time for women. A movie like this seems like it would be for anyone, but the 18th century setting and the three hour running time seem to put everyone off.Well, I'm here to tell you that it's not the movie you think it would be. The poster, which is one of my all time favorites, sums the film up brilliantly. Fighting and loving is what a man does best and that's what life seems to always end up being.Barry Lyndon is Kubrick's greatest film. The Art-Direction and Costumes are spectacular and they both deservedly won Oscars. The director captures that era brilliantly and does it with what seems like such ease. The battlefields are perfect and the everything is done for a reason. Kubrick even waited until the clouds in the sky were just how he wanted them before he started shooting a scene.And it never gets slow at all. Despite the long running time, it will always interest you to find out what Barry will try to do next. Which means that Kubrick has directed it in such a way that it's not like most other long films.The acting by Ryan O'Neal is the best of that year. It's a shame that he wasn't recognized by the Academy for a nomination. He truly deserved one, and not without the help of Kubrick.Stanley Kubrick deserved his long overdue Best Director award that year for the time and effort he put in to creating this masterpiece. It also won Oscars for Cinematography and Adaptation Score. It's one of the best films of the '70s and one of the best films of all time. It's also definitely the best thing Kubrick has ever done.",10.0,Anonymous,History
10/10,"I don't use the m-word very often, but this is a masterpiece - a remarkable achievement on multiple levels that deserves mention among the best films of its decade. It's been a long time since I've been so excited about a movie - let alone a nearly 50 year old, three hour plus costume drama. But every part of my being wants to grab a thesaurus to come up with new and interesting adjectives to describe this motion picture. Before I start the hosannas, let me broach the subject of Ryan O'Neal. I began the movie feeling like he was terribly miscast; however, as time went on, I think he was an ideal choice for the role. Frankly, O'Neal is a stunningly handsome but rather vapid actor who doesn't convey much intelligence or dimension. And this actually turns out to be perfect for the titular character. It's rather fascinating - he is someone who would normally elicit feelings of contempt and loathsomeness, but I didn't feel negativity toward him at all, despite his obvious superficiality. The production values are sumptuous, from the cinematography to the art direction to the music and costumes - these are monumental achievements that still seem ravishing. But most importantly, this is one of the great examples I've seen recently of good old-fashioned story telling. This has got to be one of the great book to screen adaptations ever. I usually hate narration in a movie, but Michael Hordern's achievement here is unforgettable and imperative to the movie's success. I normally run away screaming from any movie over the 180 minute mark, but time flew by here and I never looked at the clock once. Every few years, I re-evaluate my list of favorite movies - this may cause me to make a change or two. - Jeff Marshall, Movie Blogger (Facebook)",10.0,Anonymous,History
"Scandals, intrigues, and passion: Barry Lyndon unveils the secrets of 18th-century aristocracy!","Barry Lyndon, an timeless masterpiece of Kubrick's cinema, stands as a monument of cinematography, transporting the viewer through the intricate events of a man in a golden age. Enchanting with unparalleled technical mastery, Kubrick delves into the very fabric of the human soul, revealing the frailties, desires, and ambitions that drive the actions of every individual. At the heart of the narrative is Barry Lyndon, a character who, with his complexity and humanity, emerges as an icon of a tumultuous era. His quest for status and power propels him on a journey through 18th-century aristocratic society, where love, deceit, and tragedy intertwine in a complex web of destinies. Kubrick's visual mastery is evident in every frame, with photography that captures the essence of the Georgian era. The sumptuous rural landscapes and opulent aristocratic residences become true characters, providing a vibrant and detail-rich backdrop to Barry's story. Each scene is a carefully painted canvas, transporting the viewer to a distant yet remarkably alive era. But it is in the analysis of the characters that Barry Lyndon truly distinguishes itself. Every figure, even the most marginal, is painted with surprising psychological depth. Barry himself is an ambiguous protagonist, whose struggle for social ascent is punctuated by triumphs and tragedies. The characters surrounding him are equally complex, each with their own desires and ambitions, intertwining in an intricate game of power and deceit. The carefully selected soundtrack by Kubrick completes the cinematic experience, adding another layer of emotion and meaning. The sweet and melancholic melodies blend perfectly with the images, creating an enveloping atmosphere that captivates the viewer from beginning to end. Ultimately, Barry Lyndon is much more than a mere historical film. It is a work of art that exudes depth and meaning, inviting the viewer to reflect on the very nature of humanity. With its engaging narrative, technical mastery, and unparalleled character analysis, this Kubrick masterpiece will remain in the hearts of viewers for generations to come, continuing to enchant and inspire with its timeless vision of the world and the human soul.",10.0,Anonymous,History
"A lady who sets her heart upon a lad in uniform must prepare to change lovers pretty quickly, or her life will be but a sad one.","First thing that is patently obvious is that as a visual piece of work the film has few peers, from stunning shots of rolling hills to the lavish period detail, it quite literally is breath taking. The attention to detail by director Stanley Kubrick and cinematographer John Alcott is admirable, whilst the costumes are of the highest order. I have never read the novel by William Makepeace Thackeray so have no frame of reference as regards the portrayals we witness unfolding. I have read that many find the film lacking in the humorous wit that is rife in Thackeray's page turner, yet Kubrick's take is full of satire surrounding the social standing that is the core beat of the story - well it certainly had me smiling anyways.The film is pretty downbeat, thus, for a three hour movie it can bog down many a viewers patience. Which puts this into the movie for mood scenario bracket - because I personally wouldn't want to watch it if I was having a particularly blue day, so that is something newcomers to the film might want to bear in mind. There seems to be much division as regards Ryan O'Neal's performance in the film, and again having not read the novel I couldn't tell you if he nailed it. What I do know is that he seems perfect for the tone of the movie, and that really shouldn't be seen as a negative in my opinion. My only gripe really with it is that as a story it really doesn't engage me, I really didn't care about what happened to our title character or the assorted people close in his rapidly annoying world. Is that Kubrick's fault? Well he did his job with much style, the story just doesn't warrant a three hour epic, even when it's dressed up as splendidly as this most assuredly is. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,History
The Emperor has no clothes,"Roger Ebert gave this movie 4/4 but I'm going to quote from his review.""emotionally distant""""aggressive in its cool detachment""""because Kubrick has directed Ryan O'Neal in the title role as if he were a still life""""ultimately inconsequential story""""there is no there there""""forcing our detachment""I'd argue all that adds up top ""this film sucks but I'm going to declare it genius because because Kubrick is an artiste!"".Some people see piss in a bottle and think ""that's piss in a bottle"".

Instead of just making everything look beautiful, every scene is intended to be some sort of a living painting. The film invites you to step into Barry Lyndon's shoes and takes you on a moralistic journey through his life. The action really gets interesting in the second half after Barry gets his name. So much of the film is perfectly framed for its spot in the movie, including the title sequence.

One of the greatest movies ever made.  Beautiful Cinematography,"Barry Lyndon is at once the most under-appreciated Kubrick movie, and possibly Kubrick's greatest crowning achievement. The reason it is under-appreciated actually stem from its pacing probably more than the fact that it's derided as a period piece (because if you see the movie, full of sex, gambling, war, awesome duels (and some of the best duel scenes/suspense scenes Kubrick's ever shot)......The pace of this movie is it's only flaw, but the pace actually is something that helps bring the viewer into the movie upon further viewings.....it is probably the only movie that really feels more like a book, as Kubrick spares no time expense in developing these characters, and after each viewing the viewer will sense the effect of Kubrick at his peak.This is not a movie to watch when you want to see a ""Shining"" or ""Full Metal Jacket"" type of action.....Barry Lyndon is a very detailed period story featuring all the peaks and setting pace of a book. This is a perfect movie to have an intermission with, to help you regroup and be engrossed in the story. THe dramatic highs (Jonathan Quinn duel, War, Gambling, Fight, and later duels) feature some of the finest work (Acting, camera work, directing) ever put on film. This movie took me 2 viewings or so to get, and I've seen it maybe 5-6 times now, and I can tell you, Barry Lyndon quickly moved up to the top of my movie list. It's a must see (at least twice). The acting is phenomenal, the movie is a labor of love, the cinematography is beautiful, the sets/lighting is amazing. It's hard to believe this movie is 30+ yrs old and is virtually unknown except to the Kubrick faithful. This is a MUST SEE!Overall, I'd rank Kubrick Movies as follows (I've yet to see Spartacus and a couple early ones and I'm not counting A.I.).1) Barry Lyndon: 10/10 2) Paths of Glory: 10/10 (pretty much a tie with #1) 3) Shining 10/10: I love this one, even if it's a bit more derided 4) Full Metal Jacket 10/10. NOT a feel good movie, but a great one nonetheless 5) Eyes Wide Shut: 9/10. Creepy and underrated. Acting was GREAT! 6) Lolita: 9/10....I like this more and more each time, it's moved up. 7) A Clockwork Orange: 8/10. Disturbing, well acted, a bit too over the top and the rape scenes are a bit too much (and it's a bit long). 8) 2001: A Space Odyssey. 8/10. I saw this in a theater 2 years ago and loved it, but it's pace makes it tough to watch at home, so I marked it down a bit. 9) The Killing: 8/10. Very Good and pretty much forgotten but worth seeing. 10) Dr. Strangelove. The only Kubrick movie to date I've watched multiple times and not really understood the hype. It's reasonably funny, but has nothing on Lolita or Clockwork for humour. 6/10.",10.0,Anonymous,History

A Hidden Gem from Kubrick,"It is a shame that Kubrick is only remembered for Eyes Wide Shut, A Clockwork Orange and the Shining to name a few. While more 'die hard' film fans will be more aware of his other films, Barry Lyndon is a fantastic film.From what I know, it is relatively historically accurate. I am not going to be pedantic and study every last detail and then announce 'wait a minute, in the 18th Century a soldier would not have been awarded that medal' because that is not the point. The basics are right, and that is all that is needed. The way in which the armies march forward in lines is entirely correct, and how while individual men are shot down, the rest stay in perfect formation. The battle scenes are certainly a highlight. Purely because of the vivid costumes and the scale, Kubrick really makes a spectacle.The decadence of the society that Lyndon has been able to become a part of is also really emphasised the the costumes, the film won various awards for the quality of the costumes in 1975. The elaborate dresses worn by the women to the tail coats of the men are all so finely detailed, there is always something to be in awe of.The acting is also as good as the costumes. Michael Hordern is flawless in his role as the narrator. Which is a good thing too - considering that the film is well over three hours in length! Horderns clear, yet powerful voice keeps you on the ball with the plot if you struggle with films that are any longer than two hours. Ryan O'Neal, despite being American does not struggle to put on the rugged Irish accent of Barry Lyndon, making the film even more believable.This is truly a marvellous historical drama. Don't expect battle scenes that are comparable to the scenes in Zulu, but watching a film from this period was a breath of fresh air considering that nearly all war films in the seventies and eighties were based on Vietnam!",8.0,Anonymous,History
Worst cosplay ever..,"While photographically perfect, everything else is just so irritatingly fake, how can anyone lavish praise on this, is beyond me.
'Irish rogue' he is supposed to portray, but O'Neal with his irritating yankee voice doesn't even try to act, he just stands around looking doe-eyed and dumb.
Not to mention the background 'music'. Guess the budget ran out, but silence is better than the endless monotony of two geeks listlessly torturing a recorder. My poor ears..

Tale of a Self Centred Ambitious Adventurer,"'Barry Lyndon' has been said to be a different kind of Kubrick film. While most of his works obviously touch on dark themes and have a distinct atmosphere (mostly one that evokes claustrophobia), Kubrick takes a slightly different path with this film. That is not to say that 'Barry Lyndon' is a lighthearted comedy but more of a dark coming of age comedy.The second half is much darker than the first. It starts off as an epic fairy tale/fable and then, just like any journey, leads to various discoveries with reactions and consequences. Kubrick takes his time in telling us the story but his trick is the moments between the conversation. While the dialogue and narration move the story forward it is the quieter sequences and the pauses that reveal the shades of the characters. Similarly his intricate use of humour adds to the compelling storytelling and the epilogue rounds it up hilariously.The dazzling visuals (additional thanks to the stunning work of the art department and costume and John Alcott's cinematography) make this an enriching experience. A lot of attention has been given to detail and it shows. The splendid score gives it a touch of satire.Ryan O'Neal is terrific as the flawed lead who is a sensation seeking adventurer acting on his instinct without thinking of consequences. Marisa Berenson is very good in her restrained performance. Mary Kean does a fine job as the mother. The rest of the cast perform adequately.In my opinion, every one of Kubrick's films are worth viewing and so 'Barry Lyndon' is no exception even though it's stylistically and thematically very different from his signature.",,Anonymous,History
A perfect film,"A magnificent film, Barry Lyndon is pretty much a perfect overview of the 18th century European world, from the perspective of our protagonist, Redmond Barry. I consider Kubrick as one of my favorite directors (if I would be forced to rank him I would place him second on my list). Stunningly beautiful, in both visual and audial senses, its a movie to slowly contemplate. Indeed, Roger Ebert choose this film as one of his top 10 film of all time in 2012 for the Sign and Sound pool. It was a worthy choice as this film is perfect.The cinematography is beyond perfect. Kubrick planned to make each frame of this film look as much as possible as an 18th century paintings and indeed, each frame can be hanged over the wall. The film's score is also amazing, featuring a combination of 18th century classical music and more modern compositions. The score fits the film perfectly.The pacing is quite slow,, specially if compared to recent films, even in the 1970′s it was considered slow paced, however. But the pacing is relative because the film takes its time and the slower pacing doesn't hurt the experience of seeing the film, it improves it.",9.0,Anonymous,History

Trying to find your place in the world,"Best thought of as a film about uncertainty in life, this engrossing Stanley Kubrick drama chronicles the ups and down of an eighteenth century man whose fortunes constantly changes. Growing up, 'Barry Lyndon' was never one of my favourite Kubrick films; after all, the uncharismatic title character never changes very much and lacks personality. The narration also tends to reveal key events too early on for them to retain an emotional punch. A recent rewatch of 'Barry Lyndon' with 'A Clockwork Orange' fresh in mind was a revelation though. While one is set in the past and the other is set in the future, the two movies actually have a lot in common as they deal with young men trying to find their place in cruel and unfair worlds. Barry's breaking down into tears when unsure whether to spy on the Chevalier is reminiscent of Alex being kicked out of his parents' home with the same uncertainty of where to go and what to do, having been displaced from a once-familiar life. Emotionless as he sometimes seems, Barry makes for a highly sympathetic character too. Early in the piece is labeled as ""but a boy and does not signify more than (a) parrot or lap dog!"", while later he is referred to as a ""common opportunist"" and the film is mostly about Barry trying to change what others think about him for the better. Whatever the case, the film is very well tied together by the employment of non-original music, adapted from the likes of Schubert, Bach and Mozart. Almost every scene is set to music of some sort, and the final duel near the end is given nail-biting tension by the sombre music throbbing in the background.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Like watching a very old oil painting dry... But somehow it remains engrossing!,"There is nothing about Barry Lyndon which is appealing to me. Everything is against it, and if it didn't have Stanley's name attached to it then I probably would never give it the time of day. It's basically a three hour period drama which moves at a snail's pace and is full of dull, stiff and unlikable characters. So, why did I like it? Why did I not find it tedious and boring? These are questions I'm still asking myself and it appears to be the hypnotic nature of Stanley's films. 2001: A Space Odyssey is painfully slow and has no memorable characters (except HAL) yet it's one of the best films I've ever seen.Let's start with its beauty. Even the haters can't deny the sheer gorgeousness of pretty much every shot. The film opens to a haunting classical score and throws up a landscape shot which could easily be mistaken for an oil painting. Every landscape/exterior shot had my jaw on the floor at the sheer beauty of it, and I'm not one to get all excited over scenery. I don't like to use the word 'perfect' because things rarely are, however that's exactly the word I'd use to describe some of the shots. Just perfect. The costumes and sets are wonderfully lavish too and do a great job of plunging you into the life and atmosphere of those times.Even though the film is a whopping 180 minutes there wasn't one moment when I was bored. Perhaps some parts dragged on for a little too long in the war half, but I was never fed up and the film didn't feel like it was three hours long. Not a lot happens but it somehow remains engrossing. It moves at its own pace and it seems to work well at creating an atmosphere that evokes its period.It's a very cold film and all the characters seem distant. Even the title character doesn't give much away, and lady Lyndon must say about four lines throughout the entire film! Something about it remains captivating though and not all of it is devoid of emotion. In fact, the scenes involving Lyndon and his son were very moving and quite powerful. It was also interesting how the film was told in two parts and both involving battlefields of one kind or another.Unfortunately, Ryan O Neal's performance is a little lacklustre. His Irish accent was all over the place and he didn't entirely convince in the role. The rest of the film however is quite exquisite. It's easy to see why people don't like it, because even I'm not quite sure what I found so appealing about it all. It is a technical master class though, and whilst it may be a step down from 2001: A Space Odyssey and A Clockwork Orange it is still a great film in its own right. Stanley returned to breaking the mould with his next film though, which could very well be my favourite from his filmography.",8.0,Anonymous,History
"Barry Lyndon is cinema at its purest, and is without a doubt one of its great achievements.","This is one film that many will not even think of attempting. It is three hours in length, it is based on a novel written in 1844 documenting the rise and fall of an Irishman who becomes part of 18th century English nobility, and it stars no one popular. But there is one compelling reason that dwarfs all excuses not to watch the film - it is directed by the late Stanley Kubrick. The director of influential film masterpieces such as 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968), Dr. Strangelove (1964), and A Clockwork Orange (1971), Kubrick is easily one of the greatest filmmakers of our time.Barry Lyndon is probably Kubrick's most underrated film, an extraordinary picture that so vividly evokes the time and mood of a distant past that one might have been inclined to believe that Kubrick had actually taken the hassle to travel back in time to film this. Shot by cinematographer John Alcott, who wins one of the film's four Oscars, Barry Lyndon is as beautiful as films get. Picturesque views of medieval England are captured with a wide lens that frequently zooms away from a focal point, giving 'eye-opening' visuals of classy architecture and elegiac costumes lived in and worn respectively by the noble people.Tremendous effort is made to film most of the interior scenes in natural light and in the 'enchanting hour' when everything radiates with misty perfection. Yet the most technically impressive aspect of Barry Lyndon remains to be the filming of interiors at night with the creative use of strategically-positioned candlelights which lend an almost warm, surreal touch to the film's already organic quality. Kubrick's eye for detail and his quest for the perfect shot (whose obsession with them is well-documented later in his career) will reward patient viewers because Barry Lyndon is simply innovative filmmaking in an old-fashioned setting.Ryan O'Neal plays the titular character Barry Lyndon opposite Marisa Berenson who is remarkable in her role as the widowed Lady Lyndon. Adapted from William Makepeace Thackeray's picaresque novel and written for the screen by Kubrick himself, the film is smartly split into two major acts - the unexpected rise of Redmond Barry who later becomes Barry Lyndon, and the decline of the latter whose acrimonious relationship with his stepson Lord Bullingdon primarily leads to his inevitable downfall.Despite the subject matter, Barry Lyndon is more engaging than one might have expected. Kubrick's use of classical music is a major reason and it could not have been more apt here with great selections like Handel's Sarabande. Another factor is the inclusion of several sequences of farcical duels between Barry and his 'nemesis' and war battles which feature brilliant tracking shots.Kubrick's films are mostly devoid of real emotions; they are mechanical, cold observations of society that are seldom optimistic. Barry Lyndon is no exception. Its frozen characters seem unable to dictate their lives; they feel trapped in Kubrick's masterful manipulation of a medium that so rarely embraces such a genre. Highly recommended, Barry Lyndon is cinema at its purest, and is without a doubt one of its great achievements.SCORE: 9.5/10 (www.filmnomenon.blogspot.com) All rights reserved!",10.0,Anonymous,History

"Kubrick's indomitable piece of cinematic wonder,","Kubrick's 3-hours epic about ups-and-downs of an Irish young man Redmond Barry (O'Neal) in the eighteenth century, narrated through an even-tempered and quite pleasing voice-over (Hordern), Barry is a farm boy raised by his mother (Kean) after lost his father in a duel, his puppy love with cousin Nora Brady (Hamilton) is curbed when Nora decides to marry Captain John Quin (Rossiter), who is able to pay for family debuts; an ensuing duel with John forces him to run away, but soon he is mugged penniless and joins the British Army and fights in the Seven Year's War (1756-1763), shell-shocked in the savagery of war, he takes French leave and takes on a a new identity, after a lovey-dovey time with a German wife Lischen (Körner), his disguised is exposed by Captain Potzdorf (Krüger), and is forced to join the Prussian Army.Then, things seem to be rosy after Barry shows his bravery and gains the trust of Potzdorf. After the war, he is sent to spy on a gambler Chevalier de Balibari (Magee) who also shares the Irish lineage, for whom he double-crosses Potzdorf and becomes his collaborator in the gamble games, eventually Chevalier brings him back to Britain where he woos the affluent Lady Lyndon (Berenson), and divided by an intermission, now starts the second half of his story - where many tragedies is awaiting for him.A thematic through-line is Barry's single-minded pursuit to be a nobleman, in the first half, his chivalry wins him admiration in the fist combat among soldiers, but in the real war there is no place for nobility, the gallant facade of infantry being used as canon fodder is ludicrous to comprehend, and a tease to the royal formality. So, as an upstart who marries a rich woman whom he barely loves, Barry is not that clever, since he is never cognizant of the simple fact that the snobbish upper class doesn't welcome parvenus, a significant ally should be his wife, if he cares to manifest his devotion and affections. But now his name is Mr. Barry Lyndon, all he needs is a title to secure the wealth for him and their young son Bryan (Morley), yet his philandering predisposition drives Lady Lyndon away and a critical chasm under the roof is between him and Lord Bullingdon (played by Savage and Vitali in different ages), Lady Lyndon's son from a previous marriage, who will bring about his undoing in the future where Barry becomes a miserable failure who eventually falls from the rank of a gentleman.One of the highly acclaimed aspects of this film is the lavish set production and inspiringly beguiling cinematography, the candle-lit scenes in the second half in particular, various tableaux vivants in stunning period costumes, imbues a transcendent beauty which intoxicates Barry and viewers alike, although underneath the finery, lies the stone-hearted defence system of a dying species. Duel is a key element in the film, from the opening one which dispatches Barry's father, to the one with John which kickstarts Barry's wandering adventures until the final one between him and Lord Bullingdon, which engagingly foregrounds Barry's flawed benevolence in sharp contrast with Bullingdon's craven and vengeful nature of an aristocrat. Also, a kind warning to those well-heeded families, don't ever let your young kids ride a horse, this and GONE WITH THE WIND (1939) are two brutal examples.BARRY LYNDON might fall short as a perfect epic because of it casts O'Neal as the lead, at the age of 33, he is mortifying in the opening when he supposes to be no more than a teenager, but thankfully, it transforms smoothly when Barry ages through the journey, but rarely his performance can galvanise the screen in the protracted duration, wanting of charisma debars audience from projecting a certain amount of sympathy to him, which is a dangerous defect for its epic scale. Even more befuddling is Berenson's Lady Lyndon, who only have a few lines altogether and is one-sidedly portrayed as a mistress who has no talent in governing her man, her children and her wealth, suffice to be Kubrick's last nail in the coffin for the doomed royalty. Numerous supporting characters come and go, barely have their scene-stealing moments, bar Leon Vitali's adult Lord Bullingdon, who is brilliant in the duelling part, Murray Melvin as Reverend Runt, whose malicious appearance is the barometer of haughtiness and Marie Kean as Barry's mother, unwittingly eggs him on to his ruin. Another chief accolade should be given to Leonard Rosenman, the music adaptor who won an Oscar for wondrously concatenating Kubrick's favourites classical pieces into the epic length, embellishes the narrative seamlessly and becomes the ballast for a great viewing experience.Winning four Oscars, BARRY LYNDON is notably being the most acknowledged features of Kubrick, but ironically, Kubrick lost all three nominations under his name (BEST PICTURE, BEST DIRECTOR and BEST ADAPTED SCREENPLAY). Probably not his best work, but unmistakably, it is an indomitable piece of cinematic wonder, not just for its exquisite etiquette, also an influential fable about breaking the royal orders.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Excellent historical film (especially for the costumes and scenography) but lacking a compelling narrative!,"Barry Lyndon is an accurate historical film but also far too ""obsessive"" in its attention to detail. Kubrick's directorial meticulousness is well known, but in this film it is perhaps exaggerated. The settings, costumes and photography are very appreciable. This film tells the story of a poor Irishman (Raymond Barry) in the eighteenth century, who tries to establish himself in a noble position. His life is dotted with failures and misfortunes until his miserable death in poverty. The story of the film, in Kubrick's vision, loses all narrative substance and becomes a pure aesthetic spectacle. The acting is quality but not exceptional and the slow pace of the direction is boring at times. This film is certainly well made, but it seems to focus more on the aesthetic aspect rather than that of entertainment. This film is like a nice gift package, empty inside.",8.0,Anonymous,History

Many, if not most, scenes could be displayed in art galleries as old masters and no-one would notice. At just over three hours long, the pace rarely seems to drag, because the viewer is so caught up in the mind-boggling beauty being paraded before his/her eyes.From the Thackeray novel of an Irish lad's adventures, rise in society and ultimate demise, Kubrick plays it as a tragi-comedy of manners, which fits well with the narration from the novel and the stagey visuals, but I found myself wishing for better rounded characters: Marisa Berenson should have been a key character, but she is hardly even given a line; Ryan O'Neal is actually rather good, but I'm sure he could have done even better with more script to work with. But characterisation has never been what Kubrick is about anyway, so I guess he was playing to his strengths. A monumental achievement that deserves to be more widely appreciated.",8.0,Anonymous,History
True Class,"This movie is a benchmark for who ever wants to direct a movie on a historical story. Trust me, this movie is without doubt the most beautiful movie ever made in the literal sense. The shots taken are awesome and breathtaking.Now coming to the movie, Barry Redmond grows up in Ireland and then certain circumstances lead him to go all over Europe and gets entangled in certain situations which lead him on the path to fortune. As everyone falls down one day, Barry also does his share of mistakes and pays for it.Only Kubrick can direct a story like this in such a beautiful way, Too good. To find a plot is one thing and to direct a movie in a nice way is another. The music is also a high point in the movie.I simply loved it. Stanley Kubrick has probably tried directing every genre of movie and it would be true to say that he has succeeded in his venture with flying colors.",10.0,Anonymous,History

The Napoleon of Film Meets His Waterloo,"Stanley Kubrick lost it all with BARRY LYNDON. Before this film, he was coming off ten years of magnificent screen classics: SPARTACUS, DR. STRANGELOVE, 2001 SPACE ODYSSEY, and A CLOCKWORK ORANGE. No other director has ever created four masterpieces in a row. Yet after this film, he was never the same again. What went wrong?From the very beginning of his career, Kubrick was a film maker who gambled, creating stories around ugly, stupid, or hateful characters. From the paranoid, bomb-crazy generals of DR. STRANGELOVE, to the lifeless, sleepwalking astronauts of 2001, to the brutal teenage bullies of A CLOCKWORK ORANGE, Kubrick had always insisted on putting the worst elements of mankind on screen and forcing audiences to cheer them on to a brutal, squalid ending. Why didn't the Kubrick attack pattern work again for BARRY LYNDON?Kubrick miscalculated by placing his new monster in a tranquil setting, where his personal ugliness seemed hurtful instead of liberating. Where Alex joyously splashes the blood of his victims on the sterile white walls of a barren future, Barry Lyndon rampages through a green and lush (and highly sentimentalized) British past where his personal rage is inexplicable. That is to say, it is inexplicable in visual terms. The plot clumsily piles up reasons for Barry to hate the world -- betrayed by his family, by the army, by society at large -- but the betrayals don't stick because Kubrick has fallen prey to the impulse to prettify every scene and frame. One look at the sterile interior of the Korova Milkbar explains the murderous rage of Alex and his droogs, whereas four hours of picture postcard views of Olde England make Barry Lyndon's behavior seem arbitrary and unearned.Another issue is the problem of punishment. Alex of A CLOCKWORK ORANGE is a hateful character, but he is knocked out of action fairly early.Indeed for the last two thirds of the film he is the victim, putting the audience in his corner for a last minute resurrection that has the force of a darkly ironic yet undeniably stimulating triumph of the human spirit. Barry Lyndon, on the other hand, grows ever more spiteful and cruel as his wealth and prestige increase, thus making it almost impossible to like him or sympathize with his behavior. When he is crippled and broken at the end of the film, there is no ironic victory for the human spirit, and no sense of justice being served, merely a squalid end to a pointless tale of human degradation -- in impossibly lush surroundings that seem entirely unrelated to the inner lives of the characters.Kubrick lost it all with BARRY LYNDON, and yet even in defeat it's impossible not to admire his imagination, courage, and daring, offering time and time again to challenge society's self-deceiving hangups and stale pieties.",,Anonymous,History
...Aristocratic perfection by Kubrick - but...,"This film by Stanley Kubrick is perhaps my least favorite of his. It is still an excellent film, which says it all about Kubrick - one of the greatest film making artists to have walked this Earth.A perfect aspect about the film is its script, which I find magnificent as an adapted screenplay by Kubrick. To me this is mere perfection. Incredible linguistic detail, perfectly casted unto almost every actor and actress. An example hereof is the wedding scene (no spoilers).But... the film did not move me much - I simply did not find it touching (albeit technically perfect), and this is my issue with the film. At best, I was close to emotionally engaged in a scene between Lord Bullingdon and Barry Lyndon.Back to its technical merits:Cinematography is - as always in a Kubrick film - fantastic and astonishing. Here with elaborate use of interesting zoom-outs, wide shots, and tracking shots from the brilliant Kubrick cinematography, revealing the beautiful British landscapes.Great score - albeit demanding classical pieces to my ears.Inviting narrative style, and an excellent directional choice of my liking.All in all, I believe the life of Barry Lyndon is magnificently portrayed by one of the greatest masters of the art form, but lacking in emotion.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Kubrick Paints With Light and Shadow,"Had Rembrandt made films in the 20th century, they could have looked and felt something like this. Natural light taken to its extreme, painterly mise-en-scène and colour, wildly riotous humour. Death.Indeed, each frame exudes audaciously utter compositional mastery, and Kubrick paints with light and shadow in ways quite unmatched, perhaps equalled only by the virtuosity of Malick and Lubezki's.Kubrick, to my mind, is a superb humanist, somewhat like Imamura, yet his sense of humour is more approachable. The visual gags of the film are brilliant and hilarious. The first part of the film is fireworks from beginning to end, and it's the second part where Kubrick is able to offer a cataclysmic counterpoint that is decidedly slow in its accretion, escalating from the high-flying superficiality of Barry's character and his lack of forethought for the consequences of his actions. Or, if you like, things just befall him without any dramatic sense of cause and consequence.""The Draughtsman's Contract"" (1982) would be a fine place to go from here, since it's visually as painterly, made by a painter, influenced by another painter's notions.",9.0,Anonymous,History
The vicious circle of human greed and naivité,"This life story of an insignificant Irishman is one in which the winners are losers and vice versa, in which formal beauty, decency and status can only be acquired with a refined yet remorseless skill and in which only the movements of the hands and eyes reveal what the icy faces want to hide. The formal beauty of the shots masks the actual ruthlessness, sadness and greed of the characters. Rather than giving a historical account on how this life was like, Kubrick reminds us how Barry's rise and fall is just one example of the vicious circle of human cunning for opulence. Barry was not the first to be called Lyndon, but he is certainly not the last.10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,History
"""I'm not sorry. And I'll not apologize. And I'd as soon go to Dublin as to hell. "" - Redmond Barry","'Barry Lyndon' is one of Stanley Kubrick's non-talked about films. That's not a big surprise in the slightest because 'Barry Lyndon' doesn't really break ground or re-invent the wheel really like Kubrick's other efforts like 'A Clockwork Orange', 'Dr. Strangelove' or '2001: A Space Odyssey'. That isn't to say it's a bad movie, it's actually a great film! 'Barry Lyndon' might just be one of the best period pieces of all time, and since the legendary genius Stanley Kubrick was behind it, does it really surprise you? It's lavish and extravagant beauty will impress you even if the story gets a tiny bit dull at points. Kubrick achieves making another great movie with his beautiful and uncompromising portrait of the British Seven Years War era, 'Barry Lyndon', based on William Makepeace Thackeray's beloved novel.'Barry Lyndon' is the story of a bright young Irish lad named Redmond Barry (Ryan O'Neal). He's a sly, slick and smooth conman who screws and kills his way to the top. When he leaves his home in Ireland after dueling with his cousin and love interest's (Marie Kean) fiancé, Captain John Quin (Leonard Rossiter), he gets robbed by a famous highwayman, Captain Feeny (Arthur O'Sullivan) and is forced to join the British army for money. During a y battle, Redmond, the common opportunist, deserts his army after the of his dear friend Captatin Grogan (Godfrey Quigley), steals a Lieutenant's horse, and takes his identity. Just when Redmond thinks he is safe, he is caught by a Prussian Captain (Hardy Kruger) and forced to join the Prussian army as a private. Redmond later saves a Prussian general and gets promoted to Corporal. He then is ordered by Lord Ludd (Steven Berkoff) to spy on a sneaky French Chevalier (Patrick Magee) and tell the Lord the Chevalier's secrets and plans. Redmond has other ideas, and decides to side with the Chevalier but pretend to still be working for Ludd and give him useless information. The Chevalier takes Redmond under his wing, teaching him everything including how to cheat in gambling. During Redmond's adventures with the Chevalier he meets the captivating and beautiful Lady Lyndon (Marisa Berenson) who's married to the rich and powerful Sir Charles Reginald Lyndon (Frank Middlemass). The greedy Redmond decides to take full advantage of the opportunity of Sir Lyndon and marrying his wife for money. Barry succeeds, and the story from there captures Sir Redmond Barry Lyndon's downfall. The film also stars Gay Hamilton, Philip Stone, Murray Melvin, Andre Morell and Leon Vitali as Lady Lyndon's vengeful but weak son.Stanley Kubrick does a fantastic job with William Makepeace Thackeray's legendary tale of the sly Irish rogue, Barry Lyndon, who is ultimately consumed by his own greed. Kubrick's sense of direction in this is nothing short of breathtaking, his use of vibrant and alluring colors always keep 'Barry Lyndon' interesting when the story sometimes lags during it's three hour and four minute runtime. Kubrick's script is superb as to be expected from any of his motion pictures, and I can't imagine any writer that could have done a better job adapting Thackeray's novel to the film medium. In 'Barry Lyndon', the acting is one of the finest qualities. Ryan O'Neal gives his finest performance ever as the sneaky fortune-hunter. O'Neal really makes you understand the logic of Redmond Barry Lyndon, and why he does what he does. The supporting cast highlights are Patrick Magee, Godfrey Quigley, Murray Melvin, Arthur O'Sullivan, Leonard Rossiter, Gay Hamilton, Frank Middlemass and Leon Vitali who plays his role of the tragic and clumsy sissy to utter perfection. Marisa Berenson is very so-so in a particularly bland part, but besides her everyone else does an acceptable job. The costumes, set, makeup, cinematography and music score of 'Barry Lyndon' are without a doubt incredible, but like I made reference to before, the story drags towards the middle. You really have to be dedicated to watching 'Barry Lyndon' because if you're not you may just fall asleep during the plot slouches. Otherwise, 'Barry Lyndon' is near-brilliant.I recommend 'Barry Lyndon' to period piece fans and Kubrick fans who have not yet seen it already.

A Visual Feast,"Most of Kubrick's presentations are pretty non-conventional, except for a few films such as 'Spartacus', 'Paths of Glory' and 'Barry Lyndon'. You're never quite sure what you're going to get with a Kubrick film, but with Barry Lyndon it's a pretty straightforward plot told with a running narrative.I do have a few gripes with the film such as its overly long running time at three hours, as well as its slowness in certain areas, especially at the beginning. Some of the characters are rather wooden and there's a certain dated feel about the production, but that's pretty much my criticism all used up.Contrary to the opinion of a minor amount of reviewers, Ryan O'Neal's performance is very believable. His aura lacks a little in conviction for the part, many feel, but I can't find anything wrong with it, neither the choice to cast him as Barry Lyndon. Even his Irish accent is tolerable. There are many memorably frail/weedy characters in the film such as Catptain Quin, Reverend Runt and Lord Bullingdon, but who only succeed in reinforcing Ryan O'Neal's character as a strong, competent and pretty straightforward opportunist, instead of the sneaky, snivelling sort of character that perhaps we might expect.Marisa Berenson is absolutely out of this world in terms of cold, dignified and unamused beauty. She is the catalyst of the stunning characteristics of this film. She has very little to say and practically no personality throughout, living her life in a permanently formal and non-amused bubble, but her simple portrayal of out-of-sight dignity is compelling. She gets more distant and gradually sadder as the film progresses, even her incredibly stylized wigs getting greyer over time too.Continuing on the theme of beauty, Marisa Berenson loses by a slender nose to the unbelievable camera work. Kubrick uses a long lens to imperceptibly zoom in on the action, then panning back to reveal the whole scene being filmed. His choice of scenery is without doubt the defining characteristic of this film. Generally, I don't consider beautiful imagery or colours to be a very important aspect of good film-making, but in Barry Lyndon it's the aspect that I enjoyed the most. The costumes are wonderful, but the outdoor landscapes and panoramic scenes are better still. The choice of autumnal colours and historic backdrops is a sight to behold and each time you see the film you appreciate how much thought went into filming certain scenes.If you're looking for style and content, narrated at a leisurely pace, you can't go far wrong with Barry Lyndon.",9.0,Anonymous,History

Barry Lyndon: Timeless Beauty,"In the realm of cinema, where visuals often vie for supremacy, Stanley Kubrick's ""Barry Lyndon"" stands as a testament to the unparalleled marriage of storytelling and visual artistry. Released in 1975, this period drama has not only endured the test of time but has solidified its place as the epitome of visual splendor. The film story is adapted from the book ""The Luck of Barry Lyndon"", written by the 19th century author, William Makepeace Thackeray, Published in 1844.The films narrative is divided into two parts and follows the life of Redmond Barry:
Redmond Barry an Irishman, played by the american actor with an irish name, Ryan O'Neal, who transforms into Barry Lyndon, rising from a rural background to European aristocracy. The film explores his experiences in love, betrayal, and social climbing in 18th-century Europe. It portrays Barry's journey through the Seven Years' War, his success as a war hero, con man and as a wealthy man.Cinematographer John Alcott, who was a frequent collaborator with Kubrick, masterfully employs natural light in a way that transcends mere technical achievement. The film's iconic candle-lit scenes, shot with specially modified lenses, capture the essence of 18th-century Europe with a painterly finesse. Each frame is a living tableau, a meticulously composed work of art that pays homage to the great painters of the period. Kubrick's decision to utilize the groundbreaking Mitchell BNC camera, initially developed for NASA, allowed for unprecedented flexibility in capturing scenes in natural light. The resulting visuals are nothing short of breathtaking, with landscapes bathed in a soft, diffused glow that lends an almost dreamlike quality to the film. Every exterior shot becomes a living landscape painting, a testament to Kubrick's meticulous attention to detail. Stanley Kubrick's direction is characterized by his trademark precision and control. The deliberate pacing of the film allows for the exploration of complex characters and themes. The performances in ""Barry Lyndon"" are noteworthy, with Ryan O'Neal delivering a nuanced portrayal of the protagonist. The cast, including supporting actors such as Marisa Berenson and Patrick Magee, contributes to the film's overall authenticity and emotional resonance.The film's commitment to authenticity extends to its costumes (designed by the master costume designers Ulla-Britt Söderlund and Milena Canonero), locations, and even its use of classical music. The soundtrack, featuring masterpieces by Handel and Schubert, serves as a sublime accompaniment to the unfolding narrative, enhancing the emotional impact of each scene (each painting). The incredible track from Barry Lyndon ""Sarabande"" composed by George Frideric Handel and performed by ""National Philharmonic Orchestra"" perfectly fits to describe the story of Barry musically.Kubrick shows yet again just how important the craft in film is and why you should strive for perfection in your work. ""Barry Lyndon"" is Kubrick's greatest work besides his 1968 film, 2001: A Space Odyssey, Which I consider to be the greatest achievement in cinematic history. The three hour running time in ""Barry Lyndon"" is necessary and is nothing to complain about, I found every hour of the film to be very entertaining, which is something a lot of people will criticise about this film, a lack of entertainment, but I felt very drawn in to the world Kubrick had adapted from the book. This is best presented by the late critic for ""Chicago Sun Times"" Roger Ebert in his review of the film: ""Some people find ""Barry Lyndon"" a fascinating, if cold, exercise in masterful filmmaking; others find it a terrific bore. I have little sympathy for the second opinion; how can anyone be bored by such an audacious film? ""Barry Lyndon"" isn't a great entertainment in the usual way, but it's a great example of directorial vision: Kubrick saying he's going to make this material function as an illustration of the way he sees the world"".I consider ""Barry Lyndon"" to be the 4th greatest film of all time, and the most beautiful film ever made.Rating: 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,History

"This truly is ""the forgotten masterpiece of Stanley Kubrick"".","This really is as people often refer to it, ""the forgotten masterpiece of Stanley Kubrick"". It surprises me that this film has been forgotten and overshadowed by his other films, as it is almost as breathtaking as 2001, and as well crafted as all of his later films. This should, and hopefully is ranking among cinema history's greatest epic films. The only other film of the same genre (and length for that sake), that captivated me as much as this film did, was Coppolas ""The Godfather"". This film deserves to be as revered and commonly know as that film is. It is of course not Kubricks all time greatest motion picture,but should still rank as on of histories greatest motion pictures, as should all of his films be. I cannot recommend this film enough, every frame of this film is like a beautiful 18th century painting, and it's use of music is nothing but stunning.It is a long film indeed, but that only allows us to enjoy more of the film, longer. I would recommend this to any film buff, but I warn you of it's complexity. This is not a film for everyone, definitely not todays film fans who seem more impressed by short, low-brow, action films, will not appreciate this film in a way it deserves. (Ironically this was the reason for it's box-office). However if you don't fall under this category, you will have missed out on a great deal if you have not seen this magnificent film. I give this film nothing less than a full 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Monumental Bore-athon By Terminally Overrated Director,"Is Stanley Kubrick the most overrated filmmaker ever? He certainly had prodigious technical gifts, ""Barry Lyndon"" may not be be the best looking film ever but it certainly comes close, stunning at times in it's use of natural light. He acted like an artist, slow-working and perfectionist. He was certainly uncompromising. In short Kubrick looked and acted like a genius, luckily for him in the world of cinema this was enough to get him proclaimed a genius. All of his films were met by gushing reviews - witness the response to the execrable ""Eyes Wide Shut"". Yet any true critical response to his films should attempt to explain the utter emptiness of his post ""Dr Strangelove"" work. ""Barry Lyndon"" is important here because for all its beauty this is as vapid as film gets. Kubrick drains all life out of characters, the wit and irony of Thackeray totally lost. Ryan O'Neal shows that TV support roles are his natural home (Paper Moon is the only film he didn't ruin), and the rest of the cast are forgettable. Kubrick is art-cinema for those who are scared of real art - it challenges one after all, he is great cinema for those who believe that great cinema consists of nice looking pictures. He is intellectual cinema for the simple minded. There is more life and art in 10 minutes of a Jason Statham film than in this bore. So yes I believe he is overrated and this piece of dross is first exhibit in the case.",3.0,Anonymous,History
Tough to Hate but Kubrick Makes You,"Barry Lyndon is tough to hate, beautiful photography, costumes, candlelit scenes and all, but it's really a terrible film and probably Kubrick's worst, down there with The Shining and Full Metal whatever. Not much happens, and when it does it's with horrible non-actors at the center.Mostly you go crazy with boredom watching this lifeless, unbelievable mess. At least it seems to have a point, unlike Shining, which is completely pointless. And it is art, unlike Full Metal whatever, which is simply a mirror of reality, completely artless. For 18th Century costume drama and authenticity, I prefer The Duellists, a small, unpretentious film by Ridley Scott, who can make a movie move, or Amadeus, with a real script, acting, and edgy performances and directorial choices that enlighten.Barry Lyndon is some kind of phony experiment that sacrifices the audience on behalf of Kubrick's ""vision."" Was he trying to say that acting is nothing but moving a few dummies around in front of the lens? Is this movie all about the lens? Who cares. That's not enough.Ryan O'Neal is so bad, and Marisa Berenson so blah, that all the high-falutin photography and fancy dresses fade into meaninglessness. O'Neal's character is an Irishman who climbs through English society with a brogue and goes to Mass? In the 17th Century Catholics were being hung for going to Mass - the Penal Laws weren't repealed until the 1830s. Certainly the native Irish had no entree into colonial English society, period, end of story. So much for Kubrick's vaunted fanatical management of historical detail. The story is simply unbelievable.In France they call a model a ""mannequin,"" and Berenson, an It-Girl of her era, is truly is as lifeless as a stuffed dummy. Maybe she had some lines originally and was so bad, worse than O'Neal even, they shut her up. Her face is a beautiful mask - literally. Lifeless, stiff, inexpressive. That pretty much sums up this pretty, but lifeless, experiment.",,Anonymous,History
"Slow-Moving, But Kubrick Does It Again!","Stanley Kubrick has returned after his 1971's controversial success A Clockwork Orange with his tonally different 1975 feature, Barry Lyndon. His last feature was a movie that was ultra violent and about a totalitarianism society. This movie is different by a wide margin. It has more of a historical value because it takes place in England during the Seven Years' War and we get a sense of English society at the time. It is also based off the works of famed nineteenth century writer William Makepeace Thackeray. This film also has a lovely atmospheric air to it. Kubrick, as usual, masterfully write this feature. You could tell that this is his pet project. However, the movie does clock in at over three hours and with the lack of action, there can be a dull moment or two to be had. After all, I feel the aristocratic world can get somewhat boring at times. That being said, we have Kubrick on the top of his game as he created a valued historical narrative that remains mostly interesting and our eyes are able to feast on perfect costuming and successful camera experimenting. Essentially, Kubrick and cinematographer John Alcott shot the film without the use of electrical light, and that is why the look of the film seemed a bit odd compared to other films.Narratively, I felt the first hour of the film was the strongest. I found the last two hours enjoyable, but it would be very hard to top the perfect narrative of the first hour. During theS 1700's in Ireland, Redmond Barry (Ryan O'Neal) is a man who is in love with his cousin, Nora. After Nora gets engaged to the British Captain John Quinn, Barry challenges him to a duel. He wins the duel and he escapes to Dublin, but he gets robbed. Left with no choice, Barry joins the British Army to fight in the Seven Years' War. He decides to desert the army, and he eventually gets forced to join the Prussian Army where he becomes the protégé of Chevalier de Balibari (Patrick Magee). He soon marries the Lady Lyndon (Marisa Berenson) , but downfall is the near future as Barry's obsession with nobility will become the downfall of his family and fortune.As Stanley Kubrick is wont to do, he developed a cast that not many people may be familiar with. But because Kubrick always know what he is doing, the cast somehow works out well. The biggest name here is Ryan O'Neal and he is not even that much of a household name. He opened eyes with his role in The Love Story, so that is why people may recognize him. I thought he did a really good job. I was invested in his character throughout the entire film. His character could have worked as a completely serious character (and there are some very serious dramatic moments), but I love how he interjected some humor into his role. I also enjoyed Patrick Magee's performance. Magee is best known for his work in A Clockwork Orange as the writer who gets robbed, and I thought his performance here was a really enjoyable one.I love Kubrick's taste of music in his films. Of course everyone knows about the famous music he used in 2001: A Space Odyssey and to an extent in A Clockwork Orange. So we know he has a passion for classical music based on his previous work. So it should come to no surprise he uses composers like Bach and Mozart to enhance his movie. A very good score which makes this movie even the more enjoyable.Overall, Barry Lyndon is another fine piece of filmmaking from the legendary director Stanley Kubrick. It's a bit strange because upon release in 1975, the film actually didn't do too well critically and financially. People called it a disappointment because it was a completely different movie than expected and wondered why he would make a period piece that has plenty of English tax lingo and people cheating on each other. The movie may not have been a financial success, but the critical steam has built up over time and nowadays, people rank the movie as one of Kubrick's best. It is not the perfect masterpiece as his previous films, but its still an enjoyable costume drama that tends to be a little stuffy and overlong. However, it has an excellent first half of the film plus the movie makes good use of music, costumes, set design, and everything regarding the beautiful visuals.My Grade: A-",9.0,Anonymous,History
A technically perfect film,"""Barry Lyndon"" is unanimously regarded as a technically stunning film. Special lenses had to make sure that candle light in interior surroundings looked natural.In my opinion Stanley Kubrick is a master in using music in his films. A good example is ""2001: A space Odyssey"" (1968), but Barry Lyndon"" is his Magnus Opus in this respect. All the music is from the same period as the story (Schubert, Bach, Handel etc) and is perfectly combined with the individual scenes. Listen to the music accompanying the duel scene between Barry Lyndon and Lord Bullingdon, just like a thunderstorm approachting from afar.""Barry Lyndon"" is a picaresque film. In such a film the main character has obvious flaws, but is sympathetic all the same. Most of the times the film has a happy ending for the main character. Just look at""Tom Jones"" (1963, Tony Richardson).Barry Lyndon however is anything but sympathetic. He is selfish and treats people who care for him badly. The film is a rather symmetrical ""rise and fall"" film in which the trickery and deceit that helps Barry in the first half, turns aginst him in the second.The film ends decidely in a minor key. The negative view on human nature that permeates the film was responsible for the fact that the film didn't do well at the box office. Later the film was rehabilitated artisticly, but that didn't help Kubrick much to get enough finance for is his much cheried Napoleon project (which, if realised, would be situated in roughly the same time).",9.0,Anonymous,History
Kubrick's overlooked classic,"""Barry Lyndon"" is a work of art. Meaning it is like a painting put onto film. It is as if director Stanley Kubrick transported us into the world of the paintings on the walls of a fine art gallery. Released in 1975, between ""A Clockwork Orange"" (1971) and ""The Shining"" (1980), ""Barry Lyndon"" is perhaps the most overlooked of Kubrick's later films.Like Kubrick's ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" and ""Full Metal Jacket,"" ""Barry Lyndon"" is a disjointed story. Michael Hordern's narration, while sometimes stating the obvious, holds the movie together and eases the transition between sequences. The movie is split into two parts, which can quickly be summed up as Barry's rise in the first half and fall in the second.The first half is Redmond Barry's rags-to-riches story. Barry is a sympathetic character. He is young and naive. He is in love with his cousin, but too shy to touch her. He is simultaneously awkward and stubborn as he picks a fight with his cousin's suitor, and later duels him. After the duel, Barry has to leave home, and he gets robbed at gun point on his way to town. He eventually joins the army, but later deserts, only to be conscripted into another army. He falls in with a wealthy gentleman, and begins his ascent into the life of an aristocrat.The second half documents Barry's fall. He marries the beautiful and (more importantly) wealthy Lady Honoria Lyndon, and changes his name to Barry Lyndon. In his quest for acceptance among the aristocracy he squanders his wife's wealth and step-son's inheritance, alienating his family. As Barry cheats on his beautiful and generous wife, the character we sympathized with in the first half gradually forces us to view him with cold detachment, which is what I think Kubrick was expecting the audience to do through the cinematography he used.One camera technique Kubrick employs throughout is to center close-up on a character, and then zoom out, letting our eyes take in the full setting. The characters may take the beautiful scenery for granted, but Kubrick makes sure the audience doesn't. While this worked in some scenes, I thought it was overused, and created a barrier between the audience and the characters at times. The characters are like the bloodless portraits adorning an art gallery.The duels and battle scenes, however, find the perfect tone.

"Kubrick revisits the misapplication of money, status and class","Having watched this film ( Barry Lyndon )amongst all his others at least once a year, it has become apparent to me that Stanley Kubrick was fascinated with the insidious marriage of ambition and money, however beautiful his films were;( and they ARE beautiful, despite the apparent contradiction between a world gone wrong and the beauty that is there despite this - what a visionary!). All the misguided or malevolent protagonists of his films are male: they kill, lie, cheat, abuse, brag, swagger, dismiss, inveigle, assume superiority by virtue of social standing, hate and blame others for their own predicament, feel better when they look upon a lesser person and relegate women to, at best, the role of a social Geisha;- at worst, the parasitic whore that Mommy and Daddy always warned us about, portrayed through the eyes of the 'rational' male with all of his virtues listed above. All of the influential characters are male. Witness the dreadfully violent social scramble of The Killing; the technocratic monetarist showdown of 2001; the rape, violence and feel good factor of the Droogs; the damning indictment of social climbing and the class system based on wealth in Barry Lyndon; the locked-in familial violence of The Shining with its blame apportioned to the woman, the child and the African - American,- everyone except Jack himself; the controlling male class in Eyes Wide Shut* with its assumption that ANYTHING can be bought (the bottomless wallet), the interchangeable women as objects of desire,(literally,as actors, and metaphorically - the two Mandys - one live and one a corpse), male irritation at a woman's ability to make him feel inadequate unless he can possess, buy, control, or dispose of them (ref: Zeigler and drugs OD, implied murder; corruption; procuring women for sex etc.); and, of course, the ultimate irritation and social embarrassment - death. What could be more inconvenient than your little woman having the gall to die on you? Note too the blithe acceptance of Imperialism manifested in the form of a compliant reporter and apologist for American Foreign Policy as displayed by Pvt. Joker, the grinning indifferent witness whose complicity and desire for male acceptance allows him to shoot an injured woman dead and secretly congratulate himself on his humanitarianism. Note too, the use of actors twice, as if to hammer the point home - Joe Turkel, Sterling Hayden, Philip Stone, Leonard Rossiter, Peter Sellers, James Mason, Pat Roach** et al: all insidiously wicked and manipulative, or just plain dumb, their thoughts, misapprehensions and lies communicated softly, violently or socially correctly, often wrapped in a banknote. Social acceptability can even be granted to a paedophile if he's 'acceptable' or rich enough. This remarkable director knew EXACTLY what to do with the greatest art form that the 20th century gave us - his legacy is a unique insight into the human condition and the state of male Western morality through the medium of cinema. I have barely scraped the surface of his art - for this, I cannot apologise enough. Edward de Bono says that, 'A powerful way of treating opposing ideas is to suppose that each one is correct under certain circumstances'...Alas, Stanley Kubrick could see straight through such fallacies and demonstrate the endemic social and political hypocrisy and corruption of the world we tolerate with consummate ease through the medium he loved and we continue to love. How do you thank somebody for such a legacy?Incidentally, the great film writer and critic Michel Ciment compared 'Eyes Wide Shut' to a late Rembrandt. What a masterpiece of understatement, as I'm sure he'd agree. I certainly hope he does - I don't want to be pounded into hamburger in some ritual of film critic's machismo should we ever meet!!! But I flatter myself - I'm just an enthusiast in august company.Mike Winston, Birmingham, U.K.* See' Tinker, Taylor, Soldier, Spy' by John le Carre for the possible origin of this unusual phrase.** The late Pat Roach - A resident of Erdington, Birmingham, U.K. and a true gentleman, sadly missed by everyone who knew him.

the most underrated film ever made!!!,"On release, Barry Lyndon was critically savaged for no real good reason, some even saying that the film was too beautiful. although critics are more correct then you would usually think in most cases, in this case however they couldn't have been more incorrect.One certainly wonders why it was so picked upon, in fact I havent a clue why as this is simply one of cinema's finest achievements. After Dr strangelove, 2001: A Space Odyssey and A Clockwork Orange, three more of the finest by the man himself, Stanley Kubrick. You could be forgiven if you had doubts whether he could do it a fourth time, thanks to John Alcott's amazing, rich cinematography, Ken Adam's note perfect production design and of course Stanley Kubrick's exciting, brilliant, matchless direction, this is simply gripping and exhilarating to watch, every frame dripping with pure class, the screenplay finely honed, sensible, realistic and the performances surprisingly excellent, especially Ryan O Neal who in other films like Walter Hill's The Driver is rather bland, but here his potential is realised a hundred fold.But Marisa Berenson also scores as his wife giving a subtle engaging performance giving justice to the story, the script and the direction.Based on a minor Thackeray novel, the story under Kubrick's masterful touch becomes anything but minor which follows O Neal's adventurer Redmond Barry who as an army deserter rises to the top of high society by marrying Mrs Lyndon ( Berenson ) but due to his greed falls slowly to the bottom. Together with the Godfather Part 2, Barry Lyndon is perhaps the ultimate cinematic statement of how power and greed corrupt and thanks to Kubrick who also adapted the script meshes together this important theme with the visual splendor to achieve a perfectly balanced, atmospheric three dimensional effect that is often staggering and heart poundingly gripping to watch. Perhaps the best example of this is when the circumstances of Redmond's greed catch up with him and he takes part in a duel with his son in law, not only does the pure brilliance and the perfect co ordination of the scene blow you away, it's the sheer suspense of wanting to know what happens to Barry next as despite his greed is still an human and most of us would do the same if given the chance and we deep down know it. Winning oscars deservedly for it's photography, art direction, costumes and adapted score, there can be doubt of it's sheer brilliance, a film manages to be different from Kubrick's others, substituting his trademark icy intelligence for a more suitable emotional warmth, this is undoubtedly his most moving picture, together with A Clockwork Orange this is a great contender for the honour of his best picture but most importantly, ignore the critics, it's an utterly unmissable epic of the finest kind, in fact as Barry Norman said "" it's the most beautiful film i can remember "" too right.",10.0,Anonymous,History
i like the message of this film,"stanley kubrick's films remind me on cartoons a little. probably because characters are similar in both and both have beautiful/different images and both break the rules in a way.i think that main message of this film is that people have allways rivaled/competed/quarrelled with each other and allways will and that this is by far the main goal or purpose of their lives and they find it most important thing. i think today it is still the same. but when 100 years or so pass these things (money, social status, pride, comfort, to be better than other people, to be recognized by other people, etc) which were so important then to those people aren't important anymore. what's important are the things those people did that are still important to people living today, or that people living today and in the future will have some use of: science, films, music etc.i also like very much characters which are very calm and rarely show any excitement or emotions.i like epilogue of the film the most:""It was in the reign of George III that the aforesaid personages lived and quarrelled; good or bad, handsome or ugly, rich or poor they are all equal now.""9/10",9.0,Anonymous,History

I wasn't sure if I could put up with 3 hours of Ryan O'Neal pretending to be Irish (recalling Kevin Costner in ROBIN HOOD), but as someone else has mentioned, O'Neal and the rest of the cast are carried along by the beauty of the film. But to be fair, he wasn't half bad, and the rest of the cast was superb. Kubrick masterfully makes us believe that we really are in 18th century Europe, full of beautiful landscapes and majestic buildings.

"Visually stunning, Kubrick delivers in ""Barry Lyndon"" an intriguing story, which follows the trajectory of a young dreamer until his transformation into what he hated most","When we hear about Stanley Kubrick, it is unlikely that we will not make the most obvious associations such as: ""A Clockwork Orange"", ""The Shining"" and ""2001: A Space Odyssey"". After all, it is impossible not to recognize the legacy of his most emblematic films, which changed cinema forever. However, looking at the directors less talked about films is realizing that his talent and mastery are much stronger than imagined. Thus, we realize that Kubrick truly comes close to having a practically impeccable filmography.Opened by a gun duel where Redmond Barry's father (Ryan O'Neal) ends up dead, the film already sets the stage for what is to come in the next three hours. Its narrative is divided into two parts: the rise (which tells how Redmond became Barry Lyndon) and fall (in a succession of misfortunes that occurred after his marriage) of a young opportunist, who after losing the love of his life, He is forced to abandon his home in Ireland and join the army in the Seven Years' War. At the same time that Redmond rises socially and stabilizes in a society of nobles through marriage, he also makes constant transitions between paternal figures who welcome him. While in the role of father, he fails drastically when he fails to win the affection of Bullingdon, his wife's firstborn, and especially in the tragedy that occurs with Bryan, his son with Lady Lyndon.The magnificent look of ""Barry Lyndon"" is the result of impeccable technical work, firmly managed by Stanley Kubrick, who used paintings from that period as inspiration. The detailed costumes identical to those used in the 18th century (merit of Milena Canonero and Ulla-Britt Söderlund), the detailed and precise art direction by Roy Walker, who recreates everything from the interior of the castles to small details such as the weapon used in duels, and John Alcott's stunning photography, which explores the beautiful landscapes and accurately captures the interior environments lit only by candlelight (thanks to a special lens made for NASA), are directly responsible for the film's stunning look. It is clear that Kubrick's millimetric framing and his usual perfectionism are directly linked to the visual splendor that delights the spectators' eyes. Even the zoom used extensively by the director in ""Barry Lyndon"" is important, as it slowly gives us the beautiful shots, as if they were true Renaissance paintings. These moving works of art seem practically alive and need to be appreciated slowly and the zoom allows us to take in every detail, as if we were actually seeing a painting. To top it off, the makeup accurately portrays the customs of men and women of the time, as we can see, for example, during card games or meetings of English high society, and the beautiful soundtrack by Leonardo Rosenman and The Chieftains uses flutes and piano to compose classical melodies that immerse us even more in the medieval period.But ""Barry Lyndon"" doesn't just live off the beautiful images it has. Kubrick's own stylish script (based on a book by William Makepeace Thackeray) is acidic - when in the narrator's voice - and full of wonderful dialogue - when in the characters' voices. Furthermore, it competently shows what the game of interests was like at the time to increase the family's social level and possessions, as we can see right at the beginning through the arranged marriage of Nora (Gay Hamilton) and John Quin (Leonard Rossiter) and, later, with the wedding of Barry and Lady Lyndon (Marisa Berenson). Another curious feature of the script is that it does not insist on surprising the viewer, revealing important details considerably in advance through the mysterious narrator, who warns, for example, of the future death of Bryan (David Morley) and, in this way, prepares the viewer for the that will happen, avoiding melodrama. Note that even the chapters reveal Barry's fate both times they appear. The narration, in fact, is one of the highlights of the film, full of ironic and satirical phrases, such as when the narrator explains that the Lyndon couple now live separately so that the mother takes care of the children while Barry takes charge of the pleasures of the world. Good humor is also present in the creative ways in which Barry finds to escape the different situations he finds himself in, such as when he accidentally comes across the uniforms of two homosexual leaders of the British army or when he impersonates the Chevalier (Patrick Magee) to escape from Berlin and the Prussian army.In addition to the refined humor, Kubrick also makes ""Barry Lyndon"" a thorough character study. The transition from an idealistic and correct young man to a selfish and rude man is extremely slow and almost imperceptible, thanks to the rhythm used in the narrative. In this way, we barely notice that Barry undergoes such a transformation, especially because the character is never portrayed as a good or bad person, as the final message makes a point of reinforcing. Even when he shows himself to be a terrible husband and a violent man, especially against his stepson, Barry also demonstrates qualities that bring him closer to the viewer, such as the fact that he is an excellent father. Tony Lawson's editing is directly responsible for maintaining this slow and contemplative pace of the film, which appropriately allows the viewer to delight in the beautiful images they see. However, it continues to lead the narrative for many years without ever sounding episodic (except for the division into chapters), as we can see in the subtle jump of eight years from the childhood of Lord Bullingdon (Leon Vitali) to the childhood of Bryan Lyndon. The connections are made abruptly, quite direct, but they also require the attention of the attentive and active viewer throughout the film. Another tool used masterfully to exclaim the contrast between the two parts of the story is zoom. In the first half of the film, they take place almost mainly in a free field, moving from closed and medium shots to open shots, highlighting the chances and opportunities that the protagonist can take from each situation. While in the final part, as Barry is beaten, they are also used, only in a more frightening way, always endorsing decline and loneliness.The tense sequence of Barry's departure from Ireland, which begins when he throws wine at John and ends with the tense armed duel, is also the beginning of the young Irishman's journey towards English high society. On this journey, we will fight alongside him and live each adventure alongside young Barry. Notice how Kubrick throws us into the fight when he faces a soldier in the army. The agitated camera, the sound of punches and the noise of people around create a very real atmosphere in the scene. It is also interesting to note how the aforementioned acidity is even more noticeable at this stage of Barry's life, as when the narrator says that the reasons for the war do not need to be explained, except by philosophers or historians. In reality, this excerpt is a criticism of the insanity of war. (""It's good to dream about a glorious war in an armchair at home. It's another thing to participate in it."").Barry Lyndon's furious attack on young Lord Bullingdon, captured with precision by Kubrick, triggers all the misfortunes that befall his life. The eminent English title he would achieve is lost, as is the family's stability. To make things worse, when giving his beloved son a gift, Barry ends up suffering the biggest loss of his life. Bryan's touching farewell scene begins the final sequence where Barry Lyndon's life will take its tragic and depressing fate. The reunion with Bullingdon will only close this cruel cycle in the Irishman's life. And his ending, alone, poor and weakened, does not match the interesting life he had.And if the viewer feels part of the narrative, it is also because of the good level of acting. Ryan O'Neal plays Barry Lyndon with subtlety, maintaining a mysterious and committed air in his obsession with reaching high society. Barry is smart, never failing to take the path that is advantageous to him, even if he has to lower himself to do so, as when he accepts to volunteer in the Prussian army. O'Neal also manages to convey emotion in dramatic scenes, such as his emotional crying when he loses his godfather, and especially when he loses his son Bryan. And the highlights don't stop there. From the moment that the exchange of glances between Barry and Lady Lyndon indicates the girl's interest, Marisa Berenson shows her quality as an actress, later expanded with the increasing suffering that the character will have to face, and reaching its high point in the loss of Bryan and in his suicide attempt. Among the rest of the efficient cast, Leon Vitali as Lord Bullingdon and Frank Middlemass as Sir Charles Lyndon stand out.Full of plans capable of taking anyone's breath away, this great work by the brilliant director also provides the viewer with an intriguing story, which follows the trajectory of a young dreamer until his complete transformation into what he hated most. It is comforting to know that over time the film has been honored and recognized as the great work that it is. As one of the most daring works of a director who went to space when science fiction was not viewed favorably in cinema and treated with the necessary austerity all the defects and dishonors of man, even suffering retaliation as a result. It is a work of art so peculiar that even though it is acclaimed for its aesthetic perfection and technical pioneering, it still needed to overcome time and criticism to prove itself as an avant-garde which, as a cinema, is a piece far beyond the whimsical daydreams of its maestro.",8.0,Anonymous,History
An Epic Undertaking!,"To say that it's a bit of a long one is an understatement. Be prepared to sit for a long time or to watch it in two sittings. I actually think a lot of it could have been shortened, especially the duelling towards the end. My only theory is that Kubrick was trying to set a new record for the longest film ever, especially as you get closer to the finish and it seems like there has been less and less editing.I won't say that it's a bad film, but I would have to think carefully about making such a timely investment to watch it again.It actually starts off quite well as an interesting tale of a boy with a need to get out and learn a few things, who goes to war and still doesn't really find his direction, but rather drifts along wherever the wind blows. When he finally meets Viscountess Lyndon you think that he is going to learn how to be a ""Proper"" man and settle down, but it doesn't really work like that and I found myself disliking the man he had become and losing interest quickly. This is when everything slowed down incredibly and it became a bit more 'Sense and Sensibility' with its romance and etiquette and a bit less 'Hornblower' losing the adventure and fight.It may be that I have seen too many 'Carry On' films, but this one seemed to have a comedic element to the way it was made. Michael Horden's narration made me think of the antics of 'The Wind In The Willows' and the Chevalier played by Patrick McGee looked just like John Cleese alongside Potzdorf who looked like Benny Hill. I was half expecting a bikini clad group of girls to start chasing around the fields or for Charles Hawtrey to pop up and say ""Hello"" in that camp old way.As with most films older than me, I would like to see a modern filmmaker give this a new treatment and hope that they would find something in the original Thackeray story that was missed in this version. I'm sure they could find lots of fat to trim at least, shortening it to something more easily manageable. It might even make a good TV series, broken down in to several episodes.Lastly, I have to say that Ryan O'Neal's Irish accent was horrible to listen to. Really cringeworthy.At least I can cross it off of my list of films to watch as recommended by the BFI (British Film Institute).",1.0,Anonymous,History

The Art of Film,"Perhaps the greatest film ever made, Barry Lyndon defies description in the usual sense that one may describe a film. That is, the plot is not really a plot; the cinematography is unlike anything you've ever seen; the music (arranged and conducted by Leonard Rosenman) is entirely authentic to the period; and the performances, especially that of Ryan O'Neal, set a mood rather than tell a story. (The fact that Mr. O'Neal was willing to turn in such an innocuous performance at the pinnacle of his career speaks volumes for the star's character.)The point of this film is not in the script, it's in the overall experience. If you try to view it as a movie, it will fail you (or rather the other way around). But if you approach it as a work of art-- a wonderfully detailed painting combined with a fantastic symphony, you will enjoy it immensely.As with all of Kubrick's films, don't expect entertainment. This is art. That is why it gets such wildly mixed reviews. Where most of today's filmed entertainment is the cinematic equivalent of rock-n-roll, Kubrick's films are mostly waltzes. If you go into them expecting a patient, moving experience you will enjoy them tremendously; and this one above all.Barry Lyndon is the definition of the Art of Film. The world of film is far poorer for the loss of Stanley Kubrick.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Mostly long and boring,"Seemed to go on forever. Then it finally ended. Someone in one of the critiques said Kubrick is overrated. I find his movies out and out arrogantly abstract. Like a foolish hen scratch of an oil painting that some fool pays a million dollars for. Just a bunch of junk that has little entertaining value to most. If it was actually good you would have probably heard of it or would see it more often. But, in reality no one wants to waste their time on this or 2001 for that matter.",3.0,Anonymous,History
"In my opinion, one of Kubrick's finest","After reading numerous reviews including Pauline Kael's unenthusiastic opinion, it amazed me that people have failed to realize the brilliance of this movie. I honestly never once found it boring. It swept me away. True, I've never read the book, which according to Kael is quick and fast paced, but I think Kubrick's subtle touch was like poetry. The subtle humor and the gorgeous music and photography gave the film both a gentle and ironic atmosphere.The acting was good for the most part. Ryan O'Neil could've been better.Marisa Berenson, I felt, was stunning and had a quiet and tragic aura about her. She didn't overdo it. The Reverend Runt reminded me of a scary, scary cat. He really added to the atmosphere.After Lolita, this is my favorite of Kubrick's. It's a beautiful film.",,Anonymous,History

More confirmation of Kubrick's extraordinary genius.,"I think that 'Barry Lyndon' is the film that really cements Stanley Kubrick's reputation into place among his most devoted fans. If he'd only made '2001' he'd still be considered a genius. Since he followed that with 'A Clockwork Orange' he moved up a notch to approach immortal status. But after making another 180 degree turn, taking on the historical novel/costume drama, and coming up with something this brilliant and stunning, well then, now was the time for deification. Has any director ever made three masterpieces in a row that were as different and as totally unique as these three?One of the most beautifully photographed of all movies, the film canvases Kubrick creates are glorious, interiors and exteriors alike. It almost seems then to be an embarrassment of riches for the film to have such an engrossing story and vivid characters as well. As is usually the case in the man's films, the movie itself is the star and the actors, no matter how well they perform, tend to be subordinate. In another director's hands, 'Barry Lyndon' might have been a star vehicle for Ryan O'Neal and Marisa Berenson. Certainly they both do adequate jobs here in the best roles of their careers, but they can't help but be a little overwhelmed by the whole. Good performances in the supporting roles often get overlooked as well, for example those by Leon Vitali and Hardy Kruger, to name just two.Many have heard about the miracle Kubrick performed by filming this movie using only natural light or candlelight, but knowing or not knowing that wouldn't increase or decrease the viewer's enjoyment of this film one bit. Though he made two more excellent films after this one (with one more still to come!), 'Barry Lyndon' to me stands as Stanley Kubrick's last undisputed work of genius. Well... maybe 'The Shining.'",10.0,Anonymous,History
"Barry Lyndon, underrated, but not justly so","Barry Lyndon seems to be one of Kubrick's least appreciated films in that it receives very little attention when compared to some of his other movies. I really don't think it should be so underrated, but there you have it.Barry Lyndon clocks in at just over three hours long and it is understandable why some people might find it too much to take in in one sitting. I had no problems with it and was utterly captivated by the film. It may be slow at times, but I found no moment boring at all.It's got great acting in my opinion and it really feels extremely authentic to me. Everything from the clothes and settings to the shots using candles as the only lighting. It just feels so...real.And of course, this is Kubrick so there is that unique beauty which only he could put into his films. That's basically what this film is: beautiful.This film, for me, is just massive, but it definitely isn't for everyone and that is the reason it isn't as well known as other Kubrick movies. However, for any Kubrick fan this is a must see and I really wish it were that way for everyone. But hey, to each his own.This movie isn't perfect, but it's pretty damn close. I give it a 9.5 leaning more towards a 10 and recommend this to any Kubrick fan and, really, to any movie fan in general. Even if you don't like it, it's worth watching.",9.0,Anonymous,History
"Opulent, Articulate, Masterwork","Simply put, Stanley Kubrick's Barry Lyndon is the most impeccable piece of film I have ever seen. There is an incredible sense of depth and care to every image in the film.  The quality of the imagery is absolutely perfect.  Kubrick also goes to great length to convey the dry nature of the world Redmond Barry roams.  To paraphrase Ferris Bueller, ""Everything is very cold and very beautiful.""I have heard many people call this film BORING.  That comment just means they have a short attention span.  This isn't a movie for the ""Fast and the Furious"" crowd. The characters are interesting and dynamic. The problem is, the world these characters inhibit isn't dynamic. It's static and Redmond tries and tries to fit in.  No matter what he tries, his fallacies draw out conflict in one form or another. The saddest of these is in the death of Redmond's son and the fall out with his wife and step-son.Barry Lyndon works on so many levels; technically, photographically, dramatically, and ultimately Artistically.  Even more amazing is how Kubrick turned a wordy busy novel into a quiet, powerful drama. This work is a reflection of the master status Kubrick deserves. A photographer who is obsessed with perfection in his images. And a filmmaker who is obsessed with cinema.  For me, Barry Lyndon is an unforgettable work of art.",10.0,Anonymous,History
A Sprawling Period Piece from Stanley Kubrick,"""Barry Lyndon"" is a three hour exposition into the life of an Irish commoner and social riser in 18th Century Europe. The film delves into great detail the events of his romantic youth through middle-age, and all the notable sidesteps along the way. The film depicts these happenings rather matter-of-factly, and doesn't cast bias one way or another on Barry (Ryan O'Neal). The viewer is free himself to decide whether they accept Barry as a gentleman ultimately, or merely a devious scoundrel.This is possibly the greatest period piece ever made, and another notch in the belt of cinema's finest director. Filmed in such a way as to present an aura of total authenticity, I almost felt as though I could have been watching a movie made in the 1700's. Kubrick's indelible presence could definitely be felt over this film, and you will never mistake his work for another's.The gentle pacing of this film may be lost on modern audiences hyped on CGI-porn, but there is a classic Kubrick moral woven within an elegant visual tapestry for those with the patience to bear it.",9.0,Anonymous,History

The movie is too long and therefore could not keep me interested the whole time. I mean the start was great and got me, but after that everything was slow and felt too long. That's very unfortunate considering that everything else was great. The length destroys the movie.And so I can only recommend you seeing it, if you are able to endure three hours of very slow storytelling.",4.0,Anonymous,History
Visual Perfection,"I may not be as eloquent in the phrases of film as some of the critics here, but I am no less passionate. I love just about everything Kubrick has done (Full Metal Jacket is lost on me, and Eyes Wide Shut took several viewings, and a recognition that Cruise has far less talent than Kidman and was probably mis-cast, to appreciate), but this is the jewel among his work. The film does not manipulate, but is the perfect visual equivalent of a book, or work of art: its sets the stage, and lets the rest take place in your mind. You take the long journey in, rejoice in the success, and writhe in pity at the decline and fall of the Redmond Barry dynasty. One writer talked about needing the ability to understand and appreciate the ""pregnant pause"", I think that sums it up. You have to surrender and let this film envelop you, it will not disappoint.I convinced a friend who managed an art film theater in Seattle to bring this film back in the early '80s. It was a major success. If it came out today it would most likely bomb from a commercial perspective.",,Anonymous,History
Beautiful Cinematography,"Barry Lyndon is a film often overlooked within the Kubrick filmography due to its serious and slow-paced undertones. It is these undertones, however that help to build up the film into a work of art that inspires possibly only the most devoted of film enthusiasts. This film should be viewed as many have suggested as such, an artistic portrayal of a period long romanticised, yet scarcely interpreted with such loyalty and devotion to the screen. Whilst Barry Lyndon remains among the greatest works of modern cinema, it is one, whose viewing must only be conquered by the most passionate of film-goers, if it is ever to be truly appreciated. It accomplishes that which few films are capable of, in bringing pure life onto the screen. Perhaps only rivalled by the select few other masterpieces of cinema, Kubrick's Barry Lyndon is a life epic, which leaves the viewer shaken and inspired. It is a film with the power to leave the viewer standing upon a whole new perspective of life, one which told through the neutral story of Redmond Barry provokes pure sorrow and depression within the heart of the viewer. This is not a movie to watch when you want to see a ""Shining"" or ""Full Metal Jacket"" type of action.....Barry Lyndon is a very detailed period story featuring all the peaks and setting pace of a book. This is a perfect movie to have an intermission with, to help you regroup and be engrossed in the story. THe dramatic highs (Jonathan Quinn duel, War, Gambling, Fight, and later duels) feature some of the finest work (Acting, camera work, directing) ever put on film. This movie took me 2 viewings or so to get, and I've seen it maybe 5-6 times now, and I can tell you, Barry Lyndon quickly moved up to the top of my movie list. It's a must see (at least twice). The acting is phenomenal, the movie is a labor of love, the cinematography is beautiful, the sets/lighting is amazing. It's hard to believe this movie is 30+ yrs old and is virtually unknown except to the Kubrick faithful. This is a MUST SEE!",8.0,Anonymous,History

"As with many Kubrick films, the use of light and music are fantastic.","I never thought that I'd be the sort of person to come out of a film raving about the use of light. But, to my surprise, after seeing Barry Lyndon, I am. As in most Kubrick films, the use of light is unbelievable. Almost every scene is so expertly and beautifully lit. Lighting is something you can usually ignore in a film, but after only a little examination of it in Barry Lyndon, you realise what a profound influence on the film it can have.Kubrick wanted this film to be as faithful to the era as possible, so he ordered that all of the costumes be meticulously designed in complete accordance with not only the techniques of the period, but the fabrics. As a result, they no longer look like costumes, but like clothes - it's a big difference.Also to make the film seem realistic, Kubrick used only natural/candle light. It makes sense if you think about it. There was no electric light at the time, yet in all other period films, that's how everything is lit up (as opposed to how it actually looked). The difference is phenomenal (just think how different the light is in a lit room compared to outside in the daylight). As a result, the actors aren't mercislessly covered in light, but bask in it.In one scene, set in a large hall, the set is lit up exclusively by candles - from chandeliers, from along the walls, from on the tables). In such indoor scenes, you've probably never seen actors' faces lit by anything other than overhead electric lights. Here, they are lit from the side with a much softer, orange light, and the effect is surprisingly refreshing. Due to the lack of intense brightness that candles produce in such a large room, Kubrick had to specially modify his camera. He took a camera that had not been manufactured anymore for years, broke it apart, and got NASA (!!!) to modify it for him. The result was a camera that had an f-stop (I think it was f-stop) that was higher than any cameras being used even today! And this was all just for one few-minute-long scene! And this insane perfectionism had serious results! The use of music in this film is about as breathtaking as I've ever seen/heard in any film - And I'm not usually a big fan of classical music! One scene (a crescendo-ing sequence of scenes actually) is, because of the way it is fit with music, one of the most profound and beautiful scenes I've ever seen. Fans of Martin Scorsese might be interested to see Barry Lyndon, because - if I'm not mistaken - this is Scorsese's favourite film.",9.0,Anonymous,History

What's luck go to do with it? Kubrick strikes again,"Don't let the powdered wigs fool you — ""Barry Lyndon"" is a Stanley Kubrick film through and through. To many it comes off as the filmmaker's period stepchild, but his hallmarks shine in this portrait-esque telling of an Irishman's rise and fall in social status at the hands of what can only be considered luck.This biographical epic derives from William Makepeace Thackeray's 19th Century novel loosely based on legendary Irish fortune-hunter Andrew Robinson Stoney. Published in serial form and then turned into a novel, Thackeray's tale is said to be one of literature's very first instances of an unlikeable hero.But Redmond Barry (Ryan O'Neal) wasn't always that way. In fact, it's not until Act II when he assumes the mantle of Barry Lyndon that he becomes a figure one might not be so inclined to root for. Even with his brazen ways in the beginning as he leaves Ireland and finds himself in both the British and Prussian militaries during the Seven Years War, you can't help but hope fortune looks kindly upon him after his early-life woes.Kubrick's lengthy telling of this tale allows us to see the complete rise and fall of Barry without skipping many beats. His pursuit of a wealthy lifestyle begins as a teenager when he falls in love with his cousin who ditches him for a wealthy military captain who will bring the Barry family lots of wealth. In a jealous rage, he challenges the man to a duel and kills him, forcing him to flee the area, but he finds out not much later that the ball was a dummy round of sorts. Redmond was set up so that the family could keep him out of the way of the marriage. At this point a Red Coat himself, he determines to climb his way to the top by any means necessary.Despite the period look, ""Barry Lyndon"" plays out more as an 18th Century fantasy adventure. Redmond is never in the same place for long until he marries Lady Lyndon (Marisa Berenson) at the start of the second act and his misadventures have a humorous bent to them. He finds himself in all kinds of predicaments and dealing with all manner of people. Instinct and luck lead him on a roller coaster that peaks at his achievement of wealth by marrying the Lady Honoria. Then, of course, it goes straight down.Guiding the film is an omniscient narrator who both foreshadows and offers keen insights, especially into the themes and ideas at play in the film. It also helps to frame the film as a portrait of a man's life. Kubrick's visuals echo this concept in the way he films every scene as if it's a painting. Only a few scenes, namely the more visceral ones in which there's fighting or something of that nature influences him to move his camera freely about. The technical aspects of the film are among the best of any of Kubrick's works. The costumes, cinematography and music create this moving tableau that keeps the film exciting even if a particular part of the story dulls momentarily.The performances are among the least memorable of Kubrick's films, but that's not to say they're poor. O'Neal has the challenge of always being 30 years old in real life but acting like Barry at different stages of his life. The blend between these stages lacks the necessary smoothness, but O'Neal excels at the all the emotional high points and finds ways to generate our sympathy in spite of Barry's inherent flaws.The rest of the cast either have or are made up with striking visual features. Kubrick and frequent casting director James Liggat find actors who really stand out, an important feature in both creating the tall-tale effect of the film but also in helping keep multiple characters separate in a time period in which conformity was the style. Murray Melvin as Reverend Runt, for example, has such a distinguished face that simply enhances the film. Of course it helps that Kubrick was a master of close-ups on faces.""Barry Lyndon"" shares some story characteristics with Kubrick's other films, namely in a man's transformation, a character or mankind's corruption, over time. Many of his works detail how war or violence ruins men, and while that's here too, it's told in a more biographical manner with an emphasis on luck and fortune or misfortune.What we discover at the latest by the film's one-sentence epilogue is that Kubrick didn't necessarily believe in luck's influence on the whole story, but he was nonetheless fascinated by how in this time period, the actions of men could be misconstrued as just luck one way or another. The social hierarchy, if you will, created a perception of powerlessness in one's own life to change social circumstances. Kubrick loads the film with innumerable scenes featuring duels and card games, but based on the outcomes, the characters involved always seem to make their own luck.Sure, ""Barry Lyndon"" could be considered the least commercially viable of Kubrick's films, but it is their equal as far as the director's mastery.~Steven CThanks for reading!

"oohs and aahs -- but no, uh, arc","A dead movie, like a dead language, can be an aggregate of exquisite details.'Barry Lyndon' is two movies with an intermission: 100 minutes to show the rise of an ambitious Georgian-era social-climbing Irish ruffian; 80 minutes to show his fall. The rise comprises his hard-scrabble youth and treacherous usurpation of aristocratic English privilege, the fall his comeuppance via the revenge of those he wronged.Nobody's sympathetic. Everybody's a scoundrel, a shallow heir or heiress, a toady, a soldier reduced to brutality by brutal treatment.A dead movie, like a dead body, can be exquisitely dressed, painted, and presented.Achingly beautiful images, unbelievable luminescence scene to scene. Life in the 18th century according to Kubrick was endless dullness in lovely landscapes, punctuated by war, duels, births and deaths, financial ruin, sociopolitical intrigue – and the occasional raging outburst. Kubrick breaks it down – every context for every upset of mundane life two hundred years past is painstakingly laid out. Nothing is a surprise. To be fair, Kubrick uses Brechtian title cards for each section, telling us this is what he intends to show us. But even Brecht made us feel for his protagonists, intended audience alienation effect notwithstanding. And Brecht astonished and surprised us. Kubrick gives these people something like a dry, old-school National Geographic anthropologic treatment – no small feat – but is it sustainable as a narrative film? One senses Kubrick was trying to give the audience a mimetic experience – the snail's pace and anti-dramatic structure of the film intended to let us live in the 18th-century for a few hours. It is a noble experiment . . . but it fails. It is impossible to engage with this film for very long.This viewer has not read the source novel by William Makepeace Thackery, but is highly doubtful the characters, or narrative point of view, lack a scintilla of wit – as is the case with Kubrick's film. No bawdy jokes, no farcical situations, no banter or games to see anybody through drudgery and war. Anybody living the life presented here would quickly die of despair or their own hand. I can understand not wanting to replicate, say, the rowdy romp of 'Tom Jones', but it is a mistake to direct actors to confuse a character's shallow exterior for a lack of inner life, or similarly exploit nonactors or actors of little depth -- that cultural pretense leads to amateur acting is hardly an original concept worth three hours beating over the head. No spontaneity here, no idiosyncrasy, no shared ensemble energy as a means to exponential discovery. It's as if Kubrick were trying so hard to avoid acting clichés – or was so cynical about the craft of acting – that he allowed no acting whatsoever; in other words, he attempted to perpetrate a grievous fraud: presenting the supremely titanic artifice of a commercial motion picture sans the artifice of accomplished acting technique.The title character is Ryan O'Neal, a huge American star in 1975 when this film was made. Sexy, earnest, milk-fed boy next door of limited range, used well in light romantic comedies. Kubrick casts O'Neal as something of a cypher, showing little to no emotional stake in the events of his character's life – but capable of great rage when provoked by an attack on his dignity. Otherwise there is no passion in the man.Marissa Berensen as the aristocrat Lyndon targets and snags is a striking fashion model, giving a striking fashion model's performance: the light, the camera love her to death. But a work of art should demystify a character such as hers. This film tells us she barely exists beneath the skin, yet continually thrusts her at us without revealing any information – to the point of annoyance. As with Berensen, Kubrick's use of O'Neil mystifies his character: we must accept that he is the archetypal social climber – and, for lack of much substantial information in the film, define him by preconceptions. Both are like cartoon or sitcom characters who go through dire situations yet barely register their effects. This makes for repetition, frustration, and, ultimately giving up on the film altogether.Kubrick's tight rein on lightweight O'Neal and novice Berensen is palpable, his artistic gun at their head barely outside the frame. The only actors allowed any room to play are Leonard Rossiter as a pompous military officer/jilted suitor, Patrick Magee as a high-stakes con artist all silk brocade and garish make-up over the small pox scars, and Murray Melvin's prissy tutor-priest. Rossiter was Kubrick's wonderfully sketchy Russian Ambassador in '2001: A Space Odyssey', Magee was Alex's obsessive main tormentor in 'A Clockwork Orange'. Melvin here is playing to type: he had a nice career interpreting crypto- and not-so-crypto gays through the 1960s and 70s (see 'The Devils' and 'A Taste of Honey').The movie won numerous awards for design, costumes, cinematography – and rightly so. Breathtaking visuals. Innovative technology allowed illumination of several scenes by candles alone. The early war sequences are consistent with Kubrick's career-long critique of that institution, and provide something of an apologia for a creature like O'Neil's protagonist, who decides marrying great wealth is the only antidote to a soldier's rotten life. That great wealth and its possessors only exist by perpetuating continual war is a strong theme of the film not lost on this viewer.'Barry Lyndon' is a work worth seeing because it is by a master, and it it is an odd creature indeed. It contains genius. But it is auteurism run amok.",5.0,Anonymous,History
This is the only Kubrik review I will ever do in IMDb.,"I consider Kubrik to be the greatest film director of them all.  I have seen every film of his starting from Killer's Kiss onward.  After tonight, the only film of his I have not seen at least twice is Killer's Kiss (which I had the good fortune to find playing in a film theatre only two blocks away from my hotel room in Paris).Barry Lyndon only confirms my beliefs.  Kubrik IS the greatest (sorry, Cassius).  Kubrik always respected my ability to interpret, to think and uncover, to rise to the challenge.The pacing of Barry Lyndon is intoxicating, taking its' time to explore what otherwise would be blink-and-miss at the hand of the majority of film directors, Russians like Eisenstein and Tarkovsky excluded.  The lighting and usage of musical score are in a Universe of their own, comparable to nothing else ever done, outside rank or classification.  The complexity of storytelling navigates in shades of grey, leaving as villains only circumstance and poor judgement by the characters involved, an approach sorely missed in MOST of modern cinema, where melodrama seems to be the order of the day.  While Barry Lyndon is a film with morality, it is by no means moralistic.In short, Barry Lyndon very much reflects real life, presented as a unique and grand cinematic experience.  My only regret is that I have not seen this film on a 90mm proyector screen, where it belongs.Thank you, Stanley.

Kubrick's Finest Film,"As big a fan of Stanley Kubrick as I am, I can find something flawed in each of his films save Barry Lyndon.  Where some see slow pacing and wooden characters, I see brilliant devices that Kubrick used in order to prevent the undermining of the purely sensory elements of this film.  Visually, it is unparalleled to this day, even by such recent masterworks as The English Patient or other classics such as Lawrence of Arabia.  The matching of the soundtrack to the action on film is so exquisite as to defy description, almost as if each frame of the the film is blended with each note of the music.  The performances, while understated, are still excellent, including leads Ryan O'Neal (Whom I do not like in any other movie) and Marisa Berenson as Lady Lyndon (The courtship scene between these two is perfect). Also, some of the more minor characters are very well portrayed, such as Captain Potzdorf, Lord Bullington and the Chevalier.This is quite simply Stanley Kubrick's finest film.  Yes, it is a large investment of time.  But if you choose to participate and let the film draw you in, those three hours are well spent.  And while it is not a traditional action movie, if the last duel scene doesn't draw you in and captivate you, you need to check your pulse.  It ranks right up there with the Dennis Hopper/Christopher Walken scene in True Romance as one of the greatest single scenes in the history of cinema.

One of Kubrick's BEST & certainly one of Ryan O'Neal's BEST pictures.,"Barry Lyndon is one of my favorite pictures of all time. I first saw it in the theatre when it was first released in early 1976.  I have recently purchased it on DVD.  Although I am generally not drawn to period costume dramas, the protagonist played by Ryan O'Neal is complex. While he is certainly a cheat, a liar, a deserter, and has many more negative qualities, he also displays LOVE, courage and compassion at times. Sometimes when you least expect it because you know what a thoroughly dishonorable scoundrel he is.  And since the movie is also a study of the times as much as a study of a man, I have thought for a long time that Kubrick should have simply titled the movie "" The Life and Times "", rather than the more cryptic "" Barry Lyndon "".",10.0,Anonymous,History
It is worth seeing for the duel alone,"I was watching TV one morning when Barry Lyndon came on the set. Because I missed the opening credits I didn't even know that Stanley had anything to do with this picture. In fact I though this picture was made in the mid 90's due to its spectacular photography. I was sucked into the movie and was captured by its very moment. I must say though, that the best scene in the whole movie is the duel between Barry and his stepson. I heard it took 42 days to edit this scene alone, and I must say it is worth it. The music and direction and fantastic. I was surprised to learn that Stanley directed this movie, since it was in such contrast to A Clockwork Orange.So I say see it, as it is pure art as a motion picture.",10.0,Anonymous,History

A Renaissance Painting Brought to Life by Stanley Kubrick,"Barry Lyndon is one of Stanley Kubrick's most visually sticking films. Kubrick masterfully uses blocking, color, framing and lighting to compose a number of shots throughout the film that resemble and look as if they were moving 18th-century paintings and the results are incredible with some shot's seeming like they should be framed and shown in an art gallery. The costumes, the makeup, the hair, the sets and locations and the sheer scale of the film make it seem like Kubrick has transported back in time to film his period piece. The story is well paced and although it has a run time just over three hours every scene serves a purpose to the overall narrative and the film never feels boring. That's not to say that some scenes can be quite slow at times but usually the film cuts to the next scene before it becomes irritating. The acting in the first half of the film is nothing much to admire but in the second act as Barry's life slowly goes downhill is when the performances really become interesting. Barry Lyndon is essential viewing for fans of period dramas and fans of Kubrick's work with the directors eye for incredibly detailed and precise shots being truly beautiful at times during the film.",9.0,Anonymous,History

A film for film makers,"This film is a landmark in cinematography for many reasons. First, the use of source lighting throughout the film - only natural light was used, no electrical lighting. Second, the absolute perfect framing of each and every scene, no matter how mundane. I defy anyone to step, frame by frame, through this film and see a single frame that could not be printed as a museum-grade image. It's that good. Exterior lighting was just as good as interior, with precise exposures matching the latitude of the film stocks available at the time.Many subsequent films have used source lighting (Amadeus comes to mind) with great results, but surely Kubrick was the first director to take this difficult production technique to this level. To achieve interior photography with nothing more than a few candles and perhaps some sunlight from a nearby window, Kubrick utilized a f0.7 lens developed by Perkin Elmer for spy satellite use. Cinema Products in Hollywood acquired this lens from Perkin Elmer and offered it to Kubrick after he inquired about very fast optics. CP modified a standard Mitchel BNC camera to accept this strange lens, building a special mount and grinding the aperture plate down to paper-thin thickness to permit the end element to focus on the emulsion on the BNC.One of the drawbacks of this special lens was an extremely shallow depth of field with wide open aperture settings. In the card gambling scene, shot entirely by candlelight, Kubrick had to instruct his actors to stay very still - not moving to or from the lens due to the focal length, which was 1 or 2 inches, maximum. It took many days and hundreds of takes to shoot the card scene, requiring the replacement of the candles every once in a while to maintain continuity.This is a film makers film - a film for photographers. While the story moves a bit slowly, the images captured are so well thought out and framed they overcome any shortcomings of the pace of the story. The use of classical music as a sonic background for the film was admirable, but this film is so well shot it stands above the soundtrack, like the finest silents of the 20's. The image is paramount.",10.0,Anonymous,History

A brilliant and luminous film with historical elements by the great master director Kubrick,"This is the evocative tale of a rogue who conned his way to the top and back again. At long last Redmond Barry became a gentleman -- and that was his tragedy. In the 18th Century, it takes much guile for an Irish lad without prospects to win the prestige and privileges of English nobility. It takes far more than guile to avoid losing them. In the opening scene, set in 1750s Ireland, the father of Irishman Redmond Barry (Ryan O'Neal) is killed in a duel by a businessman over a disputed sale of some horses. This detail is related by the film's narrator (the voice of Michael Hordern). The widow (Marie Kean), disdaining offers of marriage, devotes herself to the raising of her son. While still in his teens, Barry falls in love with his older cousin, Nora Brady (Gay Hamilton). Things go wrong when a wealthy English army officer named Captain John Quin (Leonard Rossiter) meets and begins courting Nora. Later on, Barry is recruited and his unit are sent to France to fight in the Seven Years' War (1756-1763) between the alliance of Great Britain and Prussia and the alliance of France, Austria and Russia. Then, while traveling up the Rhine River to the north on horseback, Barry meets a Prussian officer, Captain Potzdorf (Hardy Kruger) and is coerced to act as a spy. During a battle with French troops, Barry is promoted and receives a special commendation from the Prussian king, Frederick the Great. Some time later, at a gambling table in Spa, Belgium, he encounters the beautiful and wealthy Countess of Lyndon (Marisa Berenson).... After reaching the top, where can you go...except down?.Let those laugh that win -- while they can do either!.Upstart. Soldier. Hero. Deserter. Scoundrel. Opportunist. Family man. Adulterer. Ruffian. Pariah. Victim.A colorful and glamorous movies dealing with a peculiar roguish character, his adventures and misfortunes in which great was his rise and much greater his fall. Ravishing rendition of the classic Thackeray novel with a stunning display of history, but the end result still overwhelms. Concerning the adventures of an Irish gambler moving from innocence to self-destructive arrogance in the aristocracy of 18th Century England. A triumph of technique over any human content that takes Thackeray's hero and traces his rise and fall through the armies and high societies of 18th century Europe. Given the lack of singular intense drama, perspective or insight, the way of the movie looks becomes its main defence. Visually opulent with magnificent visuals, adding gorgeous cinematography by cameraman John Alcott showing the green fields bathed in the melancholy of Irish tunes, though the constant array of waxworks figures against lavish backdrops finally vulgarises the total sumptuousness. Kubrick received awesome interpretations from all his actors, Ryan O'Neal has seldom been better, along with Marisa Berenson. And a competent support cast, such as: Patrick Magee, Hardy Krüger, Steven Berkoff, Gay Hamilton, Marie Kean, Diana Körner, Murray Melvin, André Morell, Arthur O'Sullivan, Godfrey Quigley, Leonard Rossiter, Philip Stone, Leon Vitali, among others.It contains the typical sadness of Irish tunes from Paddy Moloney , Sean Potts, Sean O'Riada, performing The Chieftains ; and including the irruptions of sounds of The Barber of Seville (cavatina) or Mozart, Schubert or Vivaldi, Harpsichords and adagio
composed by Johann Sebastian Bach and Sarabande by Händel . The picture was finely acted, compellingly made and supremely directed by Stanley Kubrick. His film debut was ¨Fear and desire¨ 1953 , a not very successful Kubrick movie, belonging to his early period when he made black and white, low budgeted flicks as the Film Noir: ¨Killer's Kiss¨, ¨The Killing¨ and continuing with one of the best wartime pictures:¨Paths of Glory¨ produced and played by Kirk Douglas. As Kirk hired Kubrick to direct the blockbuster epic ¨Spartacus¨. Following the polemic film: ¨Lolita¨ with James Mason, Sue Lyon. And going on three hits in Sci-Fi and Dystopian genre as ¨Dr Strangelove or how I learned to stop worrying and love the bomb¨, ¨2001 a space odyssey¨ , ¨A Clockwork Orange¨. In 1975 directed this great costumer movie ¨Barry Lyndon¨ with Ryan O'Neal , Marisa Berenson. And other genre movies as the terror in ¨The Shining¨ based on Stephen King novel and a warfare film: ¨Full Metal Jacket¨. And his last one : ¨Eyes Wide Shut¨ with big name stars as Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman. Rating : 8/10 . Above average . The film wil appeal to Stanley Kubrick enthusiasts.",8.0,Anonymous,History
"""Tom Jones"" Done Right...","Hard to imagine that the utterly dreadful 1960s version of ""Tom Jones"" won Best Picture, while ""Barry Lyndon"" did not...  This film was slammed by the critics when it came out (""Slow!"" ""Boring!""  ""Ponderous!"") but the critics were wrong...I didn't see ""Barry Lyndon"" until a year or so ago, but was fortunate to see it in a theatre, the second half of a double feature with ""The Duelist"" (another excellent film, by the way.)  I mention the circumstances, because... despite BL being 3 hours long, and coming after another movie that ran over two hours, at the intermission point, I found myself thinking, ""Intermission?  Already?  But that could only have been about an hour...""Add on top of this another detail: I loathe Ryan O'Neal -- yet was compelled by his performance here...Finally, this little double-feature fest came at the end of a l-o-o-o-ong work day, but I was wide awake and fully alert at the end of ""Barry Lyndon.""Why?  Because Kubrick managed to stuff every scene with full emotional impact, and there's a dueling scene late in the film that has such excruciating emotional stakes, it's utterly heartrending -- managed, by the way, with the entire thing shot from an apparently passive, far away wide-angle, locked-down camera, at a very leisurely pace.  Nod to Kubrick's genius -- he does everything in the scene to alienate the audience from what's happening, and yet we're glued to it, gripping our seats, hoping that what happens won't happen, heaving a collective groan of pain when it does.And, on top of all that, the entire film was shot only with light sources available within the period it takes place -- i.e., candles, candles, candles, or the sun.  It was a bold experiment in the early days of fast film, and it works; moreso than almost any film set in the period, we are there.  (The only thing that gets close that I can think of off hand is ""Revolution,"" the underrated Al Pacino venture from the early 80s -- but it derives its ""you are there"" from historical accuracy and detail.)Anyway, this is all the long way about of saying that ""Barry Lyndon"" is worth a second look, and a third -- and definitely a first if you've never seen it.  Don't let the length scare you, because the story will grab you so fast, you won't notice.  Don't let Ryan O'Neal scare you, because everything unlikeable about him works to the advantage of the story here...And, finally, for you ""Clockwork Orange"" fans -- watch carefully, my droogies, because the structure of ""Barry Lyndon"" mirrors the structure of ""A Clockwork Orange"" perfectly -- and yet tells us an entirely different tale.",10.0,Anonymous,History

Watch the Paint Dry,"Out of shiny fresh apples, esteemed filmmaker Stanley Kubrick takes a metaphorical lemon and paints it red. He uses only the finest and most exquisite paints available and calls his lemon ""Barry Lyndon"". As you would expect, Mr. Kubrick makes the Lyndon lemon look extraordinarily beautiful. Still, when you look at it for over three hours, you realize it's only an ordinary lemon. Cutting through the outer beauty, you find the lemon sour, overripe and choked with unyielding seeds. A few seeds are well-cast, though. Leon Vitali (as Lord Bullingdon) is one. You will have to wait, but Mr. Vitali does appear before Godot. There are scenes that reach perfection, like those with Lyndon's mother Marie Kean and the Reverend Murray Melvin.

"As with all Kubrick movies we're dealing with a cold, detached story of a man searching for his own identity.","Very much a film of two halves, the first chronicling the rise of Redmond Barry, and the second dealing with the fall of the now appointed Barry Lyndon.  This is a similar structure device applied by Kubrick, notably in A Clockwork Orange and later in Full Metal Jacket, both of which depicted the long development process of an individual at odds with his society and surroundings.  The parallels between Barry, Alex and Private Joker are staggering, from the cynicism and underhanded intelligence, they each, somehow manipulated their way from common rogue, to a character with reasonable standing within the structural society of the film.The second Act is by far the strongest part of the film, because it is by this stage that we begin to feel empathy for Barry, but it is also the part of the film, which differs greatly from those other Kubrick masterpieces. For example, A Clockwork Orange showed our hero return to his murderous ways, cured by the state that originally imprisoned him for his crimes, whereas Full Metal Jacket showed the platoon soldier on, in both instances we got the impression that the film may be over for us but the characters had a long way to go.  This isn't the case with Barry Lyndon.  Although it may be argued that Barry's ""luck of the Irish"" lifestyle may still have some excitement left in it, there is the feeling that we have all ready been privy to the best part, that no matter what happens next for him will not reach the same unbelievable fortune and misfortune that has followed him through the course of the film.Kubrick plays with notions of loyalty, love, power, deceit, war, honesty and nobility with Barry Lyndon, never allowing the film to flag or become tiresome.  As much a film of technicality as it is performance (as with all Kubrick), it was to be the film that would set the visual staple for subsequent period films The Dualists, Dangerous Liaisons and Amadeus. Kubrick's approach to filming in Barry Lyndon is like filming renaissance paintings, employing the long zoom in's/zoom out's to show us the necessary information, never merely cutting away to an object.  This is so rare nowadays, with cuts in films getting quicker and quicker, Kubrick manages to condense everything of importance of those times (fashion, architecture, music) and fill every corner of the frame, and the recurring theme of Handel's Sarabande is hauntingly evocative.The performances are strong, given Kubrick's standing as a visual film-maker, with Ryan O' Neil giving a fine performance, along with Leonard Rossiter, Patrick Magee, Marisa Berenson, and Leon Vitali ensures that acting is of the same calibre as the cinematography, and O' Neil giving the standout of his career (even with the accent).  An overwhelmingly beautiful film that should rank amongst Kubrick's greatest, which has somewhere along the lines been sadly forgotten.  With a deep emotion and wonderful moments, Kubrick's film version of Barry Lyndon has that rare power to restore the love of film-making to any jaded film fan.  10/10",10.0,Anonymous,History
Interesting,"I saw this movie for the first time when I was 12. I found it drab, dull, boring, pointless, and any number of adjectives meaning boring. The only things that stuck in my head was the use of Handel's ""Sarabande"" and that I felt that Bullingdon was poorly treated. Recently I saw the movie again. What a difference nine years makes! The story was much more comprehensible and felt rather like ""Tom Jones"" without the convoluted ending. I particularly enjoyed the setting of late 18th- early 19th century Ireland. The story reads like an 18th century novel, in fact besides Thackeray's 19th century novel there are dozens of novels that follow the rises and falls of the scapegrace lads. There was only one disappointment with watching it again and that was finding that Bullingdon was really a pain in the butt. Chalk my feelings of sympathy up to some weird thing for Leon Vitale.There is one thing that this movie excels in and that is music. The way that Handel's ""Sarabande"" weaves its way in and out of the last 30 minutes of the film is truly beautiful. It can create tension or simply convey a stately grace. There is also the constant use of Schubert's Piano Trio, if I am not mistaken, which lends a feeling of continental refinement. Kubrick may have had some trouble connecting the audience with his films, but his matching music with what is on screen is unparalleled in my mind.",10.0,Anonymous,History

And while that movie is widely remembered and discussed about to this day, it really is a shame people don't remember this movie as well as they do other Kubrick masterpieces, such as 2001, The shining, or A clockwork orange. On one hand I get it, this movie isn't as compelling as the others, the deeper meaning isn't really there, and overall its message simply doesn't present the same level of complexity as the aforementioned movies.

Like some of Kubrick's other work, Barry Lyndon fails to capture the imagination of the audience with writing and characters, but leaves it all up to the prettiness of the film.  Give me a break!

An Unique Masterpiece,"I saw this film in theatrical release when it first came out. I was stunned that it garnered mediocre reviews. I keep returning to the film to learn more about story, direction, and cinematography.A recent book critical of American art and culture (by a, shall we say, conservative cultural warrior) posed the question ""What work of art of the past 50 years will be remembered 500 years from now?"" The questioner, and the editorialist who quoted the question were taking aim at Quentin Tarantino. Well, ""Pulp Fiction"" will be remembered, and so will everything produced/directed by Stanley Kubrick. And of all of his films, this one is my favorite.The choice of the novel by Thackery as source material was brilliant. But Kubrick took it a step further by adopting an attitude flavored by Balzac and de Maupassant, although not as cynical. Rather, it is a work of naturalism, deliberately heightened by the Kubrick's signature geometrical camera direction, and his use of natural light.Every serious lover and student of film-making must see this movie, and see it again, and again.

Redmond goes to England with the purpose of getting married with a wealthy, future-ensurer woman, and he accomplished his mission by marrying with Mrs. Lyndon, a rich and beautiful widow. From that moment on, Redmond was known as Barry Lyndon. The relationship was prestigious but loveless, and the friendship between Barry and Mrs. Lyndon's son was non existent. They conceived a child named Brian, and as time passed by, Barry was becoming a selfish, greedy person each time more, contrary of what he was like in his youth: brave and always honest. Because of a terrible accident, 9 year-old Brian died and Barry along with his wife went on a terrible depression, followed by a serious economic crisis. Mrs. Lyndon's older son challenged him to a duel, which was won by the young man (destroyed Barry's leg). He ended expelling Barry and his mother from the family and they returned to Ireland, where he probably ended the same way as he started: poor and unsatisfied. The brilliantness of another era's representation and costumes gets together with the well-known ability that Kubrick had to show human feelings and its issues to make a masterpiece.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Lyndon Falling,"I've read some Thackeray in my time and may in fact have digested the parent novel many years ago. Either way, I don't doubt it was a doorstop of a book so I easily get this Kubrick movie running for over three hours and indeed containing an intermission.I'm not one of those who worship at the altar of Saint Stanley, however. I like his earlier movies like ""The Killing"" and ""Paths of Glory"" and isolated later ones ""The Shining"" and ""Eyes Wide Shut"", but just didn't get ""Dr Strangelove"" or ""2001"". ""Barry Lyndon"" sits almost exactly halfway in his career and coincidentally leaves me about halfway in my appreciation of it.Due respect is paid to the source with Michael Hordern's intermittent narration prodding the story along while the time and place of the Georgian setting is wonderfully created in locations, settings and costumery, not to mention the apposite choices of accompanying classical music pieces throughout.Somehow though I didn't connect with the characters paraded in front of me. The main suspect is Ryan O'Neal In the title role of the young Irish adventurer, not a naturally expressive actor and it doesn't help that he occasionally parks his would-be Irish accent back across the Atlantic. He's helped out considerably by a phalanx of British and Irish character actors no doubt used to dressing, powdering and wigging-up in the Restoration manner, but even they can't conceal the vacuum at the film's heart.Of course, his defenders will always make excuses for Kubrick's art, no doubt stating that the distance he puts between his camera and his characters is deliberate, but it too often felt like they were cardboard cut-outs being moved across a board while the real attraction for the director was in the cinematography, which is undeniably stunning.In the end, I didn't feel drawn enough into the story to really care what happened to Master Lyndon and that too many scenes were just too long, deadening their dramatic impact. In the end while there are shots in this film I will remember, there were few scenes I will later recall.So that's my verdict, technically brilliant but emotionally lacking. It's like one of the Sir Joshua Reynolds paintings of the period, fine from a distance but get too up-close and you can see the flaws.",5.0,Anonymous,History
Easily Worth A Thousand Viewings,"Some people may complain about the slower pacing of ""Barry Lyndon"". They are missing the point : this film is not about moving from plot point A to plot point B in the most efficient way possible - you want that, go see a Ron Bass movie.""Barry Lyndon"", unlike many movies which trip all over themselves to twist the audiences expectations, does take it's time; but it is for the journey that we must embark. Every character, every set, every line of dialog, every frame has been touched by a craftsman unequaled in his lifetime. From the highly detailed production design to the flowery, and at times, comical dialog Kubrick has created a true vision of life in aristocratic Europe. Everything in this movie is perfect. It could almost be a documentary.But instead of celebrating the chivalry and heroism of the period, Kubrick peels away the layers of legend to reveal the true nature of kings and generals. He satirically castigates royalty and soldiers alike as petty and decadent rogues, who pay lip service to honor while stealing all they can to support their lifestyle (or ""the manner with which they'd become accustomed""). And Barry, being from humble roots, is all too eager to play the game in exchange for a place at the table.The film is both a literary and visual masterpiece. The former is likely due to the abilities of W.M. Thacker who wrote the book upon which the movie was based. Only a novel could be so rich in detailed subplot while maintaining it's overall theme. The latter, is all Kubrick - always a visual genius, the man invented a new lens system so he could film the whole thing with natural light. Amazing. At certain points in the movie, you will be wondering if that river or meadow in the background is a matte painting or if, in fact, a place that scenic does indeed exist.I've seen the movie three or four times, I watch key scenes over and over again. To me, it's one of the funniest movies ever made. The fact that Kubrick, with his dedication to truth and reality and meaningful storytelling, directed it, also makes it one of the best",10.0,Anonymous,History
Philosophical and absolutely awe-inspiring.,"Stanley Kubrick's creative vision on 1975's Barry Lyndon is clearly out of the mind of a genius; the film looks and almost (note almost) acts like it was a painting, the camera is placed thoroughly as a long-shot in which the audience overlooks the events with just as much attention on the beautiful landscape in the background or the brilliant period detail put down to work here, as on the actual actions going on; and the actual actions is the rise and fall of Redmond Barry, three hours of ups and downs that spans itself over years and naturally acts like an epic biography. And the useful narrative voice-over keeps up with the story, because to me it seems as if Kubrick was just as much interested in telling the story with eyes for the gorgeous, idyllic and detailed, as he was to letting us under Barry Lyndon's skin - something we somehow really don't. No other than Kubrick could have done this with such a elegant pace or artistic self-awareness.And somehow these costume-dramas tend to put most of its ambition in its production design - but few really tend to succeed with combining this with an interesting storyline. Sofia Coppola's 'Marie Antoinette' was a fresh breath and new-take at this genre, but it flawed in its narration, especially towards the end - Barry Lyndon never flaws. It's slow but surprisingly entertaining rhythm seems to capture you right off the start, and the dazzlingly beautiful shots of both interior and exterior locations are Kubrick's most gorgeous. Barry Lyndon is like a moving painting - and feels like a three-hour gorgeous experience of a man whose principals in life is to have a continuous development and progression, and with this comes success and failure.",10.0,Anonymous,History

I'm not taking about special effects (this is anything but an ""action"" flick).  I'm talking about capturing true beauty beautifully on film.  But Kubrick accomplishes much more with his period piece than brilliant cinematography.  He places the viewer *into* the eighteenth century.  You are living it.  The pace of the film is (almost painfully) slow at times but, you see, so was the life of the times.  Many scenes offer the viewer no dialogue at all because this was a time when the gesture, the look, the subtle formality communicated far more than the spoken word.

Pure Kubrick,"I was really surprised at how much I ended up liking this movie, I watched it recently, and my mindset going into it was was ""well, it'll be well-photographed and have the usual interesting Kubrick thematics, but it'll probably feel kinda long, and you probably won't have a big urge to rewatch it anytime soon, sort of like Eyes Wide Shut"".  Thankfully, I was wrong, I wouldn't call the 18th century costume drama my favorite type of film, but I found this one to be very absorbing.  Even though it's a bit over three hours long, it never feels ""slow"" or ""boring"", there's a lot that goes on in it.  Like all Kubrick films, there's a lot of different layers to it, and you probably have to watch it more than once to get everything out of it.  The famous duel scene toward the end of the film is one of the best I've ever seen, right up there with the climax of The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly (even though they couldn't be much more different).  The more ominous ""duel version"" of the film's main theme that starts before the actual duel and goes on for what feels like about 20 minutes (I didn't time it) works almost like the audio equivalent of Chinese water torture and helps to bring the tension to a nearly unbearable level.

The best film of all time,"Stanley Kubrick's Barry Lyndon is not just a film; it's a cinematic experience that transcends time. This 1975 period drama is a work of art, meticulously crafted to perfection, earning its rightful place among the greatest films ever made. Every element of the film, from its visual grandeur to its storytelling depth, exudes mastery.Cinematography: A Visual SymphonyKubrick's Barry Lyndon is a feast for the eyes. The cinematography, helmed by John Alcott, is nothing short of breathtaking. Kubrick employed natural light and candlelight to recreate the 18th-century settings, making every scene feel like a living painting. The use of long, slow zooms and meticulously composed wide shots imbue the film with a sense of stillness and beauty. The cinematography is almost painterly, often drawing comparisons to the works of classical artists like Gainsborough and Watteau. Each frame is a masterpiece in its own right, creating an immersive visual experience that remains unparalleled.Acting: Subtlety and Nuance in Every PerformanceRyan O'Neal's portrayal of the titular character, Redmond Barry, is perfectly understated, reflecting the character's complex evolution from an opportunistic Irish rogue to a man lost in the coldness of aristocratic life. O'Neal brings a quiet intensity to the role, capturing Barry's ambition, vanity, and eventual downfall with precision. Marisa Berenson, as Lady Lyndon, provides a nuanced performance, subtly conveying the emotional weight of her character's tragic life. The supporting cast, from the cunning Lord Bullingdon (Leon Vitali) to the scheming Captain Quin (Leonard Rossiter), enhances the narrative with memorable, layered performances.Storytelling: A Tragic Tale of Ambition and DeclineKubrick's adaptation of William Makepeace Thackeray's novel The Luck of Barry Lyndon is a rich exploration of ambition, class, and human frailty. The narrative structure, divided into two acts, mirrors the rise and fall of Redmond Barry. Kubrick's use of an omniscient narrator adds a layer of detachment, presenting Barry's exploits as both inevitable and ironic, with a dark sense of humor woven throughout. The film's slow pacing is deliberate, allowing the audience to fully absorb the emotional and psychological depth of each scene. It is a film that requires patience but rewards those willing to engage with its subtleties.Music: The Perfect AccompanimentThe musical score in Barry Lyndon is a masterclass in how music can elevate a film. Kubrick's choice of classical pieces, such as Handel's Sarabande and Schubert's Piano Trio in E-Flat, adds a haunting elegance to the narrative. The music never overwhelms the film but complements its tone, heightening the sense of tragedy and grandeur. The use of period-appropriate compositions further immerses the audience in the 18th-century world, reinforcing the film's historical authenticity.Production Design and Costumes: Authenticity in Every DetailThe production design and costumes in Barry Lyndon are nothing short of spectacular. Every detail, from the ornate interiors of the aristocratic mansions to the military uniforms and ball gowns, is painstakingly authentic. The film transports viewers into the world of 18th-century Europe with stunning accuracy. Kubrick's insistence on historical fidelity is evident in every aspect of the film's design, creating an immersive and believable world.Themes: A Study in Human NatureAt its core, Barry Lyndon is a meditation on the human condition. Kubrick explores themes of ambition, fate, and the transient nature of power and success. Barry's rise to fortune is fueled by his relentless desire for status, but his eventual downfall is a poignant reminder of the fragility of such pursuits. The film's final line, stating that all the characters are now equal in death, is a sobering reflection on the futility of earthly desires and social status.Conclusion: A Timeless MasterpieceBarry Lyndon is a film that grows richer with every viewing. It is a triumph of filmmaking, where every element - from the flawless cinematography and exquisite performances to the profound storytelling - comes together to create an unforgettable experience. Stanley Kubrick's meticulous attention to detail and visionary direction make this film an enduring masterpiece.This is not just a movie; it's a work of art that deserves its place in cinema history. For its boldness, its beauty, and its brilliance, Barry Lyndon stands tall as a 10/10 film.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Overlooked Gem,"When you think of Kubrick, what do you think of?  Strangelove?  Clockwork? Shining?  If you are like most people, you don't think about Lyndon.  That's a shame.  Because it is every bit as magnificent, splendid, and powerful as anything else in his canon.The true genius of Kubrick, according to Spielberg, is that he never made the same film twice.  Because of this, comparing one Kubrick film to another is a tricky situation.  It also means that, for just about everyone, there is going to be a Kubrick film that just doesn't do it for you.  [If there's such a one for me, I haven't found it yet.]  Kubrick didn't make very many films, all things considered, but he managed a breadth most directors will never reach.""Barry Lyndon"" is Kubrick's foray into the costume drama.  It is the most realistic such film I've ever seen.  I don't mean that the story, plot, or characters are realistic (certainly they are, but there are loads of costume dramas realistic in that sense), but the cinematography, through Kubrick's innovative use of light and specially constructed lenses, makes this film look utterly remarkable.  I really feel as if I'm watching things that are actually happening.Ken Adam did the production design on this film (as he had done on ""Dr Strangelove""), and once again he scores a triumphant victory.  Also the costumes, the locations.  Every visual element of the film is a remarkable achievement, and would make this film worthy of the highest praise.So why has the film become such a curiosity?  Why are otherwise film-literate people, who are intimately familiar with many of Kubrick's other films, totally unaware of ""Barry Lyndon""?  Apparently, the story isn't very good.  Well, that's what I gather from reading the other reviews here. The story isn't very good.  It's boring and too long.Too long.  Of all the things anyone has ever said about a film, ""too long"" annoys me the most.  As if length were a primary characteristic of a film. It's not.  Length is simply of function of what the director has chosen to include in the film, and the pace.  Certainly, ""Barry Lyndon"" has a very slow pace.  But I consider this a strength.  Like ""2001"", ""Barry Lyndon"" tells its story through a very different narrative approach.  The basic story is extremely simple.  If you read a transcript of the narration and dialogue, you would see the simple, skeletal framework of the plot.  And for a 3 hour film, it is a very thin framework.  But because the pace is so slow, Kubrick enables the actors to convey a far more complicated palette of emotions than the thin story would otherwise allow, and they convey these emotions through  superb subtlety.  A long look, and pensive sigh...  A ten second shot of Lady Lyndon with Lord Bullingdon in her arms, perfectly still, unchanging expression.  These shots, these ""long"", ""boring"", ""pointless"", shots reveal so much more about the story and the characters than our hypothetical transcript ever could.But why choose such a way as that to reveal the full depths of the story? Because Kubrick was a film-maker.  Any given story can be told in any number of ways.  As Kubrick was telling this particular story (one which had already been told in novel form) in cinematic form, he chose to rely, in so far as possible, on purely cinematic tools.  Dialogue is common to film, radio, and prose.  But the effect of that glorious shot of Lady Lyndon and Lord Bullingdon, which is only one of so many beautifully composed shots dripping with emotion, could not have been communicated in any other medium.That is why Kubrick is such a great filmmaker.  He understood the unique tool he had in the medium of film and he shared its power.  He stripped this film of as much as he could that is not unique to film, and left us with a glimpse at what film, and only film, is capable of bringing to the art of narrative fiction.Also, the film has a wonderfully dry, ironic wit which is all too often overlooked.",9.0,Anonymous,History
One of the most beautiful films of Kubrick,"I got the chance to watch this film in a beautiful 35mm print in Paris. I was hit by a wave of emotions, colors and almost perfect camera movements. I believe that with this film you can really notice the mastery of Kubrick.
People tend to talk a lot about 2001: A Space Odyssey or about A Clockwork Orange, or even about Full Metal Jacket, but I think Barry Lyndon is his most visually beautiful film alongside with 2001: A Space Odyssey, the problem with this last movie of his, is that is so profoundly important in film history that it is so hard not to say that it is his most important work.
Personally the film of Stanley that I love the most is Eyes Wide Shut, the most important from him is 2001: A Space Odyssey, but the one that I think is his masterpiece and the one with which he showed his search for perfection, has to be Barry Lyndon.",10.0,Anonymous,History

They are all equal now,"Kubrick truly transports the viewer to the 18th century with this impeccably shot, very thoughtful film. It follows the life of a young Irishman, which fate has fighting in the armies of several countries before he's able to marry a rich widow. Through this character's example the film seems to be showing just how random life is, with precarious turns of events leading to entirely new chapters, as well as how foolish people are, fighting duels or marching to their deaths in senseless wars. Lyndon robs others and is robbed, he loses and wins fortunes, and he acts as a scoundrel and as someone with grace. Unfortunately the lead role is played by Ryan O'Neal, who is a weak link in an otherwise superb cast; his uneven (often non-existent) accent is awful, and he fails to give the character a sense of swagger. His character is not very sympathetic either, but a scene where fate is especially cruel is still devastating. And in the end, we see that regardless of our scurrying about, ultimately we pass away and become equals in death:""It was in the reign of George III that the aforesaid personages lived and quarreled; good or bad, handsome or ugly, rich or poor they are all equal now.""",8.0,Anonymous,History
Bizarre.,"Kubrick was a masterful director. I personally adore both 2001 and The Shining - as close to cinematic perfection as you can come - and there is a lot to admire in the style and controversy of A Clockwork Orange, too. However, even the greatest directors make mistakes, and this was Kubrick's second (his first being Lolita). This lavish period piece telling of the exploits of 18th Century Irishman Barry Lyndon has little to recommend it beyond the helmer's name.Technically, there is some accomplished work in terms of composition of shot and the deliberate imitation of a past style of painting. As a film, though, Barry Lyndon is a variously tortuous and unrewarding watch - there are entertaining moments here and there, and nothing stands out as obviously bad, but neither does anything stand out as obviously great. It is as mediocre an experience as you could ask for - and running at close to three hours mediocre is not exactly called for. To say that it starts well and ends less well does not very well do it much of a service.But what do we ask of great directors? We ask for profundity, passion, insight, vision and excellence. None of these qualities are at all present in Barry Lyndon, a film without much point or energy, which is, in the end, overblown and rightly overlooked by the majority of film fans. Viewers looking for a Kubrick masterpiece would do well to avoid this one.",4.0,Anonymous,History
A true work of art,"Kubrick is one of the few true cenematic artists. The screen is his canvas, the camera his brush and his direction the brush strokes. Barry Lyndon is, in reality, a series of oil paintings, made apparent by the perfect natural lighting and the way the camera holds each exposure...as though through the lens of a Konica. Each one you'd swear belongs in a gallary. This necessarily drags the movie down to a slow walk...but if you'll just sit back, turn down the lights, and sip your favorite beverage...slowly...and develop a 'gallary' mindset as you watch this film (preferrably on a DVD), you'll absolutely love it.",,Anonymous,History

"Barry Lyndon is a piece of art and an unforgettable experience, an achievement in cinematography, but is it entertaining? Not really, yet it doesn't need to be","What's the first thing I thought about before watching Barry Lyndon? The gorgeous and perfect cinematography where every frame is like a painting, that's about what I knew about it before my friend at film studies told me more about it. The scale of this film, the vision Stanley Kubrick had for it, if you can call something a masterpiece then this is it. I rate this film high because of it being an art film, the pacing is extremely slow and the story doesn't have that extra amount of heart poured into it, coming out as a film which lacks real emotion at times. With that said, I think if you go into this film knowing it's slow paced and you have the energy to sit down to watch it, I'm sure you'll love it. I did! It's an achievement in cinema in a way, Kubrick directed a film with frames which will be remembered for decades more and possibly centuries. Every frame is like a painting, it's actually based on William Hogarth paintings. The dialogue and what happens in the scenes is not as memorable, as it's the visual storytelling which is perfect here. Stanley Kubrick adapted and told a fascinating story, a truly great one.An Irish rogue wins the heart of a rich widow and assumes her dead husband's aristocratic position in 18th-century England.The actors, main to supporting and even smaller roles. There are so many performances which are just perfect and something a critic wrote which I could only agree on, ""makes you realise that the most undervalued aspect of Kubrick's genius could well be his way with actors."", and that couldn't be more true. From how Stanley Kubrick directed the actors to how he chose them, these actors probably researched the time period as well. Every single detail in their performances is just perfect. Ryan O'Neal portrays the title character with such perfection.The film's cinematography was overseen by director of photography John Alcott (who won an Oscar for his work), and is particularly noted for the technical innovations that made some of its most spectacular images possible. To achieve photography without electric lighting, they shot it with candlelight which had to be a difficult thing to do. What we got was something truly mesmerizing, beautiful and simply perfect. There's much to say about the cinematography, the length Stanley Kubrick and John Alcott went to create each shot. The special ultra-fast lenses which made it possible to shoot in natural light (candle lit rooms for example), then we have the camera angles used; long double shot, with a slow backwards zoom. If a scene is shot with a close up or longer, it zoomed out which made us see everything like a painting and easier to notice the attention to detail which was put into the film. The mise-en-scene is truly perfect in Barry Lyndon, the cinematography is groundbreaking. The musical score is brilliant and important for the film's many shots which resembles paintings, making us feel even more immersed in the time period, and making it more dramatic. I've said how the direction and cinematography are brilliant, let me get into the writing; Kubrick based his adapted screenplay on William Makepeace Thackeray's The Luck of Barry Lyndon, but made a couple of changes to it, all welcomed changes I would guess (as I haven't read the novel). There's nothing wrong about the writing, the dialogue and plot are spectacular, its slow pacing hurts the plot though along with the over-reliance of the voiceover. This makes the film not that entertaining, but that's quite alright. I went into this film knowing it would be a piece of art, I wasn't disappointed. It's a brilliant film with some terrific and nicely executed themes; Fate and destiny, but also father and son. As Roger Ebert says, ""He is a man to whom things happen."" Barry just can't escape his fate, as what happens to him happens for a reason, his destiny. Barry Lyndon received seven nominations at the 48th Academy Awards, including Best Picture, winning four for Best Scoring: Original Song Score and Adaptation or Scoring: Adaptation, Best Cinematography, Best Art Direction, and Best Costume Design. In the 2022 Sight & Sound Greatest Films of All Time poll, Barry Lyndon placed 12th in the directors' poll and 45th in the critics' poll.Roger Ebert gave the film three and a half stars out of four and wrote that it ""is almost aggressive in its cool detachment. It defies us to care, it forces us to remain detached about its stately elegance."" He added, ""This must be one of the most beautiful films ever made."" He added the film to his 'Great Movies' list on 9 September 2009 and increased his original rating from three and a half stars to four, writing, ""Stanley Kubrick's Barry Lyndon, received indifferently in 1975, has grown in stature in the years since and is now widely regarded as one of the master's best. It is certainly in every frame a Kubrick film: technically awesome, emotionally distant, remorseless in its doubt of human goodness.""

The film lives through his brilliant actors, but also the slow zoom out, the image compositions, the (mostly natural (or inspired by natural light situations...) light and the intense making process impressed me for sure. --- Man, did you know they used a NASA camera lens that was 0.7 aperture due to Kubricks idea of filming interior scenes with candle light? Or that they had to use camera light filters excessively because they traveled 8 months through France, Germany and Ireland to get these amazing, wide angle painting like shots and the weather kept changing every minute? That impressed me a lot... because it looks so easily done, but hell yes, to make such a masterpiece, you need madness and true passion (Kubrick had it!).
He caused Ken Adam to have some break downs and for sure, it did not seem to be easy to work with Kubrick. But all the locations they chose for the period piece, all the landscapes - they are on point. Adam impresses not only in studio, but on location, big time.The film impresses BECAUSE it tries to give us a (still altered, still artificial, yep...!) glimpse into the 17th century: war, love, monarchy and the fate of a normal man. It feels oddly real and oddly relatable, not only because of the story, but how it is told visually. I was visually pleased throughout the whole movie and am grateful that I finally watched it. It is for sure one of my favorite Kubrick films, because it tells the story of fate and mankind - this time set back few centuries before our time (not in the future like 2001), but asks similar questions... what is fate and what is coincidence? And are we all equal?
Yes - we are: in life, in death, in our human needs.WONDERFUL masterpiece, can only recommend watching it.PS: Can't stop thinking that it inspired also the film THE FAVORITE (2019), as it works sometimes with similar tones and techniques... and a similar story.",8.0,Anonymous,History

A period film like no other . . .,"Stanley Kubrick's Barry Lyndon is a period film like no other, a slow yet utterly mesmerising tale of an Irish upstart whose minor triumphs and major calamities take in the Seven Years' War, the gambling houses of Europe and marriage into the aristocracy. Filmed over 18 tumultuous months without a real script, it stars Ryan O'Neal as well as former model Marisa Berenson, whose limited acting ability is in fact a strength rather than a weakness as the characters become mere figures in a Hogarth-like canvas. Flesh and blood is provided by the likes of Leonard Rossiter and, best of all, Leon Vitali as O'Neal's maltreated stepson. The film features a definitive duel scene (perhaps second only to that in The Duellists), sly narration from Michael Hordern, splendid music ranging from Handel to Schubert and sublime backdrops courtesy of Castle Howard and Blenheim. Give it time, adjust to the pace and enjoy Kubrick's grandest gamble and greatest film.",,Anonymous,History

The Story of a Strange Diversion Taken in the Life of One Redmond Barry,"Barry Lyndon is a film that doesn't follow the life of Redmond Barry but a years-long diversion his life takes which is catalyzed by a, seemingly, unimportant quarrel which leads to major consequences.With this film, Kubrick managed to bring to life a 19th century novel in the best possible way. From the narration, the way the characters behave, the costumes, the soundtrack, and even the use of natural, non-electric lighting make this film feel incredibly authentic.Barry Lyndon thrusts the viewer into this world as you follow Redmond through his life adventures going from a naive Irish farm boy to returning a more broken man. Films like this make for great cinema as following the lives of people and how small instances of something happening can lead to much bigger things later on.This is a character driven story, and as a result some might not find it particularly interesting seeing as how there's no real plot to speak of in the same many might be used to. Redmond is living his life and, in the course of his life and his decisions, things happen as a consequence of them, and thus the story feeds itself. The film doesn't really have so much a conclusion as it simply ends, but since it only follows a particular period of this character's life, ending it any other way aside from with his death, would ruin the feeling of authenticity.This film probably isn't for everybody, especially for those who are more accustomed to plot-driven films. But just like with an old, 19th century novel, if one is willing to remove themselves from what they expect and go in and take this film for what it is one might find what makes this film so fascinating. It's not like Kubrick's other works, but it's still a great piece by him either way.",9.0,Anonymous,History

Barry Lyndon: 8.5/10,"""Barry Lyndon"" has been described as a novel without a hero, and it's true. The main character, Barry, is a man who is enveloped in selfishness and greed, and yet, the film manages to make me so engrossed in his journey through Europe and up the ranks of British society.Speaking of his journey, It was tremendously gorgeous. The beautiful natural landscape and Stanley Kubrick's direction of the whole thing really add to the film. Not only that, I also like the costumes, sets, and Ryan O'Neal's performance In The lead role.Overall, I'd say Barry Lyndon was worth the 3 runtime, and it is yet another great addition to Kubrick's filmography. 8.5/10.Lastly, all stated is just my opinion, and it's okay if you disagree.",8.0,Anonymous,History

Kubrick is God (end of discussion),"This movie needed to be seen the first showing of the first day it played: two weeks later, with scratches and dust on the print, the effect was not quite the same.  The perfection of the style of the cinematography, compositions that were a series of tableaux of period paintings, set the environment of the story like no movie had before (or has since).  The same critics who found this picture over-long and the performances wooden were some of the same people who waxed rhapsodic over 2001.  Though ""wooden"" is a calculated part of Kubrick's palette, 2001 is definitely the longer of the two pictures, in my opinion.  Critics of the day also found the narration to be ""anti-dramatic"", as in several cases throughout, the narrator announced what was about to be played out on the screen.  I found this device, as with Kubrick's other intentional effects in this picture, to be absolute perfection.  Viewers who were not brought up on Kubrick become very impatient with the worshipful tones some of us adopt when discussing his films.  What can I say?  He is the only director whose decisions I would never have the effrontery to question.",,Anonymous,History
Solid Kubrick,"Stanley Kubrick is a clever director making various films that are thought provoking and very memorable films.Barry Lyndon is a different film of his , in fact I do not think any of Kubrick's movies are similar due to his variation of films which is a very good thing , but this film is different because it's set in the 1770's which is a very very old time but Mr Kubrick really depicted the 1770's really well and the way he did it are like , the marching theme and the suits that the people wear very accurately depicted and one of the best thing and possibly the best thing about this movie is how the shots are framed, each frame looks like a very pricy painting from the 1770's that can be sold today for millions , in this movie literally most of the shots were done like that , very very clever camera work and very amazing sets and dialogue and character development and design.The story itself is definitely pretty good the rise of Mr Barry and what he did to achieve all of what he got is so very well done by Mr Kubrick.Overall a pretty solid movie while not the best Kubrick it was definitely great

choice of actor,"I don't have much to add to the assessments made by the other reviewers except to say that Barry Lyndon is one of my favourite films. There is just one point about it that I'd like to comment on, and that is Kubrick's choice of Ryan O'Neal as the actor to play Barry. O'Neal was a good actor but he was not suitable for this part. Few Americans can play the role of a European well. Someone like Malcolm McDowell or Richard Harris or some other Irish or English actor would have been a much better choice. Kubrick may well have picked O'Neal as a draw for the movie-going public. Having said that the film is otherwise a brilliant creation.",8.0,Anonymous,History
THE MOST BEAUTIFUL FILM THAT I HAVE EVER SEEN,"Legendary filmmaker Stanley Kubrick's masterpiece Barry Lyndon is the most beautiful film that I have ever seen. Every single frame is so gorgeous and beautifully photographed. The composition is indescribable in words or even sentences. The bgm is so gripping and beautiful that it will grab you mind hook you on the screen. All of this combined with incredible production design and amazing costume design makes this an all-perfect work of filmography.The story is about Redmond Barry a man who seems to be helpless in the beginning and went through certain hardships and finally became an opportunist and he reached at a position where he acquired great glory. As things changed, he also changed. Once a helpless innocent man became a man of cruelty and immorality. Finally, he got what he deserved. Vengeance paid off on him and lost everything he gained.This movie advocates the philosophy of change in life and also it says that nothing is permanent. One day the mortal coil will be lost. In afterlife there is no good and bad or rich and poor and everyone will be equal because everyone will be in the sleep from which they can't wake up.

BARRY LYNDON (1975) - 11/11/2019,A fabulous picaresque tale - satirical and tragic - in which we see Kubrick make every splendid shot look like an authentic 18th-century painting while using a cynical and essentially cold approach to recount a long series of barely connected episodes in our anti-hero's ill-fated life.

Like stepping into a painting,"'Barry Lyndon' isn't the first movie to come to mind when you think about Stanley Kubrick. But in a filmography of unique pictures this might be his most unique. Yes, the movie is rather long, but it has a certain flow to it that makes you forget the runtime. For three hours you see the story of a man who manages to gain everything he ever wanted and than, just as ruthlessly, lose it all.The viewer follows the endeavours of the Irish low born, Redmond Barry. He falls in love, but can't get the woman he desires. Forced to leave his home he joins the army. First as a soldier of the British army and than as a trusted pawn of the Prussian Army. By lack of a better word, luck befalls on him and he manages to obtain a title of nobility. A position, it turns out, he is unfit for. We see him mistreating his high born wife, fight with his stepson and squandering away almost all of his wife's fortune.'Barry Lyndon' is a three hour case study of an opportunistic man, ruthless and devious in getting what he wants, but who has no idea on how to keep it. Yet, we can't really dislike him for his dubious behaviour and we sympathize with him when things take a turn for the worse. He is no hero, but he isn't trying to be. He is just a human being.Then finally we arrive at the point that sets this movie apart from other films; the cinematography. Every shot seems to be constructed by the master as if it were a painting. Kubrick's greatest talent perhaps was making the highly artistic avant-garde accessible enough for the mainstream. Every bit of picturesque scenery creates the perfect atmosphere and gives the viewer the illusion that it was all carefully crafted by some of the finest painters throughout history. It might be the biggest achievement in cinematography ever put to film.Everything about this film screams art, and although quite long, can be one of the most unique experiences you will ever witness on screen. You just have to sit back and render yourself to the beautiful landscapes and structures Kubrick presents to you.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Epic of a Rogue,"In the mid-to-late 1700's Europe, by the time Ryan O'Neal's BARRY LYNDON has traveled from his small hometown village in Ireland, then as a soldier through a war then a war-deserter and then a captured-deserter throughout several other countries, ninety-minutes have passed... the length of an average motion picture... and with so much literal ground covered, director Stanley Kubrick provided more an episodic than thrilling adventure since every location is its very own thematic vignette with a beginning, middle and end...Where in each, O'Neal's Barry... surrounding by picturesque landscapes intended as visual portrait/paintings framing each gorgeous, self-lighted interior and exterior shot... has to find a way to get his way, from selfish, boyish determination to keep the cousin he's smitten with unmarried, which is the first and perhaps best sequence also involving her would-be military finance Leonard Rossiter, providing a perfectly passive, cowardly counterbalance to O'Neal's intrepid Lyndon, whose last name's originally Redmond...Changed to Lyndon after marrying rich widow Marisa Berenson as Lady Honoria Lyndon, and, while several characters evoke the desperation in O'Neal's character... from a highwayman horse-thief to winning a boxing match with a much larger soldier... she brings out the outright scoundrel... underlined by her only son's hatred... turning Barry's otherwise initially victimized hero into a flawed anti-hero (where a road-ruse sequence involving Prussian captain Hardy Krüger is a standout)... and, ultimately, BARRY LYNDON becomes one of the most vile, unlikable villains in cinema history...Something only a narrowed and determined Ryan O'Neal could pull off so naturally, and without becoming a likeable rogue to keep the audience partially invested: especially during the heightened struggle with the vengeful stepson, now a teenager played by naive yet intense Leon Vitale, who, almost three-hours in, finally provides the movie a potential hero in what's actually an anti-epic epic, ironically centered on a title character hardly worth the time, which is the point all along and the kind of grand cinematic punchline even the biggest Kubrick fanatics initially missed, and why O'Neal's performance is often overlooked and misunderstood.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Relatively unknown jewel - Kubrick at his best?,"It's only a couple of weeks ago that I saw Barry Lyndon for the first time. Though it was a relatively small TV screen I was stunned completely by - everything! I've never seen such marvelous acting, costumes, cut, music selection, camera etc.etc. brought together in a film. Just brilliant. Casting Barry Lyndon with American actor Ryan O'Neal is just a perfect choice. His accent doesn't disturb the movie, it enhances the experience, puts things in a perfect light.

A Dream of Sorrow,"The meticulous award-winning recreation of 18th century Europe, the eye-watering beauty of this film, the opulence, the spectacle of it all is just the framing of a sad human story. The character of Redmond Barry is that of an innocent, but not helpless young man who will do whatever it takes to achieve a gentlemanly status -- and loses it all through his own ungentlemanly behavior. It's not easy to deal with Ryan O'Neal in this role. He does his best, and his commitment to it is obvious but, well, he's still Ryan O'Neal. But he is supported by a flawless cast, I can't begin to enumerate them. I particularly liked Murray Melvin as the parson who is so offended by, and jealous of, the studly young suitor of his patroness.

Again Kubrick has done it, he doesn't use the camera by zooming in and out and using slow motions etc, he is able to simply set up a scene with detail and perfection then let the actors do the rest.Everyone complains that books to film never works.  Often the reason is trying to emphasise the emotion and thought process that takes place is very easy in a book, but very hard on film.  Kubrick just added narration and got the actors to not over-act and it worked perfectly.I could go on and on, but it's been said before.I imagine a lot will say this film is long and boring and it has no story. The reason is we're all conditioned to be told who the good guys are, who's right and wrong.  This is not the case we don't feel for the main character until the scene with his son (which was so well done).This has lots of similarities to 2001, lots of meticulous detail, lots of silences and subtleties.

Bildingsroman - The development of Character,"I was sitting drinking with a friend one night talking about movies, art and literature after a Werner Herzog Q&A following the premiere of his ""Little Dieter wants to Fly"" at the Roxie when the topic of Stanley Kubrik came up. We both instantly agreed he belongs in the pantheon of the movie gods.""What's your favorite Kubrik movie"" he asked.""I know all the Kubrik fans and the critics hated it, but for me it's Barry Lyndon hands down."" I replied.Long story slightly shortened, he agreed wholeheartedly and pulled out a copy from his shelf saying, ""It's the only one I own."" Most people are Kubrik fans for the spectacle of the extreme from films like Clockwork Orange and 2001 - brilliant in their own right - but never get beyond that to the essence of Kubrik - Character Development. Yeah I know, it's the bla bla bla the critics whine about being missing all the time, but that's what makes a movie, not the exploding cars.Barry Lyndon is all about the development of the character of a country Casanova becoming a lord and how his times shaped his character, much in the same way Clockwork Orange is about how language shapes our character.The Bildungsroman - or Character Development Novel - is most often cited as a German development attributed to Goethe and supposedly culminating with Thomas Mann, but the focus on the development of regular people was the major theme of 19th Century European Literature from Stendahlto Dostoyevsky all the way back as far as I can trace it to Shakespeare, Homer or the stories of Cuchullain - and most certainly Thackery and his contemporaries from Charles Dickens to Jane Austin.From Path's to Glory, Spartacus, on to the his last Kubrik is all about character -- even 2001 is strictly focused on the development of human character from the screeching ape to the dying aristocrat in his bed. (When even the development of a computer's character is a theme we are really expected to get the picture of what this is all about.) But he took it to the limit with this one, focusing over three hours on character and boring the action junkies, who were still on the Clockwork Orange horrorshow high, to death.But for myself and for many others this one is his greatest masterpieces because of that focus on character development.

"18th century is flat in England, nothing happens, how can you make something really significant to happen then in reality?","As a director, all genres are there to be picked. Whether you follow the standard of them all or step forward to challenge yourself in creating the ULTIMATE experience of whichever you choose to film about. Psychology of what characters would really say if they were real so to link them to us mortal viewers. Now, depicting an era requires, in the spirit of sincerity and simplicity, showing HOW IT REALLY WAS. Perhaps you'll start hating what you're doing since it will be simply hated by action movie consumers (a big majority of moviegoers) , but it is YOUR creation, and it just matters that you're in the genre doing it. The particularity about ""Barry Lyndon"" is that the story is nothing but reminiscent of the period. But how rich and outstanding was that time's music and paintings, yet their lives were so insignificant to us now. All about fighting irrelevant wars and going against your enemy countries for stupid and lucrative reasons... Depicting normal life requires not adding more than it is, true face value. We may add all the elements of today's movies in order to make this story super exciting, but then it would be again away from how it really was. People had to lit the candles for staying up during night, and life was tremendously BORING without internet and electricity and... Wait, when we see the movie we remove all these four centuries, again, we're trapped in boredomness, even though people lived in that way by that time. Period. From the bottom of our smartphones, Did we forget that we were humans? Was really Kubrick right in stating that we would be tech consumers totally immersed in talking with machines? Without technology we're living beings. Out of the life of going to school and studying in order to get a career, without any purpose in life, we make mistakes after mistakes, try again and again to reach our goals even when they're not the real goals from the spirit, spend our time in meaningless activities... In few words, ""Barry Lyndon"" shows us how was life before this post industrial revolution era. Perhaps you will say I'm not speaking about the movie at all, but, for the sake of valuing this movie, it really requires that we simply focus on WHAT IS IT TO MAKE A QUINTESSENTIAL MOVIE OF ITS ONE AND ONLY GENRE, or the different genres that it may englobe or represent.It doesn't really matters if the viewers like it or not, the way it is made and the whole resources that were used and the quality of all the elements put together. ""Barry Lyndon"" really reset the standard on how this genre had to be depicted, and how tremendously boring are period movies again! But how fascinating is liberating ourselves from this era, experiencing something that's not us.Honestly, the mixture of painting-like scenes with the mesmerizing music, the costumes and the candle-lit scenarios is the only thing that really helps digest these 3 hours of bittersweet and saddening dialogues. The result made the Academy speak and say: this is true grand filmmaking at its purest state, despite the boredomness again!The appreciation of culture only appears when we pay attention to what is done in the culture itself, no matter how insipid it was. If people from that era would manage to see this movie they would say: Kubrick, come here to our age and delight us because your time's people don't appreciate you at all! A few ones still do it. And counting... Dare me to say there are more than it appears.Despite what the audience may think, a movie belongs to its director, it's his/her creation. Perhaps people who speak about movies are eclipsed on what Kubrick did simply because he dedicated himself to simply create movies that, after 60 years still generate ardent debates over if we like them or not. People in the cinema industry keep talking and talking, and in the meantime, If you, moviegoer, truly appreciate music, paintings, culture and real life style of a specific era at its splendor, then ""Barry Lyndon"" is the movie for you. If action, speed and rollercoaster emotions suit you, still take a seat and you decide to give it two stars or take a step forward into reviewing it for how IT really is.Watching reality with Kubrick is really painful and rewarding at times. And this movie is not the exception at all. Taste it and enjoy it. You'll love it or hate it. Get to see what's beneath. Kubrick is tremendously impartial in all his filmography. Symmetry and order: Kubrickian doctrine. A 50/50 bet that will never end, or will it? A duel that starts and ends the same way. And again, every review is totally valid. But review, please!

One of my all time favorites,"This has the most well developed characters of any Kubrick film. It is hilarious spell-binding beautiful and of course tragic. The dichotomy between surface level civility/decorum and primal brutality is exquisite. The casting is top notch. Barry stumbles his way to the top, and that very same ambition becomes his undoing in the end. Lord Bullingdon comes off very sympathetic as an innocent bystander of Barry's social climbing. The ending was perfect and the epilogue was the cherry on top, a simple yet eloquent statement that we are equal in death. There are no true villains or heroes in this journey.

I dont believe any film has ever captured the feel of the late 1700's better than this film did. the costumes are great,and sets are perfect. I also liked the whole natural light method in which this film was made.And the story is set into 2 halves, the first half is the rise Redmon Barry, and the 2nd half is the fall of Barry Lyndon(who are the same person)I even liked the narration of this film(I normaly despise narration- but the narration worked perfect for this film). This is a very classy film, and all of the actors did an outstanding job.(BTW:this film won 4 oscars). I reccomend this film, -you may or may not like it(I liked it but will also admit that other films in this same genre will blow it away -I found it interesting that a box set was released in 2000 with all of Kubrick's films in it- but this one(Barry Lyndon)was the only Kubrick film not in the box set. Kubrick knew that this film couldn't stand up to other films in this genre which is why he called it a failure-He believed at the time he was filming it that this was going to be his ""Gone With the Wind"" sweeping epic that would be endured for all times - and it never became that). This film also has one of the most unusual music scores I ever heard,the only way to describe the music in this film is wierd.But If you really liked this film you need to See ""Bernard Cornwell's Sharpe Series,"" any of the A&E ""Horatio Hornblower"" movies or ""The Patriot""(Starring Mel Gibson)because after seeing truely great movies like those, you will soon forget about Barry Lyndon.

"Not as bad as I remember, but not as good as I wish.","I always dread rewatching Barry Lyndon. I tend to think of it as a weak film, more focused on cinematic gimmicks than intriguing story. I am bothered by all the reverse zoom shots, verite shots, freeze frames, candlelit scenes, Irish dances, and dirge overtures. Ryan O'Neil is a Dick Van Dyke Irishman with no emotional range. Marissa Berenson is a beautiful tangle of wigs. Leon Vitalli is the homeliest antagonist I've ever seen.But the years have mellowed me. O'Neil is still terrible, but I am finding nuances in his performance that keep me staring intensely. Berenson is still beautiful, but the deadpan expressions reveal a stoic personality and tragic character that stirs emotion. The camerawork is dated, but Kubrick's canvas is vast and stunning.I have a great deal more empathy for O'Neil's Barry. I see his life struggle like my own, full of adventure humor, and tragedy, as he works his way up the ladder of success. And he is successful. Barry even finishes life well off. Bullingdon makes good on a promise.What is unspoken is that the Narrator is unreliable. He sets the expectation that Barry is a cad and an imposter. We see Barry's bad habits, but we see he is good, too. He apologizes to his wife for his infidelity. He confesses over his desertions and Irish feelings. He canes Bullingdon, but rather gently and with good reason. He spares Bullingdon when he doesn't half to.So, far from being a woeful tale of tragedy and ruin, Barry Lyndon, reveals a life well-lived and almost brought to ruin, not by Barry's mistakes and greed, but by conniving people seeking to bring him down.As with any Kubrick film, you have to slow down and think about what you are seeing. There are many complexities and many levels, even in beautiful film like Barry Lyndon.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Young rogue Irishman,"The movie; Infinity is a unique and masterpiece. Deep and narrative based on narrative. The narrator takes the viewer to the depths of the story, as if we were with Redmond along with his story. And in critical moments, our teacher reminds us of pure pleasure in cinema. What do we want from a masterpiece film? The story, the narrative, the epic, the love, the tragedy, the joy of life, and ultimately the salvation, all of which can be found in this Barry Lyndon.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Cult Movies 48,"48. BARRY LYNDON. adventure-drama, 1975: Ambitious but naive, Barry (RyanO'Neil) is determined to gain a higher place in 17th-century European society. However, his hot-tempered manner gets him into trouble early in life when a loveless romance ends in tragedy. Forced to flee his home, he enlists in the British army. Deserting, he finds success with a shrewd cardsharper that takes him under his wing. At last, having dispelled the notions of love and mastering the disguise of a 'gentleman', he courts the Countess of Lyndon (Marisa Berenson). They marry and he inherits her vast wealth, along with great troubles.Critique: Stanley Kubrik's overlong, ambitious epic stopped a run of critical and commercial hits (that started with 'The Killing'(1956). Kubrik's forte has always rested on his thematic storytelling and eccentric camera-work. Though intricately plotted and lavishly produced, the film suffers from these same excesses.The first 'part' of the film is a complete bore, without any of Kubrik's wit and imagination. However, it is considerably lifted when the lovely Marisa Berenson appears as the Countess of Lyndon. Her courting scene is one of the most hypnotic, expertly filmed sequences in cinema history.The rest of the performances are adequate at best, and Kubrik's vision is still wonderful to watch. The music (as in every Kubrik film) is beautifully resonant. The film's slow pace and artistic excesses by Kubrick, makes it not for all tastes.QUOTES: Narrator: ""The doctors were called. But what does a doctor avail in the contest with the grim, Invincible enemy.""",8.0,Anonymous,History
"Paintings Didn't Come To Life, Life Came Into Paintings.","This is simply a masterpiece. Each of Kubrick's film has a statement about humanity and life. Barry Lyndon is not the exception. In fact, I think this is the most powerful statement made by Kubrick, no, by movies! Never before nor after did a film express how a life can change so much trough time and how other value your life has it changes because of your surroundings. It expressed that selfishness can destroy other peoples lives, the power of forgiveness, the sadness of death. It also expressed the passage of time on each and every human being, having lived a wealthy life or not, being selfish or not, no matter our age that death can reach everyone of us and that we should live our life in the best way possible. Those are only Kubrick's work. The acting was incredible! Some of the actors didnt say a word for the intire movie and still made us understand all the emotions that they where going through. It is also one of the best looking movie of all time, some people even describe it has an animations of painting. The music, was incredible, all those classic music pieces joined together made an ocean of emotions. This is certainly the most powerful movie anyone can see, it has absolutely no flaws, it is awesome in its own way and I think its closest you will ever get to understand Stanley Kubrick's genius.",10.0,Anonymous,History
one word: beautiful!,"I began to be a fan of Mr. Kubrick last year, and ever since, I've constantly tried to get my hands on every film he's done.The cinematography is the most beautiful I've ever seen, next to Gone with the Wind.  The acting was tight, and generally very well done.  The adapted period music sounded great to the ear.  And the story, I found very interesting.  To me, there is a moral to this fine story by Thackery.  If you are given somthing good, don't screw everything up by taking advantage of it, or being greedy.  Though the film was very long, I, myself, did not find it boring.  (My mother fell asleep through some of it, yet she loved the story line.  And she doesn't even like long movies like Barry Lyndon.) This film can be overlooked by young fans of Mr. Kubrick, and it is a shame, because this is amongst his greatest triumphs.",,Anonymous,History
Visual Masterpiece,"Truly a visual masterpiece by Kubrick. The movie is one of the most visually amusing/satisfying movies and the score really set the mood with the costumes and the musical pieces.However, the story was kinda dull/boring and characters were cold and emotionless. The movie in that sense didn't strike me! I honestly think if any other director did the same movie he wouldn't get praised like Kubrick in this movie. Yes this movie is GREAT but not as much as people are hyping it. To be a great movie every single aspect has to be a ""Masterpiece"", not just the costumes and cinematography.Th movie is visually stunning. It's like every shot by Kubrick is a classical painting. I was fascinated that he used a lenses developed by NASA to shoot in low light, The use of wide shots, symmetry, and slow zooms further enhances the film's experience!!A true cinematic masterpiece.The movies' costumes, sets was surprising and very authentic.. it really set me in that period.This dedication to make such a historic movie realistically accurate allowed the audience to experience history as it was. (in that period)What I really noticed and enjoyed very much was the score! It really set the mood and shaped the tone emotionally! It's very elegant.However! I didn't like it to the point that it's a complete masterpiece and one of the greatest movies ever! Why?::The slow pace as i feel kubrick concentrated more on atmosphere and visual composition over traditional dramatic plot.Also the characters felt emotionally detached . It was very hard for me as a viewer to connect with them! Even barry!At first he was ambitious and a loving person l! Then a terrible person who you couldn't feel any compassion too..Even Lady Lyndon was very rigid (maybe reflected the era she was in depending on her class). Anyways they were very cold and detached. Their acting didn't let me feel anything for them or the movieAs I said, Kubrick i feel depended on visuals rather than words. Story very boring a dull. First part was interesting, built a sense of adventure. Then the second part was the decline of Barry Lyndon (as an aristocrat).Also Why the hell did he let him shoot his leg?Anyways, enjoyed it visually the cinematography, directing, costumes and even score. But the story and characters were very dull and cold and the storyline was not very interesting.",8.0,Anonymous,History
"The best ever? Well, ...","... probably not, but still a ten. Photography is luscious. Costumes and sets are other worldly. Pacing is excruciatingly slow, however. All those set this film In a class of very, very few.Absolutely recommended by me as well as the Academy.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Kubrick,"In one word, its a Kubrick. Perfection in every frame, strong ark, nice cast. The one and characters are a bit sterile but was intentional. Same for main char. A bit doll like but that was exactly the point. Art direction, idea shown and subtle humor is on unreachable levels.",8.0,Anonymous,History
"Truly, every frame is a painting","This film shows the tale of the eponymous Barry Lyndon, the antihero of Irish origins trying to make his way in the aristocracy. It's a truly epic film with a sprawling runtime and methodical pace. From the very beginning, we see his impulsive and tempestuous character running into deep conflict with everyone around him, a theme repeated many times in his life. Another big theme we encounter is Barry's opportunistic trickery, used to escape the army, scam gamblers out of money and suck the Lyndon estate dry. These are portrayed in lingering scenes that resemble paintings, showing the reactions and thoughts of everyone in a way that allows for visual contemplation.",9.0,Anonymous,History
The life of a boring nobody,"Three solid hours of style over substance, elaborate costumes, and closeups of pensive faces, an exercise in lighting and camera angles and wood paneled interiors, all could have been better served to showcase a main character who actually accomplished something significant, but instead we get an intimate look at an average Joe, played by an average Joe. What does it all mean? There is no meaning. The Shining=haunted house. 2001=a statement about humanity. Dr. Strangelove=the cold war. The Killing=heist film. Barry Lyndon=???? Ryan O'Neal is woefully miscast, it's actually painful to watch him struggling to keep up with more accomplished actors, I notice that none of the ten-star reviews defend his awful performance and accent.",3.0,Anonymous,History
