Spiritual and graceful experience filled with beauty and poetry!,"Such a beautiful film that goes so, so deep. For me, it was a truly spiritual experience to watch this film again after 8 years. The images are beautiful, unique and the thousands of match cuts connecting the film's inner spiritual layer with the real life of the characters (in a non-linear manner) is just sublime. For me, this is poetry and a beautiful testament to love, pain, life - and the never ending cycle of life.",7.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
"Beautiful visuals, great acting and great direction","There's a lot going for this film. The CGI is exceptional as are the performances. There's beauty in every part from the actors' performances, direction and CGI/visuals.So why not a higher score?
The message of the film isn't ludicrous but it has been explored before many times. Is death a necessary part of life? Can we conquer it? Should we even be trying? It's not a bad set of questions to ask. But as the film develops you're repeatedly pounded on the head by a weak analogy with a tree of life. When you get to the last twenty minutes of the film the analogy becomes actively irritating.It's definitely worth a watch. Just don't expect anything hugely thought provoking.",7.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
Absolutely Fantastic,"Fantastic in every sense. This film is indeed poetry, and a beautiful testament to love and the cycle of life, and the impermanence of death. Wow. The script is tight, and the non-linear presentation works very well. The scene compositions were exquisite. The score enhanced without being overbearing, which is so often the case in contemporary film.The acting is absolutely superb, but then it's got Hugh Jackman and Rachel Weisz. I can't imagine Brad Pitt doing any sort of justice to this film. Darren Aronofsky lucked out in the long run by getting someone who has the range to portray the vast emotions required for Tomas/Tommy/Tom. Weisz has the depth for regal intrigue and spirited grace. Their chemistry makes their stories even more entrancing.This film does require a thinking brain to be appreciated.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
A Fascinating Gem,"'The Fountain' is one fascinating film. I don't think there's enough words to describe what it's like. After watching the film, I've read several different interpretations and can only conclude that don't make a decision on what you've read, simply watch the film. It's a unique movie-watching experience.Aronofsky took me by complete surprise. I loved his 'Requiem for a Dream' but I did not expect him to come up with something so different. Man, is that a big difference, not only in content but also in technique and pretty much everything. All I knew beforehand was that the film was a science fiction and that it starred Hugh Jackman and Rachel Weisz (actors whom I like). After watching it, I can safely say that 'The Fountain' is much more than just a science fiction flick.I won't mention much of the plot as I do not want to ruin the experience by giving any spoilers. I would love to discuss the film with people who have already seen it. Aronofsky uses of symbolism, colour, and spectacular visuals to tell a story of life, death, love and rebirth. The visuals are simply breathtaking and the special effects are phenomenal. The use of different camera angles is particularly excellent as it gives the viewer (well at least me) the feel of the moving time and space. He cleverly uses lighting and colour to distinguish between the atmosphere of the different times as he does with the zoomlens. And, of course the soundtrack which is very underused but beautifully noticeable.Hugh Jackman is terrific in a multidimensional character and Rachel Weisz is phenomenal. She's particularly outstanding as she plays her part with a subtle intensity. Ellen Burstyn has a smaller role but she is splendid to watch.It's really difficult to describe what the experience is like in just a few words. I haven't yet understood every single aspect of 'The Fountain' and am going to be rewatching it, but it does stay in mind long after the end credits have rolled. It's a complex theme but the basis is simple. It won't be liked by many as so many of it is left to interpretation with a lot of questions but for me it's fascinating and is all a movie-watching experience should be.",,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
It's all done except the last chapter. I want you to help me. FINISH IT...,"""TheFountain"" is a story tackling three different time periods. Tomas (Hugh Jackman) is a 16th century Conquistador on a bloody hunt though a hidden Mayan temple to retrieve sap from the mythical Tree of Life for his queen (Rachel Weisz), who is desperate for immortality. In 2005, Tom (Jackman) is a doctor frenetically searching for the cure to cancer to save the life of his wife Izzi (Weisz), who is in the final throes of her battle with death. Five hundred years later, Tom travels through space on a quest to reach the place of tranquility that Izzi spoke fondly of, using the Tree as a device to get him to the answers he needs to rest his weary mind....In performances that can only be described as exquisite, Jackman and Weisz assist their director in opening up this knotty story through their soulful and romantic interpretations of desperation and peace. Essentially playing one lost soul, Jackman foams with remarkable anguish as he performs three separate interpretations of duty, handing in career-defining work. Weisz is the face of love in ""The Fountain,"" lending the film a flowering emotional core of the film.The Fountain"" is masterful on so many unique levels, presenting a demanding filmgoing experience that should elicit a grand sense of awe on an emotional and spiritual level unlike anything you've seen this year.Aronofsky has out done himself again....",9.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
Kubrick-esque,"Continuing my plan to watch every Hugh Jackman movie in order, I come to The Fountain (2006)Plot In A Paragraph: As a modern-day scientist, Tommy is struggling with mortality, desperately searching for the medical breakthrough that will save the life of his cancer-stricken wife.This movie is very Kubrick-like, which, given I'm not a fan of Kubrick, probably explains why it does not really work for me. The acting by Jackman and Weisz, is fine, and the visuals are stunning, but it just doesn't work for me.The movie abruptly jumps between its three timelines, but it is easy enough to know what timeline you are in, just by looking at How much hair Hugh Jackman has. But I actually think there is only one timeline, the modern day one, at least it's the way I viewed it.Too many blinding lights. Too many transitions for their own sake. Abrupt changes of tone. I believe I have not seen the real film. When a $75 million production goes into turnaround and is made for $35 million, elements get eliminated. When a film telling three stories and spanning thousands of years has a running time of 96 minutes, scenes must have been cut out.Director Darren Aronofsky initially cast Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett in the central leads of Tom and Izzi with a budget of $75 million dollars. During pre-production, Pitt and Aronofsky were having major creative differences, so Pitt left and Blanchett followed. Warner Bros cut the budget to $35 million dollars, both Weisz and Jackman agreed to work on the film at a reduced rate, to ensure the movie went ahead.Warner Bros. refused to do a director's commentary for the DVD release, so Darren Aronofsky recorded one in his living room and released it on his website. I think I will need to listen to that, as there could be some great insight in there.The Fountain grossed $10 million at the domestic box office to be the first Hugh Jackman movie to lose money, since he became a star.",6.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
Beautiful film about mortality,"It is essential to let go of needs and allow for something new, something more peaceful, to take its place. The main issue for people is not to advocate any specific worldview or philosophy, but rather to show that death is natural to life and something that everyone has to face. It is when people find some way of reconciling with mortality that they can fully be present and not be too worried about the world around them. Our lives are brief and are at the mercy of forces beyond our control, which can suffocate consciousness and delude people into falsehood.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
A Stellar Soul-Searching Experience!,"Darren Aronofsky's The Fountain follows the story of a man who seemingly travels across three worlds. One as a conquistador, another as a scientist, and the last one as a monk. The proper plot of The Fountain is perhaps up to interpretation, but it is definitely a film worth watching at least a couple of times. While the multiple-world storyline is not new, Aronofksy's use of it make for a surreal yet beautiful experience of a tale of love, death, meaning, and acceptance.
The Fountain is without a doubt, a very unique film in that its meaning is almost obscure and abstract yet quite concrete. As the film progresses, we can see changes in the characters and more specifically their views on certain subjects, Hugh Jackman's three-roles will also stay in your mind for quite some time after watching the film as The Fountain is another film that shows his remarkable range.
The film itself is a work of art, a narrative-commentary on perhaps the meaning of life and death. It features a somewhat simple, yet very memorable score composed by Clint Mansell which does a fantastic job of alleviating the storyline. From a narrative point of view, The Fountain is a film that you are not meant to be explained to. The film asks you as the viewer to find the meaning yourself.
Furthermore, the cinematography of The Fountain is gorgeous and artistic, it really felt as if every shot carried so much weight and meaning, this accompanied with the three-world-storyline and surreal dialogue do a great job of wrapping up together an unexpectedly joyful and bittersweet experience of a film.
Ultimately, if you want a film that will make you continuously think about its meaning, attach you to delicate yet detailed characters, and also make you question your own worldview, the Fountain is a movie worth watching. Do not let the 2006 release date fool you, for the film itself still holds up to the current day, largely in part because of its complexity and curious storyline.",7.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
Death is the road to awe,If you think this movie was boring you didn't give it a chance to provoke any thoughts of love and mortality within yourself. Slow yes but powerful up to the end,7.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
Beautiful and probably one of the best movies of the century,"...and here I shall attempt to review what will one day be a classic in the hopefully near future. The Fountain is many things. It's a touching film. It's not long, though, clocking in at around 80 or 90 minutes, but it does manage to pack in enough emotion to out-do every single lame, candy-assed Hollywood romance ever created, or almost. More movies should cut down their running times like this; because there is not a wasted moment in The Fountain from start to finish, despite the movie still moving at an gregariously slow pace. You won't find any blitzed, seizure-inducing cut-and-paste editing scenes here, and there are no epic explosions and battle scenes either. What you will find, though, is an entire treasure trove of realistic passion and jaw-dropping emotion, and that's the strong point of this movie. Nothing here feels contrived or derivative or fake at all - this is a story of a woman with a lot of love in her heart and a passion for life in general, and a man who would do anything to preserve the same love for all eternity. That's the Fountain.The Fountain is a simple movie. While at first it's repertoire of lazily abstract images and slow plot construction may seem intimidating and might even turn off the average moviegoer, a deeper voyage into The Fountain's layers reveals something not hard to comprehend at all. I mean, honestly, this film is a love story at it's core, there are no mind-bending plot twists and secret meanings. It's just a passionate, intricately woven romance about how far a man would go to let his love live on forever. If you're looking for super slick plot twists and drama, then look elsewhere, because The Fountain is not your typical modern flick at all. As I said, average moviegoers probably won't be able to get into this one. It's just too abstract and weird, and I won't blame anyone for disliking it on the basis of it's obvious inaccessibility. But regardless, the shimmering majesty of this movie is evident to those who are willing to try and find it. It's clear after the film sinks in - The Fountain is a straightforward and simple film disguised by multiple layers of artistic refinement and glorious imagery. Oh, it's not all clear cut for you, there is one other sticky point for some people - the fact that The Fountain takes place in three different time-spans all at once, weaving them together into a rich, complex tapestry of master-class storytelling. Yet somehow, despite the winding complexity of it all, The Fountain remains a pretty basic story once you get your head around it's eccentricities. Simplicity and complexity go hand in hand here to create a plethora of beauty and sorrow, a perfect oxymoron.There's a very deep, broad contrast between the beautiful simplicity of the film's plot line and the absolutely jaw-dropping grandeur of the special effects and graphics utilized here. The directing here is through the roof, and the cinematography on display here is probably amongst the five or six best from any movie I've ever seen, if not the very top of the goddamn list. Just watch the last few minutes of the movie, and you'll understand. One of the things I really love about The Fountain is that it's beautiful and touching without trying to be anything it isn't. It's an honest film, and it does everything it wants to do effortlessly and flawlessly, with graceful, sweeping movements that etch a stunning caricature of rich, luscious aesthetics into an otherwise simple story. Marvelous.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
"Beautifully haunting and wonderfully bizarre, but its ambitions weigh it down, along with its clinical and distant approach to the characters","Visually stimulating but frustratingly disconnected from its viewers, The Fountain establishes director Darren Aronofsky as one of our most daring and adventurous directors  but his ambitions are ultimately what cause The Fountain to sink beneath its own heavy-handed pretensions.Aronofsky has a way of making the most everyday events thrilling and beautiful, but his clinical approach to the characters of the film  portrayed by Hugh Jackman and Rachel Weisz  creates a cold distance. A film such as this requires us to invest our emotions in the characters, which is impossible to do when they are so haphazardly presented. While the art sequences are mesmerizing, every time Aronofsky spends time focusing on his characters the movie hits a brick wall and becomes incredibly tiresome.The fragmented story structure certainly doesn't help much in this regard. While it is no doubt an excuse for some awe-inspiring visual creations, every time Aronofsky cuts to another storyline more distance is drawn between the audience and the characters in the movie.The plot, if you can follow this, involves a driven doctor (Jackman) trying to develop a cure for death. He claims it is just a disease, like anything else, and that he will be the one to give humans infinite life.He is not driven by greed  his wife (Weisz) is dying of cancer and so he feels obligated to deliver her a cure.Meanwhile, the film veers off onto two different paths  one involving a Spanish conquistador and his quest for the Fountain of Youth, the other about the doctor from the first storyline (I think?) being trapped in a bubble in outer space with a dying tree (which his wife is apart of because it grew from her corpse  yes, honestly) and his struggle toummpreserve the tree and himself so they can live together forever.The film's soundtrack, composed by Clint Mansell (Requiem for a Dream), is perhaps the highlight of the entire picture. Mansell is quickly establishing a name for himself as one of Hollywood's greatest composers.And certainly the movie will wow audiences looking for something pretty. But it is not a very enjoyable experience, for the most part, and the scenes involving human conflict dragged on seemingly forever.And so as an art-house picture this is wonderfully bizarre, beautifully haunting and utterly captivating; I just wish Aronofsky had chosen a film that did not require more emotional involvement than he was willing to develop.",6.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
Death is the Road to Awe,"This is not a film for any one public. Americans, often ignorant of philosophy and mythology (by and large) would stumble awkwardly through much of the film, wondering what the hell is going on. Others still would prefer to call the film pretentious and drenched in metaphysical bull----. Woe it is to the archetypes. No one knows how to reach the elemental, the archetypal arena of human experience anymore; a fact proved by so many other reviewers penchant for searching for the ""realism"" within the movie. (cf. Roger Ebert's review; this is a thoroughly stupid and ignorant way of viewing such a film...it seems that the Divine Comedy would be cast aside today, because Dante does not describe Paradise in a ""realistic"" fashion. Which of course is worse than nonsense...its f---ing stupid.)The problem many people have with this film is that they see it as a story about two people, and not two archetypes that are elemental within human mythology (first man and first woman). It is interesting to note how Jackman becomes Western man (furious and daring, he hopes to reach beyond nature, to become a 'superman,' while not understanding that he is not simply a product of nature but very much a PART of nature) and Weisz becomes the embodiement of Eastern thought (her submission to the truth of nature (death) is not a submission, but an understanding of the tide of life, an understanding Tom, in all his embodiements, does not possess). I see a purity in the representation of first man and first woman, a purity that allows me to see the characters as archetypes that resemble the spiritual forces that have driven us for our eternity.Ebert said that it is a standard critical practice not to create a fiction that was not implicit within the film; but with a film like The Fountain, there are so many interpretations and meanings...deep thoughts linger in me while I watch, an ocean of experiences that dwells inside me, calm and enveloping. Interpretaions can, in their own rights, be works of art, if what they interpret, in itself, is beautiful. I will not pretend that my interpretation is right, complete, or a work of art; but what I have seen and felt from this film has filled me with something I cannot describe--if the definition was not insufficient, I would call it God--yet so many pass by it with scorn and rolling eyes. I hope some will see in it what I have felt pass through so many times...or at least to understand, at the very least, that just because a movie doesn't touch you, it does not mean that your perception of the movie is, in itself, truth; it is merely an opinion like mine. On art there is no truth, except the pieces we craft ourselves.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
"Interesting, musical, arty weirdness!","Been meaning to see this for sometime. Heard someone say it was their favourite film recently and wax lyrical about it so though it was time.I can understand why it is was averagely rated by critics and slated by some humans as tosh, others as amazing. It's several stories intertwined (3 in fact). Visual with effecting music. About love, and the efforts from Hugh Jackman to save his soul mate (Rachel Weisz) from death. It's ethereal and not light hearted, love, illness, death and the tree of life!I enjoyed it, I am a generous audience. It was interesting and thought provoking in places. I liked the visuals and music. The leads were capable.Favourite quote:

The Path to Life,"I had the immense pleasure of viewing this film for its second screening ever, when it was showcased at Chicago's International Film Festival. Fans of Aronofsky who enjoyed the intensity of 'PI' and 'REQUIEM FOR A DREAM' will find that Darren's primary thematic focus has shifted yet again from the mind and gut ('PI' and 'REQUIEM', respectively) to the heart. However, don't take this to mean that 'THE FOUNTAIN' isn't intellectually engaging or visceral in its impact.In a word, this film is warm. Aronofsky's palette for his third feature is a swirling miasma of golden yellows, and it sets the tone for the work. 'THE FOUNTAIN' is a life-affirming treatise on the eternity of love. Cynical hacks might decry this as a mawkish, facile rumination of saccharine proportions, but despite the sentimental themes, the film is never cloying, opting instead for a (sur)realistic portrayal of the nuances of one of life's most powerful emotions.The casting was superb: Rachel Weisz and Hugh Jackman are outstanding in their roles, with both offering utterly believable performances. Weisz reveals the same depths she did in 'THE CONSTANT GARDENER', portraying myriad subtleties in a role that could've easily been misplayed, starring as Jackman's love throughout time. For those who've only seen Jackman in action-oriented mutant movies, his command of his character's strengths AND frailties is a welcome surprise. The supporting cast was excellent as well, with Ellen Burstyn standing out in particular.Special effects were phenomenal, even without taking the film's halved budget into consideration. I won't spoil the surprise, but when you find out how Aronofsky and Co. achieved some of the extraordinary images, you're sure to be impressed (and reminded of a film classic from over 25 years ago). This is not a film to rely on FX, though. In fact, the segment (not scene; the story is split across three time periods) using the bulk of the effects is probably the shortest.Aronofsky ambitiously tackles heavy themes and concepts and he does it in a little over 90 minutes. I didn't realize how short the film was until it was over. However, 'THE FOUNTAIN's brevity could also be perceived as an extension of one of its themes: learning to appreciate the world and its beauty in whatever time we are allotted.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
Fails to hit the right emotional notes,"Having watched Pi, The Whale and Black Swan, I was curious and intrigued to watch Darren Aronofsky's The Fountain. A movie set in three different centuries centering around a tree of life, was probably a premise that could have only been handled by Aronofsky. But I have to say that I was let down.While the premise is fascinating, the script lacks any kind of emotional depth. Even though the performances are up to the par, one couldn't feel emotinally connected to the characters. I feel that 1hr36min runtime was an injustice to the film, as a premise like this needs time to be developed.However I did the production design and visual effects to be marvellous. The set pieces during Tomas' scenes were excellently crafted, that transported you to the medieval era. Also, the sky coloured in golden-hues was breathtaking to say the least.The film further gets complimented by excellent score, which fits the tone of the film . There is a grand and regal feeling to it, which was perfect for a film like this.",6.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
"Confusing, surreal and pretentious","I've read, with great interest, the various interpretations and comments on The Fountain and while I appreciate that the film was open to interpretation and probably deserves re-watching to appreciate its finer points, I can't help feeling that it was left so open as to be almost utterly incomprehensible (assuming one was watching it without the synopsis to hand). I persevered in the hope that it would all become clear - it did to some extent but it was such a difficult and baffling experience that I can't say I would want to bother with it ever again. I thought it was pretentious in the extreme. For those of you who got something out of it, I'm pleased otherwise it would have been a complete waste of time, money and talent.",1.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
What a frustrating movie!,"I don't really mind seeing a movie that's just outright bad, but a movie like this, that is so promising and contains so many excellent elements but doesn't pull through in the end, is worse! So much about this movie is great - the ""modern day"" story is excellently written and acted (mostly acted; Hugh Jackman is phenomenal) and really got me emotionally involved, and the Mayan mythological elements seemed surprisingly uncontrived. But every segment involving ""Tom"" positively ruins the effect. These sequences are so New Age-y and ridiculous that it totally detaches you from any kind of emotional involvement in the film, and it's really painful how ridiculous they are. It doesn't help that Mogwai lay on the cheeze as thick as it comes with their contributions to the score. To top it all off, the movie absolutely REFUSES to end, so that even though it has a short running time (hardly over an hour and a half), it feels like Aronofsky was actually the one who found the formula for eternal life (and gave it to his movie!). There's a lot of waste here - wasted acting, wasted writing, wasted visuals - because in the end, you will laugh at how ridiculous some of the scenes are, and at how godawful and inconclusive the ""ending"" is. I really hope that the graphic novel is better, but until then, just go watch Solaris (either version) - it deals with all of these themes much more gracefully and with great subtlety.",6.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
A New Transcendental Film,"This is one half of a review. Some films need to be seen more than once to be fully grasped. This is one of them.I would like to read Paul Schrader's review of this film. Not because he wrote the screenplay for Taxi Driver, but because he wrote a book about ""Transcendental Style in Film"" and ""The Fountain"" is certainly in this category of film-making.Because of Schrader's book, I've been viewing as many films by Dreyer, Ozu, and Bresson, that I can lay my hands on  especially those by Robert Bresson. There are many parallels between Aronofsky's film and Bresson, and yet their style is completely different  it's like comparing a Tintype photograph with a Van Gogh: Bresson is understated while Aronofsky is over the top. Yet, both directors create films that are best viewed more than once. Both styles leave a lot to the imagination which can be frustrating on the first viewing. I certainly was. This is why I consider this to be one half of a review. I've only seen this film once.The Fountain has three story lines: one set in the past, one in the present, and one set ostensibly in the future. The three timelines weave in an out of each other like a Chinese puzzle. The past is poetic, the present is realistic, and the future is plausible. Moreover the future be either a real future (as cinematic futures go) or merely a dream of the future. So, this could be a very subjective story that takes place now. It is ambiguous, mysterious, and subject to personal interpretation. In this regard, The Fountain, is very much like the films of Bresson.Bresson once mentioned that he intentionally avoids the obvious in his film; it is the mystery that propels the viewer's interest forward. Often later scenes reveal the mystery of that earlier enigma. This is a very literary form of film-making. Last night, I was surrounded by people in the audience who wanted every plot detail handed to us on a silver platter. As this was a sneak preview, we all got in for free. Some were probably expecting the extremes of ""Requiem for a Dream"". A group next to me left early. As I was leaving, I heard a teen say into her cell phone ""don't bother to pay for this film  wait for it when it is on TV  for free"". And I agree: if you can tolerate a lot of commercial TV and prefer magazines to books, then you may not like this film. If you read some of the reviews, for Bresson, you'll get some of the same impatience. These are films which break with what you'd expect from a film. Forget that you're in a movie theater; this piece will reward an open mind.The acting in The Fountain is very dynamic but there was not enough breathing room for empathy. There is only one break in the tension when there could have been more. Instead, to serve the three story lines, the tension feels like one continuous climb. A tearful moment, from one storyline, leads to another tearful moment in another storyline. The group next to me  the one that ultimately left  were snickering. It feels like overacting, even though each performance is convincing, on its own. So, I felt my empathy in suspension. A different edit would have added more power to the emotional timbre of the acting. I find myself wishing for another 20 minutes of story to draw me in.The music blended very well with the story  they never stood apart, which is ideal for a cinematic score. The visuals, however, did break the suspension of disbelief, on a few occasions. In one case, there was a tracking shot that uses a unique point of view that took me out of the story, thinking ""wow, cool shot!"", instead of thinking ""I wonder where he is going"". There is a certain amusement ride feel to some of the cinematography and Special Effects which detracts from the story. But, these shots are not gimmicks. They're premonitions and echoes of action in other sequences. They are crazy bold, like Van Gogh's brushstrokes tracing out a landscape. These bold strokes are the first thing that I notice, about ""The Fountain"". But, upon reflection, they paint a picture that is rather calm.I look forward to seeing this movie again.",9.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
Visually and thematically impressive and touching  trying to attribute a narrative context to all of it will be missing the point,"Tomas searches Mayan country, seeking the legendary tree of eternal life that offers him the chance to free his captive queen. A medical researcher pushes the bounds of professional ethics as he attempts to extract a natural cure for his dying wife. A traveller in deep space attempts to make it to a dying star wrapped within a nebula in order to spend eternity with his destined love.The Fountain got mixed reviews when it came out for a short cinema run in the UK. Perhaps understandably because, although he is hailed by some, he is dismissed by others. So far my experiences have seen me fall into the middle ground as Pi didn't totally win me over the way it did others but I did find Requiem for a Dream to be as impressive as I had heard. So I came to the Fountain unsure of what I would find and not sure if I would like it or if I would struggle with how impenetrable the ploy summaries and comments did make it sound. At first glance it does seem this way because the link between the three stories (and the nature of at least two of the them) does make it seem like a concept to be cracked and pieced together. I do think coming at it like this will only lead to frustration. It is my belief that the modern section is real and that the other two exist within the book  this explanation helped me as it allowed me to focus on the emotion and themes within these sections rather than trying figure out the exact narrative reason for a bald man inside a spaceship that looks like a bubble.By doing this I was left with a film that I found interesting from start to finish, with the theme of movement from life to death and perhaps rebirth being one that was explored visually as much as it was in the material. To say it like this does run the risk of making it sound corny but rather, with this approach, it does work really well, layering ideas and themes to awesome effect. The central relationship holds the film together and, although some have criticised the other two threads as weaker, I personally saw them as being as much of the main thread as the main scenes were themselves. I was surprised by how touched I was at points and found myself watching a sci-fi with an intense human story running throughout it (or vice versa  I'm not sure).Some have said that Aronofsky's style as director is a bit cold and distant from his subjects. Technically I agree with that, which is why the performances are all the more important here. While the camera may not be about the heart, the performances must be and accordingly we get a pair of tremendous performances from the two stars. Jackman dominates the film. It must have been difficult to find his character in the midst of so many effects and concepts but he does it and, while you can see a lot of effort is being put in technically in some scenes, he never loses the focus on what he is trying to do. Weisz has less time and less of the material but she does almost as well  really connecting with Jackman and making her acceptance of transition seem convincing  something I saw as key in the delivery. Burstyn has a small role, while famous faces such as Thomas, Margolis, Curtis and Suplee provide solid turns even if their time is limited.Although he is cold as a director there is no doubting that Aronofsky is a skilled director with a great creative force. His control of the theme across the film sees Libatique producing a wonderful control of light that I cannot even begin to comprehend how he created what he wanted and managed to capture it on film. The space sequences will catch the eye most but I was just as impressed with the use of light in the present-day scenes as the use of distant light, being just out of the light etc was an excellent visual extension of the theme.As I expected, on the surface of it this is not an easy film to crack and, although not inaccessible, it is understandable why it didn't rip in a massive mainstream audience. However at its core it is a simple and touching tale, that is cleverly expanded thematically across the bookend threads. While the director and talented crew seem to focus on the technical delivery of the themes, they are matched with a masterful turn from Jackman  meaning that the emotion is right there the whole time, holding us in a story that is inventive and technically impressive as much as it is human.",,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"

It is visually amazing. If the theme is the transcendence of love, then the movie is fine. There is some religious imagery that could go the wrong way especially with the Mayan holy man.

"Ambitious, Moving, and a Conversation Stimulator","I was lucky enough to see a screening of The Fountain a few days before the official release date.The music was hauntingly beautiful.The use of micro-photography made the visual effects gorgeous. Still-shot images of this movie should be framed and hung wherever there are large groups of people present.I was engrossed in the story. It's complex, yet basic at its core. I literally felt the tragedy of the situation. And despite connecting with that tragedy emotionally, I couldn't help but sit in awe as the credits began rolling. I felt neither depressed nor hopeful as the experience ended . I just felt spent, moved , and incredibly eager to engage in discussion.I have a newfound respect for the talent of both Hugh Jackman and Rachel Weisz. If I see either of them on the street I will feel compelled to offer a handshake.I am convinced Darren Aronofsky is going to be regarded as one of the elite directors of our time before his career comes to an end.Overall, this movie is layered in intriguing elements. I've heard it described as a poem, and I agree entirely. It's like a timeless poem in that it deserves to be revisited, both in viewings and in conversation.",9.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
Congratulations Aaronofsky! You redefined the sci-fi genre!,"Easily the best film I've seen this year. Although definitely not something for everyone, as a lot of people will probably think it's difficult (which it is). But going into the film open-minded, and just taking it all in (the beautiful cinematography/visual effects, powerful writing, wonderful direction) you'll no doubt have the time of your life. It's more thought provoking and emotionally/visually draining than anything else I've ever seen (somewhere along the lines of ""Donnie Darko"" or ""2001""). I can't say enough good things about it honestly. I just can't wait to go see it again. No doubt a movie that will be talked about for years, and will probably be under-appreciated forever.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"

Just because you don't understand it doesn't mean its over your head,"What a waste of time! I realize that most movies do not live up to the hype or promotion but I had to look several times during the viewing to see if I read the right description. While I appreciate the cinematography and imagery of the film, it still really sucked as a movie. I spent the first hour wondering how they would tie all the ethereal visual crapola together into something resembling coherency, then when I realized they were not even going to try I began to wonder how they would end it gracefully. Guess what?? They didn't. And by that point I was not even surprised.Then what I found even more discouraging was reading the reviews here. What a bunch of bung. All those pompous morons who haven't a clue what the movie was about going on and on about how graceful and artistic it was. ""I didn't understand exactly what it was about but it must have been good!"" Maybe, it was just incoherent babble!! If I ever have to sit through it again I will turn the sound down and treat it like art, just slightly more mobile. And slightly less interesting.It would be really nice if people gave honest opinions here, good, bad, or indifferent. If a movie sucks, you can say so without flaming it or being obscene about it. People have a right to know. This movie should not be anywhere near the 7.6 rating it has, even if those that could not watch it all the way through did not bother to vote.",1.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
"Dear Aronofsky, Never stop telling stories!","""All these years, all these memories, there was you. You pull me through time""This was devastating. I never thought I would be crying uncontrollably here. I never imagined I would burst into tears like that, unable to get a hold on my emotions. This did something to me. This tugged at the deepest strings of my heart, made me feel vulnerable, and made me suffer, yet I fell in love and fell head over heels with the film.Aronofsky puts us in the shoes of a broken man who's sinking deep into his loss, grief, and denial, unable to cope with the pain, with his past, and with his memories. The plot poses some of the harshest questions out there; it creates circumstances that beget nothing but despair.How does it feel when your loved one is taking their last breath? And you can't do anything but wait for the inevitable to happen.How does it feel when their hands are slowly slipping away from your firm grasp, leaving the world you once imagined for an eternal void?What does it take from you when the only one that ever mattered leaves you on your own and, in the process, torns you into pieces?The movie goes deeper than I ever anticipated; the kind of emotions it evoked through its storytelling and the way it made me contemplate love, loss, and life through its haunting music are unprecedented.Movies like these help me to bear the pain; they aid me in taking respite from this cruel world; they transport me to new dimensions, new worlds where I eagerly seek solace and comfort; where I get some break from the monotony and ceaseless agony I have to endure every single day!Mr. Aronofsky, never stop telling stories!",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
The Fountain: Heart-Breakingly Beautiful,"I do not know how to sum this movie up in this review, and to try to would be an injustice to Darren Aronofsky's genius. So I will just state the facts. I saw this film at the Chicago International Film Festival. I was blown away. This movie is so original and so breath taking. There is only one word that I can use to describe it: BEAUTIFUL. Darren Aronofsky is a genius and the greatest film-maker of our time. He is a visionary, and one of the greatest script writers. Hugh Jackman's performance ranks among the greatest male screen performances in cinema history. Rachel Weisv is amazing, as is Ellen Burnstyn, and Sean Patrick Thomas. Clint Mansell teams up with The Kronos Quartet and the Scottish rock band Mogwai to bring us some of the most beautiful and epic music I have ever heard. Matthew Libatique's cinematography is breath taking. It is so simple, yet so effective and so amazing. Jay Robinowitz deserves special mention here because the movie is so well put together it flows, and as an editor myself, I can understand how hard that must have been. The three time lines weave in and out of each other flawlessly. This movie is so good I need to see it again in order to catch all of it, but this taste will be enough to sustain me for another month, when I will surely see it four or five times. This movie is about themes bigger than you can possibly imagine, and it will take some thinking, and it is genius. In my opinion, the best movie I have ever seen.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
Toast,"Let me say at the onset that I would like to recommend this if only based on the passion. I have a special interest in filmmakers who feature their lovers. This man is so deeply in love with this woman that you cannot but be aroused by the depth, the urge, the engagement.In that sense it is real, a love story that connects  and is as a result extremely powerful.But as a film instead of a love experience, it fails. I hate to report this, because the man is so cinematic and adventuresome. But the problem is that he structures his projects in ways that are supposed to matter.He built ""Pi"" in a way that was supposed to reflect mathematical hallucination of genius. He structured ""Requiem"" so that it was not only a story about the dissolution of a mind through addiction, but displayed in that manner. The problem is that ""Pi's"" structure had about as much to do with inspired insight as macaroni and cheese. ""Requiem"" was coherent, but the devolution in the vision had little to do with the way things really happen.This is a love story, told with love, and permeated by love. So he has that right, but where the especially considered structure is concerned, he is as incompetent as before. Its too bad. I believe that narrative folding of the sort he tries here is the future. I believe so because it can greatly enhance the power of storytelling and in particular cinematic narrative.I believe in a generation, everyone other than the nostalgic will be working this way intuitively. Its why it pains me to say that in terms of the folding here, its a failure. Oh, it has all the slices: reverse narrative: parallel narrative. One narrative writing (or dreaming or magically projecting) another. A life as planet, a love as religion. A death as life. A walk not walk. Expectations as beginnings. Mechanically, its all there.But it isn't connected. The passion of the story which really, truly makes this film matter is not connected at all to the narrative devices employed. It the broom playing with the toaster in the foreground which in the background the couple makes love.Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements.",,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
Good enough,"Philosophical film that weaves together three interwoven stories across time and space.First and foremost, Hugh Jackman's performance as Tomas/Tommy/Tom Creo is remarkable. He portrays the different incarnations of his character with emotional depth and intensity, capturing the essence of each iteration with grace and skill.The film's non-linear narrative is a bold and ambitious storytelling choice, seamlessly blending past, present, and future to explore themes of love, mortality, and the quest for immortality. Director Darren Aronofsky's vision brings a poetic and thought-provoking dimension to the film.The visuals in The Fountain are a breathtaking display of artistry. The stunning cinematography, combined with imaginative special effects, creates a surreal and dreamlike atmosphere that enchants the viewer.Rachel Weisz's portrayal of Isabel/Izzi Creo is poignant and moving. She brings a sense of ethereal beauty to the character, embodying love and hope in the face of mortality.Clint Mansell's haunting and evocative musical score adds an extra layer of emotional depth to the film, enhancing its ethereal and introspective qualities.The Fountain is a philosophical and deeply emotional journey that delves into the complexities of life, death, and the human spirit. It invites contemplation and reflection, leaving a profound impact on the audience.In conclusion, The Fountain is an artistic and existential masterpiece that challenges viewers to explore the depths of their own emotions and beliefs. With Hugh Jackman's captivating performance, Darren Aronofsky's visionary direction, and the film's exploration of love and mortality, it's a cinematic experience like no other.If you're a fan of thought-provoking films that blend artistry with profound themes, The Fountain is a must-watch. It's a film that dares to ask the big questions about life and death, leaving you with a sense of wonder and contemplation long after the credits roll.",6.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"

This is a masterpiece.,"This review will be totally superficial - without spoilers.
Reason is, I think this movie should be seen without knowing what to expect.
On top of that, I found that 'the Fountain' is a movie, that makes you want to dig a little deeper afterwards and that might leave you there, wanting to know more, go online and search for answers, opinions, thoughts... interpretations?
The first time I watched it, was with 15 years - back in 2006 - and I fell in love with it, right away. And I have to say one thing, right as we're getting started: If you consider watching this movie, don't let yourself be fooled by the trailer.
---With 'The Fountain' Darren Aronofsky created one of the most beautiful movies I've ever seen.
What may seem like a simple drama about love & death after watching the trailer, evolves into a true piece of art where the music, the visual fx, the acting and what lies in between melt together into an emotional journey that leaves you breathless - if you let it.
I admit, this movie might not be for everyone and it's most definitely not an easy one. The Fountain is filled with details you might not even realize the first time you see it. You're just being thrown into the story without knowing what's up exactly and you have to be very attentive from there on.Hugh Jackman & Rachel Weisz were delivering the performances of their life, with most people out there not even knowing about this film.Clint Mansell (& The Kronos Quartet) created the perfect (and I truly mean perfect) soundtrack for this movie. I've never heard a soundtrack that comes even close when it gets to perfectly underline what we see on screen.The Fountain is not an easy one, not a feel-goog movie.
It's meant to be watched alone, when you're fully there, to experience it.
It's when it shows it's true beauty, when you're able to feel your emotions to the fullest. It's an cathartic experience that The Fountain offers - and it's one worth taking.It's been fourteen years since the movie came out and to this day I see it as a treasure and it's still in my Top 10 films of all-time.And for one last time I have to mention the music:
It's so beautiful, it hurts.If - at one point in your life - you truly(!) felt what we describe as love & passion and you are open minded towards thinking about the cycle of life & death, give this amazing creation a shot!",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"

artsy yawn fest,"This is probably the worst movie ever made. It is like an emo kid that keeps cutting himself, but never goes all the way with it. It was pretentious beyond all measure - reminiscent of spoken word night at the coffee shop down the street. The movie looks like it was made by arts graduates, with below average IQs and armed with an over estimation of their own intelligence.I rented the movie because the back of the case implied there was going to be some Spanish conquistadors pillaging stuff, and there was, for 2 minutes. Deceiving. The synopsis mentioned conquistadors, a fountain of youth and cancer so I figured this movie must be kickass. In the future, I am officially red flagging all movies with the word 'fountain' in the title. The movie was so obvious, I felt confused at the end because I figured that I must be missing something. I wasn't, the movie is so bloody pedestrian there should have been a 'don't walk' sign over my television. The slow narrative and obvious symbolism made me yawn so wide, I almost swallowed my head. The stupid and lenghty emotional sob sessions made me want my kitchen to catch on fire, just so I would have an excuse to drag my ass from the couch and away form my TV.What the hell was with the bubble, flying towards the nebula? Did the director actually put that in there? Seriously, this movie tried to hard to be art-house intelligent, that at least 10 well read and emotionally retarded Starbucks baristas must have been consulted during filming.Anyhow, this movie is pretentious, obvious nonsense made for that part of society that likes to stretch 4 sentences of plot into 2 hours of ridiculous pseudo intellectual posturing.

Enlightenment,"In ""Pi"" Aronofsky dealt with the subject of the mathematics of the universe, and he touched on the theory that a higher understanding of this math reveals God, and in turn reveals everything about God's creations. The idea was based in part on the Judeo-Christian philosophies and religion, more specifically in the patterns of the Torah and Hebrew language.In ""The Fountain"", Aronofsky actually deals with very similar subjects, such as those of the creation of the world, and reaching a higher level of enlightenment. In this film, instead, the ideas and concepts are rooted in eastern religion and philosophy. In fact, having a familiarity with eastern religions would go a long way in understanding this film. An open mind would help a lot too.If you are looking for a straight forward film with a traditionally defined chronology, or a film that can be easily understood without much thought, this film isn't the one. (I don't say that out of pretentiousness. Sometimes you just want simple entertainment. My statement was not a judgement.) But, if you are looking for a film to ponder and discuss, or if you have interest in eastern philosophy or in the theories of the Mayan's higher level of enlightenment, this film is a lovely interpretation of some of those ideas.I've read some of the theories about this film on this site. In order to understand this film we can't try and follow a character as much as we must follow energy and life force ... or parts thereof. We also have to let go of our understanding of time and realize that past and future aren't necessarily exclusive if the meaning of time is changed or if the time line is no less easily maneuvered than a roadway. We must also realize that the film is just based on a philosophy, a metaphysical theory, even if it's a powerful one. A concrete understanding of the philosophy (for lack of a better word) can only come with a higher level of enlightenment, if that exists for us in this world. The Fountain is just a very good effort in bringing the ideas to film.Film, of course, is limited to stimulating our senses of sight and hearing. The film touches on ideas that are to be understood with higher levels of senses. I think that Aronofsky did as well a job as could be done to help us visually follow something that is not visual. He's definitely a bright, knowledgeable and open minded filmmaker.",,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
"Well, it is certainly different!!!!!","Firstly, I am a huge sci-fi fan. Having read the early rave reviews of others posting here at IMDb before seeing ""The Fountain"" I was expecting something a little better. Granted to those previous reviewers who warned that there are definitely spatial displacements in the time line of this story, the film is substantially over before a viewer can understand the esoteric opening introductory clips which are united with the closure. Rather than concentrate on cosmic special effects, the filmmakers should have attempted to produce a film with better clarity to the story line. This is particularly true of the first half of the movie and references to specifics of the history of catholicism.",6.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
"Three plots are one, the path to eternal life","+Cinematography 9/10 +Acting 8/10 +&- story & editing 6.5/10I watched ""The Fountain"" at a free screening yesterday in the local theatre, so I almost feel the obligation to write something about it, and do my part.Not spoiling the plot here is quite easy, as the film does, as is the intention of its authors, make you think, and experience--there is much to talk about. The plot itself is quite simple, but the message is complicated. I'll try to recap my thoughts on the film the way I thought about it when I left the theatre yesterday.My first thought: truly beautiful cinematography. This film really had some wonderful scenes and compositions, great (absolutely great) lighting, good effects. These were luckily not too overdone, perhaps a bit towards the end, but the film did stay true to it's intention of separating itself from the bulk of Hollywood(esquire) films these days. This section gets a 9/10 from me, and should be enough for you to make a trip to the flea-pit.Then, acting: surprisingly good. Surprising, as I haven't seen too many films starring Jackman and Weisz. These leads were very good, solid actors in this film and really drove the storyline ahead. Thank goodness Brad Pitt was not chosen for Jackman's role. Not that I am a Pitt-hater, however he would have stolen the show, and taken the focus away from what should be paramount: the film. Ellen Burstyn was an amazing supporting actress, and as far as I am concerned should get some award for that (I won't call Oscars, etc., but something should be in for her). 8/10 for actingThe story & editing: This is where it gets a bit iffy, and one rating for this section does not really do it justice, but I'll go for it anyway for the sake of simplicity. As the story is layered, it is always interesting to see how the director handles it, and how the authors push it forward. I would say that through roughly the first half of the film they were very successful in doing so, as this viewer is taken through a mildly-tempoed plot, where s/he really gets the feel for the actors and the cinematography. While the storyline does become clear quite fast, it is not intrusive. As this film has three plots (which are all one, see it to understand), it became rushed towards the end, as they are brought together. I am an advocate for making long films if the plot demands it to be so, and this one to me could have gone on for another hour easily without losing its viewers.Due to the not so strong second half of the film, only 6.5/10 for this part.The message of the film is an interesting one, and this is where I think the 'controversy' comes from. I personally do not think this is a 'love-or-hate' film, but you be the judge. I'll have to go see this one again to understand it fully, and before making up my mind on the final rating. For now ""The Fountain"" gets a7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
I'm just glad this movie wasn't more than 90 mins long...,"Let me preface this by stating that I have NEVER posted a movie review on here, and rarely do I rate a movie. I've been using IMDb for years now, and this is the first time I had the will to write a review.This was one of the worst movies I have ever seen. That's not to say that the story was not interesting, or that it didn't have great potential. However, it felt as though the movie was a short indie film that expanded itself into a series of montages that were so drab that I wanted to hang myself. I did enjoy parts of the ""conquistador"" storyline, but other than those 10 minutes, I spent the rest of the time, as did the other 4 movie buffs who watched it with me, in disbelief that projects like this get funded. However, it makes some sense since this project was delayed/scrapped at least one time (7 years ago). I was even more surprised by the comments and ratings this drivel received on here. I've come to the conclusion that people who enjoy movies like these enjoy them strictly because A) They make you ""think"" (which granted, is a good thing, but I much prefer PBS, books, and the news for that type of programming  also, this movie gets tagged as being ""intellectual"", but I'm having a hard time figuring out how the retelling of different ancient creation myths makes this film ""smart""), and B) it's ""cool"" to like artsy garbage with little to no substance. In essence, this film had Memento's brilliance of story going for it, but Battlefield Earth's outcome. Wait, I gave Battlefield Earth a 2 star rating out of 10. I regress.I had all the intentions in the world to write a nice long rant regarding why I disliked this film, with specific references, but I have just realized that I would lose more of my time with this horrible and egocentric ""masterpiece"".Unless you enjoy pretentious existential story lines and film-making, please avoid this thing like the plague. If you're looking for a ""love story"" in the general sense of the term (which I knew it was not), avoid, avoid, avoid.

Although in the description of the film it is said that the plot lines of different times are intertwined, but for me everything is completely different. This is much deeper than time or space - it is a manifestation of a person at different levels of his existence - the level of the material world, the soul and the spiritual world. Only a person who strives for spirituality can come closer to eternal life and the more we care about material things, the less space remains to the eternal ""here and now.""",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"

No luck!As one who has read and enjoyed science fiction for sixty years, from H.G.Wells to Bradbury, Asimov and Clarke...from Jules Verne to H.P. Lovecraft, I found this abomination to be devoid of any value. The scientist ranted and moaned, and most tellingly, swept and scattered reams of research documents in a fit of pique. Had the rest of the film dwelt on him gathering and re-assembling the papers, it would have been more entertaining.

Om,"OK, try to start with a positive: Aronofsky's Fountain was a much better film than Aronofsky's Requiem For A Dream. He always seems to be straddling the line between arty indiscipline and sincere message, and to me usually falling between both points.Grief-struck surgeon's wife is dying in the present, meanwhile accidentally saves tumour-ridden monkey's life with extract from Tree Of Life, while man and metaphor get mixed up with storyboard inclusions from the past and future. Well made, sometimes messy, but with some astoundingly deft emotional imagery, a laudable refusal to use cgi cartoonery and reasonably believable acting by the main characters played by Jackman and Weisz, it moves swiftly to the confusing finale. And with eye-cutting cinematography. Nearing the various ends you can only hope for the last pieces of the jigsaw, however none are given, but ""everything's OK"" anyway. It's arty all right, but personally true Art has to make some/any kind of sense for an afterlife – this will probably join the heap of stuff that is interesting and gorgeous to look at but ultimately fluffy and superficial. On the comparable thematic level I'd lump it with Buster Keaton's forgotten Three Ages – no one digs that out nowadays, and only dedicated film historians would look up Griffiths' Intolerance. The Spanish story reminded me of a true Art film, Hertzog's Aguirre. It's only going to be a Revelatory Experience for the young, inexperienced, heavy or intoxicated, the rest of us have too many problems. I eagerly compared notes with my daughter - but (thankfully) she was as confused and much less impressed than I was. We're dealing here with a fantasy that strives for authenticity but apparently with Mayans who speak Mayan with English subtitles and with Spaniards who speak English fluently. Those dazzlingly sparkling images of Weisz's full face as the Spanish Queen are the money shots!I enjoyed it to a point simply because I don't think that there is a point – it's a romance with lots of panache and dignity and very little swearing, sex and violence, which are always bonus points in my unfinished book. I can enjoy a Mars bar without having to know its chemical composition. He's a markedly talented director so I expect Aronofsky will one day eventually make a meaningful movie without trying so hard to be something completely different.",7.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
Life Changing.,"I was 13 when I first saw this film. It was one of many movies my dad made us watch as a family. This particular moviegoing experience was especially negative-I could comprehend the tragic romance at the heart of the movie; that was about it. The different timelines, the non-linear storytelling, and the profound themes were lost on me. Little did I know that The Fountain would not only become my favorite movie, but also affect me greatly as a person.I could write to the ends of the earth about the brilliance of The Fountain, but that's not what I want to do in this review. I just want this review to sway at least one person debating spending 100 minutes watching this film. The relationship between Hugh Jackman's Tommy and Rachel Weiss's Izzi is the foundation of this film, and I have seen few duos on the big screen capture the same richness and depth in a relationship. Every heavy hearted glance and bittersweet smile they exchange is so powerful. In the current day timeline, Izzi is dying, and Tommy is desperately trying to find a cure for her ailment. The Middle Ages timeline is Izzi's book (something some don't realize). In her book, titled ""the fountain"", The Queen of Spain sends a Conquistador to Guatemala. His mission: find the tree of life, and bring its sap back to her, so they can live forever together. In the ""Bubble"" timeline, we see Tommy in the very distant future. He is traveling with a large tree towards Xibalba, a dying star. Aronofsky crafted these separate timelines to intertwine and create incredibly profound themes. The soundtrack is beyond magnificent as well, and I consistently listen to it still.Any further plot discussion would hurt the experience, so I'll end it here. The Fountain is a movie that I recommend to everyone who I believe thinks deeply about life. It's not the most approachable, and if the viewer isn't coming into it with enough context or focus, it likely won't be a great movie watching experience. But if I hadn't given the Fountain another shot after I watched it years ago, I wouldn't have found my favorite movie of all time. And I genuinely believe I wouldn't have the same mindset in life as I do now.Thank you Darren Aronofsky.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"

"""Death is the road to awe.""","Darren Aronofsky's The Fountain is a film I've been waiting quite awhile to see and now that I've seen it I'm not really sure what to make of it. Yes, I am very much scratching my head over it, because the film could be interpreted in a few different ways. For those expecting to see a love story that spans a thousand years you'll probably be surprised to find that that isn't really the case with The Fountain. The film is set in the present where Tom Creo (Hugh Jackman) a neurologist, is obsessively and desperately searching for a cure to his wife's (Izzi) brain tumor. As her health is withering away she begins to write a novel calledyou guessed it -- ""The Fountain""; about a sixteenth century Spanish conquistador's dangerous quest to find the biblical ""Tree of Life"" (go read Genesis folks, Chapter 3, verse 24) found in the Garden of Eden.The majority of the film is set in the present day as we watch Tom try to find a cure for brain tumors and comfort Izzi; who's pretty much accepted her fate and is no longer afraid of dying, while Tom tries to save her he struggles to accept defeat. The film cuts back and forth between three parallel stories; the sixteenth century Spanish conquistadors, the present day search for a cure and the future, where Tom is encased in a large bubble moving through space heading towards a dying nebula. It is my own personal interpretation that this ""future"" storyline is really just a visual representation of what Tom is thinking inside his head during the present day events as they unfold. But I could be wrong, that's just my take on it. Aronofsky attempts to turn modern cinema into an artistic expression of poetry, only on a visual medium. It may be too much for some to handle, but it's nice to see somebody try hard to make something bold and different for a change.Visually it's a grand film, which as surprising as it may seem consisted of little to no CGI or computer effects. Those scenes taking place in space are actually chemical reactions filmed up-close in Petri dishes (cool, huh?). The film strives to be nothing short of a masterpiece, but I don't think Aronofsky's latest quite reaches the same heights of emotional power and sheer thrill as his last film; 2000's soul crushing opus, Requiem for a Dream (one of my favorite movies of all-time). Yes, The Fountain isn't bulletproof, it does have some flaws. Sometimes it can be a challenge to overlook some of those flaws, but they're worth overlooking in order to take in the film's vastly more important and awe-inspiring ideas. It's artsy, maybe just a little too much, and at times perhaps pretentious, but the themes and emotions running throughout The Fountain are so raw and fully exposed they cut deep to the core of every person, especially if you've ever known the pain of losing someone you held deal.When I first came out of the theater I felt disappointed, then confused, then fascinated, then confused again. There's no doubt in my mind that you'll either love this film or hate it; it's just one of those kinds of movies. But at least one thing's for sure  The Fountain is unlike any other movie you've seen this year or last or the year before that. It's more of an experience, a state of mind, and an exploration of the soul. Director Darren Aronofsky's film doesn't provide any answers, but it does raise a few questions and will most certainly get you thinking. This is an excellent conversation starter and I could see this as being in someway the ultimate date-movie for those looking for a unique challenge. I didn't quite love this movie (even though I desperately wanted to), and I didn't quite hate it either. I was fascinated by it, hypnotized by it, and even puzzled by it. And with a sensational musical score by Clint Mansell layered on top it's probably the closest you'll ever get to having a semi-religious or spiritual experience at the movies. Don't go into The Fountain trying to understand it using your head, instead try following through its multiple story lines by following your heart.",7.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"

A very good drama with a great idea,"With his beloved wife suffering from terminal cancer, a scientist works hard to find a miraculous cure for her terrible disease, while having trouble with the terrible thought that they might get separated way too soon. At the same time, two more stories unfold, one in ancient Spain and the other in space, all somehow linked, presenting the idea of a man who seeks eternal life with his beloved.It's an unique movie, one which presents three apparently different stories but which all have the same core concept. Each male character swears to do everything in his power for a chance to spend time with his lover, forever if possible. It's full of drama and emotion, presenting in detail the sufferings of the characters, their desperate attempts to fulfil their quests and what lies ahead for each of them. You simply have to be very though in order not to drop a tear, as this movie seems determined to make you cry with it's very well developed characters and its parallel stories.Although it seems confusing from time to time, changing the story almost out of nowhere, it manages to keep the viewer interested and curious about what will happen next. It manages to link two of the stories pretty well, this being the main point of interest in my opinion, but the third one seems a bit off. It tries to present the spiritual part of the story, but it somehow left the feeling that it wasn't all that connected as it should have been.All in all, I really liked this movie. It brought plenty of drama which makes you care for the characters and their fate, thus keeping you eager to find out how it ends. It's unique idea manages to be at the same time it's most important plus but also a bit of a let-down, in terms of connection. I had a very good time with it so I will definitely recommend it to anyone. It brings something new, a fresh idea, and this alone deserves recognition, not to mention the feelings involved throughout.",9.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
"Pretty, but not much of a movie","While I found the movie entertaining, I was disappointed by the film's structure. The film is about the fear of dying. The emotions were all there and terrific, with acting solid. But, the film is more of a metaphor/allegory for trying to come to terms with death, than a filmic story. I guess if you go into the film expecting to get a filmic poem, you may not be disappointed. I personally felt they could have kept the poeticism and lengthened the movie into a cohesive narrative story. Perhaps that was the original intent, as I heard the studios had the filmmakers shorten and completely change the original script. As it stands, the ending happens suddenly, and is a let-down. The message it sends isn't surprising, and maybe fleshed-out more could've been effective. It looks like the film could've been amazing. Still, the visuals are cool, the ride, while bumpy here and there, was neat fun, and it was never less than entertaining. Maybe there'll be a director's cut on DVD or something, I'm not sure. I'll keep my fingers crossed.",7.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
"""All these years, all these memories, there was you. You pull me through time.""","Congratulations Darren Aronofsky! You have just managed to break my heart again with The Fountain. A unique film experience - that is truly incomparable to any other film that you've ever seen. I would best categorize The Fountain as a cathartic testament to love and ultimately the frailty of life. The Fountain is not just ""another film"", it inspires a sense of spiritual mystery, awe, and fascination that really makes you contemplate your own life.Hugh Jackman and Rachel Weisz are absolutely marvellous in their roles, while supported by the wonderful Ellen Burstyn. Tommy Creo (Jackman), is losing his beloved wife Izzi (Weisz) to a brain tumour. Tommy is on the brink of insanity in the hopes of finding a cure to save his wife to the terrible disease. A recurring theme among Aronofsky's films is his characters with strong obsessions that drive them towards ultimate self-destruction. The story focuses on three different time periods, it lays out the three narratives as existing in three time periods: past (1500), present (2000), and the future (2500). The common detonator among these three narratives is Tom's love for his wife, Izzi, he would literally sacrifice his mind, body and soul for Izzi. In my opinion, a great aspect of this film, is that you can feel and breathe the stress, anxiety and pressure that Tom is going through, almost as if you were experiencing it yourself. The empathy that you feel for this couple, is tangible evidence that Aronofsky did a great job at building the story.Clint Mansell-the composer for much of Aronofsky's films- would reprise his role here for The Fountain. Mansell's soundtrack is intense, tragic and heart-pounding - and this score really elevates the emotional story to wonderful heights. The visual effects are absolutely stunning, a sight to behold, and adds to the mystic of the film. Another remarkable aspect of the film, is the sheer amount of profound quotes, such as:""For every shadow, no matter how deep, is threatened by morning light.""""All these years, all these memories, there was you. You pull me through time.""""Our bodies are prisons for our souls. Our skin and blood, the iron bars of confinement. But fear not. All flesh decays. Death turns all to ash. And thus, death frees every soul.""""Death is the road to awe.""""Death is a disease, it's like any other. And there's a cure. A cure - and I will find it.""""His body became the trees' roots. They spread and formed the earth. His soul became the branches rising up forming the sky. All the remained is first father's head. His children hung in in the heavens creating Xibalba.""""Every shadow no matter how deep is threatened by morning light.""""I'm sorry father, for you there is only death. But our destiny is life!""""Through that last dark cloud is a dying star. And soon enough, Xibalbia will die. And when it explodes, it will be reborn. You will bloom..""""There's no hope for us here, there is only death.""The Fountain is a film that would divide many an opinion, many would slate it, while many, like myself, adore it as a significant spiritual film. Darren Aronofsky would late admit that it was released at the wrong time: ""It was pre-Obama, smack in the middle of Paris Hilton time."" Aronofsky would reaffirm that the values and the basic principles are as relevant today, as they were when it was first released.

Think Deeply and You Will Reveal The Beauty Meaning of It,"The Fountain is a deep-thought movie about love, life, and death.

Not for everyone,"This chronicles several lives of the characters of Jackman and Weisz, who are always connected to one another(they were different relationships, but they always knew and cared about each other). It's about love, destiny, death, spirituality, the circle of life, nature and our fragile existence in this world. You won't completely know what's going on until the end, and it leaves things open for interpretation. This has been called a new generation's 2001: A Space Odyssey, and to an extent, the comparison can at least be made. While the running time is a mere 87 minutes sans credits, this does have a slow pace(there at those who'd outright say it drags). As far as level of detail, poetry of cinematography(don't get me wrong, this does look good, and there are some stunning visuals) and dramatic effect, this has nothing on Kubrick's film. The score is great. This makes you think(is it about accepting loss, or fighting until the end? Etc.), and the philosophy has some roots in Eastern religion, and explores the idea of living forever, present in many, perhaps most, faiths. There is little CGI, instead the majority of the FX are unique and organic, as they are, quite simply, not fake or staged... it's micro-photography of chemical reactions in petri dishes. The acting is well-done and the characters are relatively swiftly developed(they aren't lingered on, usually), though it really isn't the focus, and you don't go out of this remembering either that strongly. The DVD comes with a short production called Life on a Boat that I'm not sure I ""get"", and a feature-length 64 minute documentary called Inside the Fountain, which I will review on its separate page here on the site. There is some violence and sensuality in this. I recommend this to those who believe they will enjoy it. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
Cluttered confused and absolutely foolish waste of money.,"This film was miraculous. Never before have I felt like I have truly had 1 and a half hours of my life stolen. From the first confused minutes I felt this film had a potential which it never realised. The idea of a non-linear narrative spanning thousands of years, with allegories of spirituality and faith is very very promising. It has moments of beauty and so many beautiful ideas behind it. This film could be great.Unfortunately, the final product is a film so flaccid and genuinely unexciting that I feel my girlfriend (who slept through it) got the better deal. There is something unique about this film in that not only does its plot and script not deliver, but the performances Jackman and Wiesz are completely and utterly uninteresting, despite their working overtime in the acting department - no matter how much Jackman weeps and smashes things up over the limp Weisz the film remains utterly uninteresting.Ultimately the overriding pseudo-intellectual pomposity wins over the powerful premise of the film and the terminal anti-climax left me absolutely unfulfilled.Trust me, folks, this film is not worth the money nor the time and effort - and I have found merit in The Toxic Avenger.

"Does the quest for immortality make sense, or not? This movie sketches some ideas about that.","This colorful movie with beautiful imagery about going into an afterlife and afterlife itself is a great reincarnation story. It was a beautiful reflection for my wife and me about our love throughout ages about which we learned through our deep meditations. The quest for immortality of our physical body is as old as humanity itself, whether we talk about looking for a tree of life, fountain of youth, elixir of immortality or whatever name we can have for that. This movie portrays fear of dying and death of physical body perhaps more than any other I have ever seen. The inquisitor flagging himself proclaims that our soul is just the prisoner of flesh and needs to be released. While it partly makes sense to me, my wife contradicts that body and soul are companions. Protagonist Tommy is furious, arrogant and claims that the death is just disease, and he will cure it. His mortally sick wife Izzi receives the message in the dream from a Mayan elder that a death is the road to awe. Many dreams are messages from the other side, and anyone can learn how to understand them. I learned that through meditation. I would also opine that the death is just graduation from the school we decided to attend in our human body. And as such it can be awe and I agree with a Mayan.Tommy's struggle to find the cure soon become parable of famous Hamlet's question: ""Die, or not to die?"" Is there a secret somewhere, or solution to that question? I remember one of the old Soviet science fiction books describing looking for the main secret of Atlantis in their securest temple. When they finally found and opened the vault, they could read: ""The biggest secret is that they are no secrets."" Tommy is looking for such a secret both in the physical and metaphysical world. It is obvious that sooner or later he will be transformed. Imagery of a way to afterlife through tunnel, which is reported by majority of those who experienced it during their physical life, is simply stunning. How much that is a new age or religious conditioning I cannot judge. I did not need a tunnel, and I also avoided all groups and committees who wanted to judge me. If you eventually travel there, either for an experience or finally for good, I advise you to avoid them as well. You can encounter in them people who were trying to manipulate you already in this physical life. And I applaud the creators of this movie that they did not show Tommy in front of those but let him deal with his acceptance just by himself.

"THE FOUNTAIN (Darren Aronofsky, 2006)  **1/2","This is an intriguing but muddled and, finally, undernourished fantasy with biblical pretensions – one that’s undeniably visually arresting, particularly since it skips from one time period to the other (15th century Spain, the present day and the future). Another major asset is the evocative score.Hugh Jackman and Rachel Weisz make up the affecting central couple: as a conquistador, he searches for the Tree Of Life (Weisz also plays the Spanish queen in this section); as a doctor, he races against time to find a cure for his dying wife – eventually obtaining immortality for himself (hence, the futuristic ‘episode’). Ellen Burstyn (who had been given a new lease of life by the same director’s REQUIEM FOR A DREAM [2000]) appears here as Jackman’s superior in the contemporary sequences.The film’s non-linear structure results in confusion during the first hour – but, slowly, the various plot threads come together; however, the ending is rather abrupt. The conquistador ‘segment’ constitutes the best section of the film, while the futuristic scenes seem to be reaching for a 2001-like abstractness!",6.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"

Too much water in the Fountain,"The Fountain Symbolism, metaphors, more symbolism, and more metaphors can't even begin to encompass Darren Aronofsky's The Fountain. Aronofsky helms the picture as if he were Pablo Picasso constructing his most personal portrait to date. Unfortunately, the director does not make things clear enough for the viewer and it took several conversations with a friend following the film to even grasp any concept of what this film was ""suppose"" to be about. Aronofsky's heart is in the right place and it's very probable personal experience fueled his hand into writing this intimate portrayal of love and death, both lost and found.Trying to give a synopsis of the film is like trying to give the explanation of heaven and God. Spanning over a thousand years, the film tells three intertwined tales of love and our fragility of life in this world and the inevitable confrontation of it. Technically this film is an achievement on its own. Visually stunning from start to finish, the eclectic director who doesn't fail to surprise viewers or tap into something we haven't felt before like his previous works Requiem for a Dream and Pi; the film becomes so incredibly frustrating but at the end leaves you gasping for breath with its cunning, yet overwhelming finale.In 1500 AD Hugh Jackman portrays Tomas, a conquistador searching for the tree of life that God banished from the world in order to live forever with his Queen Isabel played by Rachel Weisz. In 2000, Jackman plays Tom Creo; a medical researcher whom is exceptionally gifted yet cannot seem to handle to concept of losing his very ailing wife, Izzy. Izzy is very charismatic and wise in her thoughts and words and has begun writing a personal symbolic fable to her husband. In 2500, a very cosmic and Yoga-like time to say the least, Jackman is some type of being standing by a tree having several visions of Izzy and talking repeatedly to the tree.Hugh Jackman gives his most impressive and broken performance to date. With his inner conflict and slow and steady realization of losing his wife, he shows us ""Wolverine"" has more talent than ever anticipated. He delivers us three authentic and genuine characters whose tortured souls are evident in their actions. Rachel Weisz is restricted and reserved in her portrayal of the two women Izzy and Isabel. As Queen Isabel she exudes the grace of any Spanish Queen in the 15th century, although how Aronofsky allowed her to keep her British accent but is a Spanish Queen is beyond me. In present time, her American accent is on point and she has the same on-screen presence that carries Kate Winslet in her films. Critics and average viewers are constantly comparing the two but they are two of our finest actors working today that resemble each other in structure and performance.The idea that Aronofsky presented to the viewer was a thought provoking one, but not everyone will ""get"" nor appreciate the picture. The visual spectacles are a marvel but the carry through wasn't smooth rather than being dragged through a thorn bush, screaming ""leave me alone, I don't want to know that badly."" The best parts of the film are Clint Mansell's potent score that always adds to the aura of Aronofsky's films. The cinematography is authentic and unique in pulling us through but leaves a rather dizziness in the system. And of course, Hugh Jackman and Rachel Weisz seem perfect for their roles. The screenplay however lacks very poor character development and not giving us enough background to fall in love with the couples. The director keeps us at a distance and doesn't invite us into their devotion to one another. The Oscar-Crystal ball tells this critic that some technical nominations may be in order but none other with the critics entirely split down the middle.

Not for everyone,"""The Fountain"" is indeed a very difficult movie to review. It's one of those kind of movies that doesn't explain much of what is happening, and lets the viewer come up with its own explanations.For me, the balance is crucial in such movies. It doesn't want you to tell too much, but if it doesn't tell enough, it might end up being too hard to follow or incomplete. As much as I love movies that challenge the viewer, I always felt that ""The Fountain"" is too demanding for it's own good and ends up explaining too little. It goes overboard with cultural and religious symbolism, so much that I felt left out because I simply don't know what it is referring to. I admit that I have little knowledge about these things, but despite that, halfway through the movie I thought it'll be one of my all-time favorites. After all, the build-up is promising, the scenery and visuals are beautiful and the music is fantastic. It sets the right mood.But when the movies goes about to resolve things it becomes very hard to understand why its suddenly happening that way. It felt like an absurd twist, one that could be argued to be either brilliant or lame. I tend to lean more towards the latter.It's a movie that probably anyone will experience differently, and if that was Aronofskys goal - then he obviously achieved it. I can imagine that someone who likes symbolism or has enough knowledge about this movies thematic will find much joy in it. But the average viewer might get the impression that it doesn't give him enough to work with in order to tell a complete story.",,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"

It's just even for just over 90 minutes, the pacing is often very sluggish, which made for a very trying experience at times. You have to pay strict attention to this film, you can't miss one little detail, or your pretty much screwed. I think I got a lot of this movie anyway. They are all inter wined together, all the three stories, anyway. The most interesting one for me, had to be the one where Hugh plays the scientist. It felt the most real, and to me was by far the most heartfelt. The least effective was the one in Midevil times. The imagery near the end made my jaw drop almost literally. I have honestly never seen anything like that, in my entire life. It was beautiful, haunting, and surreal all at the same time. The Fountain is far from a failure, and there is a lot of interesting stuff on hand, but it's just too sluggish a lot of the time, for my liking.Performances. Hugh Jackman is utterly incredible here. His multi layered performance is something for the ages. Each character he played, he poured his whole heart into. His chemistry with Rachel is what chemistry is all about. Together the two bring realism, and pure love, I was often amazed by the two. Rachel Weisz is excellent. She is charming ,vulnerable, yet strong at the same time. She has a hypnotizing face, and I often couldn't take my eyes off of her. Ellen Burstyn is very good here, per usual. She didn't have much screen time, when she did though, she added a lot of class to the part.Bottom Line. The Fountain is a movie I was very much half and half on. I enjoyed a lot of the experience, I was floored by the imagery, and the ending was one of the strangest, yet most incredible things I have ever seen. It just is much to slow for its own good sometimes, and ultimately that's what killed it in the end for me. I do however recommend it for an evening watch, just make sure you pay strict attention, or you will be lost.",7.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
"Worth the Six Year Wait, Even if it Wasn't What I Expected","I just saw The Fountain last night in a tiny indie theatre and have not been able to stop thinking about it since. There is something truly haunting about this film. I started watching it, somewhat familiar with non-narrative films, but having never been so affected by one as this one affected me. The film provokes something very human out of its audience. I can remember being one of seven people in the audience (having had a full house in the beginning) and still watching the credits afterward, sharing a very similar strange sensation. It wasn't joy. It wasn't sorrow. It was just feeling a part of something that I can't explain, and I think the movie is something quite remarkable for being able to do that.I don't particularly feel like commenting on the performances of this film or the visuals because that is all anyone has been talking about lately. Both are spectacular without a doubt, but what I would rather talk about is this very 50/50 split between people on this film. (Everyone loves controversy.) The critics in my opinion have been very harsh about the film's approach to the story and how they consider it incoherent. The Fountain is a film of its own narrative and a very original one at that, I would argue, so it is no wonder why audiences are divided, but the critics are people who should be used to this kind of thing if they are true movie critics. These people have obviously never been able to sit through a David Lynch film. The Fountain evokes a much more harmonious feeling through its non-linear narrative than any Lynchian film could, which is new for me. However, many critics (I'm directing this to those who submit to Rottentomatos.com) are calling the film too artsy-fartsy and accusing Aronofsky of being too pretentiously... Well, of course the film is pretentiously. It's art. Has our culture become so used to being spoon-fed basic plot narratives that we have grown an aversion to art when art is not necessarily coherent or makes us uncomfortable in some way? I am usually not one for the experimental narrative, but part of going to the movies used to be about seeing something you've never seen before... Well, I can't say I've seen anything like The Fountain quite before, so I consider it a success in my mind.Don't go into The Fountain expecting a typical film, because it isn't that. It reads more like a poem than a film and I can understand why the average moviegoer would stray away from seeing something like that. The critics I am a bit more disappointed with, but hey! Tenacious D and The Pick of Destiny is playing too and that movie is very enjoyable if you'd just rather watch a movie and not think.",8.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
"An absorbing tale, Aronofsky style","To know Darren Aronofsky's films is to love Darren Aronofsky's films. Unlike a Stephen Spielberg whose films are visually stunning without offering much in way of surprises or M. Night Shyamalan's attempts at cinema that have you sitting in your plush uncomfortable theatre seat trying to get one step ahead of the projection in an attempt to figure out the ending 90 minutes before the great reveal, Aronofsky is a talent that deserves to be savored both visually and in a conclusion that is usually unforeseen.His two previous efforts, Requiem for a Dream and Pi are two of the more complex yet wonderfully absorbing films of the past 10 years. Each film dealt with addiction  one with drugs, the other with mathematics  and the consequences of these obsessions.Aronofsky's new film, The Fountain also deals with obsession  the obsession for life and the journey of one man's path through time in an effort to resurrect his everlasting love. In the film, Aronofsky uses his celluloid brush to paint a picture of a man obsessed with life while dealing with the eventual death of his wife. Hugh Jackman - who very convincingly sheds his Wolverine persona - plays Thomas and Tommy and Tom, three individuals spanning over a thousand years each on the same quest. The quest to find the source of everlasting life. What is interesting is that in each story, his quest is not to find the answer to immortality for his own gain, but in each case, he is attempting to find the cure for death to save the life of the object of his affection which comes in the form of a queen, a wife and a tree (two of the three are played by Rachel Weisz, I will let you guess which).The stories jump through time going from past to present to future which is usually annoying, but Aronofsky spends enough time and energy with each jump to give us time to relate to the characters and their surroundings while making an emotional attachment between the characters and the audience. That is if you buy into the film wholeheartedly.When The Fountain first premiered at the Venice Film Festival, it was met with general hissing and booing from a portion of the audience. Then, in September of 2006, it was shown at the Toronto International Film Festival where again the audiences were mixed in their overall approval rating of the film. Having seen the film now twice, I scratch my head at the consensus response.Maybe the paying audiences were there to see the two leads, (Jackman/Weisz) who play the central characters in the film, without an appreciation (or patience) for the styling's of Aronofsky whose mind can best be described as Tim Burton on acid. Or maybe they were drawn in after watching the film's trailer which has elements of science fiction and adventure and thought they were going to be given an absorbing tale that will include aliens and lightsabers.Whatever the reason, few will argue that Aronofsky is an acquired taste that fails to transcend into the mainstream. For most, The Fountain will seem like it is going at a snails pace without any clear heading and can best be described like watching a Terrance Malik/Stanley Kubrick collaboration.But for those who like to think outside the box and have the adventurous spirit that can be whisked through time and space, this film will be right up your 'Best of"" lists. It is a film that is intelligent, stimulating, demanding while offering some stunning scenes that were done without the aide of CGI. In fact, Aronofsky chose to do the special effects for the film by using micro-photography of chemical reactions on tiny petri dishes. But special effects are not what this film is about. It is about love, life and being able to let go. Aronofsky style.www.robertsreviews.com",7.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
gosh darn it,"First of all, I would like to apologize. I am a terrible writer but I think these things need to be said.This is the reason why an epic shouldn't be 1 hour and 30 minutes. It seemed almost as if Darren Aronofsky assumed I gave a damn about the characters from right at the get go. Though the visuals were stunning and the acting was incredible I still had trouble connecting with the characters. BUT........... I will admit..........the second time I saw the film I was way more involved in the characters emotions...But when it was all said and done I was once again was met with an overwhelming sense of disappointment.............You see.............. My major problem was that to me, this film felt like an epic. Yet I was not given a chance to really connect and understand everything surrounding the characters and how they interact with their enviorment. SO essentially, I saw this film as an epic saga without its roots. It seemed as if the Aronofsky may have pushed his actors to perform so at such a high level knowing that he did not have the time or money to establish these connections in the traditional sense. I felt each individual story was in desperate need of a prequel........ when you have a plot that is as bizarre as this one, the only way to truly capture the audiences attention would be to set the film up with a slightly more traditional structure. I firmly each believe that each story needs its own 15 minutes prequel of quick story telling to help establish each character in a lighter way. Then after that you can pretty much throw us into what is already created and then I think we have a perfect film.............When it is all said and done and I can sum it up with this...................I WANT MORE!!! /sob /cry /pout /Iamgay /Iamsorry",6.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
"Cloying, superficial, grandiose and weirdly empty for a movie trying to be so profound","The Fountain (2006)A superficially ambitious, fantastical film that throws clichés like peanut butter--sticky, oily, uncooked bits of Profundity. I love deep, romantic, obsessive movies, and I couldn't stand this one.I think young people (or my younger self) might soak this up, especially people looking for meaning in their lives. For pure inventive fantasy, the Lord of the Rings movies are far better, and less pompous, and the Harry Potter movies have better plots and characters. ""Pan's Labyrinth"" has more magic and imagination. In fact, any number of movies in these kinds of fantastical realms have more going on. Because half the movie occurs in a modern hospital (with all its own clichés--the heart monitor, the dying people, the rush of medical workers to save someone) and because it's about true love that cannot die, the closest parallel might be ""What Dreams May Come,"" which has the life/death struggle and the investigation of what our souls are, what a spirit is, what life is.For me ""The Fountain"" was overstuffed with overused ideas of what serious, epic, mysterious, meaningful things are. It is equal parts wishful thinking and self-importance, with quasi-inventive set design (modeled after other fantasy films in its endless darkness, unwashed hair, overgrown trees, misty landscapes). It is also photographed with almost painfully consistent symmetry across the wide screen aspect ratio. I think this is meant to imply something grand and important, something with Eastern religious overtones, but it also makes the scenes static, even ones where characters are going through hugely physical, violent, or emotional events.Hugh Jackman? He's not my idea of an actor with depth (watch ""Australia"" for proof)--but then, this movie isn't really about depth, it's about the appearance of depth, the kind of depth a Hallmark sympathy card has. It's not like really weeping, it's about watching what weeping should look like. Rachel Weisz is only a pretty face here, which only cheapens the movie more, as there is no real reason for the Jackman character to obsess over her. Call it love, yes--it's a love story, technically--but you won't see any real love at work. There's better obsessive love with spiritual overtones in Coppola's ""Dracula"" fantasia.""The Fountain"" is not without interest, but it will have to be up your alley, to get into it meaningfully. Good luck.",5.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
I watch this film about once per year,"Death is a part of life. Most of us have lost a loved one, fewer have lost someone at the center of our universe, but that day is coming. Tommy struggles to accept death. As a man of science, he can not accept it. He is trapped between a world of solutions and a profound love that defies explanation. He does not accept it, perhaps for many years, then finally he listens to the words of his late love. Perhaps the reason he can not accept it is that he gave up the precious few moments he had left to his ill fated attempt to save her from the inevitable.Often we give up those moments with our loved ones. Some of us because of work, sometimes because we forget what those people really mean to us. I need this reminder about once a year, to remember how important my wife is to me, my children. They are my life and soul. Life is fragile, and death puts life in the proper perspective.Those that say Hugh Jackman overacted this are wrong. Grieving looks just like this. I highly doubt Brad Pitt could have done this. Cinematography and story are amazing. It takes watching the movie a few times just to get the basic message, a few more to figure out if the future part even happened. This movie is one of the greatest achievements of modern movie making art in my opinion, please do yourself a favor and own it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
The Fountain She Studied Science in Junior High School **1/2,"Hugh Jackman and Rachel Weisz are well cast in this film. Their acting is quite good but in reality, what are they really trying to achieve here?The film has its good moments when it is up-to-date with a dedicated doctor desperately trying to save his wife from a fatal brain tumor.The ancient scenes are absolutely ridiculous and are even laugh-worthy. Discussing tree of life, problems in Spain et al could have been avoided here.Veteran pro Ellen Burstyn as Dr. Lillian provides some good moments as an understanding doctor in a world of reality but her role is wasted here. Perhaps, it would have been more exciting to bring another exorcism in here.Jackman's line that death is a disease is a catchy one. Only in the end does he accept some form of reality.As for Ms. Weisz stating that she studied science in junior high school, my high school chemistry teacher would take umbrage at that.Life, as we know it, sure isn't a bowl of cherries as this film wisely depicts.",6.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
This Tree of Life Would Be Put to Better Use as Firewood,"The only compliment I can pay ""The Fountain"" is that it's not ordinary. However, a little ordinariness might have helped this nearly unwatchable mess of a movie.Darren Aronofsky has made a cerebral, abstract film completely lacking any ounce of emotional significance. It comes across as one of those films that one person had too much control of. I can't believe for a second that there weren't people around Aronofsky who thought this movie was completely indigestible bilge; unfortunately, none of them had the balls to tell him so.In ""The Fountain,"" Hugh Jackman plays some sort of doctor in the near future who is engaged in research to slow the aging process (or something -- I was never entirely clear on this point). His wife (Rachel Weisz, a long way away from ""The Constant Gardener"") is dying of a brain tumor, and curing her with these new but unperfected methods becomes an obsession of Jackman's. Meanwhile, she has written a book about a Spanish Conquistador during the inquisitions (Jackman again) who is sent by Queen Isabella (Weisz again) to find the famed tree of life. And as if that weren't enough, another version of Jackman (this one bald, looking like a cross between Kevin Spacey and Dr. Evil) floats around space in a big bubble with said tree of life (which I think we are meant to think at this point is Weisz in her immortal form) pausing occasionally to break off pieces of its bark to eat.All of this is treated with utmost seriousness and earnestness, and the results are ridiculous. The tone of the film is one of unrelenting gloom, with sombre music and muted line readings. Jackman is not nearly a capable enough actor to handle this role, though to be fair, I don't know that anyone else would be either. He mostly just looks sad and harried, and the only difference between any of the incarnations of him is in how much hair he has on his head and face (there's the hairy Jackman, the moderately hairy Jackman and the shaved Jackman). Weisz mostly floats around in a stranded role as no more than something for Jackman to respond to. Arronofsky apparently was able to convince both of them to take this nonsense seriously, and the results are simply embarrassing at times. My wife and I laughed out loud more than once, and trust me, nothing in this movie was meant to be funny. But the climax, in which the Conquistador begins to gobble sap from the tree of life, only to have flowers erupt from all of his bodily orifices, is a tour de force of unintentional screen comedy.Ellen Burstyn inexplicably shows up in a small role as Jackman's boss. I have to believe she only agreed to do so as a favor to Aronofsky for giving her such a good role in his ""Requiem for a Dream.""Grade: F",1.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
The Fountain is a difficult film to love...,"...it's messy and beautiful, it fights against its modest budget so it can preserve its message, it's intent on obfuscation in order to hide its depth beneath its lapels, it's clearly a very personal film to its Director and it's very raw and in some ways direct.
It portrays male emotion and the denial of those emotions in an open and candid way in a way that surprised me upon first watching.
I find I can look past it's messiness and see the very simple and very powerful message it's trying to put forward. When viewed as a film that exquisitely simply is an examination of what immortality means to man, told through three stories, exploring if memory, symbols, nature, medicine, enlightenment, or story can preserve someone. The truth is that some of these are a form of immortality, and some are not. To explain too much of it is to kill its magic. But I think it's trying to say that enlightenment is shedding the fear of death.
The Fountain is a very bold sort of cinematic poem, something from Homer or something as derided on release as Moby Dick, where depth and meaning are held within the journey and not always in view. It's rewarding when you understand it, and so what moreso because others do not, but hey may yet.",9.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
"The Fountain: A Gorgeous, Moving, Meaningful Film That Will Suck at the Box Office","And that's really too bad.Why do I think it will do poorly? The same reason as say, ""Solaris"" did poorly, which I also enjoyed. The common thread between these two movies is that it takes intelligence to enjoy, and I'm afraid the general public is short on this, often equating slapstick humour, a hundred gunfights, explosions, and car chases to be a good time.Not trying to be holier-than-thou, turning up my nose and acting all superior, here. I enjoy those too, but I also go in knowing I'm paying for some junk food cinema if you will, enormously entertaining, but probably not terribly memorable.Hey--I actually realized my example is more than fitting--""Solaris"" deals intimately with life, death, and regret just as ""The Fountain"" does. Aside from that, I can't reveal much else of the plot, because it truly needs to be experienced.Anyway, the movie was jam packed, but I think it's more because ""The Fountain"" was just released. I think attendance will drop as soon as people hear the news from naysayers, and I think there will be plenty of those.Some people definitely left early, and you could hear them complaining that they didn't get it (this sorta thing always confuses me, because you know you'll find out soon enough if you just stuck around). The guy beside me told his wife midway, ""I'm not getting this,"" to which she responds, ""Me neither."" At this point, I didn't understand the movie, either. However, it was still compelling, with so much to absorb and all these little visual and spoken connections, I was quite content absorbing everything. Speaking of visuals, ""The Fountain"" is indescribably beautiful--I don't doubt that I'll remember some of those images forever (just so you know, a lot of it wasn't even CGI; they were chemical reactions filmed through a microscope, and applied to green screen). In addition to that, the acting from Jackman and Weisz is incredible--great chemistry, sensitivity, and emotion. Score was brilliant also. Since everything was working together so well, I was happy to let the answers reveal themselves.In the end, there wasn't an answer, but a message, a bit of wisdom that anyone can and should understand, hard as it is. This was lost on some; when the credits rolled, the first thing aforementioned husband said to aforementioned wife was, ""That was a total piece of crap,"" and she concurred.Sigh--did they get it? Maybe they got it and still hated it, which to me would be hard to fathom, but his reaction was so quick, I'd like to think not.Then again, someone behind asked ""Is that the end?"", to which the addressed sagely answered, ""That is *a* end."" So there may be hope still, despite the fact that it should have been ""an."" ;) If you're into movies great for discussion and reflection, then ""The Fountain"" is not only candy for the eyes, it's candy also for the soul.",,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"

"Nothing is permanent, everything has its end in this Universe","We all know Darren Aronofsky is a specific figure in the world of cinema. His movies are distinguished for their controversy, surreal plots, morality and just the way they are produced. I would say Aronofsky's films are for thinking people, for people who are able to see beyond the obvious things.My first acquaintance with his production was the movie Requiem for a dream, 2000. I was shocked, impressed and confused at the same time by this film. It is not just a typical movie, it is more than that. It has a strong hidden message that you discover while watching it. Then I watched Black Swan, 2010. Since then I understood that I fell in love with this director. I heard a lot of The Fountain, 2006. There were a lot of both positive and negative reviews. I guess this is one of the factors that indicate the movie is not plain and has something that attracts people's attention and makes them talk about it. Finally, I watched it myself.During the first scenes you understand you don't understand anything: you see a conquistador fighting against Maya tribe and his queen, then, you see a bald man talking to a tree, this scene is suddenly interrupted by an episode showing the talk between a husband and his wife. When, in the very beginning, you see the change of these episodes, you can barely find out what are they for and what is the main idea of this movie will be. And this is where you want to turn it off and do some different stuff. But if you continue watching, you start seeing what the director wants to show us and you understand all these episodes are connected to each other.The central idea of the movie is that Tom Creo (Hugh Jackman) is trying to find a cure for his wife Izzi (Rachel Weisz) who is dying from cancer. He tries to fight death. While Tom is busy with his search, Izzy writes a book about Queen Isabella who loses her territories and influence, and her loyal conquistador Tomas Verde goes to the Central America to find the Tree of Life for his Queen. Izzy doesn't finish it. Before she dies, she asks Tom to finish the last chapter of her book. And the third story represents an astronaut Tommy traveling in the space in an enclosed biosphere with the Tree of Life. In all of these story lines the lead roles are performed by Hugh Jackman (Tom Creo, conquistador Tomas Verde, astronaut Tommy) and Rachel Weisz (Izzy, Queen Isabella, Tree of Life). And, in my opinion, these three stories represent Tom's search for the cure, and their message is that no matter how much you try to escape the death, you can't hide from it. The death of the Tree of Life, Conquistador and Izzy shows that very well. It's a natural process that you should accept and don't fight. The refuse of it doesn't make any sense. There can be other interpretations of this movie. It's individual. That was how I understood director's message.I can't say this is the movie for a broad audience due to its complex and deep plot. If you understand Darren's work and like stories with controversy and hidden sense, you should watch The Fountain. Otherwise, you will be bored by it.",7.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
Hugely disappointing and not nearly as profound as it tries to be,"Having eagerly awaited the release of this movie, I had perhaps set my expectations a little too high. I consider both 'Pi' and 'Requiem for a Dream' to be brilliant works of cinema, and I had read many glowing reviews for 'The Fountain' before seeing it, so it did have a lot to live up to.This is a three tiered story, concerning questions of love, death, the meaning of life and the idea of immortality. We are presented with three irrevocably intertwined tales - one set in 16th Century Spain; the second set in modern, urban America; the final set in the future. That's a lot to fit into 92 minutes, I thought to myself, but if anyone can do it, Aronofsky can.Don't get me wrong, the film succeeds on many levels, not least a visual one. The effects and the cinematography deserve a great deal of praise, but this is not the kind of film to value style over substance.As far as the substance goes, it's hit or miss. The main (modern) story is deeply moving, thanks largely to two fine performances. We feel every bit of Hugh Jackman's anger and frustration at the world as he tries to find a way to save his dying wife, played devastatingly by Rachel Weisz.Unfortunately, neither the dialogue or the performances during the 16th Century scenes, which see Jackman play a warrior sent on a mission to find the key to eternal life by Weisz' queen, are good enough to carry the weight of the premise. This is heavy stuff, and it is handled a little clumsily by all concerned and, consequently, never hits the mark.The future segment sees Jackman sporting a Buddhist skinhead and talking to a tree. Sounds a bit silly you may think. Unfortunately, despite Jackman's best efforts, it is. It really is.In the end, while the film poses some pretty heavy questions about the nature of man, and manages to deliver some very moving moments, it never really comes close to the greatness it strives for. Much as it pains me to say it, it really is a bit of a turkey.See it for the stunning visuals and for the fine performances of Jackman and Weisz in the central story (try to overlook the others), but don't set your heart on being blown away. Let's just hope Aronofsky's next film will be a return to form.",6.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"

The dialogue is also very well written and serves the plot very well indeed, with very clever devices used.

Aronosfky the auteur,"There is something going on here. If I were to say that I knew what everything in The Fountain is supposed to mean, I'd probably be a damn liar. That said, I feel that I got the general idea. Many people have compared this film's esoteric, pseudo-intellectual appeal to something like Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey, but I think this is a wrong claim to make. There are many moments in the Fountain in which the story is too desperately being explained to us. Rachel Weisz is an amazing actress, but God bless her, half her lines in the movie feel like she's just spoon-feeding us important information. It took the joy away from a movie that should (though mostly does) communicate on an emotional level more than anything else. Even if you don't really know why, The Fountain has the ability to provoke some powerful emotions. Unfortunately, it does not do much else.While watching the film, I sensed that Darren Aronofsky has become a director that believes in his own myth. People have called him one of the great contemporary directors, and now he has come up with this movie, which, at times, is just completely up its own ass. Fans of Aronofsky will no doubt love this and hail it as a triumph of the modern auteur.If you were to remove the entire concept of past and future from the movie, you'd have a story of a man with a love so intense for the woman he lost, he would never, ever recover. Since we do get the other, more wondrous aspects to it, The Fountain becomes a more memorable, unique film, and has a beautiful sense of hope to it. It is a very one-sided love story though. It is mainly about Hugh Jackman's character's experiences. Aronosky's wife, the lovely Weisz, has to play a character who is never fully realized, and is degraded to an object of affection and goal for the main character, and someone who lays down all the important information to get the plot rolling.I generally liked The Fountain, it had incredible visual effects that weren't CGI for once, it features a haunting musical score by Clint Mansell, good performances by Jackman and Weisz, and was emotionally hard-hitting. It's the the kind of film that just begs for repeat viewings, but it's honestly not as clever or deep as it thinks it is.My rating: 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"

A great film from Aronofsky and under-estimated,"I have very much liked all of what I've seen of Aronofsky, and judging from the amount of hate I had seen for The Fountain I was not expecting to like it. But while I think it could have been a tad longer, I thought the film was fantastic and my third favourite Aronofsky after The Wrestler and Requiem for a Dream.I also think The Fountain is under-estimated, it is a perplexing movie I agree but for me that was what drew me to this film in the first place. I find 2001 and Tree of Life perplexing movies, and like The Fountain they are not movies for everybody but I think important films. The pace is slow, but I was too taken in by the quality of the visuals, music, direction and acting to be bored by any of it.Visually, The Fountain is one of the visually stunning films I have seen in a long time, and I have seen a lot of visually amazing movies such as any of Kubrick, Kurasawa, Fellini or Malick's resumes. The cinematography is outstanding and the colours and effects are rich. The music is of such beautiful and haunting quality, Aronofsky's directing shows ambition and heart and the dialogue is thought provoking.As for the story, of all of Aronofsky's movies, The Fountain is perhaps his most philosophical and profound. There will be some people who will finish the movie trying to figure out what it all means, others like me will be rewarded by its effective scenes and ambitious themes. Scenes such as Jackman trying to find a cure for his wife's cancer, saving the Spanish queen from destruction by searching for the Fountain of Youth and sitting like Buddha beneath his cosmic tree really stand out, and the film does much with the ambitious and difficult-to-define themes of life, death, love and immortality.The performances are excellent, with both Hugh Jackman and Rachel Weisz giving some of their best work of their careers here. All in all, a great film. 9/10 Bethany Cox",9.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
"the kind of studio picture that won't do very well at the box office, but has 'cult' written (or floating) all over it","I wasn't totally sure what to expect from Darren Aronofsky's the Fountain, but I knew from the trailer and the buzz that it would be extraordinary- for better or worse- and it could possibly have been a combination of both. Walking out of the theater was interesting in and of itself, as I tried to process what had exactly 'happened' in the last ten minutes of it, which is so loaded with abstractions it gives Inland Empire a run for its surrealistic money. It's the work of a director who one can tell is so obsessed and drawn by what he wants to convey to the viewer that its bound to not make complete sense. No bother- the Fountain works really on a few levels though, some much more harrowingly and amazingly than others. One things for certain, at least for me (and I do need to re-watch Requiem for a Dream very soon so this could change), this is one of the best directed pictures- or at least most ambitious in vision and scope and purpose- of the last several years.If I didn't find it to be altogether a total masterwork maybe it was to be somewhat expected, or perhaps not. I still can't tell completely, but I think it probably has to do with the filmmaker skirting so along the edge of his unique, otherworldly vision of one man's search for not just life but a belief in it, that it runs the risk of running off the rails into pretentious land. One thing that worried me were the early negative reviews (i.e. 'Zardoz anyone?'), and the comparisons to Jodorowsky made me feel iffy, if intrigued, as well. If there is any one thing though that's compelling about the Fountain it's that we're given really an emotional context for most of the way, and a sort of bedrock that can be sort of fallen back on. Like Aronofsky's Pi- and maybe Requiem to an extent- it's about going past the limits of potential, or not even knowing what the limits are, in a certain goal. At the end of The Fountain I was definitely left with more questions than answers, and not necessarily in the greatest grandiose '2001' way either (befuddlement does need a little more rhythm then what comes out towards the end).But, as I said, I really did get very much involved with the picture, and the struggle of Tommy (Hugh Jackman, in one of his best performances), to try in the present day to find a cure for tumors, in order to possibly save his wife Izzi (Rachel Weisz, very lovely if not as compelling overall as in something like Constant Gardener). There's an element of the movie the Neverending Story, I felt, that came into the movie quite well, as Tommy starts to read a book Izzi is writing about a Spanish conquistador in a search for her Queen (also Jackman and Weisz respectfully), called the 'Tree of Life', as said in the Bible. It's here that the theme is really interesting to me, and carries over for a big chunk of the film. What does it mean for someone to believe in something so fantastical that it can possibly be? Can Jackman save Weisz after death? Can death be 'cured' by this possible solution or tree or whatever? Aronofsky might be quite optimistic, or perhaps not, the ending only leaves a certain hint of what may or never be.It's within though this framework that Aronofsky, with his technical crew from Requiem (DP Libatique with his amazing use of lights and close-ups, editor Rabinowitz for the different sense of pacing, and this time James Chindlund's stunning production design), with an added touch of magnificent, original special effects. From what I read not everything was CGI, which in and of itself is unique to me, that they apparently used what bacteria looks like for the certain ""future"" scenes and visions. But what had me all the way into the material was how Aronofsky pulled it off- even when a scene or two wasn't very well written (like some of the 1500s scenes) or when they just made about as much sense as a dog leaving a bone alone. One might say that it's too 'trippy' and hallucinatory for its own good, and as I said in the last ten minutes the onslaught of wild abstractions almost got to me. However I could never let go of how strong and commanding the visual style went with the material. And certainly filmmakers shouldn't complain much when seeing that a film like this, which looks like it costs a hell of a lot more than 35 million, cant make do with 100 million or more for theirs.Bottom line, I'm sure it will divide a great many viewer, and unlike some other of the fantastical films I've seen in 2006 (i.e. the Science of Sleep, A Scanner Darkly, Tideland), I'm not sure if it will really improve or seem more illuminating or revelatory on repeat viewings, and unlike Tideland it's not even really ahead of its time as much as it's in its own time-frame. Like its main protagonist, it's uncompromising and daunting in what it sets out to accomplish cinematically, and 90% of the time I was hooked in. And it's a credit to Aronofsky that his main influence, Jodorowsky, comes through in all its weird, mystical glory. I mean, where else will you get Hugh Jackman (in the space scenes with the tree) looking like David Carradine in Kung-Fu? Overall, it'a stirring, romantically charged piece of art.",9.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
"Mythologically targeted, but massively uninteresting","It's a specific enough movie not for everyone. There's a lot of mythological stuff that would be boring for most people, including me.

The movie has a hidden meaning that you can see. Surprisingly it is not dragged out, as often happens, and looks quite okay.The plot, although quite varied, will be boring for most.

A Beautiful Mess,"Darren Aronofsky's The Fountain is undeniably a visually arresting film, showcasing a remarkable level of cinematographic beauty. The performances, particularly from Hugh Jackman and Rachel Weisz, are earnest and engaging, adding a depth to the film's complex narrative. The themes of love, death, and immortality are ambitious and thought-provoking, and the concept itself-spanning different timelines and realities-is intriguing on paper.However, these positives are overshadowed by the film's execution. The Fountain feels overwhelmingly confusing, with its non-linear structure and abstract storytelling often leaving viewers more puzzled than enlightened. The narrative is disjointed, with transitions between the past, present, and future feeling jarring and incoherent. Instead of weaving these elements into a cohesive whole, the film often feels like a series of disconnected vignettes that struggle to find a common thread.While the cinematography is stunning, it sometimes seems like it's compensating for the lack of a clear, engaging story. The film's artistic ambitions are commendable, but they don't fully compensate for the lack of a straightforward, compelling narrative. Instead of drawing you in, the film often leaves you feeling detached and disinterested.The emotional weight that should anchor the story feels diluted by the film's complexity. Rather than being moved by the exploration of timeless love and existential questions, I found myself struggling to follow the plot and connect with the characters. The potential for a powerful narrative is there, but it's buried under layers of abstraction and disorganization.In essence, The Fountain is a film that, despite its admirable performances and breathtaking visuals, fails to deliver a coherent and engaging experience. Its ambition is evident, but it often feels like it gets lost in its own lofty ideas, leaving the viewer more frustrated than fulfilled.",6.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
"Dreary, disjointed and nigh on pretentious","The Fountain is a film that tries too hard. A non-linear plot device can be very powerful but the presentation here is a little too contrived and a little too opaque to pull the technique off effectively.There is a kernel of a really potent story; the anguished fight to save a loved one from a terminal disease. My problem is that it's so laden with clumsy and pretentious transcendental metaphors, delivered in that non- linear style, that it just ended up annoying me by totally undermining my ability to immerse myself in the movie and connect with the characters.For me, this film is overrated and just isn't my cup of tea at all.",4.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"

This Film Is Blasphemy!!,"Just kidding.It is, however, a little melodramatic and preachy in places, and the same slow, mournful string concertos played over and over again in the background tend to overdo the intended mood of THE FOUNTAIN. Another thing: Most of the setting is in the darkness of a medical lab, outdoors at night, or in the depths of outer space. There are reasons for this, of course, but all the darkness requires the audience to adjust their senses and heightens the somber mood even more. Just a little more daylight and humor in key places would have been a plus.Nevertheless, THE FOUNTAIN intelligently takes on some big heady concepts, most importantly, our desire for immortality. As medical researcher Tommy explains, ""Death is a disease, just like any other. There is a cure, and I will find it!"" Does he succeed? It's all debatable, and THE FOUNTAIN does a nice job of showing and telling us just enough while also leaving just enough for the individual viewer to interpret. There are a number of interesting hints regarding the possibility of reincarnation and, barring that, how we live on regardless of whether we continue to live physically and literally.THE FOUNTAIN seems like another obscurantist trying-too-hard-to-be-brilliant film at first, but if you stick with it past the initial 10-15 minutes, the three interrelated past-present-future stories come together very well. A number of other reviewers have described this film as ""a poem,"" and I agree. That being the case, it should appeal to people who like poetry, but those who want a standard movie-film may be a little disconcerted by THE FOUNTAIN.",,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
Misleading preview has it as a total different movie,"This movie is COMPLETELY different then how the preview portrays the film. The preview makes you believe that this film is about the legendary fountain of youth, the tree of life and back during the Spanish Inquisition days a conquistador finds and an lives on and on... but nooooooooo... First, I pick this film out to watch with other people and this is a film that either you watch alone (first) or you watch with people who have opened minds. I show have known better because it is a film by Darrin Aronosky (directed Pi and Requiem For a Dream, both excellent films). The reason I say you watch with people with open minds, because you have to be ready to watch a film like this.The film is very poetic and surreal. You aren't exactly sure what you are watching. You aren't exactly sure what is real and what isn't real. In fact when its over, there are several different interpretations of what you've seen. The film stars Hugh Jackman and Rachel Weisz. And that is all I am going to say because by telling you what happens, gives away too much and things have to open for you on its on. I will say this, it reminds me of What Dreams May Come, mixed with Jacob's Ladder. Here are some question this film brings up for me. Do you want to live forever? What would you do if you could? How do you let someone go? What would drive you crazy? I gave this film a 7 out of 10 because the film is visually S-T-U-N-N-I-N-G!!

A visual experience unlike no other,"Modern science fiction has been greatly influenced by George Lucas. It's become this big grand production of epic proportions. New age auteur Darren Aronofsky (Pi, Requiem for a Dream) has dared to scale back the genre, falling more in tune with Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Oddity, making The Fountain, starring Hugh Jackman and Rachel Weisz one of the more intriguing sci-fi films in recent years.The base story of The Fountain is about Tommy and Izzy Creo (Jackman and Weisz, respectively). Tommy is a contemporary research scientist trying to figure out the cure for cancer, which his wife Izzy has. He believes he has found it in an ancient Central American tree. Meanwhile Izzy is finishing her novel set in 1500 Spain about Queen Isabel, who sends Conquistador Tomas on a mission to find the tree of life in New Spain (Central America). The third portion of the story is set in 2500, where Tommy has lived for the past 500 and is waiting for the tree to enter a nebula and be destroyed.I could spend the entire review trying to explain the plot, but it's too intricate to do so. Jackman is still trying to prove his worth and talent as an actor to the general film going public, and after this and The Prestige from earlier this year, I don't think he has anything left to prove. He's a very capable actor, and his scenes as present day Tommy were some of the most touching I've ever seen in a sci-fi film. Weisz continues to push herself as an actress, taking on challenging or different roles than what she could take, and thus stretching her dramatic range, making her that much more appealing as an actress.Aronofsky is of the new generation of film-making, the millennial generation. Where Kevin Smith, Quentin Tarantino and David Fincher led the pack in the 90's, Aronofsky is in the company of Christopher Nolan and Richard Kelly on the front lines of 21st century film-making. He retools a genre that's become known for being bombastic, goofy and out there. He evokes drama and emotion from the genre and it's simply moving. I can't wait to see more of his work The primary reason Aronofsky is so engaging as a filmmaker is his visual style. It's not enough for him to present a beautiful and wondrous tale; he does so in a beautiful and wondrous way. The scenes set in the future take place in space in this sort of, bubble. The tree and some of the surrounding earth is floating in a bubble towards the nebula that was believed by the Mayans to be the afterlife. It's one of the most beautiful effects created. The Queens palace in the 1500 set scenes is just as stunning. The room was lit by an amazing series of suspended candles, and it provides some of the most aesthetically pleasing visuals I've seen all year.Aronofsky's gift for making an intriguing web of a film is a curse upon his talent that sometimes he gets so far into his own world that he forgets that the audience isn't inside his head with him. The futuristic scenes aren't made clear in their narrative intentions till about halfway through the film, confounding the audience to their impact on the story. But it's a treat to look at, so you almost don't even mind.It's a welcome step outside the generic mainstream, which I can only assume is Aronofsky's intention.",,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
"A lot of good things, but a lot of bad things","The film:There are a lot of things that are wrong with the film. It didn't feel as if Aronofsky was able to portray his ambitious story in the span of 90-something minutes. First, he had to deal with three separate timelines, converging into one at the end. It was pretty difficult to keep track of why a particular thing happened in a particular timeline and its effect on the main story. And in the end, there are a few loose ends that do frustrate me. All of this, in my opinion, was due to the severe budget cuts and the temporary shutdown of the project that ruined Aronsofky's initial plan. I can't blame him for that.But, there are a lot of things that are right with this film, particularly the visual effects. By using many tricks (such as macro photography of fluids for creating the nebula Xibalba), the future timeline gets this unique flair. We don't see any of the more technical and 'robotic' elements from most other sci-fi films, giving this film the status of immortality - it can be watched and enjoyed forever and never feel dated. I did mention that the three timelines were messy, but the one thing that united them throughout was the beautiful yet simplistic symbolism, such as the colors and shapes. This, combined with the cinematography, gives us some spectacular stills, especially during the future timeline.All of the effects and symbols, get their appropriate end during the breathtaking climactic scene. You get a sense of closure overwhelming you, even if you didn't understand much of the plot!Somehow, after Brad Pitt's sudden departure inadvertently caused the production to halt, after Warner Bros. Sliced the budget by half, Aronofsky managed to complete the film. And it was booed and laughed at by critics in the premiere :/There's nothing pretentious about this film. Darren Aronofsky's wonderfully ambitious story was just trodden over by misfortune. I would love to see what Aronofsky originally wanted this film to look like, but we're stuck with this for now.6 out of 10.The music:The complex plot leads to many questions for long-time Aronofsky collaborator and composer Clint Mansell to answer. How does he compose music for a non-linear film?Instead of composing different music for different timelines or different characters, Mansell opts to focus on the recurring ideas found in each timeline and construct themes around them, which sounds like an excellent idea. For example, the main theme connects the film's main idea of immortality and it plays on, and on, AND ON. I don't get the cyclical nature here. There just isn't any development in the repetition... until its deserved performance all the way at the end, in the track ""Death is the Road to Awe"". Oh wow, this moment definitely makes up for the dreary parts in the first half of the film. The climatic scene would've been incomplete without the stunning build-up provided by this piece of music.However, there's something so unnatural in the music, and not in a good way. Half of it feels detached from the emotions of the characters, which did feel offsetting. Plus, there were some noticeably weird transitions, and the mixing, especially for the choir, wasn't up to the mark. Again, like the film, there are a lot of things that are wrong with it, but a lot of things that are right as well.6 out of 10.Favorite tracks: ""Death is the Road to Awe"", ""Together We Will Live Forever"".",6.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"

What a mess,"The Fountain is one of those movies which when you say you didn't like it those who did like it get very pretentious and say ""Well you just didn't get it"". No, I got it. And I hated it. It's nonsensical, interminable and in the end quite laughable. Just an absolute mess. This film spends 96 minutes (and it seems infinitely longer) beating you over the head with how important it is. Writer/director Darren Aronofsky is apparently very concerned with getting across his point about life and death and the meaning of it all. Maybe there is a powerful message in here somewhere. Too bad the message is stuck in such a terrible movie.Trying to unravel the plot here is really a waste of time. Suffice to say it's a lot simpler than it seems. Really it's not that hard to ""get it"". Unfortunately even if you understand exactly what's going on here that surely doesn't mean you'll like the film. Aronofsky takes a pretty simple story and tries to jazz it up with all kinds of special effects and fantasies. But it just doesn't work at all. Really all this film is about is a man not wanting his wife to die. That's it. All the existential mumbo-jumbo surrounding that basic story ends up falling flat. Aronofsky was apparently so concerned with making a statement that he failed to notice he was making a very bad movie. Anything nice to say? Well, many of the visuals are stunning. That's something I guess. But pretty visuals can't hide the failings of the story. Hugh Jackman and Rachel Weisz have in other films proved themselves to be fine performers but they've got nothing to work with here. It was an admittedly intriguing concept and ambitious effort from Aronofsky but he couldn't pull it off. The film can best be summed up by one moment near the end. After being so darned serious, so determined to get its message across you figure at least the movie must be building to an eye-opening, thought-provoking, wondrous climax. Instead you get one of the most laughable moments in film history, a moment so bad you may well find yourself throwing things at the screen. I won't spoil it here, you'll know it when you see it. It's a moment which sums up the film itself as it's meant to be painfully serious but is unintentionally hilarious. At this point you'll certainly be laughing at the filmmaker, not with him.

"Fascinating, powerful, beautiful","The Fountain is a masterpiece of both filmmaking and storytelling - an examination of love and mortality that weaves together science, religion, and mysticism.

Izzi, meanwhile, is writing a book about a conquistador (also portrayed by Jackman) seeking the biblical Tree of Life. These two stories are intertwined with a third, in which Jackman plays a lonely traveler drifting through space in a bubble. Puzzling out how these three stories weave together into a moving and thought-provoking whole is the joy of this movie, and repeated watchings make it more fascinating each time.Even without full understanding of its complexities (I certainly haven't caught every nuance), the movie is a richly transcendent experience, gorgeous to look at and to listen to; the settings and effects are extraordinary, and Clint Mansell's score may be the most beautiful music ever put to a movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
An eclectic yet personal attempt to convey some form of spiritual enlightenment that often gets lost in its quest for something 'greater.',"'The Fountain (2006)' comes close to pretentious portent, often feeling more like a collection of well-crafted images than a cohesive set of scenes in an actual narrative, but ultimately Aronofsky's personal yet eclectic tale of a man fighting back against the prospect of death is never dull nor meaningless. It is often more confusing than mystifying, though, and it is easy to see why that would frustrate rather than delight. It's a non-traditional attempt to convey some sort of spiritual enlightenment, with its non-linear presentation making for a sometimes difficult yet forcibly engaging watch and its wild visuals making for some wonderfully wide-eyed spectacle, but it's most emotional moments are those that are the most human and it's unfortunate that these are lost in the search for something supposedly greater, and in fact fleetingly perplexing, when nothing could best those simplest interactions that come the closest to being profound. 6/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
A greatly underestimated work of genius,"I had seen this movie three different times already, but a while ago I viewed it once more, this time in Bluray. I decided to write a review after reading other reviews, to give this piece of art the credit it deserves. It is definitely not the kind of movie you want to see when you are tired, or having trouble paying attention. It is artful, not only in the way it is presented; with beautiful creative non-digital effects and engaging camera pans, angles and a sense of unfolding - No, it is also an artful way of describing one man's journey from ignorance to insightfulness that transcends the terrestrial and human domain.Like others have said, it is not a movie for everyone. However I believe it is greatly misunderstood because of the depth of the subject. It is important to know that there is nearly nothing obvious about this movie, everything is open for interpretation - whether it is religious, scientific or psychological.Hugh Jackman plays varied roles here (and does it very well), all with similar and different traits - showing us what the unfoldment of time does to his conscience, and how he finally resolves the conflict of death and decay which directly addresses all of us.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"

"Despite its flaws, it's still worth watching.","Requiem for a Dream director Darren Aronofsky switches gears from drug-induced urban malaise to abstract science fiction with this time-tripping symbolic tale of a man's thousand-year quest to save the woman he loves. Moving between representational stories and images, this meditation on life and death focuses on the concept of the mythical Tree of Life that is said to bestow immortality to all who drink of its sap. In one of the film's allegorical timelines, a 16th century Spanish conquistador played by Hugh Jackman sets out to find the tree in order to save his queen (Rachel Weisz) from the Inquisition. Another conceptual story finds Jackman centuries later, struggling with mortality as a modern-day scientist desperately searching for the medical breakthrough that will save the life of his cancer-stricken wife, Izzi. The third and most abstract concept finds Jackman as a different incarnation of the same character-idea, this time questing for eternal life within the confines of a floating sphere transporting the aged Tree of Life through the depths of space. Even more avant-garde than his breakthrough film Pi, The Fountain finds Aronofsky almost completely abandoning conventional story structure in favor of something more cinematically abstract. Though the film was originally slapped with an R by the MPAA, Aronofsky and co. re- edited it to conform to a PG- 13 rating.",6.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
Behold! ... The Road To Awe,"How does a talented filmmaker like Aronofsky take simple themes, such as the fragile nature of life and death, and turn them into one of the most meaningful films in history? Just watch The Fountain and you will understand. In this one piece of art, Aronofsky has challenged himself, as well as the viewers, to see a film as more than just entertainment. The Fountain is an experience, a leap into the depths of imagination that will leave you utterly speechless.Of course, a film like this is not without its critics. The Fountain is not for everyone. But I say heed the challenge. Try not to look for the realism and instead immerse yourself in an alternate world, one that struggles to reconcile the advantages and disadvantages of immortality.For me personally, The Fountain is a milestone. It was the first film (and only) that left me utterly speechless as the end credits rolled. It took me a few minutes to snap out of the trance of what I had witnessed. Now, watching The Fountain is almost a religious experience. I ignore everything else and dive headfirst into Aronofsky's stunning vision.This film has so many positive aspects that it would take forever to name them all. But there are highlights that cannot be ignored. For one, the two lead actors give stellar performances. I have seen The Constant Gardener, but Rachel Weisz shined even brighter in The Fountain. She is strong, both as the queen and as the ailing writer. Then you have Hugh Jackman. He may forever be typecast as a tough-guy, pseudo-Wolverine, but he gives the best performance of his career in The Fountain. The movie feeds off his energy, which from the first scene is genuine and intense. The thought that these roles were meant for Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchette makes me so very happy that the first attempt was a failure. They would never have been able to do what Weisz and Jackman accomplished.This film gets compared to 2001: A Space Odyssey quite a bit, namely the futuristic elements. But I see this film as entirely different. The visuals are simple, and yet incredibly poignant. The atmosphere of the film is very dark, but there are so many moments of brightness. It is indeed a film of contrasts, as well as parallels.Above all, this film succeeds thanks to the unprecedented score by Clint Mansell and the Kronos Quartet. Mansell has worked well with Aronofsky before on Requiem For A Dream, but this score is something special. It adds to the atmosphere of the film, as well as highlights the power of the message.When this film first came out, I was worried that the effect would be temporary. It was a special movie, but how long would it hold up? It has almost been two years, and The Fountain remains one of the most powerful and disarming films of the last 20 years. It is truly an experience, not simply a film. And though it may draw on themes that have been examined time and again, the uniqueness and effect of The Fountain cannot be ignored. It is a road to awe.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
Agreeably surprising !,"I did not believe any more that such finely worked films could be produced in Hollywood. 2006 previous releases had almost discouraged me of going to the cinema for US productions.This film can be seen as a touching reflection about Death, although one may as well (and equivalently) consider that the main subject is Life. Spreaded between three different (but deeply connected) fragments of time-space, it tells the story of a man fighting against the death of his queen, wife, and soulmate. Once again, it is also, as identically, a fight to bring to his beloved eternal life. The screenplay is built upon old Mayan legends about the origin of Life, and the afterlife world.The story is not told linearly, owing to the multiplicity of the time periods involved, and their mutual entanglement. But I think that Aronofsky managed to link them in a coherent flow. Some people might also be frightened away by the apparent repetitivity of some passages, but each one has its place in the narration (except maybe one or two, but let's not quibble). The camera work is well done and many innovative shots are quite successful. The director really strove to convey ideas and concepts through the arrangement and symmetry of some images. As well as using a strong symbolic language. The special effects are wonderful and fit very well with the cosmogonic dimension of the film.I was very impressed by Hugh Jackman's acting, which contributed to this film being such a surprise for me. Rachel Weisz is at least as convincing, in what must be one of her best performances. Their dialogues often get full of emotion without indulging in mawkishness.I will just temper my otherwise very positive appreciation in regard to the unjustified mixing of some Buddhist references and symbols in a metaphysical background which is meant to be Mayan. Which somewhat spoils the remarkable homogeneity and sobriety of the rest of the film. As well as the too numerous representations attached to the tree in the last time period, making its symbolic meaning fuzzy. But, once again, let's not quibble: ""The Fountain"" is first of all a very enjoyable visual and spiritual experience.",7.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
Do not read any other comments without reading this one.,"OK. guys, you can not go into this movie expecting to see full blown action movie, a comedy movie or a linear plot movie. This is the best movie I have ever seen. I saw it really close to the screen cause I arrived 2 minutes late to the screening, so there were hardly any seats left. The first scene really draws you into the movie, but after that you will either become, a. confused b. weirded out, c. (like me) totally buy it. This is not a movie for those who thought something like X-Men the last stand was awesome. It is not full of itself either like some of the other reviewers would have u believe. They just wanna sound smart. This music keeps playing over and over again, and I am getting the soundtrack. Ill tell you this, after watching the movie, I am still thinking about my mortality and those whom I love. Everything in this movie is not as it appears. Its almost as if all the pieces are are on a high up plane and they all just fall into place in the last 10 minutes. Beautiful. Beautiful. Beautiful. Do not think about the story to much but let the images speak to you. You are guaranteed to come out feeling ""warm"". I love this movie and I cant wait to see it opening night. I feel really sorry for those of you who do not, and will not get it. Only thing I can tell you if you want to figure it out, is just keep rolling it over in your mind and et the images speak to you. I would suggest seeing this by yourself so you will not be influenced by your friends.

Leaky FOUNTAIN,"THE FOUNTAIN Written and Directed by Darren AronofskyTHE FOUNTAIN reinvigorates the meaning of ""labour of love."" Writer/Director Darren Aronofsky's ambitious offering had many eyes on it from the moment of its conception, through its disastrous pre-production period and even more so now as it finally unrolls into theatres. When his last film, REQUIEM FOR A DREAM, struck many a chord amongst many a different viewer (it is a compelling plea to not use drugs as many people watch the film high and never want to touch the stuff again), people knew they had a young genius in Aronofsky. Naturally, Hollywood wanted him all to itself. The problem is that Aronofsky is anything but Hollywood. When THE FOUNTAIN got the green light from a major Hollywood studio, conditional to Brad Pitt's attachment to the project, Aronofsky found himself in a new world. In this world, budgets blow up to $75 million, stars back out, funding disappears and you can spend $20 million without shooting a single frame. When THE FOUNTAIN was shut down, Aronofsky would not let go. This is the film his heart wanted to make and so he scaled the budget down to $35 million and found a new cast and new funding. Somehow though, while everyone scrambled to get THE FOUNTAIN made, no one seemed to notice what a hard sell it was going to be. Aronofsky attempts to show in an hour and a half that we as humans are not of our bodies but that the soul, life and love are eternal; that the death of our physical bodies is both a natural and necessary part of what we know as life; that we should neither fear it nor fight it but accept it as peacefully as possible. He attempts to tell this by stretching his story over a thousand years. Though the vastness of his ideas lose some focus around the edges and struggle to remain congealed, THE FOUNTAIN remains incredibly beautiful with piercing performances by Hugh Jackman and Rachel Weisz that plant the seeds necessary for Aronofsky's ethereal ideas to grow in the souls of his audience. Despite all the love given, the roots could have still used a little more water.Jackman and Weisz play Tom and Izzi Creo in the year 2000. Izzi has an inoperable tumor in her brain and not much time left on earth. Tom is a scientist, a rational man who believes that death is no more than another disease that can one day be cured. As Tom tries to play God, Izzi embraces that she will soon meet God. Jackman plays Tom as tortured and desperate and his performance is in direct conflict with Weisz's embodiment of Izzi as a creative beacon of repose and understanding. Yet they still manage to share a life together, one that is clearly based on a deep and engrossing love that binds them, thanks to a tender, caring chemistry between Jackman and Wiesz. The present day chemistry needs to be solid in order for the bookending to fall into place. 500 years later, Tom finds himself traveling through space towards a dying star in order have that life that is fading be reborn in the tree of life he is traveling with. 500 years earlier, Tom finds himself searching for the tree of life in order to give himself and his queen (an earlier incarnation of Izzi) eternal life. It is in these two extremes that Aronofsky exhibits his strengths and weaknesses. The future scenes are organic and spiritual making his quest seem plausible in an other-worldly fashion but the past sequences, told as a story and not confirmed as an actual past life, seem stagy and forced.Aronofsky's ambition opens minds to new possibilities but it also takes on too much. A common thread was obviously necessary to tie three story elements that span a thousand years but he focuses on two threads instead, causing a struggle. Tom and Izzi's love anchors the center story but though Izzi is present in the past and future, their love is not the central issue. There is an expectation that it would be more prominent that is never fulfilled. Instead, what Tom cannot deal with in the central story becomes the focus in the later and prior. No matter when, Tom is always seeking the key to eternal life. Death brings about rebirth and Tom must spend a thousand years trying to figure that out. It is ultimately Tom's journey but Izzi is so compelling that she draws attention away from him. Despite this, the timelessness of his quest shows how fighting against death is an unnatural exertion that limits potential when one is fortunate enough to be alive that can also only reach its true potential by crossing through death.There is no dispute that Aronofsky is a genuine artist and genius in his own right. THE FOUNTAIN shows his insight, his openness and his innovation. How else can one describe the usage of chemical reactions in a Petri dish shot with a microphotography camera as the backdrop for the future scenes? The technique is even intrinsically linked to the themes of the film. Obviously the scientific approach is an extension of Tom's profession but the approach was also chosen to give the film a timeless feel and avoid the dating that can sometimes happen with CGI. But for all its ingenuity, THE FOUNTAIN never feels like it has fully translated from Aronofsky's complex mind to the screen. That being said, there are worse places to be trapped than the mind of a genius.",7.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
Poor Direction With An Ambiguous Conclusion,"This is the only movie that has had me wanting to leave the theatre. It is an interesting story that could have been accomplished much better. The stunning visuals only served to confuse the metaphor the movie tried to express. The film direction was stuffy and prolonged. Unnecessary close-ups stifled dialog, while unessential pauses and scenes that should have been cut shorter killed interest. Environmental lighting darkened the film at every turn setting a dismal tone throughout the entire movie. Changes in this lighting could have complimented transitions between scenes/time periods. The conclusion was overly ambiguous and slightly contrived. Any casual movie-goer will not appreciate this movie, and anyone who loves 'deep' movies will still question the quality of this film. This is a 'thinker' movie that does not accomplish its purpose and leaves you wanting more than just your eight dollars back. Few movies have actually earned my passion of disdain, this is one. Hugh Jackman's acting was great but, at points, seemed forced. Rachel Weiss' acting was entrancing, but her character was not real to me, not to her fault though. But all this was overshadowed by the lack of continuity of characters and concepts between realities. The film assumes the dignity of a deep movie and tries to dazzle with pretty colors, but it is pretentious in assuming it has a deep-inner meaning.",1.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"

It completely takes me into another world when I watch it, and truly moves me in a way that few other works of art, do.Please, just watch it.And if you're not crazy about it after you watch it-Wait a little while and try watching it again.

A different side of Darren Aronofsky.,"""Death is a disease. It's like any other. And there's a cure. A cure. And I will find it.""I think Darren Aronofsky is great. He brings a sense of art into each movie he makes, no matter how human, small, and individual his stories may be. The Fountain is different from his other projects, however, because it's almost wholly an art film. It largely leaves conventional storytelling behind and explores love, loss, and fear of mortality through reoccurring images, symbolism, alternating time-lines/realities, and some really fantastic visuals.I have to say that I liked it. It's ambitious and it takes a while to get a handle on, but it captured my interest from the very beginning. There were moments when The Fountain brought to mind a Guillermo del Toro movie, times when it felt like pure Aronofsky, and then scenes that reminded me of nothing I've seen previously.Hugh Jackman gives a commendable, fragmented performance as the three main characters in their three variations of the story. But it's Rachel Weisz who plays the only character in the film that we really get to know a part of, and she's the anchor of the overall story. I gained a healthy respect for both actors, while watching this.On the whole, I found The Fountain to be a worthy experience. There's something lacking, though. I can't say what it is, exactly. The movie felt a little too loosely connected, as if the theme binding it together wasn't tied quite as tightly as it should have been.I predict three different possible reactions to The Fountian. Person A will watch about 15 minutes of it, quickly realize it's not for them, and turn it off. Person B will appreciate what Aronofsky tried to do, but feel that The Fountain is ultimately a flawed effort. Person C will enjoy the movie and want to see it again several times, despite niggling concerns that it's not quite all it had the potential to be.I'm Person C. I loved the cinematography and had a very positive reaction to all the metaphysics and existential themes (which isn't always the case, despite the fact that I was a philosophy major in college). It's not the typical Aronofsky film and it's not his best (The Wrestler) or his most complete (Black Swan), but it's definitely his most ambitious.",7.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"

"Pretentious & boring, with flaky performances.","Sitting through this movie was one of the most difficult ordeals I've had to endure. I couldn't wait to get out of the theatre. I laughed out loud during supposedly emotional/profound scenes. It was all so absurd.To begin with, the movie has no substance. It has the most bland plot I've experienced. I wouldn't have minded watching a very slow-paced film that deals entirely with one man coming to terms with the death of his beloved. But this movie was plain absurd, with pretentious ramblings by flaky characters who invoke Mayan legends and immortality. Can we just leave the Mayan stuff alone already? I mean, I know Europeans went around killing indigenous people all over the world and their descendants might have quite a bit of guilt associated with it, but please stop fetishizing and romanticizing all these supposedly genuine indigenous tales of creation and death.Also, what's up with all the New Age crap (again back to the romanticization of ""Other"" cultures)? Are people really ridiculous enough to buy this clichéd crap for art? The soundtrack, and the repeated, annoying imagery of the protagonist (complete with shaved head and everything, in Lotus position), levitating and contained within some vesicle/floating globulet. God, even someone from grade 4 could be challenged to come up with more imaginative and creative stuff. What a bunch of fluff. The fact that audiences might appreciate this film scares me. I want to feel that people are more demanding than that.I felt there wasn't a single genuine moment in this film. I was never able to identify with any component of the film, let alone the characters. Now, I am not by any means a film snob - I enjoy a huge range of films of several varieties. The genre is dear to me - funny films, romance films, slow films, action films, artfully done films, experimental films, etc. But I can't stress enough that this film is terrible in its conception and execution.",1.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
"Interesting story about fighting a loved one's impending death gets the ""Wow, I'm deep"" treatment","Aronofsky has a great talent at depicting the human condition in time of extreme emotional desperation. The modern day scenes with Jackman and Weisz are absolutely excellent, the dramatizations of the unfinished Conquistador story are good and the man in the space bubble sequences are interesting but conceptually flimsy. While the space settings may get labeled ""Sci-Fi"", it isn't. It's apparently a representation of Jackman's character's mental state as time runs out for his sick wife. Beautiful and ugly at the same time.Unfortunately, the attempt to combine Mayan imagery, Tai Chi Chuan and a basic Yoga posture comes off on the level of a second year film school production. And the scenes of the man peeling human hair covered bark off the space bubble tree and eating it seem out of a David Lynch film. Weird and needlessly disturbing.After the great ""Requiem for a Dream"" I had hoped that director had these sort of self- indulgent mistakes out of his system. While only 90 minutes long, it could have benefited with about ten minutes edited from the space bubble sequences, especially at the very end. Like his first film, ""Pi"", Aronofsky seems to have a problem cutting to the chase, so to speak.Regardless, it's a very interesting film if you are prepared for it.",7.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
A Deceptive Trip of a Promising Director,"When ""Requiem for a Dream"" was released in Brazil, Darren Aronofsky became a sensation among the lovers of cinema. The cult ""Pi"" was immediately released on the trail of the success of ""Requiem for a Dream"". I confess that I had great expectations with ""The Fountain"" and I usually categorized Darren Aronofsky, together with Alejandro Amenábar and Alejandro González Iñárritu, the three best new directors of the cinema industry. However, the visually beautiful ""The Fountain"" is a boring mess, actually a deceptive trip of a promising director. Individually, the story of the scientist researching the cure of cancer to save his wife Izzi using a South American tree and a monkey is nice; he spends more time in the laboratory than with his beloved wife, and when he finds the cure, it is too late to recover the lost time that he could have spent with Izzi. The story in the medieval Spain that Izzi is writing is also attractive. However, the story of the man in a bubble in outer space is surrealist and seems to be the inner feelings of the scientist trying to save his love. Unfortunately the interconnection of the three stories never works. I hope that Darren Aronofsky has a different fate from M. Night Shyamalan, who made the successful ""The Sixth Sense"" in the beginning of his career and deceptive movies later on. My vote is four.Title (Brazil): ""Fonte da Vida"" (""Fountain of the Life"")",4.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
Exquisite,"This movie is many things. First and foremost it is a powerful and emotional movie which if viewed by an active viewer will shake them to their core. It explores love, and mortality in ways no other film I've ever seen has. Secondly it is the most aesthetically beautiful film I've ever seen. Their have been a lot of advances in technology in film over the past decade, this is the first movie I've ever seen that has used that technology to create an emotional and dramatic effect instead of just a shock and awe spectacle. The movie is out of sequence and is hard to follow at times. But if you wait for the conclusion the film reveals itself and any confusion you had initially was well worth the culmination of the three story lines at the end. Hugh Jackman has an intensity that I couldn't imagine another actor bringing to the part while Rachel Weis is ethereal. I have trouble ranking this in terms of other movies I've seen because there are no films that are like it. Hopefully that will change.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"

The conclusion that the eternal life in this world is impossible, or even if it becomes almost possible is meaningless, is another marvellous insight. The movie does not give the way but it can help for certain realizations for the real seekers. Serious movie that is a must to see. The real average rating should be over 8.",,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
"Life, death, love, I'm okay with those things","""Spanning over one thousand years, and three parallel stories, The Fountain is a story of love, death, spirituality, and the fragility of our existence in this world.""I confess myself not a fan of Aronofsky, and this ambitious excursion into sci-fi metaphysics does nothing to banish my previous annoyance at his muddy avant-gardism (Pi) and his simpleminded tract on drugs that unaccountably was greeted as hip (Requiem for a Dream). After a longish pause, he has taken another direction, one of greater ambition but no greater clarity or good sense. He now has a beautiful girlfriend, mother of his child, Academy Award winner Rachel Weisz, whom he's made the center of a movie aboutwhat? You be the judge, but obviously it touches on modest topics like love, death, spirituality, and the fragility of our existence in this world, seeking to encompass them through a three-pronged story-line about:1. A present-day medical researcher, Tommy Oreo (Hugh Jackman), working on monkeys with brain tumors in hopes of finding a cure for his wife Izzi's (Wiesz's) tumor; she has one too. This leads to some medically and scientifically questionable procedures (unlikely ones too) which a distinguished supervisor, Dr. Lillian Guzetti (Ellen Burstyn) strenuously disapproves of.2. A Spanish explorer, Tomas (Jackman, looking for the fountain of life (or youth) in Latin America, urged on by Queen Isabel (Weisz), with trouble afoot from Grand Inquisitor Silecio (Stephen McHattie). Encounters with Mayan hierophants dressed up like in Apocalypto also occur. Thre's some hand-to-hand combat, but nobody's heart gets ripped out.3. Meanwhile in the future sometime a sort of astronaut or guru is floating in outer space, sometimes in the yoga position. His name is Tommy (Jackman) and his guiding spirit is ..you guessed it, Izzi (Weisz). He seems to be the custodian of a magical tree.Variations in chevelure distinguish the two stars in the separate time-frames. In sequence 1, Jackman has the unshaven look, with a down-flop hairdo. In No. 2, he's lushly bearded. In 3, he's as bald as an egg. Weisz's hair lengths vary appropriately.Now, themes do emerge, and they're grand. ""Death is an act of creation,"" the Maya priest (who's into killing people) says. ""What if you could live forever?""""Death is a disease, like any other,"" medical researcher Tommy shouts. ""Death frees every soul,"" somebody says. Tomas samples the sap from a magical tree. Dropped on the ground it makes a stripling spring up instantly covered with leaves. Tomas applies it to a wound and the wound closes. He drinks a big glob of it and that is a big mistake. He's covered with striplings, springing out of his body. Back to the drawing board on that one.The plight of researcher Tommy and his brave but doomed wife Izzi gets most of the screen time, and this is the segment that is easiest to parse into a narrative (though it's corny and punctuated with vapid dialogue), while not only is the development of the other segments spotty, their relationship to each other and the main plot remains incoherent, at most symbolic.Jackman is a good sport; it's not his fault that his futuristic guru and his conquistador are mere fragments and his recurrent stints as the nervous researcher are stagy and less convincing than a TV hospital series. Weisz is a radiant beauty and a warm presence; she has a few moments when her emotions seem real. Her Spanish queen is just a static cameo. Ellen Burstyn adds class to a minor role. It's hard to speak of direction.The uncertainty of this project is indicated by the fact that it is an attempt to redo a glossier one for which Warner Brothers put up $75 million (of which $20 million was spent), and which was to star Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett. Irreconcilable difference between Pitt and Aronofsky were cited. Brad and Cate apparently went off to do the equally over-ambitious but infinitely superior Babel This pickup version was made for less than half the original budget. It appears corners were cut on the lighting. It is dim. The movie itself is a murky mess.This is one genius whose mind I don't want to be trapped inside of.",6.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
The words to express the inexpressible: The Fountain,"This is my first review on any movie anywhere. But after watching this movie for the first time, some months ago already, I knew I had to give you my words to describe this masterpiece.The story, I will not tell.. The words will not let me, my own understanding of this film simply falls short, to accurately portray the story. You most likely have read the reviews, and are aware of the lead characters and the 3 time-lines.And that's where the impossibility of reviewing a movie like this shows itself, everything in this film is intertwined, and has hard to grasp as some famous Escher (whose known for his mind boggling pieces) art works. The difference with Escher and Aronofsky, is that Aronofsky presents us the possibility, no the opportunity to actually experience the complexity of the artwork in question. To touch one subject of this film, is to touch seven other subjects that are linked to it. This has been made so you can experience the full value of that one subject you just touched, the depth, the complexity. And your rational mind will have one of the hardest times ever, to really 'get' this movie.To me, getting this movie, is by far not as important as experiencing it. Art cannot be conveyed in words, it is experienced (felt), or it is not. Which is in itself, is the biggest and toughest praise an artist can get for his or her creation. The toughness of this praise is the fact that it asks allot from the viewer to properly judge the movie as it deserves. Meaning you have a very clear split between the fans and the 'boo-ers'.This movie is flawless for the right viewer. It touches many many subjects: Eternal life, death, disease, acceptance, grievance, love, Mayan myths, spirituality, enlightenment, science, frustration, life. And most likely many, many more. The difficulty (as with an Escher painting) is that every subject, is at the same time the object of the movie but also each subject is complimentary towards all the other subjects. The result of this complimentary property is a flawless experience of the worth of each of those subjects in their united web which we call: The fountain.This review isn't for your average reader i'm sure but neither is this movie. So if you get this review.. don't hesitate in watching the movie, and let go of everything you have ever read about it :), as words could never try and hope to convey, what the movie beautifully does.Thanks for taking the time reading this, I hope it was an OK read.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
"Visual poetry, and poetry is not for everyone.","I just saw this movie and it is one of the best movies I have ever seen. It's the emotional equivalent to Requiem For a Dream, but the subject matter is obviously very different.Let me first say that this movie is not for everyone. It's for people who don't like to have plot lines shoved down their throats. It's for people who like to think and talk about the movie they've just seen with their friends. It's for people to look back on and try to pull apart the pieces to see where it all fits. The message is clear, the story can be confusing at times, and it's almost open for interpretation by the end.This movie is truly visual poetry. After seeing it, I feel like I've just come away from a very strange but magnificent poem that dealt with life, love, and death. Don't go in expecting a straightforward story full of action and suspense. Expect poetry. Something visually and audibly beautiful.I have newfound respect for Hugh Jackman as an actor. His performance was just incredible as, essentially, three different roles. I thought he was more of a one trick pony, but I was obviously wrong.Darren Aronofsky has created a masterpiece to a select group of movie goers.

"Extraordinarlily ambitious, but a failure all the same.","This is an extraordinary film in so many ways which doesn't necessarily mean that it's a good one. Indeed, it is a failure but an ambitious, over-reaching one with bits here and there that really are amazing. It has had a troubled history. At one point the film was 'scrapped' and started over, it's leading actor recast. This is just one of the many unfortunate elements of the finished product since Hugh Jackman's performance is largely inadequate.The film follows three separate stories linked by, what we must assume are, the same pair of lovers played by the same performers, one set at the time of the conquistadors, the other in the present and the third in the distant future. It all has to do with the Tree of Life, (you know, the one from the Garden of Eden), love through eternity, conquering death and all that. The ideas themselves are fine but they don't gel; the film's troubled history is all too obvious. This feels like a film that has been badly chopped about, (maybe it hasn't; maybe this was all Aronofsky wanted), and the pretty terrible acting of all concerned doesn't help.Yet there is considerable imagination here and visually certain scenes take the breath away. The medieval sequences are sumptuous and the scenes set in 'deep space' are often magnificent. It's the 'middle' story that is mundane and yet these scenes are the anchor for everything else that happens. The stories are inter-linked so we keep moving back and forth in time until finally we tire of the dull central yarn. I didn't like Aronofsky's hyper-kinetic drugs movie ""Requiem for a Dream"". At least, this time round he showed, in tantalizing glimpses, just what a fine film-maker he can be ... and then he blew it.",6.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
This is one of those cases where you CAN trust the box office numbers.,"I _HATED_ this movie.Now understand, I was really looking forward to it coming out, but I am telling you, I have NEVER experienced this kind of a disappointment at the theater. It reminded me of one of those direct-to-TV Sci-Fi type productions - I kid you not.The trailers and late-night promos led me to believe this would be an epic type action movie, but nothing could have been further from the truth. While I find those types of movies entertaining, I also enjoy slower paced movies that make you think as well. This movie failed on both counts.Don't get me wrong, the acting was top notch, no complaints there. It was also filmed in a very interesting way, but it was over the top. I felt like I wanted to stand up and scream ""OK! I get it, you are trying to come up with interesting scenes and angles - enough already!"" It just was a bit much.Here are the reasons I didn't like it.#1, There IS no story here. Looking back, I am kinda scratching my head trying to figure out how it possibly was a full-length movie, because going from memory, it seems like 15 minutes worth of events. I was SO sick of seeing the same shots OVER and OVER again, and hearing the same lines repeated as though they carried the weight of the world...it was just wearing.I am not a student of cinematography working on a class project. I don't want to spend the next few days trying to figure out what in the world was going on. I want to be entertained, moved, or influenced in some way, not annoyed at the waste of money and Saturday evening. Guess which one of those this movie succeeded at...#2, The message doesn't get much more simple. Yeah, stuff dies, circle of life, blah. Congratulations, you can join The Lion King as a film of incredible gravity.#3, Whatever the heck was going on in this train wreck of a film, there definitely was no reason to hop around as much as it did. Even for whatever (I think) it was trying to accomplish, it was just cumbersome and felt sloppy.I have never used drugs, but I imagine the experience to be something like watching this film. So if you are a user/former user, this could potentially be a cheaper and safer trip for you.Honestly, it just felt like the kind of thing that makes dull people feel intelligent/insightful. After seeing it, they can then go on and on about what they see or how it speaks to them or some nonsense that will distinguish them from everyone else -- at least in their own minds.Unfortunately, the reality that this is basically like an abstract painting of nothing put to film.",2.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
Beautiful Expressed,"I must say it took me 6 weeks to get this film into my hands. Every time I went to Blockbuster to inquire about this film; I was told they didn't have it in stock and they only had 2-3 copies of the DVD. Also some person of non-film value would tell me, ""You won't like it, it's a waste of time"" Did I ask him for his review? Did I ask him to tell me what he thought! So I kindly told the Manager that it's not proper to tell someone whether they would like a film and it's just RUDE. As a film writer and movie buff, I prefer to make my own decision when reviewing a film. So after the 4 week of trying to get this film I ask the store manager, So since this movie is so bad, Why you don't never have the movie in stock or available. Don't you think that if people didn't like a movie they would not view it. Well of course he couldn't answer my question. So we eventually got the chance to get the movie 6 weeks later after our first request.Now my thoughts on this movie is simply, AMAZING, GRACEFUL, AND BEAUTIFULLY EXPRESS. This is one of the best movies I've seen in a long time and I now understand why the manager at blockbuster didn't like it. I totally went over his HEAD. Its a great move that requires much attention. I really think this is a MUST SEE. I gather my own conclusion and feelings from the movie and I am sure other have too.

Trickle not treat,"Should any husband be allowed to direct his wife in love scenes? (Apart from home video/DVDs with their questionable production values. ) If he's not explicit enough people shout ""cheat!"" If he's too explicit then one questions his own limit setting. That I guess was one of the dilemmas (but not the least) facing Daniel Aronowsky with his filming of his wife Rachel Weisz in his new film THE FOUNTAIN.Daniel Aronowsky directs this multi leveled/ layered story of a tale of love and the quest for immortality through the ages; on a physical, scientific and spiritual level. It's set at the time of the conquistadors, the present day and in a timeless state. And if that sounds a little confusing, well that's because it is; until at least a good half hour into the film.One gets the feeling that the editing process must have been a ""sturm und drang"" performance, with time changes, scene changes, reversals in time sequences all taking part. And the script is not as tight as it could be despite multiple revisions greater than a south African history textbook. This film has been a labour of love for him, it having first being proposed and worked on since the late '90's. Initially the Hugh Jackman role was to be played by Brad Pitt who pulled out at the last minute, causing the whole project to collapse. Cate Blanchett also pulled out, causing him to re-cast his wife in her role. I guess he just wanted someone he'd be sure wouldn't abandon him in the end. It's like his own FITZCARRALDO (8/10) So, after all that, did I like the film? Some of the set pieces were really quite beautiful, given the relatively small budget. And Hugh Jackman gives a pleasantly overwrought performance. Rachel Weisz, A Rhodes? graduate isn't really all that interesting in this- back to the old problem of directing family. And I would have loved to have seen more of Stephen McHattie who played the Chief Inquisitor. But I guess that will come with the deleted scenes, extra length special edition. Back to the over editing/ strange cuts that occurred throughout.But overall, no. This isn't a film that is going to get me waiting fervently for the special edition DVD. . The film reminded me of SOLARIS(8/10) especially in the way it ambled through the space sequences in an almost zen-like trance. SOLARIS was also a film that initially didn't grab me by the short and curlies initially, but grew on me from a second viewing.While I can't say I was too excited about it in toto, this is a film which will have its proponents and fierce opponents.

I dutifully sat through the whole disaster and at the end was just as puzzled. I'm not surprised it bombed at the box-office as arty directors such as Aronovsky are only interested in showing off how clever they are rather than producing an engaging, entertaining film.All in all a complete waste of time and effort from all concerned.

Wonderously ponderous,"There is something strangely hypnotic and alluring about 'The Fountain'.The sets and photography are crafted to create this otherworldly feel and to take you through a narrative that shifts from the Spanish Inquisition to a Space Odyssey of the future.The script is ponderous and grand in its depiction, which it ultimately fails to reach. However, Rachel Weisz and Hugh Jackman are engaging and do very well with the understated emotions that are necessary in this delicate piece of film making.I appreciate this film for what it is, a look into the delicacy of life, love and death and if you can admire its audacity to venture into such territory and not be unsettled by its meanderings it will be a worthwhile experience, one that will oddly remain with you for sometimes.",6.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"

If only we had stopped ourselves early on when our doubts and disbelief began; but, I suppose we felt that there was a point to be made, a plot resolution to be arrived at, something worthwhile to be experienced. No; it was not to be. I could have better spent the time having my ear hairs plucked.

When the movie was over, no one in the entire audience moved for at least 30 seconds, the credits were rolling and we were all trying to decide if that really was the ending. I tried to get into it, I really did, but it's basically 3 scenes playing over and over and over again throughout the entire thing. You think you're seeing one thing at one point and then it immediately switches to another thing, and then to another, none of it made any sense.

Beautiful but complicated movie...  a mixed review,"I'll give a mixed review of the movie.Part of me was quite touched by the life-and-death-and-love aspect of the movie. As a romantic story it is one of the best I've ever seen. Both actors did an incredible job and Rachel Weisz certainly gives her role the very necessary emotional and human tone. Wolv... I mean Hugh Jackmann, at last seems to have a challenging role and comes out very well indeed. Very touching story and images.Another part of me felt the movie tried to spin way too much and at times seemed confusing. The future part seem way too much ""Buddhism"" and spirituality mixed with sci-fi images. It gets tiresome eventually. I was always thinking the could get on with the main story.The movie is no doubt visually stunning. Pity that the director didn't give the Conquistador part of the movie more screen-time.Its not an easy to movie to understand or appreciate. If you want an entertaining movie go watch something else.

Beautiful and enigmatic,"Darren Aronofsky is an unconventional film director whose work is always provocative but not invariably successful. By the time I got round to viewing his 2006 offering ""The Fountain"", I had viewed five of his movies. I was impressed in different ways by ""Requiem For A Dream"", ""The Wrestler"" and ""Black Swan"", less happy with ""Noah"", and put off by ""Pi"". ""The Fountain"" is definitely worth seeing - an innovative work which he wrote as well as directed.It tells three stories across vastly different time periods: a Spanish conquistador in a Mayan civilisation on a quest for his queen, a contemporary scientific researcher struggling to keep his wife alive: and a future space traveller in a bubble with a tree on the way to a dying star. The three tales are introduced briefly and enigmatically at the very beginning of the film and only as the work unfolds do the meanings and connections become apparent, strengthened by the repeated appearances of the same actors Hugh Jackman and Rachel Weisz.This is a philosophical work about love and loss and about mortality and immortality that is beautifully composed and shot with a limited budget eliminating the use of any CGI. It is not totally comprehensible but it is thought-provoking.",,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
The fountain as a whole,"""The Fountain"" was directed by the talented Darren Aronofosky who has had success in his other films such as ""Requiem for a Dream"" and ""The Wrestler"".

And I figured, this is a good approach at death: having to cope alone in the afterlife, along a Tree that represents the object of the search, remembering love as he felt it.

Beautiful Masterpieces just don't come by everyday,"Every year there's the more or less provocative and philosophical film, that naturally, because of its contents tends to provoke two completely different opinions. Either you firmly defend it and love it, or you hate it and attack it. There's no way of escaping this dichotomy for the simple reason that a movie like the Fountain is a movie that is character driven and their proof of love requires an elevate suspension of disbelief from the viewer. If you are not one of those, than don't even consider watching this movie, but if you are, if you let yourself be carried away buy the beauty of the images, the intensity of the characters and the devotion to one purpose, than you will most certainly enjoy and praise the Fountain as much as I did. Quite frankly I cannot imagine Brad Pitt or Cate Blanchett taking the place of Hugh Jackman and Rachel Weisz. They took the characters and made them their own. Although Weisz is extraordinary in Izzy's skin, is Jackman's take on Tommy that is the true engine of the movie. He composes three different characters in three different approaches but with the same love driven obsession. I myself reckon that at the beginning the movie does suffer not only from unmanaged pace but also from the viewer's eventual detachment from the story. But although the movie runs for 90 minutes it is more than enough to tell three different stories. I reckon that Fountain haters might criticize it for narrative confusion and some questions left unanswered or not explained, but that's not its purpose. We are meant to believe and connect with these two characters and their motives, strengths, weaknesses and actions. And we do. Thanks to Aronofsky, Weisz but most specially to Jackmans true masterpiece and Clint Mansell. The Foutntain would not have been the same without him: his soundtrack is a poem of love, tragedy, loss and beauty that very rarely has Hollywood presented us.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"

But there's something I didn't like. When I had first heard of this movie being in production I was immediately fascinated. I thought it would be something I guess, more simple. Such as they live in the past and find the fountain, drink from it and live for years. Only in the future she develops a brain tumor and the fountain can't save her that type of thing.

idea was good but Aronofsky tried too hard and so messed it up,I really liked his other two movies Pi and Requiem for a Dream. So I had high hopes. I understand that the concept of this one different compared to the other two. I think what happened was that he tried too hard and he lost his passionate creative spirit. I am hoping this is just temporary for this movie only. Symbols and transitions back are too obvious as opposed to Lynch for instance. It was like Aronofsky for dummies. It has the taste but not like the original taste if you will. I still have high hopes for this guy. Rachel Weisz was not acting well.

Worst Movie I Have EVER Seen-I'm dead serious!,"I saw this movie in an advance screening last night. I looked pretty cool, and lots of IMDb reviews had 10 stars. I enter the theater, and sit a couple seats down from the city's top movie critic.The first 10 minutes of the movie past, making no sense at all, and the sound was just too loud. So I thought, okay, maybe it'll get better in a second. 20 minutes pass, and this movie kept jumping from one year to the next, and back. I was SO confused I thought my head was going to explode. I whisper to the person next to me and asked, ""Do you get this?"" They say, ""No, not at all!"" The acting was just terrible, Hugh Jackman didn't fit the part, the picture was way too dark, but WAY too bright at points that the ENTIRE theater actually had to shield their eyes!

Speechless,"I had been reading reviews of the film for a few months prior to its release in the UK and was eagerly awaiting it. I must say i was not a fan of Aronofsky's 'Reqiem for a Dream'.

The film left me horrified.That aside 'The Fountain' promised some profound concepts that no doubt would apply to any philosophical mind. So finally the release date came and my partner and i managed to find one of the few cinemas in London that showed it on the opening weekend.I could never have expected such an experience. It was profoundly touching. Its content pressed on fundamentals into the mysteries of life that are simply so rare in modern film. As a result i considered it so great, magnificent, awesome, ecstatic, heart-breaking and mind-numbing all in one. It couldn't be more pertinent. The concepts of life and death in there most absolute form are so easily overlooked as we are consumed by the workings of our everyday mundane life. This film shows them plainly for all to see.My partner and i left the theatre without a word to each other. We actually didn't speak for the rest of the night. I never would have known that a film could reduce me to such base emptiness.We both spoke the following day about how we heard so many people in the cinema mention that they didn't understand the movie and by the way they were speaking one could tell they were unimpressed and belittled it.

He owes an apology to those who hold the opinion that life is meaningless and senseless. He didn't even make their argument. I was left wondering if the writer wrote this on a bad acid trip. To make any comparison of this tripe to Kubrick's 2001 is stretching the imagination beyond any conceivable breaking point.

Death: A Rebirth,"Familiar of course with Pi and Requiem For A Dream, I knew that when I saw The Fountain I would be taken aback by the inventiveness and talent in the film-making itself, and I was. It has very progressive and interesting cinematography, with lots of gold in the theme of the lighting, which movies rarely have and this happens to have in nearly every seen. The editing was, as in Requiem, intensely complex, infusing the sharp images of reality as we know it with abstract sequences involving the Tree of Life and the nebula that surrounds it. The musical score gives the film such drama and emotional drive, even if it's only a hint of the power that it had in Requiem. The story, however, could just be either something way ahead of its time or way ahead of itself.The Fountain is a movie that cannot explain itself, so it's created in a way relative to an impressionist painting. You'll find that you're asking yourself questions about the story, like stories by their very nature provoke you to do, but they tend to be qusetions that you feel you've either missed the answer to or don't quite understand the answer to. I'm not panning the film for its intricacy. It's very possible that it has a profound point at the doorstep of the answers to all of the questions you'll find yourself asking yourself about the story. And it does provoke thought. For instance, the tagline for the movie is, ""What if you could live forever?"" During it, you surprisingly end up seriously asking yourself that. What if you could? What would you do? But the film requires such concentration and patience and the subsequent pondering after seeing it, and after several ""avant-garde"" and ""post-modernist"" and ""neo-realist"" filmmakers have opened so many brain-rattling discussions over so many films that they strategically claim later to have meant basically nothing so that they could look down on their audience as patsies, the victims of their time and age, I grow suspicious when a film is so cryptic that by the end, the plot hasn't even entirely revealed itself at face value yet.As for Hugh Jackman and Rachel Weisz, the two leads that replaced Brad Pitt and Jennifer Connelly, are very impressive, Jackman being one of the great cryers of recent cinema and Weisz being so evasively good at absorbing your sympathy.

I will say that it does take some knowledge of Zen to fully appreciate the movie. If you are reading this and have not seen the movie, but are planning on seeing it, I will just give you a hint and say that Jackman's character is not traveling through time. Everything that happens is within himself. It may make it easier to understand, because before I first saw this movie, I saw the trailer, and it confused many people, including myself because it made it seem like Jackman and Weisz were traveling through time and space.

The search for eternal life,"""The Fountain"" is a different film. The visual effects, the poetic style, the mythology and the non-linearity of the plot give it a unique style and form, different from everything else! The movie is not easy to understand, because it's all around a metaphysical and philosophical subject: the rebirth after death and the possibility of an eternal life but in the end its greatest value is to present the viewer a beautiful and poetic love story with great visual effects. In fact, visually, the film is very good, in spite of having some ""cliché ideas"" about what could be an eventual life after death, and the ancestral idea of the Human soul floating in the Universe However, I liked the insertion of the Mayan mythology in the movie.

It probably started with Brad saying, ""Hey Darren I have some creative differences."" And Aronofsky said, ""Really? What are they Brad?"" And Brad finished with, ""This movie makes no sense and is going to be the black hole that sucks my career down into the toilet, I quit."" And WB should have taken that as a clue and just left the project axed, but unfortunately they didn't and this crap-fest was unleashed on the public.If anyone reads this who hasn't seen it yet and still wants to then maybe it will make more sense if you drink a bunch of cough syrup beforehand, otherwise you might as well take the 8 dollars and just throw it in the sewer and save yourself the 2 hours to do something else.",1.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
Intellectually Awesome,"The Fountain is one of those movies that takes one out of the time and space that they exist in today. It is not for the average viewer who just wants some evening entertainment. It reaches into your being and makes you think about life, the continuum of life after death, the universal life, what we are, what we may be, how we are all tied together in this plane of existence.If you've ever had a transcendental experience, you will relate to this movie. I believe only a few of us are truly capable of understanding the overriding theme, and thus wonder if many will not like it. I however found it fascinating, the acting was superb by both Hugh Jackman, and Rachel Weisz, and their supporting cast. Well done special effects makes the transformations of the three stories come alive.It's a story bigger than love, it a story of existence and interconnectivity of all things past and future.

Broken Fountain,"I was so surprised to sign on IMDb and see all of these rave reviews about this movie. This movie seemed like an overkill love story on acid. The thing that bothered me was the repetitiveness and the disjointed story. The acting is great and the visuals are spectacular but the story felt like the same thing over and over for an hour and a half. I'll give this a shot on DVD since so many seem to love it but in all honesty I have to say that this is one of the few movies that I came very close to walking out on and I've only done that about 3 times in my life. So, while I see the great things in this film such as the acting and visuals I just can't get past the horribly drawn out story that in the end left me unfulfilled and confused.If you are looking for a deep and convoluted movie of romance with just a touch of action then you should check this out.

A Meditation on Life and Death,"This was an amazing film! The visuals were absolutely stunning, hearkening back to the past through the use of non-digital imagery and sets/matte paintings while standing as an evolutionary move in the stagnancy of current cinema. The storyline was heartfelt and compelling, despite its non-linearity. The masterfully constructed alternating timelines/realties help drive the themes of life, love, salvation, and death while never resorting to overt or explicit means of delivering these ideas. The overall feel of the film is intense, driving, tragic, and heartshakingly sad, but all the while somehow maintains its own sense of hope and ""awe."" I'm not even sure what genre to classify this film under. Many would call it science fiction, and I would somewhat agree. But its also a romance, a period drama, a modern medical thriller?

Why do you think The Fountain is good?,"When I saw the preview for The Fountain, I swore to myself I'd never watch it. Of course, it was then assigned for one of my classes and I had to go.The preview was misleading and makes it look like the bastard child of the Highlander and Sweet November. The Fountain is still a lousy movie, but for different reasons.Before everyone flames me and accuses me of being a troll or an orc or a level-nine hobbit-smashing ice mage, I will say the movie had a great score and was pretty to look at (the effects are even better when you learn the space scenes weren't done with CGI but instead was footage of highly magnified liquids in motion), and the acting was solid.Now my problems (possible spoilers): It's only 90 minutes and it DRAGS. On and on and on...I can't see Hugh Jackman in the lotus position without laughing.The movie has a hairless bubble-astronaut doing Tai Chi in his pajamas as he drifts through space...and it wasn't billed as a comedy.Aronofsky took 90 minutes to say 'death is OK' and 'don't ignore your loved ones when they're dying.' (There's some debate among the movie's fans where people are unsure if the space scenes really happened or if Tommy imagined them. I hope to God he imagined it all because if it really took him 600 years to learn crap we all knew before we entered the theater then there's no way in hell he's smart enough to stop aging and cure brain tumors.)",,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"

What was the motto? All the doors are closed, so just live it, do not push? There is no challenge respecting the story but very challenging in the way it is shot.

My favorite movie of all time.,"First off, that the first time I saw this, I was slightly disappointed, since I expected something more similar to Aronofsky's first two movies - ""Requiem for a Dream"" and ""Pi"". Something raw, something brutal, something in-your-face.The Fountain is more complicated though. After seeing it for the first time, the music and the visuals never completely left me, and i kept watching it. Again and again. By now i saw this movie more often than any other (ten times so far), and it still does not bore me. In fact, I keep discovering new stuff every single time i see it.This is one of these rare works of art where every scene, every dialog, every tiny detail in the background, every note in the score, is of importance for the grand overall picture - and what a picture it is indeed!Life, death, love. The cornerstones that define the human conditions, are what this movie is ultimately about. Most that would have tried to get across the point that ""The Fountain"" makes would have failed, but not Aronofsky - he delivers it with unmatched visual perfection, and with the help of outstanding acting from his cast.No movie ever matched the score and the visuals so well. The music is beautiful and haunting at times, and keeps building up momentum, just like the movie does, towards the biggest, most emotional and deepest climax I ever saw in any movie. Be sure to turn the volume up for this one!An extremely powerful movie, and very thought-provoking at that.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"

This film carries with it the great questions of life...where do we come from and to where is life taking us....In ' the fountain ' we are heading for a bright and wonderful future.as said before : a great symbiosis between film and music.highly entertaining !",7.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
This makes me wonder if anyone can make good surrealist fiction . . .,"Before you assume I'm one of the countless people who didn't get the plot, thus doesn't like this movie, think again. I understood everything about The Fountain from open to close. Being someone who honestly used to enjoy good surrealist fiction, I hoped this may have been at least worth a watch. And maybe it was. However, the main problem isn't that the movie was too confusing, but rather that it was too elementary.It's almost an unspoken rule among bad surrealist authors and screenwriters: ""If I'm too unintelligent to think of anything but a traditional, clichéd plot, then I have to awe the viewer into thinking I've done something so utterly original and intelligent they don't even realize I just picked up some children's book off my bookshelf and copied it word-for-word."" Darren Aronofsky knows that rule, and he follows it here. It fooled a lot of viewers, but it didn't fool me.The surrealist elements of The Fountain deal with the (presumed) spiritual world of the Garden of Eden. The main character, who is presented as your standard male hero, tries to save his dying wife by finding the Fountain of Youth, aka the Tree of Life in this spiritual world by finding a way to reverse aging in the physical world through medicine. That's the basic synopsis you get from the first fifteen minutes, and that plot takes you up to the last twenty minutes when the results of all this come into place. Without spoiling anything, the ending is traditional and expected, butback to that ruleis laced with some of the most over-the-top surrealist imagery ever put on screen. If you see past the intense flashes of gold light, you'll realize the ending was completely dull and unoriginal. And so was the rest of the movie.So . . .This is the point when it gets hard for me to write a review. Put simply, The Fountain isn't likely going to be in the top 10 worst movie list you've ever seen, but that doesn't mean it isn't bad. Like the rule states, it bashes you over the head with some very pretty environments and some truly emotional-grabbing scenes in order to create a faux sense of awe . . . then nothing. It's like going to a concert and the stage lights are going crazy and the band is tearing up the stage with more energy than anything you've ever seen and the lead singer tells you the meaning to one of their most powerful songs and it hits you hard . . . but they don't sing.Put another way: The Fountain is literally nothing but a small love story with a semi-cliché ending. All the surrealist aspects are throw-away when it comes to the actual plot. They're just a hook. If that's what you enjoy, traditional love stories, then this movie is for you. But if you came here for a deep, intelligent movie, then you're going to be disappointed like I was. I guess I'm trying to instruct you to watch it with low expectations.Other minor complaints/complements: The surrealist aspects really got so over-the-top they were borderline cheesy in more than one part of the movie. They also needed to be shortened by a lot, because they took away from the shallow plotwhich was the director's intention. On the other hand, the casting was very well selected and the acting was solid.The director avoided a lot of obvious things he could have done to cheese this movie up considerablysuch as add pointless nudity or a longer run-timeand that is something else I give him credit for.Overall, worth a watch. Once. You may like it or you may not. It is not the intelligent, original movie that the trailer advertises it is. If anything, it's pretty typical.4/10",4.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
An incredible movie filled with meaning and wonder! Next?,"I have been anxiously looking forward to this movie from the time it was originally announced approximately five years ago. I was totally engrossed by 'Pi,' and became a certified Aronofsky fan when 'Requim For A Dream' came out on DVD (it never appeared in any local theaters and Lancaster is not exactly a small town. There are about 28-30 screens in Lancaster.). with 'The Fountain' finally being released on DVD I was just hoping that my expectations weren't so high that almost anything was going to be disappointing. I am glad to report that the movie was all I had hoped for and then some. As I write this I find myself still sifting through various parts of the movie in my mind and plan on watching it a second time tonight, hopefully being able to clear up a few things that I'm still a bit unsure of.What really amazes me however is the group of people who try to rip it down as nothing more than ""mind candy."" If you don't like the movie that is okay, but I do have a problem with people who insist that it is junk and that nobody should enjoy it. The suggestions that Aronofsky was trying to make a movie that was mind bending to the point of being nonsensical is absolute rubbish. I think Aronofsky made a movie with a great deal of thought in regard to very big and complex themes. My own very quick interpretation of this great film goes likes this. I believe that the parts that took place in the 1500's are not real but come from Izzi's unfinished book, and since Izzi wrote it, the parts of Tomas and the Queen are based on Tom and Izzi of the present. When she show's Tom the Nebula and the story of the death of a star and the rebirth, she is at that point telling Tom, without telling Tom, how to finish the book. And she is also telling Tom that she is now unafraid of death because she is confident that life is truly eternal. She even tells Tom that she will always be with him, but that it is up to Tom to be able to come to that understanding on his own. The part that takes place in the future is Aronofsky's way of telling this to the viewer. Whether the portion of the film that takes place in the future is real or imagined is up to the viewer. Either way it still delivers the same message. At it's very depth I believe Aronofsky's tale is one that every human wrestles with. Death! Is death final, or does the soul/spirit continue to exist. I believe that is the overriding theme of the film and it is up to each individual to interpret it as they see fit.The metaphors in the movie are many and far reaching. The role of the inquisitor. The meaning of the ring. The tree of life itself and how it is used in the future to sustain him and in the present as a potential cure. The hairs that are raised when he reaches his fingers out towards the tree itself and the hairs on Izzi's neck. The movie is almost intoxicating in it's own way.My question for fans of the movie is this. Other than what is all ready scheduled what book or author would you most like to see Aronofsky take on in the future. I would love to see him work with fellow Brooklynite, author Paul Auster. Some of Don Delilo's early work would translate well to the screen with the right director(guess who I have in mind). I think his visual interpretation of anything by Albert Camus would be well worth the effort. For a dark comic twist I would enjoy seeing him work with a Thomas Berger novel. Thomas Pynchon and Aronofsky would be interesting. In the end his ideas are so original he probably doesn't need the help, but I still find it interesting to contemplate. An Aynn Rand book could be interesting (although as I grow older I find Rand to be less and less relevant). One last idea would what he would do with Gabriel Garcia-Marquez's great book 'One Hundred Years of Solitude.' This has run on far too much all ready, but I would really like to hear what you would like to see him do in the future? Thanks.",8.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
"Visually astounding, but far too flawed to be looked at as anything more","After seeing the brilliance he delivered in Requiem for a Dream last summer, I was up for anything Darren Aronofsky had to offer. I never had a chance to view his first film, Pi, but I did want to make a point of seeing The Fountain as soon as I could. And despite the heavily negative reviews I read, I figured it had to be somewhat worthwhile.So as anyone who has read anything on this film can tell you, The Fountain cycles through a thousand year cycle of a man named Tom (Hugh Jackman), and the love of his life, Isabel (Rachel Weisz), and his search for everlasting life. In 1500, he is a Spanish conquistador, searching for a tree that will keep his queen alive forever. In 2000, he is a lab scientist trying to find a cure for his ailing wife. In 2500, he is a cosmonaut, traveling through space with a tree, haunted by old memories.While the film is undeniably unique and original, it often played itself out to look like a movie that was originally envisioned to be so much grander. It really does feel like Aronofsky made a compromise and took out the real lavishness of the film, and just left the bare bones. Not that the powerful and deep seated core of the movie is not there, it just feels like that is it, and nothing more.While this would not usually sound like a bad thing, it proves to be one here. Whole sequences go on for minutes at a time, and they just point to something that is either not there, or not worthy of retrieving. Every moment in the film is interconnected (hence why some are overplayed quite annoyingly), but every moment does not feel like it is needed. It just turns boring really quickly, and leads to a lot of eye-rolling as the movie barrels on. And for a movie that is just over ninety minutes, that just does not work. While editing probably would not have solved this, more coherency in these redundant sequences probably would have helped.And while the film is fairly easy to follow at first (despite the jumpiness between time periods and its numerous allusions to everything from the bible to medieval times), it completely turns itself on its own head during its denouement. I expected my mind to get screwed with, but it just did not seem to make a whole total whack of sense the way Aronofsky did it. It seemed more like he wanted to play out every idea he has, and just throw it at the audience all at once and yell ""Gotcha!"" My mind hurts even now, just attempting to comprehend the ultimate point of The Fountain. Was it all an exercise to toy with me, or did Aronofsky genuinely believe he delivered the film he set out to originally? If the whole film did anything for me, it is the fact that I am now curious to see what the original vision was, and if it was just as buggy as this one.What the film also loses in a lot of cases is emotion from the cast. The entire supporting cast looks like they are either watching a train wreck or just seem completely confused at why they are even there throughout the entirety of the film. None of them are particularly notable, and most are seen for fleeting minutes, if at all (and the majority are only used in the events that take place in 2000).Jackman seems like he is really trying, but only makes it work half the time. You can see the pain in his face and in his actions, but when brilliant ideas that make the film progress occur, he just does not seem too phased by what has hit him. He looks just like the script reader told him that something big just happened, and he just runs along and goes with the flow. He is lifeless for the majority of the film, and when his poignant moments come, you stare in agony just wishing that he was not so stiff delivering it. Weisz fares even worse. Despite being the key to the entire production, she goes totally underused. I never got a real sense of why Jackman was moved to keep her alive in any of the scenarios, and got even less a sense as to what she brought to the film besides being the reason for the search. She is good for what she does, but her character does not feel complete. I can only hope this too, was something that got cut.The film succeeds however, in astonishingly detailed style, in its set design and visual effects. They are just totally awe-inspiring, and so totally unique. It is quite the trip, and it never lets up in any case. The colours used are just totally out of this world. Every single visual spec is more than a treat for the audience. It guides them through this totally flawed movie, and is visually appetizing. If I continued watching for any reason (or recommended this to anyone), it was because of just how much effort was obviously used in bringing Aronofsky's vision to life. He clearly is very vivid and imaginative, and his film benefits as a result. It all feels so fluid and so real, even at its most overt-the-top moments. It really breathes life into how biblically and epically laden the film is, and suggests just how much greater it could have been if it was shown in its originally conceived form.Although it is heavily flawed, The Fountain works as a beautiful case of visual direction. Aronofsky clearly was far too ambitious with this third project of his. If he dug a little deeper into his original screenplay, I think he could have made this compromise a whole lot more watchable than it is.6.5/10.",6.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
"Exhausting, terrible movie. Not deep - just dumb.","From what I could gather, everyone in the theater, including myself hated this movie. Very boring. Extremely repetitive - some scenes are repeated over and over so many times I gave up counting. Constant flashbacks (seemingly every 30 seconds). SUPER close-up shots thru most of the flick. Drab, dull and dark. Endless tears,tears and more tears. Way too much for any one movie. Everyone I've spoken to says this is the dumbest or worst movie they've seen. The director neglects the fact that an audience needs to feel a connection for a romance to work on screen. Shedding tears only works if the viewer cares about the character and their plight. Flashbacks only work if the story line is and remains established, and should be limited. If boring films were illegal, the producers of this gem would be behind bars. Some reviewers try to play this off as ""deep"", ""sensitive"" and ""spiritual"". No. It's just dumb.",1.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
"Elaborate, profound and sincere","The harsh critics made at this movies are, in a way, understandable. There is a French adjective that might sum up the opinion of those who did hate it: ""pompier"", which could be roughly translated by ""pompous"" : a generic, bombastic subject rendered in a academic and pretentious fashion.Its highly sophisticated visuals and non-linear structure makes it particularly challenging, indeed. Furthermore, dealing as it does with as universal themes as Death, Eternal love or the search for immortality makes it daring, a word that could also mean ""risky"".When a movie challenges what we, mere moviegoers, expect from them in general (a clear structure and the feeling that we have understood all of it when leaving the theater) the risk for its authors is never far.I for one see it as a daring and beautiful work. And, dear me, a profound and moving narration. To make matters worse, the acting from Hugh Jackman, in his quest through Time, is really impressive.But then again, is the movie too ambitious? Did Aronofsky foolishly tried to make a timeless movie? Is Mansell's score, dramatically departing from his previous works with Aronofsky (Pi, Requiem For A dream), equally overly vapid and grandiose? I reckon these are the sorts of critics that could easily be made but I do not share them and would find them more appropriate concerning Kubrick's 2001 (another ambitious Sci-Fi epic aiming at universal themes) which I found cold and distant.In my humble opinion, Darren Aronofsky, as an auteur (unlike Requiem For A Dream, this is an original screenplay), completely ignored formulaic structures for a (daring/risky) story with universal themes. And giving the main role to his wife proves is eagerness to illustrate first and foremost a love story in a non-conventional way and how sincere he was in this bold enterprise.

A movie to be felt,"Most people I know would HATE this movie, and I that's understandable. (Classic comment at the end of it from a fellow film-goer: 'What the f*ck did the dude in the ball have to do with it?') It is slow paced, arty, self-indulgent, and if watched with a mind for plot and coherency, ultimately frustrating. It is a hard and demanding film, and I don't think it can be enjoyed in any sort of normal conscious terms. As the filmmaker has stated, Requiem for a Dream this is not. I don't think its a film to be necessarily understood, just experienced. It plays like a dream, repeating motifs and themes in vastly different contexts, connecting them by way of suggestion and symbols rather than an ordered narrative. It is, above all else, a movie about accepting death, that death is part of the key to eternal life, and therefore a mystery and a paradox which we cannot understand by applying conscious human tools of perception. And this is why people will hate this movie. Its answer, its heart, is impenetrable by the conscious mind. Walking out is like waking from a dream, or coming down from an hour and a half nitrous oxide high where something in you knows you have seen a truth, there is a feeling of some kind of vague understanding, but you could not express it in the words we have to use. It is the same way one might feel after meditating on the meaning of life - you reach a point where you have to accept the mystery of it all. And that is frustrating. Unless you can just accept it. To just let the images, the hints, the paradoxes, go into you and to feel them. I know why people compare this to 2001 - I certainly couldn't say what 2001 is about - but I damn sure have a feeling.

"Pretentious, not entertaining, no story, wooden characters","This movie contained three parallel stories, or, really, two and a half, squeezed into barely 90 minutes, despite the fact that each one moved very, very slowly. So, none of these three stories were at all well-developed, and all of them were very boring. And none of the characters were well-developed enough for me to care about any of them. So there really wasn't much of any interest here to me.This movie was kind of full of itself and its symbolism and its unusual and artsy parallel story structure which, I suppose, are supposed to make it seem like it's unique and ""deep"" to people who are into movies with unusual plot structures and allegedly profound life lessons.In sum, it felt like pretentious artsy pseudo-philosophical BS that was not remotely entertaining, but was very boring.And besides that, Hugh Jackman's over-dramatic histrionics are hard to watch, at least to me. Yikes.I enjoyed Aronofsky's last film Requiem for a Dream, despite the fact that it too was full of life lessons, but after seeing The Fountain, well, I will be thinking more than twice before I see another film by Aronofsky. He seems like a young arrogant director who is full of himself and self-indulgent but who is not really all that interested in entertaining an audience and is more interested in teaching an audience about his vast wisdom.There's a lot of excessively glowing positive reviews about this stinker here at IMDb, so, just so you don't think I'm bonkers, you can get some more bad reviews, readily accessible to everyone, for free, on the web, in USA Today, Philadelphia Inquirer, Atlanta Journal-Constitution, Christian Science Monitor, San Francisco Chronicle, and Los Angeles Times, to name a few.You'd be better off using the time to see some other movie that is actually entertaining to watch and not so full of pretentious BS.",2.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"

The other issue is that in some of the scenes they whisper so quietly you can't hear a word that's said. The story and the ideas put into this movie are really fantastic though. You will have to pay attention and definitely turn the volume up when they whisper, which is quite often. Also realize the narrative isn't complete and much of it is left to your own interpretation.

wanted my money back!,"This was not the movie that the trailer lead me to believe that it was. It was 'artsy' and not a love story the way I would have imagined it to be (and hoped it to be). I sat through the whole movie thinking ""I sure wish I hadn't wasted my money on this"".There was a film festival type short film here that was dragged out by repetitive (boring) scenes in order to lengthen it for the regular cinema. For example, Hugh's only 'happy' memory was the same vision of his dying wife running (I assume) through a part of their house laughing. This memory replay was vague at best and played like it was the only reason for his desire to blow off what little time he had left with his wife and to yell at her constantly even in the bubble. Personally, when I have happy thoughts about those that I love, I have many to choose from. This part seemed an extremely lame attempt of portrayal of 'happy memories' that were driving him mentally and physically.But even that was not the worst of the movie. The worst was the future bubble in the nebula where Hugh became bald bubble boy. Oh my how that sucked the life out of the plot. It was by far the worst of the worst. Eating the 'hairy' tree (of life?) and Hugh 'inking' himself to death. Bald is beautiful they say; but what was it with the bald Hugh in the bubble? Making him a bald, tree eating, ink inflicting bubble boy floating around in a dead star nebula was just ridiculous; kind of like nails on a chalk board annoying artsy stuff. And where was the fountain that the movie was named for? In fact there was no fountain but just two trees. In the end, the tree did not extend his life but devoured it and turned him into a plot of flowers next to the tree (becareful what you wish for?).I admit, I'm not a big fan of the ""I'm doing this but it means that"" type of art form. Whether it's on a canvas or on film, it is not my preference in entertainment. And all of these people commenting on how great the film is based on those factors...well, I can't relate because to me it was a great story idea ruined by the director's need to impose the 'figure out what I'm trying to say' film making technique rather than something that should have been finite and not open to so much interpretation and debate by the viewers. I'm not saying that I don't like a good 'figure it out as you go' movie, but something that has some real substance to it rather than so much vagueness and need to repeat scenes so often to fill up the empty space of the plot.It's too bad too, because there were stars in this movie that I've enjoyed watching in the past, but this was not their magnum opus by any stretch of the imagination. The director went out of his way to make Hugh as ugly as he could; not only physically, but as a shallow person.I can see this movie being redone with all of that in mind and make a true work of art in cinema by taking away the emptiness of this movie and filling it up with plot and acting that leaves you fulfilled instead of being left wanting for an actual story with some meat to it. This film should have stayed with film festivals instead of big screen cinema. There was just too much of the movie that didn't make any sense because it was played too much as 'artsy' instead of structured to deliver a real story line complete from beginning to end.But having said that; if you like the artsy, it doesn't make sense movies, than this one will be a winner for you. Based on the comments here, there are a lot of folks who like this kind of stuff and I don't begrudge them that. But in all fairness, I do prefer movie trailers to give more accurate accounting of what I'm paying to see and this was not the story I had expected. Like I said, it should have stayed on the art festival level and not at my local movie theatre.For me, I will be careful NOT to see anymore movies done by this particular director because he clearly has a style that I don't enjoy.",1.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
Quest for acceptance,"Watching this film was like watching a masterpiece painting coming to life. Visually it reminded me a lot of Anton Corbijn's video-clip of R.E.M.'s song ""Losing My Religion"", but then with the captivating music of the Kronos Quartet 20 times longer, who by the way did such a good job in the ""Requiem for a Dream""-film from the same director, who made this very picture; Darren Aronofsky.I read that Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett were cast for the lead characters, but Brad went for Troy (big mistake). I do not know if these two could have done a better job then Hugh Jackman and Rachel Weisz, but actually I think the rolls would have fitted better with Latino actors to be honest. I think it is a missed opportunity there for Penelope Cruz or Salma Hayek and Antonio Banderas or some other Latino, who could have maybe given this film that extra star it needed to make it truly legendary.But I am nitpicking this film to much. This film is a story of a man who cannot accept his wife is dying. His wife has already accepted her faith and has to painfully watch her husband struggle with this. This beautiful story is not about Tom trying to help Izzy by finding the cure for cancer, but exactly the opposite; the dying Izzy helping out Tom finding reconciliation with his ordeal of losing her. A wonderful film full of symbolism you can watch over and over again. 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
Death Is The Road To Awe,"Life, death, love, loss, desire, obsession, mortality, eternity, spirituality & duality, all come together in this sci-fi saga that chronicles the quest of one man's thousand years struggle to save the very woman he loves.

A little overcooked,"Hugh Jackman, bald. That's where we start this film. The question behind the movie is ""What if the Fountain of Life really existed?"" Of course, this film is primarily an exercise in visual excess and melodrama, much like Aronovsky's previous film, Requiem for a Dream. Much like that past film, this one places the story in the heart of emotion, concerning itself less with good storytelling and character development and more with creating situations of great emotion. But unlike Requiem, The Fountain's structure inhibits a full appreciation of the characters' emotional progression.While the film is visually brilliant, the pacing and the shallowness of the story often makes the progression of the film tedious and the inclusion of some of the religious visual motifs (and the picture of the future) really serve to distract from central point--a man's dealing with inevitable grief, which in its moments is quite impressive to watch. It's just burdened with a whole lot of extra ""stuff"" that's unnecessary to the core story, especially the overuse of the ""future story"". If the film were centered in the ""near future"" with occasional allusions to the fictional past, that might be sufficient dressing for the core element.As it stands, it's a passable affair, with good-enough acting, outstanding visuals and a few moments of melodrama that might move you, but it becomes difficult to watch because of the unfocused meandering of the sequences and some amount of zaniness, which detracts from the otherwise somber tone of the film (I have to liken it to how I felt about Superman Returns). There are good ideas here, but the end package doesn't match up with the potential. Better luck next time, Mr. Aronovsky. 6/10.",6.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"

Bold try... but ultimately rubbish. A tedious hash of a whinger with OCD,"I hesitate to criticise someone else's spiritual beliefs--- but I get the feeling that this movie was not about spiritual beliefs so much as crazed attachment. The hero can't let go of his wife. Does that echo the romantic attempts and psychological profiles of the director or the writer? Dunno. But the sentiment is very Rob McCuen, Leonard Nimoy-ish, for those of you who may have come across those two writers' attempts at love poetry and such in the late 1960s (Nimoy, famous as Spock in Star Trek, also wrote a very gooey romance novel). Maudlin to the point of mawkish.Just so you're clear, I LIKE metaphysical movies. And I like boldness in movie making. For that, the director gets kudos. But the pay-off was really bad. The hero displayed a narcissistic OCD that was meant to be endearing and inspiring and loving--- but just came off as creepy, indulgent, and well--- just plain crazy. As a result, most of his histrionics were annoying, rather than moving. He was, by turns, always shouting, throwing things, slamming things, or crying.But Hey--- what about that Rachel Weisz? is she HOT or what? The movie is almost worth the time just to see her for a couple of hours. But even so, better just go and rent 'The Mummy' and be satisfied with that.If you're a seeker--- well, you won't find it here. If you're a romance fancier--- same deal--- nothing here. The FX were nice, and the monkey had character, but that's about it. Save your time and your dough, and do something else. I gave this a 6 out of 10 because of Rachel, the FX, and the monkey, and at least the movie tried. Otherwise, to have been unnecessarily cruel, it was more of a 3.",6.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
Awesome film,"Two lovers collaborate on a mythical sci-fi romance novel that projects them 400 years into the past, and 600 years into the future. Each period (past, present, future) is an exquisite allegorical variation on the theme of death as creation, each expressed as a love story between Thomas and Isabel Creo.This film is full of imagery, symmetry, symbolism, and metaphor - especially in the future. This is a good film to make you feel the awe of nature and life on the grandest of scales from a perspective that is otherwise difficult to accept in part due to our attachment to ourselves and others.The DVD jacket blur is misleading and causes some to be confused.

Wild fantasy,"An unusual story that jumps chronologically back and forth, I kind of lost interest then slowly the fantasy pulled me back. It's heart this is a great love story but it's soul is a metaphysical journey to the edges of time and space. Rachael is awesome, there is something seductive about her screen presence, you want to help her. Hugh is also good in this, although there had to be at least one macho scene to keep the box office ticking.The production has a retro feel, like there is a filter across the lens.

"Stylish, Emotional and Unusual ...","This movie was pretty different from most I've seen - but in a really good kind of way. It was emotional, visually impressive and presented in a very unique manner. It was kind of a work of art.The story is about a medical doctor/researcher whose wife is dying of a tumor. He is desperately working on finding a cure, when something else is discovered ... and the story progresses from there.Given the setup, the movie has an emotionally intense / serious tone. It is presented from three different vantage points: the core plot, a visualization of what's going on in the doctor's mind, and a visualization of a book the doctor's wife is writing.The visualizations in this movie are pretty stunning. When combined with the classical-type music the combined effect is very poetic. I will probably remember some of the haunting visuals for a long time.If you're looking for a good, serious and meditative fantasy/sci-fi movie - here it is.

the road to awe?  **may contain spoilers**,"I really wanted to like this movie because the trailer made it seem really interesting--but it wasn't.

I love different movies, for example Donnie Darko and Memento, and I don't need elements of a film spoon-fed to me. But there was a lot of substance missing from certain elements.

"A Wonderful, Original, and Imaginative Film","This was probably the best film I saw in the year 2006. Everything about it was amazing; the music, the acting, the cinematography, the symbolism, the entire plot structure. That being said, the structure of it is kind of confusing if you aren't paying close attention to what's going on. You REALLY have to be watching for details and keep an open mind when you're seeing it to figure out what each of the little sub-plots mean and how they're all connected. However, if you understand what's going on, you're in for a hell of a good flick. So, if you're looking for a great film that makes more sense chronologically than Donnie Darko but less than the Terminator series, The Fountain is the one for you. While it may not be as action packed or high paced as some other films around (which isn't to say there's no action, since there are some very brutal scenes), The Fountain's plot is the most mature and intelligent around. Just don't go to the bathroom without pausing it first, or you'll probably miss something.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
A strong story not told overly well,"It's a damn shame that Darren Aronofsky was forced to cut his budget in half, because I would have loved to see what he could have come up with the original script. Because right now the film feels like it's halfway done. Like certain scenes are missing and that the film didn't reach its full potential.Right now the film is very much love it or hate it. Those film goers, who love deep and thought-provoking films will appreciate the underlying themes and the quiet atmosphere that slowly builds as the story progresses. Others, myself included, will see the fact that the film is not executed correctly. The overall story is a masterpiece, retelling the story of the first man and woman, but unfortunately that said story is not told correctly. The choice to separate the story into three different time periods and locations was a good one, but those three separate stories have to tie together in some way. And the first two time periods actually do feed of each other and they feel connected. But the last time period is there mainly for the gorgeous space imagery and for the trailer shots. Or at least that's the feeling I was left with after I was done watching this movie. There are some minor scenes where the third time period ties together with the first two, but they are few and far between.Thought I must admit that the first two stories are extremely well-done. The love story between these two archetypical characters is believable and eventually even a bit heart-breaking. Both main actors are very talented and they have a genuine chemistry. The cinematography IS damn impressive, special effects are used skillfully and this movie honestly managed to pull me in.Thus, in the end, this movie has an amazing story, but it doesn't manage to convey that story overly well. It's a brilliant movie for those that can appreciate it from a thematic, aesthetic or atmospheric point of view, but it's definitely not for those who demand a coherent, well-told story above all else.",6.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"

Underrated masterpiece,"A beautifully-told tragedy with a modern twist. Truly among Aronofsky's best, it intertwines a love story with mythology and concepts of life and death. It definitely takes more than one viewing of this film to really appreciate every nuance, but that's one of the reasons that this film is brilliant - you can notice something new every time you watch it. It is such a shame that the director's original vision couldn't be accomplished, but with what resources he had, he has made something incredible in ""The Fountain"". It's the kind of film which will make it's audience wonder about not only one's own mortality, but the ability, or lack thereof, to deal with a dying loved one and the prospect of an afterlife. These often touching and self-questioning themes coupled with breathtaking visual effects created with natural micro-photography, as well as the emotionally-enthralling score produced by Clint Mansell and Co. leave all of the viewer's senses seduced. Throw in a tragic love story delivered by some of Hollywood's finest talent and you have yourself a very intelligent piece of art with multiple layers, which is not to be brushed aside as ""pretensious"" or ""outlandish"". I ask the critics to watch again and think about these themes some more before judging this piece.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
"Death is inevitable,it is not a disease that can be cured.......","Three parallel stories revolves around the two characters in different time periods but there are invisible threads connecting this three stories.Each story is the journey of a man to save his beloved one from the certain death.A doctor trying to find the cure for his wife dying from cancer,a warrior in the ancient Spain to save his queen trying to find a tree which according to ancient Mayan myth is the source for life in Earth,and the third story is of a man traveling in the space to save the dying tree.First story which is the real story and other two stories are used as symbolism and interpretations to make us realize the message and to express the purpose of the movie.The plot of the movie looks very simple on the surface,Darren Aronofsky use the ancient myths and mysteries of universe as the symbolism to raise the questions on life and death.The Fountain is the movie which does not depend on it's story but on what will we experience after watching the movie,you cannot know what movie delivers by just reading it's story on the page you have to experience the movie on your own. What i felt about the movie is that this is a great effort but it lacks in vision and focus.Due to it's lack of clear insight the movie failed to get us to the destined point and the message of the movie get lost and remained unclear and at the end i was left unsatisfied.The Fountain is not like other Hollywood mainstream sci-fi cinema,this movie reminds me of the Andrew Tarnofynsky's movies,The Solyaris and The Stalker which deals with the same questions and philosophy of human life,it's existence and it's purpose through symbolism.But this movie is not as complete and insightful as those movies but still a good experience to watch.The best thing about the movie is it's beautiful cinematography,it's editing and its mesmerizing music given by Clint Massel.This three things makes the movie a visually captivating and eye-pleasing experience to watch but it failed to be eye-opening experience for me.The movie have outstanding performance of Rachelz Weisz but Hugh Jackman could have done much better job here,i think he was not the right choice for the role.Darren Aronofsky is a very talented director with a great vision,his every work took out some deep thoughts from inside of us forces us to face the harsh reality of human life,the sorrow,the failure,the death.His works always remains like a very sad poem with a message.The Fountain is so far the worst movie from him but still have strength to distinct itself from other movies we see nowadays,you can see the fingerprints of a brilliant and visionary artist in his bad movie too.",7.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"

Bring It On Home,"""Zardoz anyone?"" Sounds more like the stuff of keyboard vengeance that an honest review. I'll go ahead and take a step past the 2-cent quip. Is this film easy to understand? No. Is it easy to plot? No. Is a film of this individuality made often? No. Was I caught with a senior citizen's ticket by an usher? Yes. There have been others in cinematic history whose strangeness surpasses conventional standards and commands us to either accept its difference as enlightenment or refuse it as pretentious hogwash. 2001 has been mentioned so far in comparison but I might offer a more recent film like Terry Gilliam's Twelve Monkeys, which is not easily decipherable but like The Fountain asks the viewer to do some mental exercise and not just be bleached over with the predictability of moving from point A to point B.Firstly, hats off to Brian Emerich and his crew. The sound design was amazing. Muted city noise toppled by the snow crunching footsteps of Jackman amplify how alone the character is in his quest while being surrounded by so many. From the sounds of intergalactic breakfast cooking in his cosmic conveyance, to the hairs whispering back in response to the sound of Hugh's voice summon the sense of beguiling sound that so rarely tantalizes a film audience. The score composed by Clint Mansell was mostly complimentary which I didn't find it as plodding as others have stated. If placed, I would have to say it sounded somewhere in the realm of Japanese-existentialist-keyboard-ponder-fest to music found in film classics such as Heat (night scenes of De Niro riding in his camaro) and Uncle Buck (listen to the scene sequence directly after Buck scares Bug with a 12 inch drill bit).Trippy visual effects like kicking out the stars will send the most skeptical cerebrally enhanced big gulp drinker into gooey awe. Golden showers (it's a sci-fi thing, sorry) raining down and morning light brought in through the castle walls to illuminate Rachel Weiz are just a few of the optical morsels to take in.The interweaving of time works fairly well, offering the circadian dimensions of time as plausible reality. Though I had trouble understanding the end fully or how Weiz's character became a tree in a bubble but I settled my thought's bones around it. It is just flat out confusing to know the origins of the future role Jackman plays. Where does he come from? Has he been traveling since present day? This part is so esoteric; I'm willing to bet when asked this question the witchiest of Mayan witch doctors would hop the 1st thing smoking back to Central America.The whole concept of drifting through space working towards one seemingly ridiculous goal is futile but isn't that what so many of us do with our lives? The whole idea of eternal life wasn't in the main character's head until the Queen (Weiz) put it there. The roles for Hugh must have been exceedingly exhausting. He is (in many scenes) on the cusp of breaking down and in others his voice exudes the total frailty of an emotionally ruptured soul. His character was born to fulfill his loyalty (duties to Spain in the face of cultural cancer) and love is plainly a mission millions carry out and strives to protect everyday on our planet. Maybe I just can't see the harm in a kid walking out of the theater saying, ""Dad, when I grow up I want to be a tai chi astronaut.""If we're accepting that God is at the helm regarding the film's universe, then the fact that present day Hugh is a brain surgeon and she has a tumor is totally plausible. If God is the great designer and time is circular, why wouldn't he just update the repeated lives we all live? He can't stop humans from advancing mentally but if he's in charge of time spent doesn't he write the fate of our eternal tickets? Hugh's character rails against all physical laws beset upon us. Religious or not I think its safe to say we can all agree that death is the inevitable equalizer.This film is unique and because it does contain some grey area in its storyline, it makes for a highly debatable piece of work. Aside from that this film is definitely worth going to the theater for to obtain the overwhelming sensation you cant get on DVD.",,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
The Road to Awe,"Greetings again from the darkness. Interesting, open to interpretation film from the brilliant mind of writer/director Darren Aronofsky. The film spans over 1000 years, but the three stories are presented in a non-linear manner so as to encourage thought and discussion. The whole topic of everlasting life or death as a disease could and has filled numerous research papers. Mr. Aronofsky brings his unique visual element to the topics.The two leads are played well enough by Hugh Jackman and Rachel Weisz. Jackman's look spans that of Mick Fleetwood as a conquistador, TV's Dr. House in the present, and the zen of David Carradine in the future. Regardless of the era, he spends the entire film extremely agitated with a constant frown. Weisz, on the other hand, makes a lovely queen, a perky dying lady and sickly tree. Supporting help is provided by Ellen Burstyn (making up for her horrible turn in ""The Wicker Man"") and the powerful Stephen McHattie as The Inquistor.Each story has a frenetic pace and the climax of Jackman discovering ""The Fountain"" is pretty well done. This one doesn't score higher due to lack of connection to the two main characters in any period of time. We just aren't really given any reason to care.Although not in the class of ""PI"" and certainly not the excellence of ""Requiem for a Dream"", Mr. Aronofsky delivers another thought provoking visual feast that will be loved by many and hated by some.",6.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
An under-appreciated gem.,"I can't think of sentences to describe this movie that don't include 'amazing.The visual scenes are simply breathtaking - some of the best I've ever seen, which is impressive considering it's not even the main point of the film.The acting is superb, with the two leads creating a romance I felt deeply.The themes are pretty obviously metaphysical. It's about death, and facing up to death. It draws from a lot of places, but in its conclusions I'd say it's very Eastern Mysticism.The loss that our hero faces (without spoiling anything) was devastating; the combined impact of the film left me deeply moved and I'll admit, feeling very sad. I guess you can't ask for more than that.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
Great drama highly recommended,"One of the most peculiar and unsettling directors of the current scene, Darren Aronofsky, poses in The Fountain a narrative supported by three existential planes that intertwine to shape a declaration of love beyond death. Somewhere between reality, fiction of a novel and a spiritual journey to the edge of space and time, this allegory about eternal love should not leave anyone indifferent by its narrative richness, the visual component and the excellent interpretive work of the cast. Hugh Jackman, whose career (launched by the role of Wolverine) is in his zenith after works of great commercial push as The Prestige or X-Men: The Last Stand, delight us with an excellent dramatic register that is, probably, the most demanding role of his career. Meanwhile Rachel Weisz, who stole my impartiality in The Constant Gardener, maintains the high level of the film and captivates with her pale beauty. Dazzling us with an amazing colorful photography and an excellent soundtrack by Clint Mansell (in his 3rd collaboration together after Pi and Requiem for a Dream), we are in front of the 97 minutes more sensitives i can remember in a long long time on a cinema seat. The one who sees the most striking images of the promotional trailer and waits an epic film, probably will be disappointed. I recommend going to see it without preconceptions and every nerve predisposed to feel; you will like it or not, but you must recognize the extraordinary intensity of the film and you can not deny that is an unusual concept. Aronofsky has again done it with a usual tale told like never before.",9.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
Artsy Romance,"I liked the film. Its part romance and part Art House. A medical researcher played by Hugh Jackman struggles in a race against time to develop a new drug using primates as test studies that may latter have uses to cure his terminally ill wife (Rachel Weisz). His ultimate goal is to refine his discovery to both extend life and stop the aging clock while eliminating tumor growths.What the film is great at is conveying the emotions the characters are going through such as fear, dread, love and will to live. The cinematography can be trippy because the director uses the metaphorical and symbology which does require some active participation from the audience to understand.I do agree the lighting wasn't the best.

I would not want to see this again...,"So many positive comments of this film from other viewers??... I'm glad some people got value from this movie... but...I tend to judge movies by how they affect me, touch me, cause me to think, move me in some way. ""The Fountain"" did not. I sat through the whole movie waiting for some meaningful metaphor or other redeeming quality to an otherwise 2-dimensional, very flat experience.Technically, there were some excellent visuals. But the story and it's point I thought could have been accomplished in a 7-minute music/visuals video. Many times I felt like I was in the midst of a film trying to be an ""Enigma"" album... but with no touching of the soul.First, I'll say I tend to compare ""art"" films (which I think ""The Fountain"" is trying to be), filmmakers and film-making with the masters, such as Tarkovsky (my favorite) and Kurosawa.The general lighting was not good, and was awkward in my opinion. There is a time and place to create a mood thru light... but to maintain the same nightmarish bleak lighting thru-out the whole film is huge saturation and overkill, to emotion and mood. I became de-sensitized essentially. I think for the horror genre, this is O.K. But even Tarkovsky, the master of the use of light in film to create mood, impressions, and metaphors, would not resort to creating or trying to maintain mood in this way, not without tight editing and a suitable storyline. I honestly kept feeling that the lighting was being used to compensate for what I thought was a potentially interesting... but weakly executed storyline and editing. I understand what Aronofsky was trying to accomplish... but this reminds me of a young, inexperienced chef over-spicing food to compensate for inexperience... when the master chefs use very subtle, skilled, varied and sparing use of spice.Same with the same repeated string and synthesized pieces of musical score... same thing again and again and again... instead of varying the score for depth and mood, for story progression.I did not like the many replays of scenes that were repeated again and again and again. I understand this repeating also, but I judge the use of this technique on whether the story is carried further or deepened in some way. Kurosawa's ""Rashomon"" is a perfect example of a master's skillful use of repeated scenes, and in fact this was the idea behind ""Rashomon"". I honestly felt that some of ""The Fountains"" repeated scenes were repeated NOT to carry the story... but to fill screen time.I really like Hugh Jackman as an actor. But I don't think this was a good role for him. I could not feel for his characters, at all. His characters' angst and pain were constant, 2-dimensional, a bit over-acted I think, and felt not real... not human. I just could not connect with his characters (and I have some experience with death). But I'm not sure if it was Jackman, the script, or a combination.Rachel Weisz's acting was one of the few redeeming qualities, in my opinion, of the movie. I thought she did a great job with the material she had. Her characters had depth, a human feel, and I quickly connected with her characters.Although I'm very spiritual... the spirituality in this movie also felt 2-dimensional to me, and ""pseudo"" (contrived). Something someone developed in Hollywood. It did not connect with me cohesively on a Christian level, or any other religion for that matter. There was a little theology behind it, of course, but the movie was an incohesive and somewhat disorganized mix of a few different spiritual concepts, in my opinion. I gained no new insights into life, death, love, loss, etc. I'll mention ""The Sacrifice"" as a film to compare it with, on a spiritual level. But there is no comparison between the two.I also judge a film by whether I want to see it again, and try to gain more from it. ""The Mirror"" is a good example. Tough film to watch emotionally and it takes a lot out of you, but a fresh re-viewing is worth it because I gain something more for the effort, every time. But with ""The Fountain"", I have no desire at all to see it again. I can gain nothing further from it. Apparently some other viewers can. All I can say is go for it and more power to you.Overall, there were a few redeeming qualities... but nothing that would bring me back to see it again.",4.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
The best film ever.,"The best film ever. Fantastic music. Fantastic look. The most amazing performance of Hugh Jackman.I really love this work of Darren Aronofsky.

Disappointing piece from Aronofksy,"I am a pretty big fan of Darren Aronofsky and his work, but this film falls flat. It's not bad, mind you, it does an adequate job of telling its story with style; it just doesn't approach the level of awe that I am used to feeling after watching one of his films. I was dumbstruck after watching Requiem of a Dream. I wasn't after seeing The Fountain. Plus, it was rather difficult to watch. A plodding and irrational plot just didn't meld things together well. Visually, a very stunning film. Psychologically... kind of torturing. If you haven't seen it, give it a shot though, as this is one of those films that is very personal in nature and many love it.

There is literally no comprehensive plot, even including analyzing this through the lens of the Vedas, etc. It is New Age pap that goes nowhere, does nothing, and means nothing.Horrible!

"Oh it's beautiful but, the story line ? Oh the story is intermangled.","I agree with what this person said so I copied and put it here as my comment. Kinda like what most established Screenwriters do when Writers send in Treatments and Screenplays to an Agent who pawns it off to those established screenwriter's. Yeah, their best ideas get extracted and used in someone else's work:""the plot structure wasn't as cohesive as it could've been. the intermingling of time dimensions is nothing new, however for this movie it was abit jumpy and required the audience more effort in deciphering it's flow rather than enjoying a good story. The visuals were stunning awesome but didn't lend any true significance to the storyline. as a special effect it's cool, but there was no solid relevance to the story. for instance, with bullet-time and frame freezing there is relevance with what is going on in the scene and how it works as a function of the movies story and plot. Whereas in ""Fountain"" all you get is beautiful imagery with music that doesn't particularly drive the story forward. It's non-functional imagery. But that's okay, I enjoyed it. However for a movie, no, I can see where this sound and imagery would be really cool with some fine Columbian Gold and a water bong ! 3 stories, 3 time dimension, is a worn out idea. however it works for this ""movie"" sort of.When I watched it( 4 hours ago ) I caught the Holiday Season crowd, so a lot of people were already giddy. Wolverine was easier chuckled at or hissed at depending on what type of emotion he was trying to evoke. I thought he was doing well since I didn't get to see the last X-men movie. People still look at him as Wolverine so that kinda ruined it for them. Rachel was immaculate in her acting, and if it wasn't for her, the movie wouldn't have much substance. I mean her acting was excellent. Some of the visuals made no sense and were quite distracting. It's almost as if the Director has all these fantastic ideas in front of him and didn't know what to do, so he just through them all together with no concern as to how they'd make sense.The movie is better viewed as an Art piece like most viewers have already said. So, this is not a movie in the traditional sense, but tries to be one. Actually, I was bored and thought the visuals provided some thought provocation, the story line was not cohesive enough to drive any meaningful point that I already couldn't decipher from a few lines of dialog or a still image.I figure the screenwriter needed more time with the content. this movie had so much potential but it seemed thrown together without any refining. And, indeed, it needs a lot of refining to be considered seriously. therefore, I conclude that ""the fountain"" is no ""The Matrix"" but it was a good try for the Director in trying to do something different.

Yes, I didn't get at least 30% of the movie, but that didn't matter to me so much.Some people might find this movie pretentious. I'd say 'niche' for now. What I liked is that I deeply cared for the protagonists. There are real emotions on screen here, the acting is terrific.

"'Fountain' confusing until well after movie is over, but fantastic visionary ride","Two lovers are followed over the span of a thousand years. What they discover about each other is a story of love, death, spirituality and the essence of hope. I think. Darren Aronofsky's latest visual ride is ""The Fountain,"" starring Hugh Jackman (""X-Men"") and Rachel Weisz (""The Mummy""). The story revolves around their love throughout the past, present and future. In the past, Tomas (Jackman) is a soldier of Spain in 1500, sent by the queen (Weisz) to find the Tree of Life. Finding it will save Spain, and as she says it, make the queen the Eve to Tomas's Adam. In the present, Tommy is a scientist and his wife, Izzi, has cancer that has spread to her brain. Tommy is obsessed with finding a cure for Izzi, shutting out everyone and everything to save his beloved. His lab has a sample of the Tree of Life and hopes to eventually use it on Izzi so they can be together forever. In the future, Tom Creo is an astronaut in a ship, taking the Tree of Life to a dying star in order to reunite with his lost lover. The movie itself is confusing. If you expect to go to the theater and see three stories in a row, you are very wrong. The movie switches from all three eras, getting pieces of information throughout each scene to eventually piece together the final conclusion. Before seeing the movie, I researched and saw that most people would not get the movie, and that you should pay attention to everything in order to pick up on what is going on. Well I did, and I walked out of the theater like a six-year-old who was just told to memorize calculus. I was utterly confused. ""The Fountain"" is a ride that takes massive thinking and attention. Symbolism is everywhere. From the constant colors and camera views, to the meaning of each action in every scene. Anything major event that occurs means something to the rest of the movie and all three eras. The movie involves many different themes and thoughts, especially dealing with spirituality. The story of Adam and Eve, the Tree of Life and the Tree of Knowledge, the Mayan First Father story, the book Izzi writes, the missing wedding ring, the seven deadly sins and so on. Everything in the movie has a meaning. What seems like three different stories ends up being a story that is all woven together by the end with the common goal of love. Characters go through the same experiences in different times, with almost the same outcome each time. But believe me, it is not that simple. 'The Fountain"" has a beautiful tone to it. It is shot fantastically, and Aronofsky is well on his way to being one of the most visually intriguing and thought-provoking directors of our time. Aronofsky's previous film, ""Requiem for a Dream,"" is a depressing yet fantastic movie. It was the reason I wanted to explore this film, and it ends up being something completely unique and different. I didn't get this movie until I got home and read the hundreds of posts on the movie. In fact, I still don't have it all pieced together. If you want a film that you can just sit back and enjoy without thinking, do not see this film. It is really hard to get and absorb, and it's one of those movies that you could enjoy more after leaving the theater and discussing it. I hated the movie after it ended, and had to read and read about it before I got what happened. Now I want to see it again to catch everything I missed, which was about 60% of the film. Jackman and Weisz are simply amazing. Originally, Brad Pitt and Cate Blancett were slotted for this film, and I am glad that changed. I can't see Pitt giving the emotion or depth that Jackman gives in the film. The two are simply stunning, and give performances that are more than nomination worthy. It is one of those movies that is enhanced tremendously by the performances of the actors. So, if you give this movie a try, get ready for a complicated ride. Watch for everything, absorb every sentence, statement or action. It is a great movie concealed by visual mystery and story-telling, and definitely worth a second look. So be prepared to be confused, tested, and enthralled. ""The Fountain"" is a one of a kind film, if you are up for a challenge and a thought- provoking experience.

"An inspired article in an over-expensive, mostly uninspired, era of cinema.","Darren Aronofsky, through his long and tedious struggle to bring his most cherished script to the screen, had accumulated some serious hype around what would eventually become 'The Fountain.' Just under seven years from its conception in the mind of the film's young leader, Aronofsky's richly imaginative story of everlasting love, biblical symbolism, mortality, and boundless metaphysical possibilities hit the Cannes Film Festival with divided acclaim.'The Fountain' starts with a 16th century Spanish conquistador named Tomas (Jackman), who appears to have come across a hidden temple, which rightfully rests amidst the thick ripe foliage of the jungle's core. Subsequent to the slaughter of his miniature battalion, Tomas fights his way through a heavy pack of temple guards, then climbs a steep slope of stairs to reach his desired pyramid's peak. Upon scaling the tall side of the lost temple, the film takes a spontaneous turn into a world of wondrous nothing, where we find a clean-shaven Hugh Jackman in an ecospheric-like bubble, floating toward a golden nebula in the vast realm of outer space.Just before the film could possibly become any more confusing, it swings back to a present day world, where oncologist, Dr. Tommy Creo, has been sleeplessly perusing the potential effects of the contents of a tree in Guatemala, which could stop the continuation of cancerous tumors and rejuvenate their victims. Of course, what would this ""love story"" be without the dying, cancer-stricken wife to motivate the tormented scientist-husband? The premise of the flick, being as dubious as would potentially seem, never reaches a melodramatic staleness; in fact, it prospers from its simple, yet intricate, story of undying love. In little time, 'The Fountain' saves itself from disaster, as it finally comes together, piece by piece, and finishes an open-minded work of art, rather than another box-office blunder. Aronofsky's intentions envelope in the thoughts of each viewer, as the journey closes with doors that remain open; and do so in a semi-satisfying quest to provoke questions and lengthy discussions with all movie-goers who shared its viewing.The positives of the picture bask in their gorgeous surrealism, and flow through viewers with poetical sage. Captained by its veteran actor, Hugh Jackman, and supported well enough by Academy Award-winning actress Rachel Weisz, the ostentatious ship of visual wonders that was 'The Fountain,' succeeds as a summer trip to the movies with its unmatched creativity and fine direction; from the only director who could have pulled off such an inspired article in our over-expensive, mostly uninspired, era of cinema. To unleash one's intellectual inventiveness is to see 'The Fountain;' dismissing any flaws in film-conception and appreciating where it all came from.",7.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"

Cardio for the soul.,"This film sets a precedent for it's lack of ego and originality. It's concepts of humans being creatures capable of immortal love and energy are ideals not so easily conveyed. Aronofsky takes a monumental theme and shapes it into an easily digestible fairy tale. A lovely movie that, no surprise here, didn't really make any money at the box office. There are no pop-culture references and very few laughs. Unlike the frenetic, fast paced motoring of PI and Requiem for a dream, ""The Fountain"" floats along like a sailboat, causing ripples in our subconscious that resonate long after the movie has concluded. For anyone who worries about our purpose and place in the order of nature, this movie gives a blessing of hope.",9.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
"Do I like it?....no,but I can appreciate it, and know it is a work of art.","This movie has had an infamous reputation amongst my circle of friends, and for good reason.The plot: Spread between three time lines (past, present and future{I think}) it movie tells a story of a conquistador searching for the fountain of youth. A doctor trying find a cure for his ill wife, and the future: Which is so abstract all I can say is a man trying to save a tree?The writing: Is good, the story lines I understood made sense and are filled with symbolism about; life, death , and the after life. The characters interactions are well written and the relations between Hugh Jackman's characters and Rachel Weisz's characters are quite compelling (both of them play a ""different"" character in each timeline. Sadly I did find the three stories as a whole hard to enjoy as I spent most of the movie trying to figure out what is supposed to be happening. This led me to become more bored than intrigued. I thought the most compelling story is the one of the past, as it is both intriguing and understandable. The story line in the present seemed to be overly dramatic as the characters are not given enough development for me to empathize with them. The future story line is enjoyable to watch, but I did not really understand it.I would compare this movie with the novel ""One Hundred Years Of Solitude"" by Garcia Marquez, not only with its dream atmosphere but because of the time lapses are similar.The acting: The lead actors in this movie were good, but they seemed to be secondary. Most of the movies strengths lie in its script and atmosphere. This is not to say no emotions are conveyed by the actors as Jackman and Weisz give a full on performance. This performance also demanded a myriad of emotions to be displayed in sequence and the leads do a great job during these scenes.The cinematography: I thought this was the best part of the movie. The interloping cuts between time lines are done really, and the imaginative environments created are filled with mystique. We are taken to the deep South American jungles, to an tranquil garden reminiscent to that of distant galaxies, and more moderate scene in a gloomy hospital. The lighting ranged from high contrasts to darker softer lights (depending on the timeline). The contrasting atmospheres of the three story lines some how meshed well together and this is definitely credited to Aronofsky's visionary direction.The score: Mostly filled with strings to convey emotion and emphasize the drama in each scene. It works well with the movie and is not jarring in any way, but is nothing spectacular.If you are in the mood for something abstract that will take you to places only in our imaginations watch this movie. However if one is unable to appreciate the arts do not watch this movie without someone who does so one may be able to appreciate this masterfully created film.7.5/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"

Like a lot of artistic endeavors, this film goes beyond the bounds of reality, which some may find off-putting.The trick with this film is that the story is nonlinear. In other words you have to watch all of it to make sense of the pieces, resulting in many ""wait, what?"" moments throughout. Considering what this movie is trying to convey, I'm a bit shocked by the relatively short runtime. I think because of the shorter length, the parts do not feel overly drawn out.

"Intriguing film, problematic, but intriguing","I'd been very interested in this film from the time it began production. It's Aronofsky. He's no Scorsese, but I was excited. Pi is a great film and Requiem is problematic, but a good film nonetheless. Also the knowledge that it had taken him nearly six years to finish this film intrigued me. That said, the film is totally misrepresented by the trailer. It's not nearly as 'sci-fi' as they want you to think it's going to be. (Though not everyone will agree, I think it's a good thing). The film is beautifully shot, incredible landscapes and color washes. Jackman gives a solid performance. But Weisz's character is the stock, moderately eccentric woman that seems to be popping up more and more in American 'independent' cinema. She was Kate Winslet in Eternal Sunshine, was Julianne Moore in Children of Men, was Nora Zehtner in Brick. The story exists in three separate settings, 1500 CE Spain, present-day America, and an undefined futuristic sequence (which may or may not be nothing more than Hugh Jackman's character trying to deal with his life). These settings have nothing to do with time- travel or anything sci-fi at all, they are logical extensions of the psyche of these complex characters. It's high concept and interesting, well shot, and never really crosses any dangerous thresholds, into the realms of laborious exercises in cinematic experiments, but it's, nonetheless, problematic. So what do I think? See it. The whip shot motif is beautiful, good cinematography and an interesting screenplay, but I wouldn't go so far as to say that anyone would actually fall in love with the film.",7.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
lost opportunity or just lost?,"I wanted to like this movie. I really did. But it just didn't work for me.It's been less than a week since I watched The Fountain and I can hardly remember any of it now. I recall a few very nice visuals, a handful of interesting moments, and some intriguing concepts that were introduced and then left undeveloped, squeezed out in favor of the same teary, dreary terminal illness / love story melodrama we've all seen a hundred times before.I might have enjoyed it anyway if any of the characters were particularly likable or compelling. They weren't. The very wonderful Ellen Burstyn was wasted in an underwritten role that could have been played by anyone. My Name is Earl's goofy brother kept lurking around in the background and throwing off my concentration. Rachel Weisz, who demonstrated no acting skill other than the ability to look luminous, was nearly insufferable as the earthbound angel / saint. Wolverine seemed semi-conscious and totally confused (not that I could blame him), except when he was blissed out and tumbling through space in full lotus (impressive).I didn't really care one way or the other what happened to anyone, who died or who didn't (it was hard to tell). The non-linear presentation of the 3 timelines / stories was frustrating and incoherent; the attempted spiritual revelations and insights were trite and fell flat.I generally enjoy being challenged by movies that play with time, space, presentation, the rules of reality, and the conventions of storytelling, but The Fountain was so short on substance that it was almost entirely empty of meaning for me as a result.

Monty Pythons Meaning of Life Part 2- The Serious Version,"Aronofsky is one of the most innovative filmmakers in Hollywood today. With each passing film he tries different stories and styles that makes each distinct and memorable. His films won't always be for everyone, but like many great filmmakers he will constantly try new ideas for both his stories narrative and their visual style. Luckily in the case of The Fountain his style flourishes exploring themes of death and immortality. Whilst it did not originally get its money back on release I have no doubt that in time this will go on to be one of his best remembered films.Largely this is because the way the film is shot has a timeless feel. Just like you can watch something like 2001: A Space Odyssey and feel that it could have been made today, through this films practical effects and unique visuals it feels as though it is unlikely to become outdated over time. Each passing visual is a pleasure to look at with the films vivid use of colour and varying set pieces ensuring each passing shot has something new to interest us and no two shots feeling alike.This visual style is effective within the film as it follows 3 different narratives, which the shooting style separates through different styles and set pieces to better distinguish the stories that are set across a thousand years. The only thing that does link the stories are the themes of escaping death, the lead actors (Hugh Jackman and Rachel Weisz) and the similar symbols such as trees symbolising life in all three stories.All of these stories are done in a similar style to something like Cloud Atlas, in that the plots are mixed with no real sense of narrative with events happening non linearly to better build upon the themes of the story. The first of the time lines sees Jackman travelling to a Mayan temple during the renaissance, attempting to become immortal through the tree of life spoke of within the bible. The second follows him as a doctor in the modern day attempting to find a way of curing his wives tumour using a tree that has been found to reverse the ageing progress. And the third is set in the future where he transcends to the stars as just like the Mayan gods intends to become a seed on which the planets may grow.In each of these stories Jackman searches for immortality in a different route. Whether he looks for it through journeying through the forest, through science or travelling the stars, Jackman demonstrates the ways in which a person may search for meaning in life. It's a difficult thing maintaining all 3 different roles, but luckily Jackman's perfect for it using an effective emotional and physical change for each story. It's these distinctions that ensure the story works because we can contrast the different pains that Jackman goes through in each story with each one seeming original rather than just a rehash each time.These different stories can be seen in many ways, with Aronofsky deliberately being vague of its meaning so just like any other great piece of art may be interpreted in many ways. Personally, whilst watching it, I realised that whilst he has been searching for a way of escaping death, he has barely had any time to be with his wife and thus by the end is left with only a few fleeting memories. Furthermore in various scenes we see his attempts at immortality backfire and cause him great pain and suffering, with the entire hour and a half seeing him experience little joy. It thus raises the question of why extend life if it cannot be enjoyed.But this is just my interpretation of the film.The way the film is done it is very open to interpretation, which is one of the main reasons it is so great. I've only just watched it but I know that I'll be wanting to watch it again soon to see what else I can learn from it, because the film seems to have that much to say that I feel I can gain even more from a second viewing. There's so much in the film that I couldn't possibly explain it all in this short review and would strongly recommend watching it to see what you can get from the film. As long as you're open to the depressing tone of the story, you should be able to enjoy the interesting themes and stunning visuals of this underrated masterpiece.",9.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"

Flawed but true,"If Pi took us through the trials of purgatory and Requiem For A Dream gave us a taste of hell then there is something heavenly about Darren Aronofsky's latest. Clearly he never had in mind to limit his intimate romantic drama to the confines of genre, feasibility, or even planet Earth. The film has predictably polarised the opinion of critics. It seems that the more personal the vision, the more extreme the critical response; whenever a vision such as Aronofsky's comes along the condemnation is vicious and the praise is lavish.He could have done what he wanted after the stupendously grim Requiem for a Dream. The marketing bods must have been cracking their knuckles in glee when they'd found someone who shot violent neo-noir who they could sell as the new David Fincher. But instead he ended up six years later completing a metaphysical love story, full of light, and ultimately hopeful.Some critics have made comparisons between this and Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey, but I believe thematic comparisons are erroneous. Certainly, the film provides similar challenges (and possibly confusion) for its audience. But 2001 had bigger fish to fry - the post-Nietzschean rebirth of God, no less - while The Fountain is filmed in close-up. 2001 was about the power of Man; The Fountain is about one powerless man and his inevitable defeat.Regardless of whether you find The Fountain mysterious and moving or a pretentious bore, Aronofksy's conviction is undeniable. In an industry steadily becoming saturated with product placement sequels and depressing remakes, it's refreshing to lie back and be presented with a truly unique vista. It's as much about capturing a single emotion - the most elusive of all - as it is about telling a story. And, if nothing else, life in a Petri dish sure looks pretty.",7.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
The Fountain,"This is a film about acceptance of death.The general tone of this film is earthy, dreamy, and calm.All visuals are carefully composed and very pleasant to the eyes, because Aronofsky is the kind of director who knows his lenses. The music, scored by Aronofsky's long time collaborator Clint Mansell, is captivating and inspiring.Aronofsky's script is experimental and a bit coarse, but full of strong details. The characters are a bit one-dimensional, but skilled actors give them sufficient depth.The film features one simple main narrative, and two parallel fantasy narratives (with lots of elaborate fantasy imagery). The main narrative takes place in the present. The fantasy narratives take place in the past and in the future respectively.The fantasy narratives are not realistic or logical, nor are they supposed to be. Unfortunately this is confusing, and some viewers seem to believe that something super complex is happening and that they need to understand it like in one of those ""Inception""-type movies. But that is wrong. The fantasy narratives are more like dream sequences, used to express stuff about the main narrative in a more powerful, visual language which is more accessible to the unconscious.The fantasy narratives are fast paced, which prevents boredom, but the drawback of this is that there is not much time to build mood. Therefore the mood building seems a little clumsy at times, and some moments which are intended to produce sadness or goosebumps might make you chuckle instead, or you'll find them pretentious. But the artist's intention is always clear and I was willing to stay with Aronofsky's vision and take all scenes serious in order to enjoy the film.This film is definitely a break from the boring Hollywood conveyor belt. It bombed at the box office which suggests that most people dislike it. But some people will love it, and so do I.",9.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
"Visually stunning, but story lacks some depth","When I first saw the trailer for The Fountain, I was very eager to watch. Being a fan of both Hugh Jackman and Rachel Wies I knew that I'd be in for a great movie. The plot seemed very interesting and the director has a history of great work.The first few minutes of the movie are a bit perplexing. I kept thinking to myself, ""What is going on?"" As the film progresses, one catches the intertwined stories. The film had the potential to be more. The Fountain is visually stunning. The transitions are fairly smooth between the different stories, and sometimes even seamless. I would've preferred the movie to take more of the sci-fi route. The whole idea behind the myth of the tree is very intriguing, but is never dealt with in much detail.This film definitely leaves its audience asking questions. The Fountain is a different kind of film, but it was worth watching.",6.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
"The timeless themes - life, love, death and beyond...","I've watched The Fountain several times now, and it has never disappointed.The Fountain is a superb piece of story-telling and movie making - there are so many small details that accumulate to create what in the end is a significant and satisfying result - with epic proportions.The canvas is enormous, and managed impressively. These are the themes of life and creation itself. Threads that are, in a way, reminiscent of Mishima's Sea of Fertility tetralogy.There is a dream like sense to the unfolding of its story and the grasping of its reality - a dream with a cosmic resolution and dimension.A captivating movie experience.Aronofsky's collaboration with Clint Mansell (and the Kronos Quartet) has also paid off, the score and musical performance is extraordinary and provides an important layer of continuity linking the 'parts' of the movie together. Even the credits roll to a haunting solo piano accompaniment that draws on the preceding energy of the films tumultuous ending - that is mesmerising.Rachel Weisz's performance is one of her finest - subtle and absorbing.This is a seriously under-rated movie that deserves greater recognition.",9.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
A  movie about life everlasting that makes you wish you were dead,"I'm having a hard time memorizing all the names of the reviewers here that think this is a wonderful movie, so I can avoid anything they recommend.The Fountain is one of the worst films I've ever seen. It could have been made by a blissed out religious cultist whose brain keeps clicking back to the preceding thought like a broken record. There's Izzi and her other incarnations smiling beatifically, crying soulfully. There she is again, and again and again doing the same thing. There is Tommy puzzled, smiling, crying, angry, and there he is again, and again and again. I'm sure I've seen this scene before and before that and before that. What a long dragged out boring piece of pretentious pseudo spiritual garbage it is.The special effects are nice to look at but also repeated ad nauseum. The musical score is decent and that's it. Hugh Jackman is a good actor but not here. Rachel Weisz isn't a good actress and is even worse here. I guess you can blame the writer and director for this, and the constant close ups and extreme closeups. I couldn't believe that Aranofsky, who made this bomb, also made The Wrestler. He didn't write The Wrestler so that explains some of the difference, but he directed and I guess he just improved greatly as a director in the two year interval between the films.The Fountain is an embarrassment for all involved.",1.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"

A lyrical and ethereal meditation on love and death!,"The FountainLast night while I was watching ""The Fountain"" a large obnoxious crowd of young college students were laughing during powerful moments of ""The Fountain"", maybe they were to daft or ignorant to appreciate the genius of it, or just possible they went in expecting X-Men 4 or something, after the film ended and the credits were running they were criticizing the film and saying the most immature insults I think I ever heard in a movie theater. It then clicked to me that while that crowd thought they were superior to the film, Darren Aronofsky is already five steps ahead of them.There are also apologies from film critics indicating that that ""The Fountain"" is too confusing, and complex. What the hell, are we getting to that level now where we have to apologize to audiences because a film isn't straightforward enough? Darren Aronofsky's bold and beautiful film ""The Fountain"", is quite negative on rottentomatoes.com at the moment, I feel as if the audiences have transformed and hi-jacked film critics. It may be non-linear, but it's quite a philosophical, ethereal journey of memory, loss, and regret.Let's not forget such masterpieces as ""2001: A Space Odessy"", ""Eraserhead"", ""Blue Velvet"", ""Peeping Tom"", ""A Clockwork Orange"", and most recently ""The Passion of the Christ"", ""The New World"", were all poorly received by many critics in their release, but are now considered classics. If ""The Fountain"" admirers join together, and the elite critics stay together (Chud.com, Glenn Kenny from Premiere also loved it) and if the film receives a cult following it will reach that status.It's been six long years since Darren Aronofsky has directed a film, and let me tell you, the wait is worth it. ""The Fountain"" in many aspects is like a sci-fi Terrence Malick film, the lyrical direction, the visual poetry, the inaccessible storytelling is all there. The result is a beautifully heartbreaking, visually sublime, hypnotic meditation of nature, love, and identity. It's a film where you avoid to make sense of it, and just surrender yourself with the rhythm and flow.More of an experience, then a film; ""The Fountain"" will you leave you speechless from start to finish, and when it's over you'll be perplexed by the experience. Director Aronofsky, in his third film, is by far the most ambitious project of his career. In 1998 Aronofsky made the most explosive film debut since David Lynch's ""Eraserhead"". It was strikingly shot and artfully maddening film debut that put Aronofsky on the map. Aronofsky has always had sci-fi elements throughout his work; ""Pi"" invoked the paranoia of Franz Kafka within high-contrast black and white, within fuzzy framework. ""The Fountain"" like his other films are demanding works of provocation.Aronofsky's second film was absolutely remarkable; ""Requiem for a Dream"" was an intense, and disturbing film that perfectly captured the horrors of drug-addiction. Aronofsky proved with ""Requeim"" that he was a first-rate filmmaker of intelligent ideas, subjectivity, and style.Aronosky has done it again, his direction in ""The Fountain"" is nothing short of extraordinary. Like a Terrence Malick film, it transports you in a world of beauty, and despair. More of a film that relies on imagery, and visual storytelling instead of linear narrative, ""The Fountain's"" powerful imagery speaks for itself, Aronofsky philosophizes the process of life, death, existence, nature, reincarnation, and how true love and life can never decay.Chronicling three centuries spanning from the 16th, the present, and 26th century, in the midst of 500 years separating each story. ""The Fountain"" is essentially a love saga; each story is a repetition of one man's passion, destiny, and love that lies in a tree of immortality. In the present story, Tom (Hugh Jackman) is a scientist in which is wife Isabel (Rachel Weisz) is on the verge of dying from a severe brain tumor. Tom struggles to find a cure out of a monkey that can save her life. Meanwhile in the 16th century a conquistador Tomas (also Jackman) is ordered by the Spanish Queen Isabel to voyage to the New World of South America to search in a Mayan temple that secures the everlasting fountain of youth, which is the tree of life where its later revealed that Isabel is writing a novel titled ""The Tree of Life"".In the third and most visually stunning story in the future has Tom (Jackman) again as a bald, despondent longing and meditating in a bubble flying through space and cosmos with the decaying tree inside the bubble. Tom is on a voyage to a star named Xibalia where the Mayan's believe is a heavenly, gateway world of rebirth.The sound of this might sound silly, or absurd, but it's ravishing. The multi-layered, meta narrative is actually balanced with its visual language. The use of camera angles, motifs, zoom/dolly outs, and saturated colors, Aronofsky astonishing direction perfectly creates the melancholy atmosphere. It's a visionary work, that is highly imaginative, lavish, and ambitious. It's going to be an overlooked classic in the making.Aronosky's ""The Fountain"" has already been compared by a few to Stanley Kubrick's ""2001: A Space Odyssey"", and rightfully so. In both audacity, and ambition, Aronofsky's vision is both cerebral and dazzling in execution. However, Aronofsky is more sincere, where Kubrick was more of a cynic. Overall with its poignant, and sentimental ideas of love and life, ""The Fountain"" is the ultimate fragility of hope.Rating **** out of ****",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"

Vastly over rated tripe,"Let me start by saying I adore films with obscure or unique plots that challenge the viewer, I hoped this would be one of them... it was not. It was the most over rated film I've ever watched off the back of a respectable IMDb rating.Any person hoping this was going to be a voyage in to deeper spiritual ideas is going to be left confused because you'll spend the film looking for the deep ideas, only to discover that the deepest it gets is ""we're all going to die"", well excuse my French, but ""No 'do-do' Sherlock"".Anyone wanting twists and turns and an unexpected conclusion is going to be disappointed too, as above, you spend the film hoping for a good twist or original idea, and don't get any.Just because an awful lot of people are giving it 10/10 does not mean this is worth £6.99 of your money, all it means is they saw how pretty the visuals are and most likely didn't understand it (and how shallow and naive the plot was), ergo it must be amazing. Something along the lines of ""It's art because someone arty says it is"".Ironically, the performance from Jackman and Weisz is very good, shame about everything else.So in summary, if you think Hugh Jackman floating in space in the lotus position equates to deep and meaningful, go for it and the best of luck, if you have an IQ over 35 and aren't wowed by pretty images or you just want a story line that has some cohesion and substance then give this one a miss.",1.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"

this year's eternal sunshine...,"Every year there are being released a few art house movies that have a very big potential: a story with several dimensions and every time you watch it you see the movie from a different perspective. Often they have a poetic beauty and are visually stunning. Eternal sunshine was one of those and this year's there another one...I was fortunate to see ""the fountain"" at the gent international film festival (belgium) in the presence of director Darren Aronofsky. In his speech he told he wanted to make a new kind of science fiction movie. No laser guns and stuff like that, but beautiful, poetic images of space...The movie tells the story of a couple: Isabelle(Izzy) & tom. Izzy has a tumor and Tom is a scientist who's trying to find an antidote against dead. This is one of the three stories. The second one is the story Izzy's writing: the fountain (which explains the title) and the third one shows us tom as a space explorer in the 26th century. They're all connected to each other and deal with questions about life & dead, the reason of existence...It's no ordinary science fiction movie, but a poetic tribute about love, dead & existence. Sometimes it's surrealistic and then it reminded me a bit of eternal sunshine.Conclusion: The fountain is a wonderful movie that leaves you more questions than it answers. Every time you'll watch it, you'll get another dimension of it. There'll definitely be loads of people who'll hate this movie, to those people: stay away!

The most indescribably brilliant movie in years.,"This is probably the most difficult film to review ever. The Fountain isn't going to sound like much if I give you just a brief plot synopsis. But I'll give it a go. Tom Creo, a brilliant Doctor, is searching for a cure for cancer. His wife Izzy is dying and his research on Monkeys only seems to mysteriously reverse the ageing process. The secret ingredient to his new medicine is taken from a magic tree in South America. The tree of life, or the fountain of youth. Whatever you want to call it. As Izzy slips away, Tom becomes intrigued with her unfinished novel The Fountain. It turns out that the novel is about Tom and Izzy's past lives as a Spanish Queen and Captain in South America hundreds of years ago. And the only way Tom can finish the book is if he stays around for the future, when he can literally take the long-dead Izzy into the heavens.Phew! That sounds disconcertingly strange, but trust me it's an amazing experience. Hugh Jackman and Rachel Weisz are brilliant, delivering multi-layered performances. The dialogue avoids soap opera clichés of dying young and instead is filled with many philosophic double meanings and a lot of undeclared emotions. I could go on for ages about how good it all is from the direction, gorgeous cinematography, beautiful score, flawless storytelling etc. But I think you get the point already.What The Fountain mostly resembles is the most beautiful, otherworldly dream you've ever had but can barely remember. It's a hypnotic movie filled with moments that will stay with you forever. Just when you think the film has given you all that it has to offer it surprises you with more and more amazing revelations.To deny yourself a movie like this would be a heinous act.

Divine inspiration - this film was made by angels whispering in Aronofsky's ear,"If you haven't seen this film, 13 years have gone by since it was first released, and now all the critics seem to be scrambling to praise it. They should. But what the heck was wrong with them when they damned it, and in so doing caused it to flop commercially? In doing so they doubtless prevented millions of people seeing, and understanding this remarkable raw exposition on love, timeless, undying love and selfless commitment to a cause greater than the self. Maybe, this is why it did not chime with the zeitgeist of our doomed, infernal times.The leads are utterly convincing, in their love and grief and acceptance of what lays beyond. The OST is remarkable in it's own right and commbined with astonishing imagery the effect is one of unbearable emotional inensity.It actually doesn't matter which interpretation of the events you take away, you will never forget the sheer beauty of this film.

"neat visuals, but an over-ambitious plot and a LOT of over-acting","It's good to see a filmmaker really reaching - but I'm finding more and more that, for my taste, Darren Aronofsky had better results when he had more limitations. I'm referring to Pi, of course, definitely my favorite of his films so far, and I'd go so far as to call it a classic of independent film-making.I like Requiem for the most part, but The Fountain, to me, just leans a bit too far on the side of film histrionics too many times.Hugh Jackman's performance is obviously a committed one, but Aronofsky seemed to direct Jackman to just 'act' the crap out of their roles, as well as the other actors - there's very little subtlety in their performances - which is certainly not to say that they aren't capable of it, and haven't achieved it in the past. Virtually all the way through the movie, the principles have these actions and reactions which are, for lack of a better term, over-the-top most of the time. One moment towards the end involving Jackman's character, without giving it away, prompted laughter from some in the audience I was in - and laughter clearly wasn't the intention of that moment.Visually, Aronofsky certainly doesn't disappoint. The look of both the realistic and less-realistic scenes is pretty at worst, and thrilling at best. Again, though, too many times, it feels to me like there's no enough root in the story for some of the visuals to be justified. Great visuals are good - but great visuals can only be truly grant in a movie with deeply motivated reason to be there - by the story and the plot, in my opinion.The story and plot certainly are interesting, and worth at least trying to track with - I was actually most engaged by the present-time story. I'm all for stories and plot that deviate from the standard formula - but I'm of the mind that it has to add up in some fundamental way for the viewer SOMEhow. Clearly it has for many - but it didn't for me or for anyone else I heard from at the screening I attended.This is NOT a bad film - you can do much worse at either the theaters currently or Blockbuster. A lot of people clearly love the film, which is why I was excited about seeing it. I wouldn't say I was let down. While the story is rather refreshing in spite of what I consider to be its problems, and the visuals were nice, I expected more.",3.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"

What if you can live forever?,"The Fountain (2006) -------------------------- Death has always been an institution of fear for humans. So man always tried to find a way to escape from death or the possibility of life after death. As a social animal the death of a person would mostly affect those who are close to him. The pain of living even after the passing away of a loved one lead our mind to think that they will be watching us in their after life and they want us to be happy. - We have to understand that death is unavoidable, ultimately this is what Darren Arnofsky's The Fountain is all about. This movie amazes me every time I watch this movie . After Kubrick's Space Odyssey no other movie has given me such an experience with its visual beauty and its enigmatic nature. --- 3 stories happening in a time interval of 500 years is presented before us through a non-linear narrative. In the year 2006 neuroscientist Dr Tom Creo (Hugh Jackman) is trying to find a cure for his tumor diagnosed wife Izzi (Rachel Weisz). Izzi is writing a book called The Fountain. The book is set in the 16th century Spanish empire. The Spanish empire is loosing to the Inquisition by the Catholic church. As the last hope Queen Isabella decides to send conquistador Tomas to the New Spain in Central America where they believe the Mayans are protecting the Tree of Life. As Izzy calls Tom ""My Conquistador"" playfully she hints that the book is an analogy of their life. She also says that only Tom can finish the last chapter because only he would know the ending. The third story line shows Tommy traveling in a transparent globe like Spaceship with a supposed Tree of life and a pond and a surrounding ecosystem where Tommy keeps talking to the tree and hallucinates about seeing Izzi. Even the remote meaning of what's actually happening here can only be understood at the end of the movie. - It's not clear that if all of these are actually happening or just going through Tom's mind. Even the climax leave you with more questions than answers. The genre of the movie includes a little bit of History, Science fiction, Fantasy, Spirituality etc but the soul of the movie lies ultimately in Love. The Tree of Life from Bible and Mayan belief of creation is main themes of the movie and besides them lot of other cultural influences can be seen throughout the movie. - Hugh Jackman brilliantly played his triple role (triple or single?) and Rachel Weisz mesmerized as Queen Isabella and breaks our heart as Izzi. - Gold and White are the recurring primary colors in the movie. According to the Mayan mythology Xibalba is their underworld which actually is a nebula covering a dead star . Tommy is traveling to reach this golden Xibalba. Golden color shows the meaningless physical entities and wealth and white color shows truth and mortality. --- For decreasing the use of CGI Micro Photography was used to shoot chemical reactions and micro organisms to show Xibalba and some similar sequences. This helped in increasing the timeless visual beauty for the movie. - The movie which was a flop at its release has a strong cult following since then. This movie has a special place in my mind. Its not digestible to everyone but for those can, it will be a great experience.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"

Cheesy mysticism and an implausible love story make for mediocrity,"Aronofsky's long awaited third feature is a bloated, ungainly, pretentious excursion to nowhere in particular. The film is billed as a love saga about the same two people (Hugh Jackman and Rachel Weisz), played out in three stories spanning 1,000 years  past, present and future. That's quite a laugh, since there's plenty of evidence that Jackman's character, Tom, is only capable of self love, pushing his agenda of violence, inattention to his wife, and bullish pursuit of his research, playing by his rules alone.Tom's misbegotten roamings into time travel, parallel worlds and reincarnation are overwrought and largely incomprehensible, especially scenes from the future story in which Tom sits lotus style alongside a gnarly old tree, inside a giant bubble, floating around outer space among lurid animated montages, as if part of some New Agey detergent ad.The proceedings in ""Fountain"" recall films like ""The Illustrated Man"" and Stanley Kubrick's ""2001: A Space Odyssey."" But those films at least were adapted from works by good storytellers: Ray Bradbury (""Man"") and Arthur C. Clarke (""2001""). Unlike ""Fountain,"" ""Illustrated Man"" is a convincing love story. ""2001"" iswell, I'll resist going off on that tangent for the moment. ""Fountain"" was written by Aronofsky and Ari Handel, and the screenplay is not well constructed. (A graphic comic book version, written by Aronofsky and illustrated by Kent Williams, was in fact spawned by the film.)Why is it that otherwise sensible people can sometimes be so thoroughly bamboozled by the cheesy, showy varieties of mysticism served up in films like ""Fountain?"" We see this in the enduring cult adoration of Kubrick's film. More recently we saw it again in the acclaim given to ""What the Bleep Do We Know?"", a sophomoric infomercial for a religious cult up in Yelm, Washington. Are we simply curious about the paranormal? Or does our materialistic, overly politicized culture breed a hunger for the spiritual and mystical? Conversations with smart friends who fall for these puffed up films convinces me it is the latter.Aronofsky's first film, ""Pi"" (1998), was brilliant: the taut, claustrophobic, plausible story of a mathematician's descent into delusion and paranoia. His second feature, ""Requiem for a Dream,"" was messier. An aging woman gets addicted to diet pills trying to become more attractive, while her son and his girlfriend live a heroin junkie life together (in a fashion derivative to earlier, better works like ""Drugstore Cowboy""). Aronofsky's definitely not proceeding in a desirable direction.The best two things in ""Fountain"" are certainly not the principal actors, whose turns are undistinguished (though Aronofsky favorite Ellen Burstyn does a nice cameo as Tom's research supervisor). Nor is it the high tech, high cost animated montages making up the nebula in which Tom's detergent bubble floats about.One good thing is a brief, stunning dance scene in one of the flash forwards to the future, when a dark figure makes slow movements against a starlit but otherwise blackened sky. The other is the pock marked, ferocious Mayan Chieftain in 1535 who looks and acts every inch an ancient bigshot.

"""Death is a disease. There is a cure, and I will find it.""","After the phenomenal critical success of 'Pi' and 'Requiem for a Dream' (neither of which I have yet had the pleasure of seeing), director Darren Aronofsky became recognised as one of the great emerging talents of the decade. His third feature-length offering, released after a six year hiatus, was 'The Fountain,' a film that has universally divided the opinions of reviewers and audiences. For example, though it was booed by many critics at its opening press screening at the 63rd Venice International Film Festival, 'The Fountain' received a ten-minute standing ovation at the public showing the following evening. Not particularly knowing what to expect coming in, I must say that I quite enjoyed it. Though undoubtedly flawed in some regards, 'The Fountain' is ambitious, brilliantly-acted and stunningly beautiful; it's the sort of bold film-making that you love to see a young director try his hands at.The plot of 'The Fountain' is a blurred combination of drama, science-fiction and fantasy. Three thematically-linked narratives  respectively set in the year 1500, the present day, and somewhere around the year 2500  are interwoven throughout the film, each era featuring similar characters played by Hugh Jackman (fresh from Christopher Nolan's 'The Prestige') and Rachel Weisz ('The Constant Gardener'). In the present day, Jackman plays Dr. Tommy Creo, a devoted husband who is dedicating all his time to uncovering a cure for his wife Izzi's (Weisz) terminal brain tumour. Izzi, in her final months, has been writing a novel, entitled ""The Fountain."" The novel, which she would like Tom to complete himself, traces the struggles of a 16th century Spanish conquistador, Tomas (Jackman), to discover the famed Tree of Life in the New World, a mission granted to him by his beloved Queen Isabel (Weisz). The third story, set in the far future  or perhaps merely in Tommy Creo's mind  shows astronaut Tom (Jackman again) travelling towards the golden nebula Xibalba in an ecospheric bubble spacecraft, his only companion a dying tree and occasional visits from present-day Izzi, in spirit form.If all this sounds very confusing to you, then you're not alone. 'The Fountain' really is a film that you have to think about to receive most rewarding movie experience, and multiple viewings are sure to be beneficial in understanding the intricacies of the plot and themes. The ""Conquistador"" portions were certainly inspired by films such as Herzog's 'Aguirre: The Wrath of God' (and, reportedly, Aronofsky based his script on that of Sergio Leone's 'Once Upon A Time in America,' which also employs a flashback structure between three different eras). Originally set to star Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett in the main roles, production of the film was ceased in September 2002 after Pitt left due to script disagreements. However, in 2004, production was restarted (with half the original budget), and Jackman and Weisz were coaxed onboard. Ellen Burstyn, the star of 'Requiem for a Dream' was also hired to appear in the film.With a relatively small budget of about $35 million, Aronofsky chose to limit his spending on visual effects as much as possible. Rather than wasting millions of dollars on lavish CGI, visual effects supervisors Jeremy Dawson and Dan Schrecker discovered macrophotography, which is the extreme close-up photography of chemicals, fluids and bacteria. Peter Parks, who specialises in such photography, explains why such a method was highly suited to the visual effects of the film: ""When these images are projected on a big screen, you feel like you're looking at infinity. That's because the same forces at work in the watergravitational effects, settlement, refractive indicesare happening in outer space."" The final result is a product that generally looks convincing and timeless. However, especially in the final climactic sequence, the effects do begin to show their low-budget origins.Though Aronofsky's dialogue is perhaps a bit simplistic at times, the actors deliver it with a real passion. Hugh Jackman is particularly good during the present-day sequences, and we can only watch with despair as the impending loss of his wife begins to tear him apart from the inside. Rachel Weisz is also very good, and the two actors share a strong chemistry, never leaving us in doubt that their two characters are very much in love with each other. 'The Fountain' is an especially visual film, relying on its vibrant colours and stunning cinematography to inspire emotion. The dying golden nebula, Xibalba, towards which Jackman's astronaut travels is simply beautiful to look at, encompassing all that is beautiful and fascinating about the endless universe. Clint Mansell's score also contributes greatly to the awe-inspiring feel of the film, gradually becoming stronger and stronger in tone, before exploding in a flash of sound and energy for the heart-racing climax.At just over 90 minutes in length, 'The Fountain' is long enough to adequately get its message across, but it ultimately feels as though there could and should be more to it. In my view at least, not nearly enough of the conquistador's journey was shown to us, and, indeed, another filmmaker might even have made that single section into a fascinating feature-length film of its own. 'The Fountain' is often compared to Kubrick's '2001: A Space Odyssey' in tone and style. Though the film itself is probably not even science-fiction  as I'm inclined to view the astronaut's journey as being metaphorical more than literal  'The Fountain' is similar to '2001' in at least one way: both films were bold and daring enough to stray from the mainstream, from what audiences are used to; time, I predict, will be very kind to this film.",8.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"

The best movie that no one will watch.,"Disclaimer: This movie is NOT for everyone. If you are looking for a movie to ""zone out to"" (which is fine), do NOT go see this. If you want a movie that makes you think and question life, death, and the journey for solace days after seeing it, then go see The Fountain. In terms of visuals, it's absolutely stunning (cinematography, lighting, special effects) and in color tone, is the polar opposite to Requiem For A Dream (RFAD was cold blues and grays, TF is all warm amber glows). The special effects enhance the story instead of compensating for a lack thereof. For a movie with relatively so little dialog, the acting is universally spot on, and Rachel Weisz should be recognized for Best Supporting Actress (even though she won't be). Her ""bed scene"" was absolutely heart-wrenching and yet gloriously strong in depicting her character's acceptance of the situation around her. You'll sit through the first 15-20 minutes wondering where the hell it's going, but once you're ""in"", it becomes absolutely rapturous. It's very rare that a movie actually reaches the ""hype"" and ""concept"" presented in the trailers. IMO, Darren Aronofsky has succeeded and created an amazing film that won't be appreciated by all, but will be cherished by those that do. Let's just hope we won't have to wait so long for him and his next project.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
Supersaturated Hyperrealism,"The popular media reviews could not have been more wrong on this movie. This one is a gem. It reminded me first of Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey, except here, Aronofsky seems to have dedicated himself to some supersaturated form of hyper-realism. The entire conceptual draw of time in this movie forms a sort of multilinear canopy over some strange scaldic fluid. It's amazing how seamlessly this occurs. The past, the future, the present, all possess a strong sense of dislocation from the ordinary; which is to say, ""which present could this possibly be?"" It feels as though you're floating through the abstract debris of a consciousness unfolding about itself, only to find that its location spans four dimensions.The heart of the film is a mediation on death, love, time, and the relationship of these phenomena to genesis and life. A wholly apropos treatment, in a day and age when the biological sciences name immortality as the ""magic bullet"" that they so desperately are seeking. Aronofsky appeals to these sensibilities on enormously subtle and yet deeply profound levels. He seems to want to raise the question, what is life? Does it have meaning without death? And perhaps most importantly, is this endless struggle for immortality really nothing but an almost adolescent misunderstanding of the very nature and meaning of life, to begin with?",9.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
"Aranofsky's Piece is Gorgeous, but Selective","The Fountain is the essence of film, it not only evokes emotions but it compels you to pay attention and learn. You can't say that about any other film. However, despite how good this film truly is, 8 out of 10 people will walk away perplexed, annoyed, or generally unhappy. This is because America is truly not meant for a film this complex. This is terrible, because The Fountain just leaks awe inspiring imagery. The Fountain will be hard to crack for most people, and the odds of it turning a profit is ludicrous. However, despite these things, this film is truly an alternative minded success in my mind, and I believe anyone with a brain in their head and an open mind will love The Fountain.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
Cosmic Mumbo Jumbo,"The Fountain is a weird and disappointing mess. The film is incoherent and confusing and it's a shame because U.S. movies should be more adventurous and experimental, but I came away with no clear idea what the film was about. Although, Jackman's strange, intense performance did make me laugh.There are three intertwined story lines and the film weaves in-and-out,back-and-forward in time and space. Hugh Jackman plays two characters: Tomas, a 16th century Spanish conquistador, and Tommy Creo, a present day scientist. Both are humorless, driven, unsympathetic obsessives who seek immortality to protect the women in their lives. The lovely Rachel Weisz plays Queen Isabella of Spain, who is under threat from the inquisition. Adam and Eve were exiled from the Garden of Eden to prevent them from eating from the Tree of Life and achieving immortality. Isabella sends Tomas to South America to find the Tree which is located on top of a Mayan temple. On contact Tomas turns into a plant.Centuries later, Isabel (also Weisz) is dying and her husband, Tommy (a scientist), tries to find a cure for cancer to save her life. Later, Tommy loses his hair and spends eternity floating around far flung galaxies seated in the lotus position. He looks like a Buddhist monk or Hare Krishna devotee and talks to a tree on a barren asteroid. The tree could be Isabel, but we don't find out if the tree talks back to him.Jackman plays a man on the verge of a nervous breakdown, he is very angry and obsessed . Weisz looked beautiful and radiant but seemed to belong in another movie. The Fountain obviously has intellectual pretensions but literal interpretations of the Book of Genesis are out of fashion and speculation on the Biblical notion of immortality seem somewhat irrelevant. I originally assumed the director must have a real vision and something important to say given the work involved in making this ""epic"". But the film's ideas seemed more like pretentious mumbo jumbo made under the influence of hallucinogenic drugs.",3.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
"This film depicts the interconnectedness of life in a manner that combines drama, love, possibilities, and impossibilities.","I agree with another reviewer that this is unlike any film I have ever seen before. It is beautifully crafted, acted with award-winning performances, and is visually stunning in many scenes. The scenes are tied together with creative transitions that move us between various time periods, as if we were weaving in and out of traffic on a busy highway. ""The Fountain"" is a masterpiece--one I intend to own once it's available, and I am not a movie purchaser. I look forward to future viewings in order to appreciate all the nuances I could not take in from my first viewing. ""The Fountain"" is a keeper, a film to cherish, a reminder of what and who we are.

A masterpiece.,"Darren Aronofsky's surreal head trip into everlasting life and love is a real head turner and a modern masterpiece with floating bubbles and Spanish conquistadors but what makes it worth while is the amazing chemistry of Rachel Weisz and Hugh Jackman. Both give great performances that make the movie the great film it is, even though the story goes far out there at times. Their passion is the reason you go for this film and what passion it is. Their scenes are nothing short of perfect and they are the real reason this film works on its indented levels. Their story is touching and extremely moving. You end up feeling their joys and sorrows and in the end, are unlighted by their discovery are well.It's out there but thanks to Weisz and Jackman, the space trip is worth it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
"Deep, thorough, and Emmensly complex philosophical love story","In short, this is a VERY involved, very serious film. It's difficult to understand, and may appear to be silly to those who do not understand it.That being said, I'd like to mention that it's the best film I've experienced in my lifetime (I'm a movie guy). It encompasses many themes and includes a number of recurring symbols and concepts. Note that one who does not follow these will not make the connections necessary to understand the plot. Kudos to Aronofsky's genius.Aside from the film making aspects, The Fountain is a very emotional movie. At several points in the film the audience is struck hard with grief. Many cry at a multitude of points (at the end, I hear a few crying in the theater). The will of the movie to convey emotion is very impressive, and relentless. Those who have experienced Requiem for a Dream and/or Pi will find it much less intense, as a welcome relief, but much more crushing.The Fountain, all in all, is a wonderful film to watch. Whether or not you will understand it is trivial, however with the effort made one will find it to be awe-inspiring (I couldn't speak a full sentence for a few minutes after the incredible ending sequence) and downright amazing.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
A Slog To Get Through,"I feel like on paper, this is a film I should love.

For all intents and purposes, if done well, this movie should be a reflective home run.I *should* love this film...but I don't.The problem is, the film tries too hard to come across as deep. It spends most of its time trying to look and sound deep, everything from the monologues, the rhyming camera-work, and the vague intonations of deeper unsaid dialogue are all..well, just conceited.There is no through line, no conclusion, and what we see on screen is all flash without any actual substance.

The definition of art,"There are some movies you can't stop thinking about it after seeing them. ""The fountain"" is certainly one of them.

Do you understand everything when you look at abstract art? No, but it can be beautiful anyway. That's what happen with ""The Fountain"". Art is not about understanding, it's about feeling. And what a feeling this movie leaves you! This movie is unique and will be a precursor of a new genre, like ""2001 : A space odyssey"" was. That's why it's criticized a lot, cause a lot of people are not ready for this kind of movie, but I'm sure in 10,20 or 30 years it will be a classic. We'll still talk about the plot, try to understand it, have new theories, like we're still arguing about if Deckard is a replicant or not in ""Blade Runner"".

I'm still trying to figure out what this film was about.  All I know is that I should waste my time.,"I recently saw this film at a preview screening at Warner Bros. Studios. I don't know how a film like this can get made. Although I've heard it called by someone, ""the best film I've ever seen"", I couldn't disagree more. I believe it to be one of the worst films, not only of the year, but also of all time. The story of this film is so mutled, baffling, and incoherent that only a true fan of 2001: A Space Odyssey and Zardoz could appreciate it. Every scene is totally random and out of context with no structure. We see a man in the jungle, a doctor operating on monkeys, and a monk floating around space in a snow-globe (which I later found out by reading a quote from the director was suppose to be an astronaut 600 years from now (I couldn't understand that after watching the entire film)). Many films, like The Fountain, try to trick the audience into believing that they hold some kind of intellectual insight, when in reality they are a series of random and uninsightful images based around a loose concept. No one can understand The Fountain. It's beyond comprehension. The screenplay for this film is simply atrocious. The characters appear randomly without context and have no development whatsoever. Although the running time of this film isn't very long, it seems like an eternity that I'll never get back. Director Aronofsky has made some of the worst films I've ever seen and he still somehow finds a way to outdo himself with ever new attempt. Don't get dooped into believe that this film holds some deeper meaning. It you did, you'd spend an eternity trying to find that meaning and would never be able to. This fountain only a mere puddle that will soon evaporate away.",1.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
"Filled with silly, pretentious, artsy metaphysics and loved every minute of it","I can understand why a large number of people would not like this movie. This movie is not escapism, which turns many people away. There is nothing wrong with escapism: after working or studying all week many people just want rest their brain for 2 hours on the weekend, and escape from seriousness. This film takes itself seriously, but because it isn't merely a character drama or a political film, people find it pretentious. Finally, the movie is filled with religious, philosophical, and holistic symbolism, which may come off as silly to some. If you think those points I mentioned would not detract you from seeing this film, then keep reading. This IS one of the better Science Fiction films since ""2001"", mainly because it thinks beyond telling a simple hero story with gadgets. While it does have a bit of neuroscience and astronomy laced in there, the themes are more about philosophy's biggest questions, and it does not ask them in a simple or patronizing way. The acting is also very powerful from both leads, the visual effects are gorgeous, and the music is great. I also don't think those who call it a jumbled mess are giving it a valid critique: like Kubrick, Aronofsky uses an unconventional narrative structure to give the themes more coherence than the story, and does this with skillful technique much like ""2001"" or ""Eyes Wide Shut"". I have never seen ""Pi"" or ""Requiem for a Dream"", so I really can't compare it to his previous works. I will say that I came out of the movie struck by its beauty and emotion, and dwelled on its intellect for days. This is one of my favorites, and I will definitely be seeing this one quite a few more times.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
What film-making should be striving for...,"The Fountain has been a movie many, including myself, have been greatly anticipating and hyping for the past 3 years. Both of Darren Aronofsky's previous films have been indicative of real talent. With Pi showing a nack for thought provoking subject matter, and depending on the viewer, a profound or pretentious nature... I found it profound. Requiem for a Dream proved he could pull of a very compositionally, and stylistically sound film, and also really get our guts churning. The story was fairly simplistic(which isn't exactly a fault in itself), but the characters, cinematography, and acting really made up for this in spades. Therein lies the buildup for his newest film. Being a proved talent with two great features under his belt, he announced his biggest project yet, ""The Fountain."" My personal reaction to first reading the synopsis three years ago on IMDb were both of excitement and of reservation, was he being too ambitious? Finally, after 3 years in the making, and much trouble production side, the movie is finished... does it succeed? My answer is a resounding... YES! I am of the personal opinion that 2001: A Space Odyssey is one of the greatest films ever made. Its heavy reliance on visual storytelling, and sheer ability to spark the imagination captured me through repeated viewings. In much the same way, The Fountain has captured me. I have only seen it once, so this review may reflect a very sudden, and rash view on it, but a day after the fact my mind is still mulling over the movie's subtleties.When first starting out, the movie didn't exactly woo me right away... The Conquistador portions leading into a space exploration portion. The Zen Buddhist imagery was interesting, but came off kind of cheesy at first. I kept watching... I allowed it to unfurl before my eyes, and was left with a most satisfying conclusion. Yes, this movie requires one to think, yes this movie isn't straightforward... But it isn't pretentious. I have read in other places that this movie requires one to look into themselves to make sense of it all, and I agree. I connected fully. Now, I will take into account that not everyone will, and while saddened at the idea, I accept this. So, much in the vein of 2001: A Space Odyssey, this movie comes along and captures the imagination, and the mind, and unlike 2001, it also captures the heart. Both Rachel Weisz and Hugh Jackman put in wonderful, and emotionally charged performances. Also arguably unlike 2001's ""trip-out"" scene, I felt that The Fountain had more easily understandable visual imagery, and those who are detracting it for being nonsense, are really missing the point. I urge everyone to see it, but they should know before going in that it may not be for them.Also, even afterward the Zen Buddhist imagery was kind of cheesy, but it served a purpose which made much more sense later on.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
Bautiful Imagery holds a Beautiful Story stronger.,"Some of the most beautiful imagery is brought together with an endearing story, that sums up the epitome of an ideally inspirational love tale. Written and Directed by the masterful Harvard graduate, Darren Aronofsky, The Fountain spans across three different time periods, with reoccurring theme of love and eternal life. This blossoming film becomes more and more entrancing as it continues to go back and forth between the three lover's, doomed to meet the same fate by the end of the film. Hugh Jackman plays all three male protagonists, while the ever-so gentle Rachel Weisz plays all three of the lovers. The third story, which takes place in the future, is the more complicated, and what will no undoubtedly drive most cinema goers away from this masterpiece. Set in the future, of which time we are not privy to, the third segment takes place in space and takes us along for a journey to a dying nebula. After many problems behind the scenes of this film, Aronofsky finally completed The Fountain and this futuristic segment without the help of modern computer graphics. Able to withstand the test of time, The Fountain will definitely achieve a larger following when released to digital video.Accompanying Aronofsky in this endeavor comes long standing friend and musician Clint Mansell, who decided to work with the brilliantly epic Scottish band Mogwai, on this progressively haunting theme. Although the film has a short running time, of only 96 minutes, Aronofsky and his crew live up to their last two films. The Fountain is nothing like his last two movies, which used hip-hop sounds and fast-cut editing in a music video style. In this epic, Aronofsky uses more traditional style camera work, and allot of overhead shots, simulating satellite photography up-close. Unfortunately, The Fountains release will most likely go unnoticed whilst in theaters proving once again that Hollywood's better films usually tread far under the radar, until Oscar season.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"

A man's thousand-year quest to save the woman he loves.,"The Fountain is a good example of why, I think, Darren Aronofsky is one of the best directors working in Hollywood today. I guess it was something of a pet project of his. The film doesn't have a clear narrative. Instead it features three stories that tackle the themes of life and death. Russian and Asian influences are evident in these stories. The special effects are spectacular, but the film's greatest strength is the acting. Both Hugh Jackman and Rachel Weisz provide excellent performances. The Fountain is an unusual film so it's not meant to be entertaining. Still, it's an absorbing fantasy drama that shows what cinema is capable of nowadays. Some of the film's scenes are simply stunning. Love is rarely portrayed this well on the big screen. The Fountain already has a cult following because it's one of the most daring films of recent years. I'm thinking that film buffs will enjoy it more than the average moviegoer. I highly recommend The Fountain.",8.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
The Fountain Is Truly A Masterpiece,"Pi was very deep. With twists and turns and a very interesting message about spirituality, organized religion and the inner workings of the human mind. Shot intensely and with the flair of an artist, it was great.Requiem For A Dream descended us into the pure nightmare of addiction in all its forms. Drugs, love, attention. Aronofsky's vision highlighted many things wrong with our instant gratification society but with a visually innovative style that was unprecedented. His use of editing and visual/story suspense are unmatched. I remember sitting in the theater when this film ended and never before seeing an entire audience not move. Stunned and what they had just witnessed then rise up, one by one disoriented and moved, exiting the screening room. That is the power only a true artist wields.Now, with the Fountain, Aronofsky's progression as a filmmaker and as an artist have taken the next evolutionary step. This film has too many layers to fully digest with simply one viewing. From the first few frames down to the last few, you're imagination and intellect are engaged and running at top speed to keep up with his constant in-references, visual clues and allegory. This work is simply a masterpiece. A true film fan's thanksgiving feast fusing the concepts of pure love, spiritual folklore, life & death, science and suspense and the very nature of creation. It will hopefully take me another two screenings to fully comprehend everything I saw last night but I haven't looked forward to re-watching a film as much since The Sixth Sense and The Usual Suspects.His use of color, editing, audio cues and dynamic performances elevate this tale from the story of one man's undying love for his dying wife into a metaphysical, time-bending metaphor for life itself. Most people won't get this film but I think that's a good thing. It doesn't pander and it doesn't give up one inch of artistic integrity for mass appeal.It is a true work of art.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"

Be Prepared To Think!,"If you're going to watch The Fountain, I must caution viewers that this is one of those films that require some semblance of a brain due to the complexity of this film. People didn't like this film precisely because they did not want to think. However, I found this film fascinating because of the story that is rich in underlying themes about eternal love. This film not only boasts a well-made and rather controversial storyline, it's visually striking and features some amazing visuals to look at. Just looking at the end credits will say it all.Darren Aronofsky's film has one complicated plot that spans centuries and millennia and talks about the past, present, and future. There are story lines revolving around a guy named Tom who's looking for a cure for his dying wife, a guy named Tomas Verdes who is looking for the Tree of Life, and a space traveler who hallucinates his lost love.Hugh Jackman delivers one of his career-best performance as he plays these multiple characters. He sheds away his X-Men persona and gives a heartfelt, emotional, and raw performance. A performance we have not seen from him before. Rachel Weisz does a very good job as well.Overall, if you're able to close your eyes and use your brain, you'll more likely to find this film fantastic. I loved how this film drew parallels from the past through future while looking for the meaning of life and what one takes to be in love. There are several biblical references here and that makes the journey even more spiritual. A fantastic and a vastly underrated movie to behold. I rate this film 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"

Maybe tonight, or at the very latest Sunday.I can't remember the last time I shed tears in a movie theater. The visuals, combined with the themes of hope, loss & redemption, were almost overwhelming.

Don't look too much for answers, as you sometimes have to put together your own.The visual effects are stunning and,don't betray the ""lowish"" budget of $30 million this cost to make. They're done with some old-fashioned methods, fluid chamber work, model work and a dash of CG. The result is poetic and amazing.It's kind of like 2001: A Space Odyssey, of this time though,and even then that film asked viewers a lot, rather than provide easy answers.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
Overly abstract and metaphorically heavy-handed.,"Rather than bothering with creating a story around which to establish his themes, Aronofsky has instead chosen to ignore character and instead layer metaphor upon metaphor in what becomes a muddled illustration of the path to immortality through the embracing of death. Instead of leaving the film with a clear concept of the director's intent, the viewer is left confused by the film's mix of Buddhism, Mayan creation myth, Christian creation myth, its three interwoven and only vaguely defined plots, and myriad unresolved subplots. Hugh Jackman and Rachel Weisz give solid performances considering the material they are dealing with, but the film's cartoonish depiction of the Mayans as bloodthirsty savages is, frankly, offensive. While the film is at times visually stunning, its self-importance and lack of coherence makes for an unsatisfying experience.",1.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
An unexpected lightness of being ...,"I made a last second decision to see this film instead of the film I had scheduled for myself (""Flags of Our Fathers""), as its starting time afforded me extra time in the co-resident shopping mall to locate a present for my Sweety. I located the present I was seeking and found another, ""The Fountain,"" which I also hope to share with Sweety before it leaves our theater market, likely as it is all too quickly to be replaced by a popular holiday blockbuster.In short, the trailer I had seen on TV did not nearly do justice to this film. It showed what seems to be a superficial and fantastic tale, with wooden and emotionless dialog (sampling, as it does, some of the universally quieter pronouncements of its actors). And the sampled visuals make it seem almost like a sophisticated, but empty, CGI animation.In reality, the film is a sublimely timeless, visual and aural poem, a meditation on life and death, and on human acceptance of both. It presents a three-part story, layered in both time and space across what appear to be several thousand years, beginning in the 15th century. As such, the three parts proceed as one, with a deft inter-cutting from one to another, not always in a consistent sequence, but in a sequence that reveals more and more about each part as the movie progresses.The central tale passes circa the present day, where a research doctor (Hugh Jackman, as Tom Creo) is seeking a cure for cancer. His wife (Rachel Weisz, as Izzi Creo) is also ill, a major cause for Dr. Creo's urgent intensity. And the story unfolds in past, present, and future as both an epic reflection on the nature of good and evil, and the most fundamental struggle for meaning in mundane matters of life and death. The entire film is suffused with a powerful musical score from beginning to end, played almost entirely by the Kronos String Quartet, and which perfectly matches the visual poetry unfolding.The principals appear in each part of time and space as different people on similar missions designed to solve their respective and timely problems of existence, yet, somehow, as the same people throughout, almost reincarnated. Jackman's Tomas/Tom/Tommy represents the single most consistent character, really the ""I"" of the multi-layered story. His character seems to answer the question posed by the trailer: what might it really mean for one to find the secret of eternal life? And the secret of the answer seems to lie in the reality of a universe in which death, paradoxically, is an integral part of eternal life.The bigger questions, which might otherwise drift as if in a drug-induced haze, instead stand in a bold relief set off by the intensely emotional relationship between Tom and Izzi. Weisz's Izzi is as intense as Jackman's Tom, but she boils with a passion that is as precocious at finding final peace as is Tom's relentless seeking for eternal life. And the course of his and her struggle seems to nail the weight of these larger questions to some unseen cross, of which we glimpse only the slightest allusions. Ultimately, only the most necessary requirements for life survive to support the ultimate end, our own imagined, or rather Tom's, destiny. And, yes, love is also at both the beginning and the end.All of the acting and cast is superb, and the roll of midwife to the birthing of both Tom's and Izzi's difficult destiny receives a splendid performance from Ellen Burstyn.In sum, this movie comes the closest of any film I have seen to creating a contemporary cinematic mandala. If it works, and I think it does so nobly, it is, like a mandala, the symbol in which each of us finds something of our own reflected life, and that of the hopeful, yet deeply troubled, world around us.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
Pretentious psycho-spiritualbabble for us Western dummies,"Overbearingly ambitious metaphysical yarn was one of those projects passed around and restructured around different actors a few times and unfortunately, it shows. Darren Aronofsky's long awaited follow up to his break-thru smash Requiem for a Dream may have noble intentions but has second rate written all over. In his undercooked and convoluted script, Aronofsky will proceed to beat viewers over the head with themes on death and rebirth in so many ways. Three different scenarios, all centering around the underdeveloped love story, weave within one another in a way I'm sure will remain appealing to the young demographic it will reluctantly take on, but feels embarrassingly trite for the demographic thought to be in mind.Let's start with The Fountain's appropriation of a much stressed spiritual context. In what was supposed to feel like allegory for the soul's evolution instead is butchered into three convoluted narratives which do little to exemplify the material at hand. For the most part, scenes in The Fountain have the unfortunate air of a thrift-store film, one can absolutely sense a middle-ground compromise that tarnishes any authenticity the film had going for itself.All of Aronofsky's cinematic trickery (and even a few sublimely framed shots) cannot rescue The Fountain from drying up. Hugh Jackman and Rachel Weisz aren't the worst overpaid actors around, though what they bring to this vision stays superficially deep. Unable to master dynamics needed to lend the epic pull this movie posits, Jackman and especially Weisz turn in disappointingly unimportant, selfish performances. It all adds up to little more then a time traveling soap opera with some shiny eye candy thrown in. Viewers may enjoy piecing fragments together in order to gaze upon a naive vision in all it's splendor, but most wiser enough to feel a stinging pandering to ones sense of soul will achieve little resonant redemption for following this through. It's heart may completely be in the right place, and for that we will still hold hope for Mr. Aronfsky in future endeavors, but unfortunately I must declare the film an undeniable failure in any greatness it seeks.",5.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
A film about Humanity's obsession and rejection of Death,"Last night I saw the Chicago International Film Festival premiere of Aronofsky's ""The Fountain"", and I have to say, this is not only the best of Aronofsky's films, it is easily the best film I have seen in the last few years. In my opinion, the film is a trip through the obsession, and rejection, that Humanity has for the concept of death.I actually walked in not knowing what to expect, I even had forgotten I was going to see an Aronofsky film, even though I have enjoyed his previous films. I realized who the director was before the film only because he was there to present his work.The first and biggest word of advice for anyone about to watch this film, especially fans of Aronofsky's work, is that you are NOT going to see Requiem for a Dream part II, nor anything resembling the director's previous work. I haven't seen the previews, but my second word of advice is: try to avoid them! This film has to be seen with a completely open mind.Having said that, keep in mind that this film is not for everyone. It is a true art film that requires from the audience to meet it halfway in order to connect with the ideas the director is trying to convey. It is visually stunning, but the images are more than just eye candy. They have a very profound meaning behind them. But what meanings and ideas you will carry with you after the film is over will depend on whether you can ""connect"" with Aronofsky's conceptual images.Jackman and Weisz performances are very contrasting and Oscar-worthy, with Jackman's being especially intense. His character reminds me of the obsessiveness in Sean Gullette's character in ""Pi"", and that is probably the only connection you will find with that film. Some might even find it a bit over the top, but in my opinion, it is absolutely required for the subject of the story in this film, and Jackman delivers with credibility.Here's hoping that Aronofsky gets a well-deserved Oscar nomination for this film!",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
The problem is the answer,"You don't get all the answers in/to this life, the best one can hope for is to create art that lifts the veil. This film needs no answer to qualify it's existence. Good art works when the viewer no longer ""sees"" the art. But is transported from the physical to to the vision. I am amazed and awed by this film's ability to lift the veil. Beyond the directing, great music, acting, sets and editing lies a dream of what life/death are/could be/might be. One can pick it apart to to try to locate the keys to the doors of reality but it won't help in the end. The lack of linear thought and plot progression is not meant to confuse but to enlighten ones perspective. The answer is the problem and the problem is the answer.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
I saw a remarkable movie this weekend,"I saw a remarkable movie this weekend. It was really good but half of the people that see it won't get it, and they'll hate it and talk about how it sucked and was confusing and how they wish they could get back that two hours. I heard all about it at the urinal in the movie theater before I left.Me? I'll be over in the other crowd talking about how some movies don't connect all dots, that sometimes the canvas is meant to contain your own perceptions of what you saw and how it worked. I could also be talking about a mirror as canvas and how it contains different images for everyone. That is one of the incredible things about the movie...that when its over, your take on it is different than anyone elses (although mine's pretty close to Harry Knowles' take over on Ain't It Cool News). I loved it and wished it hadn't ever ended and how it is both gloriously beautiful and very familiar.In The Fountain, there are three stories revealing themselves gradually. There is a Spanish Conquistador, asked by his queen to seek a mystery. There is a modern man who is looking to save his wife, dying of cancer. And last, there is the same man, far flung in the future, performing t'ai chi sequences in a bubble beside a tree in far away space. Oh yes, and there is the glorious Rachel Weisz. Trust me...Rick O'Connell's love for Evelyn in The Mummy movies is NOTHING compared to Hugh Jackman's adoration for his wife here.How are they connected? What do they have in common? Is it worth the 2 hours you're going to spend going somewhere with these characters? Oh yes, clearly. Although half of you will think it sucks and half of you will see brilliance.I'm still dazzled....great movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
Aronofsky is such a funny guy,"I'll give this two stars for the beautiful set and the fact that there was actual effort involved, and one star for the fact that it is unique in presentation. However, this is one of the most unwatchable things I've ever seen.""Daronofsky"" has a pretty poor track record at this point. His first flick, ""Pi"", seemed watchable when I was a young, easily influenced, angsty teenager. Looking back on it today, even that film does not hold up so well, as Aronofsky movies parade style over substance while being totally oblivious to the fact.The next flick he did, ""Requiem For a Dream"" (featuring Jennifer Connelly, yowza!) was the most glorified, pretentious movie about drug addiction put to film. I always knew drugs were bad (eh heh heh...) but I never knew they could be so stylish! His film editing in his first two films is like MTV-meets-Tarantino except without the ""Gilmore Girls""-on-steroids writing found in the latter. On the surface, his movies appear to be about profound things (Kabbalistic math, drug addiction, death and spirituality, Jennifer Connelly) but then you realize that he has nothing to say on these subjects. He just keeps flashing subject-related images with minimal, cryptic dialog and melancholic or ominous music. What sorcery!Which brings us to ""The Fountain"" a film purportedly abandoned by production companies and so forth because they thought it was too risky. I think their assessment was still rather generous. I think it's just plain bad. Here, for the third time, Aronofsky has proved himself to be an exclusively aesthetic director.It's strange -- Aronofsky doesn't seem to understand that people have covered the same tragic/epic themes in better movies that also contained developed plots and characters. Someone here argued that the main characters are archetypes of the human experience. Whatever. I would say the same thing about the characters in Takashi Miike's ""Izo"" (also unwatchable but much more complete in its grasp) or ""Children of Paradise"", a film in which the characters manage to be simultaneously ridiculous, endearing and exaggerated and yet totally human. Children of Paradise is a masterful meditation on love and, unlike this one, has a sense of HUMOR. Considering the lack of jokes in his movies, I am convinced that Aronofsky is not only unprofound, but also a spiritual STATUE.An example of the ridiculous pomp in this film: for some reason, Hugh Jackman randomly does Yoga and Taijiquan (Tai Chi) for brief segments. What relevance does this have to the grand human experience? Seriously, what of it? This is only relevant to people (like Aronofsky) who don't actually know anything about Yoga or Tai Chi. People who actually practice these things wouldn't advertise them as the pinnacle of human achievement in a movie about love.""The Fountain"" wants to be profound so very badly and yet just reeks of New Age yuppie pretense. You can critique anything and commend its artistic credibility and symbolism because: hind-sight is always 20-20! If you really thought this was deep, you just might be a New-Age yuppie. It's basically up there with ""Mindwalk"", ""What the &($% Do We Know?"" and any of the aforementioned films Aronofsky has done.Proof that Aronofsky is no great writing/directing talent? He has no sense of humor. He should direct other scripts and stories. Then he might have something.",3.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
"Insightful, attractive, and stunning","Probably the best film of the year. Thought-provoking, enigmatic, and insightful, it provides great spiritual and physical outlooks into our existence and inevitable death. The visuals are beautiful, although at times, the lack of lighting in some scenes is somewhat aggravating. Regardless, the story that takes place in the 1600's is particularly interesting, and is quite beautiful. Like previously stated, this movie is not for everyone; it requires thought and begs to be interpreted differently for each individual. If you bought the Collector's DVD Edition of ""Road Trip"" and went to see ""Jackass 2"" with your buds and their girlfriends who don't even know you, this film probably isn't for you.Regardless, this is a film to be remembered for years, although it's sketchy topics and uncommon directing techniques may make it difficult to fully embrace by some.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
A confused and pretentious celebration of death,"Despite some excellent acting performances from the lead caste and some imaginative special effects this movie cannot escape its flawed confused and occasionally disgusting philosophical message. The pace of the film varies from slow to a full stop. The director, who also wrote the script, provides a jigsaw puzzle of pieces that he is irritatingly slow to develop into a meaningful narrative. Once we discover the central thesis we find that it is a celebration of the spiritually fulfilling nature of death. The scientist lead is portrayed as emotional and self-indulgent in his desire to come up with a cure for a fatal disease. His potential for success in developing a life saving remedy is portrayed as a foolish failure to understand the spiritual significance of a fulfilling death. This film was surprisingly antilife and truly dreadful. Its most satisfying feature was the fact that we shared the theatre with only two other couples. Clealry word has gotten out. I was severely disappointed with the IMDb rating which persuaded me to part with money for this offensive rubbish. One to avoid.",2.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
"Great, thought-provoking film","Thank goodness for such an innovative, interesting experience like ""The Fountain."" I just saw it at the Chicago Film Festival, and I thought it was brilliant.

I do hope that people see it.It is SO refreshing to see a film that one cannot ""figure out"" for a few hours after seeing it. Not all questions NEED to be answered in a film, and people who understand that should appreciate this film. The aesthetics are amazing, and plot aside, The Fountain is a completely ""rich"" experience.

When Poetry meets Cinema,"When i first watched the film, i considered it as a very good movie. The second time i loved it and the third time i felt like dying. I stuck, the words are few and cheap and always not enough to describe how i felt. The movie is a real poetry. It is so lyric, full of emotions. The photography, the music, the direction, the acting, the story everything combined in a excellent result. It is a magic film, i felt like living in a dream, a wonderful dream that wouldn't like to end. It is a journey to love, to life, to death and to emotions. I felt so power and weak at the same time. I felt like i want to live forever and die at the same time. Hugh and Rachel are extremely good. I cried so many times, i felt relief. Their faces, their acting their voices were magnificent. This is not a review of the film but it is my personal trip to it. Definitely one of my best movies ever.

Like nothing you've ever seen before.,"What an original movie that was deep and imaginative. This is not your average brain-dead herd 'em in like cattle Hollywood movie that leaves you feeling empty and shortchanged. This movie is full of stunning visuals & mind-blowing sci-fi images, brilliant acting & music, and well, wow, it was a pretty wild ride. I don't know quite how to describe it because I have never seen a movie quite like this one. Hugh Jackman gave an Oscar winning performance. I mean, his acting was INCREDIBLE in this movie and he should win best actor in 2006, for sure. Rachel Weisz (I Love her) was also very good, but the movie focused more on Hugh Jackman's character. The movie, for me, was kind of like a timeless epic journey of a man and a woman and their sacred bond of true love and marriage, life and death, the past, the present, and the future, and the struggle not just to cope with death, but a race to overcome it through science and meditation. It's definitely not a kid flick - leave them at home - they might like the visuals but they won't understand the movie at all really. Heck, I'm not even sure I fully understand the movie. It's definitely a film for a more mature audience. If you like a good epic tragic love-story full of symbolism and sci-fi, then you'll love this film. If you're like me, you'll want to watch it a few times on DVD to really ""get it"" since it was so deep on many levels.

"""The Fountain"" is too confusing!","Everyone has a right to their opinions of course but for the life of me, I can't understand all the enthusiastic reviews this movie has received on here. I love sci-fi adventures, enjoy a good romance and don't mind having to actually use my brain to help figure out the twists and turns of a good movie but....""The Fountain"" was way ""too far out there"" for me!First the good news: ""The Fountain"" is a romance, sci-fi and action/adventure movie all rolled into one! Now the bad news: ""The Fountain"" doesn't do any of these very well. More good news: the cinematography (A+), costumes (B+) and acting (B) are all pretty good and deserve high grades. Unfortunately, I thought the biggest drawback of this movie was, very simply, the screenplay (D). It was way too confusing for me, my date (and we are actually rather intelligent people!) and it seemed, most of the viewing audience. When the movie ended, we all seemed to look at each other with a confused look on our face, shrug our shoulders and say ""What the heck was that about?""I followed the general gist of the plot...(without giving away too much info)... Man searches for The Fountain of Youth throughout time and space to try to preserve his and his love's life. OK, easy enough but was the whole story really happening or was it only his reading of his wife's novel? And as I was debating this in my mind I realized one important thing...that I didn't really care. The story never grabbed me, sucked me into its characters and into its life. It never made me care.And the final straw for me and my sweety was this...what the heck was with ""Hugh-Jackman-in-the-future"" floating in that stupid bubble??

A different look,"I truly enjoyed this film. I told my brother after watching, ""If you don't get it the first time through, watch it a second time."". It's an awkward story telling, especially since most people are used to a linear perspective. One plot for one movie. Some suggest this movie is about the past, present, and future. I think they are wrong. I believe this is more about three uniquely different ways to explain one concept. Two plots are metaphors, and the one is the basis for the others. All three stories tell a different side to both main characters. Take a step back during this movie. It's a lot to take in. So I suggest you sit and watch. Follow but don't try to make assumptions. Let your mind just take it in. When your finished. Think about what you just saw...still confused, then give it just one more try. It's deserving of it.

Is there more power in something that leaves you thinking, I believe so. I am a visual artist myself and in that respect this is what a artist can do with a movie.

spoilers and just my thoughts/reflection/opinion,"I perceive the movie as 1/4 Traditional Literature>Religious Stories and 3/4 Fantasy. Image- pleasing and audio-amazing, I honestly watched half the movie either nodding in agreement to choice of direction or with jaw loose and hand covering, wanting to smile the largest grin ever. I asked Jake a couple of things that he liked about the movie and they didn't exactly coincide with what I liked, showing that I just want to see it again. I don't often get that feeling. The moment that Izzy dies and so does the tree of life was a jaw loosener. And every frame from that point forward was also quite amazing. I found it beautiful in its religious text and also mysterious in its curious beginning and first half. It's funny that I watched Deja Vu right before this movie and it was more about time travel, but as I was considering it more, I felt like this movie was more like space travel. It was unique in its aspects of integrating about three stories into one. More. His choice in the second instance when she leaves to take a first-snow walk and following her, to me, shows that he was ready to be with Eve and forget his life and live the eternal life. In my eyes, when he saw the tree the second time, in the past life, it was the honest tree of eternal life as opposed to the tree of life. Eternity. She just wanted him to finish it, and in a way, I suppose he did but in a really far off way... but not really. Dang. OK, so that side story and him versus that human beast and that beast praising him after he has realized his greed and the sap and his longing. I am blabbing. She was ready and in a way I think he was trying to convince himself too early or just realized too late that he was ready to join her too. The deliverance of the new scientific revelation was the mayan death that just brought life to a whole concept of new birth where he can finally rest. I feel that she was way ahead of him, despite her sickness. The power each had, however, was one that I sensed they had for themselves(character) and not necessarily for the moviescreen.

Living with Grace,"The opening sequences of ""The Fountain"" are disorienting, even having a clue about the movie. In one scene Hugh Jackman is conquistador Tomas battling fierce warriors before a Mayan temple in the service of his Queen Isabel (Rachel Weisz). In the next, Jackman is Tom Creo traveling in a spherical globe to a distant nebula in 2500 A.D. with what looks like the remains of a tree. My clarity comes from having seen the entire movie. Director and Screenwriter Darren Aronofsky is bold and daring in ""The Fountain"". Though flawed, Arononfsky's ""The Fountain"" needs to be acknowledged for its ambition and nobility. ""The Fountain"" is worthy of view and thought as perhaps one of the year's best. Granted the movie is not for everyone. On the surface ""The Fountain"" is about the search for eternal life. As poignantly pleaded by Tommy (Jackman) in the present day, he wishes to ""stop dying (death)"". ""The Fountain"" is a reference to the Fountain of Youth. From Genesis, when Adam and Eve were banished from the Garden of Eden after tasting from the Tree of Knowledge, the Tree of Life was forfeited and lost forever. Or perhaps it was not.I believe that Aronofsky is really interested in coming to terms with one's mortality and making peace with that. In the present story setting Izzy Creo (Weisz) says to Tommy (Jackman) that ""In death there is creation."" Hers is the romantic conceit. With powerful performances from Jackman and Weisz, ""The Fountain"" is about eternal love, without attachment and acceptance of fate. What resonates for me is that in the end ""The Fountain"" ultimately is about one's life being whole and complete. In Aronfsky's and Ari Handel's story ""The Fountain"" is a story within the movie, set in New Spain of 1500 A.D. written by Izzy. The dying Izzy tells her husband Tommy, ""Finish it."" He replies, ""I don't know how it ends."" Izzy has made her peace, but Tommy can't let go. Aronofsky touchingly asks: How does life end? ""The Fountain"" has one of the most bizarre narratives of any movie, at times even vexing. The story spans 1000 years with three interconnected story lines. One is a fable of Tomas's search for the mythical Tree of Life in the New World. In the present day, Tommy (Jackman) is a brilliant and impetuous medical researcher consumed with finding a cure for his dying wife Izzy (Weisz), who suffers from a malignant brain tumor. The cure may lie in a botanical sample from Central America. In the distant future Tom (also Jackman) is on solo trek to the nebula from a Mayan legend on a mission to return the Tree of Life. Aronofsky darts back and forth between all stories at will, culminating in the compelling catharsis. Here I thought he went a little nonlinear and tangential. However, the final resolution is moving and poignant.Hugh Jackman is absolutely amazing. Though ""The Fountain"" mandates concentration and effort upon viewing, Jackman's performance is effortless. I don't think anyone else could have pulled off this role. The strikingly handsome and physical Jackman has the charisma to realize the brave conquistador Captain Tomas. As researcher Tommy he is the compassionate and driven husband caring for his ailing wife Izzy. In the future as Tom, a head shaved Jackman embodies a lonely and haunted man full of regret as he looks back upon his life. Jackman is that rare combination of powerful presence and gentle compassion. Rachel Weisz is inspiring as Tommy's eternal love over several lifetimes. Weisz commands a quiet strength and a natural ease. She gives Izzy a tangible nobility. She and Jackman have beautiful chemistry. Their touching love story endures the provocative narrative shifts throughout.""The Fountain"" promises a story about eternal life, and instead delivers a moving and touching story about our mortality. Perhaps, ""The Fountain"" is about living with grace. Darren Aronofsky does not cleanly resolve everything. I guess much like life, we have to kind of work it out for ourselves. Acknowledge Aronofsky and story writer Handel for making a movie dominated by grand ideas. Hugh Jackman and Rachel Weisz give inspiring and resonating performances in this eternal love story. ""The Fountain"" is not the easiest movie to watch, nor is it the most black and white. However, it will make you look upon life. And that is a noble thing.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
A failed experiment,"For this movie, the viewer has to have an open mind... a VERY OPEN mind! Tons of Flashbacks & flash forwards & repeating of scenes, it was ridiculously done in my opinion.

This is the story about a Conquistador in one time period, a doctor in another time period, and a futuristic scientist all seeking life everlasting (referenced from the Tree of everlasting life in the Garden of Eden). My girlfriend and i agreed that if they had just stuck with the present time story, it would have been an interesting movie and there was no fountain at all in whole thing.

"A miraculous film achievement, a story so beautiful it must be seen to be believed","""Our bodies are prisons, for our souls. All flesh decays... death turns all to ash. And thus, death frees every soul...""The Fountain is the closest I will get to having a religious experience in a movie theater this year. It is a miraculous film achievement, a testament to the hard work and dedication that Director Darren Aronofsky has poured into his passionate project over the last several years. His wife, a beautiful Rachel Weisz, stars with Hugh Jackman in a love story that transcends time, space, and body. Three different tales taking place over one thousand years intertwine into a story so bold and so beautiful, it must be seen to be believed.In the first of the stories, Jackman is Spanish Conquistador Tomas, a warrior in 1500 A.D. who travels to the Mayan ruins in search of the sap from the Tree of Life, in order to live forever with Queen Isabel (Weisz), whom he is in love with. In the second story, which takes place in the present, he is Tommy, a surgeon who may have stumbled on the key to immortality by accident, when the rosin used in a surgery on an ape brings unforeseen result: complete healing. He must race to find the cure to his wife Izzy's sickness, which is claiming her life quickly. The third is the oddest, and the most brilliant. It takes place in an orb of sorts, which is traveling through the universe. In it, Jackman is Tom Creo, a mix of both of the last two incarnations and a new man. He is alone, except for a tree, perhaps The Tree, which we are lead to assume is the re-incarnated Izzy/Isabel.What is The Fountain about? I've been trying to figure that out ever since I left the theater a few hours ago. I think above all, it is a look at how beautiful an undying love is. It is no coincidence that Aronofsky shoots Weisz as if she is a goddess; she is his wife, and she is beautiful. Jackman's performance is passionate and emotional, which complements the calmness of Weisz's. Izzy knows that she is going to die, but she is not afraid. It is tragic in a way, but blissful in another. It doesn't have a definitive end point because the story unfolds in a completely un-chronological way. When it does conclude, the ending is simultaneously maddening and perfectly fitting with the rest of this visually and thematically orgasmic film.Review posted by James Chapel on www.boxofficefanatic.com",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
A beautiful love story that ascends the physical plane,"One of the most beautiful films about love and life I have ever seen. I've never written a review on IMDb before, but really felt compelled to do so just for this film. The story it tells on the topmost level is simple, but the experience and spiritual journey it takes you on leaves a profound and powerful impact from which a true genius of a director such as Aronofsky can only attain. I usually walk away from a film and leave it behind in the theater where it screened, but this film ""walked away"" with me. I can't shake it, and I'm glad I can't. This will sound really corny, but it's affected me down to my soul and I can honestly say I feel better because of it. Hugh Jackman as Tom is awesome and perfectly played. Rachel Weisz as Izzi is truly a beauty that radiates from deep within. Beautifully shot.

A Beautiful Shame,"This is a film made by an expert director, acted with expert actors, and shot beautifully. The ideas exhibited, for 2006, and even today, are way ahead of their time. The style of shooting and usage of match cuts is really top notch. But the reason that it is a shame is because it was a film that, before and during production had many problems. Mainly with finance. Actors were changed frequently, and it went from a $70 million budget to $35 million. It is very understandable that this could shake up the pace and overall flow of the film. Personally, I enjoyed it, I found it challenging and extremely thought provoking. But I feel that, had it been more fortunate during pre-production and production it could have easily been one of the greatest films of the decade. It is so beautiful, but because it just falls short it makes me so sad. It makes me sad to think what it could have been.

"Terrible Movie - ""I want my $6.50 back!!!""","It's been roughly 3 hours since I came home from watching that movie with a few friends. Along with all the people walking out of the theatre with us, facial expressions and moods were basically the same, teary eyed and sunken, not because we were from whatever happened in the film, but because they had just woke up from a 96 minute nap, and a realization that th0se 96 minutes of our mortal lives had been torn away and lost forever. Why did we watch this movie? The idea of exploring immortality and eternal life might have caught our attention, but maybe because the trailer looked cool.The Fountain was hard to follow at times, however, no matter how much we tried to give this movie a chance that it would come up with scenes that would excite or kick it up a notch, it never did. Instead, it leaves us listening to some repetitive, redundant, redundant, repetitive quote i must've heard 10 straight times in one part saying: ""(I can't even remember what the d*** Iz said 'cause after hearing it over and over i must have tuned it out already)."" Anyway, after that useless, piece of crap line was said, the credits show with the director's name first as usual. The most hilarious thing about that part was that in the middle of the silence of seeing the credits already, my friend 2 seats to my right gives a very useful and definitely agreeable exclamation, ""WHAT THE HELL?!"". My friend followed it with a couple of audible 'BOOS'. I was relieved to hear laughs in the rows down and around us because of course, what the hell was that movie anyway? I expected to hear some cocky intellectuals get up and bash at my friend for making those remarks but hell if they did(nobody did), i would've said that was a piece of sh*t movie anyway. I'm experiencing heavy Deja Vu right now but hey!, that movie was showing too, why didn't we just see that instead? Too bad, my time's run out...I saw Happy Feet a few days ago and even thought that was way better than this *agbag of a movie.",1.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"

Movie descriptions are lousy,"Where do they get those ""Plot Lines""? It is NOT about 3 parallel lives spanning over 1000 years. It is one man's reconciliation with death. It is 3 aspects of HIS life, his heart, his mind and the spiritual aspect. The heart thread of his life is told thru his wife's story, the mind is told thru the story of his life and the spiritual is . . . well, all that spiritual stuff with the tree out in space. That is it. NO 3 lives or 1000 years, but 1 man, 1 life and his reconciliation with death. Simple. And that is why it is so powerful.

"Pointless, 2-dimensional, yet aims to be somehow deep","Superficially, this movie concerns two lovers: one of whom is dying, but accepts her death, and the other who desperately tries to prevent it.Unfortunately, the above summary is a complete description of their characters - that's it, there's nothing else there. While the viewer sees various scenes depicting these two, there are no moments in which they deviate from this narrow focus.The movie is full of beautiful symbolism - its sole redeeming factor. However, the beautiful symbolism does not make insightful. With characters as shallow as the two leads, the movie inevitably fails distill any meaning from it's many ""dramatic"" moments.Watch this movie if you didn't know death is difficult, and not just for the one dieing.

Personal favorite,"Watched this movie again for the I don't know how many times already and it hits me every time. Why this movie didn't get more nominations is beyond me. Hugh Jackman seriously deserved an Oscar for this role. So genuine, so well performed. The story is so well written. Maybe it hits home for me. watched it with my partner today and he gave it a 5, just because he didn't get it. But that's the whole thing with this movie. YOu should not try to get it, but you should feel it. Let the combination of images and music find it's way inside you. The love you can have for one person to do anything to safe his or her life. The roughness of the movie where success is just a factor you can't influence. The symbolic behind it all, taking from more than one religion and yet no propaganda of another. Almost creating it's own, creating life. I can't watch this movie with dry eyes. have tried it so many times. this, for me, truly, is the best movie ever made.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
"Whatever happened to character, story, and pacing?","I have never in my life been so disappointed in a movie. This was a 96 minute set piece for beautifully constructed images that contrast with the tight closeups of people whispering through tears as they lament, with no emotion, about life, eternity and love. Love? I'm sorry, but there is no reason for me to believe that these two even belong together. He's a jerk with his own agenda, she wants him to finish her awful book about a Conquistador who has to fight for a Queen (Jackman and Weisz play triple roles, sort of) in the most sleep-inducing segments of the movie. I find it very hard to believe that this was a movie 6 years in the making. When i saw Requiem For a Dream, the detached emotion of the dialogue added to the intensity of the story. Maybe people don't really talk that way, but it all fit together to make you feel almost crazy - the music, the crazy pacing and unbelievable cinematography - it really took you on a ride. But I felt like a large part of Requiem was grounded in reality, if a heightened vision of it. The Fountain has minor characters that speak as if they've just been given their lines, struggling to remember, without giving any depth of emotion to the dialogue. It has a story that is so pretentious, it had me laughing when everyone in the audience was holding their breath. The worst part is that people are falling for it. I've never in my life wanted so badly to walk out of a movie - I've never, ever been so disinterested in a movie, like I was with the Fountain. I wish someone had warned me - do something else with your time, please. I feel so cheated - it's going to be a while before I see a movie in theatres again.",1.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
Awe Inspiring,"When I first saw this film last year it was immediately in my Top 10.Having just watched it for second time I can safely say this film is my Top film of all time.I was almost fearful of watching the film again in case it didn't live up to its initial impression but I had nothing to fear - if anything its even better second time round (if such a film could get better).I have no intention of trying to break this film down or to analyse or discuss the metaphors and imagery - in my opinion to do that is to negate the beauty of this film.What I will say is that no film has ever touched me or moved me in the way this one has.Darren Aronofsky is a true visionary - and the making of this film is 10 years well spent.Hugh Jackman delivers the performance of a lifetime and whilst her performance does not appear to shine in the same way Jackman does this is because Rachael Weisz is just simply perfect.I read that originally Brad Pitt & Cate Blanchet were cast as the leads and I am truly thankful that they pulled out. Cate Blanchet is an impressive actress however I feel she would have lacked the warmth that Weisz brings to the role and whilst I am a fan of Brad Pitt I do not feel that he would have been able to deliver in the way that Jackman does.Aronofsky's genius skilfully & seamlessly links the three stories/periods so the three are essentially (and quite intentionally) one, the cinematography is beautiful and the score is equally impressive.This film is special.Thank you Mr Aronofsky.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
Polished,"Everything Aronofsky touches turns to gold. The Fountain is much more polished than Requiem for a Dream or Pi, but still retains his signature short takes and visual design; the film reminded me of Beyond the Black Rainbow toward the end. I also found it much more easy to follow than Pi, maybe because the characters are more expressive, and the soundtrack is less tremulous.If you understand the basic history of Spanish conquest of the Americas, and the way Native Americans were treated at the time, you'll have a much better time watching the film, but it isn't strictly necessary. Really a great movie though, I think that Arenofsky will be much more appreciated in the future, after his work has had some time to age.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"

Fountain of Dreck...,"I consider to myself to be an intelligent person and I consider myself to be a fan of Darren Aronofsky but the Fountain is absurd, pretentious, boring and uninvolving. Lacking the visual impact of his earlier films it tells the story of two people throughout the ages played confidently by weisz and Jackman. What it comes down to without giving anything away is the film is about creation through death. Which is understandably a powerful and intriguing idea but never has it been done so creatively and uninvolving. The characters are hardly developed and though they are not the main focus they should be. Because without an emotional attachment in this type of film it just doesn't work. The film is confusing at best but not because of its intelligence or coherence but because it tries to be different when it probably would have been more effective played straight. What seems to be leading up to a powerful plot revelation is something you already attained within the first third. There is a lot of symbolism and subtext but the film is very repetitive within its limited themes. Aronofsky has some important things to say but doesn't know how to say them. The film's pacing makes it seem hours when it's just 96 minutes. The performances are good but the characters are poorly written and underdeveloped and the cinematography is acceptable but cheap looking. There are no other words but to describe this movie except to say it's a waste of time. maybe my expectations were to high after his previous two victories but this films wreaks of studio meddling, whats left has nothing to say and should only be seen by extreme art-house fans who like something just because its different and no one else likes it and by insomniacs looking to finally get some sleep.",2.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
Be patient with this movie and please think about it,"When I set to write something about this movie I had only one dilemma; is it going to be short or massive comment. I decided to be as short as I can, cause words can hardly describe what I feel. Maybe just one word: unique. Unique on many levels; writing ,acting, music...Sound background fits perfectly in this story telling and the acting of Hugh Jackman & Rachel Weisz is amazing. I knew that Weisz is good actress, but this is movie where Jackman became a real actor. This is so heavy role and Jackman done it nearly with perfection.Something about the script; movie follows three stories. Each one from the past, present, and future - conquistador in Mayan country searches for the tree of life to free his captive queen; medical researcher, working with various trees, looks for a cure that will save his dying wife; a space traveler, traveling with an aged tree encapsulated within a bubble. My understandings (don't read any more if you haven't watched it): The only story that is really happening is the one that takes place in present. Story from the future presents Tommy and that tree. Probably you've all realized that Izzi is actually that tree, cause when she dies, tree dies too. Story from the past is search for eternal life, actually Tommy's search for cure that would save Izzi. At the end Tommy dies in future and past. In future to bring life to that tree that presents his everlasting love to Izzi and in past where he dies and fails to save Spain and live happily ever after with Queen (Izzi). In the present Izzi couldn't be saved but the whole story leaves us bright hope that Tommy will find cure and he says: ""Death is a disease, it's like any other. And there's a cure. A cure - and I will find it.""At the end, this is a big comment. Sorry, I got carried away. But I didn't changed my mind regarding this movie. Really superb piece of art that will have negative reviews only from those who couldn't understand this beautiful movie or from those who simply don't want to use brain to interpret this story.",8.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
Beautiful and underrated film,"I remember watching this film years ago and loving every second of it. I owned the DVD for years until it inexplicably died on me. So for at least 11 years, I did not watch the film. So here I am, older and much different and less pretentious in my film going ways. Even after a long absence from viewing this film, it still hits all of the most visceral feelings in my body.I feel the loneliness. I feel the loss. I feel the desire to want something so bad that you would do anything to keep it. All those things happened over the last 11 years for me and this simple little film brings all of those emotions to the surface. Darren Aronofski has gone in other directions with his film making as of late, but we can credit this film as a strange and unique passage in his backlog.The color timing is dark and warm, yet the story is bleak and hard to stomach. We see Dr. Tommy Creo, desperately and heart wrenchingly played by Hugh Jackman, trying to solve the mystery of death. His wife Izzy is dying from a brain tumor and rather than accept the truth, he is using his own knowledge of the physical world to stop the process. We all know he will not succeed, and it is awful to see the descent of madness that overcomes him.Aronofski expertly weaves together three timelines, and it all culminates in an ending that is both surreal and incredible. One can only imagine what this film would have looked like with the original budget it had and the original casting of Brad Pitt, but I am glad we have this version. I feel Jackman's range sold the performance much better than Pitt could have done.The world may have forgotten this movie along time ago but it will continue to resonate with those who truly enjoy it.

Amazing - Best Movie Ever!,"This is an amazing movie. It is my favorite movie of all times. I think this is because I relate to the matter this is something extremely close to my heart could be the reason I can rank it as THE best movie of all times.Reasons of which I'll explore later here, but the interesting bit is, and what is even more amazing than the movie itself is that it flopped! It made M 25 USD compared to M 40 USD that went into the making of this movie. Even more surprising is its rating of 7.5, I've generally agreed with and used as recommendations for movies I ought to watch. But this 7.5 is a joke! Really is, try to concentrate real hard on the movie or watch it over a few times of think about it, but its a beautiful movie!In fact it has changed, or reminded me of my opinion on what is good and what is not again (...good is what is liked by many ...blah..) Its an extremely difficult theme and topic to deal with, and I can still not believe that Darren could thought of it all and put it all together. He deserves to be called a genius for this piece of art. The acting is brilliant, especially when looked at how little time goes into building characters, cause there are so many other things to be said. Expressions that Hugh puts up can move a receptive person to tears.What the story is about? Take your pick, its about Xabalba , about Hindu philosophy of life and death or even about Karma (the oft used & frequently misused word). But its also about how one behaves in a given moment - and the timeless huge explanation for each action and how one action can determine so much and in turn how everything gives rise to that particular action. So it is also a philosophical expression to one word.I would suggest you go watch the film, even if you don't understand or like it a lot.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"

""All is lost, so deal with it"" is the movie's theme, which it successfully conveys by causing you to loss to two hours of your life.This movie through an esoteric and eastern mystical lens tries to convey with beauty and repetition the desire for a tree or fountain that grants eternal life (while I would be satisfied with a tree or fountain that gives me back the last two hours of my life.)

This film is the best thing I've seen since Hitchcock,"Artistic genius, stirring story, and engrossing soundtrack. This film had it all. The upsetting thing about the film, is that to many idiots don't understand the piece. It's sad to see people walk out on a piece of this caliber because they can't grasp the artistic cinematography. If you don't want to think and be engrossed into a film, go watch some action movie.With the artistic style used in 2001 (the way the did the art), it was a beautifully done piece. The images were amazing, and perfectly done for the type of film it was. I'm very very happy to see the lack of CGI, even though I myself went to school for computer graphics. The lack of sound, made this soundtrack perfect. It was genius how David pulled the watcher into the emotions of Hugh by cutting the sound, absolutely no ambient sound, just Hugh walking, or perfect silence, brilliant. And the story line, pulling you through his mind dealing with the loss of his wife, at first being distraught and not wanting to lose her, then fighting with the very nature of life and wanting to find a way to cure death, then finally realizing and accepting that she was still a part of the world and accepting that by planting the tree, it was very moving and perfect for the artistic feeling of the film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"

This is not a quickie get-in, get-out, eye-candy popcorn movie, which I actually rather expected. It's a deliberate, multi-layered, methodical masterpiece. It's somewhat inaccessible because it's visionary and unlike any sf movie we expect today. I predict that it will have a slow theatrical run and will probably disappoint at the box office. Over the next few years, it will slowly grow as a cult film. Then 10 years from now, it will experience a resurgence of interest, eventually claiming its place in the pantheon of classics. It will be under-appreciated in its time but will become surprisingly influential. Years from now, a much savvier generation will look back and wonder why the audience of 2006 neglected it in favor of Happy Feet and James Bond. That's the kind of movie this is.

"""We spend our entire lives trying to become whole...""","Two thousand six has been a year of phenomenally ambitious cinematic excursions, and Darren Aronofsky's The Fountain belongs right up there on the top of that list, in my opinion, along with The Illusionist.It is astoundingly difficult - nearly impossible - to portray the unportrayable, but Aronofsky succeeds in doing just that in The Fountain, and he does it with breathtaking purity of vision and the surehandness of a master.In his supremely down-to-earth interview with Capone from aintitcool.com (see link below), Aronofsky says, ""The Fountain of Youth is one of our oldest ancient myths--if not the oldest myth--that people have been telling, because people have been coming up with stories how to deal with the fear of death. And, trying to find out the reason of why we're here and what is life and what is love. And what happens when you die. These are questions that people have been asking since the beginning of time. So, there's absolutely no way that this schmoe from Brooklyn is going to be able to answer them. That's not the reality here. For me, it's a film that's a journey and it's a trip and it's an experience through the meditation of a lot of these questions...""As a writer and 'schmoe from Brooklyn' myself, I particularly appreciate what he's saying here. The journey of the two main characters/souls, portrayed magnificently by Jackman and Weitz, is indeed at the center of the film, which must have been excruciatingly hard to edit - a miracle in itself - but they got it right: it flows, from beginning to end, like a fountain, in a sublime, indescribably perfect circle.The rest of the interview: http://www.aintitcool.com/node/30768",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
piece of crap!,"Definitely one of the worst movies I have seen this year.

It seemed like the director wanted to touch on every genre without doing any of them well. The action scenes were ho-hum, the love story was boring, the sci-fi was not very well thought out, the plot was thick and slow and had a horrible finish, The visuals were pretty but nothing spectacular and the filming was way too tight for a film that was hyped as visually stunning. If you want to make a big visual movie then don't have every character framed in superclose-up. All the scenes seemed to be taped in a small room. Even the stupid tree scenes were in a bubble.

Visual Masterpiece with Complex Thematic Interconnections,"Summarizing this movie from a plot perspective is almost pointless, though I'll attempt it, anyway. The Fountain spans one thousand years to capture the portrait of a man and his woman's quest towards immortality. While the woman, representative of the female energy of the universe, nurturing and open, is receptive and aware of the film's ultimate ending, the man, representative of logic and rationalism, must overcome his own intellectual ferocity in order to attain his destiny. The film is littered with geometric symbols that reflect the movie's thematic iconography; for instance, the Tree of Life--as described in the bible--represents divine order and purpose throughout the Fountain. However, what the average film-goer will miss in watching the movie is the geometric visuals that are actual representations of the Egyptian Flower of Life and the mathematical Phi-Ratio as represented in the nautical shell. There are also an overwhelming abundance of mandala-like entrances into rooms, artwork, and set design, which aid the viewer into looking toward the infinite.

An ambitious and thought provoking film,"This movie is definitely one I would consider to be an ""artsy"" film. I'm someone who isn't particularly fond of artsy films to put it lightly. In fact, the first time I tried to watch this film I turned it off within the first 15 minutes. A few months later I decided to try to watch it a second time. This time I made a conscious decision to sit and watch through the whole movie.By the end of this film I was awed and mystified by the powerful message and beauty of this film. The fountain tells a story spanning across time from the past to the present and into the future. The message is deep but the meaning of the movie isn't clear without some effort on the viewer's part to decipher the story. The film's message is also darker and more pessimistic than most people's idea concerning life, death, love and hope. Logically speaking though, the ideas in this film are actually very realistic with most people's experiences across the world. I don't want to give away any of the story so that's all I will say in regards to the content of the movie.If you're willing to open your mind, want to see a film unlike any other, appreciate an artistic film, are a fan of amazing soundtracks and don't mind a unorthodox message regarding our existence as human beings; this film will amaze you.

The fountain of brilliance,"Greetings all,So the order of the day is a story that transcends intertwining time lines, and by Jove does this film do it in such accomplished manner. If that wasn't enough, each separate story may be portrayed in a nonlinear fashion, much to my delight, as I do love that which is not run-of-the-mill.When it commences one may question the ambiguity/vagueness of the three short stories, as little explanation is provided for each. But with the progression of the film will come an admiration for this style, which will endear the viewer no end to the six main characters, all of whom are played wonderfully by Hugh Jackman and Rachel Weisz respectively.Complemented further are these scenes with their beautiful transitions through general motifs that overlie each set piece, and gradually build on each character's history. Another standout aspect for me.Clint Mansell does a good a job as ever, matching the tone of each scene with perfection, leading to a greater immersion in the subject matter. A very memorable score indeed.My only slight foible would be that for the general viewer this may prove a little too complex, if not given enough of a chance. And some of the residing biblical connotations may be out of favour for some.This film is more than just spectacle, it delivers on so many levels. I must say with great confidence that this is perhaps Jackman's career-defining role. And although I don't find Aronofsky to be a consistent high performer, I'll say without a doubt that The Fountain is my favourite film of his.

The rich history that you are taken through is just this insane and incredible journey that absolutely just pulls at the fibers of your heart!Something very nostalgic about it was, if you had the cartoon ""The Little Prince"", the scenes that take place in the future remind me of that child and his journey as well.I just feel I just do not have accurate words to describe how unbelievably beautiful and uncontrollably sad this film is. You just have to watch it. Trust me. And then watch it again without shedding a tear in the first 10 minutes.

The Worst Film Ever,"I am totally shocked that anyone in their right mind is sitting here raving about the hidden genius of this film while I have never been so ready to leave the theater.I like to enjoy a film on two levels; first, being in the movie and being entertained by the story, secondly analyzing hidden messages and symbolism after the film. It bothers me that anyone can appreciate the second without the first.The fact is, this movie is hard to watch. It is weird, it skips around, you don't know enough about any of characters to care if they live or die, and well, half the movie takes place in a bubble floating though space where a guy is nursing a tree with hair. And what did you like about this movie?Furthermore, I have read people's comments about the supposed ""brilliant"" symbolism of the movie. OK, so these stories are connected, after death they are together, the tree represents the life and the 12 tribes of Israel, the main characters are Adam and Evem and after death they are together.... WHO CARES? First of all, no symbolism or meaning in this movie is original. We've seen these themes thousands of times! The fact is there are a million movies you can draw the same end meaning from that are actually watchable! It hurts me that people try so hard to be intellectuals that they actually pretend to like this. It is like when someone takes a crap in a bag, puts it in an art museum, and then people sit around marveling at its significance.",1.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
Truly a masterpiece,"This film is just, wow. I've been waiting to see it for months and it reached more than my expectations. There's something about this movie that I just can't describe. The visuals are stunning, the actors are stunning, the style is stunning, the music is stunning, the story is amazing...First you watch it and it's already an incredible experience, but a couple days later your mind will get disturbed. The movie is intense and unique in so many ways that you just can't capture the whole thing the first time you watch it. Many interpretations can be made about the real story and timeline of this movie. For this reason and many others, it will become a cult. I can't wait to watch it again from a different angle.My advice : you can pay 10 bucks for your ticket, but a soul is priceless, and you need one to watch The Fountain.Classic.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
Not for everyone,"I love films of every genre and that includes subtle ones with twists and turns. I am not going to bore anyone with repeating a lot of what has been said in the previous reviews. Within about 10 minutes into the film where Hugh Jackman is in a bubble with a tree in it and floating somewhere in space, I started to feel the disconnect. Not long after that I had the feeling that the director was trying to make a film that had the essence of ""2001, A Space Odyssey"" but it just wasn't happening. It has been a long time that after watching a film for 45 minutes that I have felt like I have been semi tortured but ""The Fountain"" certainly had that effect on me. I stopped watching it midway and was glad that I hadn't wasted more time on it than I did. Others seem to have loved it but frankly I can't imagine why. The cast was excellent and can't imagine what they saw in this film's script that made them want to take it on. Unbearable.",1.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
the worst movie I saw in years....,"I was highly anticipating this movie. I read nice things about it and was expecting to have the same amazing experience as while watching eternal sunshine of the spotless mind. Sadly I didn't see The Fountain in the cinema (it was on screen only for two weeks in Berlin- that was a sign I ignored-). Then later in a shop, I saw the DVD, special edition, and got it! And OMG!!! For sure, the cinematography is amazing, the performance great, but I was trying to find a plot during the entire movie. And I never succeed! the only thing I had in mind at the end was: why did I bought the special edition and not rent it? The idea of dealing with immortality was interesting. But for me, this movie was confusing, really slow. Completely overrated.One advice then: if you want to try the Fountain experience, rent it.

Why do some fear death while others don't and are able to see it as an act of creation?These are some of the questions that came to mind when watching The Fountain.

Not even earnest acting by Hugh Jackman and Rachel Weisz could save this film,"Horrible and pretentious. Not even earnest acting by Hugh Jackman and Rachel Weisz could save this film by Weisz's fiancé, writer/director Darren Aronofsky. Some woman in the cinema was snoring loudly and none of us bothered to shush her because it was understandably a snoozefest.The main plot line is simple: Tom (Jackman) is a doctor married to Izzi (Weisz), a dying writer. Tom furiously tries to find a cure for her disease. He says, ""Death is a disease, it's like any other. And there's a cure. A cure - and I will find it.""Then the story finds parallels with the story Izzi is writing in her book (in longhand, using old school pen and ink, for crying out loud, with no erasures!), where Tom and Izzi also play the characters. It also has a third subplot (?) where Tom is a bald, tattooed Zen-like monk-like man trapped in a snow globe. Lots of New Age mumbo jumbo, which was supposed to be visually poetic, tons of closeups of something that looked like yellow amber, and stylized cinematography.The Fountain has terribly redundant and cheesy writing, too:Izzi: Will you deliver Spain from bondage? Tom Verde: Upon my honor and my life. Izzi: Then you shall take this ring to remind you of your promise. You shall wear it when you find Eden, and when you return, I shall be your Eve. Together we will live forever.Even hot, talented men like Jackman make mistakes. Imagine agreeing to shaving his head and chest for the worst sequence ever with an object (a tree). Tom Hanks and 'Wilson' in Cast Away did so much better.That was 96 mins. of my life I will never get back. Don't make the same mistake I made. Watch something else.",1.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
Sometimes bad is bad.,"I'm getting kind of worried about the state of Western movie-going culture. Not only do we have X-men, Ironmen, Incredible Hulks, King Kongs and Lords of the Ring crowding in upon us from every direction: but this kid and teenage stuff starts creeping into the works of even apparently sensible directors like Aronofsky. It's really sad: this is a ""story"" which seems to be copied from a rejected late episode of the ""X-files"" – and people discuss it as if it was important and thought-provoking! Well, maybe they are young and have no standards of comparison. Still.

A metaphysical abstract film on... death,"The Fountain is drenched in misery and misfortune. I regularly find myself led to this type of films. What makes films that emanate such sadness appeal so much to me? Is that the same reason why people listen to sad songs? Perhaps so. Well, The Fountain isn't your average pessimistic film, it's allegorical, visually lurid, and psychedelic. The film jumps mercilessly from scene to scene, and the overarching climax behind the narrative progresses with an intensity far beyond the fathomable. Hugh Jackman (Tomas) so far-removed from reality he drags the audience with him, on a metaphysical journey remarkably grand and ambitious it tips into abstract thought.Yet, the themes it rubs on is by nature not a subject matter considered delicate. Death is experienced by everyone but at the same time, it's not. How strange is that? How do you explore a theme that nobody alive has gone through? Hence, it's no grand fault of the film to turn to abstract ideals, it informs the audience that this is something to trifle with. Ideas of life amidst death are contrasting and contradictory. Similarly, the film is contrasting and contradictory if three highly distinct backdrops play side-by-side in the movie yet spelling the same narrative. The film is hard to judge, and take that what you will. It depends on how you as the audience react to the visuals, sounds and story of this movie. It's not easy to swallow.But I don't want to watch something digestible. If life is so short, I want something to challenge my beliefs, educate my sensations, and strive for the lofty goals. Esoteric, austere and unforgiving. It's a film on tragedy and how we overcome it. As humans, we are fortunate to possess a medium that supports the sharing of ideas. While the idea isn't new, the delivery is one of a kind. If you aren't interested in looking at abstract pictures that resemble the incomprehensible, that's fine. Most people don't. But it's tough to admit that, when gazing at it, that it doesn't offer to your imagination.",8.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
Extraordinary visual beauty and vision,"After poor reviews and short run time at the theater, one might not expect much (the best way to see a film of course). Having read something of the use of organic liquid processes (light, oil, water) instead of CGI for cosmic screen effects though, I was curious.It turned out to be a film of such extraordinary visual beauty, power and vision, resonant of our deepest earthly yearnings - love, conquest, transcendence and immortality. The fact that it's beauty and vision is lost on so many reviewers is a reminder that when mainstreamed so much high budget, Hollywood formula film, we tend to become insensitive and impatient so as to completely miss the deep pleasure of a rare and lasting treat.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"

I feel it could have been told in a way that would keep the style yet also be ""entertaining"". I don't mean this in an enjoyable way, but a tear-jerker done well can still be entertaining.Two couples got up & left within the first 30 minutes of the movie & I gave it another 1/2 hr before I got up & left.

Attention Sci-Fi Geeks: Take Your Women To See This Flick!,"Okay all of you sci-fi geeks out there. It's time to drag your spouse, girlfriend, or significant other out again. They'll hem and haw about going to see ""yet another"" science fiction film with you, but this time redemption is at your feet.THE FOUNTAIN is, for all intents and purposes, a love story built around an SF theme: immortality and the future. But there aren't any magical conjurers or any time machines. The story is all too human, spanning eons as we witness the immortality of ...love. It may sound a bit offish to some SF fans, but don't let it be. There are still amazing scenes shot using bizarre methods (micro-photography of petri dishes?) instead of the usual CGI, a remarkable coherency between the vast time scales, and some damn fine acting.Hugh Jackman (X-Men) stars as Tomas, a man in love with his queen (during the Spanish Inquisition), his terminally ill wife (present day), and the symbol of his wife's immortality (in the distant future). Tomas' queen/wife/symbol is none other than the amazing Rachel Weisz (THE CONSTANT GARDNER) known throughout the film as Izzi. Tomas, in the earliest time of the Spanish Inquisition, is trying to save his beloved queen by finding the tree of life (something hinted at in many religions, including Christianity where Adam and Eve eat from the tree of knowledge causing God to yank away the tree of life and hide it).We then jump to present day and find Doctor Tomas desperately searching for a cancer cure in order to save his wife, Izzi. Again, the tree of life plays a part as he and his research team uncover a strange piece of bark from a long forgotten tree. It's healing properties are astounding, but will the cure come in time to save Izzi? The most distant time is that of Tomas on an existential journey through space with a tree as his only companion. Again, the tree of life, but this time the tree is appropriately a symbol of his wife.Weaving the conquistador past, with present day medicine, and an uncertain future, director Darren Aronofsky has really given us a piece of poetry as art. This isn't too surprising coming from Aronofsky, the same director of such mind-benders as PI and REQUIEM FOR A DREAM. Don't expect a formulaic plot or for things to be spelled out. You know better than that if you've seen any of this director's work. But that's part of the big draw. You move along with the story rather than being forcibly dragged through it. It flows on its own ethereal plain, never stopping, never letting the viewers' eyes rest. Each scene is shot to near perfection, using dark sets, lighted doorways, and golden globes to exquisite advantage.But it's the love story between Izzi and Tomas that holds the entire movie together. Their dedication to one another is palpable, and when Izzi sits near death's doorstep, you can feel Tomas' overwhelming need to save her, his beloved for all time.So it's time to haul your spouse/girlfriend/significant other kicking and screaming into the theater again. And they'll love you for it later. Perhaps you might even ""get lucky"" after the film...",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
Death breeds creationThe Fountain,"I never thought I would ever thank Brad Pitt for causing the utter failure of The Fountain launching principal photography three years ago. However, his leaving the production to do Troy may have resulted in the finest film-going experience I have ever had. Darren Aronofsky's masterpiece could only have been ruined by the doubled budget and lack of Hugh Jackman and Rachel Weisz's stellar performances. The epic scope this film has is that much better due to the small-scale effects honed and enlarged to full utilization. Much like this, Tom and Izzi's quest for eternal life spans mankind yet could be found inside themselves if they only looked hard enough. The Fountain is definitely a fantasy for adults and helps show the world the lengths we will go for love and how it can blind us to what truly matters in that most precious of unions.One can't truly explain this film; it is an experience that must be seen firsthand to even begin to fathom the effect it can have on the viewer. Aronofsky has crafted a tale of love through the pain of death. Hugh Jackman is a neurosurgeon desperately trying to discover a way to decrease the growth of tumors. While on a mission to help prevent death and disease in the world, he also must find a way to save his dying wife from the cancer that has begun taking its hold on her. The looming death set before Izzi, played with pure emotion by Rachel Weisz, has been accepted, yet can't be by her husband who knows he can cure her if he just had more time. Jackman is a shattered man on a quest which once started together, but now finishes alone. The futility of his situation cannot sink in and as a result he must continue on while his wife lays dying, trying her hardest to let him understand what is to come in the future. She shares her novel about a conquistador on a journey for Eden's Tree of Life, telling him that he needs to write the conclusion. The quest along the road to awe has been laid out for Tom and it is up to him to decide what he will do when he comes face to face with destiny. This surgeon will come to a choice where he will have to either choose finding the end of death, planting a tree to gather his wife's spirit for an afterlife through an ancient Mayan tale of Seebalba, or allow himself to accept that finality and hope for a continuing to life beyond it.While at first it may seem a bit convoluted and pretentious, this story is a simple one. Love binds us to each other and pulls a veil over the big picture when it does not concern the survival of our union. Instead of cherishing the time we have together on Earth, we would rather waste it all in desperate attempts to prolong our stay. Much like Adam and Eve being thrown from Eden for wanting more than each other, Tom and Izzi are at the point of their journey where they can eat the fruit and risk losing everything, or they can take a step back and live for the moment. We all face this challenge throughout our lives, and will continue to as the years go by. Darren Aronofsky shows us the problem as far back as the Spanish Inquisition, as far forward as the end of time being pulled into the nebular entrance to eternity, and at the present day, here and now. Izzi relates to the beauty of ancient Mayan tales of the afterlife and through her writings on a past life, sparks her husband's mind to imagine the journey through time and the road of disappointment it will lead him on. That road needs to be taken, however, for without the knowledge of pain and failure, one will never see that he must look inside himself for the answers that will bring him back to his love. When Jackman finally realizes what must happen, he expresses sheer joy and relief that his story has come to close, yet his life has been reborn for eternity.After his genius with previous films Pi and Requiem for a Dream, it is hard to believe that Aronofsky could enhance the medium of cinema even further. While others take from past visionaries and apply their findings to their own work, Aronofsky creates those new ways that will be adopted in the future. He is an innovator and with his work here takes another step closer, if not to totally justifying the call by some that he is the new Stanley Kubrick. Each step of The Fountain is orchestrated to the utmost detail and the symphony is one for the ages. Along with Clint Mansell's haunting score, Badalamenti to Darren's Lynch, this tale is one for all senses. The palpability and lushness of the effects in the future scenes are a feat to behold. Crossing between three time periods is daunting in itself, yet in the final minutes, going through each at breakneck speed leading to the tale's culmination is brilliant. No one else has the eye to make every banal, static shot seem magical and full of life. With seamless dissolves and gorgeous compositions, The Fountain is a feast for the eyes, intriguing at ever turn. However, the true magic lies in the story being told, one that will break your heart while simultaneously breathing a hope for everlasting love inside of you.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
Way over my head.,"I'm not ashamed to admit, despite a degree I'm not best suited to films with deep hidden meanings & what are commonly called 'arty-farty types' but despite trying hard with this, I don't believe anybody can claim that they ""got it"" (for want of a better phrase) in the same way nobody really 'got' Twin Peaks.There was a range of problems here, most noticeably the promotional advertising, as this film is not really a love story in the traditional sense and it certainly is not in the time-travel genre - it is merely spread over three eras.There is an uneven amount of time allocated to the three timelines and though the modern day one is the easiest to follow, it never brings you in. It's very claustrophobic - the lab, the hospital - there's never a sense of where they are and the outside world. There's a lot of overacting from the ensemble cast and an entire range of characters you never really care about.The other problem was the chronology the director went with. The version I saw was fairly short anyway at 90 minutes, but even in that there were scenes repeated two, three times over. Taking the three timelines individually - even within them, the scenes did not run chronologically and I cannot see the reasoning behind that.I would hope a 2nd or 3rd watch of this would enlighten me on how the three Tom's linked each other. If it does, it's difficult to pick up first time round - and when the whole plot of the film is incomprehensible to you, you're in trouble.I'm sure there are those to which this film is very well suited, but they're better people than me - who was mislead by descriptions of the film which are way, way off the mark.3/10.",3.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
Intensely personal story may be tough going if you can't click into its vibe,"Intensely personal about love and loss by Darren Aronofsky.Three ""stories"" that are actually inter related.

I saw this at a preview screening and Aronofsky was there to answer questions, the number one question: How did you make such great looking CGI? His Answer: It's not CGI, there are only two CGI shots in the whole film. The special effects were done by an English guy (I don't remember his name), who shoots chemical reactions under a microscope, that are then composited to make the beauty of The Fountain.

It's a masterpiece because it is bizarre yet you will be suspended from disbelief enough to become immersed.Now if it were longer I would have gone 10 stars, but then maybe I'm greedy. On the other hand, this film had tight editing which logically leads me to think that the director could have fluffed it up to lengthen it. Perhaps you could compare the Lord of the Rings trilogy. To me LOTR seemed excessively fluffed in that the edits weren't fast enough for my tastes.By the way, don't waste your time with a cheap, *ahem*...copy; obtain the DVD in order to get the genuine sound quality and the difficult to reproduce dark qualities of this uncompromising cinematographic gem .",9.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
Mesmerising and Profound.,"I don't know how to describe this film really. You can tell within the first 10 minutes that this is going to be something different and indeed it is. This is not a movie for the 2-second-attention-span/Big dumb explosion brigade. It doesn't hold your hand with bland exposition and it doesn't give you all the pieces of the puzzle so you can neatly fit them altogether and go away with answers to all your questions.What it does give you though is a deep and thought provoking experience surrounding the issues of mortality and how we deal with it. There were a lot of things in this movie that I didn't really understand but it managed to touch me at a level I can't quite define. Like 2001:A Space Odyssey I think there were parts of this film that were deliberately left ambiguous in order to give the story some mystery and wonder.The cinematography was absolutely beautiful as well and I can't believe the movie was made for $35m dollars, it looks far more expensive.It has to be said that the acting across the board was exceptional too with Hugh Jackman being of particular note although I really can't take Ethan Suplee seriously in the kind of role he had after seeing him in My Name is Earl but thankfully his part isn't too distracting.I don't think Brad Pitt would have done half the job Hugh Jackman did in this movie. I heard he left because of creative differences and I can imagine Aronofsky saying ""Look Brad this is my movie, I'm gonna do it my way, if you don't like it then f**k off."" and Brad being the ego his is couldn't let someone else have control so left, the big wuss.

The first movie I ever saw at the cinema was ""2001""...my uncle, for soem demented reason, took me to see it when I was 4.

I can see that Aronofksy is melding many different elements and ideas here, even if the fit is awkward at times. At least there are real ideas, and a real aesthetic vision, which is more than I can say for 95% of the commercial garbage out there.I think people have gotten it wrong in interpreting the message as some new age mumbo-jumbo. Certainly it is drawing from mythological sources, but the real meanings seem to lie more in the universals of love versus obsession, the struggle with mortality and the incomprehensibility of death. Then again, I am of the belief that spirituality has to do with the formation of meaning and needn't imply anything supernatural. And why should an empirical viewpoint preclude us from indulging in fantasy and allegory, especially at the service of exploring those things which make us human? As ridiculous as complaining that The Lord of the Rings is unrealistic.I grant that it is not the kind of thing easily palatable to mainstream audiences, that people primarily see movies to be told a story and be entertained, not to view a piece of visual art or be required to (gasp!) think. While those are perfectly legitimate, and I also see most movies for the same reasons, the ones that really stick with me are, like The Fountain, ambiguous, disorienting, and even absurd on first viewing. But if I challenge myself to give them another look, they open up new possibilities to me. On the level of plot this film is extremely simple, even simplistic (even if the way it is told is extremely nonlinear and convoluted), yet on the level of interpretation it is multi-faceted, though I fear few will bother with that. Aronofsky took some serious risks here and such are the consequences of daring to follow one's own vision.This is another example of why I hate film criticism (and the same goes for any other medium), because it prejudices people's perception before seeing something for themselves. I say when viewing this film try to forget everything anyone has said. You may love it, you may hate it, but neither of those reactions is right or wrong. This is art, not hard science.",9.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
The best film of the decade,"My friends. I had the extreme honor to go see The Fountain yesterday evening. Silence, Beauty, and Intelligence have all returned to the movies with this film. Everything that I admire about films was realized with this film. I didn't think that could be possible in this age of movies. Especially one produced by a major studio, but it has been done and done well. Let us start with the core element of any movie, the story. I wont give anything away so don't worry. The story is about ideas. Love, Death, Life are all central to the story. The ideas are presented straight forward but the nature of them makes them hard to swallow. The story was not boring or too brainy. There is action, love and intelligent scenes throughout. You want to know what is going to happen to these characters. The characters themselves are believable and the performances some of the best I've ever seen. Visually the film is the greatest achievement of the year and quite possibly the Decade. Every shot seem like it could have been a painting in a fine art museum, something that has not been achieved since Kubrick's Eyes wide Shut. Finding out that there were only 87 shots that were worked on by a computer is astounding. The use of the microscope slides for everything else blows me away. The music is top notch. The score was performed by Mogwai, one of the premier ambient bands in the world. If you like music from, Explosions in the sky, Godspeed you! Black Emperor and A Silver Mt. Zion, then you will love the music. Silence is also important to the film. There are long stretches of film where all there is no dialog, but just the ideas and events before our eyes. Please go see this and be amazed. Lovers of fine film will adore it. The average movie goer will not be able to deal with the film. It is not typical. It is extraordinary and The Fountain gives me hope for the future of movies",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
"Incredibly unique, touching movie","I'm really tired of reading reviews from movie critics that think this movie is horrible. People either seem to love it or hate it. I think the difference is that you need to be a somewhat intelligent person to fully appreciate this movie. Yes the movie is pretty incoherent and hard to piece things together, but if you can remember things that previously happened and kind of work it out in your head its just incredible. I for one like movies that make me think. Not only is this movie incredibly unique, but hugh jackman is incredible in it. I never gave hugh much credit before but if he doesn't get best actor for this movie then no one should. It's a very touching movie about love, life, and death and there's nothing else like it.

i don't understand the praise for this film,"I like thought provoking, intelligent films that often make you think about them long after you have finished watching them. Requiem for a Dream was one such film, many people said if I liked the directors work, i should try this film.The gushing praise for this film, for lack of a better phrase, beats the hell out of me. From the first scene, i had no idea what was really going on, it never made any sense, my wife and I looked at each other several times through the film dumbfounded.I guess ""visually"" it was a great spectacle but then again if you wanted to see a great visual sight you should go to an art gallery or go travelling.Films are meant to have a plot, a point, a story that is followable and if not credible, at least to have some tangible meaning, this failed in every respect.",1.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
I feel cheated.,"All right. I can appreciate artsy, intelligent films as much as anyone, but ""The Fountain"" was incredibly disappointing. And the sad thing is, everywhere I look people are giving it wonderful reviews and raving about its genius. Perhaps I'm just not smart enough to comprehend said ""genius,"" because when I came out of the theater, all I could think was, ""What...?"" The entire film was an incoherent mess. I was confused from the moment the movie began with only small glimmerings of comprehension throughout. I had hoped that everything would neatly tie together in the end, answering the questions that had accumulated in my mind throughout the film, but I got no answers. I could find only vague parallels between the three story lines present, if any at all. Granted, the visual effects were lovely, and the music was as well, if a little repetitive after being played continuously throughout the movie. But overall, the movie was dark (not that I mind dark films, but the lighting itself made it literally so), confusing, and just an utter waste of my time and money. Sure, if you're a teenage artist looking for a film that no one understands to make people think you're smart and to portray the ""fragility of life and humanity,"" then this is just the film for you. But if you come to me and sing praises of this tangled yarnball of a movie, I might just have to resort to physical violence. I am that sorely disappointed.",2.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
A poem made into film,"i am a big fan of darren aronofsky . The fountain really was not what i expected to see , but i was dazzled by this beautiful movie . It was different than most movie that i have seen before . First of all , there is no hip hop montage , so its a totally different tone . Second the narrative structure is not straightforward and it is probably the reason this movie received bad reviews . But the emotions you feel during that movie are incredible . To me , it felt as if someone was reading me a poem and the images were the visual representations in my mind . Clint mansel did an amasing job in scoring the music for the film with the Kronos quartet(same team than from requiem for a dream) . If you love cinema in general and have liked other films than james bond or rob Schneider movies , go see it , its one rare masterpiece that really is worth your ten dollars , otherwise , go see borat or something else . Finally , i strongly suggest you ignore the bad reviews and go see the movie for yourself , it is magnificent .",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
Amazing...,"This movie is simply amazing. For one, the writer is the one who produced Requiem for a Dream, one of my favorite movies and Clint Mansell also did the music for this movie. Putting that aside though, this movie almost brought me to tears so many times. The drama scenes with Hugh Jackman are incredibly real. He just isn't sobbing for the movie, it seems like the scenes are real....which means that's good acting.lol. The concept of the movie is amazing too. Some parts of the movie are ambiguous and open for interpretation. Even if you don't get those parts of the movie though the main story line is very easy to grasp and awesome.

From the opening scene to the close I was in awe. The visuals, the score, and the story had me completely captivated. I always see a part of myself in Hugh Jackman characters so it is easy to connect with Tommy. This is a movie that will stick with you forever and change the way you thinkabout love, life, and death.

Pseudo-Intellectual Codswallop,"At last we have a 2001 for our time. Kubrick's film was full of nice images and had all the intellectual content of a 3 day old slushy, not surprisingly it made imbeciles feel cleverer than ordinary folk. Aronofvsky had previously made the shockingly bad ""Requiem For A Dream"", a melodrama so lurid and OTT it induced chuckles. I never believed he had the capability to outdo the rankness of that effort but astonishingly he has succeeded with room to spare. Over 3 different time spans of bad acting and worse dialogue we learn that love is good and death bad. Flicking channels after this I came across ""Beerfest"", in it's own way a very bad film, it seemed like a masterpiece after ""The Fountain"".",1.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
terrible idea,"I admit, I didn't get it. I thought it didn't make sense. I did sort of get the past scenes with Tom as a conquistador and the present as a scientist searching for a cure for his wife's brain tumor. But the future Tom made no sense. Being in outer space, a giant tree, surrounded by a ball; it was plain silly. And why this movie did poorly at the box office. Was it supposed to be the exact same Tom as a conquistador and in the present or just his spirit the same? And what about Izzy? Was it the same woman or spirit or soul or whatever?FINAL VERDICT: I did not like this at all. Definitely one of the worst sci-fi films I've seen in a while.",2.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
The Fountain,"Darren Aronofsky has always been a little weird, his directorial debut µ was a crazed black and white drug filled trip through the mind of a mad scientist and no less weird but a tad more mainstream was the equally trippy Requiem for a Dream, well he's done it again and he is here to baffle us once more with the fountain. It's a film about a book that is the film and the book; oh forget it I can see I'm losing you already. Lets just say it's a very messed up love story that spans a thousand years and the universe and involves living forever but eventually dieing, am I making sense? Well the film hardly does either. Visually it is stunning as we fly through space and visit dieing stars, jumping backwards and forwards in our pursuit of answers to death, disease and eternal love, it all looks very pretty indeed its just that doesn't really help us understand it anymore. Science, fantasy, Mayan pyramids, yoga it all sounds a bit like Tom Cruise's belief system and yes at times it is that bizarre and just when you think there's going to be a revel or you've kind of got a handle on what the hells going off whoosh it spins of again into eating trees and self tattooing all while having flashback from several periods in history that are miles apart, am I losing you again? You see the thing is The Fountain is one of those films that you have to submerge yourself in; you have to live with it, feel it, and even become it. The first half of this review was written by me straight after seeing the film, this bit is nearly two weeks later and the film has taken that long to sink in, to imbed itself in my brain, it is a complex beast and one you will need time to tame. If people aren't getting it I guess they don't want to or its too much effort, where's the explosions and car chases? What is being presented here is a film with intelligence and a challenge to the audience if you go with it you will be rewarded if you don't you will miss out on one the most amazing cinematic experiences you could possibly have. I for one need to see it many more times to really appreciate its ultimate beauty. I have heard it being compared to 2001: A Space Odyssey and that is maybe stretching it but I can tell you it's not far off. A time spanning timeless masterpiece of modern cinema, a shame that people will probably not start getting it for years to come.",8.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
I have just come home from seeing this movie,"I have just read a previous opinion about this movie and I totally agree with the writer: you will hate or love this movie!! I don't prefer to say much about it; I just want to give advice that would have been good for me before I went to see it! My advice is to not pay too much attention to the previews of the movie, because you will get a very false picture of the movie and you will expect something different than what is really in the movie. I would have loved this move more without the previews. You will also find Hugh Jackman in a very different role than you have seen him before.

yup,"I totally agree with the last comment. The cinematography is truly splendid, full of golden dust-scattered stars and other such metaphors. I cried three times watching it; there was so much beauty and sadness. Most people are not going to get it. I overheard some ladies in our audience discussing 'The Fountain' afterward, and they clearly needed certain elements of the movie shoved down their throats. Thank goodness that Aronofsky does not do just that. Just to reiterate, the movie is indeed difficult, and because of this will undoubtedly be under appreciated for years. But if you come in with an open mind and quite uncertain what to expect, great things will occur.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
"Truly,  A Painting In  Motion","The Fountain (2006) directed by Darren Aronofsky is by far the most captivating, soul capturing, enigmatic movie of the year. For my friend and I that watched the movie together, the fantasy was too close to realism. The lessons that Tom (Hugh Jackman) went through with Izzy (Rachel Weisz) was painstakingly real. As presented in the trailer, three parallel stories intertwined with each other presenting innumerous metaphors and symbolisms. Once the story starts to slowly unravel, you are left with many questions in your head. For me, the questions still serve as an inspirational mystery that sustains the essence of the movie. If I say too much, then the peculiar depths of this movie will be ruined. Go see this movie with an open-mind, and leave a better person.Before watching The Fountain, my expectation of this movie was another Sci-Fi quest for knowledge, but the fragility of humanity presented in this movie has shattered my perspective. Portrayed by a desperate conquistador (Huge Jackman), and his beloved other-half (Rachel Weisz), you will see what great lengths of love they will cover (all depending on the vision you saw). If you appreciate life, go watch this fully elliptical ""painting in motion."" As for me, it is a movie I am destined to watch more than once. The cinematography, visual effects, and organic feel has taken my breath away. I waited a gruesome three months for this movie to come out (four years, but I have recently been endowed ever since the trailer), and once it came out, I was not disappointed at all, even to the last expectation.If you read my whole review, then you should watch The Fountain, then you will know my true perception of beauty, and this movie is it. Might I remind you that this movie is not for every audience. As confusing as it may seem (which in fact it is), you should thank Hollywood that this is not your ordinary cliché movie. And with no further a due, I leave you with the film: the 1500ad, the current, and the 2500ad, enjoy it.*** Truly deserved, 10 out of 10, the first ever in my life.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
god-awful,"If i wanted to look at ""art"" I'd go to a museum. This movie proves Aronofsky is a hack (Interesting that his upcoming film: flicker is about a hack film maker). Requiem was great because it was written by Hurbert Selby Jr. ""The Fountain"" however, was written by Aronofsky. Seems like he was trying to emulate David Lynch to me. This movie is filled with great special effects and stunning visuals, however, that is not enough to save this horrendous film. Where was the story? Did I miss it? For those people who claim this was a ""love story,"" well it was a pretty crappy one at that. I have a feeling we wont be seeing too much more from Aronofsky after this flops. Bottom line: This movie was boring. Not worth the wait.",1.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
a brilliant masterpiece,"sadly, this film is a primary example of the analogy of pearls to swine. everyone in the theatre except for my husband, my brother-in-law, and myself began ranting about how they wasted $8 for such a piece of crap as soon as the credits began to role... they complained about how it was nothing like the previews made it out to be (true) and how they didn't understand it. such simple minds miss the fact that sometimes the point is not understanding but simply inspiration. i wept through the end credits simply because i was so overcome by the sheer beauty of this piece. this is truly a masterpiece by a master. the acting is phenomenal. the imagery is incredible. and the story, though twisted and confusing, is absolutely beautiful. stylistically i would describe this as abstract work of surrealism, one of Hollywood's few 'art films.' sadly this is why it will not be well-accepted among average movie-goers. but those few of us who have the facilities to experience this masterpiece with every fiber of our existence will walk away having discovered a rare and priceless jewel in the midst of so much monotonous and mediocre recycled narratives, pyrotechnics, and pre-packaged bundles of myriad other Hollywood offerings. go see this refreshing work of heart and soul and be inspired.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"

The Mayan parts were inaccurate, which i could have ignored if the rest of the movie made up for it, but instead is decided to float along (those who have seen understand my wordage) and bore the hell out of me when i just wanted to see a love affair through the ages and celestial plains, not a self absorbed baldly explode after an annoyingly repetitive jaunt through his wasted existence.",1.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
Aronofsky the auteur,"In my mind, this film ranks at the top with giants such as 2001: A Space Odyssey and the Shining. It is cinematic excellence with its imagery, both visual and thematic, its cinematography and its inventive camera angles, shot sequences, and unique editing, its mesmerizing soundtrack full of classical but updated melody, its acting prowess: Hugh Jackman delivers an Academy Award winning performance as far as I can see, and Rachel Weisz is fantastic and incredibly believable. Most importantly, The Fountain is the vision of a true auteur director in the model of Stanley Kubrick himself. Aronofsky not only directs, but also has such a huge influence on the score and editing, and is responsible for writing these stories for the screen.But that's merely what make it a cinematic masterpiece, its story is an incredible blend of culture, philosophy, technology and science, and religion. But in line with what it means, for me, to be a great film, the story illuminates a variety of possible interpretations and hidden metaphors. This film, succinctly, is the magnum opus of a genius who might only be leaving us glimpses of his future potential. Truly, Death is the road to Awe.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
A meditation on mortality,"""Whenever a profound experience of change is about to take place, its harbinger is the motif of death. This is not particularly mysterious, since it is the limited view and appraisal of oneself that must be outgrown or transformed, and to accomplish transformation, the self image must dissolve.""- Lawrence E. SullivanFramed against the background of Mayan culture, its themes connected to the symbol of the Maya sacred tree, Darren Aronofsky's The Fountain conveys a simple message that may only become clear after a second or third viewing - that immortality cannot be won by living forever but is experienced only when one fully embraces death. This is what is meant in the film by Izzi Creo's often repeated refrain ""Finish it."" As author John Major Jenkins put it, ""The message is that the specter of death does not have to breed fear, it invites, rather, a meditation on mortality and a fuller appreciation for life.""Spanning thousands of years in the relationship between Thomas (Hugh Jackman) and his dying wife Izzy (Rachel Weisz) and wrapped in a complex visual tapestry, The Fountain interweaves three different temporal levels. Along the way, the film looks at the nature of death, the search for enlightenment, and whether our true essence is human or divine. In each story, there is a quest for immortality represented by the symbol of the Tree of Life or the Fountain of Youth, but it is only in the end that the basic truth about death is understood. It is a beautiful work of art that received little appreciation when it first came out but has grown in stature over the years.Film critic Joseph Belanger (Black Sheep Reviews) expressed the film's message in this way, ""Aronofsky attempts to show in an hour and a half that we as humans are not of our bodies but that the soul, life and love are eternal; that the death of our physical bodies is both a natural and necessary part of what we know as life; that we should neither fear it nor fight it but accept it as peacefully as possible."" The Fountain begins in 16th century Spain where a conquistador, Tomas is sent on a mission by Queen Isabella of Spain to find the Tree of Life in New Spain (South America) in order to stop an inquisitor named Silecio (Stephen McHattie) who is planning a coup against her.Tomas must fight hostile natives to reach the top of the temple, the high priest telling Tomas that ""death is the road to awe."" In the present day, Tommy Creo is a research doctor who is experimenting on a monkey, using the bark of a South American tree to desperately try to find a cure for his wife who is dying of a brain tumor. Thinking she is going to die soon, Izzi leaves Creo an unfinished manuscript for a book she has been writing called 'The Fountain"" about a conquistador's search for immortality in New Spain.Because she wants her husband to realize the futility of trying to save her life, she tells him to ""finish it."" Ultimately, Tommy finishes the book with the conquistador dying, completing the cycle of his own life. In the third sequence, Tom is a 26th century Astronaut grieving over the death of his wife. He is traveling in a space bubble as he transports the dying Tree of Life to a distant galaxy that the Mayans identified as Xibalba, the home of the dead awaiting reincarnation. It is a symbol of his acceptance of both his wife's death and his realization that we should not spend our days trying to avoid death, but embrace it as a lover.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
Quite possibly the most confusing movie every made,"I will keep it brief, despite my desire to write a full blown essay on this movie. I'm an avid movie goer (weekly) and have been for my entire life (in my 40's), without hesitation I say this is the most difficult to understand movie every made.I'm okay with being confused by a movie, even deep into the movie, but the responsibility is increasingly placed on the Director to clean it all up and tie the pieces together so that they make sense at the end. This movie attempts to tie the disparate pieces together at the end and utterly makes the mess even worse.Don't be fooled by anyone writing a review here that suggests that anything about this movie is good, other than the pure beauty of it and one or two particular scenes with Hugh Jackman that really indicate just how good of an actor he is.It is my opinion that a movie that has you shaking your head, considering leaving and requires this much constant thinking about what is going on, is not good entertainment.",1.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"

This is not one of those straight forward movies that doesn't require a lot of thought. If your looking for that, go watch Bond or something... This is a movie about life and how we as humans go about trying to understand it when it hits the stage of death. Now, I have to say that Hugh Jackman and Rachel Weis were INCREDIBLE!

The Fountain Is A Work Of Art In Every Sense Of The Word,"The Fountain, with the tag line, ""What if you could live forever?"" stars Hugh Jackman, Rachel Weisz and the incomparable Ellen Burstyn and is directed by Rachel's brilliant husband Darren Aronofsky (Requiem For A Dream). This absolute MUST SEE is now playing in Kingston, Ontario at The Screening Room. The Fountain is a Sci-Fi/Fantasy/Drama that is ultimately about the power of everlasting love  the film takes place over the course of 1,000 years within three parallel stories  but is also about life, death, life after death and the quest for the Fountain of Youth. It's intelligent, full of spiritual symbolism, visually stunning and emotionally devastating. You won't stop thinking about it for days.The immensely talented and handsome Aussie, Hugh Jackman (X-Men, Someone Like You, Swordfish, Kate & Leopold, Scoop, The Prestige), who has been in no less than six films this year, has never acted better. He made me cry with his performance as a doctor/scientist who is obsessed with finding a cure for death because his beloved wife is dying of a brain tumour. Hugh, in his triple roles as Tomas, Tommy and Tom Creo, was intense, heart wrenching and utterly believable and Academy Award winner Rachel Weisz (Best Supporting Actress for The Constant Gardener) nothing short of subtle perfection. This profound film is laden with luscious special effects and glimmering gold, black and white colours but never for a moment loses its heart and humanity.

In search of the cure for death,"Here's an original film.It takes place in three eras.In the modern era Research oncologist Tommy Creo (Hugh Jackman) is trying to find a cure for cancer.His wife he loves very much, Izzi (Rachel Weisz) is dying of that disease.In Spain during the 16th century Tomas (Jackman) is given the mission of finding the Tree of life.That's the same tree Adam and Eve had in the Garden of Eden.In the 25th century Tom the astronaut has kept himself young by compounds he produces from the tree's sap.The tree is inside his eccentric spacecraft he travels through the nebula with.His only wish is to see Izzi again.She appears to him in the visions where she encourages him to finish writing her book, The Fountain.Darren Aronofsky has done a lot of good during his career that hasn't lasted so long yet.He's the director and writer of The Fountain.This project took a long time for him to finish and when he finally did this is the result.Something really good.It's a fantastic mixture of romance and Sci-fi.Hugh Jackman does perfect job in the lead as those three men of different times.He lost all his hair for the future period but it was all worth it.Rachel Weisz' work as Izzi and Queen Isabel is extraordinary.The beauty and talent are very well combined in one person.Ellen Burstyn is wonderful as Dr.Lillian Guzetti.Mark Margolis plays Father Avila and he's great.And so is Ethan Suplee as Manny.The Fountain is a groundbreaking film experience.The word beautiful would be the best to describe this movie.It's highly touching in many places.This is not a happy film.It's not also one of the easiest films in the world.Nevertheless The Fountain is a groundbreaking film experience.It's something that will blow your mind.",9.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"

Not having read any of the reviews before watching the movie, at first I was puzzled on the true meaning of the story, then the second time I watched it, I was able to appreciate the finer details and spiritual meaning of the story. The representation of death in the film is exactly as it should be, heroic, courageous, absorbing, enlightening. If anyone wants to ponder over existence and be able to face the inevitable, then watch this film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
Arguably one of the worst films ever,"Dire, abysmal, dull, confusing, awful, etc etc. I could use just about every synonym for the foregoing comments in the entire Roget's Thesaurus and still not quantify just how bad this film is. In fact, so confusing is this story that I suspect that some crazed editor simply patched three films together in a random fashion. This has absolutely no saving graces at all and represented a waste of 3 hours of my life (I watched it twice simply to be fair and see if I was being overly critical after the first viewing, but no, it's still awful) I can well understand why Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett pulled out of this. Maybe the Mystery Science Theater 3000 people will do something great with this in the future.",1.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
Awesome and underrated movie,"This is a true work of art... And it is very hard to describe.First point, the movie is gorgeous. Every still frame in this is a pleasure to watch. The colors are strange but good looking. At this point even if you don't understand anything to the story, the movie would be worth watching as it is a pleasure to the eyes.For the story, it's a bit hard to understand. You must not switch off your brain a minute during the movie or you may end up with an incomplete story. It would be sad !This is a very imaginative work combining three stories spanning three different historical period. And yet, those three stories are related in a way you'll discover as the movie unfolds.It combines religion, mythology, science fiction and love in the same story. If I would explain you that story right here, you would think that the author of Requiem for a Dream has taken too much drugs. Don't pay attention to what people are saying about this story, it's impossible to do it justice with words. Go to the nearest theater or DVD shop and see this movie.It may seems a bit pretentious at times. Right ! But the result is really awesome. We had not seen anything that ambitious since Stanley Kubrick's 2001 ! Is it as good as 2001 ? Time with tell.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
Right down awful,"Whatever idiot's life was forever change by this motion picture would of course be the idiot that was blown away by Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. Both movies are as pointless and artfully pretentious as the last. There is one exception: The Fountain is exponentially as pointless and a billion times less watchable.If you really must see a bald Hugh Jackman flying through space in the Lotus position while backlit in gold lighting, this is definitely your movie. For those of us with a brain who wonder what the hell is going on, you'll probably want to skip this one.I believe the point it took 1 hour and 42 painful minutes to make is one that a five year old is made familiar with when they're taught the rain cycle. Excuse me if I don't find the artful expression of the obvious as earhshattering as those with the need to feel culturally superior. I think I'd rather sit through a re-run of the Simpsons for the 42nd time. Horrible, horrible movie.",1.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
"Beautiful, sad and complex","This is one of those movies where once I finished it I wasn't able to talk about it except to say that it's one of the most beautiful and sad movies I have ever seen.There are lots of negative reviews for this movie, and I can understand why. It seems like nowadays movies should leave one with a neat package with all the answers when the credits roll at the end, and this movie is not like that at all. There is no plot exposition in the movie, no explanation, no free ride. One has to work through the movie, the acting, the symbols and make up his own mind. The images are beautiful, the story is heartbreaking, and the pacing while slow is simply perfect.So if you are looking to spend an hour and a half watching pretty visuals and to end up with an easy explanation for what you have just seen, do not watch this movie, it will frustrate you. But if you want to watch a beautiful parable about life, love and death and are not adverse to actually thinking while watching a movie, watch this, it will leave you speechless. This is a classic that will still be watched for years to come by those who enjoy intelligent cinema.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
Transcends the medium,"Darren Aronofsky proves his immeasurable talent by making a film like The Fountain. It is such a large departure from what we normally expect from the auteur, and yet the results are still incredible. The Fountain is a film that spans three time periods and one man's quest for eternal youth and love through each time period. It is essentially three parallel stories, spanning one thousand years, that deal with love and death and our fragile existence in this world. The film is something that can only be grasped by watching it and no synopsis could do it justice, so I'll just move on.The Fountain demands a certain sophistication while watching in order to understand. There isn't much to grab on to and little is explained as the film progresses. You have to keep up with and even interpret events as they occur in order to get the most out of the film. It's a film that is so far out there that I think only Aronofsky himself can fully understand it all, but what we can make out of it is still satisfying to the mind and soul. I was entranced by this film and trying to keep up with it all wasn't a burden, but an adventure that transcended the cinematic medium and pulled me into the film in a way few films are able to do. I was personally mystified and awestruck by this glorious film loving every minute of its bizarre nuances.However, it really all comes down to the audio visual experience which The Fountain is at heart. The highly original and overwhelming beauty of the film makes it one of a kind and extremely gripping. Clint Mansell scores the film beautifully, as is to be expected from the man who scored the all too memorable Requiem for a Dream theme. But these two elements weave together so perfectly that The Fountain becomes an experience unlike any other. It is something so original and so magnificent that I could hardly take my eyes off the screen. This isn't just a film, it's pure magic in the most glorious and shining fashion imaginable.It takes some effort to enjoy The Fountain, but if you give the film the benefit of the doubt then things will come together and you will end up with a very satisfying and empowering experience. This is such a strikingly beautiful film that is filled with great moments and moving scenes. Hugh Jackman and Rachel Weisz are incredible and they highlight all of the moments where the intense visuals aren't as relevant. If you enjoy bizarre and highly original films then you should love The Fountain. It is a truly astounding film that only some of us can appreciate and fall in love with.",9.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
Absolutely Wonderful,"After watching this I have to say that the Fountain movie is one of my favourite ever! It's the most influential movie for me since the deerhunter. The visual effects are simply amazing and charming, I'm still seeing some images of them in my dreams! That's a perfect movie for everyone who loves really good and deep movies. The themes of life, death, love, good and bad, dedication and kindness really make you think about what you've already done in your life and what you should do i future Not to say Hugh Jackman and Rachel Weize are absolutely great in this movie. Darron Aronofsky once again showed he's one of the best directors ever!",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
Great film to talk about if you want to appear cultured and smart!!!!,"Exactly what i said in the title....pretentious crap. in reality it wastes too much time explaining nothing and giving us grand visual effects instead of telling a story, be it non-linear, linear, upside down, or up in the bum. this is a college film students version of a lethal weapon movie...all special effects and no substance. even the actors, as great as those two are, seemed to be a bit confused at times. So i chalk this movie up as one of those films that is in reality a pile of garbage, but will live on as a ""great piece of work"", due to all the wanna be film school students trying to look as if they understand grand ideas common folk do not. but honestly, if a well known film director put out 2.5 hours of a toilet, someone would call that art as well...and then claim we just didn't ""get it"". I feel like watching a real lethal weapon movie now haha...gotta love mel Gibson.-bob",1.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
The Fountain is a masterpiece of raw emotion,"Without giving anything away, I would just like everyone to know what to expect from this movie. You can't go into this movie expecting a standard. You must go into with your mind and your heart open. Let it work its magic on you. You will be rewarded with a mind-blowing excursion into human nature and probably your own psyche.Darren Aronofsky has compiled a masterpiece that examines the themes of life, love, death, and rebirth. It is difficult not to identify with Tommy Creo, and you spend the entire film feeling everything Tommy feels.The spiritual journey is portrayed by amazing cinematography, and very little (if any) CG work. Instead, Aronofsky utilized macro photography to represent outer space, which was not only visually stunning but symbolically important (i.e., you can see infinity even in the smallest particles, and you can see the divine by looking inward). The entire film was accompanied by Clint Mansell and the Kronos Quartet, who delivered a spot-on performance by exaggerating every emotion.In short, this film was beautiful and thought-provoking. Some have referred to it as ""poetry on film"", and I quite agree.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
A Very Good Film For Movie Buffs,"I happen to be an avid movie watcher and have an extensive DVD library. Thus I look for a movie to suit my mood. There are times for easy entertainment such as SpiderMan, Mr and Mrs Smith, and then there are times for a movie like this. If you read the comments you will hear plenty of people who complained and hated this film. I can see that, IF you are expecting easy entertainment.This movie has many similarities in style to What Dreams May Come, The Final Cut, or The Butterfly Effect. If you are in the mood for something deeper and out of the norm then this is a movie for you.A word of advice if you are going to watch this movie make sure you have a quiet moment with no distractions. It is intensive as Blood Diamonds and requires paying close attention.So in the end I liked this movie quite a bit.",9.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
A Fountain of Artistic Mastery,"Aronofsky is an artist, and ""The Fountain"" is his latest masterpiece. It's a work of art and a film at the same time, and the art element of it deserves a perfect score, while the film aspect deserves probably an eight star score.""The Fountain"" tells three parallel stories in no particular order, often melding them together. The core story is the tale of Tommy (Hugh Jackman), a determined scientist who tries desperately to find a cure for his wife Izzy (Rachel Weisz), who has a serious case of cancer. Izzy is almost finished writing a novel called ""The Fountain."" the plot of this novel is the second story, which takes place in Span in the 1500s, and chronicles the journey of a conquistador named Tomas (Jackman) to find the Fountain of Youth. He does this in the service of the lovely Queen Isabella (Weisz). The last story takes place in the distant future, in which an astronaut (Jackman) journeys to the dying star Xi'balba in a bubble in an attempt to save the lovely dying tree that inhabits the bubble alongside him.Jackman is very restrained in his three roles, but he still gives a very solid and realistic performance. He allows the audience to tune in on hi desperation and feel it with him. Weisz is beautiful and puts in a grade-A performance, selling us with her irresistible charm and tangible affection. Still, the real star of the film is the look and feel.The visual effects used in the space scenes are beautiful and entrancing. The subtle ones used in the other two stories are not at all cheesy, but rather express the desired feelings of the characters. The art direction and set direction are breath-takingly gorgeous. The set pieces are all masterworks in themselves, and the nature scenes and bubble sequences are beautiful as well. The entire film is rich in earthy colors which complement the themes in the film well. Aronofsky also includes minor motifs everywhere.This film is beautiful and amazing. The plots are brilliantly rendered, the sets are amazing, and the effects are very good. This is a great film that is also incredibly deep and insightful.",9.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
uggh! so drawn out,"Bottom line is.. if you want art go to a museum. This is just a very long look at the same painting, just from 3 different sides. But don't take my word for it, just remember, you'll use up time better spent watching paint dry.",1.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
Visually Stunning!!,"I didn't go see this in the theater, but now I wish I did. Its visually stunning! So many of the scenes look like paintings that you would see at an art exhibit. Sometimes I almost lost track of the story because I was just looking at the visuals and listening to the wonderful score. It also has great acting, Jackman and Weisz both give great performances as they portray their different characters throughout the film. Another thing that helped me enjoy the film was its direction and pacing. Some directors might have stretched the runtime out longer to make it seem more ""epic"", but I think the shorter length actually helps this movie out a lot. He focuses more on the main characters instead of chasing pointless subplots that just add length. This is an amazing film that hasn't got the credit and attention that it deserves! Aronofsky is setting himself up to be one of the great filmmakers of his generation.",9.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
There are no words...,"The best movie I have ever seen! I will not even attempt to praise it for fear that words would not capture the essence of this film. However, because I need to fill up 10 lines worth of space, I can attempt to justify the film. A beautiful experience; like living, breathing art. Each scene is exquisitely beautiful. I have never left a film feeling so content; so satisfied. The actors were wonderful and Rachel's performance was, as always, beautiful. The film requires no explanation. I look forward to watching this film again and again! Thank you Mr. Aronofsky! This film will, of course, not be appreciated the way it should be and that is a damn shame because the film is fantastic!",,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
"Haunting, soulful, beautiful","See this movie If you are a fan of non linear stories you have to concentrate on and work out your own meaning to, see it if you want to feel something, see it for the beautiful cinematography and the exquisite score, see it for the chemistry between two incredible actors performing at the very top of their game, see it as a meditation on love and loss. Just see it",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
Save your money!,"This was a very difficult movie to follow. I love thought-provoking films but this isn't one of them.I assumed that movie goers would be challenged to think outside the box, but I couldn't seem to find the box!The concept or theory of everlasting life is an intriguing one and one that the previews of The Fountain suggested would keep your attention. The previews were much better than the movie itself.While the graphics and cinematic presentations were 7 out of 10, the movie never got off the ground in establishing any realism.The supporting characters were never really introduced. There was very little interaction with anyone other than the leading actor and actress.I did not find this film entertaining. I was very disappointed.",3.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
A Very Botanical Love Story,"The movie starts off kind of slow, looking low budget and sketchy. But after just a few scenes, the story, absorbing characters and mesmerizing visuals take over and it becomes riveting to watch.The people decrying it as nonsense clearly have never felt true love. Mushy, yes, but true.The movie unwaveringly depicts the lengths to which men go to reconcile their love. With seamless allegories depicting courtship, faith, marriage and growing old together, the movie draws out just how it is that one half of the species feels about their other half.The story is even further-reaching, branching out over the cycle of life, mortality and responsibility, the ease of how the fragility of life can be crushed by overzealousness.Every frame of cinematography looks marvelously crafted and the script doesn't let up but continues to build with poignancy until the zen-like climax of the ending which ties together all the seams to give a brilliant sense of closure and thoughtful insight.Very highly recommended for everyone to see at least once, because even if it doesn't leave the viewer with a favourable impression, it will leave them thinking and questioning.",9.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
From strength to strength,"After a couple of years of anticipation i finally had the chance to watch The Fountain,and not only was i not disappointed i was blown away! To all those people who have spoken out against it, saying the 3 toms intertwining doesn't work must watch the film again. On the second outing you see where the director was coming from as the film on the first outing has so much to take in! The whole texture to the film is like a sculpture created by an artist,and the music just adds to the poetry. Whether you love or hate this film,you can't deny it will have an effect on you good or bad after leaving the cinema. Darren Aronofski had to put a difficult subject matter onto screen where other directors would of played it safe,for that i tip my cap off to him.",8.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
