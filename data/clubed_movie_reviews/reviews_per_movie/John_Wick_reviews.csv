Keanu gets pissed and shoots people in the face for 101 minutes*,"John wick has a very simple revenge story. It can be summarized as ""Keanu gets angry and shoots bad guys"" but what makes it special? Directed by Chad Stahelski who's a stunt specialist boy does it show because the main selling point in the film are some real virtuoso action sequences, well made choreographies. Unlike today's action movies, it doesn't use quick-cuts or shaky cameras actually see what's going on.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
Story: 3 minutes; Entertainment: 101 minutes.,"It looks as if the filmmakers realized that the public was sick of certain movies. Most movies nowadays are full of wire work, sci-fi, etc. often topped with icing made of needless or predictable background stories that add nothing. For example the beautiful girlfriend who gives the moral speeches or the troubled teenage daughter, who aren't present here.Nothing of that is in John Wick. John Wick adds hardly a story, no character development, no needless character or background, no misplaced drama, no misplaced humor and not too much eye candy, nothing of that. What John Wick offers is action, action and more action. In fact, it is one long action scene, with some lines and close ups added. But that is not a problem. The directors promise action and deliver. While delivering they made it look good and convincing, without trying to be more, and they're smart enough to give the movie a satisfying beginning and ending.And for those who claim that Keanu Reeves is a horrible actor..... you are right. But his blank expression is perfect for this movie. Leave the acting to the bad guys and the delicious guest part for Willem Dafoe.If you're tired of movies with forced drama or loaded with CGI, John Wick will be a pleasant wake-up call.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
The best action revenge film of all time from 2014 so far!,"John Wick (2014) is the best revenge flick from Keanu Reeves of 2014 from The Matrix (1999) to John Wick (2014) another action fast paced, Entertaining slick action packed film, which kind I have never seen before. It is a very fun, straightforward action movie with an 80's sensibility. It's nice to see Keanu doing these types of roles again. It is one of my personal favorite Keanu Reeves movies. Keanu Reeves is a bad ass what a great action packed blood packed film. Movies should really learn from this on how to make a decent action film, especially with the crap we are getting today like escape plan bullet to the head and such. This film to me is the greatest action film to come out in this century. Keanu was phenomenal the action was so fast paced and exciting my jaw literally dropped as Keanu took out all the bad guys! I personally think this film is better then all Taken films combined. It was simply brilliant, it was made for 20 million dollars and I am glad it made 40 million in the US. I think this film deserved to make 100 million!Old school action with no shaky cam. Definitely the best stunt-man-turned-director-debut I've ever seen. The story is set about John Wick (Keanu Reeves) a retired assassin, who gets dragged back into his field when the Russian Mob put a hit out on him, but instead of killing John, they steal his classic Mustang and kill his newly acquired puppy. This sets John out to exact revenge on the whole mob in a no nonsense kind of way...multiple shots to the chest and one to the head for good measure type of justice. I've never seen a film where the gun play is this to the point and precise as this. I don't know what the body count is, but it's gotta be up there...way up there. Oh...and another thing...they actually reload the guns. Don't see that that often in films. It's got an all star cast of cameo/small roll characters, from Ian McShane, William Dafoe, and John Leguizamo, and I swear one of the bad guy henchman is that ""Mayhem"" Insurance guy. One of the Best Movie, that Keanu Reeves ever made. From start to finish. Non stop action, all scenes look very realistic. ( The best action movie of the year. )I Love this movie so much I think the people behind this movie made a great astonish action movie. There are other things in the movie that I love so much. I even think John Wick is so much better than 47 Ronin (2013) that Keanu Reeves made. The most that I love in this movie is Adrianne Palicki as Ms. Perkins I think she did one of the best job portraying and playing the most memorable female assassin I have ever seen. Ms. Perkins made me realized and inspired me that there are a lot of women who choose occupation as a female assassin hired by the mob. There were a lot of female actresses who played an assassin but I have never see any women portrayed like that. Adrianne Palicki is a bad ass! She even played Lady Jaye in the G.I. Joe Team's covert operations a specialist in the movie G.I. Joe: Retaliation (2013) one of my favorite movies. The fight sequence between John Wick and Viggo Tarasov is real and very realistic I did not see any CGI in it. This wouldn't be an action movie without some action. There's plenty of it, and it's perfectly done. The The stunts are completely insane in scale. There is a lot of gun play and powder even the guys reload guns. There are even Daniel Bernhardt from Bloodsport II and The Matrix Reloaded in it. And he was perfect in here and the fight scenes with Keanu Reeves were well done by him. This is the first time In the movie I see Willem Dafoe been the good guy. I haven't seen him in decades playing the good guy since Platoon (1986) my favorite Vietnam war movie!The last thing about the movie I want to say that John Wick was a dog lover and I love dogs. I love how he avenge the puppy's death by mobsters who killed him and than he saved another puppy from the animal shelter when he was wounded. He wasn't a superhero without any bruises on him he was wounded. Keanu Reeves did a wonderful job better than he did in Knock Knock (2015) I only hope they want screwed up the sequel and making much better action movie than the first was.When sadistic young thugs senselessly attack John Wick (Keanu Reeves)-a brilliantly lethal ex-assassin-they have no idea they've messed with the wrong guy. With New York City as his bullet-riddled playground, Wick embarks on a merciless rampage, hunting down his adversaries with the skill and ruthlessness that made him an underworld legend That is the main plot the rating I am giving this movie is a 10/10 because It deserves it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
delivers if taken for what it is,"Though he no longer has a taste for wet work, retired assassin and ""Boogeyman"" John Wick has suffered a personal tragedy that's left a huge void in his life. When he and his dog (really the last meaningful thing he has left) fall victim to a scummy group of Russian mobsters, he emerges from his shell with vengeance on his mind. Slow and ambiguous at first, but reveals more as it goes along, and once it kicks into gear it rarely lets up with plenty of stylized, visceral action scenes, an impressive arsenal of weaponry, plus sly direction and editing that give it the feel of a violent music video at times. Preposterously fun to watch, it just doesn't have much of a story at its disposal, not to mention all the over-the-top bloodletting and mayhem eventually becomes redundant. Savvy, indestructible Reeves looks right at home, and delivers many of his lines with a sardonic wit. **½",,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
I Don't Get It,"I really don't understand the love that ""John Wick"" receives. It's just kind of a generic action thriller to me. No different than a ""Bourne"" or ""Taken"" movie. It gets a slight bump for me in a rating of 6 instead of 5 because I did think that the cinematography was really good and also the fight choreography was top notch. I can definitely see the influence of martial arts films on this.As for the story, it's basically not there. What's worse is the fact that the movie goes out of its way to constantly remind you that John Wick (Keanu Reeves) as a character is someone who is incredibly lethal and dangerous and feared by criminals. In my opinion, this completely kills whatever dramatic weight the cheesy storyline that ""they killed my dog and stole my car"" plot has to begin with.I guess people liked it well enough because it's got three sequels and more to come. Personally I don't think it's any better than the average Netflix Original action movie. Huge skip in my opinion.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
Manly action film,"Lesson learned: don't get on retired legendary hit-man John Wick's bad side. In the film of the same name, he goes back into action shooting up bad guys in a city where it seems that the cops have all simultaneously taken a vacation. Played by surprisingly youthful quinquagenarian Keanu Reeves, John Wick's style of shooting baddies is reminiscent of my days playing Whac-A-Mole, Duck Hunt, or any of those arcade games with the plastic guns. Wick is a vengeant superman, and this is the basis of the entire movie. Although he doesn't have a clear weakness that can be exploited like most heroes, Wick does get into enough trouble for the audience to be sincerely worried about him.If you're planning on seeing John Wick because you like movies with clever or meaningful story lines, then you're going to be disappointed. If you are looking for raw well- choreographed action and machismo, then look no further. House Greyjoy's Alfie Allen stands out as villainous Russian mafia brat Iosef Tarasov, and Michael Nyqvist (Girl with the Dragon Tattoo) plays Viggo, his mob boss father. Adrianne Palicki, Willem Dafoe, Ian McShane and Dean Winters round out a strong supporting cast.Overall, I enjoyed John Wick as a pure action film. It doesn't have a storyline like The Matrix or Speed, but it was visually entertaining and the simplicity of the story allowed for appreciation of the action. This movie is manly and primitive, and proves that at the age of 50, Keanu Reeves can still mix it up as an action star.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
I'm Thinking I'm Back,"John Wick is one of those few movies a year that seemed like it would be absolutely terrible, but when you finally sit down and watch it, turns out to be incredible. Not only is it one of the most fun films of the year, but it's so much different than the action films we have today. It doesn't try to be inventive or over-the-top, it just plays to it's strengths.I have never been a huge fan of Keanu Reeves. Even in The Matrix, which is a great film, his acting falls pretty flat to me. He hasn't showed me anything that can make him a true thespian on screen. But as John Wick, he's perfect. The role doesn't call for anything more than just being a likable bada**. Wick is a man dealing with the death of his wife and retirement of his past associations with assassins of sort. He finally feels like he get's closure with his wife and then it's all ripped away from him by the very gangsters he was once affiliated with. He goes on an absolute killing rampage. To say the body count adds up is an understatement. Wick goes to great lengths to find the people who took everything from him, but it's not exactly easy for him. Being someone who just came out of retirement means you may be a little rusty, well Wick is definitely that. That's one of the many things I appreciated about this film. It never seemed like he was blowing through these guys without danger. Sure he effortlessly kills plenty, but he also struggles with a few as well.Killing a cute little dog would tick off anyone, so I don't blame the character for being mad, but I'm not sure there needed to be this many deaths. There are plenty of innocent security guards who die at the hands of Wick. At times, it just felt like a little too much for a revenge film. But I really loved all of John's interactions with people from his past. They all seem to be as surprised that Wick is killing again, as we are that this film turned out to be good. I thought it was a nice touch that the police officer simply let the fact that there were a bunch of dead people in Wick's apartment, go. Alfie Allen plays the main villain, and it seemed as though his storyline is very similar to that of Game of Thrones. He's constantly under-appreciated and so he wants to prove himself, but ends up doing something terribly stupid. It was also nice to see Bridget Regan from Agent Carter briefly pop up.But besides the fact that the script was pretty weak and the body count was pretty high, the film is just awesome. The 'Drive' sounding music and score to go along with the breathtaking action sequences made for one helluva ride. Keanu Reeves should stick to these less demanding and fun action roles.

8/10,"The only word that keeps coming back to mind when reviewing this movie is: exhilarating. The fun factor this amazing action film has is probably the highest of any movie this year. I could not stop myself from having a blast!First and foremost, being also the first thing you notice, ""John Wick"" is self-conscious of what it is and doesn't, for not even one second, take itself more seriously than it should. Fortunately this doesn't shut out the place for character connection and empathy. People often think the two of these things exclude themselves, but that is not what I think and this movie is proof of it. It has such a genuine sense of fun and humor, so much so that you are often laughing WITH (not AT) the movie at the preposterousness of everything and at the same time feeling genuine tension for the characters you're rooting for. I know it sounds ridiculous, but every single f***ing kill by John Wick feels exciting and liberating, it was incredible how much I was rooting for him. To this contributes some stunning, fast-and-furious level action scenes that benefit amazingly by the practicality involved. Hats off to the director and the special effects guys for staging such a flawless string of adrenaline-pumping scenes, in particular to the director for the highly energetically stylish direction that never feels as a gimmick or out of place, yet instead makes everything all the more enjoyable. Furthermore this is one of the few movies in which sound actually stood out and contributed in making the film a great success. Keanu Reeves is perfect for the role and brings to the screen so much charisma I could not help but root for the guy. He is surrounded by a great cast too that has very fun moments on their own. If all of this wasn't enough, ""John Wick"" has some great original ideas and plays with them in the best way possible.Despite having a blast in the theater and wanting to maybe see this movie again in a year or so, it isn't original, stylish or innovative enough to say: ""we've seen this plot before, but not quite done this way"". Yes it has its brilliance, but it is kind of cheesy, even if in a good way, and predictable. It doesn't rank up to a higher standard of action movie because of its straight-forwardness. It does have some stakes, but all in all there isn't really an overwhelming set piece or twist that makes it highly remarkable.Obviously, that is not what it's aiming for and because of that I could recommend this movie to anybody, just go and have the best action entertainment fun in the theater!",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
Most Excellent,"Wow what a great surprise this was. I was told by a friend this was good but it's been awhile since I liked a Keanu movie so I was hesitant to try it. Retired hit-man John Wick (Keanu Reeves) loses his wife to cancer. After her funeral he receives a puppy she left him. A few days later some thugs, led by the son of a Russian gangster John used to work for, break into John's house. They beat him up, take the keys to his beloved car, and kill the puppy. They did this not knowing who he was; they just wanted the car. Now John Wick is out for revenge and the Russian gangster is trying to save his son's life by sending killers after John.Keanu's great here. Glad to see him doing something watchable again. Willem Dafoe, Alfie Allen, Ian McShane, and Lance Reddick lead a good supporting cast. Michael Nyqvist was made to play villains. Even Adrianne Palicki was good. Oh and hey the beat-up guy from the Allstate commercials is in this. The stuff with the hotel for assassins and the way they all know each other was pretty funny. About the only problem I had with it was the unrealistic scene where the bad guy finally gets the upper hand on the 'hero' and doesn't kill him. This sort of thing is common in movies but it's always unbelievable and reminds me of the old James Bond villains. This is easily the best action movie this year. Possibly the best straight action movie since the first Taken. English-speaking action movies, that is. It doesn't reinvent the genre or anything but it's entertaining.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
You don't mess with another person's dog. It's as simple as that!,"With the fourth installment scoring immensely at the cinemas as I'm submitting this review, and after three previous films that are apparently loved by everyone else in the world, I thought perhaps it would be time for me check out ""John Wick"".But, even though I'm late to the party as usual, I don't feel like I've missed out on a lot. ""John Wick"" is a fast-paced and adrenaline-rushing action flick, but not the traditional type of action movie, like ""Die Hard"" or ""Lethal Weapon"". Since a good fifteen years or so, there seemingly exists an additional new sub-genre within the world of action/thriller cinema, which is best described as ""Shoot 'em Up"" films, and ""John Wick"" neatly fits into this category. Other examples include ""Shoot 'em Up"", - duh - , ""Crank"", ""Hardcore Henry"", ""Free Fire"", ""Taken"" and ""Everly"". You guessed it; - these are films with very thin plots and without any proper character development, but they primarily focus on non-stop violent action, excessively over-the-top gunfire action and a practically immeasurable body count. They are entertaining if you're in a completely undemanding mood, I reckon, but they are quite unmemorable as well. Moreover, despite all the action and bloodshed, these films are sort of boring, because they constantly repeat the same old ""bang-bang-you're-all-dead"" routine.The most interesting aspects about ""John Wick"" are definitely the structural framework and background stories the script constantly hints at. The rudimentary plot of an invincible and stoic hitman coming out of retirement to extract vengeance of a personal nature is really old and has been told hundreds of times before. The organization in which our protagonist operates, however, is intriguing to say the least. He knows everyone, both the ones supporting him and the ones he's shooting up, there's a sort of code of conduct that includes the use of specific coins and the respect of neutral zones, the cleaning up bloody shootout aftermaths is referred to as diner reservations, and even the local law enforcer doesn't seem surprised when John answers the door with a bloodied face. None of these particularities ever get explained, but then again, there are at least three more films.The sole thing to bear in mind when watching a film like ""John Wick"" remains: don't ask yourself any questions. Where does the never-ending supply of redundant henchmen keeps coming from? Why can't anyone hit a target expect for the hero? Why engage into a fistfight when there's a possibility for a clean shot? Why capture your target instead of killing him straight away, for that matter? You know he'll just escape again and kill you instead. Most importantly, why didn't anyone at least try to apologize to Wick for murdering his puppy?If you seek logic and answers to these questions, ""John Wick"" is a terrible film. In case you accept what it is, there's entertainment aplenty thanks to the impressive stunt work, the solid performances by Keanu Reeves and the supportive cast, inventive little gimmicks, and a whole lot of mean people that get punished for making the wrong career choices in their lives.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"

Keanu Brings a quiet believability to this action throwback,"John Wick had been out awhile and at first I had little interest in seeing it as, for me, Keanu Reeves is generally whatever the opposite of a selling point is. However I kept hearing about how this was a bit of a throw back of an action movie and upon reading the connection between the director and Keanu, I thought I would have to put aside my preconceived notions and give this movie a shot.The movie had two ex-stunt men (one of which was Keanu Reeves' former stunt double) helming this film. This resulted in a lot of practical effects instead of heavy reliance on green screen. Also familiarity with Reeves likely left the directors with a base knowledge with how far they could push the star. This left the film's action scenes clean, realistic, to the point, and a hell of a lot of fun to watch.If I was going to break down the film's format, well it is of the ""semi-generic Punisher type, ex bad ass comes out of retirement to take on other bad asses"" type variety. It was 75% Japanese yakuza film, 20% Film Noir, and 5% video game. One stylistic element that jumped out at me right away was the choice to go with a narrow scope of field for focus. At first I thought maybe this was the projector in the theater but then I realized it was a choice made for the film. Normally this would annoy me slightly, and I suppose still did, as I am a big fan of depth of field, mise–en–scènes set ups (Citizen Kane is one of my favorite films). I came to terms with the stylistic choice made for this film as it reminded me so much of Eastern influences, in this case it was reminiscent of Zen ink and brush compositions, where the sharpness lies in where the brush first touches down and the edges disappear into an almost mist like effect.While Keanu sold the action pieces well, he wasn't asked to do too much to stretch his stoic emotional range, which is just what the film required. He was pretty much perfect for this part if I had been for some reason been asked to recast this film, I would be hard pressed to find a better fit. This would have been right up Jason Statham's alley, however there is nothing more he could have added to it. There was something quietly instance about Reeves that made you feel that he was one not to be trifled with. Statham will always remind me of the character he played in Snatch, which was not at all overly menacing or intimidating. Rather, if I had my choice of an alternative, I would delve further into the Japanese gangster genre and extract Chow Yun-fat. Reeves was 49 in this film and still convincing as an ass kicker. Chow Yun-fat would have been ten years older, but that would have further added to the realism of a retired hit man that is unwillingly dragged back into the 'business'.Speaking of performances, this film was full of great character actors from the action genre and otherwise. One of these performances that I was not overly fond of was that of Alfie Allen. You probably know him as the dickless Theon Greyjoy. He worked in the part in that he was highly unlikable, however I was not sure which accent he was trying to commit to. This brings me to another flaw of the film. Many of the baddies simply did not measure up to be worthy of the John Wick challenge. A spoiled brat son of a crime boss nor the crime boss himself, an old man that the film gave no hint as to any physical prowess until the anticlimactic final battle gave any feeling that the fight would go any other direction except to a single minded John Wick killing stroke.I highly recommend this film if you are a fan of good action. This easily ranks as one of the pure action movies of 2014. Judged as just a movie, it is simple in story structure, but what it does it does very well.Blarv Score out of 10: 8.8",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
Smoothest action film to come around in a long time,"John Wick is something special. It takes as much time setting up elaborate action sequences as it does the world with which it all takes place in. And what a world it is. It reminds me of Millers Crossing and it is cooler than any other recent attempt at noir. We are shown a criminal underworld where, if you are connected, many powerful people know who you are and show you respect. John Wick was connected but he got out. He is the rare killer who has found peace, and he is grateful for that peace. Some young kids steal that from him and he does what he does best, he wages a one man war against the Russian Mafia. It might sound like the film takes quite a leap but it all makes sense. The motives of John and the people who get in the way of his bullets are all very clear, even if it does come across as rather simple. That's the plot at it's most basic. Then there's the action. The film is directed by Reeve's stuntman from The Matrix, so this guy knows action. There are sequences that flow so smoothly it puts other action films and their quick cuts to shame. Keaunu moves so fluidly throughout the film and comes across as such a natural that the only disappointment is that we have not seen him like this before. Along the way are plenty of character actors, fans of The Matrix and The Wire will recognize a few people then there are more obvious ones like Ian McShane and Willem Dafoe. Everyone seems to be having a good time. That is another plus for this movie. It get's dark at times but overall it is quite fun, not very chipper, but fun. I cannot recommend this movie enough. I believe it is a must see for action fans and for anyone looking for something a bit different from the usual fare.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
Action as it should be,"JOHN WICK is a rare example of Hollywood getting things spot-on when it comes to creating the near-perfect action film. JOHN WICK is a relentless, pulse-pounding thriller that has plenty of similarity to the Liam Neeson classic TAKEN, albeit with a more simplistic (and also more emotionally intense) plot line. This is the kind of lean, pared-down film-making that's all about intensity and momentum. It sits well with classic international fare like POINT BLANK, SLEEPLESS NIGHT, MEA CULPA, THE MAN FROM NOWHERE, and THE RAID films.JOHN WICK isn't a perfect film; some of the dialogue is sloppily, some of the writing is too broad, and occasionally the music is intrusive. However, when it gets things right, as it frequently does, you can forgive all of these minor niggles and sit back and enjoy the ride. The clever decision was made to employ a martial arts expert as director, so the emphasis is on realistic, superbly choreographed action sequences, and they're hard-hitting and plentiful. The nightclub set-piece is the obvious highlight, but nearly all of the action here is spectacular.Keanu Reeves has been in lots of average or overrated films over the years but this stands as one of his very best, alongside SPEED. His dry, laconic turn is light years ahead of his other recent action flick, MAN OF TAI CHI. The supporting cast is basically unnecessary, but Michael Nyqvist, Willem Dafoe, and Alfie Allen all put in decent turns. In the end, though, JOHN WICK is all about the action, and quite simply it rocks. Bring on the sequel!",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"

Probably NOT a film to watch with your kids or mother.,"When the story begins, John (Keanu Reeves) has just lost his wife. After her death, he's a bit lost but tries to rebuild his life. One day, he's getting gas and a young Russian-American punk notices Wick's classic car...and tries to buy it off him. But Wick isn't interested and declines. Soon, the punk arrives at Wick's home with some goons where they surprise him--beating him senseless, destroying his stuff, killing his dog and stealing his car! This is when you then learn that Wick is a super-assassin....and the punk chose the wrong guy to attack. The jerk's father is a big-time Russian mobster....and it's a contest to see who will win...the mobster and his gang or Wick on his own. Considering there are (so far) two MORE John Wick films, it pretty much seems certain who will win this battle.To say ""John WIck"" is a violent film is a gross undestatement. Once the dog dies, it's pretty much a bloodbath from then on...with Wick dispatching countless goons VERY realistically on his way to ultimate revenge.

Nice to see Keanu again.,"It is B level action movie. You can easily remind of other movies like this. Equillibrium, District 13, The transpoter and many other action movies with handsome, heroic guy.Keanu fights usually with guns in this movie. But it brings more body action into the shooting scenes, so it becomes more stylish. Great to watch it at home, not boring at all, if you don't expect something like 007 series with Daniel Craig or Born series. Keanu kept his face and body almost perfect, so he is still handsome and fit, good enough for the film like this. But the enemies have less impression. They are fine but not new, bit similar to villains from 90's action movies. I recommend this movie if you are looking for something easy and fun, and you've already watched every other great action movies like Born Ultimatium or 007 Casino Royal.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"

"A solid return to form for Keanu Reeves, and a rare standout action flick","After a recent barrage of rather forgettable action films, it's refreshing to see that 'John Wick' provides excellently-choreographed, energized fight sequences as well as elaborate chase scenes, in addition to a likable protagonist who you can easily root for.In essence a revenge flick, 'John Wick' details the titular ex-hit-man's mission to hunt down the people that stole his car and killed his dog, the latter being a final gift from his deceased wife. As it turns out, the people he's pursuing are related to his former employer.I'm not the hugest fan of Keanu Reeves as an actor, but he nails the role of John. It's largely a physical performance, with John being a seemingly introverted, rarely talkative individual. This sympathetic, almost vulnerable side is juxtapositioned effortlessly with the brutal, merciless part of him that reawakens on his quest for vengeance. A great return to form for someone who hasn't really had a decent role since 'The Matrix Trilogy' or 'A Scanner Darkly'.A lot of the other cast members, such as Willem Dafoe and John Leguizamo, as well as a surprisingly large amount of people who have worked on HBO programs, receive very limited screen time considering their impressive portfolios. Nevertheless, they are all still able to maintain a hefty screen presence.Being directed by a stunt choreographer, it doesn't really come as a surprise that 'John Wick' has some ridiculously well-made shootouts and car chases. A highlight is John's rampage through a nightclub, gunning down countless dozens of thugs in his pursuit of his dog's killer. As opposed to a lot of the uninspired, uninventive cinematic action releases of recent years, 'John Wick's' set-pieces maintain a highly fluid and energetic quality.The film itself has an interesting portrayal of the complex criminal underworld that lies right on the brink of normal society, a world that John is forced to return to. Everyone appears to know each other (John included), from 'waste disposers' to bartenders to hotel guests. It comes across as an unorthodox (yet welcome) hybrid of Guy Ritchie and David Lynch tropes.On the whole, 'John Wick' is a standout production in a list of otherwise banal recent action films, aided by its excellently-crafted actions scene, and a solid protagonist in the form of Keanu Reeve's John.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"

WICK grossed over 43 Million, more than double its production cost! The cinematography was inspired, at times even artistic. The sound and sound mixing were at least a cut above your average Hollywood movie, which, to be honest, is really saying a lot! And other visual elements, such as sets, costumes and locations were all impressive.Absolutely must get one other thing off my chest. Despite the numerous fight scenes being extremely well choreographed and the endless gun- play having been blocked out meticulously...

Surprised!,"2014 has not been the best year for movies. There are many movies like this one, shoot em up type of things. The expendables was one of them, and from the previous 2 films, this one did not excite. All 3 of them in my opinion are terrible. Many of these types of movies are terrible, with the plot being too cliché or unable to make sense with, or it is too unrealistic. This movie was much different.When I first saw the trailer I was happy to see Keanu Reeves back, for he had not come out with many things since the Matrix. Then I realized what the movie consisted of and my emotions changed quick. I went to the theater hoping it was at least better than the expendables or any other movie that is like that, but it was entirely different. The plot i admit was cliché, and the fact that John Wick could kill that many people and survive is a little ridiculous, but the movie is very enjoyable! The actions scenes are amazing and very fun to watch. Keanu Reeves is perfect for this role, and this is probably going to be a reboot to his career. He does not disappoint in this movie, in fact, this is in my opinion his best acted movie. If this movie didn't have good acting in it it would not be as good. There are some flaws to the movie as in any other, but I can honestly say that this is one of my favorite movies of the year.This film is rated R, and for a reason. There are an occasional F bomb, and no sexual themes in it. The movie is rated R for violence. There is some blood spray when people are being shot, or from being beaten. There are also some mature thematic material in the movie involving the death of his wife due to I believe is cancer or some other disease, and the brutal murdering of his dog that was given to him by his wife. Now take note that the movie revolves around the dog and john getting revenge on the people who killed it. I would strongly recommend not showing this movie to anyone under the age of 14.Overall this movie is excellent. It doesn't take much thinking to watch, but definitely excites.

"A stylish, original revenge thriller with some truly great action.","Despite starring in some undeniably iconic roles early in his career, Keanu Reeves has struggled to maintain any sort of momentum, with every critically acclaimed performance or box office success followed by a string of disappointing and underwhelming projects. But thanks to his former stunt double Chad Stahelski, Reeves once again finds himself headlining a solid action flick that has plenty of buzz around it.Despondent over the death of his wife, retired assassin John Wick (Reeves) spends his days moping around his house, with a beagle puppy as his only companion. The dog arrived on his doorstep shortly after his wife's funeral, a final gift so that John wouldn't have to carry on alone. But an untimely run-in with Iosef Tarasov (Alfie Allen), the son of a local Russian mobster, results in the theft of John's 1969 Ford Mustang and the death of his puppy, leaving John with nothing to love - and nothing to lose.Yes, that's a ridiculous segue, but it also perfectly conveys the tone of John Wick. The premise is unapologetically silly, but Reeves approaches the material with such fervor that we quickly forget about his motivations. It doesn't matter that Wick is singlehandedly disassembling the infrastructure of the Russian crime syndicate because of a dog - what matters is how much fun the film is having while he does it. Wick stalks from scene to scene with the precision of The Terminator, scarcely wasting a single movement as he dispatches bad guys in impressive numbers, with equally impressive methods.Surrounding the nearly non-stop action is an interesting mix of supporting characters, including Ian McShane as the owner of a hotel for assassins, whose roles dictate that no business be conducted on the premises, and Willem Dafoe as Wick's mentor, Marcus, himself an expert sharpshooter. And we can't forget Adrianne Palicki, a fellow contract killer out to collect the $2 million bounty placed on Wick's head by Tarasov's father, Viggo (Michael Nyqvist), who also happens to be Wick's former employer.Stahelski, who first doubled for Reeves on The Matrix before moving on to several other films with the actor, including Constantine, Man of Tai Chi and both Matrix sequels, has teamed up with longtime collaborator David Leitch for John Wick, a stylish revenge thriller that heralds the arrival of a bold new voice. While Stahelski is credited as the director due to DGA regulations, this is very much a team effort, as Stahelski and Leitch have channeled their decades of experience as stunt coordinators and second unit directors into a remarkably original film that boasts some of the best action sequences in recent memory.While John Wick certainly isn't a perfect film - the script is paper-thin in more than a few places, and Reeves has a handful of laughably poor dialogue deliveries - it never stops having fun. This is a film that refuses to take itself seriously, opting instead to just strap in, buckle up and enjoy the ride. And as long as audiences can follow suit, rather than searching for some deeper meaning, they should find themselves pleased with the results.-- Brent Hankins, www.nerdrep.com",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"

Kill All The Things,"Keanu Reeves always comes back with a little gem but this one is his best film in ages.It's a pure Kill Film, nothing more and nothing less. Keanu, as John Wick, has the only two things he has left in this world taken from him at a time when he has nothing left to live for and so, entirely understandably, he decides to take revenge. Keanu then proceeds to kill a significant amount of people.Here's what I liked about John Wick: clearly, whoever was in charge, really loves film and/or knows exactly how to improve upon every mediocre revenge film out there. The clichéd bits seemed almost deliberate like a teacher showing his or her film students how to make a tired and overdone scene interesting and unique.I won't expand too much on this point other than to say that there is something engaging about every scene no matter how often it has been done before.What I really want to talk about is the fight scenes. This is the first time since the Bourne films that I feel someone has done something different and unique with fight choreography. All the fights seemed to be filmed in one take and without stunt doubles. There was one extended fight scene in particular in the middle which was stunning. I genuinely can't think of another actor who would have pulled off Keanu's character and choreography as well as he did.During the inevitable 'sit-down' with the bad guy and his men, they missed an opportunity to mirror a previous scene with a 'captured' female assassin, nevertheless; Keanu gets an opportunity to really let go and bring some much needed emotion to his character. I thought he could have gone further and this could have been more poignant but he delivered the scene really well.I think it's time to officially acknowledge a new genre of film: the kill film. I wouldn't label it as action because I expect action films to include action as part of the main story not the other way around. If you want to watch a good revenge/kill film, this is definitely the one.9/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
Seeking for Flavor,"If Death Wish is a revenge for a murdered wife or Taken a revenge for a kidnapped daughter, then John Wick takes vengeance over a death of a dog and a stolen car. At glance, people might find it quite silly, but the movie touches no irony within that plight, it simply just pictures a desperate man with nothing left to lose. However, it still displays a strange mix of tones: it introduces the story as some sort of a serious tragedy, and then we discover that this world turns out to be surrounded with a punchline of him having a normal reputation of killing people. The combination of gritty revenge thriller and tongue-in-cheek world of assassins is fine, but how the film connects them can be a little uneven, but once the guns appear, the fun is presented perfectly. It just lives up to what it is meant to be. There isn't anything big, neither mind blowing. John Wick is as straightforward as any fine revenge movie must be, plus an odd brightening flavor.Despite of setting up with a bleaker drama, John Wick actually builds a cooler mythology of its own. Sure, Wick basically has a legend of being the most lethal hit-man his enemies will ever face, that also defines to the characters who personally know him. Example is a cop who just found him wacked a few bad guys and still lets him go, because he is ""John Wick!"" It's his thing! Everyone else in this world also has their own backstories, there must be some richer stories behind them, but in the end, that's just the movie giving this typical revenge flick some personality, and it indeed helps, keeping the experience from being stale.The plot never compromises with any twists, it just slow burns to the point until the anti-hero finds his target. This slow burn can be a little dragging, it introduces too much exposition that most of it turn out not going to matter in the end, they are probably designed to build more tension. The movie is better when it's finally on the action. The film biggest credit here is the camera work. There is not a shot that misses some sort of violence. Every gunshot and fist has to present the consequence on screen which manifests his boiling anger. And even without the fights, there are still some slick, stunning sights to see around. Predictably, Keanu Reeves must be the only one who is taking this silliness seriously, which makes sense since his character is the only one who is in real pain in this fancy mission. That vast seriousness just perfectly suits at depicting Wick's desperation and madness, also his fighting hits even harder compared to those days in The Matrix. But the show stealer here is Michael Nyqvist who brings the joy in his nutty yet menacing performance as the villain.John Wick sometimes feels like there is a larger world meant to be explored or a deeper theme to be considered, but the film has priorities of following the classic roots of the revenge genre. It's not so bad since it makes for an easy viewing through its fine looking action scenes, but it also leaves a lot of potential hanging. But if you are only here for Keanu Reeves back in action, then this movie totally sells, in fact that is what we are all here for anyway. Still, we might have thought of some possibilities if the movie was more ambitious, but then most of us won't think it matters. It's already stunningly crafted, if not original or special. Just sit right in for a straightforward show of violent gunfights.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
Hard Hitting Action,"Whether or not you are going to enjoy this movie depends entirely on what it is you hope to get out of it. I fear for many it has been over-hyped, or just the high rating on the page leads folks to expect more than the movie is actually trying to sell. What it's selling is extremely well done action, and if you're content with just that then it will deliver in spades.Keanu Reeves plays the retired super-hit-man John Wick. He's pulled back into the world he left behind when the arrogant and ignorant son of a mob boss roughs him up for kicks (it's a little more personal than that, but I don't want to spoil it.) This sends John on a rampage through an underground world of mafia figures and hired killers. It really is that simple.While the plot is as bare bones as it gets, there's a surprisingly deep world being built. It's a world in which there is a hotel specifically set up for hired killers to whole up in while they're on the job. It's a world where a body clean up crew is just a phone call away. It's a stylized world to be sure, but it's an intriguing one as well. It also helps that it's populated by some recognizable faces. Just the casting of folks like Ian McShane, Willem Dafoe, and John Leguizamo turns what are fairly thin characters into something that works. Many of the actors bring a certain caliber just by their presence that makes this world work.But really, you're here for the action. And it's stellar. Firstly there are wonderfully long takes, no rapid cut trickery here. You know exactly what's going on and where everything is. And I personally LOVE the fighting style that John uses. While he appears to be a decent shot, his tactic is to get in close and then pump his target full of bullets. It's actually been a long standing pet peeve of mine that in so many action movies, the bad guys (especially henchmen) go down with a single bullet to some unspecified part of the body. John Wick is a professional, and he takes no chances. Even one of the innumerable body guards is going to get three shots to the gut and two to the head, just so John can be certain that he doesn't have to deal with that person again. It's fast, it's efficient and it's thrilling.The film loses a little big of steam towards the end. The natural climax of the film happens with about 20 minutes left to go, and the final action scene isn't as thrilling or as poignant as it wants to be. That said it's not a deal breaker, and the action scenes that come before the climax more than make it worth going through the slightly weaker ending.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"

High Energy Action Fun,"John Wick (2014)*** (out of 4)After the death of his beloved wife, former hit-man John Wick (Keanu Reeves) comes out of retirement when a Russian mobster's son breaks into his home, steals his car and kills his dog, which was a gift from his deceased wife. Soon the mobster (Michael Nyqvist) puts a contract out on Wick's life knowing that he's coming for revenge.JOHN WICK isn't a film that is going to be studied in film schools and it's certainly not going to be for those seeking ""high art"" or ""meaning"" in their movies. No, JOHN WICK is a terrific throwback to the crazy martial art flicks from the 70s. I couldn't help but watch this film and think of someone like Sunny Chiba in the STREET FIGHTER series. This film here is, of course, a lot more friendly to today's times as it contains non-stop bloody violence as it appears Wick just loves head shots.The film works so well for a couple of reasons with the first being that this character really fits Reeves style. By now we shouldn't expect too much for Reeves. Often times he sleepwalks through his roles with that laid back approach of his but that quiet nature actually works extremely well for this character. That certain coldness Reeves brings to the film works tremendously well as you can't help but root for him and cheer each time one of the bad guys fall. Nyqvist is also very good in his role as the Russian mobster and he too makes you believe his character. Willem Dafoe is also fun in his supporting role.The film manages to have some nice style and especially during the action sequences. There's no question that this here is one of the most violent action pictures in recent years with the action scenes containing a great amount of attention to detail but they're played out so well that it almost seems like you're watching a video game. Most of the gunshots, and there are hundreds, are in the bloody to extremely bloody range but the film is just so much fun that even those who don't normally like that type of stuff should be able to still have fun. JOHN WICK certainly isn't the work of Orson Welles but it's not trying to be. It's goal was to be a bad ass action film and it succeeds at that.",,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"

Keanu Reeves is back in an action flick done right.,"Personally, I am not really a big fan of the clichéd revenge plot, especially when its applied to big Hollywood action movies. However, as soon as the positive buzz about John Wick started to come around, I started to become more curious about checking it out in theaters. It felt weird seeing great reviews out of a revenge story at first, but in the end, it turned out to be a pretty good action thrill ride.John Wick takes the plot of a hit-man coming out of retirement to duke out justice on those who dare to mess with the things he loved and turns it into a fairly unique story. Sure, there are certain clichés and a delivery of cheesy lines at times, but the movie manages to not take itself seriously and makes those aspects work. Although it may a paper thin plot to begin with, its serviceable enough to introduce our characters and jumps straight into the action.The acting throughout is also serviceable enough for the type of action-driven story the movie was going for. Keanu Reeves may not be the greatest actor in the world and I can probably name 10 other actors that are worse than him, he somehow manages to put on a good performance. Its his best work of acting since The Matrix and I believe Reeves was meant to be an action star along the lines of Schwarzenegger and Statham. As for the rest of the cast including Michael Nyqvist, Alfie Allen, William Dafoe, and Dean Winters, lets just say that they do a solid job portraying their given characters. They aren't really bad by any means, its just the main focus is on John Wick since he is the title of the film.In terms of technical aspects, its pretty much the strongest part about the movie. The lighting gives the film a very dark and gritty feel throughout its run-time and its certain shading of blue colors also adds to the film's bleak environment. Every camera shot is smooth and steady and they keep a tight focus on showcasing the fast paced action on screen. Speaking of action scenes, they are also executed brilliantly through excellent choreography and great editing, all without having to resort to unnecessary shaky cam.John Wick is one of the best American action flicks to come out in quite some time. It may not be on the same level as The Raid 2, it still come in pretty close in terms of high octane action. Its simple story and characters give you something to work off of and its adrenaline fueled action sequences will have you on the edge of you seat and wanting more when its all over. If you are the type of person who craves this crazy level of vengeance and violence, then you owe to yourself to go and check out John Wick. Definitely worth a recommendation.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"

Just a fun film,"I had an opportunity to see this movie at an early release showing, and I passed it up. Once I saw the film, I could've kicked myself for missing it. This is a relatively straight forward action film, that spends just the right amount of time setting up the main character. Then, the movie kicks into high gear, and it doesn't let up until the end. Believe the hype on this one, it is a gem of an action film. The fight sequences are well-choreographed, and this can't be emphasized enough, filmed cleanly with no shaky cam.Keanu gets a lot of flack for being a somewhat wooden actor. Maybe this is true, but it suits him well in this film. He's supposed to be some truly fearful man, so when he decides to tell you why he is on this quest for vengeance, you better listen. The nightclub scene is iconic, and he owns it. The rest of the action is solid, but not much can hold a candle to that scene. The film loses a beat in the last act, but not enough to take away from the enjoyment of the film.On a somewhat personal level, the opening scenes establishing John's relationship with his wife, when he receives her final gift, and when he finally tells Viggo why he is on this mission of vengeance, along with the absolutely excellent action combine to make a movie that is well above the average. One of my favorite movies of 2014.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
Awesome movie,"Three things you shouldn't do to a bad-ass:1. Ruining his life 2. Kill he's family 3. Push him till he snapsThe story is about ex-hit-man comes out of retirement to track down the gangsters that took everything from him.When I first heard the news that this movie was getting made and the face that two directors that never directed anything before I thought it was going to be a load of crap, but it turns out I was wrong and this movie is awesome.Keanu Reeves is simple at his best here, even if he's not the greatest actor on the planet, he does try every role and in this movie he does. The directors of the film David Leitch and Chad Stahelski both do a excellent and fantastic job of directing this movie and I found out that these two are actually stunt men. The villain was good, the action scenes were shot perfectly.Towards the end of the movie felt a bit cliché for me. You know in every action movie that the main hero is facing off the main bad guy and they shouting out one liners at each other, you know what I mean and that to me felt like the writer's got lazy half way through.John Wick has to be the biggest surprise for me with it's intelligent writing and nail biting action scenes.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
Keanu Reeves is awesome,"John Wick(Keanu Reeves) a former hit man, who was considered the best. Is attacked in his home by thieves, they injure him, kill his dog, but there biggest mistake is that they did not kill, now John Wick will stop at nothing until they all are hunted down.I liked Keanu Reeves here, he was quite the bad ass, like Payback(1998) you'll be rooting for the bad guy, but unlike Payback, John Wick had some layers to him. There are some great fight and shoot out scenes. Also great supporting cast like Willem Dafoe. Also I felt it just wasn't just a simply revenge film, it also shows the darkness within a man's soul.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
Great Action!!! Had not seen good action movie like this in a while.,OK this is my first review so please if you actually read this have some patience with my movie critic abilities or lack there of. I thought this movie deserved at least a 7 as had some very good action scenes. What do people expect from an action movie? The motive that drove John Wick was basic however powerful enough to drive a person to kill. The villain lady in this is just gorgeous and the villain Russian son is very detestable. Critics that don't like this movie will not like any action movie. Go back to your romantic comedy section now!! It had been a while since I watched a Keanu movie but dude!! Keanu was awesome in this!! I hope there is at least a second part to this one.,7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
Viscerally enjoyable tosh,"When disease takes the wife of former contract killer John Wick, he can find no respite apart from a dog, gifted to him by his wife so that he will have something to focus his love on, to prevent him from slipping back into his former dark ways. A chance encounter with a Russian thug sees Wick's connection to this life severed, and he sets out for vengeance – a path that will take him up against the most powerful criminal gang in the city.Although it does start with a satisfyingly meaty emotional base, this film is one long action sequence of impossible acts and violence (with Wick seemingly looking to get extra XP from headshots). There is of course a limit to the appeal of this, but it is hard not to enjoy the mindless dark heart of this whole film, as it relentlessly drives forward with little thought of external logic, instead selling itself hard and fast throughout. Mostly this approach works; with minimal set-up it is not long before the violence begins in earnest, and it is solidly and stylishly done throughout, with slick design and satisfying set-pieces. The style does help because, with Wick being pretty much the Terminator, it is not always easy to feel any tension from peril, so instead we get the tension from the relentlessness and the speed of movement.Reeves is a good lead for this, since it does essentially require him to be emotionless and enigmatic – both of which he can pull off. He is surrounded by familiar faces, all of whom feel like maybe they were wasted by being in the film for only short times each, but all of which give the film a sense of quality – and everyone does produce something even if they only have one or two scenes (also fun for fans of The Wire to see the couple of faces showing up). All told, this is not the reinvention of action movies (as some have said) but it just a reminder of how they should be done well – enough emotional grit for us to care, and then good solid relentless action the rest of the way. It is nonsense, as so much of this genre is, but it is visceral, tough, dark, and really quite fun.",,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
Keanu Reeves proves he is still on top of the game,"Keanu Reeves shot to superstardom in Speed and that was a stunning two decades ago. Five years after crashing a bus through LA, he reaffirmed his star status in the then groundbreaking sci-fi action flick, The Matrix. Since then, the actor of mixed ancestry has dabbled in a number of high-profile projects and indie titles, produced an acclaimed documentary and directed his very first feature. But he has yet found a role that ranked alongside Jack Traven and Neo.All thanks to stunt coordinators and performers David Leitch and Chad Stahelski (founders of action outfit, 87Eleven), Reeves has finally found a character that redefined his flagging career. Forgive his almost soulless appearance in 47 Ronin, you want a badass Keanu Reeves action vehicle, you have it in John Wick. The script by the little known Derek Kolstad reeks of minimalism. It's purely a lazy action movie, one that frankly never pushes beyond the boundary. Yet somehow it works under the hands of Leitch and Stahelski and the casting of our leading man.With hardly a lull, Reeves plays a mysterious ex-assassin, a man so powerful at his craft that people jitters at the mere mention of his name. However, Wick decides to retire after his wife fell sick and after the death of his beloved partner, devoted his time to care for his pet dog – the last gift given by his late wife. Unfortunately, the son of a Russian mobster, Iosef (Alfie Allen from Game of Thrones) punctuates Wick's quiet life after he took a fancy to Wick's Ford Mustang. Isoef ambushed Wick at his home in the middle of the night, took his muscle car and gasp killed his dog! The ruthless act trigger the anger back in Wick and what follows is the ultimate revenge against those who are hired to stop him from killing Iosef and the target himself.The movie is structured predictably that you already knew what's coming. To its credit, John Wick is never pretentious, it served to entertain and it accomplished its goal with much ease in the end. Leitch and Stahelski are such old-timers in the stunt field that most of the action seen in Wick is both beautifully and brutally executed. Men are often stabbed, kicked, disabled and shot in the face and to the talented production designers, the numerous action sequences actually took place in a number of different locations such as a disco club, parking lot and hotel room just to give it a little variety. The raw bloody gunplay reminisces one of early John Woo movies and it's definitely a visual feast. Cinematographer Jonathan Sela (Max Payne, A Good Day to Die Hard) provides the movie with a chilling moody feel at the same time, keeping his lenses glued to the ground forsaking the usage of crappy shaky cams.Just when you thought Kolstad's storytelling is so uneventful, he manages to throw in surprises after surprises. Besides, the laugh- out-loud sardonic humour, the world of thugs, assassins in John Wick is much more than mere clichéd tough Russian mobsters, a promising setup for more sequels to come. Killers stayed in a luxurious hotel and they trade using only gold coins. A specialized crew is hired to clean up crime scenes and disposing the bodies. There are rules to abide with and everyone in this world comes with a price.Besides Reeves doing his tough guy routine and should I add he is damn good at it, Bridget Moynahan (I, Robot) also has a small role as Wick's wife seen in a brief flashback montage. Swedish actor Michael Nyqvist (Ghost Protocol) plays the movie's main villain, Iosef's mobster daddy and he plays it uber-cool. Everyone's favourite character actors Willem Dafoe and Ian McShane play a fellow assassin and a mysterious hotel's owner respectively.When it comes to voting for a stylish action packed movie for 2014, John Wick easily wins hands down. If you missed Denzel Washington hunting down Russian thugs in The Equalizer, then don't miss Keanu Reeves hunting down Russian thugs. It's just as crazy but with a dog in the latter, I declared John Wick the winner. Who can resist a cute puppy with Bambi eyes?",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"

The acting is okay but when the action starts you don't care about this anymore. Most of the action scenes are really cool and some of the gun fighting scenes are just awesome! For a Hollywood movie its actually quite realistic, you can see Keanu's training for The Matrix is still in his muscles. The main plot is not that special but some side plots are really nice.

It will leave you amazed, wondering if whether someone pro-read the script before they made it a movie. No twist, no surprise, no character development, nothing thrilling or exciting whatsoever. It is utter boredom. I felt intelligently insulted, to be honest.And the action does not look cool either. Seriously, if you expect something like, let's say, Taken, you will be massively disappointed. John Wick does not really fight. He shots randomly, move randomly, and grunts, and moans. Nothing else.

The Best Action Film I've Seen In Years!,John Wick is an instant classic action film. It doesn't have a crazy plot that makes it easy to get lost its just basic. You don't have to wait long for the action to begin and when it starts it goes pretty much right through to the end. I really hope that this is the beginning of a franchise because it certainly looks that way. I hope this film gets some attention because I didn't hear much talk about it and its run in the theater went by fairly quietly (although it did make 50 million bucks of profit). It also great to see Keanu Reeves find a role that seems to spark a comeback for him. Keanu has been a huge action star for over 20 years and its nice to see him back on top. John Wick may become one of his significant roles in the future.,,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
Glad to have you back Keanu.,"John Wick follows Keanu Reeves a retired hit man who's wife pasted away. He receives a dog as a final gift from her. On his second day with the dog he encounters thugs who want his car. He tells them no and wakes up later that night only to be beaten senseless, his dog killed and his car stolen. And he wants revenge.Everyone knows that Keanu Reeves doesn't have the best acting range. But when a roll is prefect for him he shines. And this is exactly what happens in John Wick. The film tiptoes the fine line between being ridiculous and over the top. As much killing as Keanu does is basically to get revenge for his dog. Which is borderline stupid but Reeves really sells it. Totally investing in his character and motives. Another notable actor here is William Defoe. While I thought his character was underused he wasn't underwritten and that was a nice little thing.The world that this film creates is intriguing and brutal. As reeves travels through the criminal underworld various phrases and items are used that are totally foreign even though this is set in New York City. Characters presumably know what they mean and don't bother explaining them to you. This is for the best. Being in the dark on the little things that make the world what it is, is gripping. It makes the world feel like it's been inhabited for a long time and that sets the film apart from the majority of action flicks. As lush as the world is, shoddy camera work struggles at bringing it to life on screen. The focus seemed to be forgotten in a large number of shots. Some shots don't even seem to be focused. The action scenes look great and are void of the annoying blur but in between these tense action sequences the camera work seems amateur at best. Maybe it was just the Theater I was In I don't know. Another problem for the movie was it's ending. Well I'd go as far as to say the entire 3rd act. *SPOILERS* Not much of a spoiler as we all knew Reeves would have his revenge. But after he takes his vengeance the movie limps on for at least another half hour. Attempting to tie up loose ends was a bad call here. It feels like the film climax and then says oh crap we forgot about him! And tries to deal with that and it goes through this 3 or 4 times. This is silly to say with an hour forty minute run time but the last half hour just feel unnecessary and overlong.Overall John Wick delivers on super cool action, a surprising level of emotional, and a world that feels real. John wick is a fine piece of cinema.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
A Flurry of Fun,"Disclaimer: I love this movie. It's basically the best one ever made. I'm not usually this positive when it comes to evaluating film, but I believe that this particular one deserves all the acclaim and more.The thing that stands out most has to be the action sequences. They are unlike most found in modern cinema with long, uninterrupted takes and beautiful choreography that really lend themselves to the realistic, bone-crunching feel of the film. Although the complexity of plotting left something to be desired, the filmmakers more than made up for it by building a rich, creative, history-laden world around their characters.The Action: The superb action in this movie can be directly attributed to the co-directors and their star. Both directors have been performing and coordinating big-budget film stunts for years. Chad Stahelski even doubled for Keanu Reeves in several films. Reeves's stunt background and dedication to learning his character's gunplay and martial arts styles helped bring his scenes to life in a way that would not be possible with other performers. Because of the crew's skills in the art of choreography, less cuts were needed during fight scenes which afforded them a more immersive feel.The Music: I have never been one to get too worked up, or bogged down, by the soundtrack of any given movie. Here, however, I found myself enthralled in its effectiveness. The gentle tune ""In My Mind"" by M86 and Susie Q really stood out by paradoxically fitting perfectly into the hot tub club scene. On the other end, Marilyn Manson's ""Killing Strangers"" provided a jolting assault of the rock variety to wake me back up for the next action sequence.The Supporting Players: Numerous interesting characters populate this original world. The performances that stand out the most come courtesy of John Leguizamo and Lance Reddick. Their introductions pulled me right into their specific areas of the criminal underworld without feeling too overbearing. Though neither muggs the screen for more than ten minutes, their impacts are felt immediately and leave a lasting impression.The Continental: As well-executed as John Wick is, I don't think it gets nearly enough credit for its creativity. The best use of this aspect can be seen inside the hit-man hotel, The Continental. This establishment primarily hosts assassins and other underworld types to be waited on by a staff providing world-class service to its patrons unlike any other. Most importantly, the hotel pulled me in leaving me wanting to know more about the history of this world to which we had just been introduced.The Plot: My biggest gripe with the movie has to be that the plot wears quite thin at times. Having scanned countless other reviews before writing my own, I know that this is not an unpopular opinion. It's really just a classic tale of revenge where the protagonist pursues the antagonist until somebody gives in. The reason John Wick does not suffer for its overly simplistic plot is that it stimulates the viewer in other ways like a good-old-fashioned sense of humor. It never takes itself too seriously.I can't image that they'll come anywhere near matching the magic of John Wick with its sequel, but I'm excited for Chapter 2 all the same. As long as they expand upon the interesting underground lore presented in the first movie while preserving the high quality action scenes, I have no doubt that Chapter 2 will satisfy my need for more John Wick.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
The one is back!,"Quickie Review:John Wick (Keanu Reeves) is a highly skilled ex-hit-man who receives a puppy from his dying wife to help him grieve. Things only get worse when a spoiled son of a crime boss steals John's car and murders his puppy. Now he must return to the criminal world he had left years ago to avenge all that he has lost. You have heard and seen this type of plot countless times, there are no surprises here, you will predict everything. But is it fun? Oh yes it is. Keanu owns his role and is a complete badass. So despite the unoriginality of the plot, John Wick is filled with some of the most original gunfights I've seen in a long time. Overall this movie is an entertaining pop-corn action flick that is well worth your time.Full Review:I think most would agree that Keanu Reeves is no thespian when it comes to his acting talents. So even though he has been in some terrible movies lately I still find to be a likable actor. I just want him to return to his glory days of being Neo, and John Wick seemed like the perfect opportunity for him to do that, so I was more than I excited to see it.Let's be real here, this movie could have come off very cheesy judging by its premise. However, Keanu through his action persona sold me on this seemingly odd world and character as being real and actually quite cool. You can see Reeves wholeheartedly dedicating himself to his role that you can't help but cheer him on for every brain splattering headshot (strange thing to cheer I know, but you'll know what I mean). Most importantly, this is an action film that actually shows the action. From what I can remember there was not a single shaky cam, every gun fight is brilliantly shot (pun intended) beginning to end. I also loved how precise the movements were, John Wick would always land a headshot and if he can't then he would shoot another part of the body to get an aim at the head. Just plain awesomeness.John Wick is not without its problems. As I mentioned before the plot is largely unoriginal, so whenever there are no fights the movie is not as engaging. Also I was quite underwhelmed by the climatic end. The rest of the movie had a great build in tension but the finale felt rushed, and left more to be desired. One of the positives of John Wick is the rich criminal underworld. It is filled with colorful characters and has very interesting ways in which it functions. There is a sense of mutual respect amongst the people in that world. I just wish we got to explore more of that world because I found it to be so intriguing and unique. I am sure they will if there ever is a sequel, which I do think this movie deserves.In the end, I thoroughly enjoyed my time watching John Wick. Yes it has some flaws, but I was able look past them to appreciate it for what it is. One word to sum up the movie would be ""personality,"" because even if it is working with tired story and character concepts John Wick does it with style and fun.Check out more on my movie review blog The Stub Collector: http://thestubcollector.wordpress.com/",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"

It's an okay movie with some annoying conveniences.,"I'll keep it simple and short:John Wick himself is a skilled assassin. However, a major reason why he IS soo ""legendary"" is because of how lame and stupid the bad guys are. Technically John Wick should have died roughly four times in the movie but because the enemy were stupid or for the convenience of John Wick, he lives.Aside from that the action is not bad, Keanu did great, and the whole continental concept is interesting.

Very Solid Action Film With A Great Turn By An Awesome Cast,"John Wick was a pleasant surprise when it showed up in trailer form a little over a month ago. Coming out of nowhere, this indie action pic with a fresh director and great cast wowed a lot of people, and for good reason. It boasted the promise of excellent action, with Keanu Reeves returning to form as the badass lead. And a badass he is. John Wick is the kind of action film we don't get these days, and the director clearly knows what he is doing in delivering a truly excellent action film.First things first, John Wick isn't going to win any big awards. It doesn't really do anything new, even in terms of innovative action. None of the characters are fresh and the story isn't really that original. But none of that matters because it's so stylishly crafted, the acting, direction, and writing so smooth, and the world so well designed, that any action junkie can get behind this slick, heavily stylized, action packed romp. After a flashforward, the film details the current state of John Wick's life. His wife has passed away and he is obviously taking it very hard. After her death, he receives one last gift from his wife, a puppy to help him keep from being alone. But it isn't long before he loses both his prized car and his last precious gift from his wife. With this taken from him, we find Wick falling back into his old life of assassination and violence. See, John Wick was once part of a world of criminals, assassins, and killers. And, according to the primary antagonist, he was the one who was hired to kill the boogey man.And it is here where the film picks up. Where those first quiet moments in the film were somewhat slow and dreary, from the moment John Wick becomes the victim of crime to the very end of the film, it's almost non-stop action. The biggest challenge the film had was setting up Keanu to meet the legend he is described in as the film. But I can completely reassure you that Keanu is a complete badass here. While he still is not the fine, domineering actor you might find in other recently christened killers like Liam Neeson, he has the skills necessary to prove that you don't mess with John Wick. Whether it's playing up the role of a superman, capable of tackling a younger, equally talented killer while suffering a severe injury, or taking on a dozen men, all armed, in a matter of a few minutes, Keanu doesn't need to rage, pull out a booming voice, or make speeches filled with slightly ambiguous threats. All he has to do is flip you over his back and put two in your head with ease. If you don't believe Keanu is the feared killer he's trumped up to be at first, you will by the end of the film.What helps pull this off are the thankful decisions of first time directors David Leitch and Chad Stahelski. As stuntmen, they clearly know their action. They eschew the typical, modern style of action of close ups and quick cuts in favor of nice, long medium and wide shots minus the quick cutting. This offers us practical action scenes and puts trust in the actors skills. Keanu has certainly proved himself capable physically, with his time spent in the Matrix and more recently Man of Tai Chi and Ronin 47. The directors allow him to use his skills to deliver action that never feels fake or trumped up. It's authentic and completely badass. Supporting him are an array of actors, including Wilem Defoe as an old friend in the business, Adrienne Palicki as a fellow assassin given an assignment to take John out, and Michael Nyquist and Alfie Allen as father and son gangsters, the latter of which who is the perpetrator of the crimes against Wick. Nyquist is especially good, a villain that isn't completely evil, and even a bit likable, who we're immediately introduced to as someone who doesn't necessarily want to do what he knows he has to do. He's entertaining in the role and makes for a criminal that, under different circumstances, might have actually been an ally to Wick.Action films of the guns and martial arts variety have kind of gone by the wayside in the past few years, with few theatrical releases and most being VOD. But John Wick is a welcome addition to a legacy of great cinema action. For any action junkie, John Wick is an absolute must and I can only hope that this isn't the last time we'll see this Wick.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"

*A Masterclass in Mayhem and Mourning*,"*John Wick* isn't just a movie; it's an electrifying odyssey that redefines the action genre with a bludgeoning brilliance that lingers long after the credits roll. Directed by Chad Stahelski, this 2014 film ignites the screen with a visceral energy that propels you into a world where every shot is precision, every fight a dance, and every moment crackles with raw emotion.From the first frame, we're swept into the life of John Wick, played with an unyielding intensity by Keanu Reeves-a retired assassin drawn back into the chaos when the vestiges of his former life are mercilessly ripped away. The narrative is deceptively simple: a man's quest for revenge after the senseless murder of his puppy, a final gift from his deceased wife. But what unfolds is anything but simple. It's a deep dive into grief and the consequences of violence, wrapped in an adrenaline-fueled package.What really sets *John Wick* apart is its stylish execution. The choreography is nothing short of mesmerizing-a tightrope walk of balletic gunplay where every bullet is a brushstroke on a canvas of mayhem. The film's aesthetic is slick and polished, blending neo-noir visuals with a pulsating electronic score that heightens the tension and euphoria in equal measure. You're not just watching a fight; you're experiencing a beautifully brutal ballet where every move reflects Wick's deep-seated pain and unquenchable thirst for vengeance.The film's universe is another layer of its genius. It presents an underworld filled with its own rules and codes of honor, where contracts are sacred and the line between predator and prey blurs. The Continental Hotel serves as a sanctuary and a stage for this dark performance, a place where even the most lethal of characters abide by a strict set of laws. This world-building invites viewers to contemplate the complexities of morality in a realm where life is both a commodity and a curse.And let's not forget the unforgettable supporting cast. From Ian McShane's charismatic Winston to the enigmatic yet formidable Aurelio, played by John Leguizamo, each character adds depth to Wick's journey, creating a compelling tapestry of alliances and enmities that enrich the story.Keanu Reeves delivers a career-defining performance, seamlessly blending stoicism with vulnerability. His portrayal of John Wick isn't just that of an unstoppable force; it encapsulates a man burdened by grief and haunted by his past. Each calculated action tells a story, and you can feel every ounce of his sorrow in the relentless determination that drives him forward.In the end, *John Wick* is not merely a tale of revenge; it's a poignant exploration of love, loss, and the darkness that follows in the wake of violence. It's a relentless, stylish thrill ride that keeps your heart racing and your mind questioning. Prepare to be captivated and brutalized all at once because John Wick isn't just coming back-he's here to remind us that every action has consequences, and in the world of shadows, there's no escaping the past.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"

With the plot of John Wick somewhat laughably mimicking the career of Keanu Reeves, we cannot help but enjoy the thrilling ride of seeing a solid action film.I do not usually give the plot of the film but I feel it is appropriate for this one. John Wick, a once great hit man, comes out of retirement from his peaceful quiet life to track down the men who took everything he had, showing he has not lost his touch at what he does. With the exception of trying to enact revenge on people who wrecked his life, that plot sounds a lot like Keanu Reeves's career. That is why I thought he was perfect for the role and why the role was perfect for him.I would have given this movie a higher rating if it was not for the fact that I have seen this type of movie many times before. In fact, John Wick reminded me a lot of a movie I saw a month ago called The Equalizer which has an extreme number of similarities with John Wick. If it was the first time I ever saw a movie with this plot, it would be one of my favorite films. Sadly, it is not the case and I never was really surprised with the direction the movie went.Enough about that, time to get on to why I still liked the movie. The main reason the movie is very enjoyable is because it accomplished what it wanted as solid action film. It did not try to do more or get overly complicated in it's own plot leaving the audience lost. It was clear-cut and direct, what many films are not successful achieving. There is no one is better to achieve it than Keanu Reeves. I am not sure if the script was written with Keanu Reeves in mind or if it was just cast perfectly. Whatever the case may be, the intimidating, quiet, resourceful guy pretty much describes Keanu Reeve's bread and butter role. The rest of the cast did their job accordingly, but Keanu Reeves definitely shines in his return to action films.If you are in a theater where they are showing both John Wick and The Equalizer, flip a coin and you will enjoy both of them equally. Still, I recommend you see John Wick at some point while it is still in theaters.For more of my reviews go to my website at reviewsbywest.com",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
Some people don't seem to realize what this movie is..,It's an ACTION movie! It's not meant to broadcast Oscar performances. Keanu fits perfectly into the role of this movie and actually trains really hard and impressively (if you watch the videos of the actors preparing for the movie) performs and pulls it off. It's a simple plot yet offers insight into the world John wick is in and the action defines it. Really just take it as it is. A fun revenge action film(one of my favorites). Nit picking and complaining just means this isn't the movie for you.,9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
Lots and lots of action...,"Without being able to claim to be a particular fan of Keanu Reeves, then I had very little expectations to ""John Wick"" prior to sitting down and watching it. I knew it was in the action thriller genre, and that was about it.And now that I have seen it, I must honestly admit that I was more than pleasantly surprised with the outcome of this movie. I was more than entertained by the storyline, and the sheer volume of action sequences in the movie is more than sufficient to keep any action fan more than happy. I will actually go as far as to saying that this is actually among the more enjoyable and entertaining of movies that I have seen starring Keanu Reeves.The storyline, in all its simplicity, is about a retired gun-for-hire, John Wick (played by Keanu Reeves), who just lost his beloved wife. And as a small puppy shows up at this doorstep, as a last gift from his departed wife, John finds some reason to continue on in his grief and his downtrodden world. However, when a group of Russian thugs steal his car and kills his puppy, they have no idea who they are messing with, nor the magnitude of his skills and capabilities.While the story is fairly simple, it is tremendously entertaining, and the added spice of all the action sequences really help lift up the movie to a very enjoyable level. The action sequences are really well executed and equally well filmed.""John Wick"" is not a movie that requires any thinking from the audience, so you just simply sit back and enjoy the action.I am rating ""John Wick"" a solid seven out of ten stars. And it was good to see a movie of this scale from Keanu Reeves. If you enjoy action movies, then ""John Wick"" is highly recommendable.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
Killer Revenge,"John Wick is a topnotch, taut, wildly entertaining action flick. It is stripped down, precise, and slick. Wick has style akin to Michael Mann's Collateral but trims some of the philosophical edge off. There are multiple uses of well-timed awkward humor even. You might laugh, you might cry, but you will be entertained, and isn't that what we want? Maximus Decimus Meridius knew it, so he told the Romans in Gladiator.John Wick is the best assassin out for vengeance film I've seen since Lee Jeong-beom's The Man From Nowhere, released in 2010 and available on Netfilx streaming service now, I highly recommend it. The film begins with John falling out of the driver's seat of an SUV badly wounded and bleeding from his abdomen, it looks as though it is the end. We then travel back to a time when this man had peace and harmony in his life until his wife died from a terminal disease. As a parting gift from his wife, John gets beagle puppy via delivery service. John is able to grieve and heal his spirit taking care of this cute dog. One day he is filling his bad ass 1969 Boss Mustang up as some young cocky Russian man offers to buy it, John declines and drives away. The Russian doesn't take no for an answer.In a night raid at John's home the gangsters get the better of him and kill the puppy in the process but not Mr. Wick. This is their death sentence. John comes out of retirement and systematically works his way through these mafia thugs as an art form. As Christopher Walken speaks of his friend Creasy in Man On Fire; ""A man can be an artist at anything, Creasey's art is death."" John Wick is an artist of death, everything he picks up is a weapon, but especially guns. Director John Woo may be credited with inventing his so-called 'bullet ballet', but John Wick wields guns the way the fabled samurai handled their katana. You could call it Gun Fu, but not the unreal type seen in Equilibrium.Keanu Reeves really gets a chance to let lose in this and I loved it. By the time he says the line ""I'm thinking I'm back!"" you'll want to stand up and cheer. He gets to use some of the Kung Fu he's been adept at since The Matrix along with the gunplay, and even some good driving stunts where he is clearly the one driving and not a stunt driver. Willem Dafoe who is one of my favorite actors has a good supporting role as a fellow hit-man who's known John a long time. The Russian mafia kingpin is played by Mikael Nyqvist, who was Mikael Blomkvist in the Swedish film adaptations of Stieg Larsson's Millennium trilogy (known here as The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo). He is menacing and understandably angry with his son for bringing John's wrath upon them.If you like no apologies action films this is for you. There's even the obligatory, exclusive-techno-nightclub shootout scene through a crowded dance floor. If you're still reading you should stop and get to your local cinema to see Mr. Wick in fine lethal form.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
John Wick Portrays Keanu Reeves who Back in a Solid Action Thriller,"This action adventure presents a simple, straightforward violence and revenge movie that does not offer any refreshing idea, but some creatively designed small elements in the gangsterism world and its political cultures however might surprise the audiences. John Wick is definitely portraying Keanu Reeves rather than the other way round who used to be expressionless or impassive, cool and less talking, and perhaps his personality and life experience might be the two important factors that make him suits perfectly in this character full with sorrow, miserable and anger. More than three quarters of the film are filled with stylish scores, adrenalin-rush and thrilling action art sequences captured in great angles and cinematography, but the emotional built-up and the relationship with the cute puppy in the beginning seems to be too short, pushing the film towards a slight monotonous ending.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
"People Keep Asking If I'm Back. Yeah, I'm Thinking I'm Back.","Keanu Reeves is back and better than ever. After a long drought on bad quality films, Reeves aimed to get back into the good graces of audiences by making this completely over the top action film. While the story is pretty generic, the action and the directing is simply top notch. If you want intense action scenes that are simply amazing R rated fun, mixed in with some fabulous acting, then you are looking in the right direction. This is my review of John Wick.The film was written by Derek Kolstad and this is only his third writing credit. His prior two movies were both direct to home video action films. I have watched both of those movies he wrote(One in the Chamber and The Package). Having already watched some of his efforts in the past, I knew story wise this wasn't going to be perfect. However, the story is good cheesy fun. Reeves character(John Wick) has a tough life with the recent passing of his wife. She leaves him this sweet little dog as a gift to remember her to grieve with someone. One afternoon Wick is at a gas station and these thugs start up a conversation about his sweet 1969 Ford Mustang. The one thug ask Wick how much he wants for the car, only to reply that it is not for sale. They of course aren't happy, so they break into his house at night to kill the dog and rough him up. They of course have no idea who this person at the gas station was. This starts the chain of events that leads Wick back into the game. While the underlying story is cheesy, it is sweet fun for this genre of films. While Kolstad's effort won't net him any awards, it should make his name more popular as the characters and the set up for the action is simply amazing. I give his effort on this film a big thumbs up.The film was directed by David Leitch and Chad Stahelski. Neither of these two have ever directed a film before. They have both worked as stunt coordinators. Reading into that before you go see the movie could sound some alarms, but they shot this film perfectly in my opinion. The action scenes are fast and very intense. The hand to hand combat is stellar work, and with no shaky cam action, the audience can really savor each moment in the bigger action scenes. While there is some downtime in the film, the acting plugs those holes. Keanu Reeves headlines a fabulous cast that also includes Michael Nyqvist, Willem Dafoe, Dean Winters, Adrianne Palicki, and Ian McShane. The acting as I just said was top level in this film. Having so many acting legends in this one film is great because action movies do have downtime where characters need to drive the film. While there is some downtime earlier in the film, the amazing acting more than makes up for it. The first outing for these two is none other than something perfectly done. This is a fun action film that hardcore fans of the genre will love to watch. The R rating also helps as there is a great deal of blood and other over the top moments that you can't get away with on a PG-13 film. This was a fantastic effort and I cannot wait to see their projects in the future.Joel J. Richard scored the film with some original music from Tyler Bates. Both have worked on bigger action films, so they know how to add a great deal of depth to a score. I really enjoy the score in this film. The bigger action scenes have some great pieces as the action is moving along. There is never really a moment when I was underwhelmed by the score. I love a great score and this is certainly one of the better scores from 2014. Both Richard and Bates get a big thumbs up in my opinion.Overall, this is one thrilling joy ride. The action is fast paced, with some downtime that fills in perfectly with some great acting. The actions scenes are shot perfectly and the hand to hand combat is very intense. My only real complaint is some of the downtime tends to drag on a bit, but it doesn't hurt the film all that much. Fans of the 1980s action genre will love this film. Those on the fence, well jump on over. This is a great film to see and it is worth every penny.I also want to talk about the IMAX version as that is the version I watched. The IMAX version adds a tremendous amount of quality sounds, which in turn adds to the fantastic score. The picture level of course is certainly not there as the film was not shot using IMAX cameras. If you can view the IMAX version on a discount showing that would be the best bet. Otherwise, I don't really think it was worth the extra price of admittance.9/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
"10 for style, 5 for substance, 0 for logic, bonus for dogs and franchise","This movie parts with logic on many an occasion, but it gives high importance to stylized doom game style head-shots. What is cool is reputation Keanu's character brings in, in the style of ""your reputation precedes you"" and ""my name Wick, John Wick"". In fact, Wick is originally Belorussian, as revealed in the sequels that are better than the original, and movie is not anti-Russian, in fact, Russian mobsters used to be John's friends and employers, just happen to have a millennial son or should we say SOB, with typical entitlement and lack of character issues, together with millennial trademark, an entirely empty head. The franchise plus dogs up my grade quite a bit. Taken on its own merits, the movie is little more than stylized game-play of some doom game descendant, that lacks most in the area of elementary logic. Wick kills close to 100 associates of the stupid entitled millennial's poor mobster father who is his ex boss and who respects him still, but when given a clear chance to rid of this ""baba yaga"" Wick menace, the boss does not take it. This is perhaps the most glaring plot-hole, but there are many others, since movie asks us to suspend disbelief too many times. Realism dies early in the movie, but as a substitute there is an alternative universe in which assassin coins are used for assassin business, and there is that Continental assassin safe house hotel. Such infrastructure implies abundance of assassins but who are they assassinating every day? Not even small army would need this but in war zone there is no shortage of targets, perhaps there needs to be so many assassins since they keep killing themselves at such a rate, but it is perhaps best not to overthink anything in this piece of stylized gun-game-play. It is comforting to think that life of one doggy who you barely had for a week is worth countless hooman lives, dog owners would certainly unleash hell on those who dare kill our best friends, so noble in their disposition, so uncorrupted by temptations other than juicy treats, so loyal and superior in character that, yes, he who truly knows humans cannot help but adore dogs.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
"Hello, my name is Inigo Montoya, you killed my dog, prepare to die...","... slaughtering a line from the superior ""Princess Bride"". It's a shame that Keanu Reeves is supposed to be one of the nicest guys to work
with in Hollywood, because this film is a mess. We should stop asking Hollywood to come up with original ideas, because when they do, this is the result. 101 minutes of cliched action that checks all of the boxes - retired hit-man coming out of retirement, a boy and his dog, the perfect wife who is conveniently dead, stolen cars, Russian mobsters, a spoiled son who doesn't have half the restraint and judgment of dad precisely because dad spoiled him, and lots of blood.We should stop criticizing the millennials so much, because all we've bequeathed to them is 100K of student debt each for four year degrees that don't get them jobs and films like this.

The atmosphere is good and gives the feeling of a city that is governed by a crime syndicate. Acting is quite good compared to other recent action movies I saw lately.

Second the reason Viggo's son doesn't know about wick is because he's young and all the other gangsters have been around a lot longer than him, plus everyone thought wick was retired so why would they tell the son about a retired guy? Lastly in my opinion an action movie would be quite boring if the protagonist won every single fight perfectly without so much as a scratch. Overall in my opinion it was a great movie.

Does what it says on the tin,"John Wick is not an Oscar winning thriller with performances to match Ledger's Joker, however in terms of action it is sensational.

Don't mess with the dog!,"Keanu Reeves has not offered the cinematic world much since The Matrix trilogy. Can John Wick reignite his impact?Walking into the cinema... John Wick has had a positive buzz, but is it enough to get people to the theatres? The appeal is seeing Keanu back in his wheel house. Films with short bits of dialogue, subtle humour and a multitude of action. Not since Point Break has Reeves had a role that looked so right for him.Overall rating: 3 stars Cinematic value: 3.75 stars Family value: 1.5 stars'Fortune favours the brave' English translation of John Wick's tattoo'Do not mess with a man's dog' is basic knowledge in film class 101. From Old Yeller to Turner & Hooch, the dog serves as the catalyst for some of the key events in film history. John Wick is no different. Wick's last gift from his recently deceased wife is a puppy named Daisy. She serves as a connection to his wife and as comfort during his grief. Through a chance encounter with the Russian mafia, he is robbed and without spoiling too much of the story, they mess with the dog. Which unleashes a tale of revenge and a horrific day at the office for the men who robbed John Wick. Call it arrogance or naivety, these thieves robbed the wrong guy. Wick only recently retired from being a hit-man. Wick was not just any assassin, but The Bogeyman, feared by the mere mention of his name. The thieves cause the emotional tipping point for him to unleash his revenge on the dark criminal underworld. The story takes Wick on a hunt for the men who 'took away his opportunity to grieve' and through the process, his past is revealed and the audience is introduced to the hit-man's hidden world. His target through most of the film is Iosef Tarasov played by Alfie Allen (Game of Thrones), who seems to have perfected the pathetic, elder son role in television and on the big screen. The unsympathetic character of Iosef seems to warrant the inevitable vigilante justice from his introductory scene. As with most revenge films, the believability of survival of the main character goes beyond comprehension, but it is an undeniable, guilty pleasure to experience.Keanu Reeves (Matrix) is the champion for the average man. He never comes off as too smart or fit, but is at his best with little dialogue and multiple points of action. This film happens fast and is over before you can consider the sheer lunacy of the concept. The debutant directorial team of David Leitch and Chad Stahelski, give Reeves the perfect storyline to capitalise on his strengths. Like all of the action in this film, they seem to understand that the best lines come quick, subtle and hit their mark. John Wick is a simple story of revenge shot against a dark, criminal landscape, but moves beyond the cliché. Do not misunderstand, this film is exceptionally violent, but the actions of Reeves are projected thorough the film with a force that is fuelled by well drawn supporting characters. Michael Nyqvist, Ian McShane and Willem Dafoe manage well orchestrated dialogue and fill in the necessary back story to quicken the pace of the film. They allow Reeves to be the action lead and he is only required to deliver memorable one liners. The quick linguistic delivery adds the needed levity for the audience to catch their breath.The film deserves its rating due to violence and language, but it does open the door to many conversation points. John Wick wrestles with the love and loss of his wife. Opening a door into the raw emotion that occurs in the life of a spouse that grieves. The loneliness, love and anger spins together into a mix that is not healthy in this film, but warrants consideration and discussion. Should people be given allowance during a time of trauma of the magnitude? The other significant plot point that should be considered is 'The Code.' When the movie moves to The Continental Hotel, things get interesting. This is a world where hit men and women go for a place of neutrality. Winston (Ian McShane) is the owner and stresses the code that underpins this violent world. Only those within the system seem to know the code and understand the penalties for breaking it, but the bigger question is who is the one who determines the code and how should justice be enacted? John Wick is merely another revenge film, but even the simplest of stories can open the door for the bigger questions of life and could even fuel conversation for those who regularly attend these films.Leaving the cinema... This is a simple, but well made film. Cinematic simplicity is a fine line. The creators of the film have to determine what to add or take away for the effectiveness of a film. Sometimes it works and sometimes it does not, but with John Wick it works. This was the right film to capitalise on Keanu Reeves strengths and was a fresh telling of a well worn story line.If you remember anything, don't mess with the dog!Reel Dialogue: What are the bigger questions to consider from this film? 1. Is revenge the answer to injustice? (Psalm 37: 27-29, Romans 12:17-21) 2. What is biblical justice? (Psalm 7:9, Romans 3:5-6) 3. Who determines right and wrong?

Keanu Reeves has starred in a good movie after a long time,"Keanu Reeves is back in form as "" John Wick "" and how. Keanu must have been waiting for a long time to play a role like this. Both John Wick's wife and the dog she had gifted him, get killed and he sets out to avenge their deaths. The movie is approximately an hour and a half long and comprises of some insane action sequences coupled with some amazing background music. And Keanu justifies playing a role like this all the more because his name is synonymous with "" The Matrix Trilogy"" and ""Speed"". Ever since the Matrix movies released I've always wanted Keanu to play meaningful action-oriented roles. Unfortunately he hadn't managed to bag such roles until he signed for this movie.Keanu's looks in this movie have been planned in accordance with the nature of his character and the trying times his character is shown to be going through.Also, another plus point of this movie is that the villains look menacing. In an 'out-an-out' action thriller like this, it's imperative that the villains look their parts and each and every one of them have played their parts to perfection. Willem Dafoe does a fantastic job as Marcus.So Keanu Reeves has been a part of a good movie after a long hiatus.

"Welcome Back, Mr. Reeves! Welcome Back!","Absolutely remorseless, purely unadulterated & downright violent from start to finish, John Wick is possibly the most stylishly crafted, feverishly paced, seamlessly executed, intensely entertaining & immensely satisfying action flick to come out from Hollywood after a very long time which, apart from marking a welcome return to action for Keanu Reeves, also triumphs as one of the biggest cinematic surprises of the year, not to mention the coolest by far.Very refined in its visual presentation, taking a no-holds-barred approach with its content & providing heavy doses of pulse-pounding entertainment that many viewers will want to revisit again n again, John Wick is amongst the most impressive looking motion pictures of the year that takes its simple premise to an unexpected high, thanks to its kinetic direction, breathtaking action, neat cinematography, slick editing & a magnificent lead performance from Keanu Reeves.The film tells the story of its titular character who used to be an ultimate assassin but retired to take care of his dying wife. Losing her to cancer, he receives a posthumous gift from her in the form of a puppy, with whom he eventually connects. Things are set in motion when few Russian thugs invade his home to steal his car but also end up beating him & killing his dog. And so the ex-hit-man comes out of his retirement to unleash carnage on the gangsters who took everything away from him.Produced & directed by the first time filmmakers in Chad Stahelski & David Leitch, who until now had worked in the film industry as stunt coordinators, John Wick marks a stunning directional debut for both of them & is a spectacular start to their filmmaking careers. And Derek Kolstad's screenplay doesn't waste much time in setting up its premise or introducing its characters & gets right down on business from the start by telling just enough about Wick to get the plot moving.Technically, there is a lot to admire about John Wick as the film exhibits an otherworldly setting for a revenge thriller that makes minimal use of elements not relevant to the plot. Camera-work makes its mark in the close-combat sequences for it provides a clear view of the carnage & isn't ruined by excessive editing or shaky cam. Editing paces the story with vicious velocity while its cool soundtrack further enhances the experience by remaining in tone with the film's events.Coming to the performances, the film features a capable cast in Keanu Reeves, Willem Dafoe, Michael Nyqvist, Alfie Allen, Ian McShane, John Leguizamo & others, amongst which both Reeves & Dafoe end up impressing the most. With a character that's tailor-made for his talent & combined with his magnetic screen presence, Reeves delivers a swashbuckling performance & easily steals the show. Dafoe follows him close & despite his short role, manages to leave his mark.Yet the best thing about John Wick remains its action sequences that are stupendously carried out. With its debutant directors already well-versed in the field of action choreography & stunt work, the two manage to add new freshness to the combat sequences by nicely blending its gunplay with grounded martial arts to single-handedly elevate John Wick into the league of cinema's finest action entertainers to come out in recent years.On an overall scale, John Wick is a smart, sophisticated & incredibly well-polished cinema that nicely balances its high-octane action & finely enacted drama to succeed as a potent, kinetic & relentless entertainer. Helmed by two new directors who understand what great action is about, boasting a script that knows where to draw the line & spearheaded by Keanu Reeves' badass performance, John Wick is an instant classic that comes as a must for every action film fanatic out there.Welcome back, Mr. Reeves! Welcome back!",,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
Razor-sharp hybrid of sizzling action and stylish noir,"The world of hitmen and mobsters is revitalized in this razor-sharp hybrid of sizzling action and stylish noir evocative of the old hard-boiled detective genre. Keanu Reeves is perfectly cast as the icy, superhuman hitman who finds himself making an involuntary comeback in the business after his wife dies and he falls victim to a violent burglary. Enter mega kill-mode! Naturally, Wick's skill is way beyond belief, and the film is willing to make every kind of concession in order to satisfy its own vanity, but it is so forward-moving and enterprising that it almost makes you believe it isn't completely self-centered and intrinsically cliché-ridden.

The Start of an insanely compelling series,"John Wick is such a unique film from others as it goes straight into the story without needing to fill in about characters slowly for the first portion. John Wick makes sure you know its about the action first and the story second but it works so well weirdly. You learn about these different aspects in this universe as compared to real life and it confuses you at first but you become comfortable with it eventually. The fight scenes are top tier with the cinematography being second to none. Though I can understand someone liking this film more I view it more as a perfect building block for the insane story ahead, keeping itself simple as to not over do you with what's yet to come. The antagonists were perfect for the movie but not perfect themselves as it felt purposeful to leave room for improvement in that area for the future movies.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"

Reeves plays the hero of the title, a legendarily immortal (almost Keyser Söze-like) hit-man who retired from the profession five years earlier when he fell in love. But his wife has just passed away, and some hot- headed Russian gangster (Game of Thrones' Alfie Allen) has foolishly interrupted his grieving by stealing his 1969 Ford Mustang, beating the snot out of him, and killing his dog. And you just don't mess with a man's dog. John Wick is back in business. Decked out in a natty black three-piece suit and a scruffy beard, Wick is a classic man of few words. He's Clint Eastwood minus the cheroot and the spaghetti. I'd be surprised if he speaks more than a dozen lines in the film. But when he opens his mouth, you can be damn sure he means what he says.

"Visually slick, a lot of fun","Ultimately, doesn't really amount to much in terms of substance. But the film clearly knows that, the filmmakers are very aware and they play it up to its maximum potential. Reeves actually makes for a solid action lead here, and the film does good with its incredible style by allowing a lot of quiet intensity to play out before the big action scenes. The film is incredibly stylized, so I could see that being a problem for many, but to me, completely reminiscent of Drive and everything that art-house action can do. I don't know how the film will hold up in the future, but as of now, I'm in sort of love. I highly recommend this, aesthetically very pleasing and also a lot of fun.",,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
Good story but didn't tell more about the main character,"I'm going to review this movie based on four things: The story, the cinema photography, and the characters.
The Story: well the story is based on revenge and it's interesting to see how these kind of story end up, but the annoying part is that all he is doing is just killing they could have just showed us a background of his story
Also I liked that he wont stop at nothing to get his revenge it shows us that he's detrement I really liked that about the story.
Character: Keanu Reeves played John Wick really well. his look, his hair are well suited, speaking of suits the suits in the movie look really good and it makes him look like a villain.
Most of the characters did a good job in the movie. Also I really enjoyed Keanu Reeves shooting skills he shoots like it's a real gun whcih is really nice .
cinema photography: They did a good job in terms of continuous shot while he was shooting people
The low light/ dark shots were nice not too dark no to bright
So yeah I gave it 8.0/10 since they didn't show more of his story rather they showwed more of him killing.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"

Great entertainment,"It's dumb fun, good dumb fun. Most of the issues with this movie are drowned out with the amazing action sequences, and the fast, exhibilirating pace. It has some creative use of color, and good cinematography, but what holds it down for me is only a few cliches, over exposition, and under developed characters. It could be more creative, with a movie like this you can do anything that fits the excitement, but some things are very basic, like the exposition, some times it does a great job at the ""show don't tell rule"", then right after has the characters talking about John Wick's back story instead of just showing us, like I would prefer. Either way, it is entertaining, and that's all it really needs to be.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
A ballet with guns and a brand new world.,"The directorial debut of Chad Stahelski, former stuntman of Keanu Reeves, is everything a fan of the genre, for a long time, has been expecting. With a beautiful choreographed violence, with very well made clichés and presenting a small new world of empathic criminals, creditors of dangerous deadly skills, John Wick is the name that everyone should know.Called to be the best action film of 2014, John Wick is a violent dance of bullet and blood that reflects all the years of experience of it's director as a stunt man and stunt coordinator. Each armed combat we have the opportunity to enjoy is wonderfully imagined, well polished and sublimely executed by a Reeves, that finally, is back, and apparently with a name that could have the title of legend. Filling the 101 minutes of pleasant clichés, Derek Kolstad delivers a script with a new and unique underworld, made out of rules that must be obeyed and a moral code that can be broken if the price is right. With a simple plot, good humor and a Keanu Reeves back to his days of anti-hero chosen by chance, John Wick is a possible franchise that should continue with its beautifully made clichés, that should exaggerate their camera movements and that should fill with cameos every table of that little new world.John Wick: 8/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
Point Blank range of goodness,"I really liked this film and was really not expecting to. Whenever Keanu Reeves dons a beard, he turns into this believable bad ass that is fun to watch. While I don't think the character of John Wick had really any amazing hand-to-hand fighting skills, his real skill was the point blank range shot. No hesitation, just one after another killed by his skill for doing this. It was quite brutal, I'll be honest, but nonetheless very effective. Theon Greyjoy was unrecognizable (at first) as the snotty son who thought he could get away with killing Wick's dog. I loved the whole hotel/safehouse aspect of the story, that was pretty cool. I haven't seen the sequel yet but I've been told it's better than the first one so I'm looking forward to seeing it soon.Overall, I would recommend this movie to action lovers for sure and maybe those who are looking for a good action movie because there hasn't been a good one in quite a while it seems.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
An excellent action film with involuntary humor and incredibly choreographed fight scenes help to coin a new (big) franchise of the genre,"Amid different representatives in action cinema such as the franchises Mission Impossible and Jason Bourne, a new example of extreme quality appears in this field of productions. Action films in the style of ""one-man army"" have not had much space lately, and when they appear they are not always very interesting. It is a formula that does not seem to be as attractive as it was a few years ago. But sometimes it still proves that it has the capacity to surprise. John Wick is now in theaters and gives the genre another good breath, even though it doesn't have anything very innovative to present. With Taken (Unrelenting Search), in which Liam Neeson embodies his father ""with specific skills"" in the hunt for his kidnapped daughter, the subgenre had already resurfaced. But with Keanu Reeves' John Wick, cinema has gained a new icon.John Wick (Keanu Reeves) was once one of the most feared killers in New York City, working in partnership with the Russian mafia. One day, he decides to retire, and in this period he has to deal with the sad death of his wife. The victim of a serious illness, she was already predicting her own death, and gave her husband a dog to care for in her grieving period. However, a few days after the funeral, the dog is killed by thieves who steal his car. John Wick sets out to seek revenge on these men he already knew very well, and who stole the last symbol of the woman he loved.John Wick is a film fully aware of the many clichés of revenge stories and retired killers that it recycles. The film marks the debut of Chad Stahelski and David Leitch as directors after work as background directors and stunt coordinators - although Leitch is not credited in the film. Both, however, had already worked with Reeves as a stuntman in the The Matrix trilogy. Stahelski not only repeats the character's name but also reproduces the most varied commonplaces of the genre - in the hope that, in the repetition, this cinema and this mythical hero of his will come to life in John Wick.The script does not offer anything original, being a very simple argument to trigger the subsequent action scenes. What stands out is the construction of the character: John's fame thanks to his past achievements guarantees him a legendary status among all murderers and mobsters. His nickname of Baba Yaga, the boogeyman, may seem cliché, but it is quoted in a striking dialogue between the mafia boss, Viggo Tarasov (Michael Nyqvist), and his son Iosef (Alfie Allen) and shows how a seemingly calm man it can be so terrible.The simple and direct script does not diminish the superb execution and the excellent action scenes that are presented during the work. It is interesting to observe the escape that the script makes from the cliché scenario, of justifying revenge for the death of the wife, but doing so, in a redundant way, for the murder of an animal given by the deceased woman. This attribution of the human to something inhuman seems to be purposeful from the beginning, since, intelligently, it is the basis of all the satire contained in the narrative. After all, who sees as humanly or humanly as possible everything the prodigious characters of action cinema are capable of doing? In John Wick, Wick's dehumanization by his opponents and admirers is such that it blinds him in appearance. All there is is the myth, beautiful choreographies of struggle and yes, a lot of blood and even boldness, but nothing nearly as scary or intimidating as to justify the manifests of dread that we see on screen through Reeves' physique, totally opposite to the characteristic of the productions to which it refers.In addition, the work is extremely effective in creating its own universe. John Wick is not an isolated product. There are other people in the business, like Marcus (Willem Dafoe) and Ms. Perkins (Adrianne Palicki). This underworld has its own currency and also a chain of hotels that provide specific services, managed by Winston (Ian McShane), in which it is forbidden to carry out missions. At a time when the film industry focuses on the creation of franchises, the unpretentious way that the film uses to sediment reality itself is admirable. Unlike other blockbusters, here the expansion of the plot is organic, so we want to know more details about its operation. However, more interested in the choreography of his man-to-man struggle with lightning in the background, and in his many shootings, John Wick is unable to see the implications of the things he recycles. He flirts with satire, treating this world of violence as a simulacrum (the hotel, the coins, the big cars), but ends up alienating it. The premise of this feature that satirizes the stereotype of the great killer of American cinema, which, alone, can handle armies (save Rambo and company), evokes this confusion between instinct, reason and emotion.The newcomers' approach to action scenes comes from their admiration for anime and martial arts films. Hong Kong's use of fighting choreographies and Hong Kong action cinema techniques were also influential in the production. Noteworthy is the tribute that John Wick pays for works such as The Killer by John Woo, Le Cercle Rouge and Le Samouraï by Jean-Pierre Melville, Point Blank by John Boorman and the spaghetti subgenre of the classic western films. David Leitch and Chad Stahelski, who bet on open plans and a more continuous edition during the action. The frantic camera movements and quick cuts that accompany fights - a technique widely used in order to give dynamism to the scenes while facilitating the filming of the action itself - give way to precise, calm filming. The action scenes represent one of the highlights of the film, maintaining a frantic and engaging pace and efficiently exploring the protagonist's skills. And it is impossible not to emphasize the stark contrast between the speed and objectivity that John demonstrates when he takes action and the almost apathetic way in which he first appears. It is as if the return to his old life gave him the gas he had lost after the tragedies he went through.Overall, the filmed action is extremely well elaborated and choreographed, with emphasis on the shooting sequence in the nightclub, the hand-to-hand fight in a room at the Continental hotel, the scene in which Wick coldly eliminates several Russian mafia gangsters in his automotive chase scene at the end of the plot. In addition, the Joel J. Richard and Tyler Bates soundtrack also has its good moments, effective in certain scenes of tension and knowing how to enjoy ambient songs - such as the contrasting cadenced and somewhat psychedelic theme during the sequence of an unrestrained fight by Wick in a nightclub.It is true, yes, that the actor demonstrates confidence, arrogance and uses catch phrases - in a performance, by the way, much more expressive than is customary for him - and the contrast between Reeves' appearance and his presence on camera only contributes to the creating even more hilarious situations. Thanks to this reinforced by the varied reactions of other characters to the killer, ranging from mystification, fear and exaggerated kindness, to passivity - especially the latter, which can be interpreted as a criticism of social inertia in the face of violence, when even an authority of the law prefers not interfere with Wick's actions. Michael Nyqvist also deserves due attention for his participation, as well as Willem Dafoe, and even Ian McShane in a simpler role. However, the spotlight is once again targeting Keanu Reeves, who naturally incorporates John Wick's dark and restrained personality.John Wick is not very different from today's cinema, with its fetish of violence that is extreme, but that does not leave marks, a normalized violence (""The neighbors are complaining about the noise, Mr. John Wick""). The film is not only exciting, but entertaining. The involvement of the plot and the absurd situations in which John is placed - as well as in all situations of the film that revolve around the fame that the character has among the murderers in the underworld - generates hilarious moments. Involuntary humor, however, natural, that captivates the viewer to embark more naturally on John Wick's vendetta and watch the hundreds of deaths that follow from then on. It is an excellent action film, with incredibly choreographed fight scenes. Still, its compelling storyline and solid cast performances help to coin a new (big) franchise of the genre.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"

"Tour-de-force in action choreography, but not much else","John Wick is the sort of film you only watch if you really like action movies... and I mean that you *really* have to like them. The choreography is great and really delivers that fantasy that John Wick is just an indestructible assassin.Unfortunately that's about all the movie has to offer.The plot is minimal, almost tacked-on. There is no character development. There is nothing this movie has to say. There is no intrigue, no drama, no comedy, no romance (thankfully). It's just one and a half hours of constant action choreography with a laughably weak ""video game"" plot. It like like watching someone play a video game. That may be your thing, but for me it wore very thin. By saying all that I almost feel like I've given away spoilers.What makes John Wick most disappointing though, is that Keanu's been in better action movies, with better action scenes, and with philosophical themes and social commentary. Like... ""The Matrix""? Compared to that movie, John Wick is very weak indeed as a piece of cinema. I don't understand why people rate it highly - although it works as a piece of cathartic release, or something to watch for ""Netflix and chill"" - where the point of the movie is not to actually watch it.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"

How much action is too much action?,"John Wick is a revenge drama which offers little along the lines of a story and and an excess of action. The story which starts off as interesting loses your attention almost as instantly. A retired hitman (or so they call him) single-handedly outmanoeuvres a flock of gangsters, including their boss.Performances: Keanu Reeves as the titular character carries the burden of almost everything that happens in the rather short run of 101 minutes of the movie. Alfie Allen (hey there, Reek!), Adrianne Palicki and Ian McShane are decent in portraying their characters. Michael Nyqvist shines as the baddie boss.Overall verdict: John Wick is another one of those stereotypical action movies, the only difference being that there is way too much action and gravity-defying stunts stuffed into it.

Definitely worth watching - Writing to help the idiots who didn't understand the movie,"First of all this is a pure action movie, so obviously its gonna be unrealistic, actor have to survive rt?.First review for the retards who saw the movie and rated 1*.1.Movie is about an ex hit-man (obvio)= retired, so in the movie like the character says ""he is rusty"", and thus when the fellas break-in to his house he got hit, the first hit was on the BACK. of his HEAD.

101 minutes of Keanu Reeves laying out henchmen after henchmen in a revenge thriller,"John Wick stacks the body count in a wickedly fun revenge thriller starring Keanu Reeves about a retired assassin drawn back to a previous life of murder and violence after a vicious break-in and theft led by a Russian mobster's son. Despite a thin script, 101 minutes of gratuitous violence ultimately pays off due to sheer spectacle, some stylish direction, and incredible action set pieces.Keanu Reeves has never been known as an actor with a wide range but instead limited to certain roles that show little emotion. As a character, John Wick is perfectly suited for Reeves. Characterized as an unassuming quiet, grieving widower, Wick is actually a no-nonsense former assassin in retirement after finding love. Coupled with director Chad Stahelski, a veteran stuntman and coordinator, and Reeves' history of playing badass male leads, this is the film to take Keanu Reeves back to previous career highs not seen since The Matrix trilogy and which would go on to launch a successful and critically well-received franchise. Reeves owns the role of Wick. The casting couldn't be more perfect.Primarily, John Wick is centered on loss and revenge. Wick is out for blood against the people who took away everything important in his life. As an exploration of the aforementioned themes, the film only goes skin-deep, failing to dig deeper into the character's persona and background. Majority of Wick's history is shown through flashbacks and subtle dialogue. While the script leaves a lot to be desired, the character interactions aren't preachy, grounding the film on an emotional and human level. More importantly, Wick does not really grow as a character. He's not placed in a situation that questions his motives allowing room for him to grow.The film takes its themes seriously, but perhaps intentionally, it's also a satire on the futility and value of masculinity. Characters within the film present this dual approach of tackling a subject matter common in Hollywood cinema. Iosef Tarasov, played by Alfie Allen, embraces hypermasculinity with his arrogant, selfish and entitled personality being the son of Russian Mobster Viggo Tarasov, played by Michael Nyqvist. John Wick is the exact opposite with a laid back attitude. Iosef initiates the plot of the film when he and his group conducted a vicious burglary that beat Wick, ransacked his home, killed his dog left behind by his deceased wife, and stole his treasured car. Unknowingly to him, Wick formerly works for his father and is nicknamed ""Baba Yaga"", Russian for ""Boogeyman."" As Wick hunts down Iosef, the opposite occurs between the characters as Iosef's toxic hypermasculinity is exposed as fraudulent when faced with an actual credible threat. Wick finds again the machismo he once discarded.Themes of loyalty, word of honor and brotherhood are also present. Marcus, played by Willem Dafoe, is Wick's mentor and friend. Hired by Viggo to kill Wick, he broke the contract when another assassin, Ms. Perkins, comes in and vies for the prize, probably also out of mutual respect. He is tortured then murdered when Viggo learns of his betrayal. Ms. Perkins is killed for breaking The Continental's policy of no ""business"" transaction within hotel grounds. Lastly, Viggo is killed by Wick by protecting his son. In the criminal underworld, death is the ultimate fate.John Wick's strengths are its direction and fight scenes. For lovers of neo-noir, Spaghetti Westerns and Hong Kong martial arts cinema, Chad Stahelski has great command, specifically in the cinematography department, in paying homages to his film's influences bringing a unique testosterone-charged modern twist of the genres. The score is also great from Tyler Bates, containing a mix of techno and rock music.The sequel has lots of potentials that the first has failed to tackle. Put a heavier emphasis on character development, not just lip-service dialogue. Here's to hoping it exceeds the first.6/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"

Destroying Convention with Gun-Fu,"John Wick reinvigorates the action genre with its sleek style, expertly choreographed fight sequences and a surprisingly rich world of underground assassins. What could have been a run-of-the-mill revenge flick instead stands out through its precision, atmosphere and commitment to practical stunt work.Keanu Reeves delivers a perfectly measured performance, embodying John Wick with a quiet intensity that makes every moment feel lived-in. The film wastes no time with unnecessary exposition, instead immersing viewers in a neo-noir setting filled with unspoken rules and intriguing side characters. The action is relentless, but it's shot and edited with clarity - far from the over-cut, shaky-camera mess that plagues modern action films.While the story itself is simple, John Wick thrives on its execution, proving that style, world-building, and commitment to craft can elevate even the most straightforward of narratives. It's a must-watch for action fans and a testament to how carefully designed choreography can make every fight scene feel like an art form.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"

See the film for what it is.,"I went into the film not expecting anything ground breaking, I was just expecting a 'standard' action flick, but what I got was an hour an a half of no holds barred action and killing. The storyline really wasn't the best.. it was a dog, but hey. I don't normally watch a lot of action films, but I'm glad I watched this. Some of it was laughable, and indeed I did laugh countless times just at the sheer amount of badass kills and fights. (The headshots are shockingly great!) It plays out kind of like a video game, there's crazy kills and boss battles...Take the film for what it is, it was a good watch. Imo, best action film I've seen in a long time, there was no time to be bored. [8/10]",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"

Way way  over the top... and i love it!!,"Let me start by saying this movie is not for everyone, it has a lot of violence and the story is very thin.So why do i love it do you say? I grew up with the over the top movies of the 80's like Commando,Rambo and so on. I loved those when i was young, if i watch them now i can't make it further then 10 minutes but John Wick took me back to those times.In recent years a lot of directors tried to make a movie like this and failed simply because they took themselves too seriously. John Wick just is what it is, a very violent movie without any pretense to being more. The direction is great, the production is great, the acting is good. It takes me back to the movies of my youth.Of course this is isn't the best movie ever made, Michael Nyqvist shouldn't be in a Hollywood production in my opinion and what i don't like of the modern movies is the very obvious CGI wounds and blood, it is just not good and very distracting.But i give this movie a solid 8, i really enjoyed it, don't expect too much just relax and watch it",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
"""John Wick is a movie that know it self really well and don't try to be other things makes it fun and entertaining to watch all the time""","After his role as Director and Actor in Man of Taichi and Actor in 47 Ronin which both are pretty bad Keanu Reeves are back to his greatest zone which is ""Action Movie"" i can still remember picture of him as Neo in the matrix.The thing that makes John Wick stand-out from others Action movie is , it know itself really well it know that this movie will be an Action shoot everything and Keanu Reeves as a bad-ass characters , so it don't try to be other things like insert too much drama story and this make John Wick fun and entertaining to watch because it give the audience what they really want.Keanu Reeves himself is also really bad-ass in this movie , i think this role is perfect for him i can't think any others actor to play this role other than him , it's like this script and this role just wrote for him and him only , so i have to say after watched this movie Keanu Reeves is back guys he's official back to bad-ass now !!.Also another actor that i personally really like in this movie is Michael Nyqvist as a main villain after i saw him in Abduction and Mission Impossible : Ghost Protocol i have to say that this is by far his best performance as a main villain , he added so much to the characters making it interesting and fun to watch.There's also a lot of supporting cast and some are really cool like Adrianne Palicki , Williem Dafoe or even Ian Mcshane which is really cool and added so much more worth of your ticket price.Overall John Wick is a really fun action movie , it doesn't bring a great script or great story telling but it give us just what we want from action movie and don't try to be other things things , if you're a fan of action movie or Keanu Reeves just go and watch it you will not be disappointed .",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
Greatest action movie since Taken 1.,"I just finished watching this movie.I can only say that I tremendously enjoyed it from start to finish. It is one of Keanu Reeve's best performances since Speed and the movie itself is exceptionally good...I repeat. Exceptionally good.If you liked Taken 1 (Liam Neeson) then you will love this. I would have to even say this is a notch better than Taken 1 as it has a lot more action and the fight sequences are very well done.Anyone that says this movie is bad or complains about the plot or acting etc. needs a reality check. Action movies have never been known for their story lines and all the drama etc., it's an action flick so it won't win any big Oscars for acting etc. but it will give you a thrilling joyride.I highly recommend this movie and congratulations to the film and crew on making this instant classic.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
made for Keanu Reeves,"John Wick (Keanu Reeves) is a reformed assassin but his beloved who reformed him has died. After her death, she sends him a dog to love. Then the impetuous Iosef (Alfie Allen), son of mob boss Viggo Tarasov (Michael Nyqvist), steals his car and kills his dog. Iosef doesn't know what he's gotten himself into. Viggo tries to kill John and places a $2 million contract on him. He gets John's old colleges Marcus (Willem Dafoe) to agree. John goes to the Continental hotel where assassins congregate and nobody is allowed to do business. John finds Iosef there while Viggo doubles the reward to break the house rule. Ms. Perkins (Adrianne Palicki) takes him up on his offer.Keanu Reeves has become an expert in playing this type of characters. There are great looking action. The best is his fight with Palicki. It's all amazingly shoot. The simple story is better than most with some nice touches. I do have a couple of small problems with the plot. I don't like that he kept missing Iosef in the hotel because he had shown that he almost never misses. I don't mind not killing Iosef so early. He just needs to scamper away before the shooting starts. I also don't understand why Wick doesn't get reprimanded by the hotel. That kind of stuff does bug me a little but overall, it's a fun action movie.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"

He's Wicked alright,"This movie doesn't take itself seriously and that is exactly how a viewer should approach it. Keanu Reeves can act no matter what some people say. I can't picture any other actor in this role, that's how good he is. My only complaint is there aren't enough explosions. The plot is silly but that's the point. It almost seems as if Quentin Tarantino wrote and directed it. One gets that Tarantino vibe while watching. It's a perfect action movie with a few laughs thrown in between. John Wick is one bad-ass dude that you don't want to cross and he doesn't leave things unresolved. Eat popcorn, shut down your brain and you'll have a great time.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
Best action film in years,"When i fist saw the trailer of this film i had mixed reviews, I didn't really know what to think of it as the idea behind the whole film sounds childish and i thought the storyline will be very weak, but boy this film topped my expectations. The way Keanu Reeves own this ""John Wick"" character, humble but really confident, ready to have his revenge at all cost makes the movie worth every minute, and as it goes on and on, the plot gets clearer and clearer.

John Wick: The Industrial Grim Reaper,"Every generation of men had their own action hero archetype. In the 50s and 60s they had Western gunslingers like Clint Eastwood and John Wayne. As opposed to the jungle soldiers of Sylvester Stallone and Arnold Schwarzenegger.One facet of these films that I feel are not often brought up are the settings. In the Westerns of the past they were commonly set in barren deserts or the high plains of the United States. Whereas the aforementioned eighties by comparison, where often set in foreign jungles like Vietnam.John Wick in many ways marches to the beat of it's own drum. Firstly by giving the retired assassin a incredibly emotional reason to return to his former life. As well as by utilizing a modern industrial environment to enhance the gun fights.Besides just aiding the fight scenes, this setting is built up. By introducing to the audience already established world building elements. That really makes the world feel lived in. Such as the body disposal men, The Continental Hotel, and finally the implied existence of The High Table. And all of this is even further fleshed out in future entries.There are a multitude of reasons why this film is phenomenal. But the final of which I have to mention is the cinematography. Which is brilliantly used to hide Wick in shadows until his efficient kills. Giving him an almost other worldly presence on screen. Like that of an urban grim reaper.",,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
Fun for the right reasons.,"Leitch and Stahelski make a wonderful team directing and producing what is overall a passably fun action film. The two have done stunts in many, many films and their understanding of good action choreography really comes to light in John Wick. The numerous fights are fast, frenetic and creative.Reeves is certainly at the best he's been in a while, but don't expect to be blown away. The catatonic nature that has held him since the mid '00s seems to be fading away. Just reference this and 47 Ronin (2013) and the fantastic Reeves directed Man of Tai Chi (2013).The rest of the cast seems to be having fun, especially Dafoe who cameos as an aging hit-man. Nyqvist is the other standout in the bunch, delightfully adding dark comedy to his bits rambling about the dangerous John Wick. There is no doubt that this is Reeves' show, but everyone else doesn't seem to be just phoning it in.The set design and the cinematography are absolutely fantastic. Action scenes are held in intricately detailed environments, most notably a neon-washed nightclub scene that will really dazzle your eyes. The color palates are suitably washed, with sudden bursts of color such as in the aforementioned night club.Where everything production-wise comes together correctly, the writing seems to be what holds this down from being an action classic. It is at times witty and engaging, yes, but its mainly a mish-mash of tired clichés to string you along its gorgeous set pieces. The revenge story is one of the oldest in cinema. Hybridizing it with the ""you killed my dog, now you'll pay"" trope was clever, but ultimately not enough to stand out.In the end, John Wick is a fun flick worth watching with a group of friends. Don't expect much cerebrally, but be sure to keep a sharp eye for the rich detail put into every frame of this well- crafted action film.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
#JohnWick,"I walked out of the theater feeling great. I felt like it was worth the money and time. In fact, it is the best movie of 2014 for me, personally. I had wished for characters in the past to be more FULL of human emotions and act out on those emotions because that is what makes me connect to a character. I want to despise villains, and I got to do that. I wanted to sit through the whole movie without checking the time on my led lit watch. I did. This is a complete movie and doesn't leave much to ponder about the what ifs. The story rolls quite quickly which is great because sometimes I wish I had a remote control to press forward when I watch some movies. All characters are great. The plot is great. The script is amazing. The cinematography, oh my oh my!

Great flick!Keanu Reeves must make more movies like this one!!!!!#JohnWick",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
Non stop monotony--beautifully filmed but a linear plot,"John Wick (2014)I thought the weak point of this movie would be Keanu Reeves, since he's not the best actor in town. But instead it was the monotony of the killing, on and on, all at the same pace, with hardly a break.I'm not complaining about violence here—that's what this kind of revenge movie is all about. Reeves plays a guy who used to be a trained assassin, one of the best, and he has to come out of retirement (you'll see why in the first ten minutes). And he is now after some of the people he once worked for, so they are formidable foes, and cruel.But that's about it. The process of getting even takes up the rest of the movie, and there are the necessary clubs and warehouses, the muscle car antics and the flipping and diving while shooting your guns with perfect accuracy. Mostly there is just shooting and fighting and fighting and shooting.So, how to make a movie that has this one-liner idea work? With psychology, cleverness, surprise, and even failure sometimes. You won't see any of that here. You also won't see humor. By luck, the preview for my showing (in a theater) was ""Die Hard,"" and what a reminder of a terrific action movie, where one guy has to kill a whole slew of enemies. But there it's funny, there are constant twists and turns, and you actually care about the hero.That's another problem here: you care about Mr. Wick because he was wronged at the start, but he's not a sympathetic person. You just don't really worry about him. I suppose you know he won't die right away, so you are ""on his side"" more or less, but not with much investment. In a weird way, some of the villains were more compelling than Wick—the main bad guy is a terrific Michael Nyqvist (who is always really good), and Willem Dafoe plays a terrific small, key part.I might have left a movie this straight forward if it weren't for one thing—it's photographed well. The camera, light, and generally the editing, are all elegant and almost pretty, in a good way. The sets are filmed in a logical way that moves you through the spaces through the eye of the camera with confidence and dark beauty. Good stuff, and it had my eyes glued.Now give the thing something more and glue the rest of me.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"

Quality Action.,"Yep, this is a good action film, kind of simple, but good. The action in this film is enough to keep action movie fans happy. It didn't have long boring scenes that would have you sitting around waiting for some action to start. It was perfectly done, much like ""Predator"" or ""The Equalizer"" or, better yet, ""The Matrix"". In fact, while watching this film I was reminded of the ""Matrix"" a time or two. No mystery why. The acting was done well too. There were a few familiar faces from the small screen(HBO) as well. All of the characters were convincing and believable. John Wick(Keanu Reeves) is an ex-hit-man who is forced to come back to work to find the people who took everything from him. Like I said, it's simple but it's good.

Keanu's Back with a Vengeance,"The career of Keanu Reeves seemed to have taken a nosedive after the success of the Matrix films. We would be hard put to name even one film after that. Last year, he directed a martial arts film called Man of Tai Chi, where he played antagonist to a less than charismatic leading man. That did not fly too high, except perhaps for some hardcore action fans. For this year though, the buzz for this film ""John Wick"" was simply too high to ignore.The plot is ripped off the plots of many other old-fashioned action films, especially those from the 1980s. JOhn Wick is a retired hit man. He is still very depressed about his wife's death. One day, a group of thugs break into John's house and destroy his wife's one most precious gift to him. John finds out the perpetrator Iosef is the crazy spoiled son of his old boss, Viggo. John then goes on a deadly revenge rampage until no one is left alive.Yes, there is not much about that script to be excited about. However, for their first directorial effort, David Leitch and Chad Stahelski, the stunt coordinators for Keanu Reeves in ""Matrix"", make a spectacular debut. Their action sequences were fast-clipped, very exciting and relentlessly brutal. Be it gunplay, knife-play or martial arts, Keanu Reeves made a perfect action hero.A lot of this film's success also comes because of Reeves' excellence in dramatic acting. Okay, so there only few of those moments. We will remember fondly his devotion to his wife, which Reeves was able to project very well without words. He was sincerely in those touching scenes.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
A Very Refreshing Role To See Reeves In,"Never wrote a review before but felt to on this for a specific reason. Keanu Reeves....I swear everything I see him in, while most of the movies I enjoy, his characters in them I usually don't...they all seem to come from the same type of mold...all rather coldish in some aspect, dryish stale, not saying he's a bad actor, he just seems to always be the same person in everything...maybe it's just me. This is why up until this movie, my favorite character of his was always Ted in the Bill & Ted movies cause he is so different from the other characters he's played.Firstly, this is one heck of an action movie, I kept finding myself sad whenever I thought it was just about to end, just to have another action packed scene come in instead and be joyous again..lol. The soundtrack is Epic (for me anyways...I'm a musician with a similar style so it really stood out for me.)Reeve's character though....reminded me a little somewhat of him in Constantine...only in that in both he's a bit hard/cold good/bad guy, but in a totally different way in each of them...I don't know if it's just his unshaven, badass look in this movie, or his acting, but I didn't feel like, ""Oh, this is just Keanu Reeves again,"" and more like, ""This is John Wick."" Meaning the character itself stood out so much more, if that makes sense. May sound silly to some. I also love the way how he's so precise in his movements when going after people. I so wish I had gotten to see this in the theater.Sure there may not be a whole lot to the story, it's simple and whatnot, but for the person going into this wanting pure action such, this is perfect.I heard a lot of bad reviews stating ""oh this has been done over and over, it's old, nothing new, seen it before, blah blah blah."" But...take 3 movies, all very high grossing...Dances With Wolves, The Last Samurai, and Avatar....all 3 have a similar premise which is mostly why haters of Avatar disliked it...said it was too much like Dances With Wolves....I kinda thought The Last Samurai fit that premise too, but love that movie nevertheless and unless I just haven't heard it or something, I've never heard people dis The Last Samurai like that...meaning I think people went into Avatar expecting something like even more complex, bigger, different in whatever way they were hoping for....I think the same happens here with John Wick...even though it has a good rating, all the bad things I hear about it are almost all the same.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
Action scenes!,"Keanu Reeves is absolutely solid, as is everyone else. The action scenes are among the best I've ever seen. Stylised, but realistic. John Wick, the character, is insanely good and insanely tough, but not in an effortless way. That makes it seem more real.The grittiness of the action scenes also adds to them.Choreography is brilliant, cinematography is beautiful. These action scenes have a clear ""flow"", i.e. don't degenerate into a collection of fast moving extreme close-ups. The storytelling may be simple, but extremely well done in a visual way. All exposition scenes are visual and most contain little or no dialogue.So I liked this one!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
Don't Believe the Hype,"How can I describe the movie John Wick in comparison to other action films, average at best, more mediocre than average. This movie starts of very strong, with a plot that seems like it is about to elevate this movie into something more than just another action flick. It almost looks like it will delve into that rarely seen realm of an action flick with a decent story. Then it gets about halfway through and becomes so very predictable and rather boring. I rarely use the word boring even describing average to mediocre action films but that is exactly what happens to this movie about halfway through. How can a movie full of action be boring is something the people who made this film should ponder. I cannot really blame the cast as they all were pretty good in their roles, the story was just straight booty after the halfway point. This is a prime example of a movie that should have ended like 40 minutes prior to when it did. When the main character achieved his goal is when it should have ended but the just had to add on another 40- 60 minutes of movie which just made everything up to that point seem like a wasted effort. Shame on the writers, directors, financiers, and all the behind the scenes magic that made this movie for not realizing this movie was headed into the absurd realm sooner. You would be better suited spending your cash on almost ANY other movie at the box office this weekend if you insist on seeing this film. The saddest part of this is that Keanu Reeves (and all the cast) actually did some pretty good acting in this film, not his usual phoning it in. Anybody who says this movie is more than a below average action movie is not somebody who has seen the movie or a person with poor film taste.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
John Wick - Kicks A**,"Before I start, I feel I have to state that John Wick is more than just another Popcorn Movie. Its stunning choreography, seamless switching-up of fighting styles and without a doubt; its cast, are impeccable. Reminiscent of other revenge thrillers such as 'Taken,' and 'The Man from nowhere;' John Wick enthrals the audience with it's visuals while keeping you connected with it's personal performances. Keanu Reeves was born to play the part of John Wick; the nice, quiet guy with a big dark secret. If you're looking for a movie you need to watch twice to fully grasp it's countless layers and subplots; go watch Memento, or Donnie Darko. If you're looking for a movie you want to watch twice because you have to show your buddy what a bada** Keanu Reeves' is; then look no further.

Stylish (over-)sophistication,"I have always regarded Keanu Reeves a great actor, but some of his choices/opportunities have been bizarre - mildly speaking. Fortunately, John Wick puts Reeves back on track again - he is the real ""filler"" in this movie, there are a few short scenes without his presence, and quite often he is the only personality visible on screen. True, one can find similarities with his character in e.g. Matrix and A Scanner Darkly, and the plot has several flaws and airy-fairy moments, but all this is presented in a stylish and witty manner, with both multiple angles and endings. Reeves/Wick is a gloomy and firm man, his deeds are certain and final, yet dog- and wife-related scenes are nice and touching. And the locality of Hotel Continental is unconventional.Apart from Reeves, there are many other distinctive performances as well, practically all who have verbal roles. Michael Nyqvist (as Viggo Tarasov) is a due antagonist to Reeves; rather frequently, there is no proper confrontation because the ""bad guy"" is more versatile/fascinating than the ""good guy"" (or vice versa).All in all, the movie in question is no Tarantino, but yet a good entertaining action with pleasant performances.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
Brave New Franchise,"In John Wick, writer Derek Kolstad and director Chad Stahelski have finally found a use for Keanu Reeves: Placeholder. This is a relatively watchable action/revenge picture with a title character that could have as easily been portrayed by a cereal box as an actor.The good news is Reeves makes a great cereal box. He doesn't have to speak, and barely has to act.The mood and style of the picture are well accomplished, and the plot is straight linear: widower, retired hit man John Wick is out for revenge on the Russian mob punk who stole his car and killed his dog. Since Reeves is at his best when he is not speaking, there is plenty of time for him to slaughter a boatload of Russian mobsters in pursuit of said revenge. And the actions scenes are well executed. (Pun intended.)The film is enhanced by some well placed characters, well crafted by fine actors. Ian MchShane, Willem Dafoe, John Leguizamo, and Dean Winters all turn in well drawn, interesting and amusing characters whenever there is a break in the action. Bridget Moynihan plays Wick's flashback wife in a kind of gratuitous cameo. Not much to do for her, though what little she has to work with is done well.There is already talk of John Wick becoming a ""franchise.""The producers might do well to take a cue from the Bond films and rotate the role of the title character. There are plenty of actors out there who can actually act.In the meantime, this debut is damn good fun.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"

Nobody does it better Mr. Reeves.,"Keanu Reeves reprises his role as a suave and chillingly cold human annihilator in this flick. The movie has been directed by Chad Stahelski , a stunt coordinator and stuntman having contributed his talent and professional services in movies like The Matrix , Van Helsing, Point Break, Die Hard 4.0 , Rambo (a Burma) etc.In view of the above it is abundantly clear and painfully obvious that John Wick features impressive action scenes, well oiled stunts and fairly violent imagery. As is the case with with most Keanu Reeves filcks, the movie has a dark and an almost grimy feel to it.The story however is fairly straightforward much unlike The Matrix (which I consider to be a huge relief, since unintelligible plots are overrated) . It is a revenge saga and employs some very typical elements to accommodate a lavish quantum of bullets and blood .The soundtrack is impressive and adds zing to the pace of the movie . Talking about pace, the movie is not very slow but some sequences seem stretched , which is really surprising given the short run time of the movie (barely 100 minutes). But the action is well directed and hence we can overlook this blemish.It is an entertaining action movie devoid of any psychological complexity or ""grey"" areas. If you are a Reeves fan do watch it for he has done a good job in this movie as well. The tags I would would like to see in this movie are Cold/Dark/Suave/Reeves-of course.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"

Awesome Action Movie!,"John Wick is an awesome movie with action packed scenes which gives me an excitement. The story is so good, it tells about how john's life go through after his retirement as a hitman.Iosef and the gang stole his car and killed his dog. John got his weapons especially his sidearm to takedown those enemies.Viggo tells his son that John Wick is a hitman and he will come for him no matter where he go.What I like about the film is the revenge scene which he finally killed Iosef.Keanu Reeves' acting skills and action stunts makes the film more epic and amazing.Overall it was such a good film 10/10.",,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
Well Done Hit-Man Movie,"Mob hit-man John Wick (Keanu Reeves) promised his wife he would quit the business and he does so for 5-years. Then she dies and for him not to be alone she had arranged for a Beagle puppy delivered to him at home. Then the son of mob boss Viggio (Michael Nyqvist) - who John Wick used to work for - wants his car ( a souped-up 1969 Mustang ) beats him up and kills the puppy. John Wick recovers and knows what he has to do. Let the games begin.Most hit-man stories have the hit-man (or a narrator) tell about his life and the specific numbered rules he lives by. And during the time of the movie, we will see this hit-man break every rule he has. This time it's different. This time it's pure revenge. We don't know the rules John Wick used to live by. But make no mistake about all this, now John Wick is out to make things righthis way (get chills saying that?).To be clear we learn that everyone, including Viggio, is afraid of John Wick, but Viggio must protect his son from John Wick.The rest of the movie is a well-orchestrated choreography of gun fights. Some special effects regarding vehicles are included and are quite good. The cinematography in this gun-fest is also quite good. The music is non-stop heart pounding throughout.Hit-man Marcus (Willem Dafoe) is contracted by Viggio to take out John Wick. This is insurance in case Viggio's men don't get the job done.Keanu Reeves is the right actor for this movie. As John Wick, he doesn't talk much but his stares speak volumes (don't forget his guns too). In fact, I have always seen Keanu Reeves as the right actor for any movie he is in. After his character's beating when the car and the dog were gone I felt his pain and loss.Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: Yes, not much.Rating: B",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
John Wick is just another revenge film.,"When you see John Wick, you're thinking, this is another revenge film and this can only end in one way. So whatever way, you're thinking it's going to end, that's the way it's going to end.John Wick is about a man, a retired hit-man, who lost his wife before having a puppy in his possession because it is the last gift she gives him, but when everything is taken away from him, he's out for blood and yeah, it's personal.It was good to see Keanu Reeves back and actually making you believe his character was a hit-man once in his life. It wasn't much speaking. It was all about the fight scenes. It became nonstop and didn't slow down. It's definitely a step up from 47 Ronin.In a way, this film will remind you of The Equalizer, BUT The Equalizer was a lot better. It was still a good film for Reeves, and hopefully, we'll see him again like this.If you need a film for this weekend, something to have you on the edge of your seat and just enjoying an adrenaline rush, go see John Wick.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"

Best Dance Movie I've Seen in Some Time,"Since the plot is so lacking in substance (the old, you killed my wife and my dog bit), we must look to other things to find positive. First of all, Keanu Reeves is pretty good on screen, and plays an interesting avenger. The bad guys seem to have an endless supply of stupid employees who allow their heads to be blown off. Sounds stupid? But the directing and movement of the characters during the incredibly long scenes of destruction are quite amazing. It's sort of a Kill Bill thing. Anyway, it is engaging. I did like that cast. The kid that was in Game of Thrones (who was eviscerated in that show) was a nice foil for Wick. We also have the fellow who is Mayhem in the insurance commercials. Of course, there are enough loose ends for the sequels (which number two at this point). I probably won't bother if they just have more of the same.

"Keanu, a focused, bad ass!","Yesterday I saw the first matinée showing of John Wick. Like I anticipated, judging by reviews, it was well worth my time. However, what I didn't anticipate was how ordinary the story was. We've seen this type of story many times where the Hero has an excuse to kill a lot of people.What separates John Wick from other films of this type is it's style. I don't remember seeing people get shot in the head and then blood splatter in such a way. Many times this happened, and it's very effective. But more than anything, it's Keanu Reeves' focus that makes this movie special.Many times I'll watch a film, and look to see the actor, ""acting"", or just going through the motions for a paycheck. The last Indiana Jones adventure comes to mind. But throughout every frame of John Wick Keanu Reeves is 100% focused on the character. In the fight scenes, many of them, I never saw a stunt man. That was Keanu, potent, violent, and effective.For me, the movie could have used a little more exposition, i.e a little more Bridget Moynahan, and a little more of his bonding with the dog. There probably was in the original cut, but I'm sure some hotshot exec said ""cut all that stuff out. They just wanna see Keanu kick ass!"" But don't get me wrong. This film is a must see, for stylized action sequences and particularly, Keanu Reeves' performance. The latter is really something to see.",,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
"Simple, Yet Effective; If Well Shot Action is What You Like, John Wick Delivers","John Wick is a simple action story with elements that we've all seen before, and nothing about it is groundbreaking or particularly intriguing in terms of the story or performances, so if you cannot value an action film for its set pieces, choreography, and stunt work, then this film isn't for you.For action fans, I would definitely recommend it, the camera work is still yet dynamic, and allows us to see a great view of the action while not obscuring anything that happens. All of the action scenes are quick, to the point, brutal, and have consequences for all characters involved. John Wick isn't presented as invincible, just highly skilled and lucky. His character has been out of the assassination game for over 5 years, and that makes Keanu Reeves playing the part a bit more of an easier pill to swallow. Although I might want to bite my own tongue here, because for a man nearing 50, he carried out every scene to the letter and in my opinion was more tough and convincing than he ever was in any of The Matrix films here.I saw influence from another great 00's action flick, The Man from Nowhere, which if you haven't seen but enjoyed this, I would highly recommend.John Wick has a lot of style, the locations are spectacular, I often found myself asking ""Where did they find this place?"" Gorgeous Victorian and old school architecture to high tech modernized homes, you really feel that you've covered a lot of ground watching this. Another element of the style is the world it takes place in. It's a very stylized, slick graphic novel type alternate reality, where coded language, an honor code amongst assassins, and even secret resources and hotels for them is all the norm.The film doesn't treat any of this as strange and takes you along into this bizarre world, revealing more and more at a time, while including things such as John Wick running out of ammo multiple times to keep it refreshingly grounded.Again, in terms of writing, story, or acting, this isn't a critic's dream. I saw this with a friend on a lazy Saturday morning after having some Waffle House, I feel that is exactly how this movie is meant to be enjoyed.As an added note, as a martial artist myself, I appreciated the use of Judo and Jiu-Jitsu on film, most movie fight scenes are 90% striking based and are afraid to show ground and grapple work. Good on them for not being shy of it.John Wick gets a 7 out of 10 for slick, well choreographed action and a quirky, dark humour sheen, complete with a high body count.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
"Extremely entertaining, and satisfying revenge tale","The film is lean, mean, effective and satisfying. If you are in the mood and itching for a brainless revenge tale and over the top action, John Wick will scratch that itch.Granted, as it was mentioned by others, there are plot holes and sequences that defies logic and common sense. But a movie is a movie, it is like a fantasy that plays out on a big screen. Ask yourself, does any of your fantasies stand against the trial of logic? I guess not. So lets move on.John Wick was lethal and ruthless professional hit man, and he was known for that. But he got out and he got comfortable. That's why in the beginning of the movie, he was a little slow and rusty. That was not a plot hole or scripting error. But as he step back into the dark world of the past, he started remembering and picking up the pace. He's becoming the legendary John Wick again right on the screen. And you feel that, and that is damn satisfying.Keanu Reeves is John Wick! His woodiness and dead eye stare adds to overall feel of a killing machine that he was. Different from the roles he played before, he's more mature, more weathered. The sign of aging and roughness of his appearance now made him perfect for John Wick, and his usual arrogance and stubbornness just made John Wick more bad ass and fearless. He's perfectly dressed for cocktail party, but he kills like a rabid dog on drugs. He's effective and merciless, he cuts right to the point and no bullshit. He rarely talks. When he does open his mouth, nothing fancy or philosophical comes out. He wants revenge and he makes sure that he gets it. I don't know about you but I dig that. It's like a breath of fresh air. No more melodramatic moral dilemma. When all you had was taken away from you, you want to be John Wick, no freaking question asked!This film has the style of noir and carnage of manga. It is not big on logic, but it is what it is: a no bullshit and no brainer revenge tale. You want to mess with me? Okay, let's see if I kill you all, how you are going to mess with me now?",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"

Just another action film in which my easily impressed friend announced was his new favorite movie.Turns out, it was actually pretty enjoyable. Sure it doesn't have a deep plot or interesting characters, but it has a twist on modern action movies that I haven't really seen. I don't want to spoil anything, but it was actually quite humorous. I found the over-the- top-ness to be quite entertaining. The action is good, nothing special though. Typical action movie action. EXCEPT! John Wick reloads his gun! That's right, this action movie is not only creative, but realistic! Now that's a rarity in action movies these days.Overall, John Wick is different, and it scores points on that level. However, the ending was forced which really took away from the experience, and the action, plot, and characters really aren't anything special (except John Wick reloads), which is where it loses points.

"An Execellent Return to form for Keanu Reeves,","John Wick is a good movie with a very well developed storyline and a great cast. It's a simple action movie that never wants to be anything more than that, it never gets too complicated, it's story is easy to follow and the action sequences are amazingly choreographed, it's a huge surprise to know that it's made by two first time directors, because they already seem like professionals. I felt the movie needed more depth, though I did certainly feel certainly feel for the main character, they glossed over the story about his wife, it should have been more constructed, it's only an hour and forty minutes long, and they easily could have added an extra fifteen minutes to develop their relationship some more. The performances are excellent, there are some top class acting from the likes of Michael Nyqvist, Willie Dafoe and Ian McShane, but the best performance certainly goes to Keanu Reeves, who shines in this film and, for the first time since the Matrix, he feels like a real action star, his characterisation for Wick is terrific, he's flawed, emotional and vengeful, it's a character that we can easily feel for and support. Action packed and a ton of simple fun, I would recommend John Wick to anyone looking for a good action.A hit-man comes out of retirement in order to take down the men who took everything he loves away from him.Best Performance: Keanu Reeves Worst Performance: Omar Barnea",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"

It was great!!! (coming from someone who doesn't like action movies),"OK, first of all I don't like watching action movies, I only suffer through them for my husband. And he does know that I suffer through them, therefore, we don't watch them very often in our household. This movie I not only watched all by myself but enjoyed every minute of it! So why did I start watching it by myself in a first place? One evening I felt like watching myself some eye candy that is Reeves, so sue me. I was prepared, however, to stop it any minute I got tired of it.Also, my first language is Russian; so yes, I get annoyed too when American/British/Australian actors try to pass of as Russian dudes, when I can't understand a single word spoken in awful Russian. But I watched many other movies where a) Russian guys are bad and/or stupid guys and b) speak incomprehensible Russian. Why should this particular movie be singled out? It's not the point!As other reviewers noted, this whole movie is all about fun and pure entertainment. And when I do watch a movie, I want fun and entertainment: not to be depressed, shocked, and saddened out of my wits. Real life can do that sufficiently enough.The first 20 or so minutes were depressing, but they went by fast and served as a backstory. After that...done! Enjoy the ride! I don't think I have ever seen such upbeat action movie where I found myself laughing on numerous occasions. And I agree, there is something Tarantino-esque about this movie but I actually thought that this movie was much better, as it dialed down the gore while keeping surreal atmosphere throughout.In short, this is entertainment people!

John Wick experiences a series of unfortunate tragedies and consequently, he spends the rest of the movie delivering head shots to the men who were responsible. The simplicity of the plot is effective because it gives us plenty of time to focus on the action. And the action is where this movie shines.

Don't they ever learn? Do not kill the dog!,"You have to watch this film knowing that its makers wanted to pay homage to manga, old style samurai movies and directors like John Woo. Everything is... ordered, like something in a Japanese film. There is a code for everything, a way to do things that has to be followed. That is why when the action starts and there are some obvious shortcuts to everything, people don't take them. I am pretty sure somewhere there is a Japanese samurai script or manga that they adapted and the original characters did everything with swords.The choreography is decent, with Keanu doing a combination of Matrix and Equilibrium moves that (finally!) are not all in slow motion. The basic plot is that his character gets angry and starts killing people and then the film ends. If you don't appreciate the style, then the film will be wasted on you.That being said, I have to say that I think the film was not that good. It was not bad, but there were opportunities missed to make it truly unique and memorable. As such, one enjoys the actions scenes then forgets the movie.One of these opportunities was to use the amazing cast they had. Forget that Bridget Moynahan had only a few scenes in some flashbacks and that sexy Adrianne Palicki was completely underexposed, but actors the like of Willem Dafoe and John Leguizamo should have been the bread and butter of the film. Instead, they were relegated to minimal supporting roles.Unexpectedly for the film, but totally expected of the actor, the best action scenes where those involving Daniel Bernhardt, who moved with the same grace and precision that he had when he did all those martial arts films in his youth. He was so good that it just showed he could have kicked Keanu's behind any time he wanted to.Another opportunity was a detailing of Wick's glory days. Instead we are treated with a monologue vaguely explaining how awesome and efficient Wick was when he was a contract killer. Really? He wasn't that way in the film! Keanu played his usual silent brooding self, but at least in one scene, the one where he shouts at Viggo to give him the son, he shows the potential that was lost in writing his character.Bottom line: a rather average action flick, feeling more like a video game than a samurai movie. Instead of minutes and minutes of nameless minions being killed, a strong contouring of the characters, at least of the main ones, would have been a lot more effective. Like many others, I am sure, I was attracted to see the movie by the cast which was, unfortunately, underutilized.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"

"Not bad, but you know what to expect.","Slick, stupid, senseless action entertainment stars Keanu Reeves in the title role. Wick is a former assassin whose wife Helen (Bridget Moynahan, in a thankless role) dies from an unspecified disease. The lonely and distraught Wick receives a final present from her one night: a beagle puppy named Daisy. Soon, Russian creeps led by the infantile Iosef (Alfie Allen) break into his home, steal his car, and beat Daisy to death. Now Wick has nothing left to live for but revenge, and he goes after the Russian mob - his old employers - with a ferocious tenacity.This viewer felt about as bad as he could for Mr. Wick, given that the characters - all of them, really - are thinly written. While it provides some visceral joy watching this force of nature unleash his fury on a non-stop parade of thoroughly expendable action movie villains, there's not that much humanity. The guy wades through henchmen so quickly that he turns into the kind of superhero too often seen in this genre. Fortunately, he does take *some* lumps before this is over, and at one point it looks as if it might be curtains for him.There is a ton of violence, and a ton of digital splatter, although not very much that would be likely to seriously gross out some viewers. The pacing is definitely of a very deliberate variety, until the story - such as it is - begins to take off. While all of this is mildly amusing, ""John Wick"" doesn't really do anything that we haven't seen before in scores of action-revenge sagas.Keanu is once again a figure in minimalist ""acting""; in his one attempt to truly emote, he does his best, but he's still not that convincing. Ian McShane and John Leguizamo are thoroughly wasted in cameo roles; Willem Dafoe gets a little more to do. Swedish star Michael Nyqvist offers some fun as the mob boss. Allen is such a weasel that he can't die soon enough. Adrianne Palicki, like Nyqvist, is entertaining enough as a persistent would be hit woman. Other familiar faces include Lance Reddick, Dean Winters, Daniel Bernhardt, Randall Duk Kim, Clarke Peters, Kevin Nash, and the always welcome (if much too briefly seen) David Patrick Kelly as the leader of a team that cleans up peoples' messes.""John Wick"" is an agreeable enough, but also forgettable, way to kill 102 minutes.Six out of 10.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
"Sensational, Ironic, and Even Touching","I enjoyed the heck out of this. The irony and spareness of the storyline are some its best features. It successfully and succinctly establishes John Wick's character and why we should care without drawing out a melodramatic backstory. The film is quick and to the point much like its protagonist, yet creates a detailed and engrossing underworld of which I found myself wishing to see more. Every character is a bit of a cliché, but that's kind of the point. Stahelski is never self- conscious in the decisions he makes with the film which makes for a robust, yet focused action film.As far as the acting, Keanu Reeves brings the believable and understated rage of a hit-man being forced out of retirement. While no one was going to win an Oscar for their performance, the cast was perfectly suited for the movie. Each actor embodied their role and appeared to truly inhabit the film's surreal and fantastical settings. Whoever cast the movie did a killer job (pun intended).The action sequences are artful to the point of humor, which I think is great. The crisp and imaginative movements of John Wick could belong to a ballet of violence rather than an action film. It's like a less believable yet more impressive Jason Bourne, but I honestly think I'd rather watch John Wick any day.At one point in the film, I had a complaint. I cannot detail too much without spoilers, but let it suffice to say that the pacing was off for a few scenes about three quarters of the way through but quickly pulled itself together before the end.Lastly, I am tempted to respond to negative reviews but I am pretty sure John Wick would look at the couch critics disinterestedly for a few tense moments then turn his back and walk away knowing he was better than them. I do have to say though, for those persons wanting so-called ""realism"" then you should probably stick to documentaries, and even then...",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"

At the start of this movie we don't know who this man John Wick exactly is or what he does or how he can afford such a good house and car, but we do know that he has just lost his wife to some sickness and that she left him as a parting gift a dog so that he could move on with his life.

Needless to say things look good... until Wick happens to stop at a gas station, a Russian s***-head talks some crap (good ol' 'Reek' from Game of Thrones Alfie Allen, who is another good s***-head here), then that night the mobsters come to his house, trash it, beat him up and, worst of all, kill the dog.The writers go for a premise that's fairly easy and borderline lazy; of course we want to see Wick get the payback on these guys - even as they were once his former employers and ironically, in order to really retire, he had to pull a number that set up the Russian mobster's empire in cozy terms - because they killed the pretty-witty-wicky dog! As the Dude would say in Big Lebowski, this aggression will not stand! What ensues from here is a whole lot of violence and carnage, peppered with a whole lot of good character actors and awesome people - Willem Dafoe, Ian McShane, Dean Winters, Adrienne Palikci, Lance Reddick (remember him from The Wire and Oz?) - and that's about it. In that way it's admirable as a kind of meat-n-potatoes flick for the guys (and maybe some girls out there too): watch Keanu Reeves kill a LOT of people.But there are two things that I didn't expect out of what is basically a gigantic action kill-fest that is a time-waster: 1) the fight and stunt choreography, and how the director and cameraman and editor get it all together, works with some tight and efficient work while also being complex at the same time. You can tell where everyone is in relation to one another whether it's Keanu and a dozen guys on a club floor, or just him and Palicki getting dirty (not *that* dirty, the fighting kind) in a hotel room, or three cars in a high speed chase. It's not chaotic but it is intense work and I got more drawn in to it than I expected.The 2) is that there's a whole lot of good background to this world that Wick is in. What I mean is that it almost resembles something out of a comic book (for adults) in a good way: it's like there's this whole set up functionality for someone like Wick to work in, to the point of almost (or simply being) satirical. I had a big laugh at one moment when a cop (just one) comes to Wick's place after he guns down a whole bunch of guys at night, they know each other apparently and he sees a dead guy on the floor behind him, and he just gives him a 'have a good night' and walks away. Then the cleaning crew comes (what do they do when they're *not* cleaning up, or maybe there's always work to be done as far as disposing of bodies in this New York), and then there's the hotel that Wick stays at while he looks for Josef, and it's run like a hotel *for* the criminal element, as if they are always expecting guys with guns to be in their midst and only as that, maybe, they keep it down a little.This is a heightened reality as opposed to something fully realistic, but this added to my pleasure watching the movie. I wanted to see a whole movie set in this world that McShane's character seems to run - like some old film-noir he sits in a jazz club (lit very prettily, this is a colorful movie for big chunks) - and that Reddick is the concierge I suppose. The problem though is that underneath all of this style and potential for a much grander experience it's still a shallow action movie. In a way it may work for this kind of material that it's simply ""you stole my car, you killed my dog, and my wife...""; for an audience coming to this, maybe too much ambiguity would muddy the waters. But I wish the filmmakers, who are clever enough to put in the touches of a much larger environment for these criminals (Dafoe has a good if predictable role also as a hit-man by the way), had gone a little further.As it stands I liked it, though by a certain point - like say in the last twenty minutes - it starts to get into overkill territory. I was still into it for the action and would recommend it simply on those terms. But if you're looking for something challenging as far as engaging/challenging and audience's sympathies, you won't get it. This is all about Reeves punching, kicking, slamming, knifing, blasting, crashing, shooting, choking, and doing everything under the sun, and while he's not Neo here he might as well be.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
Let Sleeping Dogs Lie,"Every so often two movies are released the same calendar year with a similar story—ala Dante's Peak and Volcano, both released in 1997, Deep Impact and Armageddon in 1998, The Illusionist and The Prestige in 2006, Olympus has Fallen and White House Down in 2013 or we can go all the way back to 1984 with Breakin' and Beat Street. I mention this because part way through this movie I couldn't help but realize how eerily similar it is to The Equalizer.The Equalizer, starring Denzel Washington, was about a retired, highly skilled agent that was living alone because he had lost his wife. He was drawn out of retirement by the Russian Mafia because of their iniquities.John Wick, starring Keanu Reeves, is about a retired, highly skilled assassin that lives alone because he lost his wife. He has also been drawn out of retirement by Russians because of their iniquities. That's where the similarities end. Even though John Wick is a good movie I give the nod to The Equalizer over it for a few reasons:1.) Denzel over Keanu. Reeves still has all of the range of a cardboard cutout.2.) The story. Every vengeance/vigilante film requires an impetus for the revenge/vigilantism. Sometimes we, the viewer, don't really care what that reason is, we just want to see some professional butt whipping. Even if that is the case, that's not to say that some causes are not better than others. The cause in John Wick was good just how it came about was very elementary.3.) The head scratching moments. John Wick has three moments that leave you scratching your head with a puzzled look on your face. They are fairly obvious as they are right out of the movie cliché manual. It doesn't cripple the movie but it makes you wonder: in this day and age with a hundred years of movies to refer to, why drum up the same old good guy and bad guy clichés?Those are my only beefs. They aren't enough to ruin the movie well, they might ruin it for some. Once the action kicks into gear it's a real treat. John Wick is masterful with a gun. It's like he took martial arts classes with guns. Instead of giving you a well-placed punch or kick, he uses bullets. And there was something they did well in this movie which I'd never seen in a movie before this one. John Wick had to often, and quite obviously, change magazines in his weapons. John Wick made it very apparent that his guns do not have magazines with unlimited rounds, and that you very well may have to replace a magazine at a very inconvenient time. That was refreshing.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
As personal as it can get!,"John Wick is a well made action movie that does not consist of big explosion and bigger sets. Most of its action pieces rely heavily on close combat and gun. It is stylishly and sleekly done with a tormented Keanu Reeves at the centre of things. The choreographed action sequences are very much close and personal with the brutality of every shot fired and every blow landed resonant in the shots. The directors who were formerly stunt directors have infused variety in the settings in which the action takes place and keep the action flowing. And one thing that really got me interested was how the movie weaves a community of thugs, smugglers, assassins and mob bosses. It seems as if it is altogether a different world with its own set of laws, ethics, codes and loyalties. Since the story is an internal one happening in the underbelly of New York city, this is the only world you get to see and it is intriguing and fascinating, so much like our world and so much unlike ours driven by our desire to survive and thrive. John Wick is the kind of action movie that is rare to find nowadays. If you like some old fashioned vendetta movie and love to see Keanu Reeves kicking some asses, this is the movie for you!",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
Keanu Reeves is back.,"Keanu Reeves is back, HELL YEAH!!John Wick is a movie about, well, John Wick, a normal guy whose wife recently died and her dying gift to him was a dog. Theon the d**k less a**hole from Game of thrones was being his usual d**k self in this movie and decides to kill John wick's dog and steal his sweet ass mustang. Little did he know that John wick wasn't just some normal guy. And we get our revenge action movie. You don't kill someone's dog and steal their ride, you just don't.While many people might find the plot stupid or something, let me tell you, there is a lot more to it than a simple revenge tale. The movie knows what it is and executes it perfectly. But underneath all that revenge, there is some really cool world building going on. There are these rules, managements, neutral zones etc, which push John Wick from being just a simple brainless revenge movie. I hope they make sequels to it as there is A LOT of potential for this become an awesome franchise.Coming back to Keanu Reeves, HOLY S***, he was awesome in this movie. Being a Keanu Reeves fan, it is so great to see him finally get a role where he can shine again. The dude kills it as John Wick. He is cool, he is sleek and he is a total Bada**. Hell, he might give Liam Neeson and Matt Damon a run for their money. :p You appreciate him even more knowing that he did 90% of the stunts in this movie. Because of that, the action scenes consisted of long takes instead of the usual quick cuts we see in Hollywood movies and made the action SO MUCH BETTER. Couple that with good cinematography, slick and sleek directing and pumping soundtrack, and you get yourself an awesome RARE action movie.Another thing this movie did well was that even though John Wick is shown to be one of the best or THE BEST in his work, he is not invincible or immortal, at the end, he is a human. Many similar movies forget this point and make their heroes way TOO good that it takes you out of the experience.I really really hope this movie does well enough on the box office that we get a sequel from the same team. Highly recommended if you are looking for an action movie or are a Keanu Reeves fan.8.5/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
Please see this movie.,"John Wick is an interesting film that came and went before our eyes. Yet those who did decide to give it a chance, seem to love it very much. It's 'Certified Fresh' on Rottentomatoes and has a 7.5 rating on IMDb as of right now. Impressive for a film that is basically one shoot out after the next....after the next....after the next.An ex hit-man comes out of retirement after he's attacked by three thugs in his home. This attack leaves him beaten, without a car and a dead dog, which was given to him by his recently deceased wife. Big mistake. Once these guys tries to sell the muscle car to a garage that strips parts, the owner seems to instantly recognize it. The man asks, who's car this is. Who cares? The young spoiled brat replies. I can tell you one thing, we beat his ass to get it, and his stupid dog too. Bam, punched in the face. The kid goes crying to his mob boss of a father, who then calls up that mechanic. Did you punch my son in the face? Yes sir, I did. Why, he asked. Well sir, because he stole John Wick's car...and killed his dog.Oh crap.This sets up the film, the classic revenge tale. Nothing really new here. We've seen dozens of films where the retired killer has to come out of retirement to revenge the death of a loved one. This time it happens to be a canine. The dog is adorably cute and my wife was in tears...TEARS I TELL YOU, when they killed the poor pup. About one scene before it happened, she says to me, ""Are they going to kill the dog?"" Terrified of the answer that I would not give her. Well, yes, they did. She instantly wanted John Wick to kill EVERYONE. So I guess when a dog gets it, you instantly want those responsible dead. Funny, I feel the same way. When people die on film, no big deal, but when an animal dies, all hell breaks lose.After that is out of the way, John Wick suits up to take out those who have wronged him. It just happens to be the son of his former boss. So when the boss finds out, he knows he's in trouble. So now he has to get to Wick before Wick gets to them. Thus, the body count piles up. It piles up in a finely tuned operatic fashion, as the action sequences are some of the best in the last few years. Wick uses his guns with precision. Shot to the chest, then to the head. It's robotic. One man against a dozen? Fair fight.To say the action in John Wick is stylized in an understatement. This is one of the best action films in years. Chad Stahelski, a stunt coordinator, makes his directing debut here. So he knows his way around a fight, being responsible for such films as the Expendables, The Wolverine, Tron: Legacy, and many many more. I like this new trend of giving people from different departments a chance at the directing chair. See what they can bring to the table. The man clearly knows his stuff, so give him a script to shoot and see what he can achieve. He nails it here. One impressive sequence has Wick going into a club, with multiple levels and rooms and takes out the bad guys one by one. First silently, then when all hell breaks lose, with calm and ease. Bottom line: This is one FUN film.Reeves never impresses with his acting ability. It's kind of a running gag with people that he cannot act his way out of a paper bag. One scene here has him actually showing some emotion, which is when he reads the letter from his wife after receiving the dog. The rest of the film is how bad ass can Reeves look while taking out dozens of people. The answer, really bad ass. Familiar faces show up, such as Willem Dafoe, as another assassin. Adrianne Palicki as a beautiful....well...assassin. Michael Nyqvist, from the original Girl With the Dragon Tattoo series, plays the Russian Mobster, whose son, Alfie Allen aka Theon Greyjoy, gets him into this mess. As if we needed another reason to hate Theon. Finally Ian McShane as a friendly face in a crowd of so few.The world created in John Wick is interesting to me. These assassins have gold coins that get them into these places that only the secret society of assassins can access. There are hidden clubs, hotel rooms, etc. How can all these assassins and hit-men be in a club and not want to shoot each other. Well, there seem to be certain rules. Don't break them, or there might be consequences.Those club scenes are really fun. Jonathan Sela, the DOP, bathes the film is icy blues and nice neon lighting for those club scenes. Giving it a heightened look and feel. Everything about the film feels smooth as ice, just like John Wick. The directing style reflects the lead character. Aggressive when it needs to be, but calm and collected most of the time. When I say aggressive, boy do I mean aggressive. Wick acts like a man with nothing to lose, no fear. He will walk right into the lions den to get the job done.John Wick is one of the biggest surprises of 2014 for me. While some might call it a no brainer repetitive action film I call it high class action fun. FUN is the key word here. Watching John Wick dispose of those bodies was fun. Seeing this society of people who all know each other was fun. Seeing Keanu Reeves back in the limelight doing what he does best? You called it...fun.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
John Wick busy equalizing,"A grieving hit man after a series of unfortunate events goes about exacting revenge on his former boss' son.Since Rocky 4 the stereotype Russian bad guy films seemed to ease off, however, mirroring the politics of today there appears to be an increasing influx of bad guy Russians, Equalizer, Taken 3, Jack Ryan, Die Hard 5 to name just a few. Amongst the abundance of them comes John Wick with its on location feel and slick action sequences.Wonderfully directed by Chad Stahelski & David Leitch's with great action scenes and Derek Kolstad's solid dialogue Wick goes from one scene to the next exacting revenge on those who have wronged him. Its a fine straightforward affair without the quirkiness or humour of the likes director Guy Ritchie or Paul McGuigan. Stahelski delivers a straight up action thriller with hard hitting violence, blood baths through a hotel, church, cars and blood spattered clubs. Unashamedly from the shootouts to knife fights it oozes cool, complemented by the lighting, sound design, music tracks and score from Tyler Bates.The cast are unprecedentedly on form with Michael Nyqvist, Alfie Allen, Adrianne Palicki and memorable Willem Dafoe. Bridget Moynahan and Ian McShane cameo with John Leguizamo small part effortlessly stealing the cameo show. Keane Reeves is perfectly cast with his minimal dialogue and screen presence.Even with its dark tone it's more fun than the comparable excellent Equalizer. Yes, like all actions there's an obligatory Jason Statham/Van Damme-like showdown/fight off and John Wick is unavoidably reminiscent of Get Carter and Payback but as a revenge action it is as completely rounded as they come - recommended.",,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"

I'm not exactly sure what the record is for most kills in a movie, however, would be that this would give it a run for the money. Every kill was done with such precision you find yourself excited about the next one. Its certainly nice to see Keanu back on the screen. Although not as good as Speed or Point Break, he gives a fantastic performance. Move aside Stephen Segal and Jean Claude! Fun movie to see on the big screen.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
Do not ever mess with other man's automobile. And his dog!,"Gritty, stylish and fast paced action film with very overused revenge/back from retirement plot. But you don't even notice the paper thin plot because of the strong characters and well directed action scenes. There were not a single dull moment in this hour and half long film. It was very good that writer/director didn't waste much time on the John Wick character's back story. We got to see the glimpse of his life and that was all the viewer needed. The mystery behind John Wick only grows when we see the first reactions of some other characters, when they learn that he has been attacked. It wasn't only John Wick's character that actually evolved without much development. Every talking scene we learned to know the players more and more, but just enough to keep them mysterious and keep us still interested. It's something that is missing in most of the newer action films. Real powerful acting work. It was real pleasure to see Keanu back at his top form. And kudos to the screenwriter who managed to write Russian dialog that actually sounded little bit like Russian, not just some pointless gibberish. And of course the actors, who managed to speak it understandably.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
Woof!,"Keanu Reeves is the John Wick of the title, a grieving one man army who gets tipped over the edge when gangsters kill his dog. Carnage ensues.The paying public do like a good revenge flick, there have been plenty this last couple of decades, and they do go down well. Once the set-up has been staged - Wick grieves at the loss of his loved one - gets some small joy via a pet - only to have that snatched away from him, then the film becomes a joyously unstoppable actioner.Wick, in good hands with a moody and beefy Reeves (face fuzz strange, though) strong in presence, cuts a swathe through the gangland eastern blockers. And that's pretty much it! Characterisations are thin on the ground, it's a bit nutty and of course preposterous, but boy is it fun. There you go, a box office winning actioner without pretensions.

"Not the best action movie of the year, but it'st sly, swift and stylish","This is a sly, swift and stylish action movie that is actually a decent popcorn flick. Sure the plot isn't anything grand, but that isn't the core of this movie. A movie such as this needs a spark and how to go about it from there on. It isn't as adrenaline filled entertainment like ""The Raid"" or has a super well blended and enticing story mixed with action like ""The Raid 2"" but it'st still a pretty cool movie. And seeing Keanu Reeves kicking ass and taking names is just the bonus. Like I said the plot doesn't have anything that really stands out, but the stylish cinematography, choreography with enough cool action elements make this one worth at least one watch. Especially if you like action movies. However I could see why some audiences would not like this movie and why some people just wouldn't.

This thing's got bite. Nice change of pace.,"Keanu Reeves isn't the guy that seems suited for your usual revenge flick, but he works fairy well for ""John Wick"". There's an inherent detachment to Reeves for a good portion of the film, but he's also got that quiet brooding that roils beneath the surface.Probably the best thing about this movie are the action scenes, which aren't cut to shreds. They're well-staged and have a nice fluid brutality to them. Simple but effective.What was also really nice was the clearly defined (under)world with its coded language, currency ad protocols. It harked back to ""Payback"" and the mob-as-corporate-culture. Also, Wick had modern dress and domestic appointments (probably due to his departed wife), but he's using an old touchtone phone and getting around in circa '79s cars. Little touches that add character.It's great news that they're planning a sequel. They've already built the world, and I'm in for more.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
Disgusting,"So disgusting is this piece of filth that after one hour of perpetual killings, many of them graphic and sadistic, I simply had to leave the room and get some fresh air. I then immediately destroyed the DVD as a public service.The makers of this material should be arrested and imprisoned for corrupting society. And anyone who actually enjoys watching this ordure should immediately seek mental health advice. What plot there is can only be described as infantile and absurd. The film is simply a vehicle for promoting video games where the player searches out black hooded figures to exterminate them.We are expected to believe that a trained hit-man is woken at night by his puppy only to be hijacked by three (naturally) Russian mafia gangsters who beat him up, steal his treasured car and kill his dog.This same man then kills literally hundreds of security guards and other hit men who come at him one by one in a morbid procession of death. Night club revelers carry on regardless as security men are gunned down in their midst. Other security guards have their throats cut whilst seemingly standing there helplessly waiting for death.The concept that all these security men all have partners, mothers and families does not deter the hero. We are encouraged to think that any scale of revenge is permissible under all circumstances and to all proportions even though most of these murdered guards didn't actually do anything against him.The only merit of this film is that it represents perfectly the mentality of American culture; namely that if a cell of terrorists kill a few thousand Americans we are entitled to launch decades or war thereafter, bring tens of millions of innocent Muslim civilians into endless suffering and destroy the entire culture of the Middle East.

'Death Wish' meets 'Point Blank' !,"In today's day it is as hard to make a good action movie as it is to break box office records. Thrillers may be based on tried and tested formulate, but that is the reason why to bring something new and refreshing becomes harder and harder in this genre. 'John Wick' is a tale of revenge, a man with a violent past who is brought back to the life he left behind when he is brutally attacked and his dog is killed. The plot works because it doesn't try anything new, in fact it takes you back several decades to Lee Marvin in 'Point Blank'. Keanu Reeves's character of 'John Wick' is a throwback to Lee Marvin, Charles Bronson and every other bad ass who doesn't bother to say much but shoots instead. This in itself is refreshing, just a simple action thriller with no over-complicated storyline and ingenious twist. This movie is quite different to the other great tale of revenge released at the same time; 'The Equalizer', mainly because Keanu Reeves is a much different actor to Denzel Washington.

Highly entertaining for the majority of the runtime thanks to the heart pounding music, breath taking stunts and Keanu Reeves himself.

There were stirring hand to hand combat scenes and verbal responses to the death scenes as I sat in my chair feeling the adrenaline throbbing in my insides. As for the performances, the acting was satisfying enough for an action flick, except for Willem Dafoe he was excellent, but c'mon he's always excellent.The action sequences were handled very nicely every shot was sharp and precise unlike recent action films that use shaky cam techniques, where you can't even identify whose fighting who. Which makes this a very refreshing action film, and highly satisfying for any one who wants Neo back on the big screen.

Uneven and long but plenty of good ingredients,"John Wick might be the most uneven film I've seen in 2014. The premise is good and the film well-constructed but the pacing is poor. It takes far too long for the action to kick in. The first hour is all setup, with characters repeatedly telling each other (and the audience) that John Wick is really tough. However, it takes forever for us to actually see this, with only one good action sequence in the first hour. When the action finally kicks in, its pretty glorious, but it overstays its welcome in the final act. With one dramatic fight scene after another, towards the end John Wick feels too much like a video game, with the protagonist simply proceeding through enemies like levels.Keanu Reeves reminds us in the overlong opening act why producers and directors don't hire him for his acting talents. Fortunately, once the first hour has dragged on, he reminds us why we do hire him - he's a complete badass who at 50 plus years old is absolutely still in his prime. Dean Winters and Alfie Allen are excellent casting additions, though not exactly for acting talent, but for the presence they bring to the film.Overall, John Wick is a nice time-killer and most promisingly, constructs a world I would love to revisit (in a better paced sequel).",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"

There isn't, without a doubt, anyone in Hollywood more capable to portray John Wick character better than Keanu Reeves. He is John Wick. He was born for the role. The supporting veteran actors were also well known to the public and fulfil this piece of cinema with quality and realism, making the plot even more plausible and believable to the craving audience.Overall, this is not the typical action-revenge/ professional assassin movie, full of incredible stunts, drugs, secret mob societies, and revenge. This film is much more than this. This work of cinema has deepness and a lot of layers on it, with a lot of subjects treated.A movie with such quality that I will rewatch it over and over again.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
The equalizer starring Keanu Reeves,"Having watched ""The equalizer"" just over a few weeks ago, I couldn't help analyzing the similarities both these films share together. While both films serve well the purpose to kill time when you have got nothing special in mind, needless to say both movies are easily forgettable. Neither of the movies offer griping story, stunning performance or brutal action. In my opinion ""John Wick"" is slightly more entertaining. For one, Keanu's character is somewhat more developed and believable as a hit-man returned from retirement. Two, there is also a parallel storytelling of underworld structure and code. And three, John Wick has got style. However, if you are in a mood to see bloody violence, go watch The raid 2.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
"A simply told, brilliantly made, action movie milestone.","Fun, just fun. Not your typical action movie. Not messy like a lot of them are typically now. The fighting and gunplay is very smooth, yet also highly graphics and violent. The story, about a retired hitman seeking revenge over the death of his dog, is simple, but since Jon Wick is portrayed as a tragic, sympathetic character, its good enough. Reeves also turns in a surprisingly good performance. If nothing else, this movie deserves respect for its attention to detail. These filmmakers really know what they are doing, they craft and layer this thing with a passion that makes it highly pleasurable to view, right down to the subtitled conversations, being very in sync with whoever is speaking, to a degree that makes reading them faster. That's what this movie is, fast, quick, constant action, with a simple effective story and great performances, also with a passion and professionalism that makes it stand out from the rest. It has earned its spot as a milestone for the genre, based on that alone.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
Eva Longoria presents...a popcorn movie with Keanu Reeves!,"The first 10 minutes of the movie are somehow misleading. You may think that you're watching a dark drama driven by revenge.Fortunately (more than unfortunately I guess) this is not the case. It is a pop movie made to please the audience in a tongue-in-chick manner. You enter the world of mobsters and payed assassins where everyone is known, everyone goes to the same place for entertainment, follows rules and is slick and understanding! Like ...Cheers, where everybody knows your name! So this isn't a movie to be taken seriously. It's just for fun. And after numerous killings, lame martial arts moves and macho one liners... you get exactly that.All the clichés you know well from thousands other movies are here too. The villain (so to speak because everyone is a villain) instead of killing his captured victim right away and solve all of his problems in an instant, starts blubbering philosophical BS and chooses an unconventional way to kill him (instead of let's say a bullet in the head).So is that kind of the movie.Is it entertaining? Well yes. I think so. I wasn't bored for the most part. I learn quickly to ignore the plot holes and just tried to enjoy it.Overall: It's a popcorn movie, so go get your popcorn! P.S. Fun fact: Eva Longoria is one of the producers!",,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
Excellent movie....of a certain type,"I have mixed feelings about this movie.On the plus side, it was perfectly cast. The reptilian Keanu Reeves as the reptilian John Wick is spot on! The other main characters are also quite believable in their respective roles. 10/10 for characterization.On the negative side, the action sequences (basically the whole movie) was extremely well choreographed and fun to watch. However, the way Wick kills literally dozens of attackers without being seriously injured himself strains credulity and really bugs me. 4/10 for believability.However, I allow that this movie was not meant to be taken too seriously but to be enjoyed at face value, so I will average the two and give it a 7.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"

An entertaining action film,John Wick is the kind of action movies which will remind the action films fans of the movies in late 80s and early 90s. The action scenes were paced well and entertaining. Also this movie must have definitely given relief to Keanu Reeves as he delivered a hit after long time especially after the disastrous 47 Ronin. I felt that Michael Nyqvist as the main antagonist was cool and at the same time menacing along with other secondary villains. Another best part of the movie was that this film was not dragged like other action films in recent times.I am definitely waiting for the sequel which is releasing in 2017 and would hope it would develop into a better franchise.John Wick is one such movie that should be seen without any logic and would prove to be entertaining on any weekend.,7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"

Dinner Reservation for,"This is a film that you just sit back with a bowl of popcorn and devour. It has a simple plot that moves quickly to set up the action scenes. The writing is well done and allows the viewer to follow the story while being invested in the characters. It could have been just another mindless action flick, but the actors and the dialogue give it some depth to make it a film worth watching more than once.John Wick (Keanu Reeves), a retired legend in the assassin world, mourns for his dead wife. Her last gift to him is a puppy and a note telling him to love and find peace. It doesn't take long for Iosef Tarasov (Alfie Allen) to mess up John's path to these things. In response, Wick delves back into the criminal world he left behind to seek retribution for Iosef's actions.The story weaves Wick's past life into his present life and reconnects him with old faces including: the female assassin Ms. Perkins (Adrianne Palicki), friend (Willem Dafoe), and former employer Viggo Tarasov (Michael Nyqvist). He faces the difficult task of breaking Viggo's organization to get to the man who took his mourning period away from him, Viggo's son.Put this on, sit back, and expect a film that delivers for the expectations of: action, a simple but tight story, and an enjoyable time.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
Incredible total non-plot and how the heck rated 7.4?,"I saw John Wick for the first time last night. I was amazed - I mean - what the absolute? After the set up, it was basically one violent murder session. The 'set up' was the most perfunctory excuse for what followed possible. Laughable doesn't begin to describe it. If this is what scriptwriting has become then I'm getting into it. It is just incredible. And what follows completely avoids any kind of human description - they aren't people at all. Just automatons with no discernable personalities heading towards violent oblivion or an ostensible human dishing out said violent oblivion. And I like cheesy action films. Amazing. I sent this to a friend and he thought I was being postive. Which I suppose makes sense because what I describe is, I suppose, the film's strength in some people's eyes.

More plotholes than bullets fired in this movie,"First off, the setting is cool, the main idea sounds great and choosing Keanu Reeves for the main role was a perfect match.BUT... I can only agree with the 1/10* review of 'shudmeilas13' from November 2014 titled 'This movie is a bad joke'. PLUS there's unfortunately many more plotholes than he mentions.
Every negative point he lists is very true, besides his first one with the russian accent, I didn't really care about that one. There was barely a scene where I did not shake my head and shrug, because the writing was just SO illogical.I can take a movie where's a lot of shooting and action, I love that.

"Short, sharp, artful violence, hyper-stylist revenge. Sleek but impactful. A must watch for action lovers, so to thrill.","""Now you're truly getting on my wick. JOHN Wick.""The boldest and ballsiest shoot them up film discharged in years. With a straightforward reason, an implicit mythology thus numerous severe head-shot kills that you need to ponder whether John Wick's whole preparing has been spent mastering Call Of Duty, this film conveys more than only 101 minutes of extraordinary activity, it gives the makings of a welcome, crisp establishment.Numerous will view it as something of an arrival to shape for Keanu Reeves and it is reasonable to consider it such, however simply because - critically - he isn't obliged to really act that far out of his customary range of familiarity. As a previous hit-man lamenting his wife's passing, Wick is a man who is sincerely cut off. And after that, when Russian hooligans break into his home to take his sweet ride, thrashing him in the process and slaughtering the puppy that his wife purchased for him from past the grave, Wick returns back to his old methods for being a stone-cool executioner. In any case, we win on the grounds that Reeves is obliged to do small emoting other than the odd cry at an opportune time.Indeed, it's telling that the couple of minutes where eyebrows get raised are the point at which the film is by all accounts considering itself excessively important, and these generally happen when Wick gets truly irate and Reeves winds up wrath snarling like Bale's Batman attempting to make himself really inhale fire.More to the point however, executives Chad Stahelski and David Leitch (the last setting off uncredited because of a DGA question) know how to arrange marvelous activity set-pieces, which joyfully make up around 80% of the film. With over 20 years of motion picture trick work under each of their profession belts, Stahelski and Leitch plainly know how to make the best of their projectile ridden beats, conveying smooth, quick paced scenes of all around made executioner confusion.The majority of this makes for a consummately serviceable requital thriller, a Death Wish return to a type that feels decades old in any case, just to go that additional mile, John Wick is raised to date with a key component required for any film to be effective in this day and age: it feels like a comic-book adjustment.As the film advances, it is set up that, not just does John Wick have a close super-powered level of capability in terms of executing individuals, however there is a whole system of hit men and hitwomen, who keep a set up code of honor, arrangement in a unique money and even have their own place of refuge – an inn oversaw by the unshakable Lance Reddick who caters for his visitors' requirements with balance and self-control. It's not until you achieve past the film's midpoint that you understand this is yet another motion picture that has made its own universe to investigate, an increased reality with heaps of potential for future spin-offs.All of which may make you feign exacerbation. All things considered, who needs another establishment with another 'verse to be wrung dry? It's difficult to gripe however when John Wick is such a smaller, punchy film without an ounce of fat on it. In this first motion picture of a mooted set of three, there's no space for over saturation of the idea, or for cushioning out with hybrid references and referrals. It's only a short, sharp, projectile driven bulldozer of a motion picture that snaps necks and smothers brains. What's more, if that isn't sufficient for you, go re-watch The Lake House or something",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"

Big Fan of John Wick,"I am a big fan of Keanu Reeves, have been for three decades. I don't care about critics of his acting ability or style. His style is unique and that's what separates him from other actors. Over the years he has been put in a certain mold, the mold of the quiet weird guy. Neo or Klaatu from The Day the Earth Stood Still, that type. Think of Tom Ludlow from Street Kings. That would be as close to John Wick as you can get as far as comparisons. But John Wick is much more bad-ass. He is a retired hit-man who has found love for the first time. The description on IMDb describes what happens so this stuff is not a spoiler. He loses his wife and you can tell that it was devastating. After her funeral he receives a pet carrier at his door and signs for it. It is a puppy. Cute as hell! It is a gift from his wife, a last gift in order for him to grieve with someone and not alone. You can tell he falls in love with the dog. Between that and the fact that it was a gift from his dead wife, it makes the dog that much more important. When a mob bosses son, (Alfie Allen), and his crew decide they want Wicks 69' Mustang, sweet car indeed, they break in and catch him off guard. He is retired. They beat him senseless and then kill the dog. Bad move. They should have killed Wick, but they don't know who is. But his father does. Viggo, the Russian mob boss and former employer of John Wick. He then has to explain to his disappointment of a son that he just killed the dog of the man that is not the boogeyman, but he is the guy you call to kill the boogeyman. From there things go from bad to worse for all involved. A lot of death. A lot of blood, gunfire, hand to hand fighting. Car chases, explosions and slimy hit-men and women out for a bounty. There is also a hotel that is specifically designed for the shady world that John Wick and other hit-men live in. Pretty cool. Keanu is at his best in this movie, not just physically, but emotionally. Yes, his character is quiet just like you would expect from Keanu. But once he gets going, he is one scary dude. Cold as ice. Great acting by all involved and great story. Just a wonderful movie all around. I don't care how many movies they make in this genre, as long as they all stand up to John Wick.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
Slick Action,"John Wick is a sleek, highly stylized action film that functions as a vehicle for Keanu Reeves to reestablish himself as one of the coolest action movie actors some fifteen years after he first took the mantle with The Matrix.Parts of John Wick certainly require significantly above average suspension of disbelief, but overall it is a highly enjoyable, if somewhat mindless, time at the movies.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
"Fun, Action Packed and violent","John Wick with a basic look at action movies looks like a regular action movie but when you watch it you can tell that it's more than your basic action movie it has moments where it's character driven and you really get a sense on why the chracters act the way that they do and we really see this emphasised with John as we feel his pain and we understand his character and we know and care about him and we can devote time and effort into caring about him
Keanu Reeves is the perfect cating choice for this movie he can kick so much ass and i have to say that i can't think of anyone to play this role he just does so much and puts in effort and care for thre character and i love how he can go from someone who seems soft especially all the stuff with the characters wife and then become the scary hitman who could kill you in 5 seconds and that is quite some acting and i could honestly talk about great Keanu Reeves is in this role for so long that he goes for me from being a actor who i thought was good to being one that i want to see more movies with him in them.
also in the cast is Michael Nyqvist,Alfie Allen,Willem Dafoe,Adrianne Palicki,Dean Winters,Daniel Bernhardt,Toby Leonard Moore,Bridget Moynahan and Lance Reddick while the supporting cast was good they really are over shadowed to Keanu Reeves and they are good i just don't think they were the most dynamic cast and had a rushed time on screen but really they could have been used a little more.
John wick for me was good there was some pacing issues for me in some of the parts where i thought they were trying to pan the run time but that's really what i thought and i really liked this the final act was one of my favorite final acts in a action movie from recent years and the action scences involving the gunplay was great and the hand to hand combat was also very well done they have done it in such a way where i can really belive that the action was real and overall the movie delivered on the action violence and the drama all in one and i thought that overall John Wick was very enjoyable and defiently a action must watch.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
Disappointing!,"John Wick disappointed on several levels. I probably had too high expectations, but the ""one-man-army/revenge"" concept has been done so many times before and done much better than this. The movie is rather boring - no real story here, and the characters aren't very interesting. The action scenes are mediocre and too much ""over the top"". The whole thing just gets really tedious after a while.The revenge concept needs to generate sympathy from the viewer, and we need to be interested in seeing the revenge getting carried out. This movie didn't manage to do any of that for me. I was surprised to read quite a bit of positive reviews of John Wick, and a metascore of 68 was also surprising. I'm normally in line with at least the IMDb score, but this time I can't find much in this movie that warrants more than a 4.0 rating.",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
Zero stars.,"Willem Dafoe is bad at aiming: So my guess is that this is some old stunt-friend of Keanu's who now directs his first full length feature and Keanu has simply agreed to help out. Because the directing is silly, the script is bad, the dialogue is laughable at best, the plot is weak, Keanu is as ""whoa"" as always, the other actors are ludicrous, the characters are not believable, the hardrock guitars in every fight is cliché, and for me as a swede it is fun to see Mikael Nyquist in a film, but my guess is that he only got cast because his English pronunciation is so cheesy. If you want to see an awesome movie without a plot, solely based on constant fighting and violence that feels, go watch The Raid instead. This is quite possibly the worst film I have ever seen, and the first time I give anything zero stars. Not even a soundtrack featuring Marilyn Mansons weakest song to date saves this.",,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
"Bloody, Brutal and Beautiful, It's Ninety Minutes' Worth of Style Without Substance","Keanu Reeves plays the Liam Neeson role in this slick, sharp, vicious little bout of revenge fantasy. With support work from a whole mess of ""I know that guys"" and a blow-away effects budget, it's a real riot to watch, not to mention one hell of a tech demo for the masterminds behind the fight scenes. Like those Neeson kill-em-alls, though, it's as straight as an arrow and shallower than the kiddie pool. In some ways, it's refreshing to just dispense with all the stereotypical origin trappings and get right into the firefights, but at the end of the show it just feels like one long, easy excuse to watch a whole mess of cool stuff without any extra justification. Lust-worthy cars, ferocious weaponry, powerful western-styled physicality, stereo-thumping tunes, magnificent cityscapes, the list just goes on and on. Escapists delight, for John Wick has come to deliver a dream. Cinephiles, well just sit back and try to let the sheer, celebratory brutality beat your conscience into submission. It won't be too difficult.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
Some people hate just to hate,I honestly read some of these bad views thinking some people were on lots of drugs when they wrote them because this is one of the best actions in a long time. I actually made an account just to tell everyone not to listen to the bad reviews for a second. If you like Beast mode dude kills all the bad guys action movies then you will love this movie! I give it a 10 out of 10 because for what it is....... It's damn near flawless. Very violent and brutal action scenes and Keanu is an absolute beast in this. I read one review saying this was a comedy and just to clarify that there is almost zero humor in the movie. Keanu is calm and just professional as can be almost the whole movie. Minus the accent he almost reminded me of Jean Reno in the professional. Overall if your a fan of action watch this movie with confidence and some of the people on here shouldn't watch a movie from a genre they don't like and then talk about how bad the movie was. Obviously if you hate scifi or fantasy movies and you go see lord of the rings your not gonna like it but to anyone with an open mind even slightly loves it.

John Wick – short fuse.,"John Wick is a former mob assassin who comes out of retirement to seek vengeance against the criminals who kill his dog and steal his car.Just before John Wick's (Keanu Reeves) wife dies from an unspecified illness, she arranges for a Beagle puppy named Daisy to be delivered to him after her death to help him cope with his grieving. A few days later he goes for a ride in his vintage muscle car. At a gas station, three shady men approach him and offer to buy his car. Wick refuses but the three follow him home, brutally attack him, kill his dog and steal the car. Losing Daisy, the only living link to his wife, lights John Wick's wick. The former assassin takes matters into his own hands.Using his former skills, Wick learns that the three men are Russian mobsters, one of whom is the son of mob boss, Viggo Tarasov (Michael Nyqvist). He is also Wick's former employer. When Tarasov learns what his spoilt son (Alfie Allen) has done, he attempts to extend Wick an olive branch. Wick, however, is already on the warpath and out for blood.Keanu Reeves' performance is badass, full of energy and even demonstrates some emotional range, a welcome change from his usual wooden performances. He continues his career-long habit and does most of his own stunt work. Michael Nyqvist, best known for the original Girl with the Dragon Tattoo films, is intimidating and over the top as the mob boss. Game of Thrones' Alfie Allen is despicable as the mob boss's son, and like his character in the TV series, you'll love to hate him. However, his Russian accent is almost laughable.One of the film's best aspects is its creation of a whole new criminal underworld. A 'clean up' service for body disposal is accessible to hit men and there's an establishment called the Continental Hotel, a safe haven where professionals are forbidden to carry out 'jobs' on the premises. The professionalism and efficiency of the mob network adds more layers to both the story and main character. Wick's wit and proficiency, are clearly a product of a sophisticated culture of rampant crime. This also gives the film potential for a sequel.John Wick is a simple revenge story, with fast-paced action and hand-to-hand gunfights some critics are calling, 'gun fu'. The film is consistent with the gritty reality of other action films such as Taken and The Bourne series. For all who enjoy a good action flick with lots of guns, explosions and high voltage fight scenes, this is the movie for you.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
GREAT INTRO-BUILD BUT A SHAKY PICTURE.,"The movie came in with perfect intentions for John Wick to do the needed damage. I was very excited for his reign but this ""boogeyman killer"", ""Shadow-man"" looked a little rusty. Maybe because of his retirement?
I did root for John Wick all the way through but when the bad guys clearly have more than one chance to easily kill him and they DON'T but instead decide to throw him around it makes me feel a little awkward.
Some shallow choreography in the shoot outs. It seems John Wick is the only one that can shoot straight, EXCEPT, that is, when he has his first clear shot at his main target. Haha!
Also seems he's the only hitman who can see his opponents first- more especially when he's walking from room to room & wall to wall shooting them like targets.
Also the arbitrary ""rules"" of a ""code"" between all the community of hitmen/women was up in the air and disconnected from any of the stories momentum.
In an action movie all these details make a huge difference on the pay off.
All this production needs is a good script and better choreography.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
Amazing Action,"John Wick: a movie that I watched this past Friday, and as I said, it's the better equalizer. Keanu reeves really kills it in his role as John wick, and it is actually perfect how his character is made. He is like the headshot king, but because of retirement he is just rusty enough where he has a chance of dying. Like superman vs ironman, still effective, but can die with enough force. The lead up to his character is amazing, and the mobsters describing him make John wick sound like Dirty Harry and Jason Bourne in one. An amazing movie, quick yet badass kills, and I'm not saying any to spoil the movie, but just general amazement throughout. I'm just sad that this film will probably get forgotten.

"Revenge gets wicked, bad-ass and returns in top form","Revenge driven films have always been a top notch example of action and/or horror films, consisting of a storyline where a main character undergoes a dramatic, traumatic and yet sometimes violent ordeal against a person or a group of attackers that leave the victim left for dead and loss of a loved one, only to have survived and is now driven for justice and set on taking down the attackers with vengeance. John Wick is one of those films and not only has that formula but it does give it a fresh take with a well-written script, polished performances and well staged action sequences.Directed by stunt coordinator Chad Stahelski (alongside David Leitch) in their first directed feature film, they both know how to handle an action flick in terms of direction, pace, realism and quality. They indeed use the best out of the well written script from Derek Kolstad, who ensures that not only is the action present and moving the story along but the character development and pace are taken seriously for the audience to follow and connect. Story goes that John Wick (played by Keanu Reeves, who is indeed back in top form not since Constantine) is a retired hit-man who is grief of his recently deceased wife and is coping with the gift of a dog from her to help John with the pain and loneliness. Whist out for a drive in his 69' Mustang, he comes across Losef (played by Alfie Allen from TV's Game of Thrones) and his mates who offer to buy his precious ride but John declines and sets off his way. But soon after, Losef and co invade his home and brutally beat him, kill his dog and steal his ride. Having survived, John sets out on vengeance on Losef, but when he discovers his background history to his past employer (Michael Nyqvist in bad guy form again), the war between two sides erupts into revenge that only one will live.The action sequences as mentioned are in top polished presentation, consisting of fast kinetic fist fights and shootouts. The use of practical stunt work is in favor rather than use CGI for the impossible and the results from its director are clear from experience. One of the best sequences of the film is the club house, where John attempts to kill Losef and his protectors by single handily taking them on one-by-one. The character of John in particular is ruthless and deadly throughout the film and Reeves pulls this off with ease, it looks like a mix of the latest James Bond (Daniel Craig), a dash of Jason Bourne from the Bourne films and Bryan Mills from Taken all rolled into the one character. But there is emotion with him, as you see in the first half hour of his fall from peace and again it lacks with most revenge driven films.The villain is the opposite but the cunningness, determination and will to stop John is indeed there, and the magic of Nyqvist brings this to the screen (he was the main villain in Mission Impossible 4, but he is much used better in this film). The supporting cast includes the talents of William Dafoe, Ian McShane, John Leguizamo, Adrianne Palicki and Dean Winters to name a few and they all do give the film justice.John Wick is a surprising return to the 'Revenge' genre and it has indeed suppressed what The Expendables 3 should have been (not to say that it bad) but in terms of story, action, character and presentation it's indeed worth the ticket price to see it and I highly recommend it for action fans of Taken, Faster and Dead Man Down.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
John Wick Review,"If it's one thing action movies can teach us, it's that you don't mess with people who have nothing left to lose. John Wick hinges on the simple premise of a retired hit-man who plows through the Russian mafia and leaves a mile-long body trail, all because they killed his puppy. And stole his ride. Somebody has to pay! As silly this may sound, the film plays it all with a straight face, and it works because there is a good amount of heart to the setup. In the opening scenes, we see that this is more than the story of a man, his car, and his dog; it's the story of a loss and betrayal. Once the appropriate pathos is established, John Wick rises as the tough and skilled action hero we can root for. It doesn't take long for the butt-kicking to commence, but once it does, it's densely-packed, fast-paced, relentlessly-brutal, and very well-executed. Whether shooting, punching, stabbing, or running bad guys over, it is quite a rush to watch Wick descend into the criminal underworld and find payback.As exciting and stylish as the film is, what really keeps it from falling into mediocrity is the title character. The film successfully evokes sympathy for Wick - the man who lost his wife, before losing everything else - and it provides a solid reasoning for why we should care about whether or not Wick succeeds. As the film goes on, Wick's journey takes him through a bizarre criminal world with its own set of rules, codes, and even currency. It turns out that it's a world Wick is already familiar with, and he has a history with most of the minor characters that pop up. Thus, the film unearths stark themes of how the past, present, and future are entwined.This film is well-shot, with great-looking photography and editing. It is especially refreshing that the action scenes are solid and steady, with no fast-cutting or camera shake. I also think the color schemes and nighttime cityscapes lend the film a dark and grimy type of neo-noir appeal. Acting is fine for what it is; you may not think much of Keanu Reeves, but this film is proof that the man can act. His portrayal of John Wick is quite spot-on. And he can kick a lot of butt very impressively. Writing is not the best, but it gets the job done. This production has pretty good-looking sets, props, and costumes. Music choices, and the music score, feature really heavy beats and hard rock cues, and I found it awesome that way.John Wick, much like A Bittersweet Life, is a dark crime movie with lots of action, but also a lot of emotional backing behind its characters. It's a simple story that's told well and features plenty of satisfying setpieces.

"""Action Movie"" is an understatement. John Wick movies are non-stop fights and bloodbath shootouts.","""Action Movie"" is an understatement. All of the John Wick movies are non-stop fights and shootouts.A couple of problems are obvious. First, are there no Police Officers in the world? Wick can be in an office building, a church, the street, or a bar, and massive gunfights break out. Wick shoots 10 or 20 people or more, all Hell is breaking loose. But no Cops are ever around. Very unlikely! Exception: There is one neighborhood cop who shows up once in each movie (""Officer Jimmy""), but he must be on loan from the Mayberry Police Department, because he just greets John Wick, then goes on his way.Second, sure, Wick is a super tough guy, but no human being can get hit by cars, smacked over the head with a pipe, stabbed, shot, beat up... and then run a mile or more non-stop. It pushes the believability meter a bit too far.A third issue is the lack of a personal relationship. Yes, there is the dead wife, who appeared on his smartphone in a video in the first couple of films, and then in a snapshot photo in Parabellum (3). And, Wick is known by a lot of people, from the auto repair guy to the manager of The Continental. But there is no relationship, no romance, no buddies, Wick is a total loner. Oh, except for the dog with no name.And my fourth and final gripe is, how many hit men are there in the world? Wick encounters them two dozen at a time, no matter where he goes. The body count between all of the films must be 100 or more. Too many!Now to the good parts. The Mustang! Not since Bullitt has a Mustang been more featured in an action movie. Yes, there was ""Eleanor"" the Mustang in Gone in 60 seconds, but meh to that movie. Wick's car is the classic 69 Boss Mustang (it is claimed to be a Mach 1, but take a closer look, it is a Boss).Another plus - you would think that by Part 3, the writers would be running out of material. Nope... let's have two motorcycles chasing Wick, as he gallops away on a horse in downtown NYC traffic.As I said at the beginning of my review, if you want action, car chases, gunfire, lots of dead bad guys, high-class establishments and unique characters, ""John Wick"" is hard to beat!* * * * * * 6 Stars for John Wick * * * * * *Florida Fred.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
Baba Yaga is coming for you,"Summary: We watch the pure and intense emotional bond between a boy and an alien who meet by chance.This movie presents us with a gripping plot as well as excellent action sequences and these are really good reasons to call this movie good, but I think the movie's potential is wasted. In the movie, we see how sad John Wick is when his wife and dog die, but what we are sad about is not the death of his wife and dog, but the grief of John Wick. I think if the movie had been a little longer, and if John Wick had spent a little longer with his wife and dog, maybe then, I could have cared more about those characters.

"A sleak, fun ride at the expense of a detailed plot","2.5/4This is a very Good Friday night flick. You're home from work, and it's time to watch a movie. You don't want it to make you think, you just want good acting, lighting, direction, and cinematics, and no expenses on the plot. For that kind of night, this is a spectacular choice.First off, it's not at all that the plot is half-baked. There was no waste of paper writing this script. In John Wick, the plot comes in a half-portion. It is very simple and straightforward in an intriguing way. An oppressed ex-assassin is coping with the shame of his past-actions and the recent death of his wife. The last thing his wife gives him is a puppy. When the foolish son of his old crime-boss breaks into his house, kills the puppy, and takes off in Wick's Mustang...""Well I think I'm back!!""On another note, the actors really fit into their roles. Keanu Reeves, who is a veteran in stylized action sub-genre, really rocks Wick in much the same fashion he did Neo in The Matrix (1999). This time though, he takes on a much more cold, The-Man-In-Black type persona... a man of few words. The action sequences are quick, flashy, and all produce the same end result. It can get a tad monotonous after a while, but in the end it conveys John Wick as a character more. It shows that a broken man who has everything taken from him will have the most incentive to get to what he wants. Alfie Allen, although his character is never able to be presented in a likable, preforms his immature young adult criminal. Another very sublime detail that you might not pick up on is that the mob is very talky, profane, and excersises little patience, yet Wick is a thinker. John Wick is a character you can truly root for in his conquest to avenge his anguish.Cinematography proves another segway to the movie's stunning fluidity. Toward the beginning, Sela exaggerates very dark shades of black, and airy shades of white, giving the movie a very docile and harmless feel. As the plot unravels, you see the development of heavy greys kick in, and as the action sequences commence, neon and black become the dominant themes. It makes for a very tidy feature with slick fight sequences.Another item not usually found in this particular genre... a good balance of everything, from an editing standpoint right down to the acting. I was pleasantly suprised that John Wick had the delivery that it's predecessors seldom did.",,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
The Matrix 4?,"Keanu Reeves, is a problem. A really big problem. All of the characters that he plays, turn out to be Neo (The guy who saved us all from the machines in 'The Matrix'). They all even have the same face!!But seriously, the guy is perfect for a lot of the roles that he has won (The Matrix, Point Break, Speed), its just that its wearing a little thin now. One thing is for sure, other than a Razzie, Reeves wont ever be picking up an award.This film sees Reeves playing the titular part of 'John Wick'. We meet him just after he has lost his wife. Not in a shopping mall, or out on the beach silly....she has died very recently. There is something of a mystery around 'Wicks' history, who he is, what he does, where has he come from...but all those questions get answered throughout the film.The film asks little of Reeves. The action is blisteringly fast, and some of it is genuinely.....'Cool'. The gun fights and hand to hand combat are handled with a visual panache that I haven't seen in a few years. Chad Stahelski and his team certainly have a firm grasp of how a 'fight' should be conducted. The great thing about having an action film starring Keanu Reeves, is that with all the action taking place, there leaves little room for Reeves to talk. He really says only a hand full of words in this film.Dog lovers be ware, there is a scene on par with Mad Max 2. You have been warned, and you will end up hating Alfie Allen even more than you do watching Game Of Thrones.A classic, by no means, but this is the kind of film that you can disappear into, watch, and never think about again. I don't think I will ever watch it again, it was a perfect 'Throw away' film.A good waste of 2 hours on a Sunday night.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
Keanu Reeves doens't disappoint bringing us a great action franchise,"Reeves brings it all in this non-stop action movie.

***Warning****: A bit of spoilers! Pure Action film,"John Wick is a full on action movie. I wouldn't go into the plot of the movie. However, I will share my point of view as a critic:Positive: 1. The surprise element of the movie was John's old friend Marcus. The character gives a very good support to John and we get to know this only when he prevents John's death.2. The music used during the Action scenes was very good approach.3. The movie is very stylish overall.Negative: 1. Firstly, I was expecting some fist fight or any martial fight. There was two fights in the movie without the use of Gun. However, these fight were for very short duration.2. Lots and lots of shooting. At one point of time, I got the statement that John Wick is a very good hit-man or as they call Boogeyman. So, killing every mobs throughout the movie was a bit boring.3.

Masterpiece of action films,"The first John Wick is an absolute masterpiece of action cinema. With 3 additional films already released most people who didn't check this out when it was first released don't understand how explosive this film was when it showed up in theaters. There's been decades of action films but this one was just different. Every action set piece was executed perfectly and while it clearly a work of fiction and essentially a grounded superhero film in style, it's realistic in its approach to the film genre. Reeves took himself to another level in preparation for all these films but this is the one that set the bar for not just the remaining films in the series but for action films in general. The gun play is top notch, the hand to hand combat is fluid yet there is a struggle between combatants which gives it the realistic feel.I recommend the entire film series and each one just ups the ante as they go on but the first one is the most important action film since the 1980s.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"

Solid,"John Wick delivers a heavy dose of nice action sequences wrapped around a minimalist but effective storyline, as the main character gets dragged back into his old life in the underworld.

The Matrix done right,"John Wicks simplicity is what brings this movie from a minor league to a major league. John Wick in its glory gives us as viewers eye candy to watch over and over.

John Wick fails to deliver new action thrills and sticks with the same old movie tropes that we have become accustomed to.

Keanu Reeves gives his best performance in years in a strong action spectacular.,"Former assassin, John Wick (Keanu Reeves), has left behind his criminal past in favor of a quiet life with his wife, Helen (Bridget Moynahan). When Helen dies of a terminal illness five years later, John is devastated, but his wife posthumously arranged for a beagle puppy named Daisy to be delivered to John after her death. John bonds with the dog and allows John to feel still connected to his wife. When Iosef Tarasov (Alfie Allen), the spoiled, sadistic, arrogant son of crime boss Viggo Tarasov (Michael Nyqvist) takes a liking to John's '69 Mustang following a chance encounter at a gas station, Isoef makes an offer to buy the car which John flatly refuses. Later that night Iosef and his two thugs break into John's home killing Daisy and stealing John's car. After burying Daisy, John sets out on a path of vengeance as he chases Isoef through the criminal underworld while Viggo tries to protect Isoef by placing a contract on John.Written by direct-to-dvd action screenwriter Derek Kolstad of One in the Chamber and The Package, the foundation for John Wick began under the title Scorn with Kolstad seeking to evoke classic revenge and film noir classics with contemporary action stylings. Initially intended for a much older leading man (as popularized by Liam Neeson in the Taken films) the movie was rewritten and shown to Keanu Reeves who soon signed on. Reeves then contacted stunt specialist, Chad Stahelski and David Leitch (whom Reeves had worked extensively with on The Matrix films) hoping they'd wish to direct the film. Stahelski and Leitch jumped at the chance to work on the project with Reeves and the film when released ended up doing nearly double the expected box office that was projected and became critically acclaimed with word of mouth and advanced screenings making John Wick a dark horse that launched the directing careers of Stahelski and Leitch and was hailed as Keanu Reeves big comeback.While Keanu Reeves had major successes in the 90s with endearing classics like Point Break, Speed, and of course The Matrix, Reeves had stepped away from headlining major films following the end of the then Matrix Trilogy and the so-so performance of Constantine. While there were outliers such as The Day the Earth Stood Still remake and 47 Ronin (which originated as a supporting role but became a second lead following highly publicized reshoots) most of Reeves work had been in smaller scale productions or independent films. John Wick is without a doubt the strongest performance from Keanu Reeves since his turn as Bob Arctor in A Scanner Darkly in 2007. Reeves, despite a reputation for a stilted delivery, is very well utilized with his performance one of few words and more of facial expressions and body language with the opening scenes showing Wick's grief for his lost wife that culminates in the delivery of Daisy following her death truly heart wrenching scenes that make you invested in John as a character and helps you bond with the relationship between him and Daisy. And in addition to the physical performance, Reeves is at the top of his game in the action scenes doing approximately 90% of his own stunts and coupled with the strong directorial style of Stahelski and Leitch the action flows smoothly with minimal cuts and expertly crafted and timed choreography.The movie features a fantastic supporting cast with Alfie Allen an effectively hateful villain whose Iosef Tarasov is absolutely loathsome as the entitled preening sadist who serves as the impetus for John's rampage, the late Michael Nyqvist is also really strong playing Iosef's father Viggo whose controlled carefully planning crime boss makes a formidable antagonist for John to square off against. The movie also features some great turns by Willem Dafoe, Adrianne Palicki, John Leguizamo, Ian McShane, Bridget Moynahan, and Lance Reddick who add some strong personality to their characters and add to the richness of the world developed in the film. John Wick has some of the best world building I've seen in an action film with an established order based around this mysterious hotel called The Continental that serves as a neutral haven for the high end criminal element with its own monetary system of gold coins and an established code that when broken leads to undesirable consequences.The one point of criticism you can give this movie is that it's third act feels a little disjointed with the movie having seemingly come to its destination only for an additional climax to take place. While the action is still on point and the acting is still strong, it feels like the narrative flow could've been smoothed out by tying these two climactic sequences together into one rather than winding down from one only to jump into the other.John Wick is a white knuckle ride that despite its budget being on the lower end of the spectrum gives its audiences some of the most exhilarating and thrilling sequences in modern action cinema. Reeves gives his best performance in years and effortlessly handles both the action and acting needed for this protagonist, and a supporting cast of notable character actors brings life to this elaborate world and underworld created for the movie. While the plot does hiccup a little thanks to an additional climax, the movie has enough goodwill to make it a solid addition to any action fans required viewing list.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
Bloody brutal non-stop flick,"John Wick leaves you breathless from the amount of action and killing.

Wick is an assassin who cannot be defeated, apparently, since they've made a John Wick 2. But it's not for wont of trying because boy do the bad guys through everything at him including the kitchen sink.Keanu Reeves does a good job of being stoic, every so often throwing out cliché lines as he's killing people non stop.

John Wick,"An ex-hit-man comes out of retirement to track down the gangsters that took everything from him.John Wick is a new action movie starring Keanu Reeves, directed by David Leitch and Chad Stahelski. Since a little while I'm a huge fan of Keanu Reeves and I watched many of his interviews; he really seems to be a very cool and down to earth gentleman. I've heard and read many positive things about John Wick. It's one of the best action movie of the year and possibly Keanu Reeves' best performance since a long time. It doesn't arcane back to the 80's action movies ,actually it's an excellent 2014 action movie, no nostalgia required. Firstly, this film blew my mind and Keanu Reeves gives a lot of himself which is such a great thing to see. He is the perfect actor for the lead role. Everything he does is cool: driving, fighting, shooting and even speaking. All those things in general are what an action hero has to do in a good action movie. He is bad ass but also as he's retired for a certain time it makes him rusty enough to produce an interesting and tensional movie. Plus, John Wick is a slick looking movie, with fantastic action scenes and most importantly and surprisingly great dialogue scenes as well. The main villain of the movie starring Michael Nyqvist (Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol and Millennium) is absolutely terrific, Russians seems to always be the bad guys. In fact all the acting on this film is really good. I think it's actually Keanu Reeves' best film since The Matrix. Mainly because this film requires a lot of an actor, it's fantastic to see him properly doing the action scenes. He knows how to sell action; but I'm not only talking about physical work, he also has some very emotional scenes which involved a lot of anger and despair; he does a very great job with all of them. The screenplay is good, it's not only a revenge/ killing movie. There been a lot of action world creation, you learn a lot about these underworld war criminal. I completely understand why the hero goes on this bloody path. I have a dog. If anyone hurts my dog for any reason I'll do John Wick on them. Plus, the Club scene is the best scene of the whole movie, it reminds me of a club scene in Collateral which is crazy good action. However, the only flaw I could see in this film is the end; as my mum would say: the end seems a little bit forced up and a little bit put together really fast. That's it. Finally, John Wick also sets up ideas of sequel (not being forced like in The Maze Runner). You are able to see the character's evolution and the potential for a franchise along the movie. John Wick's the nicest guy ever just don't screw with him.Overall John Wick has incredible shoot out sequences, it's anon-stop action movie that actually has a clever script, a really awesome hero, a great villain (a few great villains actually). It does everything an action movie is supposed to do, it understands what its doing and does it extremely well. Go see this film!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
Decent Movie,"Rating: 6.4
Overall, a movie that is not so great in its own right with its lackluster direction, acting, and screenplay, but is an enjoyable watch because of its intense action scenes and character writing of John Wick (painting a character that will be fun to see what happens next to him).Pretty Bad Direction (The choreography of action sequences was very well done (Some of the best I have seen), but the moving of the story forward and the direction of actors was bad considering how dull the movie really was), Bad Acting (Pretty Good from Keanu Reeves (Able to handle the action sequences in a great way and is a strong prominent figure throughout the movie (With some good moments in dramatic acting), but has some really questionable scenes that may be in fault from the direction he was given), Acting on a Spectrum from the rest of the cast (Anywhere from very bad and emotionless (like Alfie Allen) to decent acting (like Willem Dafoe))), Good Story (Though it is filled with cliches of an ex-conman coming back into the fold, the storytelling and character writing of John Wick is very good to paint him as the ultimate figure to not be messed with), Pretty Bad to Decent Screenplay (The dialogue was very bland but there were some good moments), Score was just present (but did help in the action scenes when present), Good Cinematography, Good to Very Good Sound, Good Editing, Good Visual Effects (Especially, when showing the firefights), Good Costumes (Even though it is just a suit, they really helped create an iconic character in John Wick), Plot Structure was decent for the most part (but does follow a typical action-movie one), Pacing was incredible fast to where the runtime was very short (But this helps in giving pace to the character of John Wick), Build to climax was prevalent and noticeable in its prep for the action; climax was well executed and a fun part of the movie, Tone of the movie was very dark and grungy (adds to that John Wick feel); but there is a lot of dryness from the deadpan that it kinda takes away from this, The action scenes of the movie were some of the best choreographed action scenes I have ever seen as it is just so physical and technical that it keeps the audience engaged and wanting more.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
Badass action movie,"John wick is one of the most popular action gun fight movies with an amazing lead character that is very memorable and a name so iconic that a lot of people know him.The pacing is So good it's almost perfect thanks to the runtime being a little less than 2 hours which makes this movie not boring and has some great pacing without some boring filler that's a good move by the director ChadThe thing that is so good and surprising in this movie is how good the cast is , You've got the AWSOME keanu reeves and william Defoe and the two actors that I personally LOVED seeing is Ian McShane and Randall duk Kim , while those two didn't have the most screen time I loved seeing them because both of them are in one of my favorite movies (Kung fu panda ) and that's why I loved seeing those amazing voice actors in this AMAZING movieOverall this movie is done very right the pacing is very good the actor is amazing the set designs are cool and the dialogue is very good and the story is very simple yet very well written and the casting is SO good!

Slick shoot em up with stylish visuals but anorexic plot.,"Of its genre, a quite entertaining if ultimately absurd way to spend a couple of hours of your life. Other posters have gone into the plot discrepancies before and considering there isn't really what you could call a plot then these are major flaws. The only slightly interesting plot element is the Continental hotel, a hotel for hit men (and hitwomen) where psychopathic killers can be assured a good nights sleep without fear of being attacked by other psychopathic killers. Perhaps there is a hole in the market for that sort of thing....But if you are able to overlook the films flaws you will find much to like here. It is slickly and stylishly shot, the action sequences( of which there are many )are well paced and choreographed in a style which borrows heavily from MMA, its has a strong supporting cast and even Keanu Reeves looks convincing.There is a time and a place for this sort of film and it does what it sets out to do with a degree of flair, and I for one wouldn't mind seeing more of John Wick.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
better than johnny mnemonic,"Well this isn't Reeve's worst film. It's probably somewhere in the middle. It reminds me a lot of those mindless 80s action films that were led by Silvester Stallone, Arnold Schwarzenegger and Chuck Norris.The plot is simple. No problem. This is an action film and there's plenty of it. Think 80s action films but with more gore and intensity. It all looks pretty too.This is supposed to be a fun movie. I get it. But it would've been nice to see more realistic gun fights that showed John Wick's using his entire repertoire of skills to take out dozens of armed gunmen instead of just showing his incredible quickness and ridiculous gun shooting accuracy.I'm not sure how this film got rated above a 7. The film looks pretty but the script is awful and the characters are uninteresting. If you want to watch an action film that's been recently released and are similar to this I suggest watching either Shooter or Olympus Has Fallen. These films are just as violent but are more interesting to watch.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"

Where does one begin...,"My goodness, there I was, thinking that usually Keanu Reeves makes movies that are worth watching.In this great big pile of dreadful formulaic twaddle, full of loopholes wider than the gap between here and Mars, it appears we have a superhero who can kill 12 huge, grown men all toting sophisticated weaponry, in about a minute and yet... struggles with one tiny woman for what felt like hours, totally unable to either disarm or do away with her. Did I mention formulaic drivel? Reeves, 'the boogeyman' manages to annihilate reams of people in a revenge spree, filled with rage at the death of his wife, dog and... well, the theft of his car.The very worst soundtrack in living history. The longest nightclub fight scene in all time, no script, no acting, over dramatized, utterly dreadful dark, barely discernible scenes, quips, nothing said, nothing really accomplished, nothing worth watching.If you can't wait to watch a really bad c grade movie, yep, this'll do it for you!

Glued to the screen,"John wick was something very fresh in an age of action movies, what I believe drove it's success and appeal to an audience that seemed to grow and grow was the hand to hand combat, John using many different fighting techniques, weapons and all of it felt and looked so real, there were so many continuing shots and it's a testament to Keanu who performed the majority of his own stunts.The story is simple, his wife passes and leaves him a dog who ends up getting killed by a Russian thug who is the son of a high up Russian mobster. Believe me when I say it's not the story we show up for, it's nice to get it and in further movies we do, but it's the action.With so many comic movies and other action movies I can't think of many that even come close to these fight scenes, Netflix Daredevil would be the closest.I enjoyed most of this movie, not to gone on the last 20 minutes to be honest but overall it's a fantastic movie.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
Shoot 'em Up,"There's something simple yet brilliant about the concept of a film that fills in all the gaps of our imagination and attention span, one that refuses to dilly dally with furthering plot points and ulterior motives that lead characters to do the things they do and say the things they say. 'John Wick' brings us everything we wished for from quick action, simple story, and an accessible premise--get the guys who killed my dog and stole my car. What's even more brilliant than the simple story is the style this debut director has developed almost by accident. We have excellent neo-noir cinematography, quick and witty dialogue, and grungy 90's video game rock play in our eardrums, sprinkled in with excessive gun violence and relentless kick-assery.

A Stunning Achievement in Action: John Wick Combines Thrilling Action Sequences with Emotional Depth,"John Wick is a movie that has quickly become a classic in the action genre. The film stars Keanu Reeves as the title character, a retired hitman who is forced back into the game after the death of his wife and the theft of his prized possession - a vintage Mustang.One of the most impressive things about John Wick is its stunning action sequences. The choreography is impeccable, with Reeves and the stunt team pulling off some truly breathtaking moves. The fight scenes are intense and violent, but never feel gratuitous or over-the-top. They are always in service of the story, and serve to highlight the skill and determination of John Wick.But what sets John Wick apart from other action movies is its attention to detail. Every aspect of the film feels carefully crafted and considered, from the stunning cinematography to the intricate world-building. The film takes place in a unique universe where hitmen have their own currency, hotels, and rules of engagement. It's a world that feels both familiar and completely new.One of the standout performances in the film comes from Willem Dafoe as Marcus, a fellow hitman and friend of John Wick. Dafoe brings a quiet intensity to the role, and his scenes with Reeves crackle with chemistry and tension. Another standout is Michael Nyqvist as Viggo Tarasov, the film's main villain. Nyqvist plays Viggo with a quiet menace, making him a formidable opponent for John Wick.But ultimately, the film belongs to Reeves. He brings a quiet intensity to the role, conveying both the pain and determination of a man who has lost everything. His physical performance is also incredibly impressive, with Reeves performing many of his own stunts and fight scenes. It's clear that he put in a lot of work to bring John Wick to life, and it pays off in spades.One of the things that sets John Wick apart from other action movies is its commitment to world-building. The film creates a rich, complex universe that feels like it could exist outside of the confines of the film itself. From the Continental Hotel, a safe haven for hitmen, to the intricate rules that govern the world of assassins, every detail is considered and adds to the overall experience of the film.But despite its impressive world-building and stunning action sequences, what really sets John Wick apart is its emotional core. At its heart, the film is a story of love and loss, of a man driven to violence by his grief. It's a powerful and relatable story, and one that elevates the film beyond its genre trappings.Overall, John Wick is a stunning achievement in the action genre. It's a film that is both beautiful and brutal, with incredible performances and some of the best action sequences in recent memory. It's a film that deserves to be seen and celebrated, and one that will undoubtedly stand the test of time. If you haven't seen it yet, do yourself a favor and check it out.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
A great action movie,"This is a great action movie. The premise is as simple as it is effective: John Wick loses everything, and goes on a revenge spree. The reason why it works so well, is that the characters and the setting are both very interesting, and the action scenes are very good.The movie is set in an almost comic book like world, where there's a community of hit men and people in the underworld, with their own set of morals and code. They all use certain businesses (or services), which ties them all together. It's this universe that makes me curious for sequels to John Wick. The characters in this universe are mostly quite fun, and a lot of that owes to great casting. The way they gradually reveal John Wick's past is interesting, and it leaves you wanting to know more about who he once was.But, despite all the good things about the movie, it never elevates above its genre.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"

John Wick is a standout entry in the action genre,"I recently revisited John Wick (2014) on Netflix. The film follows a retired assassin who emerges from retirement following a devastating home invasion that results in the death of his beloved dog. Seeking vengeance, Wick hunts down those responsible, leaving a trail of destruction in his wake.Directed by Chad Stahelski (known for the John Wick series), the film features a stellar cast including Keanu Reeves (The Matrix), Willem Dafoe (Spider-Man), John Leguizamo (Spawn), Ian McShane (Deadwood), Alfie Allen (Game of Thrones) and David Patrick Kelly (The Warriors).For fans of the action genre, John Wick is a feast for the senses. Reeves shines as the stoic yet relentless hero, while Leguizamo and McShane deliver captivating supporting performances. Dafoe's presence adds an extra layer of intrigue to the narrative. The film sets up its backstory and circumstances effectively, and the action sequences are nothing short of spectacular. With well-choreographed fight scenes and impressive gore, the film keeps audiences on the edge of their seats. The intense shootouts are executed with precision, making it easy to rally behind the protagonist in his quest for justice. Plus, the film boasts a memorable soundtrack that complements the adrenaline-pumping action.In conclusion, John Wick is a standout entry in the action genre, earning a solid 7.5-8/10 rating and a strong recommendation.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"

totally boring and utterly ridiculous movie,"though i usually enjoy more movies where there is a delicate balance between substance and style - the film has an intelligent story and characterization that produces deep emotions, too - i also find great and perhaps a little guilty pleasure watching action films once in a while but this is one of the films in its genre in which i simply do not find anything enjoyable or pleasurable at all. it is totally boring and utterly ridiculous watching experience and i only wonder why on earth it was ever even made in the first place? there is NOTHING original. everything has been seen hundreds of times in hundreds of other movies...the characters are silly the story is totally predictable almost in every turn and there is absolutely no humor which may be the worst thing of all: all the people concerned producing this piece of stupid crap take themselves so damn too seriously and that is the most apparent source of yawn breaking boredom most viewers must feel at it. it is just another stupid piece of dull action cinema.keanu reeves who is still a sight for most female and many male sore eyes even in his fifties cannot save it (i think quite few women would have the overwhelming interest to watch the film despite its handsome protagonist). reeves as a retired professional hit man is as irritating cardboard character as anything else in the film. for most male viewers it is still enough if you slaughter a hundred guys around you with a relevant weapons arsenal and sprinkle blood on the walls in endless killing euphoria while on your vengeance tour de force but that kind of treatment when consistent all the way from the beginning to the end rarely makes a very good action movie. there must be something more.i admit that south koreans who are the real masters of the action genre nowadays have sometimes managed to do a fair movie from the scratch but this film crew has not been able to do so.total waste of time.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"

aesthetic and violent,"As John Wick: Chapter 2 is on screens and gets unexpected good reviews and not only from fans, I thought that it's a good opportunity to see the first and original John Wick which also received some positive echos, much above what is typically delivered for a film in its genre. It's certainly a matter of setting expectations, but I personally was not disappointed. If violent action movies are one of the genres that entertain you, good chances that you will not be disappointed either.Rule #1 to enjoy such a film is to accept the conventions of the genre. The story takes place in the parallel universe of the crime underworld. Although bodies start to accumulate in piles pretty soon, there is no policeman in view with the exception of one cop showing up at one point, looking at the scene of the carnage and wishing good evening to the hero who happens to be a professional killer. This parallel universe is not lawless, it's just that the laws or better said the rules are different. There is a code of honor, there are territories of neutrality, and there is only one punishment - death - for breaking rules or trespassing borders. At the roots of the story stands a failed tentative by the main hero to break the cycle of violence of his profession and jump in the universe of normal people. All this is just memories when the action starts. This film is for Keanu Reeves what 'Jack Reacher' is for Tom Cruise and I suspect that at some point even taking the name of the hero as a title is not a coincidence. It's the start of a series and the second installment was not too late to come.Assuming you bought into the story and the convention, there is some good stuff to enjoy. Stuntman Chad Stahelski is sitting for the first time on the film director chair and he delivers exactly what is expected - a coherent story telling and perfect choreography of the many action scenes that occupy more than half of the duration of the movie. Keanu Reeves delivers what is expected, and a few other fine actors show up in small and even smaller supporting roles. Cinematography is just beautiful, with combinations of dark colors that fit well the violent dark universe that they populate. If you can just forget how sketchy the whole story (or pretext) of the film is, you have good reasons to enjoy it.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
Essentially a slick revenge action cartoon,"It's a human revenge action cartoon set in the 2010s in New York City and New Jersey. It follows a former hitman, John Wick (Keanu Reeves), for the Russian Mafia, who left the criminal life to marry Helen (Bridget Moynahan) a little over five years previously. Helen dies of a fatal disease but bequeaths a little beagle puppy to aid in his grief. However, Iosef Tarasov (Alfie Allen), the son of Russian Mafia leader Viggo Tarasov (Michael Nyqvist), has an encounter with Wick that ends in Iosef stealing Wick's prize car, killing the beagle, and injuring Wick.This incident draws Wick into revenge mode that, by some counts, results in 80 deaths--77 of them by John Wick. Some of the more interesting characters he engages with include fellow assassin Ms. Perkins (Adrianne Palicki), former mentor and expert sniper Marcus (Willem Dafoe, and Viggo Tarasov's attorney, Avi (Dean Winters). By the end of this movie, Dean Winters looks a lot like his character in the mayhem insurance ads.One can only describe ""John Wick"" as a cartoon. The body count (more than one every two minutes), the accuracy of Wick's shooting, the superficial character development, the limited plot, and the breakneck action after a soulful introduction all suggest a cartoon. Keanu Reeves acts and looks like a decent anti-hero. Despite all the violence, there is surprisingly little blood. The body count apparently goes up in all the subsequent Wick movies, so one of these might be enough. It was entertaining for one time, though.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"

Great ACTION Film,"I have no earthly idea why people want this to be anything else than it is supposed to be - it is an endless shoot em' out. It is unashamed of this, it boldly pronounces this.

If you're looking for something deep, look elsewhere.This is not to say that there is no plot - the story fits in (and thought-out the sequels) nicely enough. This should be seen in light of the other movies, as a collection or part of one panoramic picture. In doing so, you will unearth the plot which I will not be spoiling here.If you're sick of what one would stuggle to call a ""storyline"" in modern movies, this is great break from that. It is akin to The Northman, one of these gems or an 'out' for the typical trash in circulation.Keanu Reeves plays his part excellently. Cold, ruthless, and original.

A Great B movie on a mainstream market,"Aahhh, it took me a while to watch this movie, because it looks like just another bad action flick, the poster is not helping either. I love films, from foreign, docs,festival to the Hollywood blockbusters of all genres. I hunt for certain directors, and I do love intellectual films or some might call them art flicks. But the genre that I do miss is the action trash ( grind house films ) In the glory days of VHS, many films were released only for the VHS market. Many of those are the simple, dirty action films, some are bad and some are so bad it's great. Well..John Wick reminds me of that. No BS, revenge films.If you are aware of the Charles Bronson's Death wish, John wick has a similar idea.

Great Movie,"John Wick is a well made movie with good acting, visual effects, and sound design. Although the concept of its plot is a bit stupid, it was able to expound on it and make it less shallow by giving it more background and motive. One of the best aspects is its acting. The movie's action scenes were well made, and the actors chosen to fit these roles performed well in these scenes. This, combined with well done visual effects and sound design, kept the audience on the edge of their seats. But despite this, the concept the plot is based of is quite shallow. Though the writers gave it more background and motive in an attempt to expound on the concept, their efforts are unable to fully mask its flaws in the plot.For me, this movie was able to differentiate itself from most of the other action films that I have watched. What made the movie stick out for me was its ability to take a generally predictable plot formula and expound on it. Although storyline is not the movie's strongest points, thee film's writers were able to mask the concept and change the sequence ""formula"" to make it less predictable and more interesting.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
"Yeah, I'm Thinking Keanu Reeves Is Back!","American cinema has been continually producing very bland and forgettable action movies (The Equalizer serves as a recent example— does anyone even remember that movie?). This year's earlier martial arts showcase, The Raid 2, easily beats out everything else from the genre's crop, and that is especially including the Marvel/superhero movies that are more about spectacular set pieces than innovative, fascinating action choreography. Well, maybe the American Kung-Fu fan/renowned action star is the best chance we have at an effective American action film at this point.""People keep asking if I'm back; yeah, I'm thinking I'm back!"" Keanu Reeves returns to staple badassery as John Wick who has recently lost his wife to cancer. After the painful funeral, he unexpectedly receives a delivery package at his door—a final gift from his wife in order to help ease his grief: a cute, little dog. Of course, trouble never ceases to find Wick and after unintentionally pissing off a group of Russian mobsters at a gas station, they give him an unpleasant visit where he witnesses the murder of his dog and suffers a brutal beating. Oh, it's on! Little do those guys know who they're messing with—a bogeyman who has even spooked the mob boss into beating some sense into his culprit son and letting him know what exactly he has done. John Wick—with his deadly skills teased and his true background mysterious— readies his weapons, and pure ruthless revenge ensues from there on out.The movie accomplishes just what American action cinema fails at every time. The action sequences are filmed with the use of astonishing cinematography—plenty of wide shots to perfectly display everything that transpires on-screen without confusing the audience. The camera invariably gives us a good layout of the particular environment, which is followed by John Wick's clever utilization of those surroundings to break bones and rupture skulls. In fact, the film is so embellished with glitzy style that even its subtitles come all vibrantly colored with a catchy font and ingenious screen placement.The majority of the film is set at nighttime, and thus, we get that metropolitan vibe along with a dusky color palette—an alluring greenish/bluish hue. In addition, a groovy, cool soundtrack incessantly complements the impressive action sequences; the best segment taking place in a violet-lit, intensely-staged night club as guns blaze and dubstep drowns out the screams. And despite Keanu Reeve's transparently limited acting range, this tough-as-nails role certainly plays to his strengths with the intimidating monotone one-liner delivery and that never-ending, rigid look of sheer ire.Unlike The Raid 2 however, there's no compelling narrative to give the film's duration any necessity to continue. John Wick simply comprises one action scene after another. Unfortunately, the combat gets repetitive fairly quickly—repeating wrestling techniques (choke holds, etc.) and blowing brains out with the same up-close strategy—and it honestly feels like the plot struggles with where to proceed next. ""Oh, I need to kill this guy, and now I have to kill this other guy in another location."" The story essentially follows this formula and hopes that the viewers find that adequate enough for non-stop entertainment. An hour in though, it clearly begins to drag and doesn't show any sort of storytelling restraint in terms of when enough is enough, which is the same issue The Equalizer shared.If this high-octane extravaganza was only slimmed down by thirty minutes, it would've made for a far more satisfying and memorable experience, but I just can't say that John Wick even compares to the consistent mastery The Raid 2 boasted. This one has its fair share of cheesy, awkward moments (albeit with intention) but also just overall shallowness. With that being said, beholding the first hour alone makes it worth seeing over every American action movie this year (I still don't know if that says a lot about the staleness of the genre nowadays, or if I should just accept that John Wick surely possesses stunning quality?).",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"

Brilliant fight sequences mixed with some painfully bad scenes,"I am a big Keanu Reeves fan. I was looking forward to this movie and for the most part I was watching it with a huge smile on my face.The action is brilliant. Reeves does some original stuff in his fight sequences and makes them look believable.But there were several scenes which took the movie down a few pegs in my opinion. Keanu's super tough character John Wick struggling to take down a girl who looks more like she should be selling perfume than she would be capable of fighting and killing? Sorry, this is not remotely believable.John Wick getting caught and needing to be saved time and again throughout the film? How amateurish. Watch the Bourne trilogy instead. Bourne never made the mistake of letting anyone know where he was, which is why he was always a step ahead of his pursuers. If he ever got picked up he'd planned it in advance so as to attain information. By contrast John Wick continually blundered into situations that would have seen his end in an even half way real world.But the fight scenes were original and awesome. Oh yeah, and regarding Keanu's acting being terrible, which is what I've read from others here on the discussion board and in reviews: he cries when he reads his wife's letter and he makes it look more believable than most actors I've seen dealing with similar emotional scenes. His acting was great.So, will you walk away from this film considering it a masterpiece?

Storytelling is Good Copying,"All the below are non-creative copying of past movies (done many times before): 1. Opening scene - alarm clock going off. 2. Coffee brewing. 3. Casket being lowered; raining for effect; long shot of cemetery showing stranger watching. 4. Afterwards, solemn wake party. 5. Mystery package at door. From? Of course. 6. Bad guys are (Guess what nationality?) $1000 if you have no idea. And, of course, are as stereotypic as cut-out doll figures. 7. Older hot cars and lots of squealing tires, burning rubber (or synthetic equivalent). You would think Reeves character would be past that 17 year old's infatuation. 8. Master killer still has an arsenal hidden away, why? Anticipated this precise series of events unfolding many years earlier. Or, nostalgia. 9. Reeves is covered in tats, of course, to show us toughness. Russian iconic tats no less - oops! 10. Dozen (cheaper that way) bad guys need some skill training because they're slow, dumb and can't seem to shoot at a target a few feet away and always walk around corners without looking first. 11. Been done before ""cleaning crew"" just a call away to dispose of waste animal tissue (human of course). They always look the same in these movies. 12. Usual cheap scene filler, and getting really tedious, helicopter shot of city and car traveling on road below (even did a several times). 13. Background music the usual rock/blues/alter/jazz sound. 14. Barely clothed chicks tossed in for the male viewer and one to be bad. 15. Same old club scenes with strobes. 16.

Fast and furious solo,"James Bond, Jack Bauer, Jason Bourn, Jack Reacher, John Carter, and now John Wick - writers do seem to have limited imaginations when it comes to the names of their action heroes. JW is a retired assassin and we all know that, in the movies, it doesn't take much to bring a man with ""a very particular set of skills"" back into the game. Kidnapping his daughter usually does it but, if you want to be sure, kill his dog. This really makes Wick (Keanu Reeves back on cracking form) mad. Of course, we knew who the bad guys were even before their mistake with the mutt because they speak Russian and the subtitles are presented in comic book style to add to the fun.There's minimal plot but maximum action in this film directed by Chad Stahelski (Keanu's stunt double in ""The Matrix"") and David Leitch (another veteran stunt coordinator). Wick is not out simply to disable his foes but instead never leaves death in doubt and he is no silent assassin but absolutely litters the screen in bodies in a riot of action and noise that somehow escapes the notice of the New York Police Department. According to those who count these things, the original ""Taken"" movie clocked up a body count of 35 but Wick racks up a much superior 76.I saw the movie on an IMAX screen so I was both shaken and stirred.",,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
A kick-ass action which will pump up your adrenalin,"One thing I noted while watching John Wick was its simple story told with fascinating execution and commendable action scenes, and that is the beauty of this film which was over-stretched in the climax but was saved by outstanding script.John Wick is an ex-hit-man who comes out of his retirement in search of a mafia's son who was responsible for killing his dog, the last gift sent by his late wife.First time directors, Chad Stahelski and David Leitch did pretty well in shaping the movie to be a blunt and taut revenge action-packed thriller. The movie takes sometime to build on but when it does , there is no turning back. Each scene is beautifully depicted with rocking background score and applauding dialogues. It gives an holistic view of gangland and rules they live in and high respect for each other. Icing on the cake is the well-choreographed action scenes which has been executed brilliantly with graphic bloodshed looking like a PC game. Script is tight and will keep you engaged. The flip-side is unnecessary inclusion of climax scenes which could be easily be edited. Keanue Reeves is back in form and I loved him after long time especially post Matrix series. He does well in dialogues delivery and will be appreciated for his acting.Overall, a kick-ass action which will pump up your adrenalin. Good 3/5",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"

Solid Action But Without Substance,"I love a good revenge story. There is about these kind of tales we can get behind, choose a side, and that's usually enough to justify the violence in most movies nowadays. John Wick is a revenge story, and on merits of it's action scenes a pretty amazing ride. However where it excels in quick paced action it certainly leaves a lot to be desired in story.John Wick is a well to do man in his 30's, seemingly wealthy, and in love. His wife is beautiful and she has a way of making him whole, but these things rarely last, and his world is about to come apart at the seems. He has a hidden past, something he isn't proud of, but it's what has given him this life of luxury and the ability to spend so much time with his wife. Shortly after the beginning of the film, in which we find our main character badly wounded, we enter a series of flashbacks where we learn his wife had become ill to some unknown disease, and he has very little time to process this loss. As events unfold, John returns to his old ways, on a killing spree against new foes and some old ones as well.The story that unfolds isn't great by any means, but there are some real amazing action sequences of such military precision that they are a pleasure to watch. Keanu Reeves underwent 4 months of firearms training and it really shows through his work. Some of the best action sequences are the close quarters hand to hand combat, where John Wick used a lot of Japanese Jujitsu, but incorporates his firearm in so many of the moves (slightly reminiscent of the film Equilibrium 2002). Although some might be turned off by the level of violence and high body count, this is really why you watch a movie like this.Unfortunately the plot itself is so outrageously thin and badly written that it kind of ruins the whole thing for me. When I think of the classic revenge story, a few titles come to mind right away. Oldboy (2013) or Django Unchained (2012) for example. The main characters of these films are men obsessed with revenge, and you can easily understand why the characters would go to such lengths to get back at the people who have done wrong by them. This is what John Wick is missing, I couldn't understand why a man would throw his life away for the memory of someone who is already dead. He goes up against an army of Mafioso's and leaves bodies all over the city, and anyone who gets in his way is a dead man... but why? I couldn't grasp that concept in this film, and it left me so unsatisfied and crying in disbelief.So, it does have some of the best fire fights I've seen in a film, and excellent hand to hand choreography (Michael Nyqvist nearly lost an ear!), but the whole premise of the movie kind of fell flat in my eyes. But I hear this is the first in a trilogy so they have lots of room to improve story line in the future.6/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
One of the most praised action movies of all time.,"John Wick..
One of the most praised action movies of all time...One of the defining traits of John Wick is his commitment to efficiency; he moves with tactical precision to waste no movement and often kills his target without giving them room for any ceremonious last words before their demise. Keanu Reeves deserves immense credit for his dedication to tactical training and personal fitness to ensure that he does the vast majority of his own stunts, which is evident in the final product. Few actors are able to do what he does on screen, and even fewer are able to make cohesive action stories that effectively display the mastery of that craft. That dedication to making every second count is palpable in the pacing of the films.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"

John Wick is one of the best action movies of all time,"John Wick is not a regular action film, its a film that has a lot of technical dimensions which are very wrong to be ignored, some people maybe sees it as a normal action movie like any other action movie, without a beginning or end or story, but what is the interpretation of these proposals ? They are nothing more than subjective opinions which we can't rate a work based on them. So what makes this film great ?There are 3 reasons:1 - The special new story and what it contains from expressions that describe the situation of the exhausting, retired and regrettable human and the most important is the lonely, and what it means to live inside this shell.2 - While watching the film we touch the summary of the achievements of action films between its scenes, is not a classic film but it has a classic taste is not a film entirely modern but it has a modernity taste, cause its scenes take us on a journey of suspense inside two stages mixed in one new stage I can't name it but John Wake's stage.3 - Fighting scenes, the way its been filmed and the operating of the camera, its very hard to explain this point or to explain the feeling that sends by it but I can say that the fighting style is not just a simple style like any other action film but its much more than that, not because he can kill 100 men during 5 minutes but I think the director wanted the fighting scenes to be like a video game regarding the movies and the camera operating way, because the audience feels exactly like he's/she's in front of fighting chapter in a game and they should pass it and they can't leave the controller just waiting the next hit to see where its gonna come, until they forget that they are watching a movie not a video game and that because of the intensity of the scene and how strongly it attracting the eye and the adrenaline.John Wake film raised action movies to a higher stag.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
John Wick (2014),"John Wick (Keanu Reeves) is a widower who receives a final parting gift from his recently deceased wife. A companion in a form of a puppy who he was informed to cherish as he grieves alone. Coincidentally crossing paths with three sadistic men who threaten to tear down his world. John reverts back to the previous life that he dutifully tried to leave behind in order to begin anew. Carefully unveiled to be the most ruthless assassin to have ever lived known as Baba Yaga, The Boogeyman. John seeks to settle the score with the memory of his loved one as fuel to the fire.Despite the familiar premise, John Wick is more than just an average vengeance tale. The focus is centered on a broken individual who desperately wants to hold onto what is most valuable to him. Dos vidanya, to anyone who tries to take what does not rightfully belong to them. Keanu Reeves gives a tour-de-force performance as the titular character. Encapsulating all of the emotional drive and vulnerability of a man who simply has nothing to lose. Quite unfortunate that Reeves' career was on a nose-drive before his initiation into the franchise. This film not only revitalized his career but showcases his talent as Reeves' had performed 95% of his own stunts for the outstanding action sequences in the film. Making the character his own that is now adored by fans of the action genre. John Wick is a powerhouse introduction for what has been deemed as one of the greatest action-oriented franchises of all time. The lore is simply fascinating as there is another world going on that is invisible to the naked eye with all members using a unique transaction system, bearing tattoos and assassinating for hire. Abiding by certain rules that must never be crossed. The sound design including the tracks ""Killing Strangers"" by Marilyn Manson, ""Think by Kaleida"", and ""Who You Talkin' to Man?"" by Ciscandra Nostalghia, set the atmosphere

Then the rest of the movie is filled with revenge seeking action. It's almost like one long action scene.It is a very entertaining action style. The gunfights are very stylish and innovative.

Maybe not my taste..,"I believe action movies are not quite my thing, as most Hollywood action is generic these days. John Wick the latest one I saw, is overall quite similar to another recent action flick The Equalizer. One retired specialist is brought back in action to destroy an entire mafia gang. It may entertain hardcore action lovers, but for me its utter boredom. At least, The Equalizer was backed up with some story, which is almost absent here. John Wick is an ex-hit-man who had retired to leave peacefully with his wife. Unfortunately she dies o cancer and all John Wick is left with is his super-cool Mustang and the dog his wife leaves as a gift. But John is pulled back into the action when his car is stolen and dog killed by the mafia head's son. Driven by grief and revenge he decides to take down the people involved using his super-hit-man skills. That's basically the entire story and what fills the 100 minutes is routine monotonic action sequence. They are not bad being nicely shot and well-choreographed actually. The problem is the lack of intent and the totally predictable nature of the script which made it less engaging. There aren't any twist in the story too which is surprising. Just plain straight forward action. If that's all you I believe you will end up having a good time.Just like in The Equalizer, John Wick easily kills dozens of men failing to do so only twice and both the times escapes in what I would say the lamest part of he script. I found it hardly realistic. There is absolutely no tension built up as you know that John Wick can easily kick everyone's asses. Character build up is weak, dialogues just forward the action sequences and acting nothing special. Keenu Reeves gives an honest attempt though, still I couldn't connect with John Wick that much to completely root for him. To end, this was just another forgettable action film for me.RATING: [2/5]",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"

In the run up to the 4th movie I have decided to re watch the first 3 movies again, I have seen them a handful of times and I do really enjoy them !!! So I may aswell fire up a review !!John wick 1 was something very fresh in an age of action movies, what I believe drove it's success and appeal to an audience that seemed to grow and grow was the hand to hand combat, John using many different fighting techniques, weapons and all of it felt and looked so real, there were so many continuing shots and it's a testament to Keanu who performed the majority of his own stunts.The story is simple, his wife passes and leaves him a dog who ends up getting killed by a Russian thug who is the son of a high up Russian mobster. Believe me when I say it's not the story we show up for, it's nice to get it and in further movies we do, but it's the action.With so many comic movies and other action movies I can't think of many that even come close to these fight scenes, Netflix Daredevil would be the closest.I enjoyed most of this movie, not to gone on the last 20 minutes to be honest but overall it's a fantastic movie. 8.5/10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
Ruthlessly efficient action that still left me wanting,"Word-of-mouth can be very useful in gauging if a film is worth seeing or not, but it can also lead to erroneous expectations. I went into this thinking it would be this absolutely awesome action romp, and to a degree that's true. I just thought it would also be a little more fun. JOHN WICK is by no means a bad film, but one that seems satisfied with a cool soundtrack and brutal, well-choreographed action while having a rather weak foundation of a story. The setup is that John Wick (Keanu Reeves) is an ex-hit-man who gets dragged back into the life after a Russian gangster's upstart son foolishly steals his car and murders his dog. That's it. I wasn't expecting anything deep, mind you, but I would have liked a little more complexity and intrigue. It was straight-forward almost to the point of being boring at times, and without a lot of the production and character design that fleshed out something like MAD MAX FURY ROAD, or the manic humor of KINGSMAN: THE SECRET SERVICE. To the film's credit, the action goes against the current trend of flashy camera-work and tricky editing, so one is able to comprehend and appreciate the brutality and choreography. And even though a lot of it takes place at night, geography is never in question and you can tell where people are in relation to each other. These elements were also well-supported by some good special effects, bullet hits, etc. In terms of the world of the film, there were a few nice touches that hinted at a complex criminal underworld, one where assassins have their own hotel and criminals use their own currency. The film was also well-acted for the most part, despite the characters being so shallow apart from Keanu Reeves' John Wick. To me, the film largely wasted talented actors like Ian McShane, Michael Nyqvist and Willem Dafoe by not really giving them anything fun or interesting to do. When it comes down to it, all the film really has is Keanu Reeves' charisma and some admittedly good action, and that wasn't really enough for me. Bringing this back full-circle, expectations can make or break a film and I think I went into this expecting a little too much. For the die-hard action fan who doesn't really care how much story goes along the beatings and bullets, JOHN WICK will do just fine. For those who expect a little more from a film, there's plenty of others to choose from.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"

I was expecting at least a plausible story line and gripping action with Keanu Reeves in it. But Reeves acting was SO shallow and unbelievable, as was everyone else's. The plot was barely existent and everything in it was just a repeat of so many other movies. The action was stiff and repetitive, and absolutely lacking in reality. The story was unbelievable to the point of being ridiculous, and the concept of Reeves being able to do even a small portion of what he was pictured to do, was just absurd.

"Brilliant action, sketchy storyline! 6/10","Review: After listening to all of the hype surrounding this movie, I'm glad that I finally got to watch it! The plot was a bit weird but I enjoyed the Matrix style, gun tooting action. The last few Keanu Reeves movies have shown a moody side to his acting, compared to the earlier days of Bill & Ted and I must admit, I'm kind of liking it. His no nonsense demeanor really worked as John Wick but there script was a bit sketchy. Anyway, the movie is about a ex- assassin who has recently lost his wife and become a recluse in his house with his dog, which his wife got delivered to him after she passed away. Whilst filling up his car at a petrol station, some Russian gangsters offer him money for his car but he kindly turns them down and he goes on his way. This is were the plot was a bit weak in my opinion! For some random reason, the Russian gangsters turn up at his house and they beat him up, take his car and kill his dog. I was hoping that there was going to be a twist in the story which would make that aspect make sense but they were just being total out of order. Anyway, John Wick (Keanu Reeves) decides to go on a killing rampage, trying to get to the culprit who killed his dog but he has to go through the Russian mafia which puts his life in danger, along with his close friends. The storyline is pretty straight forward but there are a few elements that were a bit sketchy to me. Now, he's supposed to be an untouchable assassin who people call the ""Boogeyman"" but he was getting beat up, near to death in most of the action scenes. I don't know if the director was trying to make it seem realistic or not, but the way that some of the characters was describing John Wick is yet to be seen. OK, he was going around by himself causing havoc in New York but if it wasn't for Willem Dafoe, he would have died a few times in the film. With that aside, I did like the action scenes and the whole dark, intense feel to the film really worked. There definitely has to be a sequel because the John Wick character is really needed in Hollywood at the moment. Enjoyable!Round-Up: I really can't believe that Keanu Reeves is 51 and it's now that he's decided to become a action hero. I suppose it's after all the training from the Matrix movies! Anyway, his movie career started in 1986 in the popular Youngblood, ice hockey movie with Rob Lowe and Patrick Swayze but he really hit the big time with the Bill & Ted movies in 1989. After getting branded as a comedic actor, which he didn't like, he decided to turn to action movies with Point Break in 1991 and Speed in 1994. In between those movies he took the lead in Bram's Stokers Dracula, which didn't go down well with the critics because of his accent and Little Buddha which also was a bit of a failure but he bounced back with the Devil's Advocate and, of course, the Matrix trilogy. Since then, he has struggled to find a genre that he was comfortable with and he starred in various movies like Hard Ball, Sweet November and the Gift. Constantine had mixed reviews along with Scanner Darkly, which was a brand new way of filming and then he came out with two disappointing films which were Generation Um... and Henry's Crime. Recently he has turned to action movies like Man Tai Chi, which he directed, 47 Ronin and, of course, this movie, which he plans to star in a sequel. In total, his movies have grossed nearly $3Billion so he has had a impressive career to date. He's never been comfortable around the whole Hollywood scene but he has proved to be a bankable star, even though he doesn't like to admit it. Anyway, this film was directed by Chad Stahelski whose done the stunts in over 70 movies which include Point Break, the Matrix trilogy, Spiderman 2, Die Hard 4, Rambo, X Men, Iron Man 2, the Expendables, Tron Legacy, Sherlock Holmes and the Hunger Games so he really does have a impressive portfolio when it comes to stunt coordinating. This is his first movie in the directing chair and after its success, he plans direct the sequel, hopefully with a meaningful storyline. Anyway, for his first project, I was quite impressed with the result and I can't wait to see John Wick causing more havoc again.Budget: $20million Worldwide Gross: $79millionI recommend this movie to people who are into their action/thrillers about a ex-assassin who seeks revenge after Russian gangsters kill his dog and steal his car. 6/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"

An Entertaining Revenge Film,"Ah, the revenge film. Is it possible not to root for a masochistic protagonist who feels the need to slaughter the people who did them wrong? Whether it involves Uma Thurman slashing Lucy Liu, Vivica Fox, and an odd assortment of Japanese bodyguards or Lee Marvin thirsty for retribution after being left for dead, there is something lip-smackingly satisfying about seeing a badass make fair and square with all the wrong people.""John Wick"" is as much a comeback vehicle for Keanu Reeves as it is a sumptuously shot throwback to the days of Charles Bronson and Sylvester Stallone. The film doesn't necessarily update what we've come to know about the revenge movie over the years — it, instead, provides for a refreshing take on a subgenre that, in a world accustomed to Liam Neeson threatening kidnap happy terrorists, has gotten a bit dusty. Here is a movie that knows it's predictable, but is smart enough to understand that going through the motions just won't do this time around. Like the ""Kill Bills"" before it, everything is so stylistically visceral that we hardly have time to roll our eyes and remember that the hero always finds the fulfillment they're looking for. We have to sit back and enjoy the blood soaked ride.Reeves, after years away from the action scene, portrays Wick as a man wounded by his past. He was a hit-man years ago, but left the scene in pursuit of a blissful marriage. As the film opens, however, his wife has, as it seems, died of a serious illness (which is never explained). Damaged assassins are never a good thing, and after his grieving process is interrupted by a gaggle of Russian thugs who steal his car and kill his dog, something in Wick snaps. He goes from loving husband to murder machine in a matter of seconds, and so the film goes on autopilot, but not in the ways you might expect.The plot feels very been there, done that, and Reeves, who I've always labeled as the most wooden leading man in Hollywood, goes through the motions without a single ounce of emotion to back him up. (Even in a scene where he breaks down, we are hardly convinced he looks anything other than a circa 2009 Kristen Stewart's father.) Somehow, though, ""John Wick"" doesn't seem to be about plot, or Reeves, for that matter: rather, we are intent on how the plot is executed, how the action set pieces set themselves apart from the other thrill heavy movies of the decade or, cough cough, ""The Matrix"". And, for the most part, we are presented with an entertaining revenge movie, one who takes its gun fu very seriously and one who just finds violence artistic as long as it's done right. Chad Stahelski, making his directorial debut here, is confident in his every move, making ""John Wick""'s sleek thrills pack more punches than your average pulpy exercise in madness.This is a well-made movie, no doubt, but I'm not so sure it presents us with anything new. It's all been done before (though here it's quite a bit more stylish, obsessing itself with a Michael Mann reminiscent tinting process) and it's been done better. But maybe I'm just cynical because ""Kill Bill"" is close to being the best thing ever, and no revenge film can ever come close to its greatness. It's hard to get over your first love, after all.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
"good, but the second is the best","John wick was presented in an extraordinary way, a new iconic and unique character in the film genre that I like most about the action. The action scenes are absolutely amazing, as is the history and development of each character. I scored less for the level of action scenes, but as John Wick is the best trilogy of action movies I've ever seen since rambo or 80s and 90s classics.

Hit-man and his dog,"John Wick is an action film with video game type shooting scenes but a somewhat barmy plotting. Keanu Reeves makes it watchable despite the script.John Wick is newly widowed and his late wife gifted him a puppy which has been killed by the wayward son of a Russian mobster who has also stolen his car. However it is soon revealed that Wick is an ace hit-man and now he is back to get revenge and get his car back.This means various shooting and fight scenes. Wick is the man who the mob would call to kill the boogeyman. Yet we have scenes where minnows are easily dispensed with but the alpha male somehow survives.There is a female hit-woman out to get Wick and somehow he leaves her alone to cause further mischief. The Russian Mobster whose son Wick wants to kill is also let go by him when you would have thought it would had been better to shoot him fast.It is entertaining schlock, the plot is full of holes. Reeves acting is not stretched, he is required to be mean and moody, say a few words and do a lot of shooting.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
One of the best action movie I've ever seen.,"This movie was excellent. I love action movies and this movie has everything to be a great action. The story is very nice, the acting is great, the fighting and shooting scenes are great and everything else is very good. The story was easy to understand. Memorable characters and Keanu Reeves was just plain Awesome! There are a lot of new faces in this movie which would make me feel it's good, but the actors have all put their best in to this film and you can see it on screen. I have seen so many films that just don't capture the viewers eye, this movie keeps the viewer glued to the screen in till the end. Keanu was a great choice for this role, he plays a hit-man with ease, but there is always a little spark which he puts into his acting which makes him stand out from the crowd. He is perfect in this film. This is the type of movie people will see over and over again. Waited in a long line to see it but it was well worth it. Amazing special effects, great acting, great everything. Best movie I have seen all year. Keanu Reeves is back after a long break and he is better than ever. This is like a combination of Speed and the Matrix combined. John Wick is the real deal. It is amazing action picture, filled with strong performances by a cast, along with superb action set-pieces and a genuinely interesting world to boot. Reeves commands the screen and reminds us why he is still a genuine movie star. Can't wait to see John Wick: Chapter 4 in 2021.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"

Everybody who wants a great thriller that is entertaining and stylistic from beginning to end.. this is your movie.

If you're looking for a smart movie, this is not it. But if you're looking for an expensive, flashy, studio-quality cinematic FPS, this is absolutely it.

The Vidiot Reviews...,"John WickThe ideal leisure pursuit for a retired hit-man is assisting retirement communities with their mercy killings.Mind you, the pensioner in this action movie is too busy with revenge killings.Following his wife's (Bridget Moynahan) funeral, former mob enforcer John Wick (Keanu Reeves) is accosted by Iosef (Alfie Allen), the son of his former boss Viggo (Michael Nyqvist), who kills his dog and steals his car.To protect his son from Wick's legendary wrath, Viggo puts a bounty on Wick's head that attracts the hit-man's contemporaries (Adrianne Palicki, Willem Dafoe) to the party.They, along with Viggo's other cronies, might just come close to matching Wick's lethalness.From stylized shootouts to choreographed hand-to-hand, this fresh take on the standard vengeance tale is relentless in it's delivery of kinetic violence, snappy dialogue and sad faces from Keanu.Incidentally, Wick's unwillingness to stay retired is why millennial hit-men can't get a job.Yellow Lightvidiotreviews.blogspot.ca",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"

"Stylish, loud, OTT and comic book like - this is action done right","While John Wick can quite literally be described as an endless parade of bullets and headshots (seriously, Mr. Wick just loves a good old fashioned headshot!) Chad Stahelski's stylish, loud, brash and unwaveringly violent opus of revenge is a highly watchable stock standard tale of a scorned man on a warpath that we've seen before, yet never seen quite like this.Front and center to this incredible body-dropping journey is dog lover and suit wearer John Wick, played by the thankfully watchable Keanu Reeves (almost like 47 Ronin was a bad dream). John is clearly a man who at one stage in his life utilized his skills of killing for a price and as per usual got out once love came his way. John is a man that even the ""bogeyman"" fears and a man who doesn't take kindly to having his puppy brutally murdered by a bunch of Russian thugs. The story of John Wick is slight and could've easily been written by a teenage boy whilst playing the latest Call of Duty but there's a market for these throwaway action flicks and up and coming director Stahelski clearly knows this.Directing the film like it's been injected with a drip feed of Red Bull, Stahelski barely stops to breathe in amongst the processions of finely tuned and impeccably crafted gun fights. From a home invasion firefight, a nightclub massacre and rain soaked battle at a port, Wick finds himself literally fighting across New York in increasingly OTT yet sufficiently satisfying gun battles. Stahelski cares little for trying to be realistic and the films tone is almost comical in its treatment of hotels for hit men and ""waste disposal"" crews and you get the feeling this film was aiming to be more John Woo than James Bond, which gives it an added sprinkling of charisma even though we all know Keanu Reeves isn't exactly the poster boy of emotional embodiment.If you don't like a liberal dosing of blood and a body count to match then John Wick is going to be a living, breathing nightmare for you, but for those looking for a well-oiled and at times almost fanciful rendition of the revenge tale then John Wick is going to be a new favourite of yours. A welcome return to form in many ways for Keanu Reeves and a calling card for director Stahelski, John Wick is under no illusions to what it is and neither should the viewer be when judging it. With a sequel already in the pipeline, it's pretty clear that John Wick did its job and hopefully can do it once more in the years to come.3 pencils out of 5For more movie reviews and opinions check into -www.jordanandeddie.wordpress.com",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
It was the opposite of enjoyment watching this movie,"I have watched probably close to a thousand movies in my time. Hardly ever have I seen one in which a major Hollywood actor has had to endure such a poorly produced crime drama as John Wick.It is a shame that an actor with the potential of Keanu Reeves has to work in such a meaningless film. I sure hope he does not go the way of Nicolas Cage, whose last good movie was made in 2003 (Matchstick Men). My fears though of a career collapse are slowly but surely being realized with Keanu as this makes a two-for-two terrible movies list (47 Ronin was in the category of WTF). I will have to watch Generation Um... and Man of Tai Chi to see what calibre of production Reeves has been partnered with of his last four films.As for the film itself, John Wick is a totally un-enjoyable movie not only because the plot line is yet another US State Department propaganda piece using Russians as the bad guys but because the audience is not given the tools to sympathize for any character, both ""bad"" and ""good"" alike.The aftertaste of John Wick is a dark, dreary monolithic crime drama revenge movie that elicits zero compassion, respect or other noble feelings and imparts not one lesson of humanity to the audience. It does its job though of leaving a dark impression of Russians and a vaguely justified negative thought-impression of that particular strain of people.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"

Keanu Reeves is back doing what he does best,"""People keep asking if I'm back and I haven't really had an answer, but yeah, I'm thinking I'm back.""John Wick is as predictable and formulaic as the other 99% of revenge action flicks out there, but what makes this stand out is how well the action scenes are choreographed and what a breath of fresh air it is to see the action take place without all the extreme close ups and fast edits which never allow you to enjoy them. John Wick was directed by two former stunt men, Chad Stahelski and David Leitch, who seem to have a grip at what they're doing because they don't take any of the fun away from the action scenes. Derek Solstad's screenplay is pretty straightforward. We are introduced to the main character, John, who is grieving over his recently dead wife. She leaves him a cute puppy which will help him during this grieving period, but a group of young Russian mobsters break into his home one night to steal his car and in the process they kill the dog. That brings John to his breaking point and we discover pretty soon that he is no common man. He was once a feared hit-man who later retired after meeting his wife. Now he is set on getting his revenge and the action begins. John is the typical hero we can route for and identify with for his loss, while the villains are ruthless and deserve to be punished. We've seen all this in almost every other revenge film, but what makes this one stand out and feel fresh is that the action scenes are stylized and energetic. So despite having a predictable plot you are entertained with some of the coolest action scenes of the year. This is no Raid 2, but it does get the job done. There is one particular action scene that takes place in a nightclub that is fantastically choreographed. These are the strongest moments of the film, but if you are looking for an original plot look elsewhere because this is very predictable. There are some interesting elements that Solstad introduces in this world where the mobsters have a series of codes and rues that they follow giving it sort of a video game vibe to it at times.In order for the action scenes to work for a film like this where they aren't cutting the scenes every second you need to have an actor who can pull them off. They found the right one with Keanu Reeves who definitely knows his stuff. He delivers in every action scene with some fantastic choreographed moves. The mobsters build him up as someone they fear and respect, and once you see him in action you believe it. He also delivers during the quiet moments as well despite not having the best dialogue to work with. He was made for these roles and delivers. The supporting cast is excellent as well. Alfie Allen (from the Games of Thrones series) is getting typed cast as the hateful villain who behaves like a child at times. His father is played by the excellent Michael Nyqvist, who John Wick used to work for. He knows his kid made a mistake but tries to protect him nonetheless putting a generous reward on John's head. Willem Dafoe, Lance Reddick, and Adrianne Palicki get some screen time as well and they were a lot of fun. The way everyone treated John when they realized he was back in business was also another nice touch that the directors made and help lighten the mood at times. This was an extremely entertaining film with some of the best action scenes of the year despite all of its predictability. Stahelski and Leitch succeeded in making this predictable story feel fresh and if you are a fan of Keanu Reeve's work you will not want to miss this.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
Surprisingly Entertaining,"Keanu Reeves is back!John Wick, what an unexpected surprise. I saw this film expecting your average Action flick. Lots of shooting, lots of stunts, the works; which John Wick delivers on. What I didn't expect was the beautiful way in which this film was made. Every shot from the first to the last is beautifully color graded and designed. The performances were outstanding from Keanu Reeves playing the humbled hero to Alfie Allen being very Theonish (Game of Thrones).Yes, the movie is a little bit cheesy with its ""Rambo: First Blood"" incentives, but it's a lot of fun.

John Wick's pursuit of solace and other things,"John Wick is the tale of an angry Keanu Reeves hunting the men that supposedly took everything from him.The film has a surprisingly strong start by relaying what happened to Mr. Wick to cause him so much distress. In a way it's a very clichéd story about a man seeking vengeance that has been done an uncountable number of times. However, when the action picks up it only slows down for cleanup(literally) and a little bit of exposition. One thing I will note is that this is probably Keanu Reeves's best performance in a long while(however you want to take that) he is actually capable of emoting for a few sparse moments throughout the film, but I digress. Unfortunately, he really can't carry the weight to make this an amazing film. This movie suffers from an often pretentious style that really tries to shove it in your face. The smooth, gentleman-like assassin world is interesting but when the film is done through and through you'll realize that there was so much potential wasted for the sake of clichéd theatrics and situations that were obviously contrived. The one thing that the creators did manage to do perfectly was the soundtrack, it always hit the ""badass"" note and felt appropriate. The fight scenes were mostly superb with Keanu moving swiftly like he dropped a few years, but a few(and trust me you'll know which ones) were way too ""hollywood"".If you're looking for an enjoyable action flick that isn't overly thoughtful(which is what I was in the mood for when I watched it) I'd recommend John Wick7/10-It's Average",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
"As long as you go in expecting a good action movie, I don't see how you can be disappointed","I think every movie needs to be graded on a scale of its potential.9/10; for what this movie is, it could hardly be better. Of course you shouldn't expect some deep thought provoking movie. This is action. It's like an action movie from the 80s or 90s - done better than any of them.Some things are done so amazing that I think are likely attributed to David Leitch and/or Chad Stahelski. Perhaps it's their stunt background that's really made them understand how these fights should look, and how people actually handle injury and gunshots that's severely lacking in most movies. There is no people taking a shot to the chest, flying back 50 feet, and croaking. There are not people standing around taking their turns on John Wick. Nope, people are double taped. Everyone is finished off with a shot to the heart or chest. John Wick is taking on multiple people at a time with them attacking him like you'd expect. This may offend some, but I'd say this movie makes even legendary movies like Ip Man look BAD. Yet, at the same time, John Wick seems completely human, as he should. There is this perfect balance of him just appearing to be the really good assassin that he is, without seeming to have super powers.The only reason it's not a 10/10 are a few shortcomings: Michael Nyqvist's acting falls short on occasion, in my opinion (and yes, Keanu's acting in this moving is actually really fantastic). I find it a little odd that John Wick isn't more often looking back over his shoulder to make sure there isn't something there(but the choreography gets more right than just about any movie I've seen). The skip-to-end opening scene that so many movies do now days is also here. Sometimes those are good, but in this case it was really pointless.

On the other hand, the script is pretty darn ridiculous to say the least. coupled by the poor acting chops of Keanu. You'd think that after over 20 years of movies he'd be a little better at it by now. The acting from the Russians with the exception of Michael, is even worse. One redeeming factor of this is that, although the script is bad. The general plot and story unfolds well, which gradually makes the movie more fulfilling.All in all, unlike most of the US action movies just being about a guy killing everyone and with a poor handled story and even worse script, John Wick only has one of those things.

Is it really fun to watch this superhero of a hit-man shoot 450 enemies coming against him as fools?Reeves makes a part that's dead serious and then you have Nyquists character thats more out of a comedy. It simply doesn't work out.Then you have Dafoes Marcus that signs on for a contract and then doesn't shoot Wick when he get the chance. And he doesn't shoot the other hit-man coming at Wick either.

It's Okay,"Huh? (in response to the ratings/review) After watching the movie yesterday, I liked it. But the glowing reviews is going a little too far. The character of Wick stems from every western you've seen the past. Lone character whose purpose in life is activated by a terrible tragedy and is slung into action amongst other people similar to him. Yeah, westerns aren't made. This is the closest to it. And it's very effective. And silly at points. And it's fun and definitely worth the watch. I only wonder how terrible the movie industry has become that this will probably set a new ""gold standard.""To be fair I felt the same way about ""Guardians of the Galaxy.""

OK...it's all about Reeves,"lack of logical and gangster regency made the 2014 all boring for the action lovers.'John Wick' has made it all washed up, reminded the old days of 'Scarface'. The first person shooting style movies are getting popular in the trend of Hollywood but scarcity of strong and ideological substance had made all those trying almost ridiculed. John Wick has the ability to meet the hunger of the action lovers created in 2014. Reeves seemed so perfect in this character that he made us constrained to think about his perfectness in the character. Screenplay is fluent, storytelling fashion will enchant you. limited span of story has made this film nonetheless better.

killing strangers,"John Wick is a triumphant return to action cinema for Keanu Reeves. I won't say any more than this or mention the other films in his career but I saw it this morning and had a great time. Reeves is brilliant in this film, which is about an infamous retired hit-man (one-man killing machine) who plunges back into the underworld in the pursuit of revenge. If you've seen the trailer the story is as simple as it appears: a pretext is to give Keanu the opportunity to be entertaining-as-hell as a gun-wielding bone-crunching badass. Luckily the magic works and a cheesy, tongue-in-cheek, actioner becomes a breathless explosion of Russian-hit men and mobsters. Yes, Russians are back on the menu. Why is this entertaining? Because it's Keanu, and he's back. No offense to Arnold but we all know who's cooler. The movie is superficial adrenaline-fueled fun and has the style and skill to keep you involved in the mayhem. Personally, I thought that there was just the right amount of everything. It doesn't avoid cheesiness but it doesn't matter when you're here to have fun. I'd like to make the point that the Russians portrayed in this film are purely fictional representations of mafia-members and I hold a deep respect for the dignity and integrity of the true Russian people.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"

WILL own on Blu-ray!,"OK, I'm biased. I'm big on Keanu. No homo. But j/king aside, John Wick is the movie that proves Reeves is still in the game. Ironically, the titular character is doing just what it's titular leading actor is supposedly doing; coming back and staying current. You only have to watch the movie 15 minutes to catch the tongue in cheek remarks thrown out ad nauseam to this.Keanu is all over this movie. I don't know how he manages to stay in-shape after 50; it's clearly himself doing most of the stunt work. He might just have the fountain of youth shoved somewhere in his body. (He is The One after all...) It's still good ol' stone face Keanu. Not as hammy as Keanu from Constantine, or as cold as Keanu from DtESS, but somewhere in between. The guy is all about subtlety and jest. He is forward, without being forward. I like it.Willem *ucking Dafoe!!! Is there any role this cat cannot play?! Seriously, you had me at Dafoe. I think Dafoe is competing with Freeman and Jackson for most utilized supporting actor in Hollywood. He's NEVER a main, always some BAMF supporting cast member. And as always, he's just too good not to love. Even in Fault in Our Stars, he was a lovable crass cynic, but in this movie, he's one of the characters who you just know is a true badass. Keanu ALWAYS picks characters who are loners, yet somehow attracts the guardian angel types, or people who just want him to win. This time around, Dafoe is Wick's guardian angel.Alfie Allen and Michael Nyqvist are the true breakout actors in this film. Allen, as we all know from Game of Thrones, is easy to hate, but hard to love. He plays this role much as he does in GoT by being the prick mob boss's spoiled brat son who has a penchant for not thinking two seconds ahead. And the mob boss, Nyqvist, is probably the best representation of a smarmy yet sophisticated Russian Don since... well he's probably the first really well adapted Russian mob boss we've ever seen! Jack Reacher went up against the Russian's, and I know there's some in Person of Interest, but Nyqvist's Viggo Tarasov has the swagger, brains, and even compassion to stay fresh and noteworthy, well after the film's ended. He's even got this breadth about him, a foreboding barrel chested strength that you don't see a lot of these days, good casting choice! Both actors played their respective wells true to form.I'd like to say more about other actors/characters in the movie, but it would honestly contain spoilers. You don't have to even watch the trailer to find out that this is a straight shoot 'em up, true to the core. The freaking dog dies, how much you wanna bet others will too...Read other reviews if you want to find out about plots, subplots and pacing. John Wick stays fresh and thrilling the entire way through!

The closest to this, was maybe Ronin from 1998. The camera work was phenomenal and dialog above passable.

"Entertaining, Stylish And Some Wickedly Awesome Actions","Keanu Reeves existence was almost an apparition or ilk in his acting career since the phenomenal Matrix series. Despite delivering some authentic roles in remarkable blockbusters the guy Neo as we know disappeared along with the Matrix a decade ago possibly into the depths of a Matrix itself. His chief contribution from the asylum was frequent mediocre roles that didn't do justice to his potentials and a load of tedious second-rate movies that we didn't see come and go; and yes, except one or two. Keanu is a good actor, a typecast action hero. He could have done a lot better, choose some notable characters or somebody could have saved this poor chap by giving him a role that he truly deserved. And finally it took director duos David Leitch and Chad Stahelski to become the saviors. Keanu is saved. Or in more apt words, Keanu is back. This is his best movie released since a long time.Ignore the aforesaid statements. Considering his movies of the past decade the 'Sad Keanu' Meme was totally legitimate.John Wick is a wickedly entertaining 100 minutes of exhilarating marathon killing spree show that will make your butt go flabbergasted; with comparatively less elaborated plot and forthright twists. It doesn't have an impressive story arc to brag about but a straightforward account of a retired hit-man seeking vengeance for the killing of his beloved dog. And boy does he seek that out with style and elegance. It also features an awesome soundtrack.The quirk about the movie is its action and in its execution. And the fight sequences are likely to be one of the all-time best in films. Keanu Reeves literally invokes the phantom of some dead martial art legend to make your limbs uncomfortable doing nothing. He is said to have undergone four months of learning judo and some nutcracker techniques developing special close-quarter combat style and wicked skills. And does it reflect throughout the movie. John Wick is mostly about the remarkable style of action. Its approach toward the assassins and their cult offers some rather exciting insights into how do they pull off the jobs and how things work in their terms and conditions.I'm not a big fan of action movies. The one reason I discount most of those movies is due to their unconvincing and improbable outlook of a superhuman hero to whom logic and physics doesn't apply. John Wick on the other hand boasts not about the impossible and implausible abilities a man on vengeance is capable of fostering. The character John Wick is portrayed as a highly skilled assassin; someone who was in the business for a long enough time to master his moves. There is no fancy action movie cliché like bullet repelling body, instant recovery, flying off of buildings or the insane jumps.The crispy combat style and background music pumps some impressive energy into the action; John Wick is one of the best action flicks I had seen. There isn't a solid story or a clash of brains but if you are fan of action movies or looking to watch something for fun and get pumped up, then there isn't a better entertaining action flick released in the recent years than John Wick.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"

nice one,"""John Wick"" emerges as a stylish and action-packed thrill ride, propelled by Keanu Reeves's charismatic performance as the titular assassin seeking vengeance. The film editing maintains a tight and kinetic pace, seamlessly blending intense fight choreography with a straightforward narrative. While the music sets the mood for the relentless action, it may not be a standout element. The film's strength lies in its unapologetic dedication to well-executed action sequences and world-building within the criminal underworld. However, the weakness lies in a somewhat predictable plot that, while serviceable, doesn't add much depth to the genre. The cinematography captures the neon-soaked, atmospheric landscapes of a gritty underworld, providing a visually striking backdrop for John Wick's relentless pursuit. With a 6/10 rating, ""John Wick"" delivers on the promise of action-packed entertainment, even if it doesn't quite transcend the conventions of the genre.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
Astonishingly good. Stunning cinema.,"Reeves is back to his Point Break, Speed, Matrix action-best. Wick a violent, visceral fast-paced high kill-rate film with a vintage slick and eminently cool feel to it. Reeves owns the screen, and reveals a physicality which belies his age. He throws himself around and is believable as the suave professional 'mechanic' anti-hero.The story - I'll admit - is a little far-fetched if you take it too seriously, the bad guys are a little hammy and one-dimensional but Reeves brings a grace and gravitas to the role of Wick which shows off just how good he is. The martial arts are unusual, original and superbly choreographed and, like Jackie Chan, Wick uses anything to hand and is more fragile and realistic than most action anti-heroes, he is breakable and you believe he might just not make it. Cute puppy scenes, cuter puppy and Keanu scenes - is there anything better than a scene with a handsome man and a gorgeous puppy? The brutal scenes with the dog - Daisy - will upset some but bear with the film. It's quietness and lack of complex dialogue works well with Reeves and the story, there is a calm about him which is a juxtaposition to what he does for a living, is capable of, and this is depicted rather well with the unusual punky/rock soundtrack.Watch it. Probably a favourite for boys everywhere, martial arts fans, Keanu fans and definitely ladies that like guys with guns and an easy power that makes your knees wobble. It is a stunningly shot film... an old school feel, slick, and dark and totally entertaining.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
HOT LEAD and cute dog,"If there's a modern movie that better exemplifies the 80s action movie, I don't think I've come across it. The plot doesn't really have twists, and there are basically no subplots to speak of; it's just a straight line from beginning to finish. Reeves plays the titular retired hitman who's just lost his wife (to cancer) but who receives a beagle as a final present from her, delivered after her death. He has the dog for like two days before Russian mobsters invade his house to steal his vintage Mustang and kill the dog just for kicks. And thus the most plausible revenge plot in history is set into motion. There's a LOT of violence. A lot of characters die. Some of the action is very reminiscent of The Matrix. The weaponry is impressive, as is the hand-to-hand combat. There's a lot to love about John Wick the movie, as long as you're part of the intended audience, i.e., the action-movie fan.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"

He shows his vulnerability by getting in trouble and pays dearly for it.However, there is a considerable amount of humour included with the violence in John Wick and enough new ideas, such as the use of gold coins, to keep the movie fresh throughout.This is a good deal: excellent action, fun, no shaky-cam and acting, even though Keanu is still deadpan.

"I thought that it would get on my Wick, but it didn't!","John Wick (2014) -I was pleasantly surprised by this one. I hadn't expected much and after the first death I wasn't sure that I was going to like it at all.Keanu has never been an actor that I've ever regarded that highly. He always seems to be playing a permanently stoned teenager, which doesn't really translate to being an action hero and it's good that he doesn't say much here, because I think that's when he gives his best performances.However he was surprisingly good and the action fighter guy thing suited him. Other than Ted 'Theodore' Logan I think that this is probably his best role.I don't know why, but I also appreciated Michael Nyqvist in his role, he seemed quite effortless.And Ian McShane's cameo was enjoyable too, an interesting character that I hope reappears in the next two films.The dog was very cute as well, so the bad guys deserved everything they got.I liked the fight sequences and how the film was all put together. There was obviously some thought put in to the editing and story boarding in the first place and I liked the music that was appropriately used too. It worked really well to accompany a fairly rock and roll film.I also liked that it wasn't very long. It utilised a simple revenge storyline, that didn't need hours to explain and without it getting bogged down in complicated twists and turns and too much of the ""Whose side are they on"" idea.Overall a fun action film with an ease that so many others lack.666.77/1000.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"

It's really easy in these kinds of films for the action scenes to be hard to follow, but these are great. No surprise this crew were associated with The Matrix, whose action scenes were similarly clean.A few nice little surprises, but not enough of them.Bad (spoilers here):Oh lord, the clichés. First, the entire premise: badass hit-man forced out of retirement to avenge a wrong done to him. Russian mob boss with brash dumbass son. Obligatory stash of weapons and money sealed under concrete floor. Old friend who appears to have turned on our hero but saves his bacon at a couple of crucial moments. Climactic fight with the main bad guy in which they toss aside their guns and fight hand to hand.That wrong done to him? Killing his dog and stealing his car. Seriously? I get the sentiment behind the dog and his dead wife and all, but still I was reminded of the bit in Last Action Hero about how they killed his favorite second cousin or whatever.If this was the first movie you'd ever seen in this genre, it would be totally amazing. As it is, I kept seeing a lot of things I'd seen before and not enough things that I hadn't.

There are inconsistencies in his ability and it does stretch credibility that he can take severe beatings that then have no affect or even markings on him, but this is more of a cartoonish action movie than one you watch for realism.

John Wick easily trounces The Equalizer,"""John Wick"" has a lot in common with ""The Equalizer"" (2013). Both feature a former highly skilled assassin who has retired to live in quiet solitude but who is compelled to use his deadly skills again when a Russian mobster commits a despicable act of violence. Denzel Washington is generally considered the better actor and brings a sense of gravitas to his role. However, Keanu Reeves brings more a sense of melancholy and reluctance to his role, which was sadly lacking in TE. Washington looks bigger, stronger and more physically imposing, but never displays any particular skill at martial arts. The fights in TE are shot in semi-darkness and edited with a lot of quick cuts, so Washington's character never seems truly credible as the tough fighter he is supposed to be. In contrast, the fight scenes in JW are masterfully choreographed. One can not only see, but follow the action. Reeves comes across as a much more credible action hero, skilled with guns, knives and his bare hands. The Russian mobsters are much more menacing, evil and capable in TE than in JW, where they are adequate, but less memorable. These gangsters are three-dimensional characters with flaws, foibles and idiosyncrasies that make them more realistic and even a little likable. They also have conflicting agendas, whereas the gangsters in TE are more narrowly focused and unwavering. JW also has a much better production design. The color palate, costumes and cinematography blow TE away. Neither film is perfect. JW starts off a bit slowly attempting to bolster motivations that don't need bolstering. But once it begins, maintains a steady action pace. Between the two, JW is much more enjoyable and Reeves is a better action hero than Washington. JW doesn't have quite the panache or complexity of ""Django Unchained,"" ""Rock 'n' Rolla,"" ""Smokin' Aces"" or the underrated ""Lucky Number Slevin,"" but it's a solid effort by all involved.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"

This all culminates in a terrific speech that confidently announces the return of one of Hollywood's best and nicest leading men.There's also a strong supporting cast here too. Willem Dafoe is effortlessly cool with an understated friendship with Reeves. Michael Nyqvist does an amazing job at showing the fear that John Wick instils in people. Finally, there's Ian McShane and John Leguizamo who are instantly likeable in their small roles.Chad Stahelski's direction is phenomenal, it puts most other Hollywood action films to shame with its endlessly impressive and always comprehensible action. It's also extremely stylish with fight scenes drenched in neon and rainfall.The music by Joel J.

The cinematography and style is so beautiful and different from other action films, which makes it a unique and fresh breath into the genre. The film is also filled with stunning performances from Reeves and the compelling antagonist - even a surprise performance from Willem Dafoe.One thing I noticed during the action, is the fact that the kamera-work has shy completely away from ""shaky-cam"", which is much harder to achieve and so pleasant to look at. It makes the action more tangible and easy to follow.Even though the plot is not really a new thing, it's unveiled and structured with such grace, that the only critique - is the simplicity of it all. But overall a really satisfying action-flick, that clearly blew me away.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
Long live the man of Action,"I grew up watching movies with alpha males doing what alpha males do. whether it was the 60's with John Wayne, Lee Marvin, Sean Connery and Steve Mcqueen. The 70's with Clint Eastwood, Charles Bronson, Roger Moore, Gene Hackman and Burt Reynolds. Or the 80's with Chuck Norris, Sylvester Stalone, Steven Segal, Arnold Scwarzeneggar, Bruce Willis, Mel Gibson and Van Damn. Something happened in the 90's with regards to the action genre, and Keanu Reeves was the only actor from that time forward who ever seemed to keep the tradition going, I liked Speed, the Matrix better and John Wick best of all. Reeves like all the names I mentioned get's guff for not being a ""Serious Actor"". My retort..who cares? While hold overs from early years like Willis, Segal, Gibson Van Damn and stalone continued making descent action flicks after the 90's. Reeves is the only actor I can think who basically came on the scene in the 90's who stayed true to his roots and is single handily keeping this genre alive.John Wick is a dark film that reminds me of Blade Runner, Dark City, and From Hell with regards to production, only the lens filter used in this movie was so dark it almost becomes distracting. (this is not the only recent film I can think of that has this problem) Aside from this one technical problem, the movie was perfect. While not as gritty as Able Ferrera's Fear City or as comic book as The Payback from the 90's it seems to meet in the middle of these two films somewhere. The action scenes are some of the best ever put to film, the soundtrack animates the movie as much as the fight sequences, and it has absolutely Zero political correctness factor to it which is so refreshing. I liked this movie a lot. Long love the man of action.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
"You have to crawl before you can run, or so I´ve heard","You have to crawl before you can walk, or so I´ve heard of the franchise. I have only seen the first John Wick movie and I´ve heard it only gets better from here or so you would hope so. I think John Wick is an influential action movie in the modern era. It started to challenge the terrible action in the 00´s and demanded more from what we expected a good action flick to do. It dared to stay in the action, dared to not cut all the time, dared to actually have a choreography and for that you have to be grateful of this movie. Is it perfect? Not at all, it´s a pretty cookie cutter movie, but what it set in the sea for the future of action is great and overall, you have a fun concept movie that no doubt will entertain you.After being attacked in his own home and having his life taken from him the hitman John Wick comes out of retirement to seek revenge.What this movie does best is it´s action. The different set pieces and execution is so thrilling and brutal. It reminds me of the old Hong Kong cinema with guns now. The idea of ""gun-fu"" comes to mind here. The primarily way of killing is these one-shot, one kill mentality that is so satisfying to see. Top that with an incredible choreography and you have a just stunning action movie. This movie doesn't cut all the time or has a lot of shaking camera, to hide the troubles' of shooting action, but dares to stay with the characters and not move. I think you can cut in an action scene; I think you can use a less stable camera to have effective action sequences, but this movie showed us in a modern setting the satisfaction of having these still cameras and long takes to have the most satisfying action sequences. Having a movie challenge a new norm is always incredible. Coming of just watching Kick-Ass (2010) that did not have the greatest action but from a director that also is going to produce incredible action later in his carrier, really makes you appreciate a just good action sequence.I have heard some critique about John Wick in terms of the movie going on longer than it needed to. Not really the runtime, but that John Wick the character is hyped so much up to be this unstoppable killing machine that it´s insane he gets' some stormtrooper aim and get´s overpowered a lot. The movie explains it away with him being rusty, but I also like the explanation that not all hitmen are specialized in everything. I see Wick as a close combat fighter and whenever he misses his target in the middle of the movie, they are always moving and further away, we see his more up close and personal with knifes and guns and having a character showing a different skill, Marcus, makes me think there is some merit to it, this theory is a bit botched later in the movie though but I still like to think there is some truth to it, maybe later movies are going to prove me wrong.The other aspect this movie does great is establishing lore without over explaining it. The continental and the hitman order is not overexplained and have a million lines dedicated to it, you just have to pick up context clues and build the rest of the world up yourself. The relationships and characters are all so well written because they have so much story to them without actually showing any, you can easily imagen how these people see John Wick, the hitman order, how the villain is, what happened in the past. It´s all greatly set up subtext that isn´t affecting the story in the best way possible, not wasting your time with too much chit chat and just going for a pure action experience.Sadly, the acting isn´t the best here, it can sometimes feel like too much of a cliché action movie in the best and worst way possible. The dialogue is cringe at times and there is not really any actor pulling off their characters a 100% This really hurts the overall experience in my opinion. Top that with some really over the top scenes and effects and you have a movie trying too hard at times. Keep it low key and you got it, trying to overdramatize and you have a bit of a weaker movie.I actually liked the score and soundtrack, even though it could be a bit on the nose and cliché at times. Overall, it works for the movie but just fades into some background noise and generic action flick music.This story is very cookie cutter and that helps it and hurts it. The movie can feel like it´s a bit too many empty calories since it´s nothing more than a simple revenge plot, a few fun interactions in between the next action set piece. The story and characters aren´t really that important, same with the overall relationships and characteristics of the characters, which weakens the impact of the movie to me. I just needed a bit more to really make it hit home.But overall, the impact this movie had on the action genre is great since it challenged the generic weak action slock that was dominating the 00´s. An era where you didn't have to try in terms of action, since no one really seemed to care too much. Now people expected a bit more from their action movies, they expected to go back to an era of stunts and practical care, where some sense of reality is actually a part of the movie. Sets have to be built, choreographies have to be learned and cameras have to be stable and dare to stay with the action. This is only a great thing this movie did!John Wick is a movie I really like but will never find amazing. I think it´s impact, action and overall concept is phenomenal, but everything else lessens the impact and make the movie a bit too generic. While it´s special in so many other ways, it falls into some classic action movie traps, that lessens the impact it was supposed to have.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
Gratuitous violence start to finish...nothing more,"I find nothing 'stylish' about gratuitous violence start to finish. And Rotten Tomatoes gives it an 85?? What is the world coming to? Seriously!! And so much for the 'crisp' gun-fu. During one scene I saw a flash from his gun, but only heard a click and no bang!

"Revenge. puppies, and a lot of dead bodies","It seems a lot of people that have written a bad review of this movie were expecting a completely different dramatic movie. If you do like action flicks with great fight scenes, a believable plot and a believable story line then give this a go. Honestly, it's Bourne Identity fight scenes, with COD shooting, a little comic book feel thats mixed with some great cinematography, and a whole lot of killing. The movie is straight bad ass, no over developed characters taking time away from mayhem, no stupid happy love story, and no sub plots or other bull crap. Keanu is great in this role, Dafoe is awesome, Leguizamo is short and to the point and Dean Winters is great as well. This isn't Citizen Kane, thank god, its an action movie, plain and simple..... guns, death, ass kicking!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
JOHN WICK,"John Wick is one of the best action-pack film of the year. Keanu Reeves is at his best since The Matrix. ""Lots of Action"", ""Badass"" ""Incredible Story"" and "" An Unforgettable Thrill Ride"" and this is why you go to the movies, with the Best Action Movie of 2014",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
Fun and Dumb,"I was hoping that Keanu Reeves would resurrect his career with 47 Ronin, a remarkably boring film with some interesting CGI. Here comes John Wick, from marketing to execution, a bare-bones action flick that leaves nothing to be desired except a better plot. Reeves' titular character is a retired hit man who is unwittingly robbed by the son of a Russian mob boss. In the process, John Wick's puppy is killed. The puppy was a gift from his dead wife who died of cancer days before. Apparently, John Wick feels he has nothing left to lose. John Wick is determined to destroy the man who killed his puppy, no matter how many Russian mobsters must die in the process. And boy, do they die! In terms of action/adventure, special effects, etc. this film is an example of doing more with less. The action scenes had none of that CGI music video feel; they were all realistically choreographed and shot, which helps a lot with the suspension of disbelief. The performances are about as good as the script will allow, but nothing stands up to scrutiny. With John Wick being as unstoppable as he appears to be, it's odd that he would have been the hapless victim of a home invasion. And why, why won't we listen to reason? As the film is aware, ""it was just an f-ing dog.'",,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
A perfect role for Keanu Reeves.,John Wick is a fun action spectacle with a pulse-pounding score that is smart enough to cast an actor against type who is committed completely to this abusive insanity.,6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
John Wick is about as much of a badass action hero character as I've seen in a film!,"'JOHN WICK': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)Shoot-'em-up action flick starring Keanu Reeves as an ex-hit-man who comes out of retirement to avenge his dead dog. It was directed by first time feature filmmakers David Leitch and Chad Stahelski (former stuntmen and fight coordinators) and written by Derek Kolstad. The film also stars Michael Nyqvist, Alfie Allen, Dean Winters, Adrianne Palicki, Ian McShane, John Leguizamo and Willem Dafoe. It's a pretty cool and stylized action flick that's also a great comeback for Keanu Reeves.Reeves plays John Wick; a former hit-man who retired when his wife, Helen (Bridget Moynahan), became deathly ill with cancer. As he's grieving he receives a posthumous gift from her, in the form of a puppy named Daisy. It's explained, through a letter from Helen, that she wanted John to have the dog to help him cope with her passing. John quickly becomes attached to Daisy; so when Russian gang members break into his house and kill the dog, as well as steal his '69 Mustang, John decides to come out of retirement to get revenge. Nyqvist plays the father of one of the gang members, as well as John's former employer.John Wick is about as much of a badass action hero character as I've seen in a film and Reeves is great in the role. I think Reeves has gotten much better, as an actor, overtime; probably especially because his career took a pretty big downward turn recently. It's great to see him back in action and cooler than ever. I think filmmakers will do a lot more with this character as well, he's already a part of the video game 'Payday 2', and a film franchise seems very likely. The movie is also a great showcase for Leitch and Stahelski, as directors, and I can't wait to see more from them too.

"Not profound, not Shakespeare... but kinetic fun","This movie would never win a screenplay Oscar, but that's almost not the point here. This is a B movie, with choreographed fight scenes galore - and if you take it on it's own terms, it's kind of fun.It actually makes a nice change from Marvel and DC antics, where CGI seems to be always the king or queen. Here, there's old school beat em up, Hong Kong kung fu inspired cinema back on the screen again. It's almost a throw back to 80s and before fight flicks in this way.A simple revenge theme drives the film, and it suits Keanu's brooding persona well. The movie gets some decent acting chops from Alfie Allen and the late Michael Nyqvist, and a sly Willem Defoe, in fleshing out otherwise simply drawn and thinly written characters. Watch out also for a key character from 'The Wire' in a quietly scene stealing turn, whenever they're on screen.If you're looking for docu drama, and high realism, then take a pass. if you put the brain on 'get this' mode though for an old school pop corn fight flick, John Wick is definitely an entertaining few hours.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
One of the best action movies in years,"Whilst the plot of this action movie was no different from many revenge films, the pure violence and gore in John Wick combined with the intense and fantastically choreographed fight scenes left me open-mouthed and full of adrenaline!

Keanu Reeves plays his second best character after Neo in The Matrix,"After a while, Keanu Reeves returned in this film with a role that is undoubtedly at the level of his role in The Matrix. He now as a deadly assassin who wanted to continue with his life as a normal person until something happens that forces him to do the only thing he knows how to do best. John Wick is a deadly character not to be messed with and Keanu embodies him perfectly. He has a short and simple story, but gets to the point with good action scenes. A pretty cool crime movie that brought Keanu back as a great action icon. It's quite an entertaining movie that boasts convincing performances and a good soundtrack. John Wick is a simple action movie that fulfills its goal of entertaining the viewer and it was only the beginning of a new great opportunity for Keanu in action cinema. My rating for this movie is 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
