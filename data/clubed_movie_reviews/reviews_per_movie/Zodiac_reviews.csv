Not Your Average Serial Killer Movie (And That's a Good Thing),"""Zodiac"" may frustrate viewers who come to David Fincher's latest film expecting a traditional serial killer thriller. The film begins with a couple of hair-raising and rather brutal recreations of murders carried out by the mysterious killer who terrorized the San Francisco Bay area in the late 1960s and early 1970s. These early scenes are shocking and, compared to the rest of the film, disorienting, because they offer the only time that we come close to seeing events from the killer's perspective. As the film progresses, the Zodiac killer himself fades into the background, and the movie turns into a meticulous and engrossing document of the investigation to track him down, an investigation that includes countless blind alleys and false clues and which to this day has not reached a conclusion. I would be more prone to label the somewhat rambling screenplay as sloppy storytelling if I did not feel that Fincher tells the story exactly as he wants to. The elusive narrative works, because the film is about an elusive villain.Jake Gyllenhaal plays Robert Graysmith, a cartoonist working for the ""San Francisco Chronicle"" at the time the Zodiac killer began his gruesome work. He becomes fascinated by the case, and takes it on as a sort of morbid personal hobby long after the police department has given it up as a lost cause. Graysmith eventually wrote the book on which this film is based, and according to his accounts, he discovered enough evidence about one of the suspects in the case to put the police back on his trail years after he'd been cleared for lack of evidence. Other characters come and go. Robert Downey, Jr. does characteristically terrific work as a reporter at the ""Chronicle"" who grabs his own portion of notoriety through his involvement in the case. Mark Ruffalo and Anthony Edwards play the two detectives in charge of the investigation. Chloe Sevigny plays Gyllenhaal's put-upon wife, who gradually loses her husband to his obsession. All of the actors deliver thrilling performances, many of them against the odds. Since this isn't a character driven movie, many of the characters remain undeveloped, but not, for once, to the detriment of the film. This story isn't about the people involved, but rather about their role in the Zodiac saga; once they've served their purpose, Fincher dispenses with them. Ironically, a film that clocks in at nearly 3 hours exhibits a great deal of narrative economy.Parts of ""Zodiac"" are intensely creepy. Fincher effectively uses the rainy San Francisco atmosphere to its maximum potential, and the grimy browns and grays of the production design call to mind Fincher's other well-known films, like ""Seven"" and ""Fight Club."" But ""Zodiac"" is much more grown up than those films, and for an audience to enjoy it, it has to have an attention span. Long scenes are given to analyzing handwriting samples, recreating the scenes of murders, digging through newspaper clippings and files. You can tell that Fincher is fascinated by police work in the pre-CSI era, when fax machines were still a novel invention. He delves into the investigative process with a nearly fetishistic attention to detail, but he makes all of it endlessly mesmerizing. He does his best to bring everything to some sort of conclusion, but the real-life end to the story makes a complete conclusion impossible. This film is more about the journey than the destination, and what a journey it is.Grade: A",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
immersive and detailed,"On July 4, 1969, a killer shoots a couple on lovers' lane in Vallejo, California. The boy survives. The San Francisco Chronicle receives a letter from the Zodiac killer to print his letters with symbols. Reporter Paul Avery (Robert Downey, Jr) is on the case with the help of eager cartoonist Robert Graysmith (Jake Gyllenhaal). The brutal murders continue moving to San Francisco. San Francisco police detectives Dave Toschi (Mark Ruffalo) and William Armstrong (Anthony Edwards) are given the case. Other police include Jack Mulanax (Elias Koteas) in Vallejo and Detective Ken Narlow (Donal Logue) in Napa. Defense lawyer Melvin Belli (Brian Cox) appearing on TV gets a call from the supposed killer.This starts off as an interesting serial killer mystery. The attacks are horrifically shown. The couple forced to be tied up and stabbed is probably the most memorable. However the movie turns into something deeper. This is not another serial killer movie like the endless TV shows that populate modern networks. It may not even be about the central characters. This is an immersive experience living with the serial killer always on the mind. The Zodiac killer is just out there in this world. It's fascinating in its dark undertones and the lack of flashiness.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
"Good, but not what you'd expect","Usually when a film gets made about a media grabbing unsolved crime, the resulting movie tends to be overtly sensational and at best remotely connected to what really happened. Considering that director David Fincher's last film about a serial killer was the gripping but deeply disturbing Se7en, his take on the Zodiac killer almost seemed primed to be an extreme, nail-biting thriller.Instead what he's given us is a well argued thesis on the possible identity of the Zodiac. While there are some very intense scenes, Fincher takes a somewhat unexpected approach on the subject. All of the killings take place pretty early on in the movie, with the bulk of the story centering on the actual investigation into the killer by both the cops and a cartoonist who becomes obsessed with the case. In fact, the depictions of the murders are done in a manner that is fairly reverent towards the victims while still conveying the cruelty of them.Some people may find themselves disappointed by this two and a half hour epic if they go in expecting the usual serial killer fare. But it's a must see for any fan of Fincher's work, or anybody who likes a good detective story.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
The World Doesn't Work That Way!,"This is a movie about process. It's about what happens when a case goes cold and simple answers don't suffice. It's a risk taken when one does a fictional presentation of an historical event from fairly recent times. You can stick tot he facts or simply make things up. I enjoyed this film because the three principle characters were real and human. All were in over their heads to some extent. Jake Gyllenhaal character makes that sometimes unfortunate serendipitous discovery and becomes obsessed. The police have done what they can, but without passion and this is what Gyllenhaal's character brings to the game. Unfortunately, so much time has passed and so much has gone cold. So everything is based on circumstance. We must content ourselves with what we find and give up on confessions or witnesses. I knew from the start what the case was about and I recommend that those sourpusses that complain about this film do a little reading (maybe one paragraph on Wikipedia which should handle your attention spans) and then decide whether you want to bother with this. Personally, I thought the acting was superb and it painted a picture of the frustration with trying to solve a case with only bits and pieces.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
As interesting and as tedious as a thirty-year unsolved case,"*This comment may contain spoilers, but I tried to be as vague as possible, and I think that this movie actually improves if you more or less know the ending.*When David Fincher's ZODIAC opens with the year ""1969"" on the screen, a colorful wide angle shot of California, and a song from ""Hair"" on the soundtrack, we think we know what we are in for: an atmospheric historical epic. Then the film's first murder happens, and we are at the San Francisco chronicle with Jake Gyllenhall and Robert Downey, Jr., just recognizable enough under their period garb.We see three other murders or almost-murders within the first 1 1/2 hours of this 2 1/2 hour movie, and they are terrifying in a way that few movie murders are: this is one of the only movies that succeeds at making you identify with the victims, and the murder scenes contain enough gore to be convincing but not so much gore that it becomes its own aesthetic, as in other Fincher films.But ZODIAC is so long that eventually, the murders fail to keep our attention. The movie makes so many leaps through time and recounts so many investigations that lead nowhere, it is easy to forget that it began as an exciting movie.One could easily argue that the movie has a right to be so uneventful because it is a ""realistic"" reflection of police procedure and of, well, reality. It is, but one can't help but think, With all the time-lapsing that goes on (it constantly jumps months ahead in the late '60s and early '70s, and then jumps from '73 to '77 to '83 to '91), why couldn't it skip more boring parts? The movie manages to be both too truncated and too thorough.On a positive note, the digital cinematography by Harris Savides gives the film a consistently interesting look, which is something that many better movies don't have. He gives the film the signature ""Fincher"" look: saturated pastels in the daytime and a vague yellow-green tint at night. The movie is visually interesting without being calling too much attention to itself, but it's a shame that there's not enough to watch. The actors are sufficient, but the movie has no protagonist and we don't get to know anyone well enough - not even Robert Graysmith (Jake Gyllenhall), who becomes the de facto main character half way through.The friendship between Graysmith and Paul Avery (Robert Downey, Jr.) - particularly a bar scene in which Graysmith introduces Avery to the merits of girly drinks - is interesting enough, but when Avery ceases to be a major character, we don't get enough of an indication that Graysmith has a life outside of his obsession with the Zodiac case. That may have been the point, but it doesn't work: there is nothing wrong with a plot that goes nowhere if the characters manage to hold our interest, but they don't hold our interest for all 2 1/2 hours, and the movie itself seems to lose interest in Graysmith towards the end. ZODIAC has no pay-off, which wouldn't be a problem if it weren't such a plot-driven film.Still, it has its moments that nearly redeem it. It's a bit like a friend who tells long and meandering but enthusiastic stories: once you realize that his stories will always be too long, you can focus on the better parts. But his stories are still too long.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Terrific movie.,"Based on the wonderful novel, this film brilliantly tells the story of the unknown Zodiac killer, who operated in the late 60's and early 70's.You will easily lose a full night or afternoon with this movie, it's incredibly, it's engaging, dramatic, and captivating. I love how the time passes by on the film, everything changes accordingly, it's very well produced. At times it's very sinister, and creepy, but it's subtle, nothing is forced or heavy handed.The acting is terrific, Ruffalo and Downey are brilliant, a fresh faced Jake Gyllenhaal is arguably the one that steals the show.It really is a brilliant movie, I would recommend it highly. 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Using the Facts to Create a Pleasing Crime Thriller,"Zodiac, David Fincher's film about the impact the San Francisco Bay Area serial killer's case had on three primary characters is delivered with great attention to detail and proper pacing. Zodiac is not a film that uses or relies on suspended disbelief to succeed and does not attempt to compress five years of story into one in order to keep viewers interested. Instead it relies heavily on the facts and uses all of its 158 minutes to present them in almost linear form and staccato fashion.Set primarily in San Francisco in the late 1960's and 70's (and eventually the 80's) Fincher's Zodiac takes no artistic license by adding the obligatory car chase scene down Russian Hill, drug enhanced evening in Haight-Ashbury or conspiracy oriented behind the scenes moves by City Hall. Instead the audience is presented with a credible story that portrays how stress, tension, frustration and fascination play upon the lives of S. F. Police Inspector David Toschi (Mark Ruffalo), S.F. Chronicle Editorial Cartoonist Robert Graysmith (Jake Gyllenhall), and S.F. Chronicle reporter Paul Avery (Robert Downey Jr.). Each of these people, as well as those surrounding them are operating well within the confines of every day life and the establishment. Fincher does not let Zodiac wander outside its central story, and therefore no editorial comment about the Vietnam War or similar events of the day are offered. Insights about the impact on the victims (who survive) or their families are only touched upon if they remain central to the story.The initial scenes of the movie depict the killer in operation and they are not sugar coated. However, viewers wanting to see a film in the style of Fincher's Alien (3), Se7en or even Fight Club (i.e., blood and gore to almost surreal levels) should look elsewhere.Zodiac is a well crafted production on all fronts. In addition to Fincher, the lead actors and extensive (and well known) supporting cast Zodiac producer's assembled a credible team. James Vanderbilt (Screenplay), David Shire (Score), Donald Burt (Production Design), Keith Cunningham (Art Direction), Victor Zolfo (Set Direction) and Casey Storm (Costume Design) all deliver quality work in their respective areas. There are no weak spots in this film. Zodiac may not (or attempt to) dazzle, but it does please.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
"""This is the Zodiac speaking...""","I have been highly interested and engrossed in the Zodiac killer story for the last 5 years now and I can say, without doubt, that this is the best and most accurate telling of the story. The film presents numerous details that were unknown to me before seeing it. All of these facts and theories are thrown together in a way that strings the viewer along, you think it's someone, then you get new information and that person is no longer a suspect. Fincher really puts you into the life of a detective working on the case. You feel just as excited when new information comes about and are equally disappointed when it leads to another dead end.The film is beautifully shot (on VIPER digital cameras) and once again, Fincher shows us his wonderfully adept skills with CGI shots. All of the actors shine and truly become their characters. Jake Gyllenhall and Robert Downey Jr. put in excellent performances, as does Mark Ruffalo. I was also pleasantly surprised to see Phillip Baker Hall join the ensemble.The only complaint I have heard that holds any water is that the film is too long. At roughly 2 1/2 hours, I can see how many would think that is long, but you have to realize that this is an intricate story with deep characters who need to be examined and understood. A standard 90 minute film, or even a two hour cut, would not have been able to tell the story as well. Character motivation and important details would have been left on the cutting room floor.If you have followed the Zodiac case, you will be happy to see how well done this movie is. If you don't know anything about the case, you will be given an excellent story that will make you want to learn more about it. Regardless, you should do yourself a favor and see this movie. If nothing else, it's better than ""Wild Hogs"".",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Interesting story but 30 mins too long.,Engaging & suspenseful but it's too long - so it starts to drag around the midway point. I also think the ending is really anti-climatic - but then again I understand that it's based on a true story.,6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Class Act,"First up (and it's already been said)...this film is not going to appeal to the crash-bang- wallop-attention-span-of-a-bored-gnat brigade out there. Having read a lot of the reviews here, everyone seems to be divided in two. Love it...hate it. Which way will you go?Yes, it's long. But let's face it, this is not a film that can be wrapped up in an hour and a half. There's an awful lot of detail involved in this case. David Fincher was very thorough in his research and full marks to him. This is an excellent, compelling film for anyone interested in true crime and general detective work.I saw this film a few hours ago and was completely absorbed by it. The opening 4th of July sequence is worthy of the ticket price alone. And I challenge anyone to listen to ""Hurdy Gurdy Man"" by Donovan without a cold chill running down their spine after watching this...The main performances are excellent - Robert Downey Jr and Jake Gyllenhaal in particular are a standout. Any feminists out there won't be happy with the rather one-dimensional women's roles (and I happen to be female), but this is not what this film is about. It's about a handful of men's obsessive involvement with one case. And these men ARE utterly obsessed. And after so much taunting by the Zodiac with his letters and cyphers, who can blame them for their obsession?As for the depiction of the murders, they are quite shocking in their brief brutality with absolutely no glamorous or excessive lingering shots of the aftermath. This makes them infinitely more real and much more disturbing...Combine this with utterly believable dialogue, a superb soundtrack and marvellous production design and you have one classy movie. For all those tired of your average eye and brain-candy fodder...Go see. For those who can't appreciate a class act when you see it, you've missed out...",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
It's like The Usual Suspects.. without the plot twist..,"The film didn't finish its job properly, it takes you through 2 hours and 37 minutes of heavy police work only to slam you in the face with one of those text written ""they lived happily ever after"" endings.The movie is good, but ""good"" as in keeping the viewer occupied, yet it doesn't feed your inner detective or present you with a mind bending mystery, just a guy and a couple of cops going through evidence after evidence, they discover something.. it cancels something they've already assumed and so on.At first they show you ciphers and codes, you get excited thinking this will be a great mystery movie based on code breaking.. WRONG.. they skip that part pretty quickly.. next.. you see patterns in murders.. you think you'll see a thrilling chase on how they'll track the killer by figuring him out.. WRONG.. they focus on the most trivial aspects of a murder.. next.. they show you that the killer was challenging the police.. don't get any ideas.. WRONG!!! they've completely ignored everything relating to that..all the focus of the movie is oriented around finding his identity without examining evidence.. collecting as much circumstantial nonsense and making sense out of it..The movie fools you too often, for bad not good.. you expect something awesome only to be surprised by the exact opposite.. it has succeeded on many levels but has failed on most.. this isn't your typical Sherlock unveiling the truth movie.. just a fanatic obsessed with finding a killer.. 6/10 is a very generous score in my opinion..",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
The Stranger Urban Americans Fear: A Killer Playing the Most Dangerous Game,"The era in which Zodiac takes place bridges two eras in urban America. The Zodiac appeared on the tail end of a crime-spree that rampaged across the US in the late 1960's. His settling in the SF Bay Area may be one of a number of social phenomenons that pushed America's view of itself out of an innocent 1950's sensibility and into a harder and darker view that became more prevalent starting in the 1970's and into the 1980's. People, even in urban areas, used to be far more trusting of one another, friendly, and civil. Many of the events of the 1960's gave urban Americans a much more cynical and cautious attitude toward people they didn't know. Don't trust or talk to strangers. Better to sacrifice helpfulness than to wind up dead. People are out to take advantage. At least in urban areas nowadays, it seems, people are much less willing to take the risk to meeting someone they don't know, largely out of fear.The film Zodiac chronicles the strange unknowable and faceless figure that emerged as a serial killer in Northern California in the late 1960's and early 1970's. He sent letters to the San Francisco Chronicle and other newspapers, outlining his last and future kills, and he revealed he was inspired by the 1930's cult classic ""The Most Dangerous Game"". The point of view is largely from the side of the press with a character from SF Homicide that is also tracking the case. One character, Robert Graysmith (Jake Gyllenhaal) is an SF Chronicle cartoonist who at first takes an amateur's interest in the case, often bothering fellow beat journalist Paul Avery, played brilliantly by Robert Downey Jr. Only later does the cartoonist engage on his own investigation to reveal the identity of the Zodiac. When Graysmith begins receiving anonymous phone calls with nothing but heavy breathing, you can't help but wonder if he's also playing the same game, and if he may also become one of the hunted.One of the most brilliant aspects of the film is its pacing. It never lets up and the suspense is always there, which becomes unsettling when you realize that these events actually took place instead of purely in the imagination of a modern suspense novelist. There is an eeriness which pervades the entire film. A car stopping unexpectedly in a nearly-deserted area is more frightening than most scenes in your average low-budget slasher flicks.I do have a couple of shortcomings to this film. There are a couple of scenes where the cruelty and brutality of the violence is such that not all viewers will be able to handle this movie. I found I did have to turn away at a couple of scenes. Also, there are a couple of moments when the state of the investigation is not made clear. However, even given these shortcoming, Zodiac is a brilliant movie that tackles a subject-matter that probably could not have been brought to the screen during the period it depicts.The Zodiac came to personify one of the constant fears of living in urban America: a faceless, emotionless killer that comes out of the shadows of a dark alley to commit heinous violence. In the end, we fear strangers because of this, but we end up sacrificing love. It is an ironic aspect of human nature that people can do to strangers what would be almost unthinkable to do to people that we know. In addition to the poor innocent people that were brutally murdered, the Zodiac committed another crime against humanity. He compromised our sense of trust, civility, and in many ways, love for our fellow human beings even when we might not know them.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
"""Unraveling the Mystery""","David Fincher's ""Zodiac"" masterfully intertwines crime, history, and the obsession that ensues when a killer lurks in the shadows. Set in the late 1960s and 1970s, the film follows journalists and detectives as they attempt to identify the infamous Zodiac Killer, who taunted authorities and the public with cryptic letters and ciphers.One of the film's greatest strengths is its meticulous attention to detail. Fincher creates a dense atmosphere of dread and unease, effectively immersing viewers into the era and the relentless pursuit of truth. The cinematography is exceptional, featuring a muted color palette and haunting visuals that enhance the film's tension and intrigue.The performances are standout, particularly from Jake Gyllenhaal as Robert Graysmith, a cartoonist whose growing obsession with the case drives him to the brink. Gyllenhaal's portrayal captures the sheer determination and obsession that comes from digging too deep into the past. Supported by an impressive cast, including Robert Downey Jr. And Mark Ruffalo, the characters are well-developed, each representing different facets of inquiry and obsession.""Zodiac"" is not just a thriller; it is an exploration of the impact of unsolved mysteries on the human psyche. The film eschews traditional horror tropes, instead focusing on the eerie silence of the hunt and the frustration of the unknown. The pacing is deliberate, inviting viewers to ponder the ramifications of the investigation rather than relying on jump scares or overt violence.""Zodiac"" is a compelling dive into the world of true crime that stays with you long after the credits roll. It invites thoughtful discussion about the nature of obsession and the complexity of human morality. A must-watch for fans of meticulously crafted narratives and psychological depth, this film will have you pondering not just whodunit, but the very nature of truth itself.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Fincher's best? No. But still very good,"I am tired of people writing comments like this, ""Not Fincher's best"". Honestly who cares. We all agree that Fincher's best is either Seven or Fight Club, two outstanding masterpieces. There is a big margin between a film like one of those and a terrible film, and people don't seem to realize that. These people even do this with other filmmakers like Spielberg or Scorsese, the fact that these filmmakers don't reproduce Schindler's List or Raging Bull doesn't mean that their new stuff isn't good, or worth seeing. I think it is a stupid way to comment on a film, eliminating the critic's credibility. I was lucky enough to catch an advanced screening of Zodiac last night, and I must say that at first I was discouraged by two things, some of the comments I have read and the running time. However I am glad to say that I enjoyed this film, very much. It is a solid suspense thriller that pins you to your seat. Being a true story adds quite a lot to the experience, and besides, Fincher did a wonderful job is staying loyal to the story and at the same time adding his unique flavor to it. The cinematography, like every Fincher film, is great, the darkness and griddiness of the story are perfectly portrayed in the film's visual elements. I was surprised by the picture quality of the Viper, the digital camera with which this film was shot. Many people have been criticizing this choice, but I respect it, he is embracing a new technology and making it work. Of course its still not a match to 35 mm, but if quality filmmakers don't start experimenting with it, it will never be. Now the reason why this film falls behind Seven and Fight Club, I think, is because of a problem with the characters. They seem to be a little weak at times. The performances were great, especially Robert Downey Jr., but I think that this film falls short, when it comes to a true exploration of complex characters, which is the key to Fincher's previous films.So... my advice to everyone is to ignore most of the negative comments and see the film yourself. I found it to be a great story told in a remarkable way, very entertaining, with great performances, and wonderful direction.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

It moves too slow for my taste, especially in the first half.The movie almost seems split into two parts, the police trying to solve the murders, then jake gyllenhaals character trying to solve the murders. I found that the second half moved faster and was more intense and exciting. In the first half they focus too much on RDJs character.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
A great thriller about the true story of the brutal Zodiac Killer,"Just a few days ago, my mom and I watched a documentary on the famous Zodiac killer and his victims. It was incredibly interesting so it got me thinking about the film Zodiac that was released this year and lucky enough it was released on DVD today so I rented it. My friend and I just watched it a couple of hours ago and really liked it, especially on how it ended and was over all shot. I thought it was kinda cool how it started off like a documentary type of movie, but then was turning into a thriller that kept you going and guessing, even if you knew the whole story.In the small towns of California, there are several brutal murders, eventually going onto San Fransisco. These murders are extremely violent and very random, and every time it happens there is a message or sign that is left by the killer that calls himself the ""Zodiac"". He sends letters to the press on how and where he killed his victims and teases the police that they will never catch him. But Robert, one of the newspaper cartoonist starts to obsess about the killer, who he is and how they can capture him.With an all star cast, we had absolutely no problem with acting because it was terrific. Jake and Mark held their own very well. The whole story is very chilling and kept you going. The Zodiac Killer is a case that forever will remain a mystery and it was a great idea for a film, Fincher added a Se7en type of feel to this film. It's so funny how I knew the story and how it ended already, but I was actually just waiting to see what would happen in the next scene. I would highly recommend this film to any thriller fan, I'm sure you'll enjoy it, it's a great one for 2007.8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Overrated...,"At the end of last year when influential movie reviewers such as A.O. Scott from The New York Times were picking their top films of the year Zodiac was at the top of their list. So I finally watched Zodiac (not The Zodiac, I had made that mistake before) and I was disappointed. The cast was great and the acting phenomenal. The film was beautifully shot. You can feel the suspense as the Zodiac killer tracks down his victims and brutally murders them. But it was so long. Few films should be more than 2 hours (Godfather and a few other classics make the list) and this is not one of them. After the first hour and a half, the film felt endless and dragged on to boredom, just like the original Zodiac case did. So much of this film could be cut.

"Welcome Back, David Fincher.","Audiences have waited a while for a new piece of work from Mr. David Fincher and now that hiatus is officially over. Straying away from his style that earned him a 'cult' following, he brings out a new side to himself, some techniques not yet observed in his repertoire.ZODIAC feels like it was made by a perfectionist, everything flows so smoothly. The editing is pinch-perfect. Not only that, but Ficher shows that he is an actor's director as well, directing his cast into true life roles wonderfully. But the credit does not go all on to his shoulders. The actors have a lot to do with that themselves. Jake Gyllenhaal, who plays the author of the book of the same name, plays his character with an irresistible 'nerdi-ness' that is just fun to watch. Then it is amazing to watch Gyllenhaal transform that character into an obsessed wannabe detective, losing all focus and normal aspects of his life. Mark Ruffalo plays a humorous and overworked cop with incredibility. He really gets the job done. Downey Jr., however small his role was, plays on the screen with a witty insanity that brings most of the laughs of the movie. The acting really is a major pro. ZODIAC may come out at a long time slot but the viewer will never realize it because of the film pulling one in, and not wanting to leave until the case is solved. That is why ZODIAC is fantastic and a great welcome back gift from Fincher to not only his fans, but to everyone. ZODIAC is definitely the best film of 2007 so far.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Construction Watcher,"There's purpose in film, in certain film conventions of narrative. Its a sort of quantum physics of narrative. Not the uncertainty side, but the fact that there are different states; you can be at one state or another or another but never in between. Humans think this way, perhaps because you cannot have half a person, half a mind.Anyway, there are several discrete stations that we accept in relation to film stories, several discrete distances between what we are allowed to see and what our avatar(s) see in the story. At one end is the mystery where our relationship is more with the writer or some god than the emotions in the story.And then at the other end is stuff like this, the purest form of which is the procedural. In this case, there is a mystery, a story to discover. We have on-screen detectives and within certain narrow limits, we discover what the detectives do. We may see things a little before, but we never see more or know more than they. Procedurals only appeared well after the detective meme settled into our narrative vocabulary. So it is a sort of second generational shift in the mechanics of discovery.And who is at the center? Robert Downey Jr, one our most talented folders  and by that I mean someone who plays a role, but also plays a metarole of an actor playing a part. Here his character tries to horn in on the narration and fails, becoming a substance abuser. How meta is that?I like Fincher. I like it when he is bolder, but all these guys like to do a project from time to time where the art is in the precision of the narrative placement. And he does amazingly well. It would have had to have been a procedural.There's a shot of the murdercab where the precision is noted as it follows the cab to the place. We are precisely over, precisely. The cab stays precisely in the center of the frame. Precisely. We are locked into what it moving, with no allowance for godly insight from other contexts. Its a statement.There's another quite wonderful statement. We see the Transamerica being constructed in an animated sequence. It seems particularly automated, deterministic. Like the film it is in, down to the expected text at the end, wherein we read what happened to the ""real"" people afterward.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
"""This Is The Zodiac Speaking""","With those five words and with countless threats and baffling cryptograms, a serial killer terrorized the San Francisco Bay Area in the late 60s and early 70s. In the thirty-five years since the attacks, the only suspect ever officially named in the case was Arthur Leigh Allen. Yet, recent DNA analysis seems to have eliminated Allen as a suspect. Like Jack the Ripper, the Zodiac's identity remains, to this day ... unknown.There have been a couple of other films about the Zodiac. But Director David Fincher's thriller is by far the most ambitious and high profile. Based on two books by researcher Robert Graysmith, the film starts off with reenactments of some of the killer's attacks. Most of the film, however, follows three men who were involved in the original investigation: Graysmith (Jake Gyllenhaal), Inspector Toschi (Mark Ruffalo), and reporter Paul Avery (Robert Downey, Jr.).Procedural in style, the film reminds me of ""All The President's Men"", with its dogged and maddening investigation by unofficial individuals. Here, Graysmith's obsession with the case matches the obsession of Woodward and Bernstein.""Zodiac"" has a big problem with pacing. Suspense is sporadic at best. Too much dialogue, and unnecessary sequences, especially in the film's middle Act, render considerable boredom. Given the film's length, these talky sequences could easily have been edited out.The film's production design and overall acting quality are good. I could have wished for more late 60's era music. ""The Hurdy Gurdy Man"" was good, but not enough. Authentic location shots add credibility to the story as non-fiction. The film's cinematography makes use of the new digital ""Viper"" camera. As such, ""Zodiac"" is significant in that it becomes the first major movie to be filmed without conventional videotape or film.A flabby screenplay interferes with what should have been a riveting thriller. Still, if you are interested in this true life crime case, Fincher's ""Zodiac"" records the lengthy, and futile, search for the infamous killer who still fascinates us, even after all these years. Unless this case is solved quickly, it will soon become a crime legend of historic proportions, every bit as haunting as the legend of Jack the Ripper.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
David Fincher's best is challenging and not for everybody,"""Zodiac"" is a perfect match of visionary director and hard to condense material. James Vanderbilt did an admirable job of taking a larger than one life story and somehow adapted all these people and events (chronicled in Robert Graysmith's two thorough books on the subject) into a script that works. He should have received an Oscar nomination, along with Fincher, supporting actor Mark Ruffalo (portraying Inspector Dave Toschi) and of course, ""Zodiac"" itself for best picture. But the silly academy doesn't reward films like this often and I'll bet less than 20% of them even saw it!As author James Ellroy says on a commentary track, this film is respectful of the victims. The intensity of a murder investigation has rarely been recreated more impressively than here. To compare modern (21st century) technology with what these folks had to work with in the late 60's/70's is to realize ""Zodiac"", whoever he was, had to be one of the dumb luckiest criminals of all time. His ideas were not original to put it politely and the fact he probably was a child molester really makes him a predator that treated society in general like a little innocent he abused for his own perverse reasons. Men who feel powerless and then get a big gun are the most dangerous fools of all because they're ticked off and want somebody, anybody to pay!",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
"Probably ""too realistic"" for its own good","The characters are all ""too mundane"". Even the obsessed character (often overacted) is quite bland (not Jake Gyllenhaal's fault, because he's awesome), let alone the incredible amount of police officers and detectives that we came across through the movie.All the performers look bored except Mark Ruffalo (clearly the heart and soul of the film). And even he gets axed for the conclusion in the third act (almost all Jake). I don't understand why Robert Downey Jr. was cast for this. He was pathetic. I didn't believe for a second he was a journalist. Not even a bad one. And he barely matters anyway.In the end, the movie is sterile. Almost like a mediocre documentary that can't create a narrative, this movie jumps so much trough time without giving the characters screentime to reflect and suffer the consequences of an unresolved case, that (probably intentionally) doesn't allow the viewer to feel anything for anybody. The movie wants you to focus on the minutia of the police work and that gets old.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Riddles and murders,"A very tough movie to watch, that is based on real life incidents and crimes. So for those who know what went down or how this ended (or didn't), it may feel nice to see David Fincher staying as close to the facts as possible. Witness accounts sometimes varied - even with one and the same person changing their story or what they remembered happened. So Fincher had to decide how he'd go on about it and what he'd shoot.Now if you are not as aware of how it all went down, you may feel dissapointed of how this goes about it. Maybe not at the beginning but certainly towards the end. Although I reckon even those knowing how this ended might feel underwhelmed. Like how you know what happened with the Titanic, but then still be ""surprised"" by the Iceberg.Technically the movie is ace - the cast is superb, even in the smallest roles. Fincher is a master craftsman, even if some may feel sometimes (often?) his movies lack heart or whatever else they might want them to have. You can't fault him when it comes to filmmaking. That doesn't mean you will like this movie of course. It's very unique and very clinical. But still no matter what you know or don't, the suspense level is as high as it gets! Frustration may kick in - understandable! Imagine what the characters are going through - not just when the vivid murders happen, but generally speaking.A tough watch, that may not even be as ""rewarding"" in the usual sense as the viewer may wish it to be ... but that is why it's good and different ...",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Convincing crafted and engaging even if it does require patience from the viewer due to the nature of the material,"Several people have already been murdered by the time a series of letters are sent out to San Francisco newspapers from someone calling himself The Zodiac, claiming responsibility and providing details to prove it. Providing a series of ciphers with clues to his identity, Zodiac taunts the police with more letters and murders. On one paper introvert cartoonist Robert Graysmith and journalist Paul Avery start their own investigation, overlapping with police inspectors Toschi and Armstrong. Weeks become months become years and the periodic killings and letters continue while the investigations continues to be one inconclusive lead after another.It is understandable perhaps that this film did not do that well in the US because it is not an easy sell to audiences who are used to serial killer movies going a certain way most of the time. It probably didn't help that Se7en was mentioned in almost every review of Zodiac because the two are very different despite sharing the serial killer theme. Zodiac is not quite as good as Se7en although it is close, but the challenge is the way it is a good film because it is a much less obvious product. The story covers decades and lacks an ending that ""traditional"" serial killer movies normally have  the difficulties in delivery are obvious and it is to the film's credit that it still manages to be interesting and engaging.The script is not perfect and I did think it could have more in the way of layering and less of some other things but the most impressive thing about it is how well it flows forward and hangs together. The captions vary from ""three hours later"" to ""one year later"" but even with the constant jumps in time, it still works well and never feels fragmented or like we're missing something in the jumps. The script develops the case well and manages to bring out a realistic feel that is refreshingly downbeat and different from other cop thrillers and in doing this it is engaging but, and I stress the but, it does require patience. It is slow and the strength is in the detail rather than a fast-paced, exciting thriller plot, which I found rewarding and interesting but I can also understand why many viewers turned away from it for the same reason. It doesn't feel like 160 minutes very often and there are only a few aspects that I felt could have been removed totally (Graysmith's wife is a character that could and should have been lost to ""artistic license"").With a solid script in place a lot does rest on the delivery to make it more than an ""OK"" story. Fincher's direction is as strong as one would expect. He matches the material with a realistic eye and when he does use special effects they are well done and befitting the tone of the film. He excels at some points, producing murders are truly horrific and haunting. He draws strong performances from almost the entire cast, although it is Gyllenhaal who tends to dominate the film with an assured performance that subtly builds from geeky fascination to one nearing obsession. He is well supported by a typically solid Ruffalo who nicely moves his character from a working detective to a man broken and tired by the whole thing. Edwards was a surprise find and was good support but, while I enjoyed his presence, I did think that Downey Jr pushed his performance a bit too hard as it clashed with the more downbeat characters played by the others. Sevingy is handed a difficult character and can't make it work within the film, even if there is nothing wrong with what she does. Koteas, Cox, Terry and others provide good minor turns while Lynch is quite chilling as one of the possible suspects.Overall then, an interesting and convincing account of the failed investigation into the Zodiac killer. The challenges are obvious but are mostly overcome thanks to a strong all-round delivery but it is worth noting that it will have no traditional climax and does require patience from the viewer.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
"A still Open Serial Killer Case at the end, a failure of Act of Justice","It's a two and a half an hour long movie, but this is not the thing that makes the Zodiac boring; it's the non-stopping phone ring rings! We, the viewers, kept yelling ""Somebody please answer the phone!"" all the time, since more than half of the movie took place at the newspaper agency. Instead of playing a cool mob music at the sound background, for some reason or other the sound crew keep ringing the office phones. Especially when you consider those phones are the 1960s' grandma phones with the most nerve-racking ringing melody.Collecting the whole factual news regarding the Zodiac killer, director Fincher serves us a still open serial killer case. Detectives and newspaper crew join hands together to solve the mystery which Zodiac left after. The detectives even caught the right killer once, though after his interrogation he was released for the deficiencies of evidence. Years passed by and only one detective remained involving with the case. Everyone else quit, everyone else gave in. He froze his research and let time go by. Then a cartoonist appears, who seemed like he was having fun from the game at the beginning. Yet the cartoonist took every detail seriously, collected and manipulated every useful information and combined each clue together. Finally, he resolved the Zodiac mystery; and found out the criminal. When he stated the name of whom he found, the detective begins helping him coming to the same culmination he came years ago: The criminal is distinct. He is known identically. However, there is still no sufficient evidence. At that point, act of justice fails.The ending connects with the reality: The Zodiac case is still open. The criminal is not yet caught because of the deficiencies of evidence. All we need to have is someone like Sherlock Holmes. This case needed Sherlock Holmes. Zodiac, the movie, needed a hero detective to detect the necessary evidence. Regrettably, Fincher didn't think the same way we thought. He took an empty pride in leaving a case open and a criminal uncaught, to show us a failure of Act of Justice.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
"Oh God, save us all.","I am not sold on this film. At over two and a half hours, it seemed as long as the investigation itself.Why didn't David Fincher give us a tight and exciting film like Se7en? Yes, the investigation had an impact on many people other than those who were killed, and Jake Gyllenhaal, Mark Ruffalo, Robert Downey Jr. did a credible job of showing that, but there just wasn't the emotion that we saw with Brad Pitt. It just seemed like a long, boring investigation of little things that suggested who the killer might be.The bottom line is despite a few award nominations, the film won none, and that is because there are many better films out there. I expected a lot and was sorely disappointed.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
"Slow, But Fascinating","My overall impression was good, and the film certainly made me more interested in the case. From what I understand, the film is fairly accurate in its portrayal of the real life events.

It's a movie for those interested in law and crime, but not for those looking for a thriller or action.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
It's not necessary to watch this film. Save yourself 2 and a half hours.,I'm a big fan of David Fincher and the photography and atmosphere is above expectations. But...:this film is so boring and so pointless that the audience is carried for 150 minutes only because they started watching and want to see how it ends. You're going to be disappointed.More sophisticated people will tell you that this is a master piece with tension and atmosphere and crude but simple violence. Just because a film peace is sloooow doesn't mean it's a good film.So many times you think you're close to solve the enigma and this sad plot works for those who doesn't know the (real) story of the Zodiac that is depicted in this film.Trust me: spare you a lot of time and go on Wikipedia to read the Zodiac story which is complex and chilling without the need of a dramatization of a pointless 2 ad a half hours.,5.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Goatiac,"For me, this is the best David Fincher movie I've seen yet, I haven't seen Se7en or Fight Club so that could change, but right now this is my favorite of his, Zodiac is an astonishing movie about a real life murder case, while Se7en might be called the best fictional murder story, Zodiac is probably the best biopic ever made, topping The Social Network.Imagine if you took Iron Man, Hulk, and Mysterio and put them in a real life crime murder thriller, Zodiac did that and payed off incredibly well, this is a masterpiece of a biopic and easily Fincher's most underrated movie, it grips you from the very first frame and never lets you go.Jake Gyllenhaal is one of my favorite actors of all time and he gives his best performance since Donnie Darko, Mark Ruffalo and RDJ were also great in the movie and it has some of the best music I've ever heard and one of the best opening sequences I've ever seen, with fantastic cinematography and incredible direction and editing, I mean this is one of the best directed films ever.The scene were Jake Gyllenhaal's character goes into the basement, the stare down between Paul and Robert, and the ending, are some of the best scenes in any David Fincher movie, only a really masterful filmmaker could inflict such fear, such tension, and such dread with a biopic, and this might be the best one I've ever seen.I have to give Zodiac an A+",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
One of David Fincher's better movies,"For me, it isn't his best, but it really is an impressive film. The best thing about Zodiac is its atmosphere, it is really quite chilling and affecting. Equally impressive is the story, it is a very intriguing one and told very cleverly as it probes the limits of knowledge and evidence with startling power. The script is very well written and really makes you think. And it isn't a David Fincher movie without great visuals and indeed Zodiac has that. The cinematography is really quite skillful and the scenery, locations and lighting match the brooding atmosphere wonderfully. Fincher also does a superb directing, in fact his direction is a primary factor in what makes Zodiac one of his better movies. This serial killer is also quite different, and this is in a good way. Fincher allows the brutality of the murders to take second place to how the investigation takes its toll on the protagonists, and I for one found that quite refreshing. The acting is equally good, Jake Gyllenhaal can be bland sometimes, but he has given some good performances too and his performance here is one of them. Mark Ruffalo is even better, and Robert Downey Jnr even more so. So overall, different but refreshing, clever and well made film and one of Fincher's better movies. 9/10 Bethany Cox",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
"A good story, but it didn't really work for me","I've come to regard David Fincher as a dynamic filmmaker with slick fast moving films which keep you on the edge of your seat.I was expecting more of the same with Zodiac last night. I did get one of those qualities. It was certainly fast moving. It spent little time hanging around for us to absorb the vast amounts of evidence and facts that came with the case which led to it being less engaging for me. It dealt with the evidence in too much of a 'matter of fact' manner without concentrating on what it was supposed to do, which is entertain us. I also found that the large time jumps in the case where there were no letters from the Zodiac interrupted the flow of the film. In a well constructed film this should never happen.It's not all bad. It was an interesting story and certainly had it's tense moments. Perhaps being in America at the time would have helped. Again though, in a well made film this shouldn't matter. For me it erred too much on the style of 'documentary' and didn't have enough character development for me to enjoy it massively as a film. The first 20 minutes (before the huge evidence overload came into play) were exciting and I was thinking it was going to be great.Unfortunately it didn't keep it up. I suspect it would probably be more enjoyable on a second viewing now that I have got to grips with all the intricate parts of the case, but I just don't know if it's worth it, which is a shame. I wouldn't have associated this film with Fincher at all if I hadn't known",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Well made but lacks suspense,"The movie is well made and has very good acting. I did give the movie 7 out of 10. However, the movie lacks any suspense at all. I felt like this movie could have been much better if they incorporated more suspense and add some fear to the movie.The movie honestly plays out like a Discovery channel documentary as the cartoonist gets more involved with the Zodiac case which leads to him discovering clues and things the cops missed out on during their investigation.The story is semi-interesting but not nearly as good as Fight Club or Seven by the same director.The movie only grossed 35 million at this time and had a budget of 85 million. Other than 2 early scenes, this movie could have easily been PG (not pg-13). It just didn't feel like a movie about a serial killer. It felt too much like a documentary and probably was a bad idea for the big screen.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Top-notch thriller based on the true story of America's most notorious serial killer.,"The complex shooting script was written by James Vanderbilt and producers and filmmaker David Fincher decided to hire a private investigator to track down the real-life Zodiac survivor. A thrilling and thorny film about an ambitious San Francisco cartoonist/journalist named Robert Graysmith (Jack Gyllenhaal) becomes an amateur sleuthing detective obsessed to chase the Zodiac Killer, an unidentified series killer on the lam who terrorizes Northern California with a killing spree . Along the way , Robert befriends Paul Avery (Robert Downey Jr.) , a reporter whose drinking gets in the way of doing his job. Set between 1968 and 1983, in the San Francisco Bay Area while Zodiac taunting the local police . Some tracks puts him onto the path of police inspector David Toschi (Mark Ruffalo) and Inspector William Armstrong (Anthony Edwards) who have thus far failed to detain his man ; Sherwood Morrill, a veteran handwriting expert (Philip Baker Hall) ; Linda del Buono (Clea DuVall) , a convict who knows essential clues about Zodiac , among others . There's more than one way to lose your life to a killer !. When a series of murders terrorized California, one man took responsibility for them all !.It results to be a suspenseful , twisted , intriguing and at times depressing film in which the protagonists attempt to find the true guilty of some grisly killings , as they'll stop at nothing to achieve their purports and at whatever cost . Based on real events and written by Robert Graysmith, with a storyline over 200 pages long and to prevent any problems with length that such a long script might cause, the director focus on the lives and careers of the detectives and newspaper people. Jake Gyllenhaal stars as Robert Graysmith , giving a terrific acting as a driven young man desperate to discover a series murderer , well accompanied by Robert Downey Jr. As a drunk reporter and Mark Ruffalo as a failed police inspector who finally finds redemption . The staging is apparently simple, nothing of the baroque style of ¨Seven¨. Most of the scenes consist of two guys walking into a room , sitting around a cup of coffee and talking six pages of dialogue . Directot David Fincher said that he wanted everything to go fast moving . But appearances are deceiving, so in one scene he gets to gather 600 extras, while the costume designer has to dress them using period clothes , belts and pants at the time . The recreation of the city is fascinating, the company ""Digital Domain"" contributes to this in good measure . The scenarios created by computer and the real ones emerge with a naturalness that makes them indistinguishable. Fincher got what he wanted, to make a totally atypical thriller. Enjoyable and attractive movie with atmospheric scenes , sensational production design , agreeable performaces , sense of style and abundant backstories filled with flashbacks . This excellent movie is perfectly interpretated by a magnificent plethora of actors playing interesting roles with a great support cast , such as : Chloë Sevigny , John Getz , Philip Baker Hall , John Terry, Donald Logue, Candy Clark , Elias Koteas , Dermot Mulroney , Lee Norris , David Lee Smith , Clea DuVall , Jason Wiles , Paul Schulze, James Le Gros , John Carroll Lynch ,Paul Schulze and several others. This movie has been imitated ad nauseam and in contemporary film lists it always occupies a prominent position and its prestige grows every year.Displaying an intriguing and sensitive musical score by great composer David Shire . Equally , a glimmer and evocative cinematography by cameraman Harris Savides , showing adequately the color in the period piece by the time. This charming and suspenseful motion picture was competently directed by David Fincher , though it results to be overlong . David has directed 7 actors in Oscar nominated performances: Brad Pitt, Taraji P. Henson, Jesse Eisenberg, Rooney Mara,Rosamund Pike, Gary Oldman, and Amanda Seyfried. Fincher has shot TV commercials for clients that include Nike, Coca-Cola, Budweiser, Heineken, Pepsi, Levi's, Converse, AT&T and Chanel. He has directed music videos for Madonna, Sting, The Rolling Stones, Michael Jackson, Aerosmith, George Michael, Iggy Pop, The Wallflowers, Billy Idol, Steve Winwood, The Motels and, most recently, A Perfect Circle. As a film director, he has achieved huge success with Seven (1995), Fight Club (1999) , Panic Room (2002) , The Social Network (2010) , The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo (2011) , Gone Girl (2014) . Zodiac (2007) rating : 7.5/10. Better than average. The picture will appeal to thrilller buffs . Well worth watching.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Wouldn't Recommend Zodiac,"Can't really say I enjoyed Zodiac.It started fairly decent then lost momentum half way through. Not especially gory which is a good thing. Not especially exciting either. The story jumps around from the murders to each of the three main characters (the cartoonist, the news reporter, the detective) so it feels it a little disjointed. You never really connect with any of the characters. The movie is not really about the people investigating the Zodiac but the investigation itself. This is when the story really bogs down. Could have cut an hour out of Zodiac as the second half really drags.Overall, just a blah kind of movie.",5.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
The All-Consuming Zodiac Killer,"A couple of years ago, I read an article about how some people are still obsessed with the Zodiac serial killer case. Since the murderer was never apprehended, this case has fascinated a number of people for almost 40 years. There are websites and all kinds of people, apparently, who can't let go of this famous case.Lo and behold - here's a movie about that obsession. I, probably like a number of viewers, thought this was just another film about the murderer, and it looked that way for the first hour of the 157-minute movie. However, it turns out be just as much a story about one guy who has this obsession about finding the killer. That man is ""Robert Graysmith,"" a cartoonist for the San Francisco Chronicle. He is played by Jake Gyllenhaal. The movie is based on Graysmith's books on the Zodiac killer, so it's no surprise the story winds up revolving around him.For moviegoers looking for a hard-nosed, brutal serial-killer story, this must have been a disappointing film because it turns out to be a character study of ""Graysmith"" plus an in- depth behind-the-scenes look at police procedure which, as any cop could tell you, can be tedious work. However, there is still is enough violence and suspense, particularly early on, to satisfy some and there is a lot of information on the crimes itself, and a lot of suspects to entertain the ""whodunit"" mystery-solving viewer.I admit the story began to drag a bit after two hours but overall, I thought it was an intelligent, interesting profile of all concerned: most-likely killer, detectives, newsmen, witnesses, other suspects, Graysmith's wife - everyone who could possibly been involved with this long-standing unanswered crime case. In a way, this story reminded me of the CSI shows on TV where every five minutes we get a new can't-miss suspect who turns out to be a false lead. However, in this story, no one was ever tried and convicted. But, the movie does come to a conclusion on who the guilty party was, and makes a convincing case for it.Thus, at least according to the film, Mr. Graysmith's work was not in vain. (The real-life suspect died of a heart attack, so we may never know for sure.)The downside for Mr. Graysmith, and people we may not even know about, was that his life and others have been radically altered for the worse this obsession to find the Zodiac killer. It cost Mr. Graysmith his marriage.Overall, this is a bit long but it features excellent acting by everyone and offers diverse characters. I would like to have seen more with Arthur Allen. John Carroll Lynch is not a big- name actor but he's good and, for obvious reasons, a fascinating person in this story. Director David Fincher doesn't offer up the edge-of-your-seat thrillers as he did in ""Se7en"" and ""Panic Room,"" but this is still worth a look and recommended.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

Watch The Pink Panther instead,"Disappointing attempt for a great interesting subject. One of the greatest examples of wasted opportunities. A great cast with good dialog but simply too long. The result is a boring film where the director could simply blame editing for being lazy (I would not blame the editor for given up on this one!). Definitely not the same old good guy versus bad guy detective story; and for that perhaps one could try to watch it. I rather see the whole Inspector Clouseau series without any bathroom breaks, including the one with Alan Arkin instead of recommending this one. In sum, if you see it, bring Extra Strenght pills to avoid a Zodiache.Rotildo (a friend, not an enemy).",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Too much cute humor and a lackluster story,"Zodiac, the story of the famous Zodiac killer, is perhaps Fincher's weakest film yet. Despite a great opening scene set to Three Dog Nights ""Easy to be Hard"", the film works toward an anti-climatic ending. The computer effects are overdone, used mostly to lapse the long periods of time that take place between the activity of the Zodiac killer. At a point in the film, our focus turns to the quest of a cartoonist who becomes obsessed with finding out who the Zodiac is. We're often left questioning if he himself is the Zodiac. Unfortunately, the story is all over the place, switching between the many character's ongoing and interconnected quests to solve the puzzle of the Zodiac's identity. The fear of the Zodiac was that he could have been anybody, and this selling point was hardly addressed. There are plenty of plot holes, unexplained character reactions, and unexplained events as well. And of course, the computer graphics were mostly unnecessary. Fincher's style is only present in a few well done scenes, leaving most of the photography as boring and repetitive series of medium and close shots. This basically mirrors the story, repetitive and a bit boring. However, the opening sequence is one to remember, and the film deserves merit for being a notch above most Hollywood films... dare I say than ""The Departed""? All in all, I'll give it a 6 out of 10. Not good enough to buy, but not bad enough to write off David Fincher as one of the last hopes for the industry.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
How could I have never heard of the Zodiac Killer until this came out?,"Believe it or not, I had literally never heard of the Zodiac Killer until around the time that ""Zodiac"" got released in the theaters (cut me some slack; I was born many years after the killings took place). So, now I've seen the movie portraying everything surrounding the murders. I have to say that it's a really good movie. It focuses less on the murders themselves than on the investigations. The main character is actually Robert Graysmith (Jake Gyllenhaal), a reporter for the San Francisco Chronicle. I, for one, was amazed at how he and the cops discovered the various patterns and clues. Therefore, maybe it helps if you nothing about the Zodiac Killer: everything in the movie is more of a surprise. As for the murderer's actual identity...well, in case you don't know the story, I won't spoil it.Aside from Gyllenhaal, there are other people doing great roles here. Robert Downey Jr. plays Graysmith's cohort Paul Avery. Avery sees his responsibility as a reporter, but personal problems impede his work; he's the type of wretch whom you can't help but admire. Mark Ruffalo plays cop Dave Toschi. Toschi is intent on solving the case and doesn't want the press interfering, but understands that he has to put up with the media. Also starring are Anthony Edwards, Brian Cox, Philip Baker Hall, Donal Logue, Chloe Sevigny, James LeGros and Candy Clark (I assume that she's the same Candy Clark who starred in ""American Graffiti"").All in all, I recommend this movie very much. I got the feeling that the tension between Graysmith and Toschi mirrored the tension that must have taken over San Francisco surrounding the murders. And as a side note, we get to hear some great music (e.g., Donovan's ""Hurdy-Gurdy Man""). A very good movie indeed.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
2 hours 37 minutes Of anti climax,Its a long long film and if your English the American dialect can be hard to interpret . Lots of information and events that presumably are factually correct of this serial killer . The Director was unable to add drama to the film resulting in an end that to many would be unsatisfying.

A masterpiece,"Zodiac is a masterpiece and I believe it is David Fincher's most accomplished film ever. I have never been fully enamored of either Seven or The Game. Fight Club was a feeble and ultimately mind-numbing shadow of a great book. Panic Room was an enjoyable technical exercise and not much more. With Zodiac I believe David Fincher has vaulted himself to the front rank of American filmmakers. The film is a richly textured and densely layered meditation on crime, celebrity, obsession and media manipulation. To call Zodiac a serial killer movie is to do it a huge disservice. This film is the work of a master filmmaker at the peak of his powers.I was delighted to discover a film where intelligent characters converse with each other in a thoughtful manner. This film requires and rewards attention. It is a rebuke to the obnoxious and annoying MTV style which will pollute theaters yet again on Friday when 300 comes out. The film looks great and is shot with a great deal of care and attention to detail. However, David Fincher's films always look great and this is not the area where this film really shines. This film really shines in it's understated, realistic and yet wholly entertaining dialog and characterization. Fincher has made the bold choice to take the time to create credible characters and to actually give those characters something to say. This is a film where how a character says something means just as much as what he or she says. Most films assign one trait to a character and then have that person behave according to that trait. The characters in Zodiac are complex three dimensional people. Fincher does not pander to the audience in any way. He does not ask you to even like anyone on screen, he just wants you to recognize their humanity.For a movie that is intensely dark and creepy it is amazing how funny Zodiac is. I actually laughed out loud during several points in the film. I never laughed once during Fight Club and that was a movie that seemed to be constantly trying to elbow you in the ribs. The humor is allowed to grow organically out of the characters and situations. Fincher has employed a consistently light touch for such heavy material. Extreme and pressured circumstances, like the ones these characters find themselves in, always breed dark humor. Fincher allows for this humor to come out and far from weakening the story it actually strengthens the tone of the film. For once Fincher allows his technique to serve the performances and the story he is trying to tell and not the other way around.The film avoids the nihilistic sensationalism of Seven by not allowing the audience to identify with the killer or get off in any way on his crimes. The murder scenes are swift, brutal and devoid of any sexy thrill. This is murder as ugly and heinous as the actual act. The ""serial killer as rock star"" idea is not indulged. This killer is a sad, pathetic and twisted individual with a disgusting pathology. This film is completely removed from ridiculous movies like Hannibal and Red Dragon, where the filmmakers seem to encourage the audience to identify with a psychopath.The individual characters come to pursue the Zodiac killer for many different reasons. Fincher, wisely I think, does not spend a whole lot of time explaining the psychological reasons that lead each character to become obsessed with the case. Again he gives the audience enough credit to trust them to observe and make up their own minds as to why these characters do what they do. Audiences have become lazy and very passive in their viewing habits. They expect everything to be explained to them and all of the work to be done for them. Viewing a work of art cannot be a passive experience. You cannot watch a film like Zodiac passively. The obsessive attention that Fincher lavishes on the production must also be employed when watching it. If you do not pay close attention you will miss important details that will ultimately make the film a much richer experience for you.Fincher has become a great actor's director. All of the actors in the film exhibit a joy of performance that only comes from working with a director who is willing to push them to do their best work. Fincher obviously expects nothing less than excellence. This excellence is very much in evidence in the many pitch perfect performances in the film. Special kudos should go to Robert Downey Jr. and Mark Ruffalo for their intelligent and subtle work.It is unfortunate that Zodiac seems to be fairing so poorly at the box office. Perhaps Fincher's fan base was scared off when they realized that the film was not going to be Seven 2. It would be a shame if Fincher turned away from the fascinating and thoughtful direction he seems to be going in. I wish there were more filmmaker's that had the guts to try and make big budget pictures with intelligence and care that are actually about something other than a marketing campaign. Zodiac is such a film. It is a movie that is thrillingly open and alive to the fantastic possibilities of narrative cinema.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
A mixed bag of good and tedious scenes.,"If they wanted to give moviegoers a sense of how painstaking and tedious soving a serial killer case can be, they succeeded. I really felt for the detectives (and civilians) wanting so badly to catch the murderer. But as an audience member, I had to sit through a lot of banter back and forth involving methodology, code-cracking, and leg work.Maybe that is why films based entirely on fiction are more thrilling, they don't have to go out of their way to do justice to the lives of real living people who worked so hard. I can understand them wanting to show these men's lives outside of the work, but this made for a very long viewing experience without enough suspense or fleshed-out drama to make it top notch.One thing for which I must praise Fincher is that he kept the violence to a minimum, as this movie was more about the investigation than the crimes themselves, and rightfully so--hence the higher grade than I might normally give. Totally worth seeing, but not a ""you've gotta see it"" movie.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Serial Killer True Story Epic,"Directed by David Fincher this is a deep dive into the events of the still unsolved Zodic murders of the San Francisco Bay area of the late 1960's. The film is long, clocking in at 2 hrs 37 min and stars Jake Gyllenhaal, Robert Downey Jr. And Mark Ruffalo, all putting in great performances in their respective roles.I didn't know too much about this case before watching the movie, so was not knowing prior, what would be the outcome. This is a frustrating film... in the sense of it is a film about frustration (as well as incompetence from all involved). Being about true events, of course it's not possible to be suspenseful or shocking in a way that an original screenplay could be. Instead we get a character driven story of this case that shocked and scared America for years. We see incompetence as the police grapple with dealing with victims in various jurisdictions and (by todays eyes), sloppy police and forensics work. And even the serial killer seems erratic and incompetent in his own methods.But the story is gripping none the less as we see the crimes envelope and and to differing degrees, take over the lives of the key characters involved. This film spans over three decades which are all portrayed beautifully with great set, prop and costume design throughout.An excellent character movie based on true events. Just don't expect a slasher film. 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Good film but unnecessary long,"If you are expecting a good thriller with intensity like Se7en (from same director) then lose the expectations and you will probably enjoy this. This IS a good film, I would just not classify it as a thriller, but rather as a mystery case where people are trying to follow the complex and sometimes misleading clues. The film follows a cartoonist working at a newspaper who has a knack for puzzles and tries to find out who the legendary Zodiac killer is. Most of the killings happen at the beginning, with a couple more occurring in the middle of the film, and indeed there are some ""thriller"" moments, when the protagonist goes off by himself to search for clues in places he thinks the killer might be hiding or was there. However, I did find it unnecessary long. Maybe it was because of my expectations that I was going in to see a completely different film. On a second watching I did enjoy following through the protagonist's logic path and the portrayal of the suspect murderer is excellent. The plot is quite rigid, and you can't find a fault there. The only fault of this film was its length. When you watch something that doesn't really offer that much in sentiments (be it fear, adrenaline, happiness or anything else) you will probably be bored after the first 90 minutes pass. When that happens you stop following the plot and that damages the overall experience, because this film is solely relying on following through the plot and thinking along the protagonist.So evaluating this film: good plot, good characters and portrayal of characters, excellent acting, but unnecessary long which makes me inclined to give it a 6/10. Granted some of the plot would suffer if the length was less, but the damage done to the viewer's attention span is much more of a serious issue for me.My advice: relax and if you enjoy good detective stories and/or follow famous murder cases in history, you will probably enjoy this.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

John Carroll Lynch and Brian Cox also make the most of their appearances.

A thrilling and special movie,"David Fincher is a great crime movie director. But ""Zodiac"" is certainly a special crime movie. This movie digs into the minds of the investors. Each character cares about the Zodiac Killer for a reason. There's no specific reason as to why everyone wants to find the killer, but the desire to fill in the blank is the biggest motivation investigators have in this movie.Every scene involving the Zodiac Killer is suspenseful. Fincher's style of editing, camera movement, and color palette makes this one of the most gripping and thrilling crime movies ever. The pacing of this movie is very appropriate for a crime movie like this-there are intense sequences, but there are also breaks in between those sequences.David Fincher perfectly captures emotions of characters that would otherwise be a very hard to understand; after all, we as the audience is only the observer. But somehow Fincher did it. He can turn complicated emotions and a sense of duty into something the audience can relate to. And that makes this movie a great movie.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
The yawning of the Age of Aquarius,"On the strength of the advance advertising, I was really looking forward to seeing ""Zodiac"". I expected a taut, tense thriller. Instead, I found myself mind-numbingly bored for two and a half hours.""Zodiac"" should have been an exciting tale of a cat-and-mouse game between a murderer and those out to catch him. At the very least, it should have been a fascinating psychological portrait of what makes a killer tick -- or, for that matter, what drives the police and the reporters on his trail.""Zodiac"" unfortunately fails on both scores. It plods when it should race, does not engage our emotions, and does not provide compelling motives for the Zodiac or for those pursuing him. (The victims are appallingly disposable. We are given no incentive to care about them at all.) Indeed, the ""evidence"" presented by the film did not convince me of the main suspect's guilt. For instance, why does the killer adopt a different modus operandi for each murder? (We are told that the Zodiac took credit for crimes he did not commit. Possible, but not very persuasive.) ""Zodiac"" works best as an exploration of Robert Graysmith's obsession with the case, to the point of risking his marriage to bring the killer to justice. But, even here, despite Jake Gyllenhaal's stellar performance, the film does not quite succeed.""Zodiac"" has a great soundtrack of hits from the late 1960s and 1970s, and it wonderfully captures the look of that plaid-and-polyester period. (Gracious, did we really wear such ugly clothes?) There is one slip-up on the screenwriter's part. The suspected killer is referred to as possibly being a pedophile. I'm pretty certain that term did not come into common usage until after the mid-1980s. In the late 1960s and 1970s, we would have called him a child molester. (More to the point, however, why would a pedophile target adults rather than children?) I read one review that called ""Zodiac"" a police procedural. For me, however, it felt more like an epidural. Despite a constellation of acting talent, the stars simply do not align.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Solid movie from David Fincher,"I first watched this back when it came out. Being young, I didn't really get it but man it scared the crap out of me. It was my first introduction to this thing called serial killer.Now rewatching it again in 2022, knowing the killer still hasn't been identified but the hardest code has been cracked after 51 years, I hope one day we will be able to truly know who it is.Tight storytelling, scary murder scene based on reality. Despite the horrifying nature, David Fincher continued to create masterpieces.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
"Because it's non-fiction, it's forgiven for being unfocused","My favorite part of Zodiac was watching the facts about the case, accumulated by cops, reporters, and an intrepid cartoonist, slowly coalesce into a clear picture of the killer. When it's finally apparent who did it, over a decade later, it's satisfying. It's just a shame the script itself is so scattered. No where is this more apparent then in the Gyllenhaal character.Gyllenhaal plays a cartoonist who becomes obsessed with finding the identity of the Zodiac. No clues are given as to why this straight laced Eagle Scout would shun family and job to take such a dark journey. Fincher goes to extremes to show what a loving, single father he is at first. But later, he is holed up in his apartment, surrounded by the detritus of his investigation, looking like a mad hermit. His wife comes to check up on him, but he refuses to give up the chase and resume his role as father and husband. It's not clear why this change has taken place. Ruffalo's cop pursues the killer because it's his job. It's the job of Paul Avery (Downey, Jr.) as well. But Gyllenhaal's motives are unclear.There are whole passages of time where main characters drop out sight. Sometimes it's Gyllenhaal's movie, sometimes Ruffalo's. When the film follows Ruffalo, along side partner Anthony Edwards, the movie works best. They're continually vexed by the technological limitations of their time, yet they somehow keep plodding through. Unlike Gyllenhaal's cartoonist, they have motives for what they do. They're cops. They solve crimes.And Paul Avery's descent into alcoholism and houseboat isolation? No reasons given. Hey, that's the way it happened in real life, so why try to give the character motives.If this was fiction, the vague character arcs wouldn't fly, and this film would be shorter and tighter. But under the true crime rubric, the fuzzy writing and slavish adherence to the book are forgiven by many. But when the smoke clears, this is just an over-long, under-motivated paean to a certain place and time. Evocative? Yes. Good storytelling? No way.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Anatomy of an investigation,"Given the fact that the story of the Zodiac killer, who left taunting notes in codes and cyphers bragging about his recent kills to the local papers, seemed already like a movie plot brought to life, (several existing films, most famously 1971's Dirty Harry already took inspiration from the real life events) a film adaptation of the tale seemed inevitable. Audiences can be thankful then, that the story was snapped up by the more than capable director David Fincher, himself no stranger to serial killer films after 1995's brilliant Se7en, who blissfully resists the temptation to morph the story into an uninspired, turgid teen slasher film, and instead present the tale as it actually transpired - as an engrossing crime drama. Zodiac looks and feels like a throwback to such 70s political detective stories as All the President's Men, and it is unquestionably refreshing to see a movie detailing a serial killer which is not afraid to allow its audience to think for a change.There is no question that director Fincher has done an abundance of research on his chosen topic, it's Fincher's reverence to his subject matter is both what makes the film a triumph, and yet proves its downfall all at the same time. While the details of the case are admittably fascinating, (though the supposedly objective portrayal of the case does feel rather biased at times, and it's clear who Graysmith, the author of the novel the film adapts, fingered as the real killer) and the film kicks off at a brisk pace, ensnaring the audience's attention right off the bat, it appears Fincher and screenwriter James Vanderbilt have worked perhaps too hard to incorporate every last trace of information regarding the case.While for the first half of the film, it becomes increasingly difficult to pry one's eyes from the screen, once the case moves to the point when the killing spree was long finished, the question is posed as to whether it was essential to the storyline to show every last potential lead to the case. From this point on, the film starts to drag, losing both its momentum and the audience's interest. In the end, for however much energy and factual interest Fincher can squeeze out of his film, it is still a 158 minute movie which the audience knows is going to end in an anti-climax, (anyone following the case in the news knows that the killer's real identity was never discovered) which after a while makes the audience wonder if every ominous piece of foreshadowing is really necessary. A bit of judicious editing, whittling down the talky bits, would make the film feel more streamlined, tense and far more effective.The fact that Fincher's project feels a touch fact bloated at times, especially in the middle section is a shame indeed, for when the film is good, it is a rousing success. The dramatic confrontation scenes crackle with sheer intensity, and the criminal investigation for the most part (especially during the film's beginning and end) is tense and engaging. Fincher also perfectly captures the feel for the period; the 1970s clothing, bustling newspaper offices complete with typewriters and liberal facial hair on most of the male cast members seem to throw the viewer back thirty years flawlessly. The film's score by David Shire also proves highly effective, both at amplifying the tension and dramatic punch of the confrontations with the killer, and helping bring the slower scenes to life more. Overall, the film's strong points still stand out fiercely over the slower bits, and it just feels like a shame whenever the film drags and starts to become uninteresting, since the stronger sections were so intensely engaging it feels almost unjust to begin to lose interest.The film's cast also helps the material rise from a more standard ""based on a true story"" serial killer drama to a more realistic and captivating take. Jake Gyllenhaal certainly fits the profile of the earnest young cartoonist who finds himself drawn in by the elusive killer's case, and overall he gives a strong performance though at times his character comes across as a poorly written device to advance the plot, which is irritating to say the least. Mark Ruffalo solidly inhabits the role of the weary inspector Toschi; his laid back charisma perfectly complimenting the character while avoiding the stereotype of the burnt out cop. The perfectly cast Robert Downey Jr. walks away with the show with an energetic and poignant performance as Paul Avery, the charismatic journalist whose life is slowly consumed by the unsolved case. Character actor Brian Cox also makes a welcome appearance as specialist Melvin Belli, and he shines in his brief scenes.Overall, Zodiac succeeds to such a great degree in so many aspects, it is unfortunate to see the more engaging elements of the plot weighed down by so many plot points which feel repetitive and unnecessary. The period feel is immaculate, and Fincher proves his mastery at creating tension more successfully than almost any other director still making films, but overall Zodiac feels like a far greater film struggling to emerge from a padded out simply acceptable film. The film still merits watching for its many successes, but be prepared to invest enough time, thought and interest to fully appreciate the film as a whole.-7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Bore-Fest,"The story of the Zodiac could have been interesting but this movie proved to be a two hour and forty minute bore-fest. Most of the movie is spent on the investigation as scene after scene piles on pieces of evidence for the characters to ponder. The movie tries (and fails) to show you how the investigation adversely affected the lives of a reporter (played by Robert Downey Jr), a homicide inspector (played by Mark Ruffalo), and a cartoonist (played by Jake Gyllenhaal)  hence the poster's tag line ""There's more than one way to lose your life to a killer.""The strategy of the movie is this: To show how frustrating and tiresome a murder investigation can be, the movie wants to put you through a frustrating and tiresome experience. To make us feel the way the characters spent long wasted hours sifting through the minutiae of the case in the vain effort to arrest a suspect, the movie puts you through a long 160 minutes of minutiae for you to sift through. The movie worked on me as intended  I was maddeningly frustrated and extremely tired. This is great story-telling? Nope, I'm not buying that pretentious load of baggage.How did the Zodiac affect the main characters? I wouldn't know. The movie never tries to understand them emotionally or psychologically. The script doesn't give them much to do except sift minutiae and the acting can't seem to rise above the ponderous bleakness stretched across the whole production.Zodiac is a waste of your time.

It's just hard to rewatch because it's a little long.People looking for a gory horror movie considering this is about a serial killer will be disappointed.

David Finche is back! (to form? Not quite),"This is what we have been waiting for from the great David Fincher? Not to say that this flick is bad-- because it is not-- but it just is not quite living up to some of his previous greats (The Game, Fight Club...). The film is a bit of a complicated mess. Multiple main characters make it difficult to really tell you the story from one perspective. The film pretty much covers, in great depth, the case of the ""Zodiac"" serial killer throughout the 60's and 70's. Jake Gyllenhal, Mark Ruffalo and Robert Downey Jr are all the main focus at one time or another. This leads me to my only real problem with the film -- the script. It was unfocused, ramblings of facts, fiction, suspense and odd-ball humor. For much of the film, I felt as if the script was so crazy that I wasn't compelled to even have a reaction. And the period's of time this movie jumps through is ridiculous. Sometimes we go weeks in advance, other times just months. Occasionally we skip over some years; but none the less, we are always skipping around every 10 or so minutes.

Darkness visible,"The final instalment in Fincher's epic dark trilogy showing the decline and fall of civilisation that began with Se7en differs in that it is not a work of fiction but is based on the true life events surrounding the Zodiac killer, who hunted his victims in and around San Francisco throughout the 70s.The movie opens in 1969 on the 4th of July with a stunning panoramic shot of fireworks over the city - an unforgettable image. Fincher's movie is based largely on the book by Robert Graysmith, a cartoonist at the San Francisco Chronicle who became obsessed with the case and ended up writing a book about it.Zodiac does a fantastic job of conveying the frustrating and exhaustive nature of the investigation, which spans almost two decades during the course of the film and remains open to this day.Unlike the fantasy world of TV shows like CSI, many cases of this nature are never solved or may take decades to close.Fincher takes us on this journey and we watch as the principle players in the Zodiac drama are forever altered by the case.The players are uniformly superb, in particular Jake Gyllenhal as Graysmith and Robert Downey Jr as Paul Avery, the crime reporter who covers the Zodiac case for the Chronicle.John Carroll Lynch gives an amazing portrayal of Robert Leigh Allen, the man Graysmith believes to be the killer.Art production to deliver a convincing 70s San Francisco is of the highest standard and the film is beautifully shot (look out for the recurring blue and yellow themes).Zodiac shows Fincher at the height of his considerable powers as a visual stylist and story-teller.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
"Gripping, slow-burning, character-driven detective thriller","Zodiac is the low-key, character-driven companion piece to director David Fincher's earlier serial killer film Se7en; albeit, with this picture replacing the former's grim violence and biblical depiction of hell on earth with a more routine and realistic depiction of the slow corruption of innocence and the lure of obsession, as three disparate individuals are united in their desire to ""unmask a mysterious and enigmatic murderer terrifying the San Francisco area"". The film isn't as shocking as Se7en, nor is it as jaw-dropping in its execution, instead harking back to the days of slow burning paranoia-thrillers like The Parallax View, Marathon Man, The Conversation, Dog Day Afternoon and All the President's Men. As a result, it's not as flashy - cinematically speaking - as Fincher's previous films, chiefly Se7en, Fight Club and Panic Room, with the director keeping the film rooted in reality and as unobtrusive - in terms of editing, production design and cinematography - as is humanly possible.The style fits the subject matter well, with the drama driven by dialog, performance and character interaction, while the suspense is bolstered by the slow, investigative procedures that the characters undertake in the valiant pursuit of the truth. It won't be to all tastes - as the reviews here and the poor box office in the States would confirm - but Fincher aficionados and fans of the films aforementioned should get a kick out of seeing an intelligent alternative to the flash and bang likes of Transformers, or whatever 70's horror/Asian re-make is en-vogue at the moment.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
its good but not great,"""Zodiac"" may frustrate viewers who come to David Fincher's latest film expecting a traditional serial killer thriller. The film begins with a couple of hair-raising and rather brutal recreations of murders carried out by the mysterious killer who terrorized the San Francisco Bay area in the late 1960s and early 1970s. These early scenes are shocking and, compared to the rest of the film, disorienting, because they offer the only time that we come close to seeing events from the killer's perspective. As the film progresses, the Zodiac killer himself fades into the background, and the movie turns into a meticulous and engrossing document of the investigation to track him down, an investigation that includes countless blind alleys and false clues and which to this day has not reached a conclusion. I would be more prone to label the somewhat rambling screenplay as sloppy storytelling if I did not feel that Fincher tells the story exactly as he wants to. The elusive narrative works, because the film is about an elusive villain.Jake Gyllenhaal plays Robert Graysmith, a cartoonist working for the ""San Francisco Chronicle"" at the time the Zodiac killer began his gruesome work. He becomes fascinated by the case, and takes it on as a sort of morbid personal hobby long after the police department has given it up as a lost cause. Graysmith eventually wrote the book on which this film is based, and according to his accounts, he discovered enough evidence about one of the suspects in the case to put the police back on his trail years after he'd been cleared for lack of evidence. Other characters come and go. Robert Downey, Jr. Does characteristically terrific work as a reporter at the ""Chronicle"" who grabs his own portion of notoriety through his involvement in the case. Mark Ruffalo and Anthony Edwards play the two detectives in charge of the investigation. Chloe Sevigny plays Gyllenhaal's put-upon wife, who gradually loses her husband to his obsession. All of the actors deliver thrilling performances, many of them against the odds. Since this isn't a character driven movie, many of the characters remain undeveloped, but not, for once, to the detriment of the film. This story isn't about the people involved, but rather about their role in the Zodiac saga; once they've served their purpose, Fincher dispenses with them. Ironically, a film that clocks in at nearly 3 hours exhibits a great deal of narrative economy.Parts of ""Zodiac"" are intensely creepy. Fincher effectively uses the rainy San Francisco atmosphere to its maximum potential, and the grimy browns and grays of the production design call to mind Fincher's other well-known films, like ""Seven"" and ""Fight Club."" But ""Zodiac"" is much more grown up than those films, and for an audience to enjoy it, it has to have an attention span. Long scenes are given to analyzing handwriting samples, recreating the scenes of murders, digging through newspaper clippings and files. You can tell that Fincher is fascinated by police work in the pre-CSI era, when fax machines were still a novel invention. He delves into the investigative process with a nearly fetishistic attention to detail, but he makes all of it endlessly mesmerizing. He does his best to bring everything to some sort of conclusion, but the real-life end to the story makes a complete conclusion impossible. This film is more about the journey than the destination, and what a journey it is.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

It was OK but has serious problems,"Movie based on the unsolved Zodiac killings in California in the 1960s-1970s. A man was killing people with no rhyme or reason and sent notes to California newspapers daring them to figure out who he was. Reporter Paul Avery (Robert Downey Jr.) and cartoonist Robert Graysmith (Jake Gyllenhaal) try to figure out who he is while police inspector Davod Toschi (Mark Ruffalo) and his partner (Anthony Edwards) try to catch him.This film has a lot of good things going for it--it's well directed (excellent use of wide screen), has some good acting (especially by Downey) and manages to wring some suspense out of the story despite the fact that you know how it ends. There's also good supporting performances by Chloe Sevigny and Dermot Mulroney. Still this film has three serious problems. One is Gyllenhaal. He is a good actor but appears totally out of his depth here. He wears one expression the entire movie and his acting quickly becomes annoying. The second is the length of this movie--it's way too long. It rambles on for 160 minutes and gets tedious more than once. I kept looking at my watch and more than once considered leaving. I stayed because I figured I had paid my $10.00 so--why not? Also the story keeps jumping around and, if something has nothing to do with the killer, it's tossed off casually.For example...Sevigny is introduced as a date of Gyllenhaal. We don't see her until about 30 minutes later and by this time she's his wife AND they have kids! No mention was made of them getting married or having kids.

One of the best films of the century,"Zodiac is an amazing film tackling obsession and reality. Stripped directly from the real life events in the late 60's and early 70's following Robert Graysmith, a cartoonist for the newspaper, becomes infatuated and obsessed with the zodiac killer. Who keeps sending zodiac cyphers to newspapers for the public to figure out.Zodiac isn't a slasher film nor does it have much action. It's a slow paced psychological drama about a man obsessed with a killer who has never been caught.What this movie does so well is the fact that you become obsessed with him to the point that you are stuck in your room researching the case for hours. Zodiac meticulously plots out it's information, paced throughout the movie, choosing to structure itself as more of a cinematic documentary. All this information the movie throws your way may be overwhelming, but not impossible to keep up with. This film makes you as obsessed with the case as much as the main character is himself.The film is masterfully directed, utilising digital cameras, which weren't that popular at the time and showing how well they can be used. Shots are just clean and smooth, yet the surrounding felt used and dirty. Some shots in this movie still stick in my head to this day. The opening car shot. The taxi cab and the time laps scene are just a few examples of shots that stick in my head.I don't have any problems with this movie at all and stands as one of my all time favourite movies.

Finchers best film,"This is Finchers best film to date and my personal favorite. Fincher is able to take a real and terrifying true story and turn it into a suspenseful detective story without it feeling exploitive or over the top. Even though it has an over 2 1/2 hour runtime it never feels like its lagging. It cuts to the chase and never goes in circles around what the story is really about. Even if you're not into true crime I feel you will enjoy this. With great performances to keep you engaged. The movie has that incredible quick editing that keeps the movie on yapper toes it has become Finchers trademark. The movie is able to grab and keep your attention and even at the end of the movie will have you asking more questions and for more. Not only a great movie overall but a great crime, thriller and mystery movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
"""This Is The Zodiac Speaking!""...","Director David Fincher's ZODIAC recounts the days, weeks, and years involved during and after the infamous killings. While the subject is extremely dark, Fincher wisely focuses less on the gory details of the murders, and more on the investigation, letters from the killer, the cryptic puzzles, etc., as well as the physical and psychological toll taken on everyone involved.We follow the reporters, represented by cartoonist, Robert Greysmith and chain-smoking, editorial columnist, Paul Avery (Jake Gyllenhaal and Robert Downey Jr.), as well as the police, with Inspectors David Toschi and William Armstrong (Mark Ruffalo and Anthony Edwards) on the case, getting no sleep and living on snacks.The near-mad obsession of all the main characters involved draws us in and keeps us riveted. This approach allows for a wide view of the story as it unfolds, and the back and forth between the newspaper people and the cops keeps things moving.At over two and a half hours, it seems much shorter. This is due in large part to the fact that the actual case is so disturbing / fascinating on its own, and, as of this writing, remains unsolved. Anyone who enjoys a great mystery / drama / suspense / thriller should watch this immediately!... P. S.- Brian Cox makes a perfect Melvin Belli...",,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
a thinking-man's thriller,"With ""Zodiac,"" director David Fincher returns to the crime thriller territory he explored to such effectiveness in ""Seven"" a dozen odd years ago.For over a decade - from December 1968 to the late 1970's - a serial killer calling himself The Zodiac terrorized the San Francisco Bay Area, dispatching his victims seemingly at random while keeping up a cryptic, cat-and-mouse correspondence with several major newspapers in the area. Despite some impressive leads, the killer was never caught and the murders eventually stopped as quickly and mysteriously as they had started.At 160 minutes, ""Zodiac"" lacks the streamlining and telescoping we've come to expect from movies about serial killers, which are more often designed for sensationalism and exploitation than contemplation and reflection. Taking a novelistic approach to the subject, screenwriter James Vanderbilt gives the drama room to breathe, allowing detail to pile upon detail, and providing an array of characters who disappear from the drama for long periods of time only to return to center stage when called upon to do so by the facts of the case.The drawback in such a strategy is that the movie occasionally feels aimless and formless, as it ricochets back and forth between plot strands and characters that often seem at cross purposes to one another. But the distinct advantage of this approach is that the movie feels less contrived and artificial and more akin to real life, as it captures the sometimes decidedly unglamorous nature and frustratingly plodding pace of actual crime detection. And for those who might be hesitant to watch the film due strictly to its subject matter, it should be noted that, for a movie on such a grisly topic, ""Zodiac"" is surprisingly tame in the blood-and-guts department (thank goodness).Indeed, the movie gets its unnerving murder scenes out of the way right up front, so it can turn its full attention to its real areas of interest: chronicling the behind-the-scenes search for the killer and exploring the psychological impact this search has on three men who become, to varying degrees, obsessed with the case. Jake Gyllenhaal, who hit a career high water mark in 2005 with ""Proof,"" ""Jarhead"" and, of course, ""Brokeback Mountain,"" continues his journey into edgy roles playing Graysmith, the rather nerdy cartoonist for the San Francisco Chronicle, who managed to get closer to unveiling the true identity of the killer than anyone else, and who went on to write of his experiences in the book, ""Zodiac Unmasked: The Identity of America's Most Elusive Serial Killer Revealed,"" on which the film itself is based. Graysmith was able to scoop even the lead investigator, David Toschi (sharply played by the always interesting Mark Ruffalo), who finds his life becoming ever more overtaken by the case the longer it drags on without resolution. The third major actor in the drama is Paul Avery, the crime beat reporter who turned to drink, thereby torpedoing his own career, after the killer singled him out as a potential target. It is the lack of screen time allotted to Avery that offers one of the genuine disappointments of the movie, especially as he is embodied by the brilliant Robert Downey Jr., whose own life experiences make him the perfect choice for the role.With its meticulously mounted, pitch-perfect recreation of the details of the case as well as the times in which they took place, ""Zodiac"" is one of the few films of recent years that can truly be termed a thinking man's thriller.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

"Tedious, Lifeless Presentation of Evidence & Dead Ends",This movie is not a thriller. It is not a suspense movie. It doesn't attempt to be a visceral experience.It tries to be a cerebral dissertation on the inability of man to solve a mystery; of the futile attempt of man to try and understand the world through the collection of facts.Then it cops out on its premise by presenting to us the probable killer.Almost 3 hours of a tedious lifeless presentation of evidence & dead ends -- and then the movie sells out its own intentions. If the movie had any guts it would have left the case unsolved. It would not have made this movie watchable but at least you could say that it was uncompromising.,1.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Peerless precision from Fincher.,"I have seen it written that this film shows that Fincher had grown up, and whilst I understand that train of thought, it simply isn't true. What Fincher has done is give a true story his meticulous care and standard deft precision by leaving no stone unturned. We get simply one of the (if not thee) best films to deal with the investigating process of a high profile serial killer, a film that as a character study is actually essential viewing in the pantheon of genre productions.The devilish greatness of this film is in the fact that it can't pay off with a pandering mainstream ending, the makers are telling a true story and any sort of research will lead viewers to the fact that there is no twist here, no joyous ticket selling round of applause at this ending, it is what it is, frustratingly brilliant. The case the film is about consumes all involved with it, and to see how it affects those involved is engrossing (yet sad) because if the viewer is so inclined to jump on board then it will consume you as well, the film and the actors within demand you see this for the affecting character piece it is.The acting here gives me hope that classic acting is alive and well in this generation, I was once not enamoured with Mark Ruffalo in his early days as an actor, but here he puts such heartfelt verve into the role of David Toschi I felt I need to send him a written apology!. Robert Downey Junior is joyous as Paul Avery, all 60s chic and swagger without tipping over the edge of the mountain caricature (both men to become future Avengers of course). Yet surprisingly to me I found that it is Jake Gyllenhaal as Robert Graysmith who is the film's key axis, the central heartbeat, with a performance that demands undivided attention, a performance brought about by Fincher's quest for perfection from everything to do with film making. Gyllenhaal hated working on the film, he hated Fincher's work ethic, but in time he must now look back and see that here the director coaxed out a performance that has in time been seen as not only great, but also beneficial to his career (hello Nightcrawler).This is not Se7en 2, and British film mags like Empire should have known better than to use that tag line to get the readers' attention, because fans of serial killer thrillers need not apply here, fans of outstanding cinema about the human psyche during the pursuit of a serial killer - Well get in line folks, for this is one of the best movies of the decade. 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
This is the Zodiac Speaking,"The movie is excellent, almost as good as Fight Club (and certainly much better Panic Room). The performances are solid as well. Most impressive--especially for someone who has read a lot about the Zodiac Killer and lived in the Bay Area, I was impressed with how the movie stuck to only the verifiable facts and didn't take much ""artistic license"" for the sake of making it more dramatic or Hollywood friendly (ala Oliver Stone). And David Fincher is a master at filming these precisions scenes that really capture the environment and unease. The soundtrack is excellent too, although it's a shame that all the songs are from that period because something like ""This is the Zodiac Speaking"" by Pleasure Forever would be an obvious choice to be included.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
The Most Dangerous Game,"Fincher's 'Zodiac' is an engaging suspense thriller. David Fincher is known for creating a strange unique dark atmosphere in his films and here too he does that in a 60's setting. Another strong point of his films, is the technical brilliance. Thus, in 'Zodiac' too the composition of the frightening cinematography, background score, sound effects, lighting and visuals is outstanding. Unlike his other films, here Fincher relies more on subtlety and silence creating a quiet chilling darkness.I don't know much about the Zodiac case except that it remained unsolved. Many have commented that 'Zodiac' very much stays true to the facts. One may wonder why make a movie on an unsolved case but 'Zodiac' isn't a whodunnit (we never now that but there are strong suggestive hints), a howdunnit (this is already shown) or a whydunnit. It revolves around three people, a detective, a reporter and a cartoonist, all of whom were drawn to the case and the movie shows their involvement and how the case influenced them. I liked how Fincher portrayed Robert's fascination for the Zodiac murders. Why was it that Paul lost interest, Dave lost hope but Robert remained drawn to this particular case?Casting is spot on. Gyllenhaal is decent. His acting isn't that different from his other works but that doesn't take away from his character. Robert Downey Jr's performance is natural and he provides some awesome comic relief. Mark Ruffalo and Anthony Edwards fit the bill. John Carroll Lynch is good. The women don't have much to do but Chloë Sevigny and Clea Duvall make the best of what they're given and they shine.While I don't think 'Zodiac' ranks among Fincher's best, it still is a very good movie. An atmospheric suspense thriller and a fine study of three characters. Strongly recommended.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Movie Is Just Creepy Enough,"An often overlooked movie from the 2007 season is Zodiac. Directed by David Fincher, he directed Se7en, right off the bat we know that we are gonna have the creeps. Fincher had to be careful with this subject matter. He didn't have to finesse the treatment of violence or ratings board but rather the fact that there are so many Zodiac experts and fanatics. There are tons of books and loads of information in the marketplace about the real life 1970s killer in San Francisco. The movie examines a series of murders that started in July 1969 and letters to local newspapers in San Francisco that followed. The letter writer included a separate cryptic cipher to each of the three newspapers and told them to print the letters or he would go on a killing spree. Director David Fincher also focuses on the lives of San Francisco Chronicle crime columnist Paul Avery (Robert Downey Jr.), political cartoonist Robert Graysmith (Jake Gyllenhaal), and police inspectors David Toschi (Mark Ruffalo) and Bill Armstrong (Anthony Edwards). Based on the book by Robert Graysmith himself, the film focuses primarily on Graysmith, but also involves the others who became too involved for their own good: Avery, Toschi, and even Graysmith himself. I liked Zodiac a lot but I understand why it did not make too many best of the year lists. The film is a little tedious and runs long. Now if you're a Zodiac nut the film may not be long enough and if you're just a peripheral nut, like me, then it's just right.  As for the poster, there are two good versions of maybe the 4 offered. The one with the taxi and the one with the fog covered Golden Gate Bridge are both creepy enough to capture just the right feeling for the film.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

"""Zodiac"" is of the rarest-and dying-type of Hollywood thriller","Exhilarating, unshakable, mesmerizing, baffling, and adept beyond belief, David Fincher's Zodiac neither lacks ambition or audacity. Combining all aspects of Fincher's works from his cynical Se7en to his brilliant Fight Club, Zodiac is of the rarest --and dying-- kind of Hollywood thrillers, both simplistically alive and meticulously astute.Shot on state-of-the-art HD by Harris Savides via a process that required absolutely no celluloid or tape, Zodiac gives off somewhat of a rich, smoky feel, often felt as if it were shot with a Mini DV. This also gives a feel of realism towards a film that is not supposed to be interpreted that way at all. Such a toned-down aesthetic (full of fades to black) is matched by David Shire's taut score and the director's conspicuously reserved camera work, which favors both masterful crane-shots and visual close-ups giving the audience it's grab towards emotion.Although Zodiac looks like the average, done-deal, it truly isn't. Mixed with stunning casting (especially Ruffalo, who finally proves himself), a beautiful chronology that never seems to slog the film's pace, and a feeling of overall realism, Zodiac really is a director at the top of his game. The film is in its own world, unique in its own ways, but also glares a sense of naturalism. Zodiac embeddes the beauty of itself in our minds, creating a stark, unforgettable journey that truly must be seen to be believed.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

Well done true crime flick,"David Fincher really made his mark 12 years ago with the excellent 'Seven'. Since then, however, he's been disappointing - Fight Club was massively overrated, while The Game and Panic Room were both merely decent thrillers - but it would seem that Fincher is (nearly) back to his best with Zodiac - a sprawling epic mystery/crime thriller based around a real life unsolved crime. This is no doubt a very ambitious film - it doesn't quite work as a rounded whole - for a start, the characters don't really get time to develop well - but all in all, Zodiac is certainly a very good film. The film is based on books by Robert Graysmith and follows the events surrounding the Zodiac, an anonymous killer who murdered several people in the late sixties and early seventies. The film follows reporters and police officers as they investigate the Zodiac killings and endeavour to find out the identity of the killer. Eventually, the protagonists end up becoming obsessed with this investigation and the Zodiac consumes them...The film is extremely well put together as you would expect, and Fincher has done an excellent job of recreating the time period in which the film is set. As the story spans over several years, the film does tend to make jumps from one time to another often, and this means that the characters and their personal situations have to take a backseat to the investigation, which is the backbone of the film. This is the way that the film has to be otherwise it would have ended up going on for several hours...but it does mean that the film doesn't feel like a complete whole. Zodiac is lead by three good central performances, Jake Gyllenhaal never really looked 'obsessed' to me, but at least he's an engaging lead. Mark Ruffalo was an odd choice for the police officer role, but it seems to be the right choice - and the film is topped off by Robert Downey Jnr, who gives yet another memorable performance. The mystery itself was enough to keep me interested, the ending was always going to be disappointing, but the film does manage closure in spite of the real life details of the case. Overall, Zodiac falls short of being a masterpiece; but it's certainly a very good thriller and it comes recommended.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
A Great Warm Up For Mindhunter,"David Fincher's Zodiac is a good look at the infamous, unsolved serial killer case. The Zodiac killings of the 1960's has still never been solved so you understand going to be unresolved. The film follows reporters and police in the San Francisco area as the case unfolds in their attempt to identify the killer. Fincher does a great job in painting a picture of the times-something he does very well. He also does a great job of painting a phot of the disconnect between police departments at the time, which seriously impacted investigations like this and the Golden State Killer case-solved in the 21st Century. The case precedes the work of the FBI in his great series, Mindhunter. The acting by Mark Ruffalo, Jake Gyllenhall, Robert Downey Jr, and others is really very good.

"""Zodiac"" kicks ass-trology!","Zodiac is a real Gem-ini of a movie. Pisces of it reminded me of the great 70s crime thrillers. I wasn't keeping Scor-pio, but I caught several references to 70s classics like ""Bullitt"", ""Starsky & Hutch"", ""Scooby-Doo"" and a Slinkee commercial.This is not a horror(-scope) flick. ""Zodiac"" doesn't have much gore, so you might want to Libra your expectations at home.

In that respect, the mood reminded me of Oliver Stone's slow paced thriller ""Talk Radio"", or the conspiracy mystery ""The China Syndrome"". There isn't a lot of action, but rather, the appeal of the film is the way we feel almost suffocated by a thick Aries of suspense.I guess you could say it's an Aquard-ius taste. Director David Fincher's is noTaurius for hitting us with disturbing, grisly material like in his 1995 masterpiece ""Se7en"". While not quite as ghastly as that, ""Zodiac"" is still a nice throwback to Fincher's earLeo works.So my only warning is: don't expect a heart pounding screamer like ""Se7en"".

Another masterpiece from Fincher,"Zodiac is an intriguing film, based on a true story about a notorious serial killer in California during the 1960s and 1970s, who fashioned for himself the name ""Zodiac"". The film truly gives us a realistic view into how the serial killer terrorized the San Francisco bay area and how people reacted. The film mostly revolves around the political cartoonist Robert Graysmith, solving the mystery of Zodiac's identity becomes an obsession for him.The acting in Zodiac is impeccable, it's packed with great actors. Gyllenhaal truly manages to capture the soul of Robert Graysmith, and I would say that this is one of his best performances, while Robert Downey Jr and Mark Ruffalo are also at their best.The script is so well written that you would think you are seeing real life footage from back then. Moreover, Fincher as always, creates the perfect atmosphere, from lighting to music. For instance, the soundtrack really gives that 1960s/1970s feel to it. Fincher's directing style is apparent throughout the film, and like each of his films this is also unique.Zodiac might be about a psychotic serial killer, but don't expect to see a very violent and scary horror film. There are a few scene that might send chills down your spine, but overall it's nothing like Se7en. Fincher could easily have made a gory film with the killer as the protagonist, but instead he made a complex and ambitious movie, with obsession as the ""protagonist"". The bottom line is that ""Zodiac"" is an amazing film that is not only entertaining, but is also a reminder of how each one of us can get carried away with a mystery.

The quintessential Fincher crime thriller,"David Fincher's signature filmmaking style is what sets 'Zodiac' apart from the average crime thriller. The journey back to the 60s to watch the cat-and-mouse chase between journalists, detectives and an evasive serial killer is one that is both unsettling and enthralling, as we see evidence slowly pieced together over the course of many years.Aside from the source material, which is rich, the acting performances are what make 'Zodiac' what it is. From Jake Gyllenhaal's San Francisco Chronicle cartoonist-turned-amateur detective to RDJ's eccentric beat reporter (a pre-Tony Stark RDJ, at that) and Mark Ruffalo's self-defeatist SFPD inspector, we get to follow the psychological impact of an incredibly difficult case, which plays mind tricks on each of our main characters in different ways.While top-tier acting is a crucial element of 'Zodiac,' a lot of its strength comes from the way it's filmed. Scenes that feature illuminating information that cause a shift in direction, or perspective, are plenty - some of which are enough to send chills down your spine. The soundtrack is also responsible for upping the chill factor.'Zodiac' is an example of a well-done take on a ripped-from-the-headlines story that still feels fresh and new.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

Zodiac,"I think it would be helpful before viewing this movie to have read Mr. Graysmith's two books chronicling the attempted detection of an allusive almost, at times, invisible sadistic serial killer. Mr. Fincher's intention is to purposely and deliberatley inundate you with facts, figures, and theories to tease the brain and give the audience the exact schizophrenic fact-finding frame of mind the real-life detectives had while tracking the thousands of suspects, the myriad of letters and copycat letters, basically, a forest of information that left them completely confused and bewildered as to detecting the real identity of Zodiac. In Mr. Graysmith's book, he basically leads the reader to believe that all the evidenece combined pinpoints to Arthur Leigh Allen, most of the evidence is circumstantial, but certainly compelling. And if Zodiac didn't kill in obscure jurisdictional boundaries throughout California, maybe the evidence would have been even more certain. I'm suspecting that this move is going to focus and highlight a lot of the mass confusion, paranoia, and anxiety during Zodiac multi-decade reign of terror. What we also have to realize is that this movie is based on real events. This is not a elaborate visual stunning fiction, like Fight Club, Panic Room, The Game, and Se7en, so there is definitely going to be more emphasis on complicated plot lines to capture the effect of the multiple perspectives that plagued the Zodiac hunt. I'll expect multiple plots, sub-plots, and thematic/character complications, not in a bad way, that dazzle the mind and force you to think about this movie as a detective searching for a serial killer might. I expect to become absolutely hypnotized by the plot, and the usual dank dark visuals from Mr. Fincher. Can't wait to see it, going tonight.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
"David Fincher's best film to date, a masterpiece.","I was hyped for this film from the get-go. After too many Fincher-less years finally we were gonna get a new film from him. Not only that but a two and a half hour long film about the Zodiac killer! HELL YES! Well, opening day I walked in, sat down and for the next few hours I was mesmerized. The opening murder sent a chill down my spine and after that I was hooked. The cast is phenomenal, with Robert Downey JR. back in shape giving a performance that's both comic and tragic. Jake Gyllenhaal was great but extra special props go to Mark Ruffalo for his amazing portrayal of inspector Dave Toschi.Yes, I have seen Fight Club at least ten times and I'm a fan. Have been for years. Zodiac is simply the better film. It has a greater plot, better cast and it's easier to re-watch because every time you notice something new. I must've watched it 20 times, including the three times I saw it at the theater. The fact that it was snubbed by the academy is a down-right shame. A sin, in fact. One thing I noticed while watching this film is that it has the characteristics of a classic thriller, that sense of storytelling over flashy effects and the atmosphere all added up to a feeling that you normally get watching a great 1960's thriller. Some even brought me back to the black and white era, especially the scenes at the Chronicle. They don't make 'em like this anymore? Apparently they do.This is a film that needs to be seen more than once. Take for instance, the scene at the beginning where the couple is attacked on the 4th of July, watching it again makes you appreciate what Fincher accomplished with this scene alone. Hurdy Gurdy Man comes on the radio and they don't know it, but before that song is over one of them will be dead and the other severely injured, his life changed forever.This is one the three best films of 2007, the other of course being No Country for Old Men and There Will Be Blood. I can't make up between this one and There Will Be Blood but it's better than No Country. Not by a lot mind you!When all is said and done, do NOT miss this film. Rent it, buy it, love it or hate it but see it at least once. Chances are you won't regret it.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Fantastic Crime Story!,"Hollywood just doesn't make as many compelling dramas like this as they should. Zodiac was well worth the wait, and I'm glad David Fincher took his time with this one. Everything worked-production design,wardrobe,music. In fact, you might think you're watching a movie from the late 60's-70's. The acting was phenomenal, especially Mark Ruffalo and Robert Downey Jr.s performances. They both deserve Oscar nods. But most importantly, you feel like you're part of the investigation, working with these people through every lead, dead-end, obsession, and hope. By the time the credits roll, you'll feel just as drained as these men probably did. And it's definitely not because of the film's length. I was enthralled in this crime saga from start to finish. One of the best of 2007 without a doubt.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
A Little Too Realistic,"I just finished watching Zodiac for the first time. As a fan of Fincher's other mystery films and the cast, I was thoroughly excited to watch it. Without saying too much, I was very entertained by the film up until the very inconclusive ending. I was a little let down, but can empathize with Fincher, as this film is one of the few that are actually factual and based on true stories without embellishment. The ending for me bumped it down from an 8/9 to a 7.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Only after enduring almost 3 hrs was I able to understand the necessary length,"Only after enduring the 2 hrs and 40 odd minutes director David Fincher took to unravel Zodiac was I able to understand the necessary length. It shared with the audience the feelings of frustration, anticipation, helplessness, fear and need for closure, which does not always happen.Jake Gyllenhaal turns in another sparkling performance as Robert Graysmith, newspaper cartoonist and later obsessive author of the book on which the movie is based. Mark Ruffalo uglies up his mug to convincingly play David Toschi, one of the inspectors assigned to the case. Robert Downey Jr. is in his element as the charming rogue journalist Paul Avery, who covers the Zodiac killer's beat on the paper. John Carroll Lynch very eerily plays suspected Zodiac killer Arthur Leigh Allen.Things don't always make sense but that is the ugly, unedited truth of murder of this serial variety, especially seeing it in context, in this age of hi-tech CSI-type shows. This movie shows not only how the deaths affect the victims' families but also how dangerous obsessions on such cases, while not exactly original (Black Dahlia, etc.) can consume even bystanders and those not directly involved.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Tries to condense over 30 years of history with no definite ending,"Zodiac is an ambitious film. It tries to condense over 30 years of history with no definite ending into one cohesive movie.

Don't be fooled by the rating,"I am writing this in the hopes of saving at least one person from throwing away $8.50. If you want to know the story of the Zodiac killer, read an article online; or better yet, read a book. I assure you, you can finish a comprehensive book in nearly the same amount of time it takes to watch this debacle of a film.The acting is superb. Downey, Jr. and Gillenhall do a fantastic job of recreating the emotion that the investigators must have felt in pursuit of this brainy killer. This, however, is where the compliment ends. At 2 hours and 40 minutes, the average movie-goes, like myself, expects ample action and fantastic twists. Movies can be this long and effective. Unfortunately, Zodiac has far too few interesting turning points and suspenseful moments. At one point, my two friends who were joining me, who are the average movie enthusiasts, were sound asleep. People left the theater early, I even heard several sighs as the plot NEVER got any more interesting.I will admit, the end is acceptable. They finally tie all the loose ends together.

Engaging and Intriguing,"A serial killer in the San Francisco Bay Area taunts police with his letters and cryptic messages. We follow the investigators and reporters in this lightly fictionalized account of the true 1970's case as they search for the murderer, becoming obsessed with the case. Based on Robert Graysmith's book, the movie's focus is the lives and careers of the detectives and newspaper people.When there's a movie that is 158 minutes long shown to be a slasher film rather than a detective mystery, people are most likely not going to see it. The trailer looks like it's setting a movie for 16 year olds, who are expecting a slasher but end up hating it because it was something different and the people who loved to see these movies don't watch it because they'll think (when they are watching the trailer), ""Oh, not another slasher movie,"" which is why, I think, Zodiac didn't make a lot of money in the box office.Well, I liked ""Se7en"" a lot and I like David Fincher movies (who doesn't?). It wasn't a surprise that I loved this movie and I will call this one of the best movies of this year, beating Fincher's other detective movie. It's no doubt that this is Fincher's most mature and best work he has conceived, so far.Being a 158 minute movie, I was surprised I didn't find this movie boring. I thought at least one point in the movie, it was going to be slow and a bit too long but it wasn't. Well, maybe it is a bit too long but I was still engaged and intrigued. This thriller isn't very out there with its storytelling but it works by the dialog and tense and suspenseful scenes, which had no music to play in the background.The killing scenes are great, but there aren't many. Like I said, it's not a slasher film. When watching this movie, you'll get pulled inside, like you're, yourself, a detective on this case and that you are trying to solve it, too. I also love the look of the film, being as the movie takes place around 1969-1976, if I remember.No, this film doesn't have car chases. This movie doesn't have shootouts. This movie doesn't trick the audience with the usual ""twist"" ending. This makes the film authentic and not like other movies. The performances in here are subtle, and not really fantastic, which I really do not mind.Zodiac is frightening and suspenseful at times, but the best thing about it is that it alludes and intrigues, the viewer. It doesn't cheat them nor will makes them disappointed. Fans of ""Se7en"", or David Fincher, must see this.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
David Fincher's Zodiac...,"David Fincher, although having made few films, is clearly proving to the film world that he is one of the elite directors in recent history. His new film, Zodiac, is just another example of Fincher's genius. The beginning of the film starts out with the initial murder, and it is very creepy, and VERY realistic. Right off the bat, the viewer can get a good idea about how the film is going to play out. It is very dark and very mysterious. The first hour of the movie moves very quickly with witty and intriguing dialog that keeps the viewer anxious to see how the events work themselves out.All of the actors, especially Mark Ruffalo and Robert Downey Jr., are phenomenal. And you can't forget about Jake Gyllenhaal, who I believe is one of the more underrated actors of today. Brian Cox, Elias Koteas, and even Donal Logue are very good as well.Also, even though it has a long 2 hour and 40 minute running time, it moves quickly and it barely feels as long as it truly is. This is mostly due to the great script by James Vanderbilt's script. It knows it's characters, and it figures out a way to get into the characters' heads without making it over-dramatic or corny.Lastly, The main factor that holds this film together is Fincher's directing. Obviously he is a good director, and going into the film I knew I would be in for something interesting. It was clear at most times that Fincher picked his shots out very precisely, enhancing the film's mood and keeping the film interesting throughout. Some scenes were so well-done it was haunting, especially the murder scenes. Even though the characters are on-screen for such little time, you feel for them and even cringe when they face their fates at the hand of the Zodiac.The soundtrack also deserves a lot of praise, for it keeps the nostalgic feeling of the 70's present while adding tension to some scenes that didn't even necessarily need the music in the first place.The only flaw of the movie is that at times it becomes a bit repetitive, but that is part of it's magic. The mix of the script, directing, and editing, does not even make the viewer realize this fact. But when it is evident, it is clear that the repetition is intentional to enhance the sense of obsession most of the character's feel.David Fincher's Zodiac is a very intriguing film that manages to make the viewer become more obsessed with the outcome of the film as the main characters become more obsessed with the case. All in all, it is a very mysterious, edge-of-your-seat thriller that is worthy of multiple viewings and is a must see not only for fans of Fincher, but fans of film in general.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
A solid film with some eerie good bits,The fact this film is based on true events gives it a boost in ratings already but effectively this is a hunt to find someone who is glorified in what he is doing.

A good police procedural but a poor psychological study,"The Zodiac was a serial killer active in San Francisco during the early 1970's. Unlike others of his kind, the Zodiac loved publicity and courted it religiously. He sent letters and coded messages to newspapers and police. During one killing he wore a complicated hood and cloak costume with his zodiac symbol emblazoned on the front. Another murder was done simply for the press and to tweak the cops. Horribly he got away with all this. The Zodiac killer was never caught. Because of this Zodiac the movie combines a police procedural with a study of the psychological effects the fruitless search had on its participants.Zodiac tries to concentrates on two individuals, Robert Graysmith, a political cartoonist who becomes obsessed with the killer and David Toschi, one of the cops assigned to the case. To appreciate the psychological toll obsession takes you have to come to know its victims. Despite the movie's long running time we never get that close to Graysmith or Toschi. Part of this is the actors fault. As Graysmith Jake Gyllenhaal is a cipher. He never seems any more than an amiable young man and his inner life remains something to be guessed at. Mark Ruffalo, as Toschi, is a better actor than his compatriot but his part is written as standard TV cop fare. Toschi resembles an amusing Columbo clone rather than a real cop with twenty five years experience. Another hindrance in understanding these two is that we simply don't spend enough time with them. Zodiac must have a hundred speaking roles with an array of secondary characters that easily outshine the leads. Robert Downy plays Roger Avery, a reporter assigned to the Zodiac case, as a smart-alec hipster undone by the '70's drug culture. Brian Cox plays flamboyant criminal lawyer and part time actor Melvin Belli for all the parts worth, which is about every stick of scenery within his reach. As a suspect John Carroll Lynch seems normal but just creepy enough to give one pause. Charles Fleischer outdoes Lynch on the creepy scale as a source who may be more than he seems. These characters flit in an out as the case rises and falls, all drawing attention away from Gyllenhaal and Ruffalo. It becomes increasingly clear is that Zodiac isn't really interested in their characters. The movie would much rather dwell on the search for and identification of the Zodiac Killer.It is as a police procedural that Zodiac shines. The facts of the case are clearly, almost lovingly delineated. Or, more accurately, Zodiac gives a very complete illusion of delineation. For Zodiac is compelled to give us the killer in a famously unsolved case. Yes, this is the suspect Graysmith and many of those involved with the case truly believe to be the killer and Zodiac is careful to point out the evidence presented is circumstantial. There can be, however, a huge gulf between what a movie pays lip service to and what it implies dramatically.It must be remembered that Zodiac is based on a book by a man whose psychological health depended on finding the killer. A multi-million dollar movie also has a need for closure. A police procedural needs a conclusion to proceed to. Otherwise you leave your audience frustrated and a frustrated audience is a small, unprofitable audience. Bear that in mind as you watch Zodiac. As informative as the movie is, distrust its conclusions. The real Zodiac was never caught. No one was prosecuted. Everything else is, at best, informed conjecture. Keeps this thought close and you will find Zodiac fine, thought provoking entertainment.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
The unsolved mystery of the serial killer Zodiac,"Zodiac (2007) :
Brief Review -The unsolved mystery of the serial killer Zodiac. David Fincher's obsession with confusing murder mysteries continues with Zodiac, and that's to our benefit. It doesn't matter how long this film is; it keeps you hooked throughout the narrative, and that's all that matters here. It's a basic and essential element in any murder mystery, and Zodiac never loses a moment of attention. It's not overly confusing either. It's the intricate structure of the story and, more importantly, the characters who behave peculiarly. The characters seem desperate at times and disturbed at others, which leaves you pondering their unclear mindsets and motives. Some characters, events, and questions are repeated for the sake of recounting and rechecking, and every time we discover something new, there are no definitive answers. The film is about the serial killer Zodiac, who first sends letters and informs about the crime he is going to commit. Later, he commits the crime, and he does it brutally, leaving everyone in fear. Despite his open warning, the cops are unable to catch him. A cartoonist becomes interested in this case, and a few years later, he becomes obsessed with it. So obsessed that he even loses his job, wife, and kids. In the end, he gets close to solving it, but it is of no use because he fails to gather enough evidence. ""I can't prove it,"" says the cop to him, and he replies, ""That doesn't mean it's not true."" That is reality sometimes. More than ciphers and Zodiac codes, this film is about this ultimate fact of life that changes many things around you. Fincher's grasp over the narrative is terrific, and the performances by all the actors are superb. The climax may be a little disappointing for you since you don't get a definite ending after spending 160 minutes on the murder mystery. But that can't be blamed since it accurately matches the real events. Overall, a very nice thriller for Fincher and genre fans.RATING - 7/10*By - #samthebestest.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
An okay film for a better story,"For as much as I appreciate the effort in keeping the storyline sober and factual, the movie does lack the rhythm, pause and intimacy a 160 minute thriller should be having, not to mention the characters never quite get where they should be going.I would have loved to watch a film that gets progressively dark and tense, while constructing an atmosphere appropriate for its time and events that is as well, reflected in the dialogue.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

Very hard to like...,"I think this film went overboard on authenticity with regard to culture of the 70's, right down to oppressive aspects of general thinking of that time and lack of openness. Had a really hard time liking any of the characters or caring what happened to them and there seemed to be a failed attempt to weave quirkiness into Gyllenhall's and Ruffalo's character that never really left the ground. (eg. animal crackers, etc.) Delivery was very flat and uninteresting, not to mention obvious mistakes/gaps in investigation that any ardent CSI viewer would pick up on in a flash. (ie. the guys aviation boots, shoe size. Relying on eye witness testimony over forensic evidence AND the complete lack of communication between departments while a killer is on a spree was hard to imagine.) Also, cutting this guy loose without a tail or someone following him blew me away. This film gave me a headache. Robert Downey junior seemed tied up and struggling in a sludgy environment and skillfully brought some creativity and life to the story without taking it over, which he could have done without thinking. He seemed to realize that to cross that line would really illustrate how flat things were with rest of the cast. Each player seemed tied to the lowest common denominator of delivery and feared rising above it for the sake of continuity.",5.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
A Real-Life Mystery Of The Highest Order,"Every year, thousands of mystery plots are created by film, television, and literature for our ""viewing pleasure"". Many (dare I say most) of them are conceived from a murder scenario. In the case of ""Zodiac"", however, it seems as if the biggest mystery of them all was right under our noses all the time.For a basic plot summary, ""Zodiac"" tells the story of the Zodiac killer in California from the late 1960s-early 1970s. In the early stages of the case, police investigator David Toschi (Mark Ruffalo) and SF Chronicle journalist Paul Avery (Robert Downey Jr.) struggle to catch the letter- writing, cypher-creating homicidal killer. In the end, however, it ends up being low-on-the- totem-poll Chronicle cartoonist Robert Graysmith (Jake Gyllenhall) who puts all the pieces together...or does he?If you are a fan of action/adventure fare and like a lot of ""flash"" up on the big screen, please stay away from this movie. ""Zodiac"" is all about savoring the mystery, and thusly unfolds at pace that allows the thinking-viewing to do just that. Before seeing this movie, I had zero previous information about these murders (far, far before my time), so it was utterly fascinating to me to see the amount of time it took for everything to play out. At almost two and a half hours, viewers can't be looking at their watches or they will be missing the point.It would have been easy for ""Zodiac"" to come across as a B-movie cop drama, but I think that the presence of director David Fincher (""Se7en"", ""Fight Club"", ""The Social Network"", etc.) makes it into an all-time great. Fincher knows exactly how to walk the fine line of keeping a movie pretty much devoid of ""action"" (in the traditional blow/shoot-em-up Hollywood sense) from getting stale, and instead just continuing to build the tension with every scene.Thus, ""Zodiac"" is a film I can highly recommend to anyone who is a fan of mystery fare. The fact that it is based on real-life events makes it even more intriguing. Just make sure you go into the experience with the right mindset and with plenty of time to savor this kind of filmmaking. It truly is an underrated gem.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Zodiac thrills and chills with fear of the unknown to save 2007,"Zodiac is by far the best film of 2007. It has not been a dismal year for Hollywood with record box office collections all around, but quality wise it has taken a beating. Zodiac, even with good quality movies around, would have beaten them. So good is the direction that the maker almost successfully holds the viewers attention and keeps them at the edge of their seat without any violence and gore and that says a lot about how thrilling is the drama that is taking place on the screen.Zodiac is about the infamous zodiac killer of San Francisco in the late 60's and 70's. With the case still open in 2007 and no justice done, it would have been less gripping to concentrate on one of the famous suspect of the case. While keeping the killer unknown throughout the movie the director has concentrated his attention on the investigation and especially on the reporters of the daily newspaper 'san Francisco chronicles', to whom the killer used to send abstract letters (to other newspapers also) along with zodiac coded language at the daily's office, with a threat to print those letters in the next daily edition or the entire county would face his wrath with more killings. Only letter handwriting matching and fingerprints to hold the suspects along with many varied eyewitness accounts of there encounter with the zodiac killer, the police investigation was not going along smoothly. As the cult grows the panic and frustration starts gripping the investigators and the reporters who end up loosing everything for finding the killer, coming chillingly close to many suspects and the real one. Jake Gyllenhaal ( Broke back Mountain) as the cartoonist Robert Graysmith at the chronicles who remains involved in the case for almost four decades comes up with an ace performance. Robert Downey Jr. as the chronicles eccentric reporter Paul Avery who in his time while investigating the killer gets letters from the killer personally also comes up with a commendable performance along with Mark Ruffalo ( 13 going on 30 ) as the san Francesco police's chief investigation officer on the case. With dependable actors all around the director with no worries creates a chilling drama around the real facts of the killings and investigation. The film though chillingly real tends to loosen few nerves in the audience with use of good humor of the main characters during few serious sequences in the first half. But in the second half with police coming chillingly close to the 'real' killer and Graysmith's own maddening investigation grips and demands the audience's attention. The director successfully captures Robert Graysmith's fear and emotions while he personally investigates the killings to write a book chronicling the events surrounding the killings, as he becomes victim of the killers nerve-wrecking midnight calls at his home. With the killer remaining unknown throughout the film the audience is gripped by various emotions all along, with no respite after the movie ends.The movie remains in the audience's mind as the ending credits briefs them about the various progresses the investigation had made. The movie is definitely close to a masterpiece in the crime genre. All thumbs up.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

The number one thought that I got from this movie, is how much easier it must have been to be a killer before the technology of today.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
"Definitely worth another look, especially if you didn't like it the first time around","When Canadian Industrial band Skinny Puppy came out with their first album in 8 years, many fans embraced the music, but just as many seasoned veteran listeners greeted it with scorn. The overall complaint was that the band was merely cashing in on the anti-Bush bandwagon (circa 2004); others posited that it did not sound like the band they'd grown up listening to (circa the '80s and '90s). In other words, the group didn't meet expectations because they did something DIFFERENT, as opposed to what was EXPECTED. My conclusion, which also applies to David Fincher's sweeping epic ""Zodiac,"" is: change is inevitable with the passage of timeif you want ""the same old thing,"" go back and listen to it, or watch it, or whatever.That being said, my first viewing of ""Zodiac"" (during its theatrical run) left me feeling almost remarkably disappointed. I had been anticipating the film since I first heard about it (circa 2005), as it was based on one of my favorite true-crime cases, and directed by David Fincher, who had created some of my favorite films. If ever there was an ideal pairing (and Fincher had shown his skill with serial-killer thrillers in the classic ""Se7en""), this would be it. Yet as I sat in the theater, I was almost disappointed in Fincher's own self-administered stylistic restraint as the film went off in the direction of a character study mixed with police procedural. I liked it up until about 90 minutes in, and found the remainder of its 158-minute run time to be labored and unengagingright at the point where the tension should have been rebuilding. That, and I found that Mark Ruffalo and Jake Gyllenhaal, two up-and-comers, didn't possess the necessary chops to see the remainder of ""Zodiac"" through. After a 5 year gap, I was left somewhat bitter at what Fincher had (or hadn't) delivered.And now that I'm typing up a review, fresh off my second viewing (ah, the wonders of DVD!), I have to say my initial impressions have changed radically. (Of course, part of this is me confessing my own pro-Fincher slant.) There is an interesting generational dynamic at work in the ""Zodiac"" reviewsmany of the elder critics who rejected Fincher's previous films have showered the heaviest praise on this one. And it is highly likely to alienate the teens and twentysomethings (myself included) who watched ""Se7en"" at an impressionable age, and celebrate ""Fight Club"" with near-religious fervor. For Fincher, who has built his career on unusual and unsettling projects, ""Zodiac"" is really the closest he has come to ""normality,"" despite the subject matter.I kept thinking that the film would play better on the small screen, and sure enough, it does. Without the distractions often associated with theaters, home viewing becomes ""Zodiac""'s most fitting arena, a safe haven to soak up the volumes of detail present within this lengthy mystery. In addition to the near-relaxed style and sepia tones present, the other audience-limiting factor is the convoluted nature of the caseyes, ""Zodiac"" is a film that demands total concentration on the viewer's part, loaded with dates, places, and characters who pop up sporadically throughout the narrative. Fincher successfully condenses James Vanderbilt's screenplay (based on the book by Robert Graysmith, portrayed by Jake Gyllenhaal in the film) into something coherent, but only if you stay on your toes. ""Zodiac"" is admirably challenging in its effort to turn a mainstream film into a thinking (wo)man's piece.Fully engaged in the story, it's interesting to see Fincher's stylistic touches channeled in a manner contrary to the visual dazzle he's known for. First is the cast: comprised not of marquee names but real faces, actors like Ruffalo and Gyllenhaal (both usually associated with lighter fare) actually leave fitting impressions in remarkably human roles; ditto Anthony Edwards, Elias Koteas, and Donal Logue as policemen from three different jurisdictions. This lack of bankable names is quite daring, and the performances sell the film. Second: the subtle depiction of obsession present is cleverly displayedin any other film, Graysmith's relationship with his wife (Chloe Sevigny) would have been padded out into a subplot, but Fincher makes it a side note to the Zodiac hunt, thus eliminating potentially melodramatic filler. Similarly, Robert Downey Jr. (as SF Chronicle reporter Paul Avery) has an excellent scene (among many excellent scenes), wherein he tells the invigorated Graysmith to forget about the dormant case, something the audience may be agreeing with at that point. Gyllenhaal, who gives the material his best shot, ultimately keeps us anchored in his Everyman pursuit of truth, to a substantial, satisfying payoff (the film's final scene gave me chills).Is ""Zodiac"" the jewel in Fincher's celluloid crown? No. It is, for my taste, a very well-made film that will probably make its way onto my ""Best of 2007"" list and alienate a lot of the director's cult following. But I'll be the first to admit that stepping back and viewing the film as the logical progression of Fincher's diverse career will make it more satisfying and rewarding. If you were left cold by it before, give it another lookit might just surprise you the second time around.7.5 out of 10",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

Requires patience but there's definitely payoff,"An objectively well-made film with a terrific cast and excellent '70s mood, ""Zodiac"" bears out David Fincher's technical gifts and I'd recommend this to anyone; that said, I had the hardest time getting sucked in. It did happen eventually, but I really had to work for it. With so much of the film happening in a newsroom, I guess I was expecting something more like ""All the Presidents Men"", and I struggled with the first half.But then came a time jump and everything changed. We're in the '80s, everyone's resigned to leaving the case unsolved . . . Except Gyllenhaal. He can't let it go, and he personifies the obsessive nature of the story. Did not see it coming, but he ended up shouldering the film, and I was electrified once things focused on him.

"By not bringing what we were eagerly awaiting, David Fincher's sixth film is a true modern classic that is as important as Art as it is for exposing an indecipherable case","More than a crime thriller, the mature - and no less hypnotic - Zodiac is a film about people who are obsessed. In it, Jake Gyllenhaal (Brokeback Mountain) plays Robert Graysmith, a cartoonist for the San Francisco Chronicle who, fascinated by puzzles, begins to investigate the mystery of the Zodiac killer on his own. His research leads him to cross paths with the police officers assigned to the case, Dave Toschi (Mark Ruffalo) and Bill Armstrong (Anthony Edwards), and with crime reporter Paul Avery (Robert Downey Jr.) - each equally determined. To discover the identity of the killer. Graysmith's obsession bore fruit. He believes he has identified the maniac and has written about his experiences in two books, which serve as the basis for the film, Zodiac and Zodiac Unmasked: The Identity of Americas Most Elusive Serial Killer Revealed.Thus alternating the role of the film, David Fincher subtly changes the language throughout these acts, making changes in the camera, in the performance of the actors that evolve throughout the narrative, in the lighting and especially in the color palette. In the first act, the protagonist is Paul Averry, a crime reporter from one of the newspapers who receives an enigma and a threat from the Zodiac. Where the pace is slower, with light and yellow tones in the compositions of the scenes. Still in this first act, the characters are presented in their natural environment and how their different personalities will initially deal with the appearance of the serial killer in the city and in the local newspapers.In the second act, we accompany Dave Toschi, one of the investigators responsible for the case, we accompany him in his searches and in his interviews, so that the plot gains a little more intense rhythm and we are faced with the constant advances and failures of the character. In this act, the colors become darker, although still with traces of yellow, which represent the characters' still hope of solving the case. In the third act, the narrative becomes frenetic, following the stage of madness in which the character Robert Graysmith arrives, where the local newspaper cartoonist, who from the beginning sought to help solve the case, finds himself in a mad obsession with finding out the serial killer's identity, putting it over everything in his life, from his career, to his family. It is at this moment that we are faced with more tense scenes, with the most evident suspense, the desperation of the protagonist and of the public itself in getting answers in an environment in which, more than 10 years after the first crime of the Zodiac, no one is looking to solve the problem anymore. Case. We are then introduced to a more frantic camera, with a blue palette and colors, a colder color compared to the rest of the film, amplifying the atmosphere of fear and tension. It is in this act that we have the most suspenseful scene of the entire narrative, in which the director holds our attention, transports us to the fear and environment of the character, only to be disappointed again and the fear is just an unnecessary illusion, for the murderer was not actually found.It's scary to think about Zodiac. Not only because we have a frightening story told with absolute mastery, but especially because it is a true account of events never concluded in a concrete way; the Zodiac was never captured, and the police couldn't even identify the definitive suspect behind his letters, having only a few guesses - some stronger than others. For these reasons, watching the film causes great discomfort, knowing that the story we are following does not have an ending, that the Zodiac killer himself could be hiding somewhere; at one point in the film, he even mentions that he would like a good actor to play him in a supposed film adaptation of the events (at the time, Clint Eastwood's first Dirty Harry). That way, it would already be a sinister movie in its own right just by the nature of its events. It's even better when we have a master taking over the ship.Could be described as a cross between The Silence of the Lambs and All the President's Men, Zodiac benefits from this unusual mix thanks to David Fincher's absolute control. As obsessed with perfection as his protagonist, the director brings a fantastic reconstruction of the period and a fidelity to the most detailed characteristics of the case, from the sketch of the ""uniform"" of the murderer to the various media events that unfolded during the time, such as the Jim Dunbar's infamous TV show. It is an exquisite work by the entire production and costume design team, which maintains a realistic and at the same time expressionist aesthetic for all visual elements; the ""organized"" mess of the Chronicle's newsroom reflects the desperation and efforts of journalists, just as a projectionist's basement turns into a real dungeon thanks to our perception and the construction of the atmosphere of the environment.The approach in Zodiac is very different and this results in David Fincher's most mature film as a director. Fincher uses all his skill to create some of the most impactful moments of his career. The opening scene of the film, with the Zodiac attacking a couple in a car, is exceptional in its ability to slowly build tension: we follow the couple's dialogue as the presence of a stranger following them grows stronger. And its presence becomes noticed by the characters; and the photography work of the late Harris Savides is exquisite in keeping the environment dark enough that we don't see the killer's face, but well lit by the vehicle's headlights and the antagonist's flashlight.In Zodiac, Fincher makes use of ""jump scares"" a few times, but the film's intention is not just to give cheap scares. The film instead seeks to make the audience feel the idea of the unknown and the fear it causes, focusing on the premise that any stranger can be the killer. The film has one of the scariest movie scenes of all time and it involves no bloodshed just a dark damp basement, a creepy house and a brilliant casting choice in casting a spectacular Charles Fleischer (the man who made the voiced by Roger Rabbit in 1988) for the scene.Such ability to chill the viewer remains in the following scenes that reconstruct descriptions and accounts of the Zodiac's attacks. The first one surprises with its astonishing contrast: a couple enjoying a beautiful day at the lake, with a vivid color palette permeated by elements of nature such as flowers, grass and a blue sky... Until we see the Zodiac wearing an exaggeratedly black outfit and mask, giving the visual impression of having a detached element of the scene there, something that exacerbates the cruel act of violence that follows; and the absence of music, replaced by the distant birdsong and sounds of nature, only adds to the tremendous discomfort of the entire sequence. It is a perfect representation of Evil invading a serene environment.It's something that remains until the rest of the film, but especially during sequences that maintain this discomfort. We have the killer's attack on a woman driving on a highway (the silence and the fact that we never see the killer's face are determining factors) and the murder of a taxi driver, portrayed in a more stylistic way thanks to an elaborate sequence shot that follows the vehicle's path in a sensational plongée plane - and the big shock is that we don't know the killer is there until the moment he fires the gun at the driver. And even scenes without the presence of violence become sinister thanks to this driving, especially the anthological interview of the police with Arthur Leigh Allen (John Carroll Lynch), the strongest suspect of being the murderer, which becomes practically an exercise in investigation; since Fincher frames the faces in central planes that force the viewer to observe every detail of his cold expression during the responses.The scary scenes in the movie are amazing for the reality involved in them for the way you can feel yourself in situations like these. However, those moments are not all there is to the film, it is a ""procedural"" investigative film from beginning to end, but it is perhaps the best ""procedural"" film of all time. This element is something that the film addresses in a fascinating way through all of the interesting personalities we meet throughout the film as it creates this obsession in the viewer to discover the truth in the same way it creates the obsession that destroys the lives of our main characters. Yet we still have that sense of that fear that remains unknown in the shadows, that sense of days passing and the murderer not being discovered, the sense that the murderer is still free to go around and do what he wants. But what is perhaps the most fascinating aspect of the film is how emotional it still manages to be as it never becomes a faraway look at this investigation despite never forcing its hand on emotion. This creates the weight of a series of crimes that go years without having their culprit revealed and how this doubt inflicts suffering for years on many people. All because of a single disturbed man.Thus, for the breadth and quality of information transmitted, the film can be considered almost perfect, if it weren't for the fact that we are faced with 2 hours and 40 minutes, so the feature can become tiring, but it still manages to hold us. Attention until the last minute, by giving us the illusion that the serial killer will still be found, only to repeatedly disappoint the public, a factor that was mainly responsible for many complaints, but at the same time, kept the story more faithful to the Real facts. Precisely by not bringing what we were eagerly awaiting, David Fincher's sixth film is a true modern classic that is as important as Art as it is for exposing an indecipherable case, Zodiac is one of the golden gems in David Fincher's career.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

A Master-Class in Mystery,"As serial killer based thrillers go, this is one of the more meticulous and thoughtful pieces available. It relies not on the gory reenactments of the killings but more on the work process of those trying to ensnare the killer, creating a crime thriller up to its knees in intrigue and subtlety. The weaving and frustrating course of the investigation, and thusly the plot of the film, works brilliantly to emulate the elusive nature of its subject matter, the killer who was never caught and makes this one of the best directed films of all time. Using an atmospherically dismal San Francisco backdrop to really drive home the suspense and diligent attention to detail in the investigation work, Zodiac truly earns its reputation as one of the greatest crime thrillers of all time",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
David Fincher's Most Matured Film To Date.,"One of the finest mystery-thrillers you're ever going to come across, David Fincher's Zodiac is a masterwork of meticulous research, painstaking craftsmanship & precision detailing which approaches the police-procedural sub-genre in an incredibly authentic manner, plus the level of accuracy it manages to maintain with the real-life investigative process turns it into an instant classic right away.The story of Zodiac focuses on the manhunt for the notorious serial killer whose killing spree occurred around the San Francisco Bay Area during the late 1960s to early 1970s & who used the alias ""Zodiac"" in his letters to press, which also included ciphers. The film covers the life of investigators & reporters who become obsessed with the case in their search for the murderer.Directed by David Fincher, Zodiac presents the renowned filmmaker at the creative height of his illustrious film career & is amongst his finest works for the effort he puts into the smallest of details in order to keep the story as authentic to real life as possible is worthy of praise. Equally fascinating is James Vanderbilt's screenplay who does a stellar job in adapting the story from the non-fiction book it is based on.Coming to the technical aspects, production design team does a magnificent job in recreating the 1970s settings, Cinematography encapsulates the film with a dark ambiance, muted colour tones & perfect lighting, Editing is carried out so well that its 167 minutes of runtime is hardly felt, the film makes use of visual effects but it's rarely noticeable & the background score as well as songs used feel perfectly apt to its scenario.The cast comprises of Jake Gyllenhaal, Robert Downey Jr., Mark Ruffalo & others, and their work is impressive as expected. Gyllenhaal turns in a fantastic performance as Robert Graysmith, a cartoonist working at San Francisco Chronicle who becomes increasingly obsessed with the case of Zodiac killer, Downey Jr. plays crime reporter Paul Avery, while Mark Ruffalo is assigned the role of Dave Toschi; the lead investigator on the case.One thing I absolutely adore about Zodiac is that it presents its case to the viewers in the exact same manner it is presented to its characters & before you know it, you're already trying to connect the dots like Graysmith. There's no denying that it is a sinister film yet there's plenty of morbid humour to be found here, plus there's also one particular sequence where the tension is far more unbearable than imaginable & you'll know when you get there.On an overall scale, Zodiac is an aesthetic blend of quality direction, impeccable screenplay, perfect digital cinematography, clever editing, convincing performances & fitting score that also remains Fincher's most matured work to date. Despite being a long dialogue-driven story, it is able to lure the viewers in & keeps them transfixed on the screen throughout its runtime plus its emphasis on realism & accuracy to its timeline makes it all the more admirable.As informative as any documentary can be on the same subject matter, as entertaining as any big-screen spectacle is capable of despite its lack of action & precisely capturing the timeline its story is set in, especially when it comes to the technology that was available to the police, Zodiac is a cutting-edge example of its genre which presents David Fincher in prime form & isn't just one of the best films of its year, but is great enough to rank amongst the most accomplished works of 21st century cinema.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
the best of the best of the best,"Zodiac We have seen a lot of movies about cops, killers and Serial killers. And when I took the DVD of this movie I was expecting pretty much the same. But sometimes you do get something totally different from what you where expecting but in a good way, and Zodiac is an apt example of this theory.Remember Zodiac is a real story of an unsolved case in USA about a serial killer who called himself ""Zodiac"". Taking real stories are like walking on a string, it can easily become a boring endeavor if not taken a proper care off. And the talented David fincher who has directed some of the best thrillers in Hollywood like Seven, Fight club and Panic room sees to that we never get bored.There are many movies on serial killings but very few about the investigations. Zodiac is more on the process of investigations on finding the Serial killer. Never have I thought after watching ""Memoirs of a murder"" that I would see such an impressive movie on the investigation of a murder again, but Fincher has done it. Was spell bound and was totally engrossed with the investigation that after seeing the movie I wanted to crack some codes myself.The movie is about a serial killer who is obsessed with publicity, starts a series of murders with no clues or evidences, but sending a letter on the description of the murder to a popular daily. All the killings are well executed without any patterns which makes it a lot difficult for the police to come to a conclusion.A cartoonist Robert Graysmith(Jake Gyllenhaal) becomes so obsessed with the Zodiac that he decides to investigate and write a book on the Serial killer, after the police shuts the case. The movie is all about the investigations of Robert. Robert also gets assistance from the police officials who are also equally desperate to catch this maniac.The movie is done so naturally and some of the scenes do make u nail less. Like when Zodiac gives lift to a woman with a baby and when Robert goes to the house of a person who has some clue on Zodiac.The cinematography by Harris Savides was top notch and he brought in the 1960 feel with grace. The editing and Sound department elevates the movie into a new level.All the actors enacted their part with conviction especially Jake Gyllenhaal, who proves that his Gay cowboy enactment in Brokeback mountains was no flash in the pan, Mark Ruffalo as the cop was spell binding and Robert Downey JR. was a complete natural.On the whole, this is one of the best thrillers I have seen recently. David fincher proves once again his hold on the thriller genre. Outstanding Verdict  4.5/5",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Lacks something,"It was hard for me to know what to expect when i sat down to watch ""Zodiac"". The word beforehand ranged from ""very good"" to ""unbelievably slow and boring"". As usual the truth was somewhere between the extremes.""Zodiac"" has one major flaw and one major advantage. We can start with the advantage: the actors. It was a long time since i saw a movie with this kind of ensemble. It seems almost every face is instantly recognizable from movies and TV, and all performances are top-notch. I especially liked Mark Ruffalos cop and John Carroll Lynch as an unusually creepy suspect. Brian Cox is as usual excellent in one of the best scenes of the movie (the TV-scene).The major flaw in my opinion was the pacing. I acknowledge that it's a fairly complicated movie (although not so much as many have tried to claim) and that it encompasses a lot of time. While that may be true, there are still ways to make time fly a bit faster for the audience. In the beginning of the movie the pace was pretty good and the tension was high. But as the movie went on that seemed to bleed off. There are a few moments when the nerve returns in the end, but i still looked at my watch number of times in the last hour.The pacing problem might suggest that i didn't like ""Zodiac"". But that's not true at all. Rather it's a good movie that has a few flaws that keep it from being great. The pacing being the worst of those. It has definite qualities though. The acting was the first one i mentioned. The second is the scope of the movie, it's an ambitious project to show decades of police work with the intense beginning and the dreary and long investigation, long after the media interest has died down.In the end this won't make it into my favorite movies because of something i can't really put my finger on. This movie lacks something. While it has an interesting story, great acting and ambition, there is still something missing. It would be pretentious to call it ""heart"", but somehow that's the way it feels. David Fincher has always been a very competent but sometimes emotionally detached director. Sometimes that spills over and makes you care less about the movie than you would like to. That's unfortunately the feeling i got with ""Zodiac"".",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
"A fascinating true story , The pinnacle of quality film making.( A+ Movie) My Ratings 10/10","A spectacularly done detail-oriented true crime film that focuses on the case rather than the actual killer himself whilst keeping you hooked until the very end (and even afterwards, where you can find yourself researching about the Zodiac).",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
"Neatly executed, but useless story for film","I really have no idea what is so special about this one killer that it needs so many remakes and books about it? We get to see a lot of really fine actors and amazing actresses do what they're good at, but this is like watching a repeat of a story we all know too well (even if we don't, because we could make this one up ourselves!). You'll be watching this wondering how much it has cost, and why they wasted it on such a thin story.I did not have a problem with the duration, it was all done very well; the scenery, the sets, the sixties, seventies, eighties were all portrayed like only these guys can, and it's nice to see these actors perform so well, but it doesn't extend from that. I had a similar feeling after The Departed. Something too artificial and forced about it all. It just doesn't get to you as much as it's supposed to.Some movies I'd recommend instead, somewhat neglected, but actually more worth your time: ""Wolf Creek"", ""The Matador"", ""Blood Diamond"", heck, I'm sorry for those involved, but even ""Vacancy"" and ""Hot Fuzz"" were more exciting to watch than Zodiac. Or, if you can, please see the TV-series ""Dexter"". It blows away a movie like this in all aspects. Or even a series like ""24"". After seeing those, a cheap story-line like the one in Zodiac, completely pales in comparison.It then comes as no surprise that the high rating on IMDb is not appropriate. This shall go down in time, no doubt, as it doesn't belong in the Top 250. It honestly isn't worth more than a 6.2 rating here; The story seems to have no moral to it, it comes across as useless, the scenario is often too difficult, slow and uninteresting, and I blame those who created it for pretending not to know or see this. I'm certain they knew what they were filming wasn't very interesting. People get killed everywhere, under fascinating circumstances, and this is what you come up with?

The one we've been waiting for!,"David Fincher has secured his place in the first tier. The maestro drops his recognizable style, save a few remarkable exceptions, and focuses on performance and character. He allows some ugly muddy low light scenes that would send most perfectionists to the medicine cabinet. A little more light would of looked better, yes, but probably not as truthful to the actors and the ""vibe"" of the scene. The result is a 70's movie that looks and feels like a movie made in the seventies. Many people have tried to get that right and failed. Fincher pulls it off. He had help. The BEST cast in years. The list of developed, memorable characters is at least 20 deep, quite a feat even at two hours and whatever. And then there's the script...so good it makes me wanna puke. Smart, funny, crafted with great payoffs in every scene, at every turn.. except at the end, where closure would of made THIS movie unnecessary anyway. It's not about the poor sick creature that performed those murders, but his victims, all of them. Frightening. I suspect what was frightening for Fincher was turning his big moments over to the actors. As hard as they are to do, choreographed camera moves can be ""gotten right"". To get some of these scenes right (the interview of Lee at the factory) you need to catch lighting in a bottle. As great as the shot of The Pan Am bldg was, I keep thinking about Rufulo taking the tomatoes off his BLT. Bra-Efren-VO to all involved!",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Not particularly brilliant,"This was a veridical case so they say. It's more the story of the investigation of several murders done by a psychopath serial killer than a thriller about the murders themselves. After police having given up the investigation and closed the case without getting any solid evidence that would allow them to get to the murderer, a newspaper cartoonist becomes obsessed with the case and starts an investigation on his own account. This is the main feature of the movie sometimes a bit thrilling but most of the time rather dull and monotonous like a not very exciting investigation documentary report. I must confess I almost fell asleep a few times during it. A not exactly bad but not particularly brilliant movie",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
"Dull movie.  Dull, Dull, Dull.","Is there some kind of David Fincher fan club stuffing the ballot box here at IMDb with 10 ratings? This director can make a great film. This isn't it. Not even close.All these over-rated reviews can't save the movie from bombing at the box office It must infuriate all of those in the Fincher Fan Club that your crowned prince of darkness can't connect with the current cultural zeitgeist like he did so many years ago with Se7en (now THAT was a truly great film). Is the director being misjudged by the culture or is the director misjudging the culture. I say the latter. In any case, this movie doesn't seem to be resonating with a large audience. Why?Because it's a dull movie. Dull, Dull, Dull. You never get inside the characters' heads. You don't care about them. The actors performances are standard.

"I left my heart (and my sanity, marriage, career and social life) in San Francisco","Sometimes getting the best out of a film depends entirely on what setting you watch it in. Sit down on a Friday night with five of your mates after a paintball game, a fridge filled with beer and nine boxes of pizza on the coffee table and it's a dead cert that you will not enjoy Zodiac. It would seem too long, too talk-heavy and too dark and after less than an hour, the DVD would go sailing out of the machine and replaced with Blade 2. However, if you watch it alone at night with nobody else in the house, all the lights turned off and your phone switched off and you'll be in exactly the right place to appreciate it fully. And what an experience it is. Zodiac, while not the greatest film in director David Fincher's back catalogue (this is the man that directed Fight Club after all) is like a twenty-first century version of a classic film noir. The lighting is grim, the story slow paced, the male-centric cast obsessive and paranoid and by the time the deliberately ambiguous ending rolls around, your eyes will be gaping wide and you'll be lucky to sleep for a week.Based around the true life Zodiac case the film marks Fincher's return to the serial killer genre he previously did so memorably with Seven. No surprise then that there's a fair bit of expectation resting on it and your response to the movie inevitably depends on how familiar you are with his previous work. For one thing, the murders in this movie are not gory set pieces designed to get the blood hounds hot under the collar, but chillingly executed scenes of real-world horror. The pre-credits attack for instance is pure Fincher; awkward sexual tension hanging in the air as a young couple meet up for an illicit affair only to be stalked and set upon by a shadowy assailant who subsequently vanishes into thin air. Later this scene is echoed as a middle aged married couple are viciously slaughtered while lounging by a lake in broad daylight. Both sequences are tense and slow paced and the director's refusal to make them overly melodramatic adds to the sense of genuine brutality.Furthermore, Zodiac is one of the darkest films released last year and even scenes that take place in daylight have the oppressive feel of shadows moving in. While the investigation into the killer takes up a lot of the running time, the story is mainly focused on how three different lives are affected by the murders. Robert Graysmith (Jake Gyllenhall) is a newspaper cartoonist whose natural skill at code breaking and problem solving suckers him in when Zodiac starts sending cryptic messages to the San Francisco Chronicle. Paul Avery (Robert Downey Jr.) is one of the paper's most respected journalists who takes a very intense interest in the case. David Toschi (Mark Ruffalo) is the chief police inspector hunting the killer. Each one becomes affected in their own way as the story unfolds and before long, their private obsessions see marriages destroyed and careers ended, their day to day actions haunted by a constant sensation of hooded eyes watching their every move.Naturally, as this is all based on a genuine story there is an added dimension to it and to his eternal credit, Fincher hasn't backed down from his vision in order to please the studios. However, it also means that the killer's identity is never fully revealed, a fact that some will find incredibly brave but others will be frustrated by, especially after the bladder-challenging three hour running time. Of course the director couldn't come out and say clearly who it was but he makes it clear who he believes was responsible and one of the final scenes where Graysmith confronts the suspect with neither man saying more than a few words or indeed, doing anything about it is a classic example of how a few minutes of silence can speak volumes.Zodiac therefore is a film that rewards patience. It stretches on and on but every second is infused with detail and depth. For anyone with a serious interest in cinema as an art form, this one isn't to be missed but even those of you who are rolling your eyes thinking ""pretentious sod"" will find much it a rewarding experience, just be sure to book an entire evening off first as this isn't the kind of film you can just put on on a whim.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

Watch this movie! Really great!,"I love crime drama and thriller films and I would like to reviews two of those crime-drama / thriller films and it is really cool. The first one is going be the 2007 film, Zodiac, directed by David Fincher and then I will review the 2013 mystery movie, Prisoners, directed by Denis Villenuneve.Let's review ZODIAC.Zodiac tells the story of the manhunt for a notorious serial killer who called himself the ""Zodiac"" who killed in and around the San Fransisco Bay during the late 1960's and the early 1970's, leaving several victims in his wake and taunting police with letters, blood staining clothing and ciphers mailed to newspapers. The cases remain as Northern California's most famous unsolved crimes.David Fincher put together a very intense and suspenseful crime-drama / mystery film. I thought the acting was really amazing, our three main actors are really good, including Academy Award nominee Jake Gyllenhaal as Douglas Graysmith, who I thought was really great in his performance in this film. Mark Ruffalo, a.k.a. Bruce Banner / The Incredible Hulk in the Avengers movies and he plays inspector Dave Toschi, and he does such a great job. And also the man who plays Iron Man himself, Robert Downey Jr. as the role of crime reporter Paul Avery and he does really fantastic in this movie compared to him in Gothika, Iron Man, The Avengers and Tropic Thunder. The rest of cast was really amazing in the roles that they were in.The pacing and the screenplay was really amazing and so fantastic, but the run time for the film -- at 156 minutes long -- it is really long and it tends to drag in a few areas, but again it works for this kind of crime-drama film.The music by David Shire is really amazing and is really gritty and dark and they even add some old songs of the 1960's and the 1970's in the film's soundtrack and it sounds very awesome.The visuals in this film are just simply incredible they re-created the 1960's version of San Fransisco, California and I do love the costumes that the actors wear and the production design that this movie had, it was really great and the film's theatrical release poster was really creepy when I first saw it and it was so cool when I looked at the poster online and the DVD cover and it is a really cool film.I thought the ending was great, but David Fincher deserves a lot of credit for creating of the most memorable, critically acclaimed films of 2007 and that was a great thing. There is a director's cut of Zodiac on DVD and Blu-Ray Disc and to be honest, I have not seen the director's cut, but the original theatrical version was just amazing.Overall, I love ZODIAC. It's a great crime drama story that I had no problems with and I have no problem re-watching ZODIAC again and again. Sure, the movie may have strong and intense brutal killings and language in it, but it has a purpose for being in the movie, which I like.ZODIAC is a movie that needs to be seen by everyone, except for people who are very sensitive about what they watch. 8/10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

Inept.  No suspense.  No thrills.,"Zodiac is being sold as a suspense thriller but it has no suspense and no thrills. It's really more of a police procedural but as such it is just inept.One character is introduced as someone who may or may not have been an eyewitness having possibly ridden as a passenger in the Zodiac's car. Yet as soon as she is introduced, we never see her again in the movie. There are no scenes of her describing the Zodiac and how that description may or may not help the police investigation.There's another character who is introduced who's handwriting is the closest match to Zodiac's handwriting on the letters that have been received by the Examiner. Yet after only one scene in the movie that character is never seen again. Why didn't the Graysmith character follow that up?I'd like to think that in the real life case those two characters played a part in the Zodiac mystery. Yet in the movie they're chopped into the story and then dropped for no apparent reason.This is clunky story telling, plain and simple. The movie just doesn't work and I found it to be a frustrating bore.",1.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Possibly Fincher's best movie so far,"""Zodiac"" is a great movie about a highly intriguing killing spree that took place in the U.S.A. in the late 60's. Some moviegoers may have been under the impression that this is a movie in the vein of Fincher's ""Se7en"", but that is not the case. ""Zodiac"" is mainly a character study of the men who hunted the ""Zodiac"" killer. That's not to say that ""Zodiac"" isn't thrilling, but it's not your typical ""cops hunt maniac""-movie.The story is apparently very faithful to actual events. This goes all the way to the brutal killings, which are among the most realistic ever put to screen. Every time Zodiac appears it's spine chilling, whether you see how he kills in detail or just hear his creepy voice and see his victim's reaction.The murders are not in the spotlight, of the movie, though. It's the investigation of the crimes as the years pass by. The movie has a certain vintage look about it with brownish-colors and little light. The music picked is also very appropriate for the periods of time the movie depicts.More original than the ""Silence Of The Lambs""-clone ""Se7en"", less preaching than ""Fight Club"" and simply better than ""Alien 3"", ""The Game"" and ""Panic Room"", ""Zodiac"" is probably David Fincher's best movie so far and one of the few highlights of this summer.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Monstrous and Magistral: David Fincher's Zodiac Film Delivers on All Fronts,"If you're looking for a captivating movie and a high-flying realization, then don't miss this incredible work by David Fincher. Finding the filmmaker at such a level of mastery is an excellent surprise for cinephiles around the world.The historical reconstruction is so meticulous that it will transport you directly to the 60s and 70s. The casting is impeccable, with each performer making an essential contribution to the whole. The actors play with such precision that you will feel like you are part of the investigation, with the different sleuths trying to unravel an almost esoteric mystery.How can we not talk about the soundtrack that accompanies this film in a masterful way? The selected pieces are just incredible and enhance every scene.The film is an excellent thriller, but above all, it is a fascinating investigation. David Fincher manages to keep us on the edge of our seats for 2h30 without us even noticing, it's truly impressive.

Mystery of the Zodiac killer,"David Fincher manages to assemble some of the cast of The Avengers before Marvel Studios. Fincher again revisits the serial killer genre but this time based on true events of the Zodiac killer.The killings take place in the early part of the picture and although not graphic is still disturbing and eerie. The rest of the film deals with the police and press investigation in trying to unmask killer conveying the frustrating nature of the investigation that is still unsolved.The film gives us a narrative from the point of view of San Francisco Chronicle cartoonist Robert Graysmith who spent over 20 years obsessively trying to identify the killer and whose book the film takes inspiration from.The three leads Jake Gyllenhaal, Robert Downey Jr and Mark Ruffalo show zeal and frustration in equal measures as the exhaustive investigation over time places a burden on them all as they go round in circles with the evidence and suspects. The film believes that Robert Leigh Allen is the main suspect although the DNA case against him is unclear.The film is dense, thoughtful and at times seem slow. There is good photography and set design, showing San the Francisco of the late 1960s/early 1970s is not a simple task.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
ARTHUR LEIGH ALIEN³,"Reviewing any acknowledged classic by a revered director is pointless, but here we all are anywayWhen I was a kid, the BBC would fill the holes in their empty Summer schedules with cheap trash they'd picked up from the US - TV movies like the Gacy one starring Brian Dennehy, another about Ramirez, and one called The Preppie Murder, with Lara Flynn BoyleAlthough I enjoyed them, they were pretty artless things; functional retellings of the established facts with similar production values to Moonlighting or LA Law, but they were given extra value just by the fact the viewer knew they were telling a true storyZodiac feels like David Fincher watched those TV movies and thought WHAT IF SOMEONE TALENTED MADE ONE OF THOSE?In that, Zodiac reminds me of the way Kubrick took genres - war movies, horror movies, science fiction movies, and nineties erotic thrillers (proven, effective storytelling vehicles) - and saw what happened when you applied his sensibilities and exceptional level of craft to themOn the level of craft, Zodiac is pretty much unimpeachable. The recreation of the period - America's transition from Mad Men to All the President's Men - is absolutely note perfectThe electronic press kit for the movie included a sequence where a crew member spoke about the director sourcing ceiling lights that were the exact model used in the offices of The Chronicle - the kind of recessed units that are mostly hidden in the ceiling and which are only visible in one or two shots of the movieThat level of obsessive detail extends to every other aspect of the movie; from characters' clothing, to music and to the facts of the real life story the film is telling, tooBut the film understands that all those real world details we think we're remembering each time we resurrect our childhoods are interpolated with snippets from family photographs and pop cultureYour emotional memory of visiting the play park with your mother is real, but every time your brain gets to a physical detail it hasn't retained, it fills in the blank with a sweater you remember Meryl Streep wearing in Kramer vs KramerSo the director's reconstruction of his childhood and other people's lives is pieced together from fragments of pop culture. Dave Toschi dresses like Columbo, wears his gun like Bullit, and his partner is Jim Garrison from JFKBut as time passes, Toschi turns into Dave Starsky and his car becomes a Torino, complete with red roof lightToschi visits the cinema to watch Harry Callaghan murder Zodiac's fictional analogue, Scorpio, and when the camera sweeps across a fog-shrouded Golden Gate Bridge, the music cue reminds the viewer of Vertigo and Jimmy Stewart's attempts to piece together a dead woman from broken shards of memoryThat impossible shot of the bridge is also a great example of Zodiac's restrained and tasteful use of CGI, something other film makers could learn fromAnother impossible shot, sweeping over a period recreation of San Francisco waterfront, opens the movie and a fake time lapse video of the Transamerica Building being constructed is used to illustrate the passing of years between developments in the investigationThey're the kind of thing CGI does well and they're used sparinglyI don't know enough about the investigation to know whether the theories and suspects presented by the film are credible or not, but the way the facts are dramatised is expert and entertainingTwo key scenes - a female motorist's terrifying encounter on the freeway and the slow-building sense of unease during Graysmith's visit to the home of someone with a potential lead - are absolutely *terrifying*, maybe more so than the murders themselvesThat's all the more remarkable because nobody is harmed in either scene and, on reflection, the viewer realises they go nowhere and probably don't even relate to the Zodiac killer in any wayThey illustrate the power of false leads and dead ends to grip the imagination - which is what happens to Graysmith - and they're testament to the virtuosity of the director, his ability to expertly use the tools of cinema to immerse the viewer in the perspective of another person and make them feel, viscerally, what that character is experiencingWhich, ultimately, is what the entire film is doingIn telling a story that has no conclusion, the film makers realised they had to give shape and meaning to a series of facts that have none. So, for the duration of the movie, they use all the tools of movie storytelling to make you believe in what you're seeingThe recreations of the murders create tension and build the desire for the murderer to be caught. When those murders cease, tension's created from presenting red herrings as if they're murders and suspects are dangled before the viewer in a way that has them desperate for the investigators to find that crucial piece of evidence that will resolve the tension and put them in jailThe film makers give a random sequence of unrelated facts the shape of a story and create a villain out of the blank space left where all those assembled facts don't quite fit togetherThe final scene between Graysmith and Toschi, where the former outlines the final case for why he thinks his suspect is the killer - and the brilliant scene where Graysmith visits the store where his suspect works - are virtuoso examples of the film makers' ability to create something compelling out of absolutely nothingAs Toschi says, he's not Dirty Harry - he can't make a case out of coincidences and circumstantial evidence, but this film and its makers can, and they do so brilliantly...",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
A constellation of clues that may leave you bored with the puzzle,"The movie covers a period of over 30 years and the difficult quest to identify Zodiac, a serial killer. Early on in the film, the Lynchian (Blue Velvet) device of contrasting violence with gentle music erupts with Donovan's hippie ballad, Hurdy Gurdy Man. Only this Hurdy Gurdy man isn't singing songs of love. He is shooting, stabbing, playing catch-me-if-you can, and generally wearing the police down.The lack of a logical progression towards solving the crimes evokes a reality that the cinematography is also aiming at, sepia hues suggesting noir of an indeterminate era. It's claim to be based on actual case files rings reasonably true. There are echoes of Director David Fincher's earlier work, Seven, but without the luridness. The central character, Robert Graysmith, is based on a real person who wrote a number of books about the real serial killer.Graysmith (played by Jake Gyllenhaal) is a cartoonist at the San Francisco Chronicle. His hobby is solving puzzles. Zodiac, who sends cryptic clues to the newspapers, is his dream come true. Following the trail over more years than the police have patience for, Graysmith labours unrelentingly to find the identity of the killer.Gyllenhall is a strength and weakness. He has screen charisma, but maybe not enough to carry the whole movie. His character lacks the depth or maturity displayed by Mark Ruffalo as the weary Colombo-esquire cop or the top lawyer played by Brian Cox. The realism of the film is questioned by his home-boy appeal, even if we warm to it.Occasional special effects (such as a speeded up construction of a building) also jar. The symbolism seems too weak. Fans of double meanings may work many psychological references into the interplay of terrorizer and terrorized, but the film is overly long. I found myself eventually not really caring who the killer was. Only two or three scenes (a murder, a woman driving with her baby, and Graysmith coming out of the rain into a uncannily threatening house to dig up clues) have any tension. The rest left me less than gripped. Endless details, false leads, tenuous clues and waffling plot.¨Nobody has more Zodiac crap than you do,¨ exclaims Graysmith's long-suffering partner. And it seems the producers spared no expense cramming every drop of it into the film.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

Read the negative reviews before you waste your time,"Se7en and Fighclub are great movies. David Fincher's latest, Zodiac, has been getting great reviews. I couldn't wait to see the movie. About an hour or so into it, I couldn't wait for it to end. It really angered me. I kept thinking, how could so many critics love this? How come I'm hating it so much?The film doesn't look or feel like previous David Fincher films. I guess it's commendable that he's trying to do something different. The movie, though, isn't good. I'm convinced, that if he had used a pseudonym, the exact same movie would not have gotten the reviews that it did. David Fincher's reputation gives him some kind of pass from the majority of film critics. If the exact same movie was listed as being directed by someone like Gary Fleder the same critics would probably be calling this movie out for the long winded pointless choppy unemotional anti-thriller that it is.I've never seen a movie in which I so disagreed with the reviews that I had read. So I went back and instead of skimming the reviews for whether the reviewer liked it or not (the majority of reviewers did like the movie even if they thought it was too long), I read the details and later found a lot of negative reviews.Go to a site like rottentomatoes.com and read some of the negative reviews; even the favorable reviewers write things like ""overlong and lacking dramatic focus too short on suspense lapses in storytelling that don't seem like bold artistic choices the movie's a sprawling mess zodiac was an interminable bore there's something strangely flat and enervating about the picture exhaustion kicks in to the point where we're not sure what we're looking at an exercise in frustration I've never seen a movie so full of dead ends one of the dullest of these films to date. Zodiac runs an astonishing two hours and 40 minutes, and it feels like it."" Each one of those quotes is from a different review.These reviews sum up for me the movie that I experienced.

However this movie is not with out its flaws it can be difficult to understand at times which may distract the viewer, and I feel that Anthony Edwards was not right for his role however small it may be (and I'm a huge Anthony Edwards fan by the way), but these are small flaws that are mostly opinionated.

'Zodiac' is an Engrossing Murder Mystery,"The latest film by director David Fincher (Se7en, Fight Club) is not your standard crime drama or psychological thriller. Whereas most films dealing with crime try to pump up the action and suspense, 'Zodiac' is more concerned with intrigue, procedure, and investigation. This is a gritty, detail-oriented, documentary-like film that aims for realism and authenticity. Although 'Zodiac' is about a notorious serial killer, it's investigative journalism that is the film's primary focus. Because the culprit was never caught the story is told from the perspective of those who became caught up in the case. 'Zodiac' is ultimately a tale about an obsession: the killer's obsession with violence, the public's fascination with crime, and the journalist's obsession to crack the case.'Zodiac' is a true story recounting the details of one of the most notorious murder mysteries in American history. The Zodiac was a serial killer who made a series of seemingly random murders in the San Francisco Bay area in the late 60's and early 70's. What set the case apart was the fact that the killer took credit for his crimes and even went so far as to contact local newspapers to brag about what he had done. The Zodiac would provide clues to his identity in elaborate symbols and codes sketched out on paper. He would make threats to the press that if they didn't publish his confessions he would commit even more gruesome crimes. The press faced a dilemma: disobey the Zodiac and risk more lives or submit to his demands and give legitimacy to a murderer.We never get a good look at the Zodiac because, after all, he was never actually caught. The primary suspect, Arthur Allen, eventually died of a heart attack before he could be brought into custody. It's unclear if he could have been charged for any crime since his fingerprints never matched the ones at the scene of the crimes.The elusiveness of the case caused more than a few headaches for those involved in solving it. A reporter for the San Francisco Enquirer, Paul Avery (Robert Downey Jr.), thinks he knows the psychology of the Zodiac better than anyone. Avery is not so sure the killer is always telling the truth and is more convinced that the Zodiac is just some perverted narcissist trying to get attention. Others on the case, such as Inspector David Toschi (Mark Ruffalo), come up against so many hurdles in the investigation that they're forced to give up. Robert Graysmith (Jake Gyllenhaal), a cartoonist for the San Francisco Enquirer, is an exception. Rather than give up on a case that seems to have no end in sight, he becomes obsessed with solving it even at the cost of sacrificing any semblance of a personal life. By the end of the tale, Graysmith is convinced he knows who the killer is. But after ten years of investigation, will anyone believe him?At nearly three hours in length, 'Zodiac' is a long film and certainly feels like it. Although Fincher and the screenwriter, James Vanderbilt, keep the story moving along at a brisk pace, the film ultimately gets bogged down in an endless parade of names, dates, plot points, and other details. You almost have to bring a notepad to keep track of all the events in the story. This is not a fault of the filmmakers but rather an inevitable problem in any movie based on a true story. There's not a lot of thematic depth here because the story itself is murky and inconclusive. Vanderbilt's screenplay is very strong and does a good job of creating genuine interest in the characters. A minor flaw lies in the inclusion of the story of Graysmith's wife, played by Chloe Sevigny. Sevigny, unfortunately, is given very little to do other than stand around and look worried. In a story like this there's not a lot of room for diversion.Despite these complaints 'Zodiac' is a good film and certainly well worth checking out. Even though it's incredibly long I was, nevertheless, always interested and intrigued by the story. All the performances are good, particularly Jake Gyllenhaal who's emerging as one of the finest actors working today. David Fincher's directing is appropriately moody and atmospheric and the production values are great: the CGI shots of San Francisco as it appeared in the 70's are very convincing. For those interested in unsolved murder mysteries, 'Zodiac' should certainly prove to be one of the better films of its kind in recent memory.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Rather late review of the film 'Zodiac' (2007),"Fans of David Finchers work will not be displeased by this somewhat hidden little gem. It is a flawlessly casted and masterfully crafted film with tension and twists around every corner. You will find yourself on the edge of your seat for almost the entirety of this gritty and dark mystery drama that follows the zodiac killer murders and the investigations that followed throughout the late 60's and 70's. The movie primarily focuses on three separate main characters, played by Robert Downey Jr, Jake Gyllenhal and Mark Ruffalo who are all in a constant battle against the notorious 'Zodiac killer' who is outplaying them at every turn. I won't give anymore away in terms of plot.I must praise the director for his ability to make my pulse race and I can honestly say this did occur at least 3 times during this movie and I'm pretty sure if you watch it you will understand what I am talking about. I would not recommend this film to anyone under the age of 18 however because of the violence (although a rare commodity in this flick, when it does happen it is brutal.)Finally I must say that what really stood out to me about this film was that David Fincher substitutes his rather trademarked style of gory and in your face violence (as seen in se7en) for a more dialogue driven and stylised murder mystery film.I sincerely hope anyone who reads this takes my advice and goes to see this film and I hope you enjoy it as much as I did.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Started well.. Deteriorated thereafter,"I've got to say, when I came to look at the reviews after having watched 'Zodiac' tonight, I was very surprised to see so many positive reviews. Having watched it with a few friends tonight, I was very disappointed. The film started off very promising, with some rather brutal scenes filmed intimately for maximum impact - had me squirming in my seat and I was set for an hour or so's worth of engaging cinema. But the film deteriorated steadily from that point onwards, having me fidgeting in my seat until I was too lethargic to move. The pace appeared to disappear from about 1 hour in and never returned from that point onwards. I appreciate this is a movie recording over 20 years worth of actual events, but at some point the director must use some 'artistic license' to introduce some entertainment...Robert Downey Jnr. was fantastic portraying a drunkard spiralling towards his own self-destruction...perfect casting from that point of view...All in all, a little to serious and slow-moving for my liking... but hey, each to their own",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Intelligent and well-made...,"Films based on fact are naturally given a certain licence to include detail that would be cut from a fictional movie due to pacing and running time issues, so it's no wonder that Zodiac's running time is so long. Despite this, I never found the film anything less than fascinating (the only thing I knew about Zodiac was that Scorpio, Andy Robinson's character in Dirty Harry  which is referenced in this film  was based on him) and was surprised at how quickly the two-and-a-half-hours passed. Longer running times are OK as far as I'm concerned anyway  it means the producers are governed by things other than the number of daily screenings that can be squeezed in at the MultiplexFincher's take on the killings and their inevitable repercussions is fairly solid. He clearly hasn't set out to provide the audience with thrills, but to examine the killings' impact on the characters involved in finding the killer  either officially or otherwise. Mark Ruffalo is believable as the dogged Inspector Toschi whose professionalism prevents him from allowing the case from taking over his life in the way it does Graysmith (Jake Gyllenhaal), but which also prevents him from completely letting go. Gyllenhaal isn't my favourite actor by a long mark, but this is the type of role he is made for  slightly geeky and hesitant, more at home in a library than at a crime scene. To him the crime is a puzzle that has to be solved. Robert Downey plays dissolute journalist Paul Avery, a role for which he presumably had to do little research. In many ways, the effect of the case on Avery's life is more devastating than it is on Graysmith, and Downey is perfect for the part.Perhaps, the main flaw is that Fincher can't seem to decide whether to focus on the long hunt for the killer by Graysmith or the effect it has on his home life. While most of the screen time is devoted to Graysmith's dogged pursuit of Zodiac, the time devoted to his domestic life seems almost superfluous, as if it belonged to another, related, movie. Graysmith becomes a married father after just one scene of meeting his future wife, and the handling of Zodiac's telephone harassment of the family is handled almost perfunctorily, as is the eventual breakdown of the marriage. It almost seems as if Fincher feels obliged to include these details but isn't really very interested in them. And while the film is supposed to perhaps leave questions unanswered (even though it leaves no doubt in the viewer's mind as to who it believes the culprit to be), some of the questions that remain you feel should have been addressed.In a genre that leans toward the stalk-and-slash mentality, Zodiac stands out as an absorbing, intelligent and tightly constructed entry that is more than worth a look.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

Personally...,"I feel like my whole life had passed in front of my eyes in two hours and a half. Many movies cover many years of the lives of their characters (""The Shawshank redemption"" is a perfect example that comes to mind), but few do it so vividly as David Fincher's ""Zodiac""; the story of a serial killer who haunted the police and the press for thirty years. If you need to know, the case hasn't been solved yet.What happens in ""Zodiac"" is that: a lot of years. Some of the characters really seem like they've aged with the dates we see on screen and some look the same, but we stop caring at one point because we're completely involved in the story. I wouldn't say that the movie moves fast, but it definitely moves strong; it is, as ""Letters From Iwo Jima"", a piece of instant impact and a director's piece in every aspect.If you've seen a David Fincher film before, you can expect to be confused; so don't complain if ""Zodiac"" is a bit messy and hard to follow; but it's not ""The Game"" or ""Fight Club"". Those two films also shocked me just after watching them, but I don't totally recall them today. Maybe ""Zodiac"" is Fincher's movie that will stick with me the most; maybe it is his masterpiece, and if you haven't seen any of his films, it's a good place to start.It would be fair to say that it is the development of the case what is hard to keep up with, but fortunately that's just one thing of the diversity ""Zodiac"" has to offer. In fact, it's one of the beauties of the film that the 'investigation' is not everything. Fincher knows we've seen to many mystery movies where the case is the focus and where the viewer has to work hard to figure it out (""The Usual Suspects"" is a perfect example that comes to mind), so he speeds up the process giving a lot of changing but easy to understand resolutions.I know it's contradictoryIt's a disorganized process with simple answers, but it's the director's choice; and we forgive him because he provides so much more. ""Zodiac"" is not just the story of a murder being solved; it's a character piece of the most unusual nature. It's not just about cops and reporters doing their jobs; it's about working men bored with the routine, longing for excitement and about working men frustrated because they can't succeed at the only thing they do.The first of these explanations refers to two of the main characters: Paul Avery (a flawless Robert Downey Jr.); a reporter with a lot of guts and a fondness for alcohol, and Robert Graysmith (a not so convincing Jake Gyllenhaal, at least after having seen him in ""Jarhead""-if you like the guy you must see that film-); a cartoonist who wrote the best-selling book in which the film is based. The latter explanation applies to Bill Armstrong (Anthony Edwards) and Dave Toschi (the great Mark Ruffalo: phenomenal); two cops devoted to the case and unable to crack it.Talking Awards (I know Matias likes that), this is not the film of the year; but it's the kind of film that due to its nature, could get a Best Ensemble nomination for the SAG Award: besides the leads it has Chloe Sevigny, Brian Cox, Phillip Baker Hall, Dermot Mulroney, Donal Logue, Clea DuVall, Adam Goldberg...Not bad. And maybe Adapted Screenplay somewhere; don't know.Personally, I believe this is one of those pieces where the director is crucial; and I would be glad to see an Oscar nomination 'a la' David Lynch with ""Mulholland Dr.""; because I think David Fincher should have had one by now But that's just my opinion.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
"Good as a reconstruction, but not so as a thriller :/","Honestly - I was expecting more. But honestly - I don't know why... :)This film is good, but I have to say that ... I was bored in the middle of the screening. It reminds me Michael Mann's ""The Insider"" with Russel Crowe - very good ""reportage"" thing, but it lacks the suspense in the thriller style. It's nobody's fault, because - in both cases - the screenplay was written by life itself :). And life was writing it quite long time. So, there are mostly only FACTS in the story. With little amount of fiction. And those facts simply lies in history in not very special order - the story of Zodiac simply doesn't have the thriller-like dramaturgy line with rising amount of suspense and terrifying final scene. That is why the film does not thrill as much as ""Seven"", or Silence of the Lambs"". It rather intrigues. Like ""The Insider"". That's why I was little disappointed. One or two scenes were quite thrilling but that's it.Another bothering thing, when dealing with FACTS, is that You know from the beginning how the film is gonna end :(.PROS:* Great acting - Mark Ruffalo especially, but Robert Downey Jr. is good too (as always)* interesting as a ""reconstruction""* interesting character transformation of Graysmith (well played by Jake Gyllenhaal - again good acting)CONS:* Rather boring in the middle* lots of unnecessary details (dates and places especially) - I still remember the name Sherwood, but I don't know who it was in the film :)* not a thriller :)",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
The Tora! Tora! Tora! of true crime films.,"The Zodiac killer operated in San Fransisco and Vallejo, California in the late 60s and early 70s. This movie is a portrayal of the press and police investigation with out three main characters being Robert Graysmith (Jake Gyllenhaal) a political cartoonist who becomes a press detective to track down the Zodiac, Paul Avery (Robert Downey Jr.) a sarcastic crime journalist, and Inspector Dave Toschi (Mark Ruffalo) a seasoned SFPD homicide detective. These are all real people and although I don't know if they were as connected to each other in real life as they are in this movie it makes the film more enjoyable. Gyllenhaal and Ruffalo are great, but Downey I think steals the show. His Bill Murray style portrayal of Avery is just brilliant. Other actors I can commend are Brian Cox who plays lawyer Melvin Belli and John Carroll Lynch who plays suspect Arthur Leigh Allen. I've always been interested in the Zodiac case and if you're interested too then check this movie out. You don't even have to be interested in the case either.

It is much like an American take on a English crime drama! And if you just look a bit further than you will see that it is about obsession! It is not about finding out who the Zodiac killer is but it is about the people who are involved that try to do so! That doesn't mean that this movie is not thrilling! It is to a certain degree! You get sucked in by the main characters. We want them to be successful! But in the end it just points out what can happen to (for the most part) ordinary people who get obsessed for some reason! Overall ""Zodiac"" is quite intriguing and interesting! But it won't be for everyone! When a movie is about serial killers most of the viewers want to see brutal killings and a solution to the crimes presented! There is none of that in this movie! It is more or less a realistic approach based on real facts! Give it a try!",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
One of 2007's Finest; One of the Best of its Kind.,"For a number of years the Zodiac Killer terrorized citizens of the San Francisco area as well as the journalists and police force who worked feverishly to stop him to no avail. ""Zodiac"" is as much about the murders as it is about the aftermath of the events and the toll it took on a handful of people who perhaps sacrificed more than their job called for in an effort to reveal the killer's identity.David Fincher brings the true life horror story to life with what is perhaps his most methodical and restrained effort to date. With as much attention to detail as possible (down to matching the wardrobes of the cast to that of the real-life victims) Fincher reels back his usual sense of style in favor for a more matter-of-fact, realistic tone, letting the story and the actors speak for themselves. There are moments such as the taxi-cab scene where his style is in full-effect, but unlike his previous film, ""Panic Room,"" the film doesn't hinge solely on good looks. At times, such as the murder by the lake, it's easy to forget that you're watching a movie.The film is host to a wealth of knock-out performances, the least of all being Robert Downey Jr. in a comeback role that surely should have earned him at least an Oscar nod. Surely, his turn in this movie was more effective than that in ""Tropic Thunder,"" but I digress. Downey is almost too natural and too perfect as the flamboyant and sensational journalist Paul Avery. Jake Gyllenhaal is given perhaps one of his juiciest roles to date as the cartoonist turned novelist Robert Graysmith who puts everything -- including his wife and kids -- on hold for the sake of his obsession. Also of note are Mark Ruffalo and Anthony Edwards as a pair of detectives hot on the Zodiac's trail.All in all, ""Zodiac"" is an in-depth account of real-life events and is certainly a lot to take in. The passage of time thankfully goes by fast, as you'll more than likely find yourself wrapped up in the story much like the people you're watching become. For Fincher, it marks a new standard and shows the director as more than just an MTV-bred cult film-maker. This is without a doubt one of the finest films from 2007 and one of the best of its kind. Not to be missed.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Good,Not your average hunt hot on the heels of a fast ride serial killer. Instead this shows some kills at the beggining the one on the lake stands out as the masked killer sounds unskilled & unsure whilst the male victim is being reassuring to his lady mistakenly which makes this more creepy. Its a long movie as the case basically went on for decades and was unsolved though to me as soon as we see the watch guy I thought it was him but their trail goes cold on any suspects and in the end only jake gyllenhal who really owns this film as he usually does is the one who doesn't give up for years. But we are left with the real ending that can be frustrating to some but is true to its core for others. Was nice to See chloe Seigvny I never realized she was in it.

Gripping tense thriller,"One of the most intriguing unsolved serial killer cases of modern times. This movie is full of heavyweight actors who play their parts to the very best of their ability.Even though the movie is quite long, it never lets up. You feel the frustration of everyone involved in trying to solve these crimes. The era of the late 60's and early 70's is very well recreated. The fact that it's based on a true story makes it even more appealing.Years down the line, the police investigation ran out of steam and there wasn't the money or manpower to keep the investigation hot. But Jake G's character from a newspaper kept it going.This movie is the benchmark by which all factual crime dramas should be made. Tense and thrilling - the pace never lets up.

Rambling Thriller,"Based on true events in late 1960s and early 1970s, a cartoonist for a San Francisco newspaper becomes obsessed with finding the Zodiac killer. The film moves in fits and starts as the detectives investigating the crime pursue one fruitless lead after another. Although fascinating initially, this approach becomes somewhat tiresome after a while, especially considering the running time of nearly three hours.

A Modern Classic,"In the same way that virtually everyone knows the verdict in Oliver Stone's brilliant movie JFK, I should think everyone who is interested in the Zodiac case, should know, just like JFK, it was never solved. The Zodiac by David Fincher, is a film about the investigation that took place into this elusive serial killer, who in my mind may not have been a serial killer at all, but a group of killers. That is the fascination of the Zodiac case, the fact that it was never solved. This fascination is shared by many many people even today.David Fincher's Zodiac is in the tradition of the classic intelligent conspiracy thrillers, such as JFK, ALL THE PRESIDENTS MEN and the EIGER SANCTION. It is most certainly a character driven movie, focusing on the driven characters who try to hunt down and figure out from the plethora of cryptic messages and scant testimony of witnesses , who the zodiac is. It is a movie about the fascination the Zodiac case had on someone and how they get so obsessed with the mysterious killer, that they give up everything in order to find out who he is. It is very well made and very entertaining and like the case, fascinating.It is filmed in the periods of 1969 to 1991 , and looks authentic, the period details very convincing, they transport you to the times. This is another thing in favour of this film, the way it looks, and also how it was acted by the two leads, who play the newspaper men who got caught up in the fascination trap of trying to crack the Zodiac puzzle. All through the movie we trace them in the centre of it , and are shown how the obsession affects their lives forever.The important characters in this film, to me, are the newspaper men, rather than the police involved, as to them it is just routine and part of their Job. But with the newspaper men, you can tell they really want to know who the Zodiac is, because the Zodiac is more than a killer, he is a enigmatic mind, and becomes to them a never ending game , forcing their own brains to rise to the challenge of his Zodiac puzzle.Like i said it is a classic , a modern classic. There are not many films made of this standard today,,,,,,,,,,, 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Jake Gyllenhaal and Mark Ruffalo delivered superb performances for this 1960s true life period thriller,"This was a well directed docudrama by David Fincher. The superb performances by Jake Gyllenhaal who plays the San Francisco Chronicles cartoonist turned investigative journalist and writer Robert Graysmith, as well as Mark Ruffalo's performance as the lead homicide detective, Inspector Davis Toschi, kept this film interesting throughout just as the real life mystery of the 1963-1970 Zodiac's suspected victims that remain unsolved to this day.The film has a terrific supporting cast which blends in nicely with the 1960's story, costumes and dressings. I love the mystery/thrillers that took place during the 1960's and 1970's as I was a teenager during that time and I have vivid memories of the world wide phenom of the Zodiac killers mystery.This is a must watch for all filmgoers who love the thriller/mystery genres. I give it a well deserved 7 out of 10 IMDB rating.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
In the sign of the Seventies,"If you're expecting another SE7EN from David Fincher you'll be disappointed. ZODIAC is not a conventional thriller, in fact, it never shocks at all. Knowing that the real Zodiac-crimes where never solved and knowing that Fincher would never fictionalize a true story makes it difficult to move towards a climax.It's actual strength lies in the almost perfect citation of early 70's movie making. This works on three levels: The ""outer"", meaning the look of the film. The colors are reduced but heavy, the camera-movements are as slow as is the editing.The ""inner""-level - the designs, the cars, the hair-dues, the phones, the clothes - makes you feel, you're watching an episode of ""Kojak"".And finally, the ""perceptional"" level: As a moviegoer of the 21st century you are constantly faced with what it must have felt like to see a film in, let's say 1971. When someone gets killed, it's in a long, torturing shot - no ""bullet-time"" here folks! It's a blessing for a change.Of course, when you think of San Francisco and Crime you think of DIRTY HARRY. And he actually appears in ZODIAC. As the film ZODIAC can't be. Because it's heroes - unlike Harry Callahan - go by the book. Interestingly enough that the character ""Scorpio"" in DIRTY HARRY was influenced by the Zodiac-killings.The other movie that seems to be heavily influential on ZODIAC is ALL THE PRESIDENT'S MEN. Because most of the crime solving here also takes place in an editorial office. At a time when there was no internet, no cell phones and even faxes where rare it becomes obvious that the main problem to find the killer is not the evidence but the communication amongst the observers.That's the center of Fincher's film: To show that in real live police-work is as vulnerable to human mistakes as is an argument amongst married people. And that serial killers are no psycho-geniuses, just every day lunatics.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Zodiac Film Review,"David Fincher's Zodiac is a frustratingly drawn-out affair that fails to deliver the suspense and intrigue one might expect from a crime thriller.From the outset, the film's pacing is sluggish, with seemingly endless sequences of police interviews, suspect line-ups, and the reading of cryptic letters. The first half-hour is particularly guilty of this, setting a tone of tedium that persists throughout. While there are moments of genuine tension, such as the murder scenes, they are few and far between, and the film's overall narrative structure leaves much to be desired.The film's obsession with detail, particularly in its meticulous recounting of the investigation, is both a strength and a weakness. On the one hand, it provides a fascinating glimpse into the complexities of real-life crime-solving. On the other, it can feel overly exhaustive, making it difficult to maintain interest. The constant jumping between dates and the introduction of numerous suspects can be disorienting, and the lack of a clear, compelling narrative arc leaves the viewer feeling adrift.The character of Robert Graysmith, the amateur sleuth who becomes obsessed with the Zodiac case, is a particularly problematic element of the film. While his dedication is admirable, his obsession borders on the pathological, and his relentless pursuit of the killer can be off-putting. His personal life suffers as a result, and yet he remains undeterred. It's a performance that is both compelling and exasperating, and it ultimately serves to undermine the film's overall effectiveness.Zodiac is a film that clearly aims to be a gritty, realistic portrayal of a real-life crime. However, in its pursuit of authenticity, it sacrifices much of the dramatic tension and narrative drive that are essential to a successful thriller. While it may be a worthwhile watch for those with a particular interest in true crime, it is unlikely to satisfy those seeking a gripping and entertaining cinematic experience.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Very good,"Obsessively rating every movie I've watched since 2010 enables me to say that I first saw Zodiac almost exactly 10 years ago, on 8 August 2013. It's not one of my absolute favorites, but it feels worthy of revisiting once a decade; there's a ton to like here, and I was happy to see it continues to hold up well.Speaking of doing things obsessively, I feel like Zodiac does a great job at capturing paranoia and obsession, and the slow, insidious way a dedication that's too fierce can harm a person's life. I don't remember if I felt this way a decade ago, but watching it now, I think the best parts of this are the scenes that focus on Jake Gyllenhaal's character, with his obsession being central within the final act. Gyllenhaal does this kind of character so well here, even if I think they could have gone a bit further with making him look disheveled towards the end (at one point, he's embarrassed to be seen by another character, implying he's been holed up doing nothing but going over documents, presumably without sleep or showering, but his hair's still quite well-styled).Mark Ruffalo and Robert Downey Jr. Are also quite good, but I think Downey Jr. Was a touch too mumbly, with his (now kind of trademark) rapid-fire dialogue being sometimes hard to make out. His snarky character does benefit the movie, though - Zodiac's in no way a comedy, but there's still a surprising amount of humor throughout, and the way everyone talks fast also sometimes gives it the feel of the comedy (though they're usually talking fast about serious things, like murder).It's paced well and goes by pretty quickly, considering it's about 2.5 hours long. Knowing the outcome of the case also does little to reduce the suspense and intrigue of it all, though to its benefit, the film ends up becoming more interested in the characters dealing with the case, rather than conveniently ""solving"" it in any way. It's not quite as good as Fincher's previous Se7en, and I might even prefer his Gone Girl adaptation, but Zodiac still scratches the same itch, and scratches it well.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Long with no end,"The movie was not bad but wasnt intresting enough for me. Its just didnt led anywhere and it didnt really had an ending, and also nor the zodiac case, which is why I dont get why basing a movie around it.

But its hard to rate a film you dont understand or like, so a strong 65 will work for me.

Disappointing,"As a huge fan of Se7en I couldn't wait to see David Fincher's latest film, Zodiac. After over two and a half hours of the movie I walked out of the theater stunned stunned at how hugely disappointing it was.I never thought I'd say this about a Fincher movie but Zodiac is just plain boring. The movie is way, way too long. You just don't care about the characters or about what's going on after a while. Forget about any kind of cool cinematography like you've seen in Se7en, Fightclub or even Panic Room. Zodiac looks like the exact opposite of anything that the director has done before. It seems to be purposely bland.Zodiac seems to purposely want to grind away at you with detail after detail, underplaying events with ultra low key acting & photography. The experience for me was that I had been ground down to not caring anymore about wanting to stay in the theater. I couldn't wait for the movie to end or for it to peter out with a whimper as it eventually does.",2.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Zodiac,"I knew this movie was directed by David Fincher (Fight Club, Panic Room, Seven, Game, Alien), and that makes it irresistible for movie lovers like me. But I always read HATE reviews on IMDb before I go to see the movie, so that I would be more critical in my outlook and look at the movie in a more balanced way. This time too I read the utterly bad reviews of Zodiac, and with cross fingers entered the hall.The story is simple, based on true events, spans from 1963 - 1970 multiple murders by a person named Zodiac in Northern California. The case remains open, unsolved till date; with the closest suspect Arthur Leigh Allen dead in 1992, it only remains (and will always remain) a speculation of sorts  who the real Zodiac Killer was.Zodiac is one of the very popular American subject since 1960s - 9 movies, 5 TV serials, 4 graphic novels, 6 novels and numerous magazine articles  showcases this. Everyone knows the story. It has been told in so many types, ways and fashion  that the only interesting point as a spectator is to see how David Fincher tells the story differently. As all of you can imagine, the task was uphill from the very beginning, include the personal baggage of his good movies that he needs to prove his worth. I say, too much of a burden on David's shoulder.David Fincher could have taken a narrative style very functional to the commercial format, which has already been used time and again  serial killers  till we are bored to death seeing those movies. But David Fincher uses a totally classical style of directing this thriller. He takes his time (148 minutes in total), he keeps the storyline simple and straight forward (no flashbacks), he uses the novelistic style of narrative  that slowly unfolds and engages you; he uses not a big star-cast to blow the script and screenplay off its ground.I not only enjoyed the movie but loved it too. Fantastic is my verdict. One more feather on David's cap. There are several characters and actors (Jake Gyllenhaal, Mark Ruffalo, Anthony Edwards, Robert Downey, John Carroll etc.), but I won't spend time writing about any of them, because the movie solely belongs to David  the director's medium! Those who have written poor and hated reviews were expecting a Dirty Harry (one of the foremost Zodiac adaptation) style; or a Fight Club  and surely they are disappointed. I only say that their minds are one dimensional and David Fincher has risen above fan club's earthly expectations to do something daringly different and he succeeds in it.Hats off to David Fincher! Looking forward to seeing his next venture - The Curious case of Benjamin Button; where he comes with a huge star cast  Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett.(Stars 8 out of 10)",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
"Wow, what a GREAT movie!","Phew, wow. Just finished watching Zodiac, and I have to say that it FAR exceeded my expectations!Frankly, I wasn't sure what to expect. ""Zodiac"" popped up on my Netflix ""recommended"" list for unknown reasons. I had heard good buzz about the film, although I don't remember it being out. So I said ""meh"" and rented it.This film has reminded me of what good, suspense drama is all about. It has literally renewed my faith in the genre.I don't want to over-analyze the film, because I think that might ruin it, but here's a quick list of what I found appealing about the film:-- Its pacing and tension is reminiscent of some of the dramatic elements of great 60's/70's crime dramas like Serpico and Bullitt.-- Yet it tells the story without any great car chases or shoot outs. This is a VERY good thing, for you find yourself absorbed into the story without being shocked out of it by noise.-- It is even filmed using 70's era lighting techniques. It looks like you're watching a classic, but it was filmed in 2007! This SO suits this film.-- The characters are gritty and real. No pretty boys or hot vixens. This helps absorb you into the story.-- The acting is top notch. These folks do what good acting is supposed to do: makes you forget these are actors, even though some of them have big names (one exception: Brian Cox does come on a bit strong as attorney Melvin Belli, but actually, he ROCKS this performance, because it's supposed to be over-the-top). The cast is quite stellar in this.-- It keeps you guessing all the way through, but it also doesn't lose you in vagaries. The writers aren't TRYING to lose you, they're just telling a complex story and asking you to keep up. Kudos to them.-- It does not overburden you with heavy detail like some murder mysteries. Instead it portrays the illusion that the CHARACTERS are overburdened with detail. This is a huge plot point and very well played. There are no deus ex machinas here, you can tell the characters earned every bit of their successes (and failures).-- There is enough creep, gore, and suspense to keep you adequately ""wierded out"".I tell ya: I really liked this flick. Makes me have hope for movies again.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
An open letter to IMDb readers from Zodiac,"There I was, the most incisive, quotable, culturally literate review I'd ever written  just sitting there on my desktop, awaiting internet publication  a review so good it was almost a religious experience and what happens? I get a letter from my old friend the Zodiac killer whom having seen the David Fincher film based on his case, felt compelled (as he inevitably does) to write what he thought of it and would I mind posting the text of his letter instead? Normally I'd have told him to go and shoot some teenagers but he let me advertise for a room mate on his myspace once soAn open letter to IMDb readers from ZodiacHello David, this is the Zodiac.Did you see it? I suppose you must have by now. You better have made an attempt for your sake and not, as you threatened to do, go and see that Pirates of the Caribbean crap. Looks like I won our little wager but it's like I told you  if you want a movie made about you you'll either have do something important or do what I did and murder some young people (and one idiot cab driver, though to be fair they're sort of okay as they're always overcharging people anyway  I mean, $6 for a $3 fare? You know he deserved it).So last night, after what seemed like an eternity, I finally got time off to go to the Castro Theater and see Zodiac, the long overdue film about me. I mean what took them so long for Christ's sake? I don't want to hear about Dirty Harry, I mean, sure, good movie and I loved the girl in a hole stuff  wish I'd thought of it, but Andy Robinson was such a flake. Getting caught so easily and laughing like a pervert. That's supposed to be me? If murder wasn't a capital crime I'd have sued their asses clean off.So anyway, the Fincher movie isn't too bad. #$%****()  there you go, pick the bones out of that. Did I confound your analogue mind? I've got a books worth of these. So yeah, It was pretty good, took me right back to the glory days  lots of great period detail and that pig Toschi was just like I imagined him  absolutely clueless. Well I say clueless, he did interview me but you don't get arrested for sweating like a rapist and licking your lips every time a murder is mentioned. Incidentally that was a shock to me too.&&**((%^#. Any ideas? You don't have a clue do you? Its important to have a USP if you're planning on being a serial murderer, people forget that and that's why in the league of psychotic media folk legends I'm still in top five, though Jack the Ripper is always going to be no.1 and overrated for the same reason as the Beatles will always supersede the Stones  history never forgives you if you go on too long.Gore Verbinski take note.Even though I wasn't in Zodiac as much as I would of liked I still enjoyed the stuff about bird brain Avery and that geek Graysmith, to whom I'd have paid a visit if he didn't live on the other side of town and it wasn't two buses. It's certainly ironic that I killed several people and slept pretty well at night, sometimes better because of what I did and these guys fell apart and got all obsessive. And they didn't even shoot anyone! Merely slaves in my world. Watching Avery, as played by Downley Jnr, stuffing popcorn into my mouth was all I could not to laugh. I suppose you noticed (and would have droned on about) the recurring time motif in the movie? I named myself after a watch, time is always referenced, the search for me goes on across decades, etc Loved that 'time lapse' scene with the Transamerica pyramid  isn't it incredible what they can do these days? Yeah, my work certainly did burn up those pigs lives.Also, did you notice how Fincher took a celluloid swing at me by flouting thriller conventions? I'll bet you did you geeky freak. I love the movies, this is well known and the one I dreamt about, involving myself, had more gore and just focused on how good I was, particularly toward the end when the pigs gave up and I laughed at their embarrassment. You saw Seven, right? That was my movie in all but name. So having waited all these years I finally get the film of my life and it isn't about me at all, plus it doesn't even stick to the formula of these things. Why wasn't Graysmith psychologically connected to me in some way and where was the climax? John Doe got a head in a box and I get a photo I.D in an airport? Man, I couldn't have killed enough people.&*#$$%!^. See what I did there? Of course you didn't you servile camel jacker.By the way, are we still on for Wedding Daze?",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
It's more like a documentary than really a movie!,"This film by David Fincher based on the real story of an American serial killer that called himself Zodiac, is more like a documentary than really a movie! OK that Fincher's work probably has some fiction, that's not the point, what I really mean is that this ""movie"" is almost all done in a reported way. The plot is about the all investigation since it's beginning in the later 60's to our days; so there are too many time holes. If there's fiction (I don't know the real facts and I didn't even read the book, so I can't be sure), and I suppose there is, it's probably just some insignificant details, because the main elements ""seem"" to be true I don't know, I just didn't appreciate too much this ""documentary style"" in this movie.

Plodding and ponderous with abrupt ending,"The late, great (usually) film critic Roger Ebert got it badly wrong when he said this tale of newspaper man turned detective was without all the cliches usual to the form. In fact the writing is so clearly on the wall from the first few scenes that we don't even need to wait for Jake Gyllenhaal to start his code breaking and sleuthing to know that he'll eventually get his man where three Police forces and half a dozen top journalists fail.Movies like this, based on a true story, need more than a linear adherence to the facts (such as they are) to make them involving and rewarding, on which two counts Zodiac barely limps across the finishing line.In fact the ending is so abrupt and unsatisfactory that you'll think someone switched off your internet connection by accident, possibly when they were reaching for the fast forward button on your remote.Obsessive junior newspaper man comes good and saves the day (but loses his beautiful family in the process)?

An Engaging Mystery Thriller Filled with Unexpected Twists and Genuine Tension,"Zodiac follows a magazine company as a killer calling himself Zodiac contacts them. The police use the letters received to hunt down the killer, meanwhile the criminal writer in the company conducts his own search, and the cartoonist develops a sort of obsession with finding Zodiac.The performances are pretty much what I've come to expect from these actors. Jake Gyllenhaal, one of my favorite actors, pulls off a pretty great performance, and Robert Downey Jr. is pretty great too. The biggest surprise for me was from Mark Ruffalo. I haven't been horribly impressed by him in the past, not to say he's a bad actor by any means, but he's just not amazing. Until Zodiac, that is. He's pretty fantastic, and definitely someone I'll be looking forward to seeing in the future. The rest of the performances are noticeably better than one might expect.The whole story is just very interesting. It's presented in such a way so that every one of the three leads receives a pretty equal amount of screen time, and the story dedicates itself to wherever the most important stuff is happening. There will be plenty of times where certain characters aren't seen for long stretches of time, which isn't a bad thing, but rather keeps the movie going at a good pace, which is especially important for a movie with a run time like this one. It hits 2 hours and 37 minutes, and thankfully it wasn't at all boring.Not only is the pacing great, but the story is filled with twists and turns, bursts of tension and intrigue. It's just such a fascinating story, filled with all sorts of possible endings. Part of why the pacing is so good is because of these scenes. Tension rises, and you as the audience begins to believe that the movie may be wrapping up, but then it surprises you yet again and continues. There were multiple points where I thought the movie was getting close to ending, and that was never the case. I never checked how much time I had left, partly to better immerse myself into the movie and not worry about the time, but also because I just didn't want the movie to end. It never fakes the audience out of the ending, but it seems like it could be getting close a couple times, so the audience is prepared for it to continue, but not just end in a few minutes.The characters themselves are also just really interesting to watch. They play off of each other very well and are fleshed out when they need to be. Moreover, their relationships are well-developed over the course of the entire Zodiac case.The choice to only show scenes relating to the case itself is both a good thing and somewhat a bad thing, in that there is little to nothing shown about the characters interacting with anyone or doing anything that doesn't involve the Zodiac. The characters are still well-developed during the time it takes to find Zodiac, and I appreciate that it was able to pull this off without ever straying from the case. I think that if the movie tried to switch to the characters and their own family conflicts and all that it would have been out-of-place, but it also could have added something to the characters. Not including that aspect didn't take away from the movie, however, so it's hardly something to complain about. I'm glad that the movie chose not to add any non-Zodiac material because it makes the movie focused and stand out more, but if done right it could have added to the movie, maybe. It's more something I just thought I should address and less of an issue in the actual movie.Overall Zodiac is fantastic. It's got great performances all around, the pacing is fantastic, the characters are well-developed and interesting, the whole story is fascinating and tense, and the choices in presentation are smart. In the end I would definitely recommend this movie.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
There's a killer on the road !!!!,"Zodiac is based on the novel written by Robert Graysmith about the notorious ""Zodiac"" killer who went on a killing spree in and around the San Francisco Bay Area during the late 1960s and the early 1970s. Unlike Seven or Fight Club, Fincher adopted a very non-showy approach to tell the story in the overall sense, but his characteristic style is still visible in the look of many scenes throughout the movie.The script and the screenplay is like a labyrinth or a maze of evidence, documents, leads, red herrings and dead ends. Fincher aggressively puts us in the middle of the investigation and refuses to provide any relief from this never ending saga of relentless evidence analysis and exploration. Due to this, when the film ends you feel like you have been a part of the proceedings too. The film doesn't have any chases or too much gory violence. The murder scenes take place very early within the first 30 minutes,throughout the remaining portion, emphasis is placed on the nitty-gritty aspects of the evidence exploration.We follow Robert Graysmith(Gyllenhaal), Dave Toschi(Ruffalo) and Paul Avery(Downey Jr.) on the continuous pursuit of the Zodiac killer. Along with the real aspects of the investigation, the theme of the film is to show how the lives of investigators can get hugely affected by the harrowing aspect of being a part of such a long winded case which never seems to reach a satisfactory conclusion. It is more about the journey than the destination. Chasing a serial killer can lead to an obsession which is not much different than the obsession which engulfed that very serial killer in the first place and it can lead to complete deterioration of personal and professional lives.For a movie which is 2 hours 45 minutes long, it feels extremely enjoyable and never boring. Fincher avoids clichés that have perennially plagued the crime mystery genre. He expects the viewer to keep up with the plot. He never compromises by inserting any unnecessary action scenes. The cinematography like all Fincher films is great. The production design expertly recreates a look of the film very appropriate for the era to which the story belongs. The colour yellow plays a huge role in the visual context to convey the themes in the plot. Above all this film masterfully shows how even in a cop investigation thriller like this, closure can be achieved through means other than the hero shooting the villain in the end.Zodiac is a long film and requires some effort from the viewer while watching, but with the required amount of focus, this is a rewarding experience. The film is supremely re-watchable and the plot always feels addictive no matter how many times you have watched it before.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Definitely recommendable for those interested in the genre,"Zodiac is a typical David Fincher movie, a good crime drama based on real events with enough tension to include the film in the thriller category as well. The cast is well chosen and everyone's performance is equally great, leading to an overall good quality in terms of acting. One may argue that the film's a bit longer than it should have been, which I agree, but it still isn't boring, because the questions add up and tension grows, so you don't really notice how much time's passed. At different time points you may end up suspecting different characters to be involved in the Zodiac killings, and this certainly makes it a better movie, and makes you want to watch till the end and find out what actually is happening and who's done what. The ending is my least favorite part, not satisfactory enough, but it seems there's not much to do about it as the ending is also based on real events. Obviously, real life isn't as interesting as movie world. All in all, for those who like these kind of movies, Zodiac is highly recommendable. For instance, those who liked Fincher's Se7en would most probably enjoy this film as well.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Hot and Cold,"There are open-and-shut murder cases and there are unsolved cases. This is one for the books. Until today, the killer who calls himself the Zodiac hasn't been brought to justice although there is strong evidence who the killer is.It's always a pleasant experience watching the likes of Robert Downey Jr., Jake Gylllenhaal and Mark Ruffalo display their thespic talent but the story moves forward because of Jake as Robert Graysmith, one-time cartoonist of the San Francisco Chronicle, who becomes obsessed with unmasking the killer. He carries the baton when all those who matter have withdrawn from the race. People like Paul Avery, Bill Armstrong, Davis Toschi, Jake Mulinax and Ken Narlaw.It might be exhausting for the engrossed viewer to follow the investigation year in, year out without much success.Dir.

"The story is too confusing, movie is not enough to cover everything","The movie tries to include all directions and hypothesis to Zodiac's identity. But it makes the film hard to follow.
Suspects come and go; there is no clear build-up as to why they are suspects, and they remain suspects with no clear conclusion.
Yes, I know the reason for it is the story being based on real events. That means many suspects, and as we know, the killer has not been caught until this date. However, I feel that the movie should've been a mini-series with an episode in each direction to cover this story appropriately.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
One of David Fincher's Worst,"Saw Zodiac this past weekend and was bored out of my mind. The movie is a lethargic mess. Lots of scenes go nowhere and lots of characters go nowhere.Here's how I would rate the movie against other David Fincher titles: Se7en = 10... Fightclub = 9... The Game = 7.... Panic Room = 6.75... Zodiac = 2 ... Alien 3 = 1.5. I can't believe all the people who are rating Zodiac with 9's and 10's. Do they honestly believe Zodiac is as good or better than Se7en or Fightclub?My girlfriend and I didn't like the movie at all. I could understand if people were rating this movie in the Panic Room/ Game range of 6 to 7. I wouldn't agree with them at all but at least I could see it as a difference of opinion. But rating this as one of the greatest movies of all time... come on, we are doing movie goers a disservice by over inflating our ratings. People should be skeptical.The average movie goer will find this movie slow, disjointed and cold.",2.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
It's interesting even after a decade,Many might not like this movie coz of the duration but then a movie like this needs such great explanation so that it helps yourself to get involved in the case! The movie makes you feel like it's boring but thats exactly Fincher wanted to!! He wanted to us feel the situation he tells straight to our face that this how it would feel when you have so many suspects from which you will have to find the murderer! Love the way the movie ends like when we expect a movie to end with a proper conclusion or of such thought this doesn't happen so!

You can't make this stuff up,"This is one of the most exciting and engaging movies based on a true story that I have ever seen. You are sucked in from the very beginning and you CAN NOT tear yourself away until you find out the end. The acting is impeccable and the plot unfolds evenly and without unnecessary baggage. Movies based on true stories tend to fall into one of two traps- either they embellish until the ""truth"" is barely distinguishable or they work so hard to tell the ""true story"" that it becomes dry and boring. Real life has too many boring bits. This movie manages to stay quite true to known facts while taking just enough license to make the characters more sympathetic and to keep the tension of the story. There are a lot of jumps in time in order to skip those boring bits of real life but they are done in a way that is easy to follow.This is a must see for true-crime fans or anyone who admires superb acting and storytelling.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
An Articulate Masterpiece,"""Zodiac"" may just be the most unlikely great film I have ever seen. It follows police and reporters investigate a killer, told exclusively from the outside. There is no conclusion, there is no insight, there is just police work. The film is told as the facts unfold, we learn things happen when the characters do, the people we are watching are not the ones driving the story. They follow leads, they hit dead ends, they give up. We experience the case from beginning to end.The violence in the film is minimal and restricted to the very beginning. There is no shoot out, no contrivances, nothing about this movie is phony. That is what makes it so great to watch. It's such a well calculated machine of a rather un-sensational killer. One character even says that more people die in the commute every three months than Zodiac had ever killed. He wrote a few letters and faded into oblivion. That's just what's so interesting about this film. Even after months and years of nothing, the characters pursue the case.The film is also just a masterwork of the craft. When a promising lead falls short, the film seemingly could end, but Fincher keeps the film running for another hour, always entertaining the whole time. Inventive camera work also works wonders in a few shots including one where Zodiac proves his gun was loaded to a helpless victim. You admire the effort, the research, the time people spent into collecting the case files to give this film a layer that is never seen, but felt through out. In short, this is just a wonderful and respectful handling of material when similar films have been lazy and unremarkable. This film is remarkable.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Masterfully directed but flawed,"What makes this movie different is the amazing pace kept throughout what feels like a single hour but spans two and a half hours of content. Fincher is in complete control of every scene. The sound design gets a special mention and the soundtrack is very memorable. And of course we have that famous basement scene.But the movie is not without its problems. Two major issues clearly stand out:It's a movie and it's still self-aware. The writer had to give the viewer some form of conclusion and pins the murders on a very specific character. In reality, to this day the case stays unresolved and has baffled both the police and wannabe investigators.the movie adds unnecessary plot twists as part of an investigation that is already extremely complex. For example the scene where two cops let the perp walk because they were allegedly looking for a black male never happened. Likewise the scene in the park depicts two lovers when in fact they were simply friends.Considering how well executed the movie is one could easily forget these trespasses. But here's the problem: the movie prides itself in being historically accurate down to every detail. It might as well be shot in San Francisco in the 70s, has the VFX is simply perfect.So one has to wonder since these elements add nothing to the movie, why were they added? There's a reason behind every single decision in this movie and the viewer will have to decide for themselves.To a person unfamiliar with the case, an uninterested about the truth, I would say this movie is a 8 out of 10.But I am a sucker for the truth and I don't enjoy political points being inserted in movies that pride themselves in being accurate because holy weird says so.Good for a casual watch , that's about it. Which is a great shame considering how much work clearly went into it.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
"Zodiac Director's Cut is a masterpiece, beautifully shot and a must watch for true crime fans","Zodiac is directed by David Fincher and written by James Vanderbilt, the screenplay is based on the 1986 non-fiction book of the same name by Robert Graysmith.
The film tells the story of the manhunt for the Zodiac Killer, a serial killer who terrorized the San Francisco Bay Area during the late 1960s and early 1970s, taunting police with letters and ciphers mailed to newspapers. The case remains one of the United States' most infamous unsolved crimes. The producers spent 18 months conducting their own investigation and research into the Zodiac murders, which made the film authentic and more realistic as it should be with a topic like this one.
Phenomenal direction from David Fincher, his need for perfection was needed for this film as every single detail is there and it's realistic, rewarding as you appreciate the professional way they went into making this film.The main cast is three well known and acclaimed actors. Jake Gyllenhaal as Robert Graysmith, Mark Ruffalo as Dave Toschi and Robert Downey Jr as Paul Avery. The characters is real and are portrayed perfectly, Mark Ruffalo spoke with the real Dave Toschi and brought justice to his life story, getting the mannerism and behavior right. Jake Gyllenhaal did the same amount of work, interviewed Robert Graysmith to get all the mannerism and behavior down to do a perfect portrayal. This is probably one of Jake Gyllenhaal's best performances, he really does a great job and goes full into character.
The supporting cast has the likes of Anthony Edwards as Bill Armstrong and Brian Cox as Melvin Belli, there's a ton of other actors who each gives fantastic performances.Last time I watched Zodiac was with the theatrical cut, now years later I'm watching the director's cut and it was worth buying the blu-ray for that reason and all the special features that came with it. The changes only minor but it's how the director wanted it to be watched, you could easily watch the theatrical cut and find it as enjoyable, even calling it a masterpiece. The director's cut is only 5 minutes longer but those scenes will make you love the film even more. I strongly believe it is David Fincher's Magnum Opus, every single part of the film is superb, a mesmerizing cinematic experience. I know his passion project was Mank but Zodiac is better in every aspect, that's my opinion.The editing was perfect, Angus Wall did a remarkable job. The film's pacing fits well with the genre and to the movie, to be honest I would say this story would be better told as a TV Series as there's so much to cover but David Fincher succeeds with this 180 minute movie, nicely done to him and the team he worked with. They picked the most important parts of the investigation, a large amount of screen time is the investigation, but there's also character development throughout the film, some of the development is subtle.Harris Savides served as the cinematographer for the film, and the movie looks incredible, beautifully shot.
They captured the 60's and 70's perfectly with its sets, hair/makeup and costume department. Everything looks amazing, hugely thanks to its spectacular production design.This is possibly one of the best true crime films out there. It isn't about Zodiac, but about the people who investigated him. Journalists, detectives and the person who wrote the book that the film is based upon Robert Graysmith.
This film is a must watch, Zodiac is a masterpiece, and a movie I will continue going back to.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Zodiac Film Review,"People expecting to see another Seven will be disappointed, but that does not mean in any way that David Finchers newest thriller is not a success. Preoccupied with the bureaucracy's and failures of communication Zodiac deals not with the mind of the killer himself, nor the characters pursuing him, but instead focuses on the procedural department of this three decade spanning investigation. Instead of consuming their lives with the serial killer himself, the three main pursuers are engulfed in a battle with paper work and attempted county to county cooperation. What the film deals with is not the nail biting, stomach churning murders that Seven drew upon so well, but the actual procedures the Zodiac took in his killings. Unfortunately it seems Fincher chose to direct this epic crime drama of over two and a half hours without any of his visual style. With the exception of a handful of memorable shots including a shot of a letter inside a mail box being walked through a building until it reaches its receiver, and a brilliantly engaging shot that follows a taxi cab from a helicopter view, Zodiac seems very lackluster especially considering this is coming from the man who brought us the visually stunning Fight Club.Despite this visual setback, Zodiac never feels boring or contrived, and I cannot be sure yet if this was because of my interest in the case itself or due to Fincher's smooth direction. Either way the film must be praised for telling a story with no resolution and never getting lost in its own path. Trying to tell a story like this, of an unsolved murder case, is a perceptive look into the minds of the obsessed. It exemplifies how one man can psychologically blind people from the outside world concentrating all attention on himself. Again, many people looking for the suspense and blood shed they enjoyed in Se7en will be introduced to a new form of torture, which in this case is psychological.Jake Gyllenhaal plays Graysmith, a cartoon artist who becomes obsessed with the Zodiac case during his employment at the San Fransisco Chronicle. Gyllenhaal plays more of a supporting role in this, even though the trailers would like us to think otherwise. Mark Ruffallo, playing a detective out of Vallero county takes most of the screen time with his purposely low key voice, which seems to distract more than sooth as its striving intentions might want us to believe. Zodiac is more of collective cast adding Chloe Sevigny, Graysmith's wife dealing with his obsession and Robert Downey Jr. playing Paul Avery a reporter whose addiction to cocaine and alcohol must be a throwback to the actor himself. Obviously this powerful cast helps keep this film together as it follows its three act structure, making each character more important as one act ends and another begins. The first act deals with the media and their reactions to what appeared as legitimate threats. THe second act pushes into a bout with several detectives all dealing with same problem of miscommunication. And the third act introduces us to Graysmith's ongoing obsession with the unsolved murder mystery.Audiences falling in line for Zodiac expecting another Se7en are likely to be bored and disappointed overall. This movie is low-key and tasteful, avoiding any embellishments, and sticking to the facts of this case. Zodiac is not trying to scare people or even pull them into the world of a serial killer the way Se7en did so well. Instead this is a film about procedural's and communication, which might be a very distracting set of issues for someone to deal with, when going into a supposed thriller.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
"not your typical serial killer movie; it's mystery about mystery, and with plot not as paramount as character and mood","David Fincher is back in action after a five year wait that is, at least for me, well worth the gap. Zodiac tests the boundaries of what can really be done in a genre that by now- and ironically by Fincher's own doing with Se7ven being such a huge success- has almost run its course. He reinvigorates it in a very deliberate, powerful manner by making this true story, like JFK, about what it is to investigate, and how investigating something like a murder (or in this case murders) has to be unraveled in a way to get one not even enveloped as to the end result but the process. It's epic length, or at least at 156 minutes really feels epic in scope, and it was the right decision not cut too much more out than Fincher did. But with this time given he is able to pay in many a suspenseful scene, and- to make another famous cinematic comparison- like Lang's M really becomes more fascinated by the process of how to make a criminal investigation a purely cinematic endeavor. It's also one of the year's best films.One of the things, for example, that had me impressed was the structure, of how plot itself was meant to be intricate and with all of the points of a case made to be important- hence all of the 'two days later' or 'twelve hours later' or 'a year and a half later'. We're getting the bulletin points, sure, but its a specific choice in how to follow the two sides, those at the San Francisco Chronicle (with the primary leads being Jake Gyllenhall's Robert Graysmith and Robert Downey Jr's Paul Avery) and with the police department (Mark Ruffalo's Detective Toschi), and how they interconnect and lead off into making this one big puzzle. It becomes a puzzle to which Graysmith, who ended up writing a book about the murders that never really got a person convicted for the crimes, becomes absorbed to the point of blocking everything else out of his life. This happens actually four years after the last main batch of letters were sent by the zodiac killer to the press, but this too adds to the intrigue and possible futility of Graysmith's personal investigation. He's not a reporter, but it's not about getting the main even exactly caught, but to, as he says, 'look him the guy in the eye'. It goes without saying that everything evidence-wise in the case, of course, is circumstantial.Aside from being top-notch in the realm of intelligent police procedurals, as well as a story of investigative journalism gone awry, Fincher puts on his a-game visually as well. It might not have the overload of visual tricks and inventive gags that Fight Club had, but within what Fincher needs he makes the picture as strong a directorial feat as he's ever done, maybe even his second best. The control of mis-en-scene is one aspect, and it's appropriate to note the usage of the opening studio logos like the 60s/70s logos, as it sometimes feels like watching one of those movies, while, of course, commenting on them as well (i.e. Dirty Harry movie scene). And also the little shots that stick in your mind, like the aerial view on top of the Golden Gate bridge, or those shots with the zodiac's handwriting super-imposed montage style over the scenes. His control is ever present, but not making it unbearable either; it's all about the story here, and character, and he keeps the darkness in close, precise check, and makes it maybe even more effectively ""moody"" as a noirish thriller than Se7en.Now, as for Graysmith, he's the one that ends up bringing out what is for Zodiac that center of making it about the ""journey instead of the destination"" as the saying goes. That cliché shouldn't be something to snort at, however, as it's a journey where since we already know what will come at the very end suspense has to come out of situations, and out of the finding, losing, and possibly attainable commodity of information. It's almost one big comment on those results-oriented police pictures, and I often felt more gripped and interested in individual scenes, moments. Two of my favorite are when Ruffalo's detective and Koetas's officer interrogate Leigh, where you think you know conventionally 'this is the killer, this is him', but it is not...or is it? Fincher keeps one guessing, as well as in another scene where Graysmith visits the former organ player at the silent theater Rick Marshall, who may or may not be the killer, was the projectionist (when they go into the basement especially is a classically charged scene).And there are other factors that make it sensational as well. It's another turn by Downey Jr where there's subtleties that only he can bring to a character like the flawed Avary. Gyllenhall's also a perfect choice for Graysmith, where naive ambition and interest get conveyed well early on, and then equally believable as the one-track-minded private investigator who pushes buttons but gets results. And the soundtrack is especially a keeper, with ""Hurdy Gurdy Man"" used to awesome effect for the opening July 4th scene and in the last scene (it might even send chills down some people's spines). It's never too slick but always an inviting trip, and it questions what it is that a serial killer mystery should be while giving it flair and a personal mark of distinction as a work in and of itself. Who is zodiac? A form of evil, perhaps, and a form of evil that one might just want a glimpse of, if only, as opposed to the whole found and captured result.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Luna-tic fringe,"****SPOILER ALERT**** The movie ""Zodiac"" chronicles some 40 years of the statewide hunt for the notorious Zodiac Killer. The man who terrorized the San Francisco Bay area in the late 1960's up until his last ""chiper"" or coded letter back in 1978 and even beyond that.Having become the 20th century US equivalent of 19th century's England Jack the Ripper the Zodiac killer, who may be dead by now, may very well go down in criminal history as one of the most prolific and unidentified killers of all time.The movie ""Zodiac"" tries very hard to stick to the facts which makes it very hard to follow at times. Since the facts, unlike a number of fictitious movies about the same subject, are as confusing as the mysterious killer himself. About a month after gunning down at a local Vallejo Calif lovers lane Darlene Ferrin, who died, and Mike Mageau, who survived, the San Francisco Chronicle, or Examiner in real life, received this cryptic letter by the person who claimed responsibility for the shootings.The paper's ace reporter Paul Avery was put on the case but the pressure of tracking down and identifying the killer was just too much for him. Avery later ended up becoming one of the people on the Zodiac's hit list in a Halloween card that the killer sent him. This has Avery go off the deep end and end up a helpless alcoholic quiting his job and living on a boat where he eventually drank himself to death.It was the combination of the Chronicle's political cartoonist Robert Graysmith and SFPD inspector David Toschi who ended up picking up the ball that Avery dropped and ran with it in trying to find the killer. That had Insp. Toschi almost drummed out of the department in being accused, unjustifiably, of faking one of the Zodiac's letters! This, SFDP's internal affairs suspected, was in order for Insp. Toschi to get his superiors on the police force to give him more manpower and money to do his job.As for Graysmith he did uncover a number of clues about the Zodiac's identity, that he later had published in his best selling book, but they all for the most part lead to a dead end ! With the suspected killer, after being completely cleared by the San Francisco Police, dying some ten years later at age 58 of a heart attack. That was after, as seen in the movie, he was positivity identified by one of his surviving victims Mike Mageau in early 1991! You wonder why it took the SFPD all this time, some 22 years after he was gunned down, to get Megeau to identify by pointing the so-called killer, after he was exonerated, out in a grainy mugshot! When he could have done it by facing him in person, or in a lineup, while he was still alive and a prime suspect in the Zodiac killings!The Zodiac went on to murder at least two more people and seriously wounding a third, in a murderous knife attack,in the movie until he just faded out of sight! With only his occasionally cryptic letters sent to local newspapers keeping him on the front pages.It's been speculated that the Zodiac killer had murdered some 30 to 50 people since his admitted rampage against society began back in 1963; Six years before the Ferrin/Mageau shooting on July 4, 1969. But the Zodiac is only credited in the movie, and by the SFPD, of only 5 killings that's one less then those of the his New York City rival, in serial murder, The Son of Sam! This must have really hurt his already, with all the free publicity he was getting, very inflated ego as him being one of the greatest, together with the likes of John Gacy & Theodore Bundy, serial killers of all time!You really couldn't expect that much from the movie ""Zodiac"" since it's universally known that the Zodiac Killer has never been as much as identified or, if he's in fact already dead, caught and made to face justice for his crimes. The film in its over two and one half hours running time did educate its audience in how difficult it is, even with the most up to date and state of the art crime fighting science, to capture an intelligent and murderous psycho when he, despite his enormous ego, doesn't slip up and, like in most cases, lead the police straight to his front door!",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

Zodiac,"One of the few extraordinary, gifted directors continuing to make quality films is David Fincher. The man knows how to piece a story together and make long periods of dialog interesting. Watching Zodiac, I was so drawn into it that I really felt like wanting to solve a murder mystery. I can understand why Robert Graysmith dedicated his life to searching out the truth of the Zodiac killings. The initial kills are horrific and hooks the audience immediately, which leads to the chase. Just watching the film I knew the story had to be historically accurate because it seemed like I was listening into private conversations that happened years ago. The trio of stars, Jake Gyllenhaal, Robert Downey Jr., and Mark Ruffalo were superb characters and likable.

Excellent!,"This a top-notch crime thriller, and the best part about it is that it is true, which makes it even more compelling. I have studied this case somewhat extensively, and I was pleased to see how close the screenplay followed the book and the factual events as they occurred. There isn't a bunch of Hollywood ""fluff"" to try to add irrelevant entertainment or tricky plot lines in order to keep the viewer hooked. It was a long movie, but it didn't feel like it. In fact, I didn't want it to end, because I wanted to see if perhaps there were any recent developments that I was not aware of that were added to the story. The script was fast moving and the performances were great from the entire cast.

An unnerving masterpiece,"David Fincher's Zodiac is the finest film he has ever brought us, and one of the most gut churning documentations of a serial killer's crimes ever put on celluloid. Fincher has no interest in fitting his narrative into the Hollywood box or sifting through the details of the real life crimes to remove anything that doesn't follow established formula. He plumbs the vast case files and sticks rigidly to detail, clinging to ambiguity the whole way through and welcoming the eerie lack of resolution we arrive at with open arms. That kind of diligence to true life events is far more scary than any generic, assembly line plot turns twisted into stale shape by the writer (and studio breathing down their neck, no doubt). No, Fincher sticks to the chilling details religiously, starkly recreating every revelation in the Zodiac killer case with the kind of patience and second nature style of direction that leads to huge atmospheric payoff and a hovering sense of unease that continues to make the film as effective today as the day it was released. A massive troupe of actors are employed to portray the various cops, journalists, victims and pursuers involved with the killer during the 1970's in San Francisco, the film unfolding in episodic form and giving each performer their due, right down to the juicy cameos and bit parts. Jake Gyllenhaal plays Rob Graysmith, a news reporter who becomes intrigued and eventually obsessed with the cryptic puzzles which the Zodiac taunts the bay area with by sending them in to the paper. Mark Ruffalo is Charlie Toschi, dogged police investigator who is consumed by the hunt. The third leg of the acting tripod is Robert Downey Jr as Paul Avery, another journalist who takes the failure in capturing the killer a little harder than those around him. The film dances eerily along a true crime path populated by many people who veered in and out of the killers path including talk show host Melvin Belli (a sly Brian Cox) , another intrepid cop (Anthony Edwards), his superior officer (Dermot Mulroney) and so many more. For such an expansive and complicated story it's all rather easy to keep track if, mainly thanks to Fincher's hypnotic and very concise direction, grabbing you like a noose, tightening and then letting you go just when you feel like you have some answers. While most of the film examines the analytical nature of the investigation, there are a few scenes which focus on the killings themselves and let me tell you they are some of the most hair raising stuff you will ever see. The horror comes from the trapped animal look in the victims eyes as they try rationalize the inevitability, with Fincher forcing you to accept the reality of such acts. One sequence set near a riverbank veers into nightmare mode. Every stab is felt by the viewer, every bit of empathy directed to the victims and every ounce of fear felt alongside them. It can't quite be classified as horror outright, but there are scenes that dance circles around the best in the genre, and are the most disturbing things to climb from the crevice of Fincher's work. They're nestled in a patient bog of studious detective work, blind speculation and frustrating herrings, which make them scarier than hell when they do show up out of nowhere. Adding to the already epic cast are Jimmi Simpson, Chloe Sevigny, Elias Koteas, John Carroll Lynch, Donal Logue, Pell James, Philip Baker Hall, John Terry, Zach Grenier and a brief cameo from Clea Duvall. I think the reason the film works so well and stands way above the grasp of so many other thrillers like it is because of its steadfast resolve to tell you exactly what happened, urge you to wonder what the missing pieces might reveal should they ever come to light, and deeply unsettle you with the fear of the undiscovered, something which never fails to ignite both curiosity and dread in us human beings.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Limps along,"Sorry, but this did not do much for me. Some good actors, hence 6 out of 10, but it never really got going for me. Kind of stuttering storybook style of filming.

"""Down through all eternity, the crying of humanity""","The elements that complete a journalistic (or police) search / investigation, on a specific event, are direct and solid: When, Where, How, Who and Why. In the case of a murder, for example, the questions that one must ask are: When did the murder happen, in which location, what was the method the killer used, if possible, who was the killer and finally the motives that drew him in doing this action. In Zodiac, Fincher explores all the possible scenarios, from all the possible angles, from all the possible perspectives of everyone involved. His search is thorough, strict and to the bone. Nonetheless, the director deliberately refuses to directly encounter the motive of his invisible monster. Why did the Zodiac kill?""This is the Zodiac speaking.""In a world where Evil is predominant in every aspect of the modern life, the director dictates to his viewers that the why doesn't matter anymore. The modern Man has come to terms with the sick, the twisted, the wrong, the unjust and the morbid in his everyday life. There is no surprise that the Zodiac murders happened, it is simply enough to eliminate any possible (bureaucratic or not) procedure to catch this murderer, no matter if along the way an entire city, an entire country, an entire society looses sight of the ultimate goal: Catharsis of the soul. No one wants to look in his own closet to find the dusty skeletons, no one is ready to look in his own mirror, no one is prepared to accept the fact that this killer is a product of the society he built for his children to grow up into. But the film, bitter to the end, offers no illusions: In a cyclone of information and evidence (lost and found everywhere in a dead end game) this society has long left the green, green grass on the one side of the white fence and now carries on in a land where the only possible breakthrough is to make it until the next morning, and the next, and the next The characters that Fincher chooses to illuminate his enduring drama of the human condition are forgotten in an endless twister of data. Lost, as is deliberately, the viewer him self, cannot find an exit and the only thing left to do is slowly but steadily to self-destroy. Carriers and marriages collapse, children are left without fathers, women are left without husbands and the entire American way of life is put aside; only one thing matters now for the grey figures that represent the final descent of modern society into total darkness: Obsession. For two and a half hours an incredibly built scenario manages to make the viewer think of all the possible details that are presented before his very eyes. In this way the cunning and tragically ironic Zodiac achieves its purpose: Forget your emotions, forget your feelings, forget your humanity; this is the real world: numbers, dates, data, TV announcements, news broadcastings, newspaper articles and all this to let you know that you are no different from the three crusaders that utterly fail to their task (to fight for a beautiful world, that is simply not there). The world of the Zodiac is our world and the fortunate ones will make it to the next morning, feeling happy for them selves. As for the unlucky ones, the only dream left is that of the remembrance of a once bright, innocent and joy full era, maybe they read about it somewhere or someone told them it existed once. After all, they will have plenty of time contemplating about these things as they gaze the endless rainy grey of a never ending dusk of a dying world.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
"Could have been an 8, but isn't","I knew nothing about the movie before I watched it, except the genre, and that it scored an 8 on IMDb, so I expected a good movie.The movie has good suspense and credible characters. It is nice see how the police handled such a case in the late 60's and early 70's, and it is interesting and authentic.Unfortunately, the movie also has the pace of a movie of the 60's. I appreciate that a real case does not follow Hollywood timing rules, but when I realized (after an hour) that I had to sit through another 1.5 hour, it took most of the joy out of it. The movie could easily have been cut to under two hours. Irrelevant discussions and bad (often no) cutting drags this movie along.Also, the movie is extremely focused on the case. That might be good for the suspense, but the rest of the world seems to go by, and time goes by, and you see nothing of either, no context is drawn.Because of that, in the end it is just an average good movie and frankly it is quite forgettable.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

Fincher's most Underrated Film....maybe his best,"This might be the most underrated crime-mystery ever made. It's truly saddening that it doesn't even score an 8/10. I partly think that is because many people went into this thinking their would be more ""action"". This movie is a slow-burn, and if you go in knowing that, I think you will enjoy it much more. This is probably my favorite Fincher movie (yes, over Fight Club and Se7en). These events really happened, and are accurately depicted from what we know about the the Zodiac murders and investigation. I think that many people are upset that most of the ""scary"" scenes are over in the first 30 minutes, but the whole movie is scary in my opinion. I understand why the Zodiac is not shown often, because nobody truly knows much about him. Its clear Fincher didn't want to show the Zodiac much, because making assumptions about his crimes would take away from the accuracy he is trying to depict. If you know anything about the Zodiac Killer, than you know what the end result is going to be (SPOLIER?: They never catch him). But the way the police and Robert Graysmith (Whose book the movie is based on) go about trying to piece together one of the most enigmatic criminals of all-time is so interesting to watch. This movie gets you to look more into the Zodiac Killer when you're done watching. As the movie is based off of Graysmith's accounts, it gets you to favorite a particular individual as being the Zodiac. However, further research into these killings shows that there is just as much evidence that exonerates this individual as there is that incriminates him. This film is one of the best crime/mysteries/psychological thrillers of all-time. I truly think it is Fincher's most underrated film and possibly his best. If you know anything about the Zodiac crimes you will love this film, and if you don't, you will become another one of the civilian detectives who are trying to crack this perplexing case.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

A great crime puzzle...and one of Fincher's best films,"A crackling good crime story from director David Fincher, who meticulously mounts this impeccable and brutal true-life mystery with aplomb. A serial killer self-nicknamed ""The Zodiac"" is terrorizing Northern California in the late-1960s. Jake Gyllenhaal is solid as Robert Graysmith, a divorced dad with two kids who's employed at the San Francisco Chronicle as the resident cartoonist; he becomes completely absorbed by the newspaper's reporting of (and the police department's concurrent investigation into) the series of grisly murders happening in and around the Bay Area. The film, based on Graysmith's non-fiction book by James Vanderbilt, is intense and unsettling, packing reams of detail and criminal minutiae into its running time--most of which dead-ends or winds up discarded (in a case that was never solved). Excellent performances by all, including Mark Ruffalo and Anthony Edwards as the two principle police inspectors on the case, also John Carroll Lynch as a factory worker and potential suspect. Not for every taste; however, as a portrait of hard-working people obsessed with solving a baffling case that dragged on for decades, it's quite riveting. Amazingly, no Oscar nominations. *** from ****",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
This is Boredom Speaking,"Compared with Se7en and Fight Club, Zodiac plays like a thoughtful PBS documentary. Critics are praising Fincher for what appears to be a movement towards mature storytelling. Sorry, no sale.Individual scenes are gripping and, on occasion, suspenseful, but the gentle viewer must slog through mundane procedures that lead nowhere. Imagine a formless, three-hour CSI episode directed by Robert Altman, with no single character who takes the lead, no cohesive story arc, and no conclusion: there you have it, Zodiac.I can't blame David Fincher, per se, because the source material is so diffuse, and the purported central character, Robert Graysmith, is so weak and peripheral.

"Plot analysis of Zodiac motives, a true story","This film is an excellent documentary. Its method of documentary the past is excellent. The cinematography in color and sound is also excellent. The reasoning for camera angles is the key to telling this story, just as the motives of the Zodiac killer himself. A logical design within a design for a theatrical plot.I camera angle is intended to give the audience a perspective. The audience is what the director intends to persuade with his story-telling in audio-visual format. This is curious since the director of this film eludes to certain facts about the Zodiac killer's character such as listening to record playing music, the type of pistol used, the type of knife used. How was the record of history used? The logical motives of the Zodiac killer was to instill fear in the police by terrorism of children at random. Then supposedly he followed up with phone calls to file their complaint to the authorities. In this movie his complaint was that his lust for terror could not be satisfied no matter how many persons he killed. His lust for the method of killing was also a great influence to his motivation. The use of guns and knives physical violence, while it was communicated to the authorities by himself.Why did the killer use record music in this film. What was the killer listening to? The Zodiac was a clever code like any language. A logical code based on survival instincts, to feed a hunger. Not like a hunger for food, which was the one intent of the original Zodiac to depict seasonal change for farming. I was based on what we see in the sky, in the stars as direction in our lives. Maybe, he felt like the director in this film when he could hear the beautiful music at his command.The Zodiac killer is said to have enjoyed killing people more than wild animals. His intentions to conceal his identity within the Zodiac code is curious as the human nature of language itself. Why would both a phone call and written letters be used? Why not just one method of communication. The audio-visual nature of the communication process denotes a separation in the thought process into two motives. The psychosis of what is heard is admission, because the admission of enjoying human torture and death is also self annihilation. The visual code would indicate a second motive to conceal, or mislead, or further terrorism. As with both audio and visual a record can be made as knowledge, this record is his command of reality.The Zodiac Killer hence enjoys the record he is making of a command of death for humans, and his reality. Because there is some selection process. The Zodiac is human nature's way to determine direction, and time of year. It is at the time of the Zodiac Killer an international coordinate system that is codified as a science. Just as the criminal justice process was codified as a science. His killing tactics however, contradict both his motives and science. His killing tactics are based on terrorism, intimidation, and homicide. His command of science with the use of the Zodiac, writing, and the telephone suggest a logical modus. Hence a planned motive of audio-visual evidence.I note that given the time period of the Zodiac killer the use of the telephone was not known to be recorded as 911 calls are today for evidence. Or the science and technology for use was not public, thus expert witness of criminal justice system was manipulated to possibly expose some hidden secret of planned homicide and use of telecommunications for criminal justice.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
the journey not the destination,"You must see the Directors Cut. Fincher is one of the most unappreciated directors in the biz and Jake Gyllenhaal is one of the most under-used actors.

Unfortunately nothing dramatic happens and the last hour passes by very slowly. The ending, in my opinion, was even more tedious.

The Film with No Ending,"Named by many 'the film with no ending' is an ongoing mystery that nears towards its completion, before new twists, turns and puzzles are thrown in the way. Zodiac is a film that appreciates the masterful mind of the killer, rather than ordinary heroics of the PD.Robert Graysmith, a cartoonist by profession, finds himself obsessively thinking about the Zodiac killer. He uses his puzzle-solving abilities to get closer to revealing the identity of the killer.The significance of the film is that it keeps its viewers engrossed in its plot. The eerie unfolding of clues and events culminate to provide top-tier viewing, as well as the fast pace that the spectacle carries, keeping its forward movement and generating a high melodramatic piece to depict scenes of desperation, confusion and resilience. David Fincher's production consists of an extremely high-brow cast; Jake Gyllenhaal, Mark Ruffalo and Robert Downey Jr. Make their way into the picture, all of which offering unique attributes in acting to contribute to the movie's genius. Gyllenhaal's focussed and professional persona adds to the seriousness of the watch while Ruffalo's charm stems from his innocence and passion for his work, Downey Jr. Steps into a familiar role as the overly-confident genius whose charisma proves too much in an intense situation, driving himself out of the frame somewhat unfortunately.Bagging shy of $85 million in the Box Office, the mystery/thriller is a true embodiment of its genre. An excellent watch which knows the appropriate way to bend around an unsolved true story. The story is remarkable, so much so that the 'Zodiac' case was reopened after the film's release. In its gritty portrayals, scenes in the film are often dark and carry an uncanny feel to build tension and enhance suspense over the ongoing crime case. Stern looks, smooth exchanges and spine-chilling stories, Zodiac hits all the right notes in developing the general theme of 'uncertainty'.One of the greatest mysteries of all time is now one of the greatest film's of all time. An absolute classic.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
One of the Fincher's grates,"Zodiac is an incredible movie that leaves you asking questions.

It kept me on my toes the entire time and not many movies can achieve that.I don't really have any complaints with the movie except for not really liking Mark Ruffalo as an actor, but that again is a very personal thing. I think this movie is very underrated and hope many more people will see it as it is one of the Fincher's best.I give it 9/10 because of a not very likable but still believable Mark Ruffalo's character and not the best performance in the history of cinema from Jake Gyllenhaal.

Lacks Focus,"Fincher has certainly directed some classics such as Seven and Fight Club, so I came into this movie with high expectations. However he did do some things right. First off, the cast is fantastic, specifically Robert Downey Jr. Also, the movie transitioned well, considering how often it jumped time.But somewhere during the process of making this movie, Fincher got too ambitious. The movie is too long, there is too much focus on too many characters and too much varying information given. At some point, it changed left the realm of entertainment and became a video textbook on the Zodiac killings.

Zodiac goes nowhere,"If you thought Se7en and Fightclub were cool you probably want to go see the latest film from the same director, Zodiac. Let me warn you, you will be disappointed. Se7en had some amazing photography, true star power with Brad Pitt, and a blow-you-away twist ending. Zodiac has none of that.The photography is a departure from every other David Fincher film. Certainly it is less flashy. The style is stripped down, muted, simplified, and in my opinion, ultimately numbing.Although all the actors are competent, no one gives an amazing classic performance like Morgan Freeman in Se7en. None of the cast comes close to what Brad Pitt accomplished in Se7en or Fightclub. Pitt is just a more interesting actor to watch; Pitt has the ability to surprise you. Robert Downey as Paul Avery is fun to watch but you've seen him do this role before.All the actors in Zodiac seem to be playing the same note. The script doesn't help them. For example, we never really find out why the Zodiac case was so different for the Mark Ruffalo character, Inspector David Toschi, from any of the other murder cases he had seen. Why did it affect him the way it did?; we really never know. The Jake Gyllenall character, Robert Graysmith, loses everything to his obsessive pursuit of the Zodiac, yet it is hard to care about what he loses (his wife, his children as they leave him) since we hardly see him interact with his family.Each of the three main characters lives are badly developed. It is like watching the abbreviated version of the cliff notes depicting their lives. Zodiac shows what each character did and leaves out what each character was thinking and feeling. Characters are introduced and dropped for seemingly no reason. For example, why was Adam Goldberg's character ever introduced as Paul Avery's replacement? I never felt an emotional attachment to anybody in the film.As for the ending -- There is no ending. The movie just stops. You're led to believe that the Zodiac was probably a suspect whose handwriting and DNA samples didn't even match the evidence.The Zodiac case seemed to go nowhere and so does the movie.

To Catch A Killer,"In the late sixties, California is rocked by a serial killer who apparently embarked on an elaborate process of communication, using codes and cyphers to tease and taunt all those involved in either investigating or reporting the killer's alleged crimes. As time passes, the Zodiac case has a profound impact on a detective, a journalist and a newspaper cartoonist.Based on an allegedly true story, Fincher chooses to offer up a sprawling and episodic 'reconstruction-style' account of the case over a number of years, switching emphasis from one character to the next as all attempts to crack the case and reveal the truth are thwarted again and again. With harrowing depictions of the serial killer's crimes, and a meticulous attention to period detail, 'Zodiac' often reminds of Richard Fleischer's 'The Boston Strangler' (1968), and certainly the obsessive determination of police and journalists alike, and the challenges of investigating a crime across state and county jurisdictions are brilliantly realised.However, at over 158 minutes, Fincher's narrative, and the performances of his lead actors frequently fail to keep the viewer engaged - Ruffalo is a challenging actor to watch, and pairing him with Edwards as the two primary detectives assigned to the case brings this into stark relief. Edwards is a natural and unassuming performer, whilst Ruffalo 'acts' at all times, delivering his lines in the same, soft, mumbling and frequently unintelligible voice he uses in most of his films. This style works brilliantly in, say, Kenneth Lonergan's 'You Can Count On Me' (2000), but here, as so much verbal information being given to the viewer is key, we are often left wondering what was said. The same applies (although to a lesser extent) to Downey Jnr, whose investigative journalist is usually speaking from behind a cigarette clamped between his teeth. All very realistic, given all are playing 'real people', but pointless if the script cannot be heard or understood, especially as every actor seems to be battling against intrusive incidental sound effects such as type-writers, telephones or traffic. Gyllenhaal fares better as the geekish, and apparently not very good newspaper cartoonist who is gradually drawn into the investigation to the point of obsession, while Sevigny is quite captivating in the minor role of Gyllenhaal's girlfriend/wife.In the end, whilst 'Zodiac' is a fascinating and clever exploration of a real crime and its consequences in 60s and 70s America, it's hardly the gripping thriller it was marketed as, and given that we are being asked to follow and digest over two and a half hours of information relating to the investigation, holding the viewer at the mercy of actors who 'method mumble' whilst imparting this information is unforgivable.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

Dark paths,"A gripping thriller packed with tension, but what I really loved was how it immerses you in the era's vibe-the fashion, the music, and the pervasive fear carried by the public during that time. The cinematography is stunning, really evoking that gritty, paranoid feel of the '70s. The performances are top-notch, especially from Gyllenhaal, Mark Ruffalo, and Robert Downey Jr. They all bring depth to their characters, portraying the impact of the case on their lives and careers. What struck me most is the film's focus on obsession and the various ways it can consume people. It's not just a true crime story; it's a meditation on how the search for truth can lead down dark paths.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
One of the greatest all-time filmakers in full action,"Zodiac is about as close to perfect as film gets. I've seen the film twice within three weeks and I was drawn in like a fish hooked in to a rod each time. It's basically about the Zodiac killer, and the deep effect the case had on investigators.Instantly, from the first scene, we know Zodiac isn't pulling any punches. The murder scenes throughout are meticulously recreated with such intensity and suspense. The tone is just right, making it disturbing and perfect for the film. The actors all play the fantastically written characters beautifully, and the movie has some of the most memorable dialogue I've seen in film.While it starts at a slow pace, Zodiac presents one of the most interesting stories I've seen in film, culminating in a cathartic ending. I believe it is a modern gem of cinema.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
The Anti-Hollywood. And good.,"The Anti-Hollywood. And good.Seriously For ONE, There is no swooning alpha-male hero. Jake Gyllenhaal is a nerdy cartoonist who never grows out of his shell, Mark Ruffalo is an understated Inspector, and Robert Downey Jr. is a neurotic print reporter. TWO, there are no real female roles. Chloe Sevigny has the only significant screen time and she's relegated to a helpless housewife. And THREE, the story is rather unconventional. Unlike the title's suggestion, this film is really about a few people who become obsessed by the Zodiac and their ensuing triumphs and defeats. Once you stop expecting the typical Hollywood fare, it's easy to appreciate Director David Fincher's ""The Zodiac"" as a welcome change to the usual, unrealistic, predictable crap.www.manwithavan.blogspot.com",,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
"Smart and Stylish, BUT All Trees, No Forest","""Zodiac"" is one of the smartest and best produced movies in theaters right now. ""Zodiac""'s stars are terrifically talented men at the top of their games.Bonus: The script is full of unexpected witticisms that will make you laugh out loud.For all that, ""Zodiac"" lacks a center, and it lacks a point, which is a shame, because the point was right there, shouting at the filmmaker, who maybe just didn't realize it. ""Zodiac"" is all trees, no forest. It could have been a great movie; as it is, it is very good.First, what ""Zodiac"" does right: The production values are sky high. The film painstakingly recreates late 60s early 70s San Francisco.Jake Gyllenhaal, Mark Ruffalo, and Robert Downey Jr. are the very excellent big names in a cast that is, from top to bottom, first rate. Everyone here is simply wonderful, wonderful. Brian Cox is delicious and unforgettable as Melvin Belli. Robert Downey Jr. is seductive and painful as a drug- and alcohol-addicted, showboating reporter. Mark Ruffalo is very sexy as a tough cop.Each is given his pithy scene, his signature idiosyncrasy. Ruffalo eats animal crackers; Gyllenhaal is an Eagle Scout who drinks ""aqua velva""s, Downey lives on a houseboat.Everyone is so darn good you'll wish at least *one* of these very excellent performers had been given enough screen time to develop a character of some depth, and to move a coherent plot and theme forward.And there's the rub. There is no main character here. It isn't Gyllenhaal, whose do-nothing presence is simply awkward in his early scenes. You think, ""Why is Jake Gyllenhaal even in this scene? He's doing absolutely nothing..."" and then, forty minutes before this long movie ends, Gyllenhaal suddenly becomes the protagonist of a movie that feels very different from the first portion.That there is no real main character highlights another problem with the film. It has no point.Each individual scene is excellent. Each individual performance is excellent. There is a suspense scene: ""Are you sure we are alone in the house?"" There is a slasher scene - knife, stabbing, blood. There is a ""clueless chick in a dangerous situation"" scene. There are newsroom scenes and police headquarters scenes and ""judge denies warrant"" scenes. None of this adds up to any main idea, though.And that's too bad. The main idea was shouting and waving at the filmmaker: Zodiac craved publicity. He demanded that his letters be published in the newspaper. He killed for publicity. Did the newspapers that published him, gaining circulation and profits thereby, cause innocent human beings to die? By extension, do filmmakers like David Fincher, in making films like this, that make serial killers out to be glamorous and powerful, play any role in the loss of human lives? Serial killers tend to be losers and schlubs. they get away with what they do, to the extent that they do, not because of any great intelligence they possess; they aren't smarter than those of us who don't kill. They get away with what they do because of blind chance. They don't deserve to be made out to be larger than life.Fincher could have used the heavy artillery at his disposal: fantastic stars, a terrific script, intriguing real life events, to have given this film some weight, some gravitas, some center, some trajectory, that it currently lacks, had he explored these questions, questions inherent in the material itself -- a killer who demands the front page, and who promises he will kill if he does not get it.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Mind-wrapping murder mystery that goes beyond thrills,"If books, movies and television have warped our minds in any way, one way is that we crave this cathartic clarity at the end of every mystery story we consume. We have to know who dunnit or we go berserk and these media have taken our natural instinct and turned it into our expectation. One would suppose that ""Zodiac,"" a murder mystery based on the real, infamous killings of the late 60s and 70s in the San Francisco area, is one of those films, and in many ways it is--but it's something more. ""Zodiac"" is not so much a film about solving a mystery as it is about the obsession that fuels it.David Fincher, who directed perhaps the greatest murder mystery of the 90s in ""Se7en,"" returns to the genre again to direct the more biographical and fact-based ""Zodiac."" With Fincher's expertise, Zodiac becomes a mystery that sucks in all your attention, building suspense and--more importantly--your mental and emotional investment. Like Fincher's previous work, the cinematography is strong, (he collaborates with Harris Savides once again from 1997's ""The Game"") the lighting and shadows helping to build the mystery shrouding your every thought.Basically, the story is so thoroughly told, with no detail in the case spared, that you become obsessed. Robert Graysmith (Gyllenhaal), the San Francisco Chronicle cartoonist that took it upon himself to pursue the case when the leads fizzled out, is a victim of that very obsession, and therein is why this is a very good film. The main character and the viewers are completely in sync--we identify so easily with him, feeling all his frustrations, watching his family life start to crumble away.Sometimes, this amped up perplexity for the purpose of creating the viewer's own obsession, does sacrifice the film's other elements. There's only so close we can get to the characters (all who are played very well), like Robert Downey Jr.'s Tim Avery, drug-abusing Chronicle reporter, or Mark Ruffalo as police detective David Toschi. With our brains so focused on the mystery, part of the human element of this film is lost. These were real people and the victims of these crimes were actually victims. But such is Hollywood, and the mystery elements are a precedent for marketing the film. At least Fincher doesn't let them completely dominate, awakening us to our dangerous obsession of mystery-solving.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Interesting but not dark or thrilling,"I'll make this short and sweet. Zodiac engrosses you in the case. You find yourself drawn into it and keeping up with all the details. It's not ""exciting"" or ""thrilling"" like a more horror-oriented movie on a similar subject might be, but engaging; not deliciously dark or psychological like Se7en, but rather very realistic and analytical about the investigation itself. The acting is great; as many other people have mentioned, Robert Downey Jr.'s performance is notable, very similar to his persona in Wonder Boys. All the characters are likable or at least not dislikable. You even get a feel for the first few victims. You should already know this, but the Zodiac is not a cultivated, cultured, intellectual killer like Hannibal Lector or Kevin Spacey's character in Se7en; so don't expect that romantic or intriguing aspect of the killer himself. The movie does not focus on him, anyway. What else? It's very '60s- and '70s-ish. With a lot of movies that take place decades earlier, it feels kind of anachronistic despite the costumes, surroundings, and overall efforts to make it feel of the period it takes place in. Zodiac really does seem like it's set in the periods in which it's supposed to.I can understand people being bored with it, but it was engrossing for me, at least, and should be for people who don't go into it wanting it to be a thriller or a highly fictionalized sensational story or anything like that. I don't think the trailer is misleading in that respect - it is obvious the movie focuses on the investigation.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

We want our money back,"At the end of Zodiac my friends and I looked at each other and said, ""We want our money back.""In addition to the price of admission, we wasted almost three hours of our time on this long winded bore.At the center of the film is Jake Gyllenhaal's performance as a cartoonist obsessed with the Zodiac murders. None of us found him believable in the role.The movie lacks any kind of forward drive. It just sits there piling on pieces of circumstantial evidence. Sometimes the characters follow the trail of evidence to a dead end. Sometimes the evidence uncovered is just left behind and never followed up. Were the leads left behind by the characters or were they left behind by the filmmakers? You don't really know. The storytelling loses focus and we just stopped caring.So we'd like to ""thank"" everyone who gave this movie a 10 rating and influenced our decision to see this dull lifeless movie. Did you really think this was one of the best movies of all time? We actually thought it was one of the worst we'd seen in a long time.",1.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
True Crime Heaven,"Every true crime fan's idea of heaven, as Fincher explores the unsolved Zodiac murders of the late sixties. The recreation of the era is sensational and casting top notch, with Gyllenhaal and Ruffalo outstanding. Downey provides his usual Downey tics and idiosyncrasies pre-Iron Man, while the A grade support cast expertly wanders around in the background.The police and newspapers are baffled as the Zodiac killer is sending cryptic letters and complicated cyphers to both confuse and taunt the cops. After the letters stop and the case seemingly goes cold, cartoonist Gyllenhaal decides to solve the mystery himself.Fincher clearly believes the prime suspect here was the killer, but the film is so good, it almost doesn't matter. This is a masterclass in filmmaking from the master himself. Will have you googling about Zodiac for weeks. 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Just plain dull,"It's eternally fascinating to see what folks will do for dollars. Right from the start, the movie is laughable and ridiculous schlock.In The Box a financially struggling family in 1976 are given a weird box and told they have 24 hours to decide if they will press the button on the box that will result in them getting 1 million dollars and the death of somebody completely unknown to them.The Box takes a premise, muddles it up and makes it completely ridiculous. The movie tries to tackle the big themes of human nature and our place in the universe but it never delivers. The actors are fine, but the weak plot is blotted by an unbearably slow paceThis creepy thriller movie too is way too confusing for kids and just plain horrible for adults. Still, most kids won't want to bother figuring out the movie's dark themes and plot, so do yourself a favor, think twice about giving into curiosity and leave The Box's button untouched it's so bad, it's funny.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Strict and professional crime reasoning film,"Strict and professional crime reasoning film, the whole film logic is not obvious omission, the plot loopholes I can only recall one, is the film at the beginning of the deathless juvenile, in the final identification, but when the police caught Leigh, where was he? The result is so realistic and cruel. If there are shortcomings, it should be rhythm and clues. The film is slow and lacks ups and downs. Especially in the first half, the events progressed slowly, the characters were numerous, the clues displayed were complex, and the narrative perspective switched back and forth. After the failure of Leigh's arrest, the plot grew rapidly. The cartoonist was locked in the main view, but he could not fill every pit. Especially if the case has not been solved, it has left too many clues.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Very good but slightly disappointing  story of the Zodiac killings,"David Fincher dives into the Zodiac killings in San Fransisco. Disorienting only in that this is more or less a straight telling of how three men's lives were changed by the killings. The cast is a cross the board excellent with Robert Downey Jr a stand out as the reporter who sinks into alcoholism as the elusive case gets away. Following Robert Greysmith's book on the story fairly closely this is a gripping tale that will annoy some people since, and its not rally giving anything away, there is no definitive ending. The killer isn't caught, though a suspect is named. For me the problem is tied together in the fact that we are asked to give up three hours of our lives to a story that has no, and will probably never have, final solution. While the lack of an ending makes you feel much like the characters on the screen it also annoys you and makes wanting to return to the film again not something you'd look forward to. Don't get me wrong, I really like the film a great deal (I've read a lot on the killings) I just wish they had managed to find a more satisfying way to end the film so I'd have a reason to go back to it sooner rather than later. Definitely worth a look, just prepared for a ""thats it"" feeling even with the end text.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Tremendous,"I was gripped throughout this superbly handled thriller, based on true events. Well written and with a great cast, Zodiac has a narrative which never fails in what can be a complex story and holds the attention for its 2h40m running time.

A must see.,"""Zodiac"" is crime/drama film directed by David Fincher, and it was released all the way back in 2007. A decade ago! Dang, that is hard to believe. Anyway, I wasn't able to see ""Zodiac"" when it initially released in theaters and really I had never even thought about it until I saw it got added to Netflix this month. I immediately added it to my list and finally got around to watching it. ""Zodiac"" may not be as good as ""Se7en"", and it's definitely not the best crime/drama movie ever made, but it's still pretty damn good.PlotAs you might have guessed based off of the title, ""Zodiac"", the movie is all about the Zodiac killer, and the people who try to figure out the identity of the killer. I won't go too deep into spoilers, but if you were alive when the Zodiac killer was actually active or if you have read the book, you'll know at least some of the story. Essentially, there's a serial killer on the loose in California and he likes to taunt the press/police after he successfully commits a murder. The movie follows the detectives, a journalist, and a cartoonist as they try to figure out who the killer is. I wasn't alive during that time, and I never read the book or do any research on the subject. So this was a whole new story to me, and I feel like I benefited because of that. The entire time I was trying to figure out who the killer actually was. The director does try to throw a few curve balls at the audience, but I feel like they were almost unnecessary and actually hindered my final assessment of the film. Not that throwing curve balls at the audience is necessarily a bad thing, but the twists just weren't executed all that well.Anyway, the story kept me enthralled from start to finish. I was completely invested in the investigation by about the half-way point. I didn't look at how much longer was left in the movie once, and I even put off going to the bathroom because I did not want to pause the movie. That's how into it I was. One challenge that Fincher really overcame was the time line. This movie spans a lot of years. And sometimes that can harm a film dearly. Jumping weeks, months, years at a time can sometimes kill a film's momentum, and lose the audience in the process. But this movie doesn't do that. It can jump weeks or months and you'll hardly even notice. It never loses momentum and it never becomes a drag.Overall, the story of ""Zodiac"" is incredibly gripping and well done. Fincher does a great job of making a ""cold case"" into a movie that actually has a resolution that is satisfying, and he is able to make even the boring stuff seem interesting.CharactersAlmost all of the characters in ""Zodiac are great"". They're engaging, unique, and have great arcs. But Paul Avery, who is portrayed by Robert Downey Jr., is the weakest character of the entire film. I get that Fincher was a bit hogtied when it came to each character's arc, but man what a waste of Robert Downey Jr. His character has a pretty small role in the film in the grand scheme of things and doesn't actually add a whole lot to it. He drinks, he smokes, and he helps the case along a little but for the most part he's just there. And it gets to a point in the film where he's completely unnecessary, but they give him a few scenes anyway. I mean, ""Zodiac"" is a long film, so cutting out these excess scenes with his character would have trimmed at least a few minutes off of the 2 hour and 37 minute run time. But it is Robert Downey Jr. so I guess they didn't want to cut any of his scenes. Now, I want to make it perfectly clear that Paul Avery doesn't hinder the film or impact it in a negative way. He just doesn't add a whole lot to it and overall seems unnecessary. The rest of the characters are great, though.Potential Audience""Zodiac"" is a mature film. The first half of the movie contains quite a few murder scenes, and I would say that no one under the age of 16 or 17 should watch it. Heck, some people well into their 40s may find some of the scenes in this movie disturbing. It all depends on how much ultra-realistic violence actually impacts you. If you like crime, drama, or thriller movies you'll definitely have a good time with ""Zodiac"". Just don't let your young child watch it.Conclusion""Zodiac"" is a great film. The story is a quite the ride and the characters keep you engaged. The film does run a bit long, but because the story is so fascinating I doubt you'll even notice how long it truly is. If you have Netflix, go watch it as soon as you can. If you don't have Netflix, go rent it for a couple of bucks–it's worth it.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Good for smarter people?,"I am not the target audience here. I am not smart enough for Zodiac and I have zero problems admitting that. I do like me a good serial killer movie/documentary though. This movie is 2,5 hours long. The first 1,5 hours, I felt, nothing really happened. It wasn't bad or anything but apart from seeing some of the killings and the messages the zodiac sent, it basically a 1,5 hour setup of the premise the way I see it. That's too long. Then, suddenly it goes from 0 to 100. I get a boatload of information all at once in quick succession with characters talking really fast. That's the part where I'm not smart enough. I can't follow a lot of it (most of it). Based on what I did see and understand, there simply isn't enough information on this subject for a an engaging movie. I would have rather seen a shorter documentary on the subject.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Too Long and Boring,"In the late 60's, a couple of teenagers is brutally murdered by a killer while dating nearby a lake in California. This is the beginning of a series of murders, with the criminal sending letters to the newspapers with riddles and promising more murders while the police force and journalists investigate the crimes trying to find suspects.I have recently seen Alexander Bulkley's ""The Zodiac"", which is based on the true events of the serial-killer Zodiac, and I found it a reasonable movie. Today I have just watched most of the 158 minutes running time version of David Fincher with my wife and when I did not sleep, I found it painfully long and boring (my wife agree with my opinion and she slept less than me). It is amazing that this overrated movie needs 158 minutes running time to tell the same story that ""The Zodiac"" tells in 97 minutes. If the viewer has insomnia problem, try to see this film instead of using sleeping pills because it will be more effective. My vote is four.Title (Brazil): ""Zodíaco"" (""Zodiac"")",4.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

"way too long, and yet interesting","Something interesting happened while I was watching 'Zodiac'. I am not a big fan of the 'true crime stories' genre, and this film suffers from the 150+ minutes disease which seems to have spread widely in Hollywood. By the end of the first 30 minutes I was lost in the many details of the Zodiac serial killer case, and 30 minutes later I was on the verge of falling asleep, after all this is the maximum duration I can hold on similar themed TV series, and then I usually go to bed.It is not that it is not a well made film. I was amazed to read comments from viewers and critics about David Fincher having made a 'regular' movie. Maybe the subject seems to be so, but the cinema work is sophisticated - as we advance from the late 60s to the 80s the digital camera reconstitutes the light, the clarity, and the palette of colors of the films of that time. So subtle that it neighbors geniality.Yet the detective story is the weak part of the movie. Trying to be true to facts, it does not create enough tension, details accumulate and blur one another, and taking into account that most of the viewers know the story they are simply not enough interesting for more than half of the movie.An then something happens. You realize that the movie is no longer about the crime or the criminal, we know all that is worth knowing about those, but about the men trying to find the truth and about the obsession that brings them on the verge of the destruction of their families or even self destruction. Acting certainly helps, with Jake Gyllenhaal, Mark Ruffalo and Robert Downey Jr. each giving such a top performance that the next year Acadmy nominating committee will have a hard time choosing whom to bring to the big evening in L.A. Seeing Jake Gyllenhaal for example I had a flashback three decades back with Richard Dreyfuss building mountains in his living room to prepare the close encounter. One can say that this film is much too long, so long that it ends by being interesting.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Another real-life story told by the great Fincher,"A very atmospheric movie, it was solid on all counts but if one ought to compare it with other works of David Fincher, then it didn't even come close! Take the example of the movie Se7en (1995) another Fincher film with the subject of a serial killer, superior in every aspect; 5 minutes into the movie and you're so emersed by the music and street sounds and the rain and everything, you forget that you're sitting in the cinema, hell you forget even who you are!! I wanted Zodiac to be of the same fabric but unfortunately, it wasn't.Although Robert Downey Jr. And Mark Ruffalo both played very decent jobs, the movie mainly evolved around the other character, the nerdy cartoonist played by Jake Gyllenhaal. And hear me out it's a big flaw for a mystery/thriller film to have its focus only one guy, criteria which were masterfully mended in the Se7en, start to the finish, and in every scene, the tension to steal the focal point is present between characters, and to this day I can't tell you who was the main in that movie.Only if Fincher didn't raise the bar too high =))",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

An excellent film of its genre,"It's good to have an unorthodox film for once. This is a film that will keep you guessing all the way through till the end. The performances by the cast reflected the characters with decency. I think this is because people still know those involved in the Zodiac murders, and the actors probably even got to meet those still alive. Therefore the cast had little to scope to, experiment, or make the character as full as, Hugh Laurie's Greg House, or Eugene Levy as Jim's Dad in the American Pie series. It would be totally inappropriate.I enjoyed the film, especially the soundtrack. The cinematography was excellent, especially following the taxi along the city streets, turning with the vehicle making it seem as if I was playing a computer game, like Grand Theft Auto.Mark Ruffalo for me did performed best of the actors, even though I feel he was trying to appear like Peter Falk's Columbo with that rain coat! I was expecting him to say,"" and just one more thing."" ""I got it here somewhere."" Or drag on a stale cigar!I must admit, (and hence why I scored it 7 out of 10,) I felt the ending dragged. This is something I don't feel will be a problem when the film comes out on DVD. But in the cinema I did get conscious that I had been sat still for a while, and the pace of the film in the last quarter slowed down.Overall a good film.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Zodiac,"People will point to Se7en or Panic Room as David Fincher's best work, but I like to think Zodiac is his magnum opus. I'm fascinated with the Zodiac killer, and the string of terror he brought in his time. Its riveting, and I think the film portrays many of the real life events very accurately. Fincher's other films are great, but none encompass the spectrum that Zodiac does. Zodiac works as a period piece, police drama, a newspaper drama (if that's even a subdivision), and a thriller. I need to get around to reading Robert Graymsith's book. Feel like the film kind of flew under the radar in 2007, it unfortunately bombed in the box office and I think it deserved at least a Best Picture/Director nod at the Oscars.

Another Work of Art by Fincher,"I love David Fincher, I really do. I have never been disappointed by a film he made.I only heard a negative review about this movie, so in watching it I was a little skeptical. The bad review basically criticized its length, but I only believe that could be a problem if the viewer is not lending their full attention to the film. Yes, it's long-but yes, it's high quality stuff, so it doesn't matter. It's genuinely interesting. Not only does it show the legitimate processes of detectives in pursuit of a serial killer, but it shows the lives behind the pursuit. It shows the children of, the marriages of the police officers and the reporters. It gives insight to an aspect of crime that you can't find in real life unless you're a police officer or a reporter yourself. The characters, based upon real people, are just that: real. It's refreshing. There was not one actor that I was disappointed in, not one person presenting amateur acting to disrupt the illusion.The plot was interesting, of course, as all films searching for a serial killer are. It was frustrating at the same time, not knowing who it was, but that's characteristic of all films in this genre. Not a complaint, just an observation. It wasn't tiring, it didn't drag on. Although there were frequent disappointments in the story (not in the telling, just the actual happening), but I didn't feel them because Fincher is so good. The way that he told this story was brilliant. This is not a waste of 2+ hours, this is full of information regarding a true and unsolved crime. It's actually educational.Visually, it was beautiful. Fincher got beautiful shots, beautiful angles, beautiful colors, as always. Even if you don't like the actors, the story, the dialogue, you can still like the movie because it's just really nice to look at. Fincher also controls which emotions he wants to evoke, which is great. He's successful in it. If he wants to get you scared, he will. If he wants you to laugh, be disappointed, frustrated, he will. He is excellent.I was very satisfied with this film. It was informative, interesting, disturbing, and the conclusion wasn't awful or anything. It was a good ending, honestly. I want to buy this movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Engrossing but overlong,"Zodiac is often compelling, with solid performances, a good sense of place, some really disturbing and suspenseful moments and a great soundtrack. It is also much too long, as though made by someone so enamored with its story that they couldn't bear to cut a single moment from it.While this movie recreates in distressing detail the killings of the serial killer known as The Zodiac, for the most part it is an investigative movie along the lines of All the President's Men, one fascinated by evidence and research. The difference is this movie is also heavily focused on obsession.The acting is good, particularly Jake Gyllenhaal as a jittery cartoonist who becomes obsessed with the case. The investigation itself is involving, although at times it can be hard to keep up with the steady stream of clues that lead investigators running around.Still, it's too long, and it doesn't feel like it's a movie that *needs* to be this long to tell the story. In fact, while I really liked Robert Downey Jr.'s performance, his character wasn't especially necessary to the story being told; he should have been a fairly minor character. That could have cut a half hour off the running time without losing anything essential to the story.Even though it's too long, though, it's worth seeing.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

One of the most underrated films of all time,"Zodiac is by far one of my most favorite film of all time and I always consider that this is by far the best film of David Fincher. I also think that this is one of the best non-fiction film. There is a lot of things to praise on this film but first the summary of the film. 
SUMMARY: This film is all about the real case of the Zodiac killer who killed in the San Francisco Bay Area at some time around the late 1960's and early 1970's and the investigation and the manhunt that came along with it. It also follows the journey of Robert Graysmith (played by Jake Gyllenhaal), a cartoonist at the San Francisco Chronicle who got interested in the case and tried to investigate it. This film is based-off of the 1986 book ""Zodiac"" that was written by Robert Graysmith.
Everything about this film works. The cinematography, performances, pacing, direction, just everything. In fact, I think this is far better than the another film of Fincher that is also one of my favorite which is Seven (1995). Fincher grew more subtle in the years and you can tell that when you watch Zodiac. It's not some they will just shootout all of a sudden, cheesy car chase scenes, etc.. The film is actually almost true to it's original source. It's a real investigation film about a serial killer. In fact, it's not so much about the Zodiac killer but is about the obsession of the leading actors to search for the Zodiac killer. Speaking of leading actors, best performances by Mark Ruffalo, Robert Downer, Jr. and especially by Jake Gyllenhaal. They were great at this film as you can tell. The direction is also great, David Fincher is one of my most favorite directors of all time. But the best thing about this film is its pacing and its cinematography. This might not work for some other people, some might complain the pacing is too slow or very methodical. It's because the film takes its time and it doesn't just rush it all. Personally, I found the pacing of this film great, it makes me feel also obsessed of finding out the identity of the Zodiac killer. The cinematography is mesmerizing, it almost feels hypnotic. The cinematography of Harris Savides is a great thing. Another thing to praise is the use of visual effects and CGI (computer-generated imagery). Fincher wanted to be this film to be as accurate as much as possible even the setting of this film. The visual effects of this film feels seamless, I didn't even doubt that there was CGI involved and when I found out that they actually used CGI, I was shocked. The music of this film is also great, it's very subtle. It's overall a great film and is definitely a must-watch film. I think this is the one of the best masterpiece of all time.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

The movie is based in the early 60's which gave you more of the feel when it actually happened this movie was very well done and the acting was good i would watch it again but like i said not anytime soon.i would like to see Jake Gyllenhall and Robert downy JR do another movie like this together,6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

Purely Fincheristic,"An intense, albeit slow, telling of the story of the Zodiac killings, this movie transports its audience back to the 60's and 70's, and makes them relive the tension and paranoia that shrouded the lives of the public back then. The Zodiac Killer was active during those days, a serial killer who would leave codes and mail ciphers and letters to the newspapers, gloating over his kills. It follows the story of the young cartoonist Robert Graysmith, played by Jake Gyllenhaal, for whom hunting down the Zodiac became a morbid obsession and remained so long after the case had gone cold and the police had stopped hunting him down. It also follows the lives of Inspector Toschi (Mark Ruffalo) and Paul Avery, the first journalist to take an active interest in the Zodiac killings (Robert Downey Jr.). The film-makers have shown as accurate a picture as possible on celluloid, basing their stories on the book by the real-life Graysmith. This is a must-watch for all those who love the crime- thriller genre. It has an ending that leaves the audience wanting to believe something, but not being sure.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

But i don't wanna tell the whole story and that would spoil the film. I suggest you go see it for yourself, i suppose.David Fincher really has something in mind. He thinks of a better movie for the fans and It's like he did this with his eyes closed and got an A+.I wouldn't call this a marvel movie with Iron Man, The Hulk and Mysterio trying to solve a mystery.

A lengthy investigation...,"All in all, I did enjoy this film! I am a big fan of investigative films, and this one was 100% that. Viewers should be warned to watch when fully awake; the pace can seem a bit slow at times. However, those moments are chocked full of stellar acting and smart dialogue. I was most interested in learning about the happenings of the Zodiac Killer and the search for him. Being born in 1999 ruined any chance that I could have been privy to any original news coverage, so this was an information gathering viewing for me as well. All in all, the performances were good and I was curious to see the culmination of the main characters time and effort. Perhaps this is an unpopular opinion, but my favorite performance was that of John Carroll Lynch! He never fails to make me feel uneasy on screen when playing a (suspected) killer.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
A police account,"As a time-honored director and with a significant number of good films behind him, David Fincher ventures once again into treating an assassin, this time the Zodiac in a film of the same name.
It is inevitable to resort to comparison with another similar work on his part, 'Seven'. The difference is evident, the first being an almost horror film, while 'Zodiac' focuses on the police thriller.
It is outstanding how David Fincher manages to create an atmosphere throughout the film. An atmosphere of uncertainty and above all constant tension. It is a merit how he manages to maintain tension and suspense for such a long time or how sequences in full light can be disturbing. Fincher achieves this through the dialogues, which are absolutely well thought out to develop the narrative of the film.
In retrospect it could be said that 'Zodiac' is one of David Fincher's best works because of the way he treats a murderer in a different way than usual, with a slow narrative and dialogues that only cause a feeling of increasing tension during the more than two hours of film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
A thrilling real-life mystery,"This was a movie that I didn't expect much of and thought would be carried by the brilliant cast, turns out the movie was so engrossing that I forgot they were actors, and considering this is based on true events makes it so much more terrifying. They went well with the horror aspect as the directing of David Fincher kept me on the edge like most of his movies. Also, the fact that the movie was the primary reason for reopening the Zodiac case is a good thought. Though the movie genuinely had me on edge most of the time, Jake Gyllenhaal's addictive style of acting where he plays a man who's addicted to his job is really exciting to watch.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
One of the best true crime movies of all time,"Of the many true crime movies to come out of Hollywood, Zodiac is among the best of the best. Excellently retelling the hunt for the elusive serial killer. Performances are strong throughout the film. Fincher was the best choice for the film, since he understood what the stakes in the case were. The choice of not seeing the killer is a brilliant choice since we don't know what the man looked like. The newsroom scenes feel like they're brought to life and the call scene is one of the most chilling scenes in a film. Also, this film is nowhere near as exploitative as other stuff like Dahmer. Instead, it treats the victims like human beings. A definite recommend for true crime fans and for people who want to continue Fincher's filmography.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

It felt more like a made for T.V. special on PBS rather than a real film,"When it comes to making a film based on an event like the ""Zodiac killer"", there comes a question in which most filmmakers ask themselves, ""Should the film be more factual or more fictional?"" Hand's down, this movie is by far more fact than fiction! David Fincher, best known for ""Seven"" and ""Panic Room"" brings to life the chain events, covering over a twenty year time frame, of the five vicious murders that happened in the four districts of Western California. The movie goes in-depth with police detectives who investigated the crimes, and the reporters who queried and tried to seek the actual killer. The ensemble cast of Mark Ruffalo, Jake Gyllenhall, Robert Downey Jr., and Anthony Edwards are excellent.The combination of the accurate stories and the cast members make a great film, but ""Zodiac"" needed more than that. It needed a thrilling pace like ""Panic Room"". The first hour of the film was steady, but after that, the film dragged and drifted from different scenes about prank callers, kooks on the street who claim their the ""Zodiac killer"", and far-fetched theories that both the police and the news reporters try to figure out with absolutely no luck.I grew very bored. For awhile, I felt like was watching a ""made for T.V. special on PBS"" rather than a movie. However, the last twenty minutes of the film followed into the suspense that Mr. Fincher is very well known for and he managed to tie a fair amount of the knots at the end, leaving some plot holes. I honestly felt there wasn't enough mysterious drama or suspense to make the movie a real good thriller.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
"Endlessly absorbing, technically impeccable, and intelligently told, Zodiac is a marvelous thriller","Both on a technical level and as a smart thriller, Zodiac absolutely blew me away. I see shades of its influence on another of my favorite movies, Villenueve's Prisoners, and Fincher's wonderful show on a similar subject matter, Mindhunter. Zodiac is a fair account of a true story, which only makes it that much more remarkable. At its heart, Zodiac is really a tale of the men who are trying to catch Zodiac and in particular Graysmith's obsession with finding him. Especially having read I'll Be Gone In The Dark, a true crime book of one woman's determination to catch another notorious California killer, I can appreciate the way these types of seemingly random and unprovoked murders uniquely strike fear into the hearts of citizens. The movie even explicitly mentions this - look at how many people get murdered every year in San Francisco; the Zodiac killer is a blip on the radar in the grand scheme of things. And yet, that looming threat is truly scary, which Fincher plays with brilliantly by ratcheting up the tension late in the movie when we aren't sure what the Zodiac killer will do or if he will appear. The film centers on four main characters who end up having their careers be consumed by the Zodiac case: one is exhausted and transfers, one loses reputation, one becomes a drunk, and one becomes so obsessed as to neglect his family and job. All of the acting is great, I really love Ruffalo as the cop, but Gyllenhaal once again steals the show for me and elevates this movie to even greater heights. We see his puzzling, obsessive nature from the very start, and it's at once inspiring and heartbreaking to see him pursue the case relentlessly when everyone else gave up on it and thinks he's crazy. The third act is superb, as the tension rises and we see the case from the perspective of Graysmith. The basement scene was the tension peak for me, but the entire ending is just spot on. The single long look Graysmith gives in the shop is the most cathartic ending we could get. It's a long movie but doesn't drag for a second. The direction and performances are excellent, and there is plenty to consider from all perspectives: police, journalism, serial killer psychology, and society. I'll be overjoyed if I watch a better movie this year (looking at you Tenet).",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Truly Amazing,"A brilliant film based upon the concept of obsession. A slow burning thriller 'Zodiac' is on another level. There's moments of almost slapstick violence which are slightly world breaking but those are forgotten in moments of pure tension which occur in the later stages of the film, creating elements of total horror the film is an extremely satisfying watch that's well worth your time (even if it's well over 2 hours)",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
New Hollywood strikes again,"Perhaps the reason why I liked Zodiac so much is because it's like a content, legitimate child of Pakula and Stone: All the President's Men without paranoia and JFK minus the conspiracy. Very much a 'talkie', but also a careful, almost elegiac study of America that lost its innocence, bypassed by summer of love and jaded by Watergate. Where Pakula would have build up uneasiness and Stone spirals of suspicion, Fincher lets time and inefficiency do the work and every suspense gets counteracted by series of anticlimaxes. Fincher never lets us focus for too long on either one character or a suspect, throwing sly hints here and there that lead nowhere, and we are back with our good, obsessive guys, suspending the paranoia once again. Impeccably directed, shot and edited, this film is a rare delight of attentive storytelling (only once, about three quarters in, somewhat forgetting Glynnehall's character, which could probably be attributed to compromised editing).Another thing that is worth mentioning is how rarely one encounters a period drama that doesn't overwhelm with period details. Apart from astonishingly faithfully recreated photography, in its warm brown and yellowish hues, soundtrack is as an unobtrusive and historically discreet, all fuzzy, sticky funk and r'n'b, eerie pop loop of Lynn Anderson and Donovan's Hurdy Gurdy Man in particular lending a sinister and ironic touch.A special mention goes, among all really great cast, to Anthony Edwards for continuing where Kevin Costner got distracted by megalomania and Robert Downing Jr for not over-camping it.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

There's more than one way to lose your life to a killer,"This 2007 David Fincher film is based on Robert Graysmith's book which was adapted for screen by James Vanderbilt. Graysmith was a cartoonist working for the San Francisco Chronicle Newspaper at the time of the Zodiac murders in the late 1960's, early 1970's. Officially the Zodiac killer was never identified and caught by Police and to this day remains a mystery. While working at the Chronicle, Graysmith became fascinated with the case, and even after the Police gave up trying to find out who the serial killer was, he was hooked in the hunt. Graysmith eventually went on to write a book about the subject, detailing his experience and the evidence he found. The book is the subject for this film.Starring Jake Gyllenhaal stars as Robert Graysmith. There are quite a few other big names in the film; Mark Ruffalo and Anthony Edwards play two of the main police inspectors, Robert Downey Jr. and Brian Cox work at the newspaper, with Downey Jr. playing Paul Avery who took the lead on writing about Zodiac. Also, in the cast are actors like John Terry, Chloe Sevigny, Donal Logue, and John Carroll Lynch - all of whom give great turns in their roles.This is not your average Hollywood serial killer/ cop film. With it being based on fact Fincher tries to concentrate on what is known rather than what makes an exciting scene for the audience. So, you will not find typical high intensity action; no car chases scenes using typical San Francisco roads, no shoot outs between good guy and bad guy. There are only really two, maybe three scenes in the movie which show events from the killer's point of view. Usually this is a standard trope of such films so the audience can create a connection to the characters, even if it to recognise that the audience are watching the 'bad guy'. This film does not do that, when the killer is present you do not see their face. The closest you get it when potential suspects are shown later in the film. The film is more a character driven film, showing how people who were involved (particularly Downey Jr, - the reporter, Gyllenhaal - a cartoonist/ obsessive, and Ruffalo - the lead investigator) in the story handle it. The events and investigation wore some people down, some turned to drink and drugs, some people became highly motivated, some frustrated - everyone who was touched by the happenings surrounding Zodiac were affected in some way or another, even none central players who just happened to be living in the city lived a life of fear for a period of time, which came across in the film. For this reason, the movie tag line gets it spot on, suggesting ""There's more than one way to lose your life to a killer.""With a runtime of 157 minutes this is a very long film. Bearing in mind that its a character driven and development film there are times where those 157 minutes seem to be dragging on a bit with lots of dialogue. This could perhaps have been cut down a little, but from what I have read, Fincher already cut parts out and was not happy about doing that. This was rated 15 on it is UK release, but short of a small bit of bloodshed and death, its mainly the suggestion of violence that serves to give it that rating. The acting is superb, and with great cinematography and a gritty score this is a good film. Do not expect a happy ending because of course this is a film based on fact, and the killer was never identified. What you can expect is a very long but well-polished, tense, and thrilling character driven film which remains engaging enough to entertain and covers some of the key facts unearthed throughout the investigation.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
"Probably ""too realistic"" for its own good","The characters are all ""too mundane"". Even the obsessed character (often overacted) is quite bland (not Jake Gyllenhaal's fault), let alone the incredible amount of police officers and detectives that we came across.All the performers look bored except for Mark Ruffalo (clearly the heart and soul of the film). And even he gets axed from the conclusion in the third act (focused on Jake). I don't understand why Robert Downey Jr. Was cast for this. He was really bad. I didn't believe for a second he was a journalist.In the end, the movie is... sterile. Almost like a mediocre documentary that can't create a narrative, it jumps so much trough time without giving the characters screentime to reflect and suffer the consequences of the unresolved case, which forces us to focus on the minutia of the police work.

"Human evil has no face, we never know who is capable of doing this kind of things, Zodiac could not be recognized but we know that he was a human being.","Zodiac has everything that appeals to those who enjoy thrillers and immersing themselves in a deep, dangerous investigation. However, beyond its intense pacing and suspenseful scenes, Zodiac delves into a question that humanity has pondered since ancient times: to what extent can human evil go? Evil and psychology are two key themes in the film. Whoever the Zodiac killer may be, we know he is a monster, a ruthless murderer who craves attention for his crimes. This is why he takes each of his actions very seriously, carefully orchestrating them to ensure that people will talk about him for years to come. Ironically, I am writing this review exactly 55 years after the first public appearance of this character. Therefore, one could argue that, whoever he may have been, Zodiac achieved his goal: to create a legacy through his murders without ever being caught. The ""artist"" is known by his art, not by the artist himself.In most films and stories about serial killers, we come to know the killer, we are given an explanation for their motive, or we understand why and how this character reached the moral point where they kill people as if it were a hobby. It is unsettling to know that there are individuals who derive some kind of pleasure from killing others. ""Some men just want to watch the world burn,"" said Michael Caine in The Dark Knight. But if such people truly exist, there is often no apparent explanation, beyond an insatiable hunger to kill, cause chaos, and harm others. But what happens when this desire is mixed with a strange and macabre ego trip? This is where we encounter Zodiac: a man who not only enjoyed killing but also sought recognition for it. The fact that he was never caught seems straight out of fiction, but it's real. We never learned the traumas of this man-or perhaps these men. Zodiac could have been not just one person, but an identity assumed by multiple killers over the years. One could even compare it to a demented artistic movement that terrorized the United States during the 1970s. It could have been Leigh, it could have been Rick Marshall, Bob Vaughn, or... wait, did Rick Marshall actually exist?This story is both fascinating and unsettling because it opens up a difficult conversation for many. These people exist in real life. Why do they do it? How does one feel pleasure after torturing and killing someone? These questions have long been studied by psychologists, yet no answers have emerged. This film keeps me awake, not due to the suspense, but because the human mind is more macabre and disturbing than we could ever imagine. Zodiac became a fear that became ingrained in the public mind, a fear and a phenomenon without a face. Perhaps the very fact that it lacks a specific face is the most realistic representation of human evil. Have you ever experienced the disappointment of meeting someone you'd heard unsettling things about, only to find that they do not match your expectations? People's faces never truly reveal who they are inside, and that is why it is so fascinating and, at the same time, disturbing that we will never know the true face of Zodiac.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

Spectacular,"I'm not one of those people who loves true crime documentaries and obsesses over serial killers, so I had no knowledge at all of the Zodiac murderer. All of this made Zodiac one hell of an experience for me. What a story. What a mystery. It was hard not to get dragged into Jake Gyllenhaal's labyrinth of clues and fall into the mystery of the Zodiac killer.As you'd expect from David Fincher taking on a serial killer, the film is dark, moody and stylish. All of his directorial trademarks are here in all their glory, and it may be one of his best from a technical perspective (it certainly warrants a place at the table in that discussion).What I found the film did so well was transcend time effortlessly and effectively. Taking place over decades, but focusing mostly on the late 60s/early 70s, there was a mammoth task facing Fincher in weaving together the sometimes disparate and loose threads that converge to create the Zodiac mystery. Its a testament to his skill as a filmmaker that this story was executed on screen without a hitch. As well as this, he made a two hour forty film absolutely fly by, with something to extract from every scene. The narrative could easily have got out of hand and felt confused, rushed or drawn out, but Fincher nailed the balance here.The film benefited from a very intriguing and captivating set of characters who were tremendously brought to life by a main cast of Jake Gyllenhaal, Robert Downey Jr and Mark Ruffalo. Their performances were made all the more impressive by the fact that they played characters over an extended period, all of whom experienced changing attitudes and relationships with the case of the Zodiac. Jake Gyllenhaal in particular deserves a nod here for his performance, which tied the film together and was the unifying thread for the viewer throughout.Zodiac is a very technically brilliant film, and also delivers so much intrigue, suspense and mystery. Its hard to tear your eyes away and not to be absolutely grossed in this superb retelling of a tantalising manhunt.Yet another spectacular film from the brilliant David Fincher.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Police reconstruction,"'Zodiac' is David Fincher's film about a long-running police investigation into an uncaught serial killer. The film's central character is a newspaper cartoonist who (in real life, as in the movie) became obsessed with the case; but the film follows the full, convoluted investigative procedure. Fincher is certainly a skilled director, although sometimes the film appears to be presenting (in its background music and stories) a sketch-by-numbers account of recent history. More problematic is its lack of focus: most characters are only briefly in the spotlight, and the lack of both resolution (and continuing murders) eventually diffuses interest: another year, another clue, but the (instinctively realistic, and in fact accurate) lack of resolution reminds one why thrillers tend to go for implausible melodramatic conclusions. This isn't quite a detective film, a killer-thriller, or even a straightforward movie about obsession: credit should be given to Fincher for not staying within the straight-jacket of a single narrow convention, but at times, it feels more like police reconstruction than drama.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

Most Over-Rated Movie of 2007,"I was about to write my own review of Zodiac when I thought I'd check out the last few IMDb reviews. People seem to either love it or hate it. Judging by the near empty theater I saw it in yesterday I'd say the latter seems to be the dominant opinion. If you do want to see it on a big screen you better see it soon -- the movie isn't doing very well at the box office.After reading a few of the past IMDb reviews which rated Zodiac a ""10"" I have to wonder, did I see the same movie? (Note: all the quotes are from a previous IMDb review):""Masterpiece""? --- No way.""Tense""? --- Nope.""Mystery Suspense""? --- I wish.""Mind-bendingly absorbing""? --- Try mind-bendingly dull.""Creepily Disturbing""? --- Yes, because I was wasting 3 hours of my life on this.""Riveting drama""? --- About as much as paint drying.""So dense I had to watch it two times""? --- Try running full force into a brick wall, it'll at least be cheaper and take much less than 160 minutes.""Top notch production values which obviously cost high sums of money"" --- I bet the studio that made it wishes they could get their money back.""Best movie of 2007"" --- try most over-rated movie of 2007.Okay, so we have a difference of opinion here. However, what I really dislike about some of these ""10"" rated reviews is the way they defend their positions with lines like ""Zodiac is tragically under-appreciated as a commercial flop due to the majority of the audience's disdain out of a short-attention-span impatience, dissatisfaction and ignorance."" First of all, I do not under-appreciate it as a commercial flop at all. On the contrary. I very much appreciate it as a commercial flop  because this movie stunk and deserves to be a commercial flop  but I don't think that's what the reviewer was really trying to say. What he was trying to say was that because I was exceedingly bored by the movie that I have a short attention span and that I am ignorant --- and that I shouldn't trust my own dissatisfaction.I guess when you have such a superiority complex you have to explain away why this ""dense"" ""masterpiece"" is playing in a theater that's ""nearly empty"" save for (and I'm paraphrasing a previous review) a few senior citizens who you somehow were able to ascertain ""liked the film."" Maybe they were so happy about the experience because they only paid senior citizen bargain prices while you had to pay full freight.Okay, so I've had my rant because I don't like being told that I'm ignorant just because I thought this movie was atrocious.Why do I think it was atrocious?Story: Convoluted. Emotionally uninvolving.Editing: Terrible. The movie's an hour too long.Acting: Wooden. Jake Gyllenhaal is particularly flat.Cinematography: Strangely subdued with a few standout shots that are disconnected to the story. I'm not sure that the look was all that appropriate for the period. It probably would have looked better had it been shot on film rather than digitally.Production Design: Excellent at recreating the period. But when that's all that's watchable about the movie, something is definitely going wrong.Will this movie stand ""the test of time"" as ""viewer appreciation grows"" for the misunderstood ""Zodiac"" (as a previous reviewer has predicted). I think not. My prediction: the movie will not even be screening in theaters in a few weeks. Not soon enough if you ask me.",1.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Zodiac,"The still-unidentified Zodiac — a serial murderer who made Northern California his own private ant farm throughout 1968-69 — had but five confirmed kills. David Fincher's ""Zodiac"" drilled into dark pathology's of each man's process — anxiety, compulsion, uncertainty, miscommunication, territorialism — and directed Jake Gyllenhaal (Graysmith), Robert Downey Jr. (Avery) and Mark Ruffalo (Toschi) to stupendous specificities. ""Zodiac"" is not without wry humor or unexpected character details. But the onus of obsession is Fincher's foremost goal — desperation for definitive answers that obscures danger. ""Zodiac"" rides in a paranoia rumbleseat all along, but floors it over potholes during a spine-tingling climactic basement scene — evocative of how discovery and understanding come to supersede sanity, safety, justice or reason. So insistent, and successful, is Fincher at duplicating that hypervigilance that, by film's end, you may try writing a ""k"" in two, not three, strokes to see the difference — damning and admiring how Fincher's indisputable masterpiece has dragged you down that rabbit hole.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
"scary parts scary, a lot of filler","The scary parts involving the zodiac killer where very suspenseful in a Hitchcock sort of way, but there were only three or four such parts. The director should have made it a horror movie because it was intense without having the gore or disturbing images that are so common today. The rest of the movie was interesting, but after about two hours of Jake Gyllenhaal talking with various people about the zodiac it becomes a little repetitive. Also, the movie took place over several years and there were about 30 times where it jumped such as ""5 minutes later""....""40 seconds later"".....""3 years later"". It becomes quite confusing. All in all, fun, but not provocative and much too long.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Underrated,"This is another great D. Fincher film. It is a bit slow at times, but the very good acting and the directing makes this a compelling film.

"Could be a bit shorter, but no other real complaints.","Out of the countless serial killer thrillers, Zodiac is fairly unique. Both because it's based on a true story, and because one of the primary characters is a civilian. It's not too often that you see a cartoonist doggedly chasing down leads and sleuthing like a hardcore gumshoe.What we have seen before, is a story of obsession over catching a criminal, and the impact it has families and careers. That's Zodiac in a nutshell. And as the actual crime is still an open case, in a lot of ways the film lives and dies by how well it portrays those relationships. Thankfully, I found all that interesting.If I have to nitpick, I'll say that the running time could have been a bit shorter, and Jake Gyllenhal may not have been a perfect fit or his role. He grew on me as the movie went on, but I can think of five people off the top of my head who would have really nailed that character.Anyway, this is a pretty good movie. Don't expect anything like Se7en or The Silence of the Lambs, but it is thrilling and involving in its own way.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

Solid Misdirection,A fantastic film based on a true story. It runs quite a bit long but the runtime felt like it flew by as it got more intense. This movie did a great job showing how difficult it was to catch the Zodiac killer throughout the investigation. It includes some heart-pounding scenes where you think you have an idea that they have the killer and then evidence comes through to keep everyone guessing. The acting was fantastic in this one. I like Downey Jr.'s work and he worked well with Gyllenhaal. The settings of these scenes were very well done to portray the period the killings took place. It felt like you were transformed back in time and could relive some of the chilling scenes of the 60's and 70's. 4.5/5 stars.,9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Gripping,"Zodiac is meticulously researched and embodies its theme of obsession. Fincher is known for detail, but Zodiac's recreations are uniquely thorough. The movie doesn't function like a typical mystery thriller because it reaches beyond formulaic excitement, to the truth. Viewers won't receive conventional closure, but, instead, will witness procedural realities and weighty fixations collapsing on our protagonists. Gyllenhaal, Ruffalo, and Downey all bring complexities as their roles twist and turn. Zodiac isn't primarily a character study, but displays how people can evolve with a case. This gives the film an emotional bond as well as its mysterious intrigue.Meanwhile, Zodiac is Fincher's most technical film. The subtle effects assist the methodical environment without announcing themselves. The production implements exact details of the story. The music is a perfect balance of era appropriate mood elevation and intimate silence. Furthermore, the sound is wholly visceral, personal, and gut-wrenching. The editing masterfully weaves multiple plot threads and establishes the exhaustive nature of the case. Finally, the cinematography is beautifully mechanical and hauntingly cold, using fixed motion, crisp lighting, objective framing, and muted colors. In conclusion, Zodiac is a gripping experience that will possess viewers long after it's over.Writing: 9/10

It's Better If You Know The Case Before Viewing,"The true story of the Zodiac, a serial killer who terrorized San Francisco in the late 1960s and 1970s. He sends mocking and threatening letters to the press and police.This is a great film, though I would suggest reading up on the real case before seeing this. If you are not familiar with the case, you may miss some little details since the characters speak quickly and some scenes are suddenly cut short. The murder scenes are brutal and horrifying, though all occur in the first 25 minutes of this 162) minute film.I don't think I am spoiling anything since it is fairly common knowledge that the real Zodiac was never caught. So there are no shootouts or trial scenes to end the film. Actually it not really about the Zodiac, but about the effect it has on three men-Robert Graysmith (Jake Gyllenhaal) a cartoonist for the San Francisco Chronicle, Paul Avery (Robert Downey Jr.) a reporter for the same newspaper and Inspector Dave Toschi (Mark Ruffalo) the cop assigned to the last murder. The film remains fascinating because all 3 give excellent performances. Graysmith is called a ""boy scout"" by other characters and he does come across as a decent though at times naïve character. When the case goes cold, he becomes obsessed and tries to investigate on his own. Avery is a weary and cynical reporter who is personally threatened by one of the killer's letters, he soon becomes paranoid and descends into alcohol and drugs. Toschi is not the typical, tough guy trigger happy movie cop. He is a bit of an eccentric, wearing bow ties and having an unusual holster for his gun. Steve McQueen met with the real Toschi to prepare for his role in Bullitt (1968). He copied the holster Toschi wore for his character of Frank Bullitt. Toschi zeros in on one suspect Arthur Leigh Allen (John Carroll Lynch) but cannot prove anything. One of the best scenes in the film is when Toschi and two other detectives (Anthony Edwards and Elias Koteas) question Allen and we see their suspicion grow.I saw this film when it was first released, I had read Graysmith's two books on the case Zodiac and Zodiac Unmasked so I was totally prepared and engrossed. I have seen it several times on DVD. The Directors Cut DVD is also worth having. It contains some equally fascinating new documentaries that has interviews with the real police officers as well as two of the surviving Zodiac victims.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Good but not that good,"Zodiac is another long-that-doesnt-need-to-be-long movie, that portrays the investigations of an actual killer. The cast is good, the story could be interesting, but it fails to be a great movie. I cannot relate to any of the characters, there is no explanation as to why the main characters are so obsessed with Zodiac to the point of almost spiraling out and actually there is no action for the most part in this loong movie. As for the ending, it leads as to believe that they found the identity of Zodiac, which seemed to be the obvious all along, so this was a let down. And also, as far as i know, his true identity hasnt been confirmed to this day. So the audience believes they know who the actual killer is but we cant really know for sure.
On the bright side, i liked the images, i liked the idea behind the movie and i appreciate that the movie moved along the timeline of the events with no back and forths.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

This movie realizes the simple facts that torture is not as adequately put as death is. In face Death for all mankind is not extreme as long as it is done like Pizza in a Kitchen.

I congratulate your crew members Jake and friends on such a intrepid and vivid experiment in portraying facts in these movies.

Fantastic period piece and intrigue,"Fincher does good work and this may his best. Great casting, even though Gyllenhaal does well as the point of view person of the film, Downey Jr is the scene stealer with all the great lines. Ruffalo and Edwards make a great team, Marks best role to date. Brian Cox as. Melvin Belli is chews the scenery as well - a tasty role. And spooky performance by John Carrol Lynch as (one) of the Zodiac suspects.This is one of those movies where all the pieces are done excellently and blend to make what I think is a masterpiece: Direction, Art and Music direction, acting, story script and pacing.I remember the Zodiac case when I was younger, when the later letters came out I was bit freaked. I actually lived for a while in Valley Springs where I heard the prime suspect had lived and worked - and I read about the re-opening of the case there.Not sure how some people think this is not engaging or its boring, more to the point yes the real story had no resolution, hats off the Fincher for doing it real to life - the real thrust of the movie was not to solve the case, but to show the obsessions and difficulty in what was a unique case (e.g. No DNA or FAX or intra-agency efficiency, Z may have had PD inside info, or did he work alone, etc).Spooky and spell binding, and Fincher takes you along for the ride.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
"""I need to stand there, I need to look him in the eye, and I need to know that it's him.""","FILM: 10.0
David Fincher's Zodiac remains, in my opinion, his magnum opus. Having watched the film over a dozen times, it continues to captivate and astound me. What sets it apart in the true-crime genre is its unconventional approach-steadily paced, deliberately focused on the investigators, and devoid of typical jump scares associated with killer narratives.The film's writing is impeccable, showcasing meticulous attention to detail by using actual murder locations. The characters are intricately drawn, and the various techniques employed to depict Zodiac's attributes add a fascinating layer to each scene.The performances from the main cast are nothing short of exceptional. In fact, I consider the work of the four key actors, especially Mark Ruffalo, to be the best of their careers. Ruffalo's portrayal, in particular, is a personal favorite, solidifying my fandom well before his Marvel days as the Hulk. In the same vein, Robert Downey Jr. Delivers a stellar performance, solidifying his career comeback and hinting at the meteoric rise to superstardom that will accompany his role as Iron Man. Meanwhile, Jake Gyllenhaal, whose performance in Donnie Darko immediately caught my attention, is the glue holding the entire project together in his portrayal of Robert Graysmith.The film's music is wielded with precision, effectively creating an atmosphere of foreboding in some scenes and skillfully conveying the passage of time. It's a testament to how the soundtrack contributes seamlessly to the narrative.In every sense of the word, Zodiac is a masterpiece. Its enduring appeal lies not only in its exploration of the infamous Zodiac killer but also in its commitment to storytelling, character development, and the art of suspense. For me, it stands as a perfect film and Fincher's unparalleled achievement in the realm of cinema.FORMAT: Blu-rayVIDEO: 9.0

Insert zodiac killer meme here,"Personally, I was pretty excited to see Mark Ruffalo and RDJ in a movie that predates the 2012 avengers movie, particularly Mark Ruffalo who was not involved in the Incredible Hulk movie. Getting back to the Zodiac, I was initially surprised by the runtime. With a runtime of over 2 and a half hours, I was interested to see how they kept the audience's attention.In terms of the music, I always enjoy a movie where the music has lyrics that fit into the story and add to the overall theme. Starting out the opening with the song, ""Easy to be Hard"" was an interesting choice. I felt as though the first line ""how can people be so heartless"" was a strong start for this movie.

Really loved how a cartoonist from a Newspaper company goes behind a killer's case and gets obsessed with it. The change of a cartoonist to an investigator to writing and publishing a best selling book on the killer, that too of a case unsolved and open till now , is absolutely astonishing.

Good performances in good but not great crime thriller,"Jake Gyllenhaal (Donnie Darko) stars as cartoonist Robert Graysmith, a man who gets himself wrapped up, along with many others, in the horrendous happenings of a serial killer, a killer who calls himself Zodiac.Based on a true story in the late 60's and 70's, David Fincher (Fight Club) delivers a tense and intriguing plot revolving around a cartoonist, a journalist and many police offices, in which lies an interesting and sentimental ideology.Gyllenhaal's cartoonist is quiet and sophisticated, Downey's journalist is clever and aware and Ruffalo's detective is demanding and hurting, and these characters and different personalities give the plot depth and a good foundation.From the first excellent opening sequence involving the first murder I knew it was going to be an intense watch. The first half of the film is excellent in justifying the mystery and crime genre with the killer being kept well in the shadows and no one not knowing much about it.Having never actually heard about the real killer in real life, I found it interesting to see how this film went about portraying a real life murderer and was very gripping. However, as the film carries on the intensity wears away and instead focuses more upon the lives of the cartoonist, the journalist and the detective, which is fair enough, but I would have personally liked to see a more intense and gripping second half.I found the ending quite poor. I know it is based on a true story and everything but still perhaps the ending could have been shot differently to give the film that extra edge.The performances are excellent. Gyllenhaal was a bit quieter than his better roles in Brokeback Mountain and Donnie Darko but Downey and Ruffalo are on top form in their respective roles.The direction and settings are great as is the first half of the film.

Fascinating And Clever,"For me personally, David Fincher's ""Zodiac"" is one of the best crime films of all time. I think it's up there with ""Silence of the Lambs,"" ""L. A. Confidential,"" ""Chinatown,"" and ""Heat."" Not that those films are really similar at all, but what I mean is that ""Zodiac"" is one of the best of the genre.You are probably aware that the Zodiac Killer stalked the streets of San Francisco from 1969 on into the '70s. Although Fincher's film does depict the Zodiac murders in disturbing, but non-exploitative, detail, the film is more of clue-sniffer/whodunit centered around real-life S. F. Chronicle cartoonist Robert Graysmith (Jake Gylenhaal) and his obsession with the case. The other major players are crime reporter Paul Avery (Robert Downey Jr.) and detective Dave Toschi (Mark Ruffalo).The film follows the twists and turns of the case in loving detail for a period of about 25 years. The film is beautifully edited, scored, and shot. It is smart and clever, and trusts that the audience is intelligent enough to keep track of the minutiae of forensic evidence. You feel like you are right there next to the characters, solving the mystery along with them. The only partially conclusive ending is haunting.There is only one (and pretty minor) flaw in the film: a red herring that makes the film lose focus for about 15 minutes. Other than that, the film never loses tension for 2 1/2 hours. ""Zodiac"" is a must-see for true-crime buffs or anyone with the patience to enjoy an old-school dialogue and character-driven crime drama. A good film.

It doesn't even feel like any of his other films. Se7en, Fightclub are true classics. But Zodiac just doesn't work . The pacing of the movie is so off that it's nonexistent. The acting is standard. There is no drama, no tension. The only highlight is the cinematography which looks like a moving Robert Bechtle painting.

Crafty Thriller!,"Zodiac is a well-made thriller that does what it's supposed to do: thrill people. What makes this David Fincher film a bit special compared to other thrillers is that it relies upon talk and emotions of the characters rather than action or gore. In that respect, this film reminds me of the baseball film, Moneyball which relied upon talk rather than action. Some people might find this boring, but it's well-acted and the crafty direction by Fincher makes this dark thriller work.This film is based off the true story of how a cartoon drawer becomes obsessed with a series of murders by the ""zodiac"" killer in California and how he tries to solve the case despite not receiving any credible help from anyone.As with most Fincher movies, this film is well-acted. Jake Gyllenhaal really absorbed me in as he tries to solve this case. He is an underrated actor. Mark Ruffalo who happens to be a great actor gives a great performance. Robert Downey Jr plays himself but can we really complain?Overall, this is a gripping, absorbing tale about the gruesome murders that took place over a span of many years with only letters giving hints about the murders. Fincher does a great job toying with our beliefs. I noticed as soon as I set one character as a suspect, a new one would appear. I like when thrillers play with our minds.

The music, the history, the crimes, the camera movements are amazing.The actors are crazy, Fincher's perfectionism is bluffing, some may criticize its duration, but the boredom is absent. Based on a true story, which is ""shocking"", the movie took me away.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

True story - top-class cast but unfortunately with too many lengths,"Info & Background:
The rampage of a maniac who was never caught; the incredible cipher killer who terrified the whole country - America's equivalent of Jack the Ripper. He spoke publicly of 13 victims, later of two dozen more. The police proved that he had committed seven crimes - five of these victims died. How many murders the most legendary serial killer in the USA actually committed will probably never come to light. Based on the tIrue story of a serial killer who kept the San Francisco area in suspense and mocked the authorities in four administrative districts with his ciphers and letters for decades, David Fincher directed the thriller Zodiac - The Trail of the Killer after Seven and Fight Club.---Opinion:The whole thing starts with cool music and action. It gets straight to the point. But then the whole thing gets lost in the portrayal of the journalist and the police officer who take on the story. What starts out fast-paced and interesting loses its way in the 2 hours and 37 minutes. Again and again we think we have a lead, and sometimes we do, but it drags on like chewing gum and I wonder what all the positive feedback was about. Because unfortunately I got tired as it went on, plus the time jumps, yes even if it is realistic, I ask myself: do I want to watch such a laborious search?For me, it's more of a drama, with longer stretches where you watch the actual heroes wear themselves out. Which is sometimes more tiring than exciting. Jake Gyllenhaal embodies the desperation to stay on the case even after years incredibly well.The ending didn't really satisfy me. Of course, nothing can be done about the real events in this case. But after two and a half hours, I would have liked more and if it had been a series, it would have been torn apart because it had an open ending. That's how different the point of view is. ...-------------
Conclusion:
Goes like this - A movie that has a top-class cast and documents over the many years, the search for the perpetrator.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
A roller coaster of optimistic intrigue and pessimistic exhaustion.,"The greatness of Zodiac is in it's monotony. The detectives' and journalists' wide-eyes slowly begin to sag as they seem to get further away from catching the infamous killer. We descend into madness with these characters; their obsession becomes ours, leaving us as flustered and frustration as they are. And because of its length and scope, you really experience the passing of every increasingly defeating year.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
One Hell of a Thriller,"Zodiac is possibly one of the best serial killer movies ever made, and it's not even told from the perspective of the killer. David Finches delivers again, with top notch filmmaking for the ages.The movie is about a team of reporters who work with the FBI to track down the elusive and mysterious Zodiac killer in the 1960s/1970s.Robert Downey Jr. plays a really fun to watch character, with charisma and a coolness about him. Jake Gyllenhal plays the nerdy assistant-type, and he keeps the movie going along.There's nothing too great to report here, but it's one joy ride that will keep you enthralled all the way through. I highly recommend it!7 stars",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
No weak spots.,"As far I can remember, my first viewing of this film was in late 2007 (I was 16) with my dad and older sister (21)- we bought a DVD copy of this along with other couple of movies available at our favorite video store. One movie DVD per person, commanded by my father. Prisoner of Azkaban for me, Chasing Liberty for my sister, and Zodiac was my dad's choice. He is a big Fincher fan since the 90s and Zodiac is where it all started for me and my sister- we later watched other Fincher films, and to my dad's surprised, he never thought his daughters would appreciate Fincher as much as he did. History aside, I really thought of Zodiac that time as one of my favorite ""Killer-Thriller"" movies. It didn't bore me at all, but I was little frustrated at the ending because I wanted more. I wanted the characters to confirm something.Revisiting this film after 12 years at age 28, I had to say that Zodiac is more than just a movie about the several-decade long hunt for the infamous ""Zodiac"". It is actually a very effective thriller (not just ""Killer-Thriller"") because it didn't attempt to compress 5-7 years of story into one in order to keep viewers interested- yes it is dialogue-heavy but it relied heavily on the facts and used all of its 158 minutes to present us a credible story that portrays how stress, tension, frustration and fascination play upon the lives of Robert Graysmith, Paul Avery, and Dave Toschi. In other words, you'll barely breathe while watching this.Zodiac is a well-crafted movie on all fronts- David Fincher directs this film brilliantly showing the killings in a very effective and chilling fashion that even the screenplay makes sure you are fully invested in this investigation. The performances are great from everybody- Mark Ruffalo, Robert Downey Jr., Jake Gyllenhaal.The ""Bob Vaughn"" scene is my favorite- it's literal perfection, a pure insight into the high-wire act Fincher is doing (very astonishing). And unlike 12 years ago, I wasn't frustrated anymore at the ending. It is what is- it didn't (attempt to) dazzle me, but it does please.To conclude, there are no weak spots in this film. And, it still remains as one of my favorite ""Killer Thriller"" movies and a Fincher favorite. So, please go see it if you haven't yet. :)P.S. It's been 6 years since the last David Fincher movie. COME ON. I keep rewatching his old films- I'm in dire need of his new works. 2020 (World War Z 2), come sooner!",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Excellent - as a straightforward crime drama,"For those who like their complex crime dramas, then David Fincher's 'Zodiac' is hard to beat. If you're after a dazzingly stylised Fincher flick along the lines of Fight Club, you are going to be SO disappointed.Whilst Spike Lee's 'Summer Of Sam', which uses the backdrop of the real- life case of the 'Zodiac's murderous spree in 1970's San Francisco, to concentrate on various characters and is therefore a drama, Fincher goes for straightforward but extremely detailed and painstaking good old police work.The trump card is the solid casting, necessary as the 150 mins duration might have become less than riveting otherwise, with a central triangle involving excellent performances from Robert Downey Jnr, Jake Gyllenhaal and Mark Ruffalo. Downey is an interestingly flamboyant reporter and Gyllenhaal a cartoonist at a newspaper that first receives cryptic messages, from the killer, whilst Ruffalo plays the police inspector involved in the case.The disturbed letters taunt and confuse and the cartoonist thinks he sees a way of decoding them. You could say that the meat to the mostly veg of the film are the brief but very violent actual murders - nothing that shocking or different, at least these days but do give an indication that this was a brutal and disturbed sociopathic serial killer at work.You might feel cheated that even at the end, the case remains unsolved - this is no 'spoiler', it's fact and instead of leaving one unsatisfied, it almost adds to the intrigue and a eerie sense of unease.The period feel is spot-on and some of the music's good and whilst it certainly won't sit with everybody, anyone who enjoys a psychological profile, this is superb, safe in the knowledge that at least this one had not been made up and whilst Zodiac was released some 12 years after Fincher's own ground-breaking and classic 'Se7en', you can see the same mind expertly working both scenarios.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
not a standing masterpiece but remarkable,"""Zodiac"" is a fascinating movie with lots of suspects, holding you in its grip from start to finish; gets to maintain a rhythm of both anxiety and fear and it's certainly a must - see film despite not being as considerable as ""Seven"". Would say some parts of it are inconclusive but Fincher transports the audience, masterfully, in the mood of the Seventies. It's unsettling, either intellectually or emotionally, and subtly delivers tension and anxiety. Probably overlong and superbly acted, this movie - partly police film, partly monster film - keeps viewers riveted and seems very REAL.

Now to the actual movie, Zodiac is a movie, no more of an experience that takes you through the real life's of Robert Graysmith (Jake Gyllenhaal), Paul Avery (Robert Downey Jr) and Dave Tocshi (Mark Ruffalo), and there willingness to crack the code and find the killer.

Not that interesting,"The acting was good, but the movie doesn't really know what to focus on. There are several protagonists and there's a little drama, but it's not a real drama. And there's some violence and some suspense, but you can hardly call this a thriller.
I enjoyed this for the acting of Gyllenhaal, Ruffalo and Downey junior and the funny parts. And one particular scene when Gyllenhaal visits a filmmaker at his home. But overall.. it was a very long movie and I wasn't emotionally attached to it. It wasn't like I couldn't pause the movie to take a leak or grab some snacks.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

Solid,"I really liked this movie - sort of.It is a two and a half hour long story about the serial killer who named himself 'Zodiac' and a bunch of people who investigated on him. Now two and a half hours sounds longer than they felt. Although the movie isn't really fast paced, I couldn't make out any particular lengthy parts.But it's fleeting by. There are about three dozen leaps in the time setting, every other scene starts with ""x days/weeks/years later"". And with no time spend at any date, there is no time to really flesh out the characters. Of which there are a lot. Probably too many. Only one got any kind of tangible background, but it's still not enough to make him credible.Lots of characters on the other hand give lots of fine actors a chance to show their skills. The cast is brilliant. Fine, seasoned actors, most of whom you'll likely have seen before.I liked the pace of the movie, despite the ""fleetiness"" it's told without haste and very dry, none of the flashy visual gimmicks you'd come to expect from David Fincher.What really precludes a higher rating than 6/10 is the absence of either a climax or a satisfying conclusion.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Stab in the back rip off!,"The Zodiac, probably the most boring film in world history! Nearly two-and-a-half hours of Jake Gyllehal walking around wondering who the Zodiac killer is. Most of the acting is o.k, but they over act a few times. And the worst part was the screenplay. I had the the feeling that five different writers who never met wrote a few pages, e-mailed them to each other and stapled them together.It was as if they didn't think it was necessary to even edit it! I was bored throughout the entire film, and my mum and my sister felt the same way. My sister almost fell asleep and my mum fell asleep twice. Honestly just rent a documentary, even that would be better then this lame excuse for a movie.",1.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
"A director who never, or almost never, makes mistakes in choosing a script.","Fincher has 2 films about serial killers: one about a fictional one, which came out earlier and is more interesting, and the second about a real one, which has more timekeeping and does not look so dynamic.But are these disadvantages? The film covers the entire period while the investigation was underway and goes in chronological order. The first half of the film looks in one go, but then the slips begin. This is more due to the desire to show everything too close to reality, so in the remaining hour of the film, the viewer will be saved by several interesting episodes, so you don't have to worry and be sure that something worthwhile will happen until the end credits.The cast, as always, pleases with familiar faces and acting. Few people are willing to work with such a director with his approach to work, but those who do decide to play almost their best roles in their careers.An interesting fact: all 3 main roles after this film will end up in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. That's a coincidence.And one more interesting detail about the actors: in each new appearance of the Zodiac, a new actor performs it in the frame or behind the scenes, and the film itself answers the question of why this was done in the course of the plot.I was also pleased to shoot in the film. Although the film has no re-releases with a better picture, there is an improved version using AI. The static shots in it look great, but everything else is blurred.So if you have a choice, it's still better to get acquainted with the original. I don't think we'll see a re-release from Fincher himself anytime soon, as it was with the movie Seven and will be with Fight Club.And finally, a recommendation: It is better not to study the Wikipedia article on real events in advance. Let it be a mystery to you how the film ends.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

I seemed to get more out of it this time around.It is way too long at over two and a half hours. The pace can be a little uneven, but there are some masterpiece scenes in the movie, especially the cinema poster guy at the end.Ultimately the movie teaches us more about the three main people chasing the zodiac, their obsession, their failing and their trying to cope with that failure.Outstanding.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

Speechless,"I was lost in the movie, as long as it was playing, empathizing with all these characters, and having to keep reminding myself throughout that this really happened. In movies, generally, when something happens that hurts to watch, you can take the comfort of thinking that it is not real(my mom reminds when we're watching a movie together and i react to it strongly, which is often the case). The most sad part is the amount of their lives that these people would have spent in searching for him, in fear of their lives, giving up their comfortable state of existence? Just to come up empty? And after finally pinpointing him, after many years, to not be able to do anything about it? paul avery is the one real life character is grieve the most for. At any rate, this is a story of a few brave men who refused to give up in the face of ambiguity and emptiness, and still persevered anyway, always keeping their head in the job. For that, they have my utmost respect, whatever the result of that may or may not have been.

One of Fincher's best!,"Sometimes it's the best films that may slip past you upon their release and for me, Zodiac is a film that falls into that category. The content is dark and unpleasant and the surprising lack of any attention from the Academy or from any other major awards certainly didn't help this films popularity but I urge you know to seek this film out.Based on a true story of the San Francisco murders by the mysterious individual known only as the Zodiac and is directed by David Fincher (Fight Club, The Social Network). The film follows Robert Graysmith (Jake Gyllenhaal) who is a cartoonist for a newspaper but soon becomes obsessed with helping the police find the person responsible. Some of you will know that the case was never solved but how does this make for a satisfying film I hear you cry. Well that would spoil the film.Today we are so used to seeing crime films where you already have a good idea as to who the culprit is that it often results in becoming clichéd. Here we know as much as the detectives do and by that I mean not a lot. This adds to the suspense when the detectives are speaking to various suspects who may or may not be the killer.The acting, directing, lighting, sound, camera angles and editing is all fantastic and this is all evident in one of the films more disturbing scenes where we witness two murders. Everything about the way it starts to how it ends is tense. We know that there is no one around as a man from behind a tree approaches a couple enjoying a quiet afternoon at the lake and because of this we feel their fear.Supporting cast members include Mark Ruffalo and Robert Downey Jr. who are both brilliant. Each actor plays to their strengths well and are able deliver each line perfectly, which makes it such a shame that the film was not recognised by the Academy when The Curious Case of Benjamin Button was. Both are fantastic films yet it is this film that leaves a lasting impression.For those who like films that are suspenseful then you will find a lot to like here. The dark story will deter some from seeing this film but for anyone interested in the crime genre or are a fan of David Fincher's previous films, this is a film I strongly recommend.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
What the hell happened?,"Being a big fan of TV series such as Crime Mysteries, I was already aware of quite a few things about the story of Zodiac. In fact, if I am not wrong there have been several different ones over the course of the last 30 years. In this case, the police is trying to capture a suspect who is killing random people and then calling the Newspapers to admit his guilt. Even though, the police seems to get closer and closer to the person who did it, they never have enough ammunition to make anyone face justice. As time passes by, the police gets desperate, the newspapers lose interest, and only a guy who draws for a column continues to find the murderer. Did he ever get to him? Only by watching the movie will you find out. It is slow at times, and you don't really understand why they feel the need to tell that this scene or the other happened ""one day later"" or ""two days later"", but apart from this little details, Zodiac is a good movie to watch by my standards.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
"A really dull film...but if you need to kill 3 hours, then this film is for you.","""Zodiac"" starts out with the potential to be an exciting movie. After the first 15 minutes, you are left with nothing but the minutia of a curious newspaper cartoonist with the hobby of figuring out who may be the serial killer. Unfortunately, the film WALLLOWS in this minutia because it drags on for another 2 1/2 hours after anything that resembles excitement/suspense happens. Mark Ruffalo and Jake Gyllenhaal are respectable in their extremely tedious and boring roles but Robert Downey Jr. makes both of them seem amateurish by comparison. If the film were edited down by an hour and a half, it would be worth renting. Otherwise, it seems like a dull ""America's Most Wanted"" re-enactment.",4.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

The story is told so well both in the selection and the framing of its subjects. The direction is tight and uncomplicated.But I was most impressed with the acting. The whole cast was effective, but two in particular. Robert Downey Jnr has never been a particular favourite, but he is splendid as edgy journalist Paul Avery. Jake Gillenhaal gives his best turn yet as a man who might, or might not, suffer from one of the Autism spectrum disorders. He has already one iconic character to his credit in Donnie Darko, with Robert Graysmith he has surely established another. He typifies the difficulties autistic people have in maintaining relationships, even when their intelligence cannot be doubted.A tour de force effort by all concerned.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Fincher is back and taking names,"5 years since Fincher's last film. 5 years too long. He picked up projects and then dropped them. Finally he found a script that satisfied him. ZODIAC by James Vanderbilt. 2 years after I found out that he would direct ZODIAC and THE CURIOUS CASE OF BENJAMIN BUTTON back to back I walk in to see the first mentioned. It was fantastic. The cinematography on the Thompson viper camera was beautiful. The colors were great and the camera movements fluid. The acting from everyone is great. Gyllenhaal, Ruffalo, Downey Jr., Edwards, Carrol Lynch, and even Brian Cox and Philip Baker Hall were great with the screen time they had. The movie had old school Paramount and Warner bros. logos in the opening which made me smile, and the choices of music were spot on. Everybody on this movie did 110%. The detail to all the Zodiac's murders and clues was a major plus. This is definitely Fincher's most mature and well made film. Fight Club and Se7en are still preferred by me because I have seen both dozens of times and will continue to watch them. Se7en is my second favorite film ever made. the only thing i have a rough spot for is the length. it was incredibly long. I'm sure it could have been shortened a bit, but then again, I'm glad it wasn't. That is what happens when you have a director with final cut over his movie. Anyway, all Fincher fans should go see ZODIAC. All people who don't want to because of Graysmith's opinion on the case should see it too. This is truly a great film and worthy of your time.

One of the More Popular Unsolved Mysteries,"The case of the Zodiac killer, much like Jack the Ripper, is one of those very popular unsolved mysteries.

Chronicle, David Toschi (Mark Ruffalo) and William Armstrong (Anthony Edwards) from the SFPD, and others. The movie is not very suspenseful as you'd expect a movie to be about a serial killer. There's never a first person perspective from the killer, never a person in peril waiting to be saved, or a close encounter when the police just miss nabbing him. ""Zodiac"" is a two-and-a-half-hour puzzle that is slowly being solved.

"An epic masterpiece, but too long and complex for it's own good","I loved everything about this film. From the soundtrack to the cast to the classic vibe presented when the opening credits rolled. I also loved the Dirty Harry element incorporated into the film. David Fincher has done it again. Most of this film is centered on the obsessions of a cop and a cartoonist trying to identify Zodiac over a period of 2 decades. It really is a shame this came out after the Oscars, because Jake Gyllenhal as well as Mark Ruffalo deserve nominations for their portrayals. The film runs just under 3 hours and can drag when jumping from one suspect to the next, but fans of Fincher as well as those who lived through this nightmare will appreciate the depiction for what it's worth.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
For cinephiles,"""Zodiac"" is about how three people obsessed with hunting a killer ended up compromising their lives and careers. As the poster suggests, ""there's more than one way to lose your life to a killer."" The characters keep hitting dead ends as facts and evidence get blurred out by the flow of time, the interference of media and the obstructions of law procedures. It feels like a character development-centered thriller at first, but it slowly turns into a drawn-out, tediously verbose documentary the Zodiac killer investigation and the making of Robert Graysmith's book.Davi Toschi and Paul Avery fall out of scope halfway and, despite the demanding 2.5-hour running time, the film doesn't even bother to show you their aftermath. It's all abruptly resolved with some text before the credits.David Fincher shows high competence behind the camera, but we are far from anything entertaining here. I understand that you want to stick to facts with this kind of biopics, and that excessive dramatization can lead to embarrassing results. Still, this is not the kind of film I was looking for. As many mentioned, the basement scene was pretty cool though.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Effectively Creepy and Engrossing True Crime Tale,"David Fincher has taken nearly five years off between films, and he has returned a more mature and accomplished director with his fascinating ""Zodiac."" It may not reach the cult status of his ""Seven"" or ""Fight Club"" or find the box office success of ""Panic Room,"" but by many measures it may be his most carefully crafted film. More in line with the crime epics of directors like Michael Mann than with the typical serial-killer thriller, ""Zodiac"" is propelled by inventive direction, a great cast, engaging attention to detail, and a killer soundtrack of classic songs from the late 1960's and 1970's.Based on the book by Robert Graysmith (played effectively here by Jake Gyllenhaal), ""Zodiac"" is meticulous in its details (both in dialogue and Fincher's finely painted visuals) and sprawling in plot and its parade of intriguing characters. Mark Ruffalo is especially compelling playing the lead detective who becomes obsessed with the case, and Robert Downey Jr. does his best macabre comic relief job as the boozing and drugging reporter Paul Avery who was targeted for a brief time by the infamous killer. There's also a fine supporting cast featuring Brian Cox, Chloe Sevigny, and John Caroll Lynch among many others, all doing top notch work.Fincher's digital VIPER camera lends itself surprising well to the period detail and look of the 1970's. Though some of the more brightly lit shots aren't as clear and in focus as you would like, this is the first movie I can think of shot on all digital where some of the cinematography could actually be called beautiful (check out any of the skyline shots and the great overhead of the Golden Gate Bridge). Fincher crafts some truly creepy moments using simple lighting techniques featuring characters hopping into strange cars on deserted highways, traipsing through dimly lit homes, or nervously making their way down a dark creaky staircase into a fathomless basement. There's also some nice freak-out moments in the classy and sharply filmed murder scenes and when characters receive eerie phone-calls from the so-called killer or his equally sick copycats. I didn't realize how effective Fincher's technique was until I went home alone to my dark apartment and felt a sudden lump in my throat when a friend made an unexpected late night call.There are times when the film becomes bogged down with police procedural aspects, and its epic runtime is apparent, though most of the slow parts still remain engrossing. Graysmith makes it clear who he thinks the killer was, though the case was officially unsolved. When all the pieces finally fit together, the audience feels the same sickening giddiness as Graysmith and the detectives long plagued by the cryptic case that held much of San Franciso hostage knowing that the prime suspect will never be convicted on so much circumstantial evidence. In the end, Fincher leaves you with some haunting feelings, and if anything is certain, it's that Donovan's ""Hurdy Gurdy Man"" will never be listened to the same again.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Here Comes The Roly-Poly Roly-Poly Man,"An unsolved case doesn't stop director David Fincher from constructing an absorbing and clever puzzle picture around the investigation into the identity of one of northern California's most notorious serial killers, the Zodiac.I don't know who Zodiac was, and I don't think Robert Graysmith does, either, despite the latter's attempt to pin the blame on one suspect. Reading ""Zodiac"" the book was like listening to a potty uncle rant about FDR and Pearl Harbor. Though based on the book, the movie is quite different. Zodiac was known to have killed five people and injured two in 1968 and 1969. Most of the attacks are featured in the film, but despite Fincher's reputation for violent fare, his film is more interested in delivering context than bloodbaths, and the murders are depicted in a non-exploitative way.More time and energy is spent on the whirlpool of suspicion around the case, and how it comes to consume what might be called three other Zodiac victims: Graysmith (Jake Gyllenhaal), reporter Paul Avery (Robert Downey, Jr.) and investigator David Toschi (Mark Ruffalo).All three actors deliver fine performances, especially Ruffalo. His Toschi is a masterpiece of mellow intensity, as his focus narrows gradually to one suspect he refuses to rule out because of a handwriting sample. As the years go by, Toschi can't let go of Zodiac, even though he knows he should, his career suffering as a result.Downey's not nearly as subtle, but riveting all the same, his Avery a grandiloquent reporter who seems as addicted to the electricity around the case as he is to the various substances that keep him going. His scenes with Graysmith the Eagle Scout cartoonist give the film much of its emotional content, his cynicism (""What do you want out of this...This is good business for everyone but you"") contrasting starkly with Graysmith's gentle naiveté.The texture of ""Zodiac"" keeps me watching the film. It's like ""Mad Men"" meets ""CSI"" with a touch of ""Boogie Nights"" thrown in. Even when you see the film and know where the shocks are, the creepy vibe Fincher sustains is riveting. Also powerful is the soundtrack. I'll never hear Donovan's ""Hurdy Gurdy Man"" the same after how it plays over the opening scene, maybe one of the most intense openers since ""Jaws"".What doesn't keep me watching so much is the plot. Fincher does very well with what he has, to a point. But perhaps because he wants to tell the story in a factual-as-possible way, we get dealt a good deal of blind alleys and red herrings, especially with all of Zodiac's most notorious crimes out of the way less than 30 minutes in. To say ""Zodiac"" doesn't need to be 160 minutes long isn't to deny Fincher makes it interesting. It's just that a half-hour less would have given what's left a stronger focus.Still, it's good to have a film that puts as much attention on look as ""Zodiac"" does, and presents such a fine all-around cast in moments both suspenseful and funny. Anthony Edwards is still a wingman 20 years after ""Top Gun"", this time as Toschi's less emotional partner William Armstrong. Brian Cox is hilariously over-the-top as celebrity attorney Melvin Belli, whom Zodiac apparently phones at one point.""He didn't leave a number,"" Belli adds.""He's kind of crafty that way,"" Armstrong replies.I watched ""Zodiac"" the first time expecting Rob Zombie, and found something closer in spirit to Hitchcock. Pretty good Hitchcock at that. Consistently effective, often brilliant, ""Zodiac"" is a psycho killer film that does less to scare you than to make you care.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Zodiac review,"This was a good movie. I liked that it was based off a real crime. I was disappointed that they didn't arrest or didn't find who was doing the crime for sure.

Zodiac??? More like Zzzzzzodiac,"I honestly don't understand film critics at all.Films they tend to rave about generally leave me cold and a few films they have rubbished have been OK,at least to my tastes.When this film was released the critics were universal in their praise.'Brilliant','tense','gripping','superbly acted throughout'.These are just some of the phrases I remember being said about 'Zodiac'.I wonder why I found it so boring then?Firstly,it moved at a snails pace and how it can be described as gripping is beyond me.It is also way too long by at least 20 minutes.The acting?Pretty good really especially from Robert Downey Jr.The rest of the cast are alright although Chloe Sevigny looked half asleep and Anthony Edwards was fair but no better than that.He looked a bit lost at times to me.I just wanted the movie to get going and it just didn't seem to go anywhere.It is not a patch on David Fincher's other works,especially the excellent 'Seven'.This film was a major disappointment to me and I'm just glad that I didn't go to the cinema to watch it.I really don't think I would have lasted till the end credits.",5.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
"best ""serial killer"" movie I'd ever seen","I was afraid that stepping into the theatre I was up for yet another ""serial killer"" movie that uses gore as a post to lean on for audience attention. I was pleased when Gyllenhaal and Ruffalo were able to drive this movie to the very last second. Though it started with a couple of horrific murders, I later realized the necessity of those scenes to introduce the characters. The transformation of Graysmith, Gyllenhaal, was splendid and allowed myself to be glued to the screen.The language wasn't terrible, maybe a few ""f"" bombs scattered throughout, but not noticeable, and I didn't observe any sensuality.If you're into documentaries, not that this is one, or just love a well done crime movie, I would recommend this movie, and that you take me, so I can see it again.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
"Mysterious and intriguing, but misguided and drawn out at times.","Zodiac is a 2007 thriller/drama film directed by David Fincher, which brings the true story of the Zodiac Killer to the big screen, who killed between 5+ people in and around the Bay Area during the late 1960's and early 1970's. Zodiac stars Jake Gyllenhaal as Paul Graysmith, a cartoonist who becomes obsessed with solving the case, Robert Downey Jr. as Paul Avery, a journalist and Mark Ruffalo as Dave Toschi, a detective in charge of the case. Zodiac's premise and grisly portrayal of the murders are certainly where it shines, along with the terrific acting of its cast and intriguing, mysterious atmosphere which leads us guessing and wondering at every turn. Zodiac pulls us into the film as an audience and like Gyllenhaal we often at times feel obsessed with the case and demand answers. However, the film does seem to over do its welcome especially with the run time at 2hours and 37minutes, towards the second half of the film and into the third act, the lack of action scenes can make it feel tiresome, despite Gyllenhaal's and Ruffalo's astounding performances barely holding it together. Some scenes feels unnecessary and drawn out. The film does whoever tremendously capture the barbarity, atmosphere and attention-craving nature of the unidentified Zodiac Killer, although not shining enough focus on him. Zodiac also seems to miss out portrayals of one or two murders which were possibly linked to the killer, this certainly would have helped boost the action in the latter part of the film. Overall, Zodiac captures the realism and ambiguity of the murders and keeps us questioning who and why in almost every scene, the development of the case just about keeps our attention and keeps us around for the conclusion, but at an expense of action sequences and more focus on the killer himself, despite A class acting from Gyllenhaal, Downey Jr. and Ruffalo. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
"""A Fine Film In The Tradition Of Docudramas""","There really isn't much that I can add to what's already been said. This is a great movie, and the further back in time that Fincher takes us, the more dazzling it becomes--his use of colors, in particular. The sequences used to recreate the era of the early seventies was especially haunting--it comes across as surreal...as if it was extracted directly from our memories of that period, more so than photographs, or films.This film has the walk, and it has the talk that makes for a memorable epic.If I have any criticism, it is that David Fincher's characteristic impressionism--his mind blowing spontanaeity--is sorely lacking in the production. On the other hand, did we want a funky story, or did we want the facts? Fincher is into the realism of this, and it shows in each, meticulously crafted frame of this gruesome, spellbinding saga.A formidable piece.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
"Suspenseful thriller is based on true, unsolved case...excellent performances...","ZODIAC starts off with a bang, and then gets so bogged down in intense detective work that the thriller aspect is diluted by the time the first hour is over. Furthermore, since the case was never really solved, there's no real payoff at the end--just more speculation.Despite this, it manages to hold the attention for well over two hours with a tale that zig-zags back and forth between a newspaper (The San Francisco Chronicle), its crime reporter (ROBERT DOWNEY, JR.) and cartoonist (JAKE GYLLENHAAL), and the police force with MARK RUFFALO as the lead detective on the case and his partner (ANTHONY EDWARDS) both committed to finding the Zodiac killer.The clever murderer keeps the police at bay over a period of years and still they try to uncover each clue and spend a great deal of time working on the unsolved murders that eventually claim some thirteen lives. The first murders are staged brilliantly by director David Fincher, and the film becomes a gripping search for the sadistic killer. But after the murder of a taxicab driver, the film veers into detective work with a penchant for detail that soon becomes bogged down in too much exposition.JAKE GYLLENHAAL is excellent as the boyishly enthusiastic cartoonist who soon becomes obsessed by the case. He's the one who eventually wrote two books on the subject. His scariest moment comes toward the end of the film when he's invited to the home of an acquaintance of the killer hoping to glean some important information. His fear and horror that the man might be the killer himself almost makes up for the fact that the story has no real solution. It's a brilliantly staged scene with his panic attack never overplayed.The other performances are uniformly good, but it's Gyllenhaal who does the most convincing job in the central role. Sad to see DERMOT MULRONEY wasted in the small role of a police captain.Summing up: Suspenseful and well directed, but loses some momentum when it shifts from the horrific murders to the relentless detective work.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Historical accuracy and standout performances,"I absolutely loved this movie. I have followed this case with some interest for years and the attention to detail and accuracy was magnificent. Standout performances by Jake Gyllenhaal, Anthony Edwards (although I have trouble separating him from Dr. Green) and Robert Downey Jr. should be noted, as well as by Mark Ruffalo (an actor with whom I was not familiar). I appreciated the fact that not once does the movie descend into melodrama. Some of the early scenes are graphic and grisly, however, anything less would be to soft-pedal the horror. Although the major events occurred in the 1968-1972 time frame, work continues on this case, to this day. Recently, a partial DNA profile was obtained from one of the envelopes the killer sent. Running 2 hours and 40 minutes, the ""updates"" are relegated to text in the trailer. Interesting, almost everyone in the theater stayed to read every word.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Overlong But Still Involving Story of the Pursuit of the Elusive Zodiac Killer,"Even though I was a child, I distinctly recall the news coverage of the Zodiac killer manhunt nearly forty years ago, which served as the inspiration for Clint Eastwood's epochal film, 1971's Dirty Harry. David Fincher's meticulous 2007 film, however, is not a standard action shoot-'em-up. In tone and pacing, it seems to have been inspired by Alan J. Pakula's All the President's Men (1976). Both movies take on the guise of a suspenseful, character-rich detective story that highlights the obsession that takes over the police and the press in uncovering high-profile crimes. Unlike Pakula, however, Fincher does not propel James Vanderbilt's time-spanning script (based on Robert Graysmith's 1986 book, Zodiac) as forcefully and lets the story go on far too long to be consistently compelling, especially as he is forced by facts to leave the resolution open-ended.The story traces three main protagonists over several years - San Francisco police detective Dave Toschi and two of the staff at the San Francisco Chronicle, veteran crime beat reporter Paul Avery and young cartoonist-turned-writer Graysmith. It is ironically Graysmith who is the most tenacious in finding the murderer as the encrypted letters sent to the newspaper offices feed into his natural interest in puzzles. As one would expect from the maker of Se7en and Fight Club, Fincher does not shy away from the details of the graphic killings, but the movie is far more about the frustrating pursuit by the three men separately and together. The cat-and-mouse tension works best albeit most predictably when Toschi and his fellow law enforcement officers are involved. The journalistic pursuit is comparatively less interesting because Avery's self-destructive tendencies and Graysmith's mounting preoccupation do not measure up dramatically to the palpable idea of the killer being caught and punished by the law.Typical of this genre, the performances for the most part are workmanlike. Playing a character that inspired not only Eastwood but Steve Mc Queen's Bullitt, Mark Ruffalo lends his familiar ramshackle persona to the sardonic character of Toschi - more like Columbo than Callahan. As the alcoholic, drug-addled Avery, Robert Downey Jr. shows an obvious affinity to his character, and he makes the most of it, even if it all feels a little too familiar. Jake Gyllenhaal grabs the most screen time and provides an effective portrait of Graysmith as he evolves from naïve and impressionable to haunted and indiscriminately desperate. Smaller roles are filled by Anthony Edwards as Toschi's upstanding partner, Chloë Sevigny as Graysmith's increasingly alienated wife, Brian Cox in a ham-fisted turn as attorney Melvin Belli, and best of all, John Carroll Lynch in a subtle performance as prime suspect Arthur Leigh Allen with only a hint of malevolence.The marathon 156-minute running time helps create an almost mini-series feel to the whole venture, but Fincher's dark, supple film-making style compensates to a great degree. The period detail is evocative without resorting to kitsch or heavy nostalgia, for example, the primitive state of telecommunications is conveyed perfectly in a scene where the various city police departments try to coordinate the sharing of evidence. I happened upon the filming at the San Francisco Chronicle building on the way to work last year since I live just a few blocks away and was able to witness first-hand the meticulous attention to historical detail in the vehicles and the characters' wardrobe. The 2007 DVD is bereft of extras apparently in preparation for a two-disc Special Edition DVD set that will include the commentary tracks and featurettes one would have expected here.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

Fincher misses the mark,"6000 votes and 8.0 score!!! I can't believe that close to 6000 viewers were so entranced by this new Fincher's 2h50min opus. Or, maybe someone's been cooking the books here?

But here, he completely missed it. The script is beyond criticism. Suffice it to say that it's less than fascinating to watch Jake Gyllenhal's retarded character being obsessed with chasing the Zodiac mystery killings in SF, or Downey Jr. doing his trademark over-the edge persona just for the sake of it. And intended lack of traditional denouement is supposed to mean something, or isn't? The camera-work is top-notch, though.

Zodiac - the Directors Cut review,"David Fincher has made a good career for himself making thrillers, Se7en and Fight Club both excellent films. Zodiac is another fine addition to Fincher's filmography.Zodiac tells the story of the infamous Zodiac killer who terrorised the San Francisco area in the late 60s and early 70s. He played mind tricks with the media and the police, sending letters to newspapers, including the San Francisco Chronicle. The focus of the film is on Robert Graysmith (Jake Gyllenhaal), a political cartoonist for the Chronicle and a single parent. He is good at puzzles and takes an interest in the Zodiac case. Other major characters are Paul Avery (Robert Downey Jr.), the crime reporter for the newspaper and San Francisco police detectives Dave Toschi (Mark Ruffalo) and Bill Armstrong (Anthony Edwards) who were all investigating the case. The media and the police have to work together in the case, especially because the killer makes violence threats. After more murders the police do find a prime suspect and the media get involved in the investigation, but are unable to press charges because some of the evidence doesn't fit.Years later, Robert Graysmith is still interested in the Zodiac case, even though he is married and has more children. He ends up investigating the case himself, started to write a book. He ends up being obsessed, his wife Melanie (Chloë Sevigny) becomes worried for the family's safety.Zodiac has an excellent cast, Robert Downey Jr. had done really well recently with Iron Man and Tropic Thunder. Mark Ruffalo was a good as the determined police officer. There are even good supporting actors such as Brian Cox, an amazing actor. Jake Gyllenhaal seemed a little too young for his role, but he is very talented actor and I ended up believing in his performance.Fincher is a talented director, know exactly when to add to the tension and has a very stylist type of directing. The beginning is shot in the style of a 60s film and the rest, in a modern thriller. It has a similar feel to All the President's Men. A smart move by Fincher is never showing the killer's face.James Vanderbilt also writes a good script for the film, looking at the police investigation, the media and the way the 60s and 70s were. I am looking for to see his work with Spiderman 4.Zodiac was a excellent thriller and it was a shame that it was nominated for Oscars such at Best Picture, Best Director and Best Actor, even if it couldn't win.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Who's the Hurdy Gurdy Man?,"Zodiac (2007) ****Zodiac is a great procedural film that focuses not so much on the crimes of the infamous killer, but the meticulous and frustrating search for him.This is, I think, Fincher's best film. He's is back in the serial killer genre, and he one up's his other near masterpiece Seven. This is a long movie, clocking in at almost 3 hours, but it's never boring. Fincher doesn't overplay the violence, but he doesn't underplay it as well - the murders are brutal, made all the more so by the fact that Fincher manages to make them seem incredibly authentic. Essentially all of the violence is out of the way in the first hour, and then it turns head on into the frustrating process of trying to catch a killer who it turned out to be impossible to catch.. Gyllenhaal is listed as the main character, and he for the most part is, but the films narrative jumps around between Graysmith and the police, headed up by Mark Ruffalo in a career best performance as Dave Toschi. Robert Downy Jr and Anthony Edwards also give some great performances.Even though the big ""scares"" are out of the way early, Fincher finds ways to add tension to the small moments, which are very nice. Even though Gyllenhaal doesn't quite have the right look in my opinion, he does give a good performance that despite doubts was believable enough.The films huge strength is in its great story telling, and very solid direction from Fincher. He doesn't resort to the camera tricks of his past films, but he works some great cinematography in a more subtle and far more effective way. Not to mention a great soundtrack used the perfection.Zodiac is one of the best American films so far this year, and even though it's not making a big box office splash, looks for this one to garner a lasting reputation.4/4",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Great movie but too loud,"The actors and script are good but the background noise and music overpower the actors. It's pretty much in every scene. Cars, motorcycles, phones ringing, typewriters, music, etc., all drown out the dialogue. Traffic sounds like a tractor pull. I had to put on captions to be able to tell what was being said. I found myself reading more than watching, which kept me from immersing myself in the film. In the scenes that you could hear the dialogue without background noise, it sounds like they are talking thru a megaphone in a well. I probably would've given this a 9 or even a 10 but the excessive, overpowering noise detracts from the movie.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
An intricate mystery from the mind of David Fincher!...,"Let's just go ahead and say it...Zodiac (2007) is the most intricate movie ever to appear on the silver screen! It certainly isn't the most thrilling or exciting movie ever made, but it has to be considered one of the most elaborate and detailed films ever to be created.In terms of re-watch-ability, on a scale of one to ten, Zodiac gets about a two-hundred-fifty! I've watched this movie in full about eight times and I watched portions of it at least another dozen times (the movie is replayed on TMC ad-nausea...and for some reason, I always flip it on...it's addicting!). And can you believe this...even for scenes that I've watched at least 20 times, I STILL sometimes pick up something I missed or didn't consider previously. You could seriously study this movie and come up with a different view-point every time (not about the killer, but rather the characters portrayed in the film).I gave this movie a 10 out of 10, although I admit it will turn off quite a few people. It is slow (purposely, as the Zodiac is a very detailed case). For the first viewing, you really need to be ""into it"". If your attitude is ""I'm just going to turn my mind off and watch a Mystery for 2 hours"", this probably wouldn't be the movie to throw in the DVD player. But if you're truly in the mood to get immersed in a detailed movie, this would at the top of my list of recommendations.Just to give an off-the-wall example of how detailed it is, I'll tell you the story of what I noticed last night for the first time (again, on about my 20th viewing). The main character, Jake Gyllenhaal as Robert Graysmith, eats or munches on something (usually carrots, as they try to portray him a nerd) on a few separate occasions early in the movie when he is first hearing about Zodiac (btw, the eating has nothing to do with anything in the plot). As he becomes more obsessed in the Zodiac story, you don't see him eat anymore. Then very late in the movie, when Robert's life is completely and utterly immersed in Zodiac and Zodiac only, his now-separated wife quickly mentions ""When's the last time you ate?"", and you as a viewer never think of anything of it (as they continue the conversation). As a viewer, I challenge anybody to notice something like that, something that intricate, on the first viewing. Now take that above story and multiply it by about 1000 for all the different intricacies, and you will finally begin to sense the scope and detail of this movie. I am beginning to think the entire movie, every single scene, is filled with minor details like that...as it never runs out of those types of things upon re-watches.Although this is a MUCH different movie that the spectacular ""Fight Club"", Zodiac will be considered as one of David Fincher's best works ever. Great job Mr. Fincher, my many compliments!JD",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Fincher at his Directorial Best,"It is hard to tell a story well that has no climax and no cinematic conclusion or resolution. But Fincher excels at that in this movie.

"Paced, suspenseful, gripping - the first real must-see of 2007!","It is about a serial killer. And it is directed by David Fincher. Se7en 2? Absolutely not. Fincher has never repeated himself, and there is no way he will start now. Se7en was a terrifying, unflinching thriller that offered no hope or comfort; Zodiac is equally bleak, but at the same time unlike any other serial killer movie made before.For the first time, Fincher handles a true story, and a pretty dark one for that matter: with five confirmed murders and another thirty-two he claimed responsibility for, the Zodiac was the American version of Jack the Ripper. Like the English psychopath, Zodiac was never captured (the police interrogated several suspects, with no results), and the two also shared a fascination for sending letters to the authorities, making fun of people's foolish attempts to uncover their identities. It is this aspect that interests the director: the killer's relationship with law enforcement and media. There is no room for the actual murderer or his grand plan (not that he has one), like in Se7en; Zodiac is a tale of obsession, of how one man indelibly affected four people who spent most of their lives trying to solve one of the USA's greatest mysteries.The film begins on the fourth of July, 1969: a young couple making out in a car is brutally attacked by an unknown assailant. The girl dies, the boy lives and leaves San Francisco, and the killer sends a letter to the S.F. Chronicle, taking credit for the crime and inviting the reporters to identify with a cypher he has enclosed to the message. Chronicle cartoonist Robert Graysmith (Jake Gyllenhaal) immediately asserts the cypher is bogus, and is indeed proved right, but at the same time he develops an unusual interest for the Zodiac, and joins the booze-addicted Paul Avery (Robert Downey Jr., who gives the film's most affecting, painfully real performance) on a quest to solve the puzzle. As they keep seeking the truth, their paths cross with those of David Toschi (Mark Ruffalo, the other standout in a mesmerizing ensemble) and Bill Armstrong (Anthony Edwards, in his first relevant role since he left E.R.), two SFPD detectives whose only thought is to find the elusive psycho and lock him up forever.The case goes on for several years (the final scene's caption reads ""1991""), and in order to accurately depict those years Fincher didn't just use Graysmith's books Zodiac and Zodiac Unmasked as basis for the screenplay, he also reread old files and even talked to anyone who was personally involved in the events (which is why not all the murders are shown on screen: the director omitted those for which he could not find a surviving victim or witness), which explains why it took so long to complete the film (Fincher's last effort, Panic Room, was released in 2002). This attention to detail pays off, as we are offered as complete a recollection as there can be of the facts, spread over 160 minutes that never feel stretched or boring: the story hooks the viewer right from the beginning and never lets go, its content being too unsettling and important to be ignored. Unlike From Hell, which upset a lot of people for its theories regarding the Ripper's real name and motive, Fincher does not try to make the audience believe anything, but simply tells what has been verified, although it is obvious he shares the characters'feelings towards the prime suspect (Arthur Leigh Allen, played with nerve-cracking conviction by John Carroll Lynch). He does not even show off with his usual camera trickery (the only exception being a scene where the accelerated construction of the Transamerica building indicates that a year has passed), not because, as some might claim, he has ""matured"", but because he felt that was right for the kind of story he is telling. Zodiac is more similar to All The President's Men than Se7en, and like Alan J. Pakula's masterpiece it is all about time, place and character, not action or blood.At one point, Paul Avery says: ""He offed a few citizens, wrote a few notes and faded into a footnote"". Therein lies the movie's true nature: it is not interested in telling the story of a killer, partly because this particular criminal has already been used by Hollywood (Dirty Harry's Scorpio was based on the Zodiac), but that of a group of ordinary people so desperate to give a face to the name that haunted them they spent decades working on a case they knew from the start would not be solved.Fincher considers his sixth film ""the definitive serial killer film"". He has got a point: by giving no real answers or glimpses of optimism he sets Zodiac apart from traditional thrillers, which will all seem like fairy tales in comparison. The real thing is much more complex and painful, but also, in the end, far more compelling than the usual mainstream product. An astonishing achievement, and the year's first truly unmissable movie.9,5/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

Good not great.,"Not to say that there is anything wrong with it, there isn't. It's just not that exciting or gripping. For some reason I hadn't been aware of the Zodiac killer when I heard that this movie was being made, so I did a quick search to look up the main details. I guess that was the problem because once you know what happened the movie doesn't really add anything to make it suspenseful. And I guess I'm not really a fan of Fincher either. I don't like the way he uses that color enhancing effect in his movies. Must everything be greenish or brownish? I know that sounds like a lazy comment but it just gets aggravating after a while.The actors all do a fine job. The story is true so what can I say about that? The choice of two of my favorite songs from the era, ""Hurdy Gurdy Man"" and ""Bernadette"" made me a little happy, but the way the former was used was weird which I supposed was meant to be ironic. It really reads like I'm complaining but I guess I was just expecting something spectacular after reading all the reviews and it's just a good movie. As far as movies about serial killers go, I may be a bad judge because my favorite is Summer of Sam which is hardly about David Berkowitz. But then again neither is this, it's more about the investigation. So I guess in a way the movie it most closely resembles that I've seen is All the President's Men. Just darker and brownish-greenish.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
True stories are not always good on film,"Yeah so the film is about the mass murderer called the Zodiac Killer and the manhunt for him. He kills innocent people and the authorities are trying to find him of course. The film is a true story. It follows closely the real events and the characters are real as well.That's one of the main problems with it. The film is far too long and slow. There is not much excitement apart from couple of scenes. But in those scenes you already know the outcome because this is true story. That's the problem with films following true stories very closely and not embellishing the story to fit it better in a film. I wasn't keen on the cinematography neither. The film is about a dark topic but that doesn't really reflect from the film. The setting is always bright and almost happy even.When watching this film it didn't feel like I was watching a feature film, but more like a documentary. Because honestly this is how it feels. And who would be interested in watching a documentary that runs 2 hours and 45 minutes. As sometimes in the film, the characters lose faith in finding the Zodiac Killer, I myself lost faith in having interest in the movie.So the film was too long and dull, but there was some quality acting.

David Fincher yet again proves his brilliance as a filmmaker.,"It doesn't matter whether you've seen all of David Fincher's films or none of them. He is a director who manages to take traditional storytelling and twist it so much that it becomes fascinating just to watch the plot itself progress, even if every single other thing about the movie is weak or poorly done. However, with his latest very eerie work, ""Zodiac,"" that is simply not the case. He is also a director who will never do the same thing twice. That doesn't mean that he just doesn't make sequels. If you were to watch two of his films, it would be nearly impossible to make any connections between the two in terms of style. He loves to shake things up and, despite having a large cult following, is willing to risk it all to do things the way he wants to.After a great wink-wink to the way that film studio logos have changed (he uses the old logos for the studios that were used back in the '60s instead of the more elegant ones used today), the film starts out with a very intensely filmed scene in which we are introduced to the way the Zodiac killer kills as he shoots a young couple that sits in their car. After this scene, the viewer will probably make the presumption that they know exactly what they're in for: a violent thriller that has a cops-versus-killer style and involves a lot of gunfire and killing. Think again.After hitting you hard with the opening scene, Fincher then takes an almost relaxed route in introducing us to two of our main characters, Robert Graysmith (Jake Gyllenhal), a cartoonist, and Paul Avery (Robert Downey Jr.), a journalist, both of whom work for the San Francisco Chronicle, the news station gets a letter from a man who claims to be the man who killed two couples; one on July 4 (the one I described), and one on the previous Christmas. From this moment on, the rest of the film follows the lives of three men, Graysmith, Avery, and Inspector David Toschi (Mark Ruffalo) in their hunt to catch this Zodiac killer, and how it ultimately drives them all to madness.In the acting department, a terrific ensemble each adds to the film in his or her own way. However, the three main performances are in this case the three strongest. Jake Gyllenhal adds another strong performance to his résumé, which includes lead performances in ""Jarhead,"" ""Brokeback Mountain,"" ""Donnie Darko,"" and ""October Sky."" Mark Ruffalo is an actor who I have not been a big fan of in the past. Here, he brings both a sharp personality and occasionally quite funny wit to the screen as an inspector who is thrown into this whole mess near the middle of the story. But the greatest acting accomplishment of the film comes from Robert Downey Jr., who is nothing short of Oscar-worthy in his performance as a drunk and drugged journalist who owns every scene he's in (think Jack Nicholson in ""The Departed,"" but not as sadistic). His performance is not the largest in the film, but it definitely was my favorite.You'd think that a movie that was two hours and forty minutes long and doesn't feature any action or slapstick humor would have quite a hard time holding a viewer's attention. I don't know exactly how he managed it, but Fincher has such a natural ability to hold a viewer's attention regardless of what it is that's happening on screen that you are as entertained and interested by this as you would be by a ""Lord of the Rings"" film, minus all the fancy effects and silly hobitses.I wasn't alive when the Zodiac killings happened. It happened quite a long time ago (during the late '60s and early '70s). For me, it was a fascinating experience to see what was going on with California and how they were responding to this threat both in terms of its people as whole and its small fragments that tried to piece this whole thing together. For my dad, who was around at the time and aware of the situation, he loved watching a film that followed the three perspectives of three different people largely involved in a situation that he could only watch from afar.I have seen most of David Fincher's work (However, I have yet to see ""Se7en,"" which greatly upsets me). Although I think it is pointless to compare films that are so different in every possible way, I would rank this as the second best work that he has done, after the masterpiece ""Fight Club."" The reason that I found ""Fight Club"" to be a better film was that it simply had the opportunity to take more risks and do more things than ""Zodiac"" could, because this was based on events that actually happened, whereas ""Fight Club"" was a complete work of fiction.There are going to be a lot of great films that come out in 2007. However, if you truly consider yourself a moviegoer who plans on seeing the best of the best, David Fincher's exciting masterpiece ""Zodiac"" is a film that you definitely should not miss.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Better than any movie nominated for the Oscars last week,"I usually don't comment that often on this sight, but after seeing Zodiac last night I really felt I needed to. I have not seen such a mesmerizing, wonderfully written, wonderfully acted, wonderfully paced film in a long time. I was in a theater in NYC and for 3 hours not a single peep came from the audience. It was something I have never experienced before. Everything about the film was truly exceptional. The way the pieces kept falling into place and then when you thought they had it someone walked over and kicked the puzzle to bits. The scene in the basement was beyond tense and thrilling. That one scene was more unsettling and haunting than any horror movie I have seen in the past 5 years. I don't have too much more to say other than the fact that this is an all around masterpiece of a film and one that shouldn't be missed. I will admit thought that the length of the film may not be for everyone, but I assure you if you relax and give yourself over this wonderful picture you will see a movie that is far better than any of those that were awarded last week at the Oscars. Zodiac is the best picture of 2007 so far and I hope this is a sign of the year to come that outstanding Oscar caliber films like this are being released in March, hopefully we're in for a great year for film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Terrifying and great at the same time 7/10,"""Zodiac"" is a fantastic movie by who else then David Fincher? If there is a director that can make terrifying movies such as this one it's definitely Fincher. A movie that is both scary as hell and cinematic amazing. Based on a true story: Zodiac retells the story of the Zodiac killer from San Francisco back in the 60's and 70's. The movie depicts the whole investigation from the journalists and the police department, as well as showing a few murders that have happened involving the Zodiac killer. I loved the acting during the film: Jake Gyllenhaal, Robert Downey jr. and Mark Ruffalo are great actors who capture perfectly their characters and have good interactions between them. The movie is just really scary. If I was scared before from ""Sleepy Hollow"" then this movie tops it. But it was a fabulous experience.

Kbomb's Movie Review: Zodiac,"Wow, I loved this movie, what it's about is it tells the story about a the mysterious zodiac killer who killed people in California in the 60s and 70s, they called him Zodiac because he would send letters to newspaper publishing places that would contain all kinds of symbols from different types of languages. Anyway it's also based on the book by Robert Graysmith who, from the first down his work got a zodiac letter, had been destined to find look the Zodiac killer in the eyes. There are three main perspectives in the movie, Robert Graysmith, a fellow employee of his work, he worked at newspaper place ( sorry for the ""place"" thing, forgot what they're called ) who is trying to get dirt on zodiac and find out who it is too, and a cop who is obviously on the zodiac case. Let's talk about the good and bad.Good: This is a very good interpretation on what happened in that time, Jake Gyllenhaal, Mark Ruffalo, and Robert Downey Jr. were all wonderful actors, it also had a really good ""spooky"" theme to it.Bad: I really can't think of anything to complain about it 6 out of 5, YOU MUST SEE IT, buy buy buy",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
"Like astrology - some people dig it, some don't","Weird and creepy symbols that I made to prank some friends got me a nickname Zodiac for several weeks and I didn't understand why until wasn't literally poked by the movie. This was finally the time to meet the unwanted reference face-to-face, especially that the picture has such a powerful cast.""Based on a true story"" is a label that instantly tries to catch your attention, make the things livelier and creeps into the consciousness as something very possible hiding just out the window. Here we follow the trail of a killer that intrigues the police with an unusual manner, communicating his intentions to the whole nation to be in the spotlight. His criminal activity is not totally horrifying, the shivers come from the twisty delivery and a unique performance of a sickly evil mind.The first half of the movie is dragging slowly not unraveling the full potential of the characters and this is the reason that gets you down, although the story is sticky as honey for the flies. As soon as the peen hits the locked and loaded detective line, the picture shoots loudly and potently, stirring up the viewer and swallows the attention immediately. The curiosity of the characters transmits to you and the wish to know the truth poisons your blood as the venom of a cobra, leaving no choice other than give in to the process.The most engaging part of the movie was the plot; the acting didn't upset but it wasn't enticing. Sometimes the editing gave chills and pushed that real-life terror sharpening your senses to the edge of panic.Closing the case, I would say that 'Zodiac' is a quite appealing representative of a crime thriller but doesn't have that particular charm to stay with you after turning it off.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Long... very long,"This movie was definitely not what I expected to see. I did not see any trailers for this movie or read any reviews. I just went assuming it was about the Zodiac serial killer.The movie starts off well with a scene of the first murder mixed in with lightly humorous moments and dialogue. However, the movie takes a turn down an investigative lane that only people with interest in this particular case would love and the rest would just fall asleep.As for the acting, I can not say much for Jake Gyllenhaal or Robert Downey Jr. because they play roles that I feel wasn't much of a challenge -- they play themselves, especially Downey Jr. in the role of a cracked out alcoholic. But, I was impressed with Mark Ruffalo, as this is easily one of his better performances.The bottom line is: If you're looking to be entertained with a murder mystery with thrills and suspense... watch something else. This movie is something that (sorry to borrow the phrase) ""Only a mother could love."" As in the writer of the book.",4.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
The New Genius in Crime Thrillers,"Some people may complain that Zodiac is a little too long, but it really has to be as long as it is. Every detail about the ""Zodiac"" is covered and told with great acting and story telling, and while we know don't know what's happening, we get 3 different story arcs for our patience. I've never seen a movie start off following one main character - and then halfway through continuing with the other main character. It was sheer genius! And it didn't have a bad flow to it, I actually didn't even realize until watching it numerous follow up times. It's extremely gripping, compelling and haunting all without splattering you with over exaggerated (and overused) gruesome blood scenes like other films do, which really made me love it all that much more. If you liked Seven, you'll probably enjoy Zodiac. Major differences are that Zodiac isn't dark and rainy, but where Seven was smart in its delivery, Zodiac exceeds it.

"Great suspense and characters, but bloated running length","I like that this movie wasn't just a glorified, overdramatized documentary like so many ""based on a true story"" films are, didn't jump to insensible conclusions like another unfortunate set of ""based on a true story"" films do, and wasn't terribly boring like many others are. I really liked the characters and think this movie took the best route possible for the plot because the plot is already written in reality. It was more of a character study and how in the heat of a long-running unsolved case it consumes the suspects and investigators. No matter how much you know about the case the movie works because you can either recognize ""oh, I remember reading this guy wasn't a suspect"" but see why people might have thought he was, or ""hmm, who was this guy? Was this guy someone who could've actually been the killer but the police let him get away?"" and you can see everyone with a suspicious lens and understand any misconceptions the characters may have had, as well as see the failures of the police department. The characters were very well written and it was easy to empathize for them and care about them, which is crucial in a character-centric movie. The suspense was excellent.However, my biggest problem with the movie was the length. I understand this movie wanted to explore every possible avenue that had been encountered with regards to the case, but this movie severely drags on. There is such thing as movies that can be 2+ hours long and don't feel boring. The Godfather is a prime example of a movie where not a minute is wasted. Not the case for this movie. I think you could easily remove 30-40 minutes (especially from the end) and it would turn out much more focused and well-paced. The suspense and edge-of-your-seat feeling is replaced by the feeling of your legs going numb.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
I'll never buy another 3 cent stamp again!,"Anyone who gets the relevance of the above statement to one of the characters in Zodiac can continue reading. All others please go away. Just kidding, but John Carroll Lynch, who played the hulking and probable Zodiac murderer here also played Norm, the barely-above-comatose husband of police chief Marge Gunderson(Frances McDormond) in the great movie Fargo, and in Fargo he played the winning artist of the federal 3 cent stamp competition. How much better does life get than winning that, I ask you? Anyway, he graduated to playing the ominous serial killer here, but that fact was unproved technically(but proved well enough for me). Lynch is a very good character actor seen often on film and TV in widely diverse roles, even cops.Good film, a little long in story development, and tedious in the obsessive Graysmith part(J. Gyllenhaal)from the midpoint on, as to me he was the least interesting one of the 3 main characters hunting or writing about Mr. Z. The main case cop Dave Toschi(Mark Ruffalo), and ace crime reporter Paul DeVry(the very terrific Robert Downey, Jr. here)were much more interesting, if not as zealous in their very long term pursuit of the Z as was the fanatical and never-say-die Graysmith, a cartoonist for the SF Chronicle(which of course made him imminently qualified to research and write a book on the Zodiac murders....Not!) I am not making this up, folks, as we all know that truth is stranger than fiction, and especially where the Zodiac was concerned all bets were off. I live in the SF Bay Area and know how off-the-wall the SFChron can be at times, so putting a cartoonist on the case may not be too unusual for the Chron.Well acted film overall in a good story, with Gyllenhaal seeming a bit of a weenie in his Graysmith role. He was portrayed as soft and sensitive but a real bulldog with a bone when it came to finding out who Z really was, and he never quit until the job was finished, for me, but again, not technically and legally. This horrible case ruined, or nearly ruined the careers and health of all 3 of these men, and the film showed that harsh deterioration well also.Great inside view of police work, OK, police work Hollywood style, but it was interesting to see the many official gears working to solve crimes even if it wasn't that scary/exciting, except when the Z was doing his dirty work.Great old '60's SF locations too; interesting to relive how our office workplaces used to look before high tech and computers took over everything.People loving good crime stories will like this film, but others wanting more action may be a bit bored as it is a very long film with lots of suspense but little action.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

"Not his best, but still pretty good","Fincher has a typical reputation other filmmakers can only dream of. A part from Alien3 he has only made movies that are loved by critics and fans: The Game, Fight Club, Panic Room, not to mention Se7en. In this film about the hunt for the memorable killer that hit San Francisco in the seventies, Fincher again chooses an original approach, which results in an intriguing movie.Like the aforementioned Se7en Zodiac is also about the hunt for a serial killer. But unlike its predecessor it has quite a different outcome. This time the focus is on the hunters, but the pace their quest progresses in is much lower and a lot less hectic than Se7en. Robert Graysmith (Gyllenhaal) works as a cartoonist at the San Francisco Chronicle. When the news comes out that a serial killer is on the lose, he becomes intrigued. He was initially followed with suspicion by crime reporter Paul Avery (Downey Jr.) and cop David Toschi (Ruffalo), but Graysmith just could not let the Zodiac and its cryptic messages go.With its excessive length of over two and a half hours one would say you get bored at any time in this film. Strangely enough this is not the case. And while the majority consists of talking heads; Graysmith talking about the case with Avery; Toschi who talks about the matter with his colleague Bill (Edwards); Graysmith talking about the case with Toschi; it just does not all sound quite intriguing. But actually it is! The relevant dialogues are strong and certainly contributes to this, but if you're looking for a reason why Zodiac will grab you by the throat, it is the tireless dedication of Fincher. He combines wonderfully good camera work with a very thorough preparation. The script is based on the book by the real Graysmith (must-read!) And Fincher had hours of interviews with the people involved and file cabinets full of stuff figured out.Despite the many cases there is never certainty about the identity of the Zodiac Killer. The Zodiac killer claims thirty-seven people have been killed, but the official figure is 'only' seven or nine. The main suspect died of a heart attack before he was able to be indicted. A mystery that still needs a solution, but probably never will. A good choice therefore, to choose this time to focus on the psychological state of the police and other sleuths. 'Blood and gore'-lovers should not bother. That does not mean that there are no gruesome murders sit in (on the contrary), but gorged gluttons or cut prostitutes are not part of this movie.Fincher said once that he, like the writer and cartoonist Graysmith, had a downright obsession with the serial killer. Se7en is also proof of this. Go see it, you will not be disappointed.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
An intelligent and involving film,"Beginning in 1969 and continuing into the 70s, San Francisco papers were filled with stories about a mysterious serial killer who called himself the Zodiac. Taunting the police to discover his identity - letters, ciphers, puzzles, and clues filled the newspapers until the story became a daily media event. Based on two books, ""Zodiac"" and ""Zodiac Unmasked"" by Robert Graysmith, a former editorial cartoonist for the San Francisco Chronicle and on actual case files researched by the director, David Fincher's Zodiac dramatizes the search for the identity of the killer, focusing more on the lives of the reporters and police officers who investigate the case than on the killings and their victims. The case has never been solved and no arrests have ever been made, in spite of there being 2500 suspects including one very plausible possibility discussed in the film.Jake Gyllenhaal portrays Graysmith, an amateur detective who becomes interested in the case while working for the Chronicle. Though the killings stopped long ago, Graysmith continued to pursue leads long after the official investigation ceased. The world first heard about the Zodiac after two young people, Darlene Ferrin (Clara Hughes) and her friend Mike Mageau (Lee Norris) were shot in their parked car. Darlene was killed but Mike survived but was not asked to identify a suspect until many years later. Three weeks after the killing, a letter is received by the Chronicle that claims responsibility for the murder and an additional killing eight months prior.Calling himself the Zodiac, the letter includes a coded message that the killer claims will reveal his identity if decoded. The letter also says that unless the paper continues to print his letters, the killings will continue. Though his name is never revealed, the code is discovered by amateur sleuths to point to a 1932 film, The Most Dangerous Game, in which a killer enjoys hunting down and killing human victims. The Chronicle assigns their top crime reporter Paul Avery (Robert Downey Jr.) to cover the case. When cab driver Paul Stine is killed in San Francisco, two homicide detectives Inspector David Toschi (Mark Ruffalo) and his partner William Armstrong (Anthony Edwards) become involved and the focus of the film shifts to the police investigation.Fincher, like an episode of Dragnet, gives us just the facts and lets us draw our own conclusions while describing conversations, procedures, interviews, and searches of public and private records in minute detail. As the Zodiac keeps upping the ante, he holds the media hostage, threatening to attack a school bus filled with children if the paper does not cooperate in feeding his desire for publicity. Soon the Zodiac demands that Melvin Belli (Brian Cox), a popular Bay Area attorney, talk to him on television and when the program takes place, there is some reference to the killer's headaches but little comes of the conversation. Meanwhile Fincher details the growing strains that the investigation takes on the police and the reporters.Avery is taken off the case. Armstrong requests a transfer so that he can spend more time with his family, and Graysmith, who begins to investigate the case on his own, becomes so obsessed with finding the killer that his marriage to his wife Melanie (Chloe Sevigny) is put in jeopardy. Zodiac is an intelligent and involving film that holds our attention for the 158 minute running time but, perhaps because of the nature of the case, it is without key dramatic moments or even an overriding point of view, and is underplayed to the point that it doesn't fully convey the sense of fear and paranoia that gripped the Bay Area during that period. Yet Zodiac is as completely fascinating as All The President's Men in its roller coaster ride through tips, secret meetings, false leads, and hopes raised and then dashed. One only wishes that there could have been a Deep Throat to point investigators in the right direction.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

"Expertly crafted and electrified with scorching narrative complexity, Zodiac is a daring examination at the hunt for one of the most notorious serial killers","The hunt for one of America's most infamous serial killers known as the Zodiac Killer is on, and David Fincher is the man to take the director's chair to bring this true story to sparkling colors. Zodiac is not a film that engages any typical serial killer conventions, it is part-police-procedural, part-mystery; both of which are blend together to generate an electrifying examination at the story following the San Francisco police department and their attempts at hunting down the criminal in a case that was sadly remained unsolved. If you know Fincher, you should expect that he doesn't believe in playing things straightforward. He, along with writer James Vanderbilt who adapts the script from the real-life detective involved Robert Graysmith, crafts the story with frequent narrative conundrums and shocking twists to leave the audience no more or no less puzzled than the lead character and the police detectives involved with the infamous case. With the story sprawling through the 1960s and 1970s, the film follows Robert Graysmith (played by Jake Gyllenhaal), a cartoonist for the San Francisco Chronicle who comes involved with a string of murders perpetrated by an anonymous being known as the Zodiac Killer. With the San Francisco police department in pursuit, Graysmith along his fellow reporter Paul Avery (played by Robert Downey Jr.) cross paths with Detective David Toschi (played by Mark Ruffalo) and William Armstrong (played by Anthony Edwards) as they pitted in a game of cat-and- mouse as the killer ignites an increasing body count and taunts them with encrypted messages that hold secrets the criminal's identity.David Fincher has a thoughtful eye for visual detail, and this powerfully demonstrated by his capture of 1960s (and eventually the 70s) San Francisco. From the vintage automobiles, to the production design, Fincher keeps things realistic as possible. But that is just the beginning of how the director puts his filmmaking pastiche on display, his methodology on taking the true crime story from pages of Robert Graysmith's memoir and bringing it to life is the real deal. Fincher tackles the mystery crime case with wild complexity that defies against conventional storytelling. The former half focuses on the steadily progressive bloodbath woven by the killer's twisted schemes before diving into the anxiety of the lead character and the police department as they are constantly played as puppets of the criminal's cryptic plan, and Fincher never lets his opportunities to breathing sheer suspense into the picture go to waste. With a solid barrage of hair-raising contorts, the man spins the plot into an enigmatic tale that requires us to question everything and drive use to point of throbbing our heads of with bold conspiracies. At the same time, he also builds upon an absorbing character study of the lead character as his increasing obsession with unmasking the killer not only puts a strain on his family but leaves with spun into a conspiracy- thumping craze. And Jake Gyllenhaal puts on a strong performance to weave energy in his role. Robert Downey Jr. and Mark Ruffalo remain solid throughout, but perhaps nothing particularly grand in their cases. The best thing to say about the cast is most of everyone sustains throughout the picture.Zodiac is an expertly crafted mystery picture electrified with scorching narrative complexity and gripping suspense that dares to you guessing at very turn. For a best estimated target demographic, the film will most likely to please viewers who have the patience to withstand David Fincher's trickery for capturing the energy of the plot, especially with a lengthy runtime. For those who lack the patience, they certainly do not know what they are missing.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

Finchers' underrated gem,"A movie that for David Fincher's lofty standards was met with a somewhat muted critical response and also a box office haul that didn't even scrap together enough to cover a $60 million dollar plus budget, Zodiac remains the directors true underrated gem and a film that deserves a place alongside some of cinemas best detective/murder procedural tales.Zodiac is a unique film, a based on real life account of the Zodiac killings that haunted the American populace in the late 60's and early 70's with a raft of public taunting's that often were followed with grizzly and seemingly random murders, it's a film that cares little for character development or the likes yet focus's its intentions and carefully crafted gaze on the investigation itself, throwing the audience into the time and into the thick of it to create tension and intrigue unlike many other such films.Working with the late D.O.P Harris Savides, Fincher delivered what could well be his most beautiful film yet made. Shooting in a striking visual palette, Fincher crafts his camera around the San Francisco cityscape and surrounding areas to striking effect. Building's form in front of our eyes, taxi's weave through the city at night and basements become more ominous than we could've ever imagined under his watchful eye and the script by James Vanderbilt (whose sadly not gone on with the promise shown here) does a great job at condensing the drawn out saga into a cohesive whole and his work on the film seems perfectly suited to a man of Fincher's powers.Zodiac's failings to initially make a mark upon release are hard to pinpoint, although there were lots of critics that hailed its slow paced stylings and dialogue heavy scenes, there were equal amounts of naysayers that seemed to prefer their Fincher more Fight Club than the procedural that takes place here, although the films sparring violence is haunting – a stabbing scene in particular is hard to forget – and the moments where Fincher takes us into the heart of suspect interrogation showcase a tension and unease that only the best of films can do.A great cast led by Jake Gyllenhaal, Mark Ruffalo and Robert Downey Jr do great work without ever taking over Zodiac and Fincher's film takes all its power and crafts all its magic through the use of its couldn't make it up if you tried narrative and an understanding of material that no doubt came from Fincher's renowned attention to detail.A long watch and a film not made for the average popcorn muncher that floods our cinema screen in this day and age in search of their next CGI spectacle, Zodiac is a meticulously crafted and tension riddled journey through a time in American history that to this day remains an intriguing and engaging subject matter, Zodiac is the hidden jewel of Fincher's filmography and a film well worth a repeat viewing for those that may've only watched once.4 ½ animal cracker boxes out of 5",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

Whether or not he threatened to kill this woman and her mother is hearsay-- Believe the name was something like Bat dorf (& this is Real history, too!), or some such but I digress. Anyway, this is rather highly recommended for those students of true crime who would like to better familiarize yourselves with this case, and I would further recommend giving a look at some older TV serials, namely Falk's Columbo, whom the detective Toschi in this film seems to be modeled on. Let's be careful out there, dog breaths - lol (to further mash-up the police drama references, which is this from?)",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
In the search for truth and answers.,"The movie is a realistic retelling of the events involving the Zodiac killer. Crimes that as of yet still haven't been solved. The movie is told from many different viewpoints, such as the reporters that receive his letters and the police. Because of the different approaches the movie always knows to grab your attention and interest, without having to ever fall back onto some Hollywood clichés. It of course helps that the writer of the novel Robert Graysmith worked himself on this movie project for years. The story at all times is kept realistic. Some people might find it odd and distracting that the movie focuses on so many different characters and the movie doesn't really have one main character who's solving the crimes.What I loved most about the movie was that it without problems crosses 4 different decades. The movie begins in the late '60's, then the '70's and for a small part even the '80's and '90's. The atmosphere, style of movie-making is all consistent with the decade the movie is set in at the moment. The movie knows to re-create a perfect '60's and '70's look, in a very detailed and realistic way. I think this mostly explains the movie its very high budget.The movie also shows how an interest for something can turn into an obsession. It does this subtle and non-forced. I also liked it that the movie never got too personal or close with any of the characters within the movie. This type of movie could had easily been turned into a over-dramatized one, but the movie deliberately focuses purely on the one main essence of the movie; Who is the Zodiac killer? A question that of course gets never answered within the movie but the search for the answer alone is already a tense and exciting long process.The movie is filled with some big-name actors, such as Robert Downey Jr. I like how he always seems to play a caricature of himself. And eccentric, free-spirit, drug/drink addict. He's great in his role in this movie! Jake Gyllenhaal has never convinced me before of being the right man- and have the capabilities of playing a main character and carry an entire movie but with this movie he comes close of showing he can do it. Other actors that give a nice performance in this movie are Mark Ruffalo and Elias Koteas, among others, while other big name actors play some very small parts in the movie, such as Brian Cox, Adam Goldberg and Clea DuVall.It's far from David Fincher's best work, but that says more something about the qualities of Fincher than about this actual movie.8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Searching for killer,"Searching for the killer is like searching for the meaning of live – hard job with uncertain resultsMany viewers complain about the length , but I think I understand what the writer and director were trying to accomplish . You see the search for Zodiac took years. The movie tries to capture that feeling of passing time and that's one of the reason for the movie being so long. The very detailed investigation is the most interesting aspect of the movie .It's hard not compare ""Zodiac"" to ""Se7en"" . The latter is obviously superior. In ""Se7en"" you can feel the presence of killer everywhere and he both scary and mysterious. Here we know that he is somewhere out there and that he is killing people , but he isn't even half fascinating like John Doe. ""Se7en"" also was happening in one town , which felt and looked ugly , was a character of it's own and had a very claustrophobic feel about it. Here the killer seems to be working in whole country , which makes the movie less scary.We have three heroes here – Jake Gyllenhal , Robert Downey Jr. and Mark Ruffalo. The movie keeps switching from them and it's hard to connect emotionally for the viewer with one of them . It also doesn't help that Gyllenhal (who probably has the most screen time of them all) is very bland , a true boy scout indeed . Downey Jr. is better , but he gives another ""I'm a blasé jester"" performance (which works for Iron man) . The best performance here comes from the underrated Ruffalo , who gives a subtle portrayal of mild mannered man tired of the constant chase.The movie has some thrilling moments , but it's more of a drama . It's a story about people who lived in the shadow of Zodiac, who by chasing him somehow gave a meaning to their life. ""Zodiac"" doesn't end like a movie , it ends like a real life – nothing is resolved for sure. I see this as a tribute to the people who are trying hard to catch a criminal , protect the people , work in the shadows and rarely (if at all) have any reward from the faith or society. Is it worth it ? Why do it ? You have to look for the answers yourself.I give it 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Maybe the greatest American film of this century so far.,"This is honestly just a perfect movie. From a technical standpoint, it's mindblowing. The music, the way it's shot, the way that Fincher sets up every scene is breathtaking and entirely gripping and original. He sinks you into this experience and you just go along the whole way. He grabs you and makes you feel all of the sensations he wants you to feel. But one of the ways it's perfect is through all of it's imperfections. It skips years at a time, it never comes to a complete conclusion, it doesn't give it's audience a firm ending so they can go home and sleep properly at night.It's a thriller in the broadest of terms, but it moves so slowly and patiently. You slowly become obsessed and when the film is ended you are frustrated by the lack of a solid conclusion and the fact that you'll never know the solid truth, but that's the truth of life sometimes and Fincher boldly takes you to that place. David Fincher broke ground as a filmmaker with Seven, which is in my eyes the perfect American crime thriller, in the way that it plays almost everything in a standard way (until the final act, at least) but everything is done perfectly with a lot of great commentary on society. So when you come into another Fincher crime thriller (especially about another serial killer), you expect this feature that is immediately gripping and filled with blood and action the way that Seven was, but he defies expectation at every turn here.Zodiac is not this fast-paced action-drenched thriller, it's so patient and calculated. The way it requires the audience to just be involved in it and then leaves it hanging is so breathtakingly refreshing and completely sticks with you. The accuracy in the way it approaches the case and the time period (the art direction is miraculous) is marvelous if you stop and pay attention, but it's impossible to stop long enough when the plot pulls you in so well. This is a perfect movie, made even more so by all of the ways that it's not ""perfect"". As he has shown many times in films like The Curious Case of Benjamin Button and The Social Network, Fincher can make anything cinematic (even the most mundane moments, as he demonstrated in the latter) but here he scales back the tide.He could have done these murder scenes in the most cinematic ways but he plays them quiet and he could play almost any scene in a very standard cinematic way that we are used to in Hollywood, but he goes the totally opposite way. He plays them patiently and sly, keeping the audience on it's toes and constantly playing with their perception. This could have easily been a horror film with gore and a bunch of jumps, but instead he (and writer James Vanderbilt) makes it this calculated mystery and study of obsession and the true nature of crime in America.People use horror films to escape and get enjoyment out of watching people get cut apart, but Fincher doesn't let you enjoy anything here. You see these horrific sequences and they feel so real and you recognize that even though something like this will probably never happen to you, it could. Fincher has created something that will live on as one of the masterpieces of American cinema and for my money it's the best of his career to this point.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Not your average masterpiece,"So why don't many people like this movie? Why will people you talk to say how boring this movie was? Simple, the art of the two and a half hour movie has been lost to either the too long (POTC 3, LOTR) or the too short, making you want more from the movie (for my money, Munich and several others). So we have been breast fed on hour and a half movies that anything over 100 minutes bores most people unless there is a large amount of violence or explosions. But, this movie is one of the best movies of the year despite any critics of it you know.This is a film that brings Hollywood back to Hitchcock. The script is more like a play, the dialog well written and the characters deep. The leading performances are strong, the strongest and most surprising being Mark Ruffalo. This is not the average fincher film, not fight club, not seven. Instead of packing everything with style and philosophy, fincher lets the story and the characters move the movie along. And, it stays in realism, rarely straying from the source material, making it ambiguous, not pointing fingers at any single suspect. Once you have it figured out, the main suspect changes. The film treats you like the Zodiac treated the investigators, teasing you, making you think that you knows who was the killer. It is a film that makes you think, and no one is used to that. And what makes this film suspenseful, tense, even creepy, isn't something within the film, it is the truth.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
This is a must see movie for those who love crime thriller movies.,"Zodiac is a crime thriller movie directed by David Fincher, who directed Seven and Fight Club.

"Bogged down thriller misses out on atmosphere due to ""facts""","Disappointingly rote, a numbing excess to this strenuously factual crime drama, relaying mysterious events surrounding a decade-long search for California's Zodiac killer, proves opposite of the engaging, palpable thriller it aspires to. What could have been one of the more solid serial killer/police dramas to emerge in the past few years instead becomes a repetitious detective procedural, coming across like the non-fiction book it is based on, but without any of it's intended cinematic flair. Instead of seizing this moment to bring viewers back into the dangerously seductive cat-and-mouse direction that gave Se7en it's urgent heart, David Fincher opts to walk the straight and narrow here, rarely even taking much artistic license to tell the potentially engrossing story. Here moviegoers are walked through the entire epic investigation, portraying all sides involved in a mostly documented manner.Admirable in it's objective ambitions, Fincher largely misses the entire point of making a movie like this for the silver screen and instead bogs the viewer down with unnecessary minutia; information that is certainly relevant to the plot's hunt for this elusive killer, but nonetheless will become entirely formulaic, leaving many viewers apathetic way too quickly. Perhaps if the ultra-objective script had it's actors trying to dress up some of the boring details they would have kept interest longer, but impressions during this lengthy film will sadly veer from cold to dull way too quickly and rarely come back to anything else. Any nuance evoked from a decent cast is immediately swept aside in favor of another bureaucratic endeavor.Presenting the majority of developments in methodical, underwhelming snippets which belie any attempts at fluidity from the acting and directing department, the film begins to feel so detached, the irony of Zodiac becoming less involving the more information is revealed becomes prevalent. As an analysis of the legally inept cross-communications which plague law enforcement, a scope remains unfulfilled, making it difficult to justify much of the intent here. Certainly not a complete failure, Zodiac remains faithful to facts of this case to a fault, rarely touching upon the haunting period qualities the movie could have so effortlessly offered, seeing greater results.",5.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Above average serial killer movie,"This is the story of the infamous Zodiac serial killer who terrorized California in the late 60's and early 70's. Obviously, since the story is based on real occurrences you may already know how it turns out. Then again, ""Dirty Harry"" was also based on these same events (albeit loosely).Unlike ""Dirty Harry"", though, this is not a one-dimensional cops and robbers (or rather cops and serial killers) flick where the good guys match wits with a dangerous criminal on their way to a decisive outcome. This film is more about criminal elusiveness. Mark Ruffalo's character Dave Toschi is no Harry Callahan clone. He may not like being constrained by due process but we see that in the real world the bad guys aren't always so easily identified.This film is mostly about pursuit rather than confrontation. It drags a little at times in the latter stages of the 158 minute running time but that's not a major detraction. I do think that the script could have used a little tightening, though.The acting is uniformly fine all around, with Gyllenhaal & Ruffalo giving perhaps the best performances. David Fincher's direction is ideally suited to the subject matter and creates an eerie sense of foreboding throughout. Another thing worth noting is the deft use of period-specific music, most notably Donovan's ""Hurdy Gurdy Man"".Overall, the film isn't perfect but it's a definitely better than the run of the mill movies of this type.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

Not disappointed,"The movie tries to throw light on one of the biggest high profile mysteries of the 20th century - who is the serial killer Zodiac. Knowing this is an unsolved case, I debated whether it is worth watching. I watched it for the strong cast, Jake Gyllenhaal, Robert Downey Jr. And Mark Ruffalo.I can't say I am disappointed. The movie explored the case through view points of reporter Paul Avery (Robert Downey, Jr) and cartoonist Robert Graysmith (Jake Gyllenhaal). It seems more about the characters - their devotion and even obsession about solving the case, rather than solving the case. I don't think the film gets closer to ""finding out"" who was Zodiac.

Commendable Effort,"5 March 2007. This lengthy crime mystery murder movie in a way reflects a more realistic scenario that crime investigations actually take, but unfortunately the expected dramatic path is strewn with such a slow pace unlike classic ""All The President's Men"" (1976) released only two years after Watergate occurred (of which that movie was about). The acting while revealing, particularly that of Jake Gyllenhaal, his character didn't translate into a substantive understanding about himself - his portrayal was more superficial than substantive, raised more questions than answers. Robert Downey Jr. and his performance was entertaining and more interesting wasn't a far stretch nor unique as a personality than his other on-screen personas. Perhaps the most memorable role was that played by Mark Ruffallo, as a dogged detective who must face the realism of his pursuit of this case in the end. Overall, this long movie itself represents the more gritty and routine side of crime, but without the needed cinematic magic that the best movies can offer.

Gripping and fascinating without having to bombard you with special effects or cheap gimmicks.,"How pleasant it is to have a film like Zodiac be released during a time in which masses of computer generated imagery, sequels to films made years ago and out and out star power are the reasons to flock to see films. Releasing Zodiac in May, just before or perhaps right at the beginning of the summer rush for blockbuster supremacy was a very bold move and regardless of how it did, it will be one of the best films of the calendar year with possible Oscar nominations ready in waiting.Zodiac is a detective story that won't quit revolving around a non-detective who wont quit and also features a police detective who does sort of quit but then wants to help the non-detective for good measure. Zodiac's also a number of other things; it's someone's life story as they start out in a job at a newspaper, meet people, get married and have children; it's also a horror film of sorts with the murdering of teenage couples forming the basis of the shocks but it's a modern horror without the stupid teens basically sealing their fate since it's the killer who hunts them down rather than them putting themselves in venerable positions. The film is also an absolute lesson in cinematography amongst the acting, script and pacing since not only does it all look and sound good but you can look deeper into what we're seeing and hearing. An example of this is when a bloody rag is held up as evidence and the cheater exclaims that it's ""a window into his soul."" What's relevant here is that the rag is covered in black stripes making it look like a barred window you get in jails  it may be a window metaphorically but for the time being, it's a window that's cut off.We are spared any pleasantries involving Robert Graysmith (Gyllenhaal) who's a cartoonist at a San Francisco newspaper and instead get the gist of things of who he is through lighting and overall character. Gyllenhaal acts really well which is one thing but another is the fact that whenever Graysmith is on screen from the beginning, the 'introductory' phase, the light is very bright and revealing almost creating an angelic, innocent persona as opposed to everyone else's where the lighting is dark and grim; one such exempt time is when Graysmith is in the bar with the detective on the case: the lighting is bleak in the bar and yet the drink that arrives in front of Graysmith is light blue with umbrellas and a straw, keeping the theme running up to this point, at least. Of course; when Graysmith gets more involved, things change.Despite being called Zodiac and masquerading as a film revolving around San Francisco's notorious killer, the film dabs in and out of the killer's story and uses it as more of a backdrop than anything. This is nothing like Fincher's previous serial killer film Se7en in the sense it isn't two guys trying to crack a case of murder and confusion. The murder scenes are well done and the following phone calls add an eerie amount of realism, if the calls were real then all the more credit because it all works well when combined with the call to the television centre particularly standing out. Likewise, the demise of a certain character's overall life is embedded nicely into the story as we see everything from one man's point of view as we do with Graysmith's marriage and its tension.Interestingly, the final third of the film doesn't so much focus on the capturing of the killer as any other film would because this was based on real events and in the real world, it would seem that the good guys don't always win. Needless to say, Zodiac has never actually been caught but the film plays out like an aftermath of the infamous events that happened in the 1960s and 70s yet doesn't wander down familiar, cops and robbers territory like, say, Red Dragon (2002) did where loose ends are tied up and twists occur. Zodiac is gripping and involving in its own way and is a film that will surely have a better chance of withstanding the test of time than other films released these days.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

"What a cast. What a story, What a film.","When a movie casts Jake Gylenhaal alongside Robert Downey Jr and Mark Ruffalo you expect something great, and this movie delivered. What I loved about this thrilling tale of the Zodiac killer was the narrative point of view. It was astoundingly interesting to learn the tale of the Zodaic killer from the viewpoint of the media and the police, as opposed to the film following the killer. David Fincher does an incredible job directing this movie and the most prominent element of his contribution to the film, for me, was the mise en scene. Everything from the lighting to the props and costumes makes everything so believable and really compelled me to think this movie was filmed in the late 60's. Fincher will always be an incredible director and I'd largely consider this movie to be one of his finest. If you're looking for an action packed thriller, this movie isn't for you.

Engrossing mystery,"The Zodiac killer was a huge case back in the 70s, captivating and frightening the nation.Fincher gathers an all star cast, and goes all out to lay bare the full story.I can picture him sweating away whilst compiling and editing his work. Obsessing about all the details and avenues surrounding the case.This attention to detail is commendable, and it certainly shows on screen.I almost feel guilty to criticise, as missing details and poor characterisation are a common gripe for people reviewing movies. Especially those based on true events.However, the depth that Zodiac goes into is both its greatest asset and its biggest flaw. It is just too long and meandering. It kept my attention, but I could quite see how it might have others shuffling around in their seats and watching the clock.

A mystery with so many ups and downs that your head spins,"Zodiac is about the serial killings in the 1960's and 70's by a man who called himself Zodiac. Its based on Robert Greysmith's book of the same name. Robert was the official cartoonist at the San Francisco Chronicle around the time that the killings took place and later got obsessed with the case. The plot revolves around Paul Avery, the crime reporter at the newspaper and how he gets involved with the murders when Zodiac sends ciphers to prominent SF newspapers to get publicity. Robert is not taken seriously by his colleagues and though he proves his metal by solving the first cipher and coming up with real clues, he gets left behind as time goes by and Zodiac becomes more of an urban legend. Another central character is Dave Toschi who with his partner is in charge of investing into the murders from SFPD. Paul Avery and Dave Toschi come close to solving the murder but miss it by a shave because of some unforeseen circumstances. This is when Robert Greysmith takes it upon himself to solve it.Review – This movie could have been as great as Se7en or Fightclub but misses by a mile. The problems for me were the screenplay and the characters. Now I haven't read Robert's book but telling a story with a book is different. You can take up as much space as you want in a book and still make it interesting but its not the case with a movie. You only have that much time to enthrall the audience. The story itself pans over 20 odd years so to weave this in under 2 hours is a task by itself. The other weak link is Jake Gyllenhaal who plays Robert Greysmith. I believe he was chosen as his performance in Donnie Darko proved he could do both the naive and the obsessed sides pretty well and Roberts character in the film was the same. But Jake was the weakest link in the movie for me. His motivations were never made clear and his character development was patchy. He gets involved in the beginning, then is not and gets obsessed in the end. Robert Downey Jr. is great as this over-the- top-know-it-all reporter and so is Mark Ruffallo as inspector Toschi – no complaints here. The only bit that could have been done better was developing Robert Downey Jr.'s character better – one question I keep thinking about is why did he give up when he was so close solving the case?It is still a good watch as Fincher makes sure the story is tightly knit and the performances are good enough to keep you from getting up despite the fundamental problem in the story and the characters. Maybe the book will give me my answers. Anybody read it?",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Slightly Too Long,"Zodiac follows the real life killings for which it is named after. The film did a good job of condensing the true crime story into a 3 hour movie as it seeks to answer who the Zodiac actually was, with the leads all giving good performances to back it up especially Jake who portrays his character quite well. However, due to its long runtime, this is a movie that you should only watch if you are interested in the Zodiac Killings as it doesn't really go beyond the case and doesn't do much other than tell the story. If you are interested however in true crime movies, and especially if you are interested by the Zodiac, then you should watch this. If you're not, then this movie might not be for you.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
"Based on a true story, for good or for worse","After millions of thrillers and horrors based on ""true"" stories, we got Zodiac, which is indeed based on an actual serial killer.That's a huge plus for a thriller, and knowing the murders were real adds a lot to the psychological tension of the movie, and it helps keeping the curiosity high also during the long and drawing investigation.The obvious downside is there's little room for embellishments and hoopla, and that, at times, goes to the detriment of the rhythm and of the narrative tension.Zodiac is more like a movie about the investigation than about the serial killer himself, so it's not everyone's cup of tea. It's not meant to make you jump on your seat, it's meant to make you uncomfortable on a much deeper level. If you manage to sit through the whole movie, of course.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Serial Killers destroy far more lives than just those of their victims...,"Although unhealthily obsessed with real-life serial killers and true crime, I had severe doubts about the release of ""Zodiac"" back in 2007. With all due respect to the victims of the Zodiac Killer and their relatives, this murderer's modus operandi wasn't very spectacular, his victim-count was relatively low (compared to other contemporary psychos), and the case never got resolved officially. How can a 2 hours and 40 minutes film about a killer who mainly sought the attention of San Franciscan newspapers be made interesting?Well, I was slightly right but mainly wrong (as usual). ""Zodiac"" certainly is NOT a spectacular, gritty, and suspenseful thriller/horror movie. Instead, the script (and the Robert Graysmith novel on which it is based) elaborates - in the utmost greatest detail - on how the frustrating and complicated hunt for the Zodiac became an obsession that eventually ruined the professional and private lives of three intelligent men. It's not about the killer's persona, it's about the people who intend to put an end to the reign of fear this lunatic spread across half the state of California. In the (more than) capable hands of director David Fincher (""Seven"", ""Fight Club"") and a dazzlingly impressive cast list, this works effectively well, and 160 minutes didn't even seem that long.San Francisco Chronicle reporter Roger Avery (Robert Downey Jr.) and homicide detective Mike Toschi (Mark Ruffalo) are both caught up in the cat-and-mouse game that Zodiac sets up by sending letters to newspapers in which he claims responsibility for recently committed murders and announces next ones. Avery mostly looks for fame and sensationalism, whereas Toschi is determined to rid his city of the maniac. Chronicle's cartoonist Robert Graysmith mostly stood at the sideline during the killer's active period, but he's the one who fanatically keeps searching when the other two give up.There aren't many suspenseful scenes, except for brief depictions of a few actual murders and one attempted murder, but the movie illustrates how difficult police work can be made. Various jurisdictions and a lack of transparency, involvement of the media, contradicting expert opinions, evidence that isn't actual evidence, etc.... For me, personally, the best sequence to summarize the entire film is when Det. Toschi walks out of the movie theater where ""Dirty Harry"" is shown. Toschi is understandably frustrated because that film makes it seem easy to identify a killer, and raise the impression that cops are allowed to execute suspects. ""Zodiac"" is probably not for everyone, but it's undeniably a good and effectively absorbing true-crime thriller.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
