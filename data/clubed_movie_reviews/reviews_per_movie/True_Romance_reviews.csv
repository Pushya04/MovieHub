Top Notch Pulp....,"True Romance is a celebration of film.  It wallows in every possible seedy contrivance of American crime/action cinema.  It is absolutely shameless in its exploitation of excessive violence, over-acting, melodrama, lurid sex, and rampant drug use...I love it.  Quentin Tarantino, as I'm sure everyone knows, wrote the story, but it is the in execution that this film pays off. The cast, oh the cast:  The lynchpins are Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette.  They both give solid performances, which prevents the film from flying off the tracks; they serve as the pilot light.  The supporting roles are the gas.  The Walken/Hopper show down has been oft sighted as the film's best aspect, and this is, arguably, true.  Just watch this scene and then watch it again.  Sparks actually shoot out of the screen and burn people about the head and shoulders.  OK, you've got Val Kilmer as the ghost of Elvis, Brad Pitt as a disgruntled pot-smoking loser, Tom Sizemore & Chris Penn as cops, James Gandolfini (pre-Sopranos) as a reflective hitman, and you've even got Bronson Pinchot (from TV's PERFECT STRANGERS) for God's sake. Did I forget Gary Oldman? Do yourself a favor and rent every single Gary Oldman related project (they're not all good films, but...).  Why is Gary Oldman not in every film ever made? Why? I ask you why?  He has got to be the best actor working today, hands down.  As Drexel Spivey, Oldman chews the scenery, digests it, and then expels it from every orifice.  Keep in mind that he is an English actor with a normal speaking voice at home in the Royal Shakespeare Company.  His performance here is second only to his turn in LEON in blatant over-the-top insanity. Tony Scott, who along with his brother Ridley, has been known to over-direct a film or two, here chooses wisely to basically set up the camera and run.  The score by Hans Zimmer adds a bouncy xylophone driven theme to the film and finds the right balance. This a well made, balls-to-the-wall, popcorn throwing, cult classic.  In a market dominated with stereotypical characters, this movie avoids that trap by letting the stereotypes flourish with all the grotesque absurdity it can muster. 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

Enough memorable scenes and talented stars to fuel a half a dozen blockbusters.,"With at least 12 `starring actors' in character and supporting rolls, half of them legends or mega stars; this Tarantino tale defies a short review.  The different levels on which this movie works are impressive. As a love story we begin to believe that the quirky `loser' couple is unconditionally bound together.  As a pseudo `film noir' we begin to care about the fate of the central characters.  In the suspense/thriller/crime drama mode there are plenty twists and turns to push us to the edge and pull us back just in time.  The action scenes are deliciously violent and unlike most other films, this one gives us pinches of humor sprinkled in amidst the mayhem.   Even `the King' alter ego is woven in credibly enough to improve our understanding of the Clarence Worley character.The plot, albeit original, fresh and mesmerizing, seems somehow secondary to the characters and the characterizations.  Any of several rolls could have been performed over the top by what seemed to be an ensemble cast. But director Scott lets the talent go just far enough. Even the remainder of the supporting cast is wonderful; Saul Rubinek in particular does a terrific job as the puffed-up/ego-feeding movie producer.  Hollywood missed giving this movie and its cast proper recognition.With enough memorable scenes and talented stars to fuel a half a dozen blockbusters, True Romance gives us the `best bang for our buck' in years. The Walken/Hopper scene alone is worth the `price of admission' not to mention the Gandolfini/Arquette and Slater/Oldman match ups.  This can only be described as a `wonderfully wicked movie' for its tantalizing content, smart dialog and toothsome violence.Put the kiddies to bed, be prepared for rough language, adult themes and graphic violence and enjoy a `not for the faint of heart' masterpiece.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

praise to a truly great film,"""True Romance"" is one of those few movies that has it all: Action, romance, drama and brilliant acting.  Not to mention TR has an all-star cast, but many contribute their finest work in this film.  Oldman, Arquette and Slater arguably give their best performances.  Christopher Walken's scene is nothing short of pure brilliance.  I loved him in ""The Dead Zone"" and ""The Deer Hunter"" as well as his brief appearance in ""Pulp"".  I was happy with the ending, and I'm glad it ended the way it did.  We've come to not expect that type of ending anymore.  This along with numerous other reasons too long to explain here is why I truly believe ""True Romance"" is one of the greatest films ever made. Period.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
the truth about true romance,"After reading some of the other reviews on this film I felt compelled to write a review. True Romance is my favourite film of all time. True Romance was not a film that got dusted off in the midst of Tarantino fever and is not attempting to be ""Tarantino'esq"" in its direction. Actually this was the first script that he ever wrote. It was penned whilst he was working in a video and comic store in Amsterdam. He rented the apartment above- anybody who has seen this film will know the parallels with Clarence Worley. Tarantino was actually trying to get his work taken on at the time by some film companies and he requested Scott because he loved his early work. It is true that later on Tarantino kicked up a fuss because they altered the ending and he criticised Scott for making it too Hollywood. Clarence dies in the original script! Anyway Scott agreed to make both endings and let Tarantino watch them, Tarantino then conceded he preferred the new version. The film wasn't trying to be Tarantino-esq that part was just the authors input on the film which is not common when people are making films like Harry Potter as the author has no knowledge of film but it is very common when working with screenwriters! This film is the most romantic film i have ever seen, brilliant characters, amazing sound track, brilliant acting & the cast alone informs us that this is one of the best films ever made. Brad Pitt was asked to be a lead character in the film but was working on another at the time. Pitt wanted to be involved so badly that he flew in for a days shooting just to do 6 lines as room mate Floydd. ""and some cleaning products"" was ad-libbed! Just see this film.",,Anonymous,Romance
"Tarantino's most ""personal"" writing; Scott gives commendable direction to all-stars","True Romance is the work of two men, known for making movies (as TBS would say) for guys who like movies, and have one of the pick of the litter in the genre from the early to mid nineties. Quentin Tarantino sold his script to fund Reservoir Dogs, and Tony Scott (Top Gun) got picked up to direct. Some have complained that Tarantino should've directed this film, that it's so much his (which I agree with considering the story of the film was taken from his 1987 experimental film My Best Friend's Birthday, which refers to Clarence in this film going to the Sonny Chiba movies) that his own style as a director would've complimented it. It's a nice thought, though that's not what we as the audience are left with, and so with the final product there is much to admire about the style that Scott uses in the film. He films Tarantino's script (from a Roger Avary script originally) very much like he's shooting a Hollywood movie (as he knows how to with DP Jeffrey Kimball), with all the cut-aways and editing timing that is expected in a conventional crime-drama-thriller, then by hearing the snapping dialog from the script, and the cast performing them, Scott does become an important piece of making True Romance a success.The story is a throwback to the old 'lovers on the run' formula, among others- Clarence (Christian Slater in one of his finest) is an employee in a comic book store in Detroit, loves kung-fu movies and big guns and such, who gets set up unwittingly with a call girl named Alabama (Patricia Arquette). The two fall in love, and Clarence feels confident enough by a certain voice in the back of his head (provided by Val Kilmer) to go and free Alabama for good from her vile pimp and drug dealer Drexl (Gary Oldman in one of the better villain roles of the time). He does, and through a couple of accidents Clarence and Alabama wind up with millions worth in cocaine, and high-tail it to LA to sell it, as the original (mob) owners of the coke follow after, with explosive results.For fans of the actors, in particular the supporting cast, True Romance is one of the treats of treats in modern movies, on par with Pulp Fiction's roster of know-ables: Christopher Walken as a gangster (who would've thought?), Brad Pitt as a stoner roommate, Tom Sizemore and Chris Penn as cops, a few good lines for Samuel L. Jackson, an early plum for James Gandolfini, and my personal favorite of the lot, Dennis Hopper as Clarence's ex-cop father. Another thing that makes True Romance one of the (dare I say) most accessible of Tarantino's works is that a viewer who might not know this is his work on first viewing (this was me a few years ago, sad to say) will stay tuned through the whole thing if it's on TV just because of the star power; indeed, before Oldman's Detrix is introduced into the film, TR seems to flow like it'll be a romantic drama with light overtones. All I can say is by the end of this film, you will see that good taste can prevail no matter how much bloodshed gets on the screen, or how many obstacles get in the way of love (and Elvis!).",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Great film or missed opportunity? Discuss - 77%,"Question: is this a great film or one of the biggest missed opportunities in movie history? Having heard both sides of the argument in recent days, it's little wonder that it has taken me the best part of a week after viewing to reach this conclusion (if you can call it that). Given that it has possibly one of the best casts ever assembled, a typically brash and brilliant script from Quentin Tarantino and a veteran of countless action movies at the helm, this really should have been one of the best films ever made and perhaps, if Tarantino had kept his hands on it, it might have been. Instead, we have an incredibly slick and entertaining crime film that I felt needed a bit more pace and consistency to become a true classic.In arguably his best film, Christian Slater plays Clarence who is an odd-beat loser working in a run-down comic shop in Detroit with an unhealthy interest in Elvis. After meeting the beautiful call-girl Alabama (Patricia Arquette), they both fall hopelessly in love and the newly-motivated Clarence decides to free Alabama from the grip of her pimp Drexel (Gary Oldman). But stumbling across a suitcase full of cocaine, Clarence decides to take the drugs to Hollywood and fund their new lives together. But unfortunately, the Mob are hot on their heels and soon discover what our lovestruck heroes have planned...This really is classic Tarantino territory - a contemporary crime thriller with tonnes of funky dialogue, more big-name actors than the entire ""Oceans"" trilogy and oodles of retro charm. And yet, ""True Romance"" certainly doesn't feel like a Tarantino film - the pace is all wrong (it feels much slower than ""Pulp Fiction"", despite being shorter in length) and dare I say it, I found myself losing interest. But just when I was about to give up, somebody new steps into shot and delivers another faultless performance. I have rarely seen acting of such quality from so many individuals, despite the fact that most are only in for a couple of scenes at best. Personally, I found James Gandolfini's portrayal of a Mob hit-man utterly convincing and it certainly ensured he'd be typecast for the rest of his career. Hell, even Val Kilmer doesn't suck! But all the time, I found myself wondering how truly brilliant this film might have been if Tarantino had never sold it. I understand his reasons why - I'd forgive almost anything for giving us ""Pulp Fiction"" - but I feel Tony Scott didn't quite know what to do with it. Exhibit A - the ill-judged and misplaced scene on the roller-coaster.It's not that ""True Romance"" is a bad film because it isn't and I'd happily watch it again sometime. But I just feel that Scott wasn't the right director, although he has worked miracles with the cast who are all supremely good. PBs for Kilmer, Slater and Arquette while Christopher Walken and Dennis Hopper share one of the all-time great scenes like two giant beasts tearing each other to shreds. But ""True Romance"" isn't the bone-fide classic some people think it is. It's too slow and the ending is far too predictable, ruining what should have been an absolute stonker of a movie. And it should have be - all the ingredients were in place with the exception of the director. So is this a great crime film or a wasted chance? Personally, I think greatness has slipped through our fingers.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

A truly cool 90s movie,"Sometimes there are classics that one missed, even when almost everyone at the time watched them. This is one of them for me. How I didn't see this movie in the cinemas in the early 90s when I was going to the movies every week is a mystery to me, even moreso that I never saw it on VHS or TV, when it's a very famous film with some big names on both sides of the camera. Fortunately, I could rectify this mistake watching it last week in its new 4K HDR restored version projected on a big screen, and oh, boy! What a movie this one is! The 90s were the decade most obsessed with coolness since the 30s and few films lived up to be really cool then and even less now, but this early script by Tarantino and Avary (the wonderful couple) with the stylist direction of the superb Tony Scott, the brilliant soundtrack by Hans Zimmer and an unbelievable cast that throws big names without stop, not only in the leads but in every little role (including a young and powerful James Gandolfini), is one of the coolest movies of the decade and a truly deserving classic.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Superficial blood and bullet movie,"There is a scene Patricia Arquette says to Christian Slater she has a tradition to get pie after watching a movie and sit and talk about it.

Tony Scott vs Quentin Tarantino. The winner? Us!,"Cynical, seen-it-all-before smart ass that I am, I can't but help love 'True Romance'! On paper it looks like a sure fire recipe for disaster. A typically hip pop-culture saturated Quentin Tarantino script directed by schlockmeister Tony Scott, the man responsible for rancid Simpson/Bruckheimer ""blockbusters"" like 'Top Gun' and 'Days Of Thunder'. But some how it really works! The movie is especially helped by a dynamite cast, one of the most impressive in many years. Possibly only Julian Schnabel's underrated biopic 'Basquiat' can rival its mixture of star power and cult faves. Slater, Arquette, Walken, Hopper, Oldman, Kilmer, Penn, Sizemore, Jackson, Rapaport, Gandolfini, Argo, Corrigan, etc.etc. These are many of the finest actors working today. Add them to an electric story of love on the run, jam packed with amusing, highly quotable dialogue and plenty of action and laughs, and you have yourself a genuinely entertaining update of a classic 70s drive-in movie. 'True Romance' is a wild ride not to be missed!",,Anonymous,Romance
Under-rated,"I've seen Reservoir Dogs, I've seen Pulp Fiction & I've seen Jackie Brown, but for me this is Tarantino's best crime caper. Completely engrossing from start to finish, the story of the two lovers who are on the run is not entirely believable, but seriously enjoyable. You get your fill of guns, sex, style and pop-culture, and the usual array of celebrity cameos in a film that seems a whole lot more 'close'. Whereas Pulp Fiction felt like one long trailer, with every line razor-sharp and a load of hip music that made the film go so quickly, True Romance offers you the chance to savour every moment, as the film moves at a (slightly) slower pace. Enjoy the blazing finale, and just wonder how it might have turned out if Tarantino had got his hands on the camera...",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

Perfect scenario paired with terrifying cast and dialogue makes this one of best movies ever made!,"True Romance is obscure film. Film was unfortunate to come at the time in which huge blockbusters and award winning film were slowly coming to screen, there of it was forgotten. All people to who I recommended this film never heard about it, and when they saw it, they only have one word: SUPERB! Tarantino who decided to split Natural born killers and True Romance scripts (which ere basically same script ) made terrifying job at it, but real star behind film is late Tony Scott. Without a doubt, this is best film Scott has ever made, and that can be seen in whole film, from cast to score and even ending which is best thing that Scott decided to do, despite Tarantino's wishes, but even Tarantino himself was pleased at the end of it. Scott gave himself into the film and created cult masterpiece that will never be forgotten. Cast is terrifying. Cristian Slater before he become second rate actor and Patricia Arquete had believable chemistry on screen which made whole film. Supporting cast including Gary Oldman ( In his best role ever put to screen), Christopher Walken, James Gandolfini, Denis Hopper not to mention others, made beautiful ensemble cast which was not very well known at the time, but today, they are all first class actors.

"Wild, woolly action flick, cheeky but hollow...","Darkly comedic action-based movie about two young marrieds--a clerk at a comic-book store and an ex-prostitute--on the run from police and from drug-lords after killing a coke-peddling pimp and making off with his valuable stash. Written by a pre-""Pulp Fiction"" Quentin Tarantino, whose love of cinema and movie-lore is apparent right from the beginning (with an opening credits sequence that seems a direct riff on Terrence Malick's ""Badlands""). Tony Scott directed, and though he's more attracted to sleaze than movie in-jokes, he keeps the action strong and hard-hitting. Unfortunately, after a promising start, the characters become stock figures in Scott's morass, a game of bad guys vs. worse guys. As a result, there's no emotion by the end, no exhilaration, just the feeling of having been batted around.

"Fun, entertaining and stylish with good performances to boot but all these things are carrying what is merely an average story","Clarence Worley (Christian Slater) falls in love with call-girl Alabama (Patricia Arquette) and ends up getting married to her. When he hears of how brutally her pimp has treated her, Clarence has a violent showdown with him and Clarence takes from him what he believes to be Alabama's clothes (which turns out to be a suitcase full of cocaine). With the assistance of Clarence's estranged father, Clarence and Alabama flee with the cocaine with the intention of selling it to a major film producer. However stealing drugs carries major repercussions and Clarence and Alabama find themselves being pursued by both the owners of the drugs and the police.Quentin Tarantino penned the screenplay for this film and what's most surprising here is that Tarantino merely serves up a fairly average script (one which lacks his usual creative flair). The story plays out as a sort of Bonnie and Clyde style road movie and pretty much every other drug related crime film in existence so there is very little in the way of originality here. Whilst the 'average' story is a weakness, thankfully it isn't a major one as the script is still interesting enough to make sure that one's attention never wanders.One problem I did have with this film is that I felt that it wasn't quite as exciting as it could have been; the moment Christopher Walken's character showed up I expected him and his goons to terrorise Arquette and Slater more or less continuously, but aside from the one scene with Arquette and Gandolfini and the showdown at the end this is never really explored and it just meant that the film lacked that extra bit of intensity required to put it among the top tier of crime films.Despite the above, part of the reason that this film does succeed is down to many well-known faces who command attention throughout; Walken is one of the highlights in this film and although his appearance is brief he makes damn sure it's a memorable one. The scene with Walken and Hopper was menacing and chilling (the two men are laughing at each other for a few minutes which was actually quite unnerving). This scene also contains some excellent 'Tarantinoesque' dialogue which is one thing that made Pulp Fiction both bizarre and fascinating. It's a shame that we're not treated to more of that here to be honest. Arquette is also excellent here and despite her being an accomplice of sorts she still shows a sort of vulnerability that endears us towards her. The rest of the supporting cast were OK, but I have to admit that Gary Oldman's performance here was a little embarrassing and for me no white man should try to be black. Oldman was fun here, but I suspect that this is a performance that he'd rather forget.Tony Scott's direction is also very good and he certainly doesn't hold back in trying to bring some of Tarantino's vision to the big screen (the scene where Arquette and Gandolfini are fighting is shocking, brutal and realistic and is spoilt slightly towards the end of this scene by Scott allowing things to get silly and not knowing when to quit whilst he's ahead). The showdown at the end was silly, but at least it was fun.For me, True Romance is a fairly average crime story but it's elevated by some magnificent performances, impressive direction, brutal style and a sense of fun that underlies all the menace. Worth watching for sure, but I definitely felt there was room for improvement.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Romeo and Juliet for the 90s,"True Romance has everything necessary to create art on celluloid. From the writing expertise of Quentin Tarantino to Tony Scott's brilliant directing to its cast of gifted actors, the movie is all that one would hope for.Beginning in Detroit and ending in Mexico, a loner that never really made his mark on the world meets a call girl who falls as deeply in love with him as he does with her. Filled with drugs, gangsters, Hollywood and of course romance, the movie's story becomes only stronger as the movie goes on.With exceptional performances by Dennis Hopper and Christopher Walken (the scene they share is without equal), Gary Oldman and Christian Slater, the action and violence only help to develop the plot and accentuate it's intricacies.

"The movie is kind of all over the place, but it somehow works!","This film is about a guy who falls in love with a hooker and marries her. What a lovely story, taking this poor miscreant off the streets and showing her that he is willing to take care of her. Of course, you know everything is going to go without a hitch. Not really, from a crazed white pimp who thinks he is black to mob types to undercover cops this couple is going to have a really hard time getting to the honeymoon. The film has lots of violence, some sex, and inexplicably Bronson Pinchot who at the time was still most known as the lovable Balki from the television show ""Perfect Strangers"". Well here he plays a guy who gets caught by the cops with some white powder on his nose and it is not from a doughnut. The film's best sequence to me though was the Christopher Walken and Dennis Hopper one. Great scene, I love how Hopper's character basically realizes what is going to happen to him so he does his best to insult Walken's character as a parting shot. Just wish both of them were in the movie a bit more, especially Walken who disappears from the film after this scene. I could have done without the Elvis ghost scenes, but aside from that I have a rather positive image of this movie despite the fact it is not something I typically care for.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Absolutely Incredible,"Watched this for the first time last night and it's one of the greatest movies I've ever seen. You can tell it was written by Quentin Tarantino and if you didn't know otherwise you'd think it was directed by him too. Every character is brilliantly portrayed. Even supporting actors that only have minimal screen time such as Christopher Walken, Dennis Hopper and Gary Oldman give very memorable performances and have some of the best scenes in the film. Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette both give Oscar worthy performances in their lead roles. True Romance has the perfect mix of great dialogue, romance, action and strong violence. Without spoiling the ending, what I really wanted from this film was a satisfying ending and it delivered %100. Some scenes will have you laughing out loud while others while have you on the edge of your seat with tension. I don't really see the point of casting Brad Pitt in such a small and unimportant role when any actor could of filled the role but this in no way hinders the enjoyment of the film. The film also has a great soundtrack which I listened to straight after I'd finished and has a good mix of different genre's.

A fun watch from early Tarantino,"This is a film that doesn't crop up as much when discussing Tarantino's filmography. It doesn't live up to the rest of the films he's done but at the same time, True Romance is a fun experience.True Romance follows Clarence Worley, who falls in love and marries call girl Alabama Whitman. He manages to steal cocaine from her pimp and tries to sell it in Hollywood whilst the owners of the cocaine try to reclaim it.Despite not being a Tarantino directed film, True Romance very much has the same energy as one and it's mainly due to Tarantino's terrific screenplay. The dialogue is, as you would expect from a script by Quentin Tarantino, fantastic with some scenes where it really stands out and the way each actor delivers them allows those scenes to be even better. Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette are amazing here and do have great chemistry with one another despite how quick their relationship develops. I honestly couldn't recognise Gary Oldman as Drexl but he delivered an insane performance. Dennis Hopper and Christopher Walken star in one of the film's most memorable and riveting scenes where both actors shine. Brad Pitt has a short role here but provides a lot of the humour.Tony Scott, director of Top Gun, has directed the film and does add a lot of style to it. This is a film that is over the top and feels very 90s which, looking at it now, does make True Romance seem a tad outdated. I wish the story had more substance to it and the way it ended seemed quite rushed and didn't work with me completely.Despite that I think the film is still an entertaining venture. There are some really fun and memorable moments with phenomenal performances from the entire cast. It's wild, violent and overall an entertaining watch even though it has its flaws.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
The Gun Had A Trigger,"I cannot ignore the influence Quentin Tarantino's script had over the style of direction in ""True Romance"". The scary part is, if Tarantino had directed, it probably would have been even better. The sacrifice he made ended out being well worth it though. The good acting from a strong cast completed this great movie.Christian Slater's wardrobe however, steals the show.8 out of 10.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Tarantino's inferior effort.,"Quentin Tarantino is unquestionably one of the most accomplished writers ever to have graced the film industry, however this early effort fails to reflect his unparalleled craftsmanship. In fact, only a single scene throughout the entire picture feels reminiscent of his distinctive style . The aforementioned scene also happens to be the highlight of the motion picture, barely keeping afloat the unremarkable content beneath.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
You're so cool,"No pun intended - and if you either have not seen the movie or it has been a while - you not be familiar with the quote I am using here. But all credit to the movie and Quentin plus Tony Scott. QT obviously for writing the movie, that feels quite autobiographical - and I would have written that even without hearing him say it himself on the extras of the disc release I own. And much praise to Tony Scott too ... the script was tight, but what he made out of it ... and the cast he was able to assemble ... mind blowing is not doing it justice.Even smaller roles are filled with great actors ... Samuell L. Jackson having his first (short) appearance in a Quentin attached project. Gary Oldman being as evil as one can get - with a phenomenal accent. Christopher Walken, Dennis Hopper, James Gandolfini and so many more ... it is a bit like a who is who. I had forgotten how much screen time Brad Pitt had in this. I thought it was just one scene.This is a dream come true for a generation. Not just the movies that are referenced (John Woo, Sonny Chiba and so many more just visually or in the background on screens, big and small), but our ""romantic duo"". We never forget that this is a movie. We may dream to be able to do what the two main characters are able to do in their journey ... but we would never dare to do the stuff they do.The musical theme of our duo ... it is just amazing. Once you hear it you will know what is up. And then you have the dialog - the sicilian scene. Which apart from one little ad lib was written exactly like it is performed. Of course the performance takes it to a whole new level. Interesting back story on that piece of dialog in the audio commentary by QT himself. Who admit that he didn't like the ending Tony Scott was aiming at. I am glad Scott was able to box his ending through ... but if you are curious the other (original) ending is on the disc too.The disc also contains deleted/extended scenes ... one of which has a young Jack Black in it ... amazing what a great hand they had in casting ... that they were able to cut him out and still have this awesome group of people.The movie is fast paced, but never loses us. Even if Christian Slater had some issues with some banter (screaming) he had in a back and forth with Patricias character. But it makes sense - within their new relationship they have ... and within the scene and the movie. Alabama and Clarence - names one probably will not forget once seen and heard.There's so much goodness here - I probably am forgetting half of it. Like all the names of the actors - I could write so many things on every single scene. Many of which could be axed - and the movie still would make sense. There are things in this we do not need for the movie, the plot to move forward ... and yet those scenes make the movie what it is ... make it as awesome as it is. Do we need to know Rappaports struggle to become an actor? Not really - but it makes everything so much better for it ... you could boil it down and make fun of the characters ... but if you would do that, you would be making fun of a whole generation. And their dreams/fantasy ... let us dream, let us be entertained. Let art inspire us and be the escape it needs to be - yes pun intended.Edit: I did forget to mention one big cameo. Elvis - or the Mentor as he is being billed in the credits. Played by none other than Val Kilmer. And another example of the zeitgeist of the movie - of how connected it is with the people it is trying to reach. It may not have made a dent at the box office (at least not in America, UK being a completely different beast), but it has gathered quite the cult following ... and quite deservedly so. It is not for the faint hearted and best watched in the Directors cut. A movie that has many memorable scenes (the mentioned Sicilian scene being the topping) - something other movies can only dream of ...",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Good - but I'm not sure it's That Good,"Yes. It's a good film, but I don't really know that it justifies quite the accolades or the overall score that it's received here. Are there perhaps fanbois - devotees of the work of Tarantino, or Christian Slater or any of the dozen or so famous and talented contributors who are rating what they think these people can do, rather than what they actually have done - in this film - here?The basic story is fairly simple: Clarence and Alabama are thrown together - almost by chance - and they fall for each other. They also come - again more or less by chance - to find themselves in possession of a suitcase full of cocaine. A true romance grows - between the man, the woman and the illicit wealth...Some of the acting is top notch and some of the episodes in the tale are entertaining. The whole though, is a little disjointed: strong gory violence and drug taking are pretty much ubiquitous and just about the deepest message of the story is that some people get lucky while some notorious criminals and law enforcers can be absurdly incompetent and trigger-happy.Take, for instance the scene between Christopher Walken and Dennis Hopper. Perhaps these are impressive performances but the scene is both violent and exceptionally racist - and all for nothing. The plot motivation behind the racism is comparatively clear, but does that make it justified? Not for me. And does the scene advance the plot? Only really in the last couple of seconds, and only in a way that has been trailed far too obviously about five minutes earlier.We still have to wait a further fifteen minutes - about an hour into the movie - before things get going properly in a long scene between Patricia Arquette and James Gandolfini.By all means watch the film - enjoy the film - but don't forget that violence and drug-taking and racism have consequences - and not just for other people. In the real world, the central actors are more often damaged too.Overall 6.5/10",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Some good performances, but overall over-rated and boring.","I do not see why this film is so popular. It's kind of disappointing that many people believe this movie is comparable to Reservoir Dogs or Pulp Fiction. The cast is admirable, the acting is good, however the story itself had no appeal to me, at least as it was portrayed by Tony Scott. Christian Slater plays a silly, unbelievable character with a cocky smile on his face throughout the movie. However, good one-scene performances come from Gary Oldman and Dennis Hopper.4/10 - A good cast and acting can't make up for poor directing and content.",3.0,Anonymous,Romance

WOW!!!! watch this movie!!!,"This is probably the greatest movie I've ever watched and I've seen a LOT of movies!!! I am not a film reviewer, but felt compelled to review this one... also this film has a bit of an Elvis/Kungfu theme and I HATE Elvis and kungfu, which is even more of a testament to this film! Quentin Tarrentino at his finest, we all loved pulp fiction, but in my opinion this film is far greater!!!! The casting is phenomenal, the acting is superior and the music just blows me away! When the film kicks in Patricia Arquette is narrating the intro and it's like poetry! This film will move you! This film has everything! It's funny, sad, dramatic, dark, twisted and clever I gave this move 10/10, my favourite film being the Godfather it should definitely be up there in the top 100 IMDb films!

Classic Tarantino,"True Romance is one of those movies that I've heard about for so many years and heard so many great things about, but never actually got around to seeing until now. In many ways, this is a classic Tarantino film. Albeit, it's only written by him and directed, it still feels like the same old obscurely charming tone that he brings to each of his films. At its heart, True Romance is a romance with a little bit of violence, luckily the incredibly talented cast and smartly written script, it's a whole lot more than that.I'd be wrong not to mention the amazing Hans Zimmer score that finally turned me on to the film. It's so simple, yet so cheerfully poignant, if that makes sense. Coming and going when needed, and always having a presence, it's truly one of Hans Zimmer's best, which is saying a lot. I had to get that out of the way because there's plenty more to get excited about with True Romance. Let's take the cast for example, which displays some of the greatest cameos in film history. Christian Slater, Patricia Arquette, Michael Rapaport, Bronson Pinchot, and Brad Pitt make up the main cast. But the supporting cast includes Dennis Hopper, James Gandolfini, Samuel L. Jackson, Christopher Walken, Tom Sizemore, Val Kilmer, and Gary Oldman make their presence felt for sure. I don't want to overstate it, but it may be the greatest ensemble of all time.It's not just that there's a lot of great actors though, everyone gets their chance to shine. Brad Pitt has a glorified cameo-role, but yet it's one of his more memorable roles. Gary Oldman is unrecognizable as Drexel, and also has a small part, but his big scene is easy one of the best in the film. Gandolfini, in a pre-Sopranos gig, proves to charismatic yet terrifying as a henchman for a crime boss. And who can forget Walken's iconic cameo as Vincenzo Coccotti, another person after Clarence and the cocaine he stole. Scene after scene, line after line, True Romance is one of the most quotable and re-watchable films ever made.Granted, after one viewing I'm over-hyping it a bit. There are some undeniable issues with True Romance, like how everything happens so easily for Clarence. There are some consequences for his character here and there, but for the most part, he gets away with what he wants and it all comes very easily for a guy who was just presented to be a nerd from Detroit. I also don't feel like the ending completely wraps up what it needs to. In classic Tarantino fashion, things happen really fast and in a chaotic and unexpected nature, therefore leaving a few strings loose in the end. Seemingly leaving the door open for a sequel, which never came.In all though, True Romance is a film that is as enjoyable to watch as it probably was to film. Everything was hitting on all cylinders, and it became a classic many years later for it.8.4/10",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
10 reasons to state this is one of the greatest movies ever!,"Sure, purely talking cinema, True Romance isn't the most perfect film ever made (it's not boring enough for that). But, when it comes to entertainment values and coolness, this motion picture yet has to find an equal. Any first viewing of True Romance will literally blow you away and repeated viewing will only prove that this is one mean, addictive film. Through the years, True Romance built up quite a status and it's immensely popular. Still, too often it's categorized as worthless violence and therefore I'll introduce to you 10 reasons why this film is just brilliant!1. True Romance was the first screenplay written by Quentin TarantinoNow, it's unquestionable that Tarantino is one of the most gifted writers in cinema ever and this first work of his excellently reflects his enthusiasm and talent. The protagonist  Clarence Worley  has a lot in common with Quentin's own personality and because of this; True Romance actually looks like one giant daydream/fantasy of an imaginative adolescent.2. The choice of Tony Scott as the director. Unlike Oliver Stone in Natural Born Killers, Scott didn't feel the need to oppress his own visual style in True Romance. Yet, he adds a little more flair than QT would himself, so what you get is some sort of explosive crossover between Reservoir Dogs and Top Gun.3. The all-star Cast!!!! Man, would you look at that cast! Some of Hollywood's best performers of every generation are there. Some of them only have miniscule roles but their presence is an extra added value, anyway. Christian Slater, Patricia Arquette, Val Kilmer, Gary Oldman, Dennis Hopper, Christopher Walken, James Gandolfini, Brad Pitt, Michael Rapaport, Bronson Pinchot, Samuel L. Jackson, Chris Penn, Tom Sizemore, Victor Argo4. Every single personality in True Romance is adorably eccentric and worth analyzing. Clarence and Alabama are the 'good guys', yet they're pretty messed up in their heads themselves. Basically, every person in this film is a self-centered weirdo driven by mad thoughts and insanity. As a result of this, superb and colorful dialogues are overwhelming you. Excellent, first-class quote material.5. The romantic on screen chemistry between Clarence and AlabamaEven though the plot may seem extremely illogical and far-fetched, the love and devotion between these two feels sincere and intense. Their interactions and sexual escapades increase the viewer's involvement.6. That one particular sequence Fans certainly will know what I'm talking about now! A tour-de-force between two of the talented actors ever, resulting in a breath-taking climax. Walken and Hopper's acting almost burns holes in your TV-screen and you can almost feel the cigarette smoke prickling in your eyes. Guided by chilling classical music and shot beyond perfection, this surely is one of most intense sequences ever caught on tape.7. The trivia elements and references towards other films. QT is an absolute film geek and he terrifically inserts his passion in his script. In many of the dialogues, the characters (Clarence in particular) constantly refer to cinema milestones like Rio Bravo, The Good, the Bad and the Ugly and Dr. Zhivago. True Romance also is one giant tribute to the King of Rock 'n Roll himself as Clarence is a dedicated Elvis admirer.8. The Soundtrack! Tarantino films always have blasting soundtracks and True Romance isn't an exception. The main theme is a brilliant instrumental song by Hans Zimmer while the rest of the soundtrack mixes classic oldies and modern songs.9. The coolness! Simply putthis just is one cool motion picture. Clarence Worley is cool! He drives a purple Cadillac, wears giant sunglasses and eats hamburgers right after killing a guy. That is COOL! The love of his life is equally cool. She's like the perfect woman who likes Kung-Fu movies, dresses sexy and really knows how to defend herself. When asked where to meet discretely, she playfully answers: 'in the roller coaster!' and that, my friend, is cool.10. The violence! Last but certainly not leastaren't we all a little excited to see massive, grotesque violence? Qua violence, True Romance definitely overtrumps your wickedest expectations. The film contains multiple memorable action sequences and, just when you think you've seen it all, there comes the grand finale! The final sequence is one major adrenalin-rushing shootout, leaving very few to the imagination. Fascinatingly photographed and fun to see.There you go In case you haven't seen True Romance yet, I have no idea what else would convince you to see it. Changes are high this will be one of your personal favorites, for sure. There only is one little turnoff I should mention. True Romance recently got released on Special (double disc) Millennium edition but that was quite a disappointment. The extras don't really feature anything special. I was hoping to see some deleted scenes or something, but there only is a B-roll documentary and a couple of short interviews.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
One of the all time greatest films with arguably the best scene in film history,"True Romance is one of those films where everything just seem to be in the right place at the right time with absolutely no exception. From the soundtrack to the filmography to the production and, quite exemplary the all star at their absolute best. It has everything you want for a film, it's action packed, funny, violent, tense, endearing, and just a rollercoaster ride you will want to ride again and again. I will not give anything away as it would be wrong to do so, but it would be criminal not to mention quite arguably the greatest scene in film history and believe me, this is not an a exaggeration. The scene between Christopher Walken and Dennis Hopper is one that is so convincing and executed it is like watching a work of art come to life. I honestly thought it was improvised but only the end of it is, which is a real testament to the talent of both superb actors.
I believe this to be Tarantinos finest screenplay and the late Tony Scott's greatest work. Please, sit back and watch a classic for the ages",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Crazy Meets Crazy and Falls in Love,"Quentin Tarantino had a certain flare and unmistakable voice as a writer right from the very beginning. 'True Romance' makes that very clear.In this early work of Tarantino, he treats viewers to an avalanche of action and escalating stakes: A kung fu movie buff who works at a comic store (vaguely reminiscent of who Tarantino saw himself to be in his younger days) meets a call girl, falls in love, confronts her pimp, and ultimately flees to California with his new lover and a half million dollars worth of cocaine in a briefcase.The couple are a perfect pairing because they can match each other's crazy. They appear to genuinely fall for each other and support each other's wild choices. Actually, they seem to be turned on by each other's craziness. With a tiny excusal of their warped perception of reality, it becomes easy enough to like these two. If liking them is asking too much, at the very least viewers will be interested in what happens to them.Of course, that is not to say these are good people. Their behavior is questionable at best. But, moral judgment isn't really the point of this movie. It's an elaborate and entertaining story told with witty dialogue and explosive violence.In other words, it's a Tarantino movie.One more thing: the music. Director Tony Scott opted for a score rather than the classic soundtracks Tarantino routinely assembles in his later movies. It turns out the score was the perfect choice. The delightful melody provides dashes of much needed levity in the midst of the carnage.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
The Best Film Tarantino Never Made,"QT wrote this film and it was directed by Tony ""Ridley's Little Brother"" Scott and it is, quite simply, a masterpiece. A violent masterpiece, yes, but a masterpiece nonetheless. Christian Slater must look back on this film with a sense of longing because he has not been given as good a project since (Churchill: The Hollywood Years, anyone?).Patricia Arquette is as cute as anything and perfectly fits her role. Call me crazy, but she really seems to be enjoying playing the ""hooker-with-a-heart-of-gold"". In fact, everyone seems to be loving the hell out of a superb script. The scene between Dennis Hopper and Christopher Walken is one of cinemas greatest ever scenes! The famously egotistical Val Kilmer goes almost unseen as Elvis - sorry, The Mentor - and Brad Pitts now-famous Cleaning Products line was a brilliant ad-lib. Gary Oldman as the white-rasta Drexl is the epitome of nastiness. Even Samuel L Jackson gets a high billing in the credits, but is in the film for less than 5 minutes! Genius. By the way, check out the DVD extended/deleted scene scenes for a longer discussion on cunnilingus. It's hilarious.All in all, this is a collection of brilliantly written scenes, filled with memorable quotes and held together by a sweet, believable and totally mad storyline with a better-than-A-list-cast. Even the tragically underused Ed Lauter gets a look-in. Tom Sizemore and Chris Penn excel as the cops on the trail. The weakest point is Bronson Pinchot, but even he keeps pace well.My only regret is that QT didn't direct it himself. Scott did an EXCELLENT job, but I would like to see QT's version.QT to remake True Romance and Natural Born Killers: The pressure-campaign starts here!10 1/2 out of 10!",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
This is Both - An Irreverent High-Voltage Thriller And A ' Truly Quirky Romance'!,"'True Romance' is a deliciously pulpy romp that saw director Tony Scott bring a burnished visual sheen to an early Quentin Tarantino script. While the title suggests images of hugs, kisses, holding hands, and heartfelt human emotion, the film instead bombards the audience with images of blazing guns, brutal beatings, and lots of gushing blood while telling a twisted and entertaining tale of outlaw lovers on the run.Clarence (Christain Slater in his best role ever) is a comic-book store employee, living a meager but not intolerable life in Detroit. On his birthday night, he meets a pretty blonde hooker named Alabama (Patricia Arquette, reliably efficient and displaying a great chemistry with Slater) and they are soon positively smitten, declaring their love for each other, only to be married a few days later. Clarence goes to see her pimp, Drexl (a truly whacked-out Gary Oldman who devours his ten minutes on screen), with the meeting ending with Clarence killing him and making off with a suitcase. The case, which Clarence thought contained Alabama's clothes, actually contains two-million dollars' worth of cocaine, and this puts this newly-married duo find themselves in quite the thorny predicament. Once the dust - and blood - clears, they decide to trek off to Hollywood to see Clarence's pal who might know some industry folks interested in high-quality coke. Little do they know that Drexl's partners (led by Christopher Walken's quietly malicious Vincenzo) are tracking them and intend to get their merchandise back, eliminating the couple for good measure.True Romance is a paper-thin but enjoyably quirky romance carried by great dialogue, an unpredictable plot, and a cast of wildly original characters. The storyline is far from earth-shattering, but it guarantees some good escapist fun, especially since the script boasts a few scenes possessive of great wit and sparkle, along with a show-stopping one chock-full of dynamic psychological tension – between Dennis Hopper (who brings a phenomenal degree of warmth as Clarence's father) and Christopher Walken, whose ""vendetta kinda mood"" head-to-head became one of the most memorable sparrings of cinema. Many people may be turned off by the graphic and sometimes savage violence of True Romance. But that is only part of the dirty, funny and unpredictably violent genius of Mr. Tarantino. Tarantino and Tony Scott never pretend that the film is more than what it is - slickly entertaining trash.Eventually, it is Tarantino's gutter poetry that detonates True Romance. This movie is dynamite - a hip, clever and irreverent high-voltage thriller with nary a dull moment!",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Max Julien, RIP","Cult star Max Julien (of ""The Mack"") died recently, making the mention of him in Tony Scott's ""True Romance"" all the more significant. Written by Quentin Tarantino, this movie has just about every shocking thing that you can imagine, and they do it all perfectly. Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette play newlyweds who flee Detroit to escape some mobsters, but I can't do the movie justice by describing the plot. Slater and Arquette, along with Gary Oldman, Val Kilmer, Dennis Hopper, Christopher Walken, Samuel L. Jackson, James Gandolfini, Brad Pitt, Bronson Pinchot, Tom Sizemore, Chris Penn, Michael Rapaport, Conchata Ferrell and Saul Rubinek put on some of the best performances that you'll ever see.

Bloody Wild Romance,"At times, 'True Romance' reminded me of David Lynch's 'Wild At Heart' and Oliver Stone's 'Natural Born Killers' (the latter came out much later). Even though there has been movies based on similar storyline 'True Romance' has a lot of stuff that makes it its own movie. Yet, I cannot shake the idea that perhaps had I watched the film during the time of its release and not seen the other similar films that have been made since, I might have enjoyed 'True Romance' a bit more. 'True Romance' is very much a pulp fiction itself (no pun intended as Tarantino wrote the screenplay). It's got the hooker with a big heart, the 'nobody' who finds a reason to live, a fake Rastafarian pimp who thinks he's black, the mobster, the cops, blood, murder, violence, drugs....and there's enough energy to entice the viewer. I enjoyed the numerous Elvis references, the wicked humour, the dialogues, the characters and the performances. Tony Scott does a fine job as director. Christian Slater is great as the likable 'nobody' and Patricia Arquette is brilliant as sweet hooker Alabama. Christopher Walken, Dennis Hopper, Gary Oldman and James Gandolfini are outstanding. Fans of pulp fiction may enjoy this more than others but even otherwise it was a fun Saturday night watch for me after a tiring day.",,Anonymous,Romance

You got a lot heart kid.,"Clarence (Christian Slater) is a fanatical elvis fan. So fanatical that he thinks Elvis talks to him. He lives an ordinary life in a pop culture store until the night he stumbles upon and falls in love with call girl Alabama (Patricia Arquette). When Clarence confronts Alabama's pimp drexel (Gary Oldman) a psychopathic gangster. His life takes a turn. He finds himself in situation between the mob, the police and drugs.This is 1 of many of my all time favourite movies. The screenplay was written by Quentin Tarantino and sold to Tony Scott to fund Pupl Fiction. With Tony Scott's glossed direction and camera work and Tarantino's story we have an amazingly fun ride. Great performances from the cast and Arquette is just stunning (to look at too) as Alabama. A must see for Tarantino fans!! Classic!!",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
True Trash,"You know when you've done a huge load of dishes and there's lots of dregs stuck in the plug? It might have been part of something nice to begin with but there's no way you'd touch it now. That's True Romance - a gutter trash fiction roller-coaster powered by pop-culture references and overdone Tarantino dialogue. The story and execution are so adolescent and grim that I am surprised that it wasn't actually written and directed by an angry 15-year-old with mental health problems.Since James Gandofini died a few days ago and since it's actually Tony Scott's birthday today I figured I would give this film another go. Time has not been kind to True Romance, even by 1993 standards the film looks dated. This was the fourth, and last, film Tony Scott made with cinematographer Jeffrey Kimball with whom he always used smoky diffusion to fog up the frame. It doesn't look good.The story has Christian Slater's comic-book geek get together with Patricia Arquette's dim-witted hooker and go on a killing spree for a pathetic amount of quick, easy money. Apparently it was one half of Natural Born Killer's before Tarantino split it into a new screenplay, but he forgot to distance Clarence and Alabama from Mickey and Mallory. True Romance is a thoroughly ugly, sadistic, mean-spirited, nasty film filled with characters who have absolutely no morals or redeeming qualities (well, Patricia Arquette has a couple attached to her chest). There's no one to root for or identify with. Why should I care what happens to any of these psychopaths? And where's the romance? Making Clarence and Alabama have sex in awkward locations or have them kiss and make-out in every other scene doesn't mean that they are high on love. I'm not feeling any romance with this one. There's no sense of liberation or exciting new chances, just gloom and darkness.The saving grace comes in the form of many cameos from Christopher Walken, Gary Oldman, Dennis Hopper, and Saul Rubinek (playing, but pretending not to, a Joel Silver-type producer). Chris Penn and Tom Sizemore pop up but they don't get a chance to bring much to the story as it is already building to a climax by that point. I can't recommend this any fans of crime fiction, romantics, or even fans of Tony Scott. Sure the sycophantic Tarantino fans will get a kick out of it, but I doubt I will ever be watching this reprehensible junk ever again.",4.0,Anonymous,Romance
I'm not what they call Florida White Trash!,"Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette make an outstanding couple in this film that had enough stars for several summer hits.Directed by Tony Scott and written by Quenton Tarantino, you know there was going to be explosive action, too.I couldn't even recognize Gary Oldman, but he got all nasty over Slater - ""He must have thought it was White Boy Day."" He never expected what Slater had in mind. And, guess what? Her clothes were not in the bag he took! I always like seeing Dennis Hopper. he just makes a movie more interesting. I'm sure he didn't want to meet Christopher Walken. He brought James Gandolfini with him - a formidable pair. He shouldn't have told that story about the Moors and my people. Gandofini did OK with Hopper, but he should have never messed with Arquette.Wow! Bronson Pinchot, Michael Rapaport, Brad Pitt and Saul Rubinek, too.What an ending!!!! A magnificent script and a soundtrack to die for.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Dialogue is awesome,"Although True Romance is directed by Tony Scott, the screenplay has Tarantino written all over it, which is a good thing, cause the funny, street smart dialogue is the best thing about the movie, you could say it's what fuels it.The movie is filled with cameos and great actors, including Christian Slater, Patricia Arquette, Brad Pitt and more. But I really have to praise Gary Oldman as the crazy pimp in this movie. Although he doesn't get much screen time, by far one of the best performances of all time. Dennis Hopper and Christopher Walken also stand out in this movie, especially in a scene they share together. Oh and James Gandolfini is also in this one.Like I said, the dialogue is amazing but I don't think the movie always goes down as smoothly as Tony Scott would have liked it to. It just feels to me that the pacing is kinda off sometimes and the score doesn't help. This is a weird thing for me to say cause Hans Zimmer composed the music for the movie, and I'm a huge fan of his, but I really didn't like the score to this movie, I thought it was annoying.Nevertheless, True Romance is thoroughly entertaining and it's a movie that takes chances. It's not generic, it's not typical and I love that. One can't help but wonder what would have happened if Tarantino had gotten his hands on the camera.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Excellent; funny, sweet, romantic, intense and hot!","This film has to be one of the best films that came out in the 1990's. It has everything an audience could ask for; murder, action, romance, sex, comedy, drama and a great story behind it!Quite possibly my new favorite (written-by) Quintin Tarintino film. I can't actually tell you what the film is about without ruining it, but let's just say, it's excellent. It's not a chick flick or a guy movie, it's a little bit of both...but enough of each so that everyone can enjoy.I'm really excited about this film, because it's so cleverly written, with quite a bit of honesty and reality thrown into it, that you can enjoy it without getting frustrated from the unrealisticness of some parts, or the intensity of some of the other scenes.The acting was outstanding, and let's face it Christian Slater is not too ugly to watch in a movie, and Patricia Arquette's breasts had top billing above her name I think. But, she herself was amazing. I don't know if she was nominated for this role, but she should have been, because she was excellent. Probably the best character and actor in the whole movie. A lot stars are in this before they were ""stars"" including; Brad Pitt, Christopher Walken, Dennis Hopper, Michael Rappaport, Bronson Pinchot, and James Gandalfini.I recommend this film to everyone! It's an awesome movie, but mind the rating. It's rated the way it is for a reason. There is some violence and some nudity and sexual content that might not be suitable for some.I hope everyone takes a look...I'm adding it to my collection!",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"I know people that hate this film, but I know far more that love it.","The film was written by Quentin Tarantino, and it really shows with the sharp dialogue and crazy plot. The film centres around Clarence (Christian Slater) who meets and marries Alabama (Patricia Arquette). After Clarence goes to get Alabama's belongings, through a series of mishaps, he ends up with suitcase of coke and they decide to sell it. This leads to a wild adventure involving drug dealers, police and movie executives.The casting in this film is amazing with Hollywood greats turning up and each one adds something special to the film. But by far the best performance is by Brad Pitt as the roommate of Clarence's friend Dick. He is on screen for a total of about 5 minutes but steals every scene he is in. However every one of the characters in the film brings something special. The performances by Hollywood greats, including Dennis Hopper, Christopher Walken and Gary Oldman all come so close to being over the top, but the incredible script and brilliant directing manage to hold back just enough to stop it going too far.This film is a true masterpiece where everything just falls in to place. The film is not for the faint of heart though. There are very graphic scenes of violence. One particular scene involving a woman getting severely beaten. The perpetrator definitely gets his comeuppance though. While the violence is very graphic, as with most of Tarantino's films, it is very bloody but also portrayed in a realistic manor. This adds to the shock and also to bring you closer to the victims.I cannot praise this film enough. It is one of the greats that has been overlooked by many including Hollywood. Almost all of the performances are worthy of Oscar nomination, as with the script. But this film was overlooked by all the major awards.If you are a fan of Tarantino films, or films with a good cast and great story give this film a try. I know people that hate this film, but I know far more that love it.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Tries a bit too hard but is still enjoyable,"When Clarence meets Alabama they hit if off immediately and fall in love. So when she reveals she is a call girl hired to get him laid on his birthday it doesn't matter, and they get married.  Clarence decides to make Alabama's break from the job official by collecting her stuff from her pimp. However when that meeting turns into a bloodbath he mistakenly picks up a suitcase full of drugs.  The pair say their goodbyes and make off with the drugs to sell them in LA, however the drugs leave a track behind them, one that both the mob and the police follow.In the height of Tarantino fever, several of his scripts got quickly dusted off and handed to big name directors in an effort to capitalise on the public flavour for his dialogue and mix of pop culture references and violence.  True Romance was one such film and, in fairness it does fairly well to emulate the films of the writer himself - big cast, snappy dialogue, violent shoot outs and so on.  In fact the film lifts his style to the extent that it even rips off (or homage's) other films - most notably in the theme music that is almost a photocopy of Badlands.The film wears this a little too obviously and clearly is trying very hard to be Tarantino-esque, most of the time it works out but at times I just wanted it to relax a little bit.  The plot is pure geek wish fulfilment mixed with crime thriller; a beautiful woman picks up a comic-book fan in a cinema showing a martial arts triple bill!  It works reasonably well by filling the scenes with colourful characters, pop culture dialogue and violence - at times it gets a bit much and I wanted characters to talk normally without a wall-to-wall soundtrack just some of the time; however it does have some very good scenes at times.  Stand outs are the scene with Walken and Hopper and the scene where Alabama takes a beating, but, if you like Tarantino's films then you should be happy with most of this.The style of the film is a little uneven.  As I said, it is really trying hard to be a Tarantino film but at the same time you can see Scott's glossy action-movie hands all over it!  The two don't really fit together all the time and would honestly rather have had a different director at the helm. The cast however is as deep as Tarantino films were drawing at the time - everyone wanted the chance to be cool!  Slater is cool and fits the role well and even Arquette manages to be quite good, although her narration is about as flat and dull as they come.  It is the support cast though, who the film belongs to.  The film has roles for a variety of people whether it be non-speaking roles or one or two scenes.  In a way this is a bad thing because some great actors have nothing to do and are wasted but overall the effect is good and each cameo makes an impact.  When a cast includes Val Kilmer, Dennis Hopper, Gary Oldman, Brad Pitt, Christopher Walken, Bronson Pinchot, Samuel L Jackson, Victor Argo, Michael Rapaport, Saul Rubinek, James Gandolfini, Chris Penn and Tom Sizemore it has to be at least worth checking out!Despite the fact that Tarantino's words in another directors hands doesn't feel that right, and the fact that Scott's very slick Hollywood direction doesn't quite match with Tarantino's much less establishment writing this is still a good film.  As you'd expect it rips off every `lovers on the run' movie that you'll have seen but it still is funny and slick enough to stand up for the rather generous running time.  It may bottle the brave ending of the original script but it has some very good scenes along the way.",,Anonymous,Romance
I wish I could figure out the love for this movie,"Yes, Tarantino's writing was good. Yes Oldman and Gandolfini were amazing. But overall, the story just didnt seem grounded in reality. While the dialogue was great at times, other aspects simply wouldnt have been accurate. Definitely a ton of talent in this, a shocking amount. But I feel if Tarantino would have directed this, it would have won an Oscar. Oh, and the music absolutely sucks in this movie.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
A gift to entertainment,"Super satisfied to be directed to this movie and very upset I never took the time to view their earlier in my life. 'True Romance' is a treat from start to finish. Piling on an endless barrage of action, comedy, romance, mystery, suspense, and add any other element, this flick probably has it without ever feeling too much. The script very obviously projects Tarantino's influence, making this a treat to the Tarantino fans. The acting from everyone that appears on screen is excellent. If you have never seen this film before, you will see titans within the movie industry appear with such minor roles yet are so satisfying to see. The film as a whole is a fast-paced roller coaster ride, consistently entertaining the viewers with each moment that passes. The material within this film alone could fuel hundreds of other films.

"A stepping stone to ""Pulp Fiction""","A lonesome comic store geek in Detroit (Christian Slater) meets the woman of his dreams (Patricia Arquette) and suddenly has the gonads to be a bad dude. But the mob tracks the couple down in Los Angeles with all guns blazing. The peripheral cast includes the likes of Gary Oldman, Dennis Hopper, Christopher Walken, Samuel L. Jackson, Val Kilmer, Brad Pitt, Bronson Pinchotand and Saul Rubinek.""True Romance"" (1993) is a crime drama/thriller/romance and black comedy directed by Tony Scott (younger brother of Ridley) and written by Quentin Tarantino. The latter sold the script to fund his first movie ""Reservoir Dogs"" (1992). It contains the ultra-violence/gore that Tarantino is known for, along with his satirical, comic book style that makes it more amusing than shocking.While the all-star cast is incredible and there are several great scenes, something keeps ""True Romance"" from the top tier of ""Pulp Fiction"" (1994) and ""Jackie Brown"" (1997). I suppose it doesn't help that the protagonist's sudden transformation isn't convincing, not to mention that what he does is unnecessary and perilous (i.e. stupid), which turns him into a bit of a creepy nutzoid. But that's just me.Imagine being blown away by the greatest album by a band and then purchasing their previous album, which is good, but not in the same league. You like it, but you're also a little letdown. That's how ""True Romance"" comes across after viewing ""Pulp Fiction."" Nevertheless, it's still worthwhile if you don't mind this genre.The script was originally written in a nonlinear structure, which Tarantino is known for, but Tony Scott changed the story to chronological, as well as altered the ending, which made for a morally confused message. Quentin's original version would've worked better, preferably directed by him.The film runs 1 hour, 59 minutes, and was shot in Detroit and the Los Angeles area.GRADE: B-",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Still Brilliant,"Nearly 28 years after first seeing this masterpiece it hasn't lost any of it's charm. Charm is indeed a strange word for a movie with so many deaths, but unlike a lot of films it has a heart. Most of this is because of Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette as Clarence and Alabama, they are so brilliant in this I don't think either has surpassed this. It also has an amazing class that includes Walken, Hopper, Kilmer and Oldman. Two scenes stand out, Hopper and Walken plus Gandolfini and Arquette, both are excellent with superb performances. Great ending too with a brilliant ending, one of the best films of the nineties.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Definition of Cool,"True Romance is one of my favorite movies. In actuality, the only reason I ever watched it is because of Brad Pitt's character Floyd, the lazy stoner who sits on the couch watching TV all day. If for that reason, I could give it 8 stars I would, but I think it's best left where it stands.The movie is about a guy who works in a video store, and on his birthday his employer buys him a hooker. They fall in love, and he kills her pimp, and steals his cocaine too. They flee, and the gangsters chase. He tried to sell the cocaine to a famous film producer, and everyone dies at the end, except the man character and his wife, the hooker.Now this is a really cool movie. Everything about it is just cool. I may not have expressed it as much, but the story is very well written.

"Suffers from the usual Tarantino problems as well as a few of Scott's, but is still an entertaining and brutally tense adventure.","The ending feels tacked on and tonally troubled, though incidentally it isn't the ending that Tarantino wrote and represents the only major story change that took place during the feature's journey from page to screen - aside from a rejigging of the chronology, which is mostly inconsequential and might even be an improvement on the piece. It punctuates Scott's own romantic, fairy-tale view of a story which should really represent a heightened-reality retelling of 'Bonnie and Clyde' - grim ending and all. 'True Romance (1993)' suffers from the usual problems that plague this writer's work, but is still a highly entertaining and brutal picture that shows off its astute pop-culture sensibilities, excruciatingly long moments of nail-biting tension and brilliantly explosive sequences of violence with pride. Plus, that 'Sicilian' scene really is as fantastic as everyone says. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

Pretty fun,"No doubt, perhaps there could've been more fluidity in this, but it doesn't matter. The two leads are exquisite, both injecting their characters with a lot of charm and humanity despite all of the things they are embarking on and doing. That's a real achievement. It's maybe not as great of a film as it clearly aimed to be, sort of similar to other classics of older eras or even classics of its own era, but it's remember rather well, and that's impressive. I really saw it because of Patricia Arquette, and she shines here surely. I think it's a film that will be very hard to dislike for most people, and it's something that will be so much fun to most.",,Anonymous,Romance
"With Plenty to Praise and Little to Deride, 'TR' is a Worthy Film","It's interesting to note that this same screenplay spawned 'Natural Born Killers' the year after 'True Romance' was released. I love that movie to pieces and it has a lot more to say than this one, but that should not be taken as an affront to an enjoyable film- which is exactly what 'True Romance' is. Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette are Clarence and Alabama Worley, two relative innocents- a comic-book store clerk and a call girl- who fall in love after his boss hires her to sleep with him. He develops an instant hatred for her pimp, so he puts a gun in his sock and goes to visit. Her pimp is Drexl, played by Gary Oldman as a half frighteningly realistic and half laughable 'wigger'. A shootout commences, from which Clarence flees with a suitcase filled not with Alabama's things as he had though, but with cocaine. He realizes he and Alabama could definately use the kind of money that can be made off selling it, so they skip town and head to L.A. after briefly visiting his dad. From there they get mixed up with a famous actor named Elliott, an aspiring one named Dick, Dick's pothead couch potato roommate, Floyd, and a whole gallery of folks who want them dead. 'True Romance' ends well but goes at a fast clip and feels shorter than what it is- for one thing, the time is never taken to develop the sense of inevitability of love between Clarence and Alabama that was created between Mickey and Mallory Knox. Nonetheless, Christian Slater is enjoyable as a guy who knows he's in over his head but is trying to do his best in the situation, and Patricia Arquette has one of her best roles in that guy's cute, not-as-dumb-as-she-seems wife. Her scene with the goon sent to collect the cocaine from their hotel room is both nauseating (who wants to see our heroine get her face bashed in?) and terrific, (how often do you get to see a woman win a brawl this nasty in the movies?) and from it and her ending voice-over, you know that this woman is a survivor through and through. Fun, well-done, and fast-paced, 'True Romance' is a worthy companion film to 'NBK' or, indeed, just about any of the other movies Tarantino has scripted.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Decent, but not a classic","For this time, this was pretty good, but viewed after the passage of time, you can see all of the affectations that Tarantino puts into all of his stuff here in the early stages (old movie talk, violent shoot outs, etc). That's not to say this is a bad movie, it's well made, with lots of stars in bit parts and is well shot, but it's hardly an all time great. Arquette has zero character other than loving Slater and dressing ""quirky"" while Slater's character is just a Tarantino clone who loves Elvis. Everyone else is pretty much a trope, and that works out fine for a genre movie, but it's certainly not anything deeper or better. For Tony Scott, its one of his best though.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
A boy's dream,"""True Romance"" is a peculiar movie. While it caters to all the action-kinda-romance-kinda-comedy-kinda-immature movie clichées, it still manages to put on an entertaining, and in many ways original, show. This movie is a boy's dream (of a boy, let's say, between 13 and 25) since the lead character (""Clarence"") gets to have a job which seems to amount to reading comic books all day long, gets to meet, and win, a knockout girl who just happens to have the same interests as he (i.e. comic books, kung-fu movies, Elvis, etc), gets to drive all the way from Detroit to Los Angeles with a case full of coke (which they ""innocently"" plan to have transformed into a case full of money), all the time outsmarting criminals and policemen alike just like in....that's right!: the movies. It's clearly evident that this screenplay has been written by ""the one and only"" (you can interpret that expression in any way you like) Quentin Tarantino as the characters discuss things like Elvis's good looks and bad TV shows with the same intensity as if their lives depended on it. Almost in spite of itself, though, this movie feels original. For example, the relationship of Clarence and Alabama feels quite original, genuine and even sexy. And then there is, of course, that outstanding ""interrogation scene"" with Dennis Hopper and Christopher Walken. Clarence's father, played by Hopper, knows for sure that his last moment has come when he is captured and interrogated by the Mafia guys. He knows for certain that they are never going to let him walk. He knows that he's going to die, so he decides to keep his honor and integrity to the very last minute and tells Christopher Walken ""the story about Sicilians' ancestry"" which, of course, amounts to his very own death penalty. This scene is great, played by two great actors.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
A True Romance From The World's Blackest Heart,"Even though he didn't direct it (but he did write the script), True Romance had Quentin Tarantino's trademark stink smeared all over it.Predictably fortified by one gory, Rambo-style killing after another (like, would you really have bothered to watch this film if this wasn't the case?), True Romance (a mighty grim, grimy, bleak tale of crime that's as old as bones) was your typical Tarantino trash.Filled to over-flowing with endless Tarantino-type dialog (generously punctuated, for good measure, by the all-mighty F-word), True Romance's endless array of quirky characters (that even included a trailer-trash slut with a heart of gold) babble a blue streak, but, typically end up saying nothing in the least bit worthwhile.I mean, for all of the jabber that goes on, True Romance doesn't contain one single quotable or memorable line in its entire 2-hour running time.From Detroit to L.A., our delusional hero, Clarence (who justifies murder because Elvis Presley told him to do it) and his blushing bride, the flaky floozy, Alabama, are on the lam and being hotly pursued by cops and criminals, alike. It's the suitcase full of cocaine that everyone's after and, like, who gives a bloody damn how many people have to die for somebody, anybody, to get their greedy mitts on this jackpot.Some people tend to put the blame for True Romance's considerable shortcomings squarely onto the shoulders of its director, Tony Scott (Ridley's bro'). But, personally, I think that Scott (who has clearly proved his competent directorial abilities, time and again) could only do what he could do, considering the dismal source of the inferior script that he was expected to work with in order to make something entertaining out of it.",2.0,Anonymous,Romance

wow,"This was probably one of my favorite movies of all time, up there with City of God. By far the most loaded cast that I have ever seen in a movie. By having so many big-name actors (though they may not have been as big at the time) the scenes are made so much more important because despite being leading men, most of the guys are only in a handful of scenes. This transcendence made every scene not only extremely important to the movie's plot, but also very entertaining. It also helped to make the movie more suspenseful because being a 'big name' did not mean that that actor would survive certain circumstances that they might normally. All in all this movie was absolutely amazing and it is more than worth the two hours you will spend entranced by one of Tarantino's most masterfully written stories.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Great film but - that problematic scene now detracts...,"The everyday dialogue laced with humour coming from Tarantino-involved films is the best part of them for me and True Romance is a great hi-energy movie with plenty of snappy lines. But (and this is now looking at it from 2022) the reason it scores 6 for me is that problematic Christopher Walken/Dennis Hopper scene. The dialogue there is so full on that it breaks through the screen and have you thinking about whether you should be enjoying watching the movie, or taking more from it, or analysing the issues stemming from the dialogue. I suspect it wasn't intended to do that, but the impact of it for me is that it detracts from a great movie by making you think too much.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
"""Hey, get some beer, and some....cleaning products.""","This is a great movie, a cool movie, a funny movie and an action movie. Directed by Tony Scott, one of the best (if not the best) action movie directors around, True Romance is the story of Alabama (Arquette) and Clarence (Slater) young newlywed lovers on the run with a stolen suitcase full of $5m worth of the mafia's coke, which they intend to sell. But as the old saying goes, the path to true love never runs smooth and a battle of wits ensues between Clarence, the police and the mob leading to a classic finale in this action packed film. As a whole, this movie works beautifully but on DVD it's even better because you can access all your favorite classic scenes that unmistakeably bare Tarantino's hallmark again and again. Such as the opening scene where the heterosexual Clarence (Slater) states that he'd sleep with Elvis if he were still alive, or the showdown between Clarence and dread-locked gangster (Oldman). Or the showdown between the mob boss (Walken) and Clarence's Dad (Hopper). Classic scenes indeed, particularly the one with Walken and Hopper.Also some other great performers that make this movie as entertaining as it is, are: Michael Rappaport as the dopey aspiring actor (auditioning, of all things, for a one-time role as Crook #2 for an episode of ""T.J. Hooker"" that is set to co-star Peter Breck!), Chris Penn and Tom Sizemore as over-zealous narc squad partners, and Bronson Pinchot is wonderfully whiny as a movie producer's whipping boy and go-fer named Elliot. So I suggest you sit back, relax, and suspend disbelief while you are taken on a very strange and very satisfying ride through a lesser known piece of the Quentin Tarantino universe.Overall rating: 8 out of 10.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Watching one of Tarantino's first screenplays come to life was enjoyable, but there's not much else to it","True Romance failed to interest me enough. I didn't really care about anyone or anything. It was interesting watching one of Tarantino's very first screenplays come to life, and it was actually pretty good, however it was nowhere near as creative as the other films he wrote. This isn't exactly what Tony Scott does best. While The Last Boy Scout and Beverly Hills Cop II were directed with skill, he fails to fully satisfy with True Romance. I've always wondered how this movie would turn out if Tarantino had directed it instead. He could probably have done it better. But ultimately, the plot is so poor that even if Tarantino would direct it, it would still be a sinking ship.Christian Slater and Juliette Lewis are pretty good though, but what really saves True Romance is the exceptionally great supporting cast, notably Gary Oldman and Christopher Walken, who deliver top-notch performances. They are, without a doubt, the best thing about this movie, despite their screen time is no longer than 10 minutes combined. Another supporting role worth mentioning is Brad Pitt in a two-minute role. His character is a major influence on stoner comedies later on, and it is this small role that, in my opinion, was the first to define how good his acting abilities actually is.Overall, True Romance is worth the price of admission, because of the great supporting cast and Tarantino's (occassionally) good writing. - Moose finds this film worthy of an 8.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Trash,"`True Romance' has got to be the most overrated movie.  It has a sensational cast and, what could have been, decent story but it was completely misdirected.  There was no nuance in the direction.  It was all violence and excess.  Christian Slater was a waste and Patricia Arquette was there for her body.  There were some bright spots because of the cast.  The scene with Dennis Hopper and Christopher Walken was good and could have been great except for the subject matter which I thought was in very poor taste, even for this movie.

The scene with Patricia Arquette and James Gandolfini is quite emotional as well. This scene catapulted Gandolfini into the go to guy if you wanted a believable old school mafioso in your film and most likely helped him get his award winning role as the head of the Soprano family. I guarantee, if you love a violent well written underdog story you will love this film. The tension filled final scene will leave you breathless and wanting more but in the greatest way possible.

True Romance: 6/10,"As much as I love Quentin Tarantino (well...love his movies), he does get pretty pretentious at times. One prime example was Kill Bill: Volume Two, where he thinks his dialogue is so good that he forgets that it's only good dialogue in a Tarantino fashion if it's funny, also. The same thing happened to True Romance. Often, Tarantino's writing is memorable, making his movies memorable and immortal. Although I'm behind on reviews, so I saw this movie a few weeks ago, I remember almost nothing from this film. There are some speeches characters give that could go down next to the ""Royale with Cheese"" sequence from Pulp Fiction, but, alas, they don't for a variety of reasons.Clarence (Christian Slater) is a typical loser. His boss hires prostitute Alabama (Patricia Arquette) to have sex with him on his birthday, and before they know it, they're married. Clarence kills her pimp (Gary Oldman), steals cocaine from him, and goes to Hollywood looking to sell it. The pimp's men go out to chase them. What an exciting story.I'm not going to blame it all on Tarantino. Much of the problem should be directed to director Tony Scott. You may remember him as being the one who took a possibility for a great movie called Man on Fire, chewed it up, spit it back out, and turned it into total crap. He shows more restraint here, making True Romance bearable and, at times, exciting. But nothing in it is memorable-the shootoff in Reservoir Dogs (which wasn't memorable per se) was more memorable. The characters weren't memorable, the scenes and speeches weren't memorable, and most of the movie wasn't memorable. I'm getting ahead of myself. I'm making True Romance out to be this awful movie. It really isn't.Some of the movie was interesting (for then), and there's a great scene between Dennis Hopper and Christopher Walken. It doesn't resonate with me now, but as I was watching the movie, I was thinking how cool it was. While the characters weren't really defined much, they were acted well throughout. Samuel L. Jackson could have done more, though. Then again, Sam Jackson eating cottage cheese is exciting for me. But I digress. True Romance is nowhere near the potential Tarantino has, but if you watch it, you'll probably enjoy it. But don't think about it afterwards or you'll not like it as much.My rating: 6/10Rated R for violence, language, and drug use.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
One of the best movies ever made,"This movie is criminally underseen. It's one of the flicks Tarantino has ever written and Tony Scott has ever filmed. Filled with romance, inspired characters, solid charasmatic performances and ultra violence this is without a doubt one of my favorite films. The film tells the tale of Alabama played by an amazing Patricia Arquette and Clarence a ""so cool"" Christian Slater in possibly his best performance. Shes a call girl his friends hire for him. They immediately fall in love and he tries to free her from her violent pimp played by a surprising Gary Oldman. It of course goes wrong and he ends up grabbing the wrong suitcase, one filled with cocaine. They of course go on down to Hollywood to try and sell it and before they know it they have the cops, the mafia and a bunch of criminals after them. The movie is well written the screenplay is smart and overly romantic with some great comedy and action. And it's all just so well executed by Tony Scott. It's really one of the best films ever. Although it floundered at the box office it has since found a most deserved cult following. Dennis Hopper, Christopher Walken, Brad Pitt, James Gandolfini, Michael Rappaport, Chris Penn, Val Kilmer, Samuel L. Jackson, Saul Rubinek, Conchata Ferrell and Tom Sizemore also star.Budget: $12.5M
Box Office: $12.3M9/10",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Underrated Action Flick.,"My Rating : 7/10I've only heard about 'True Romance' because of internet users giving it praise. It's full of character actors such as Christopher Walken, Gary Oldman, Dennis Hopper, James Gandolfini, Michael Rapaport, Val Kilmer and there's Brad Pitt in it too as a couch potato roommate/stoner guy. Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette make for a quirky couple and carry the film well on their shoulders.It's a typical Tarantino flick (he's the screenplay writer after all) with loads of action, violence, drugs, cussing and a love story thrown in for good measure.If you don't mind a bit of action and violence give this a go.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

An Excellent And Powerful Classic With An Amazing Cast. Tony Scott(RIP)And Quentin Tarantino At Their Best.,"True Romance is an excellent and powerful classic that mixes Action,Romance and Crime Drama. Filled with great direction,a masterful screenplay by Quentin Tarantino,an amazing cast and a wonderful soundtrack,True Romance is Tony Scott and Quentin Tarantino at their best.True Romance tells the story of Clarence Worley(Christian Slater),a comic book store clerk who while out celebrating his birthday meets up with a hooker named Alabama(Patricia Arquette). After one night of romance and sex the two fall in love and get married. When Alabama wants to get out of her life as a hooker,Clarence decides to get her briefcase of clothes only to discover that the briefcase of full of bags of cocaine that belongs to the mob. Now,with Clarence and Alabama heading to Los Angeles for their honeymoon,the couple have to deal with Gangsters,Cops and tons of danger and violence.Released in 1993,True Romance is a classic film that despite being directed by Tony Scott,written by Quentin Tarantino and receiving rave reviews from critics was a Box Office failure and ignored by audiences. But thanks to the worldwide critical and Box Office success of Tarantino's masterpiece Pulp Fiction,True Romance was rediscovered by audiences on home video and cable and became a Cult film and a classic and the praise is well deserved. True Romance is great film that just flawlessly mixes Action,Crime Drama and Romance all within two hours and just grabs you by the throat until the very end. It's a film that thrills and excites you with suspense,drama and Action and gives viewers a truly amazing and unforgettable cinematic experience that you will never ever forget. It's a wild and unpredictable journey that is surreal and politically incorrect and it just stays with you after you watch it. TR is a beautiful love story set in the dark world of drugs and violence and you see the great balance of a love story and the dark violence that hangs over the film and that's what makes TR very clever and original. Although TR was directed by Tony Scott,TR is truly a Quentin Tarantino film through and through. The screenplay by Tarantino is brilliant and unforgettable and has all of the trademarks that are often associated with Tarantino's other films:pop culture references,sharp dialog,black Humor and memorable well-written characters. The dialog and characters in the film are amazing,fresh and original with each scene of the main characters and dialog just coming alive and explodes with fire and intensity. Each main character who's in the film for a long or short period of time will stay with viewers because Tarantino's script and Scott's direction allow them too and each main character commands the screen. Tarantino has said that TR is his most personal screenplay and it is true with references to Kung Fu films,love for movies and comic books and references to other films. Clarence and Alabama are great characters because they feel real and true and when you see Clarence and Alabama say that they love each other it doesn't feel forced or fake but very romantic and powerful. And despite the violence and chaos all around them,Clarence and Alabama stand by each other. Clarence and Albama are two characters you won't forget. The Action scenes in the film are great and brutal and the thing that I love about each Action scene in the film is that there is great build up and suspense with dialog and when the dialog and build up ends it explodes with violence. Tony Scott brings the same brutal violence and cynical style he brought two years before in his Action classic The Last Boy Scout and does it without missing a beat. The ending of the film is amazing and when the ending happens it's very explosive and at the same time optimistic and truly beautiful for the main characters Clarence and Alabama. It's an amazing and wonderful ending that will make viewers smile and cheer and is a great cap off to this classic film.The whole cast is masterful. Christian Slater and Patrica Arquette are excellent and their best as Clarence and Alabama,with Slater and Arquette bringing intensity,depth and great chemistry to their roles. Dennis Hopper is fantastic as Clifford Worley,Clarence's policeman Father. Val Kilmer is great as Clarence's Mentor in a yellow jacket who like Clarence. Gary Oldman is brilliant as always in his small role as Detroit player Drexl Spivey,Alabama's pimp. Brad Pitt is hilarious and fun as Floyd,Dick's stoner roommate. Christopher Walken is wonderful as Vincent Coccotti,a Detroit gangster. Bronson Pinchot(Elliot),Michael Rapaport(Dick Ritchie),James Gandolfini(RIP)(Virgil),Saul Rubinek(Lee Donowitz),Samuel L. Jackson(Big John),Chris Penn(RIP)(Nicky Dimes),Tom Sizemore(Cody Nicholson)and Anna Thomson(Lucy)give good performances as well.The direction by Tony Scott is brilliant and stylish,with Scott using great camera angles,harsh lighting giving the film a beautiful visual style while Scott also does a wonderful job with the Action scenes. Rest In Peace Tony Scott you are and were one of the greatest Action directors of all time and you left the world too soon. RIP,Scott.The score by Hans Zimmer is beautiful,dark,light and romantic,with Zimmer making the score beautiful and dramatic and matching each scene in the film. Great score by Zimmer.In final word,if you love Tony Scott,Quentin Tarantino,Action Films,Crime Dramas,Romantic love stories or films in general,I highly suggest you see True Romance,an excellent and unforgettable classic that you can watch again and again. Highly Recommended. 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

An under-rated modern classic.,Quite possibly one of the greatest crime films from the 90's. What sets this apart from Tarantino's other early work is that it has heart. It still divides it's critics now in the same way it did in 1993. Everyone in the film gives career best or career defining performances. It has some of the best dialogue ever put to film. An unflinching personal crime fantasy. Quite simply amazing.,10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Who could criticise this film?,"It isn't ""Remains of the Day"". But it is the best film ever made. It's one those films that you can watch over and over and never get tired of it. Especially cool is watching it with someone who's never seen it before. Which I sometimes do whenever possible. True Romance saddles up fine with Pulp Fiction and Fight Club, which I must say are number two and three on my all-time favorite movie list.
Clarence and Alabama are stupid, yes, as many critics are wont to say. But it wouldn't be fun any other way. In other words it is not a cerebral film.
And I've grown to love them both.
Gary Old man gives his best over-the-top performance ever. Nevermind his tor-de-force as Winston Churchill last year. Watch and you won't disagree
Dennis Hopper, as Clarence's dad, brings the film down to earth for a few-- as he's forgivably smitten with Alabama. And he utters the greatest dialogue in a film since Anthony Hopkins as Hannibal Lector described eating a human being. Hateful, hateful dialogue but he pulls it off with a smile on his face as he's soon dispatched by Christopher Walken.
Love Quentin Tarantino's writing.
The grittiest scene belongs to Patricia Arquette. Alabama is discovered alone in the motel by none other than a mad, mad Tony Soprano. James Gandolfini is a superb menace. Waking up to see him in my room would make me piss my pants but Alabama ain't going down easy.
The climax is a bit disappointing. In that all films no matter how great must come to an end.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

Here it is! The most underrated movie of all time.,"""True Romance"" is criminally underrated in terms of how well known it is and how it was received in 1993 by the critics and the public. It hardly won any awards even though the acting is top-class in this movie, as well as the story itself is.Basically this movie is the ultimate guy-movie. Violence, shootouts, cursing, cool characters, all put together in a clever script that is filled with some typical Tarantino dialog and situations. How could you not love this movie? It has some highly memorable sequences in it, mainly thanks to the great cast and acting.The cast of this movie is absolutely amazing. Lot's of well known actors show up in some rather small roles such as Christopher Walken who with his one scene makes such a lasting impression, that you easily forget that he only is in the movie for a few minutes. Same goes for Gary Oldman in a totally flipped role and Samuel L. Jackson who basically only is in for about a minute or so. Other impressive small roles are being played by James Gandolfini, Chris Penn, Tom Sizemore (crazy as always), Michael Rapaport, Victor Argo, Brad Pitt as a hilarious stoner, Ed Lauter, Dennis Hopper, Saul Rubinek, Val Kilmer and Bronson Pinchot. The two main leads, Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette might not be as impressive as the rest of the cast but the supporting cast more than compensates for this.But it really are Gary Oldman, Dennis Hopper and Christopher Walken who steal the show in this movie. Gary Oldman is totally crazy over-the-top as a white pimp who acts- and thinks that he is a black person. The famous sequences between Dennis Hopper and Christopher Walken is a true classic and one of the best acted sequences I have ever seen. Those 10 minutes alone are more than enough to make this movie worth watching. It's such a well written and acted out sequence. It never loses it's power, no matter how often you have already seen it. I think I already know that dialog by heart right now.It's a great story of romance, drugs, stealing and killing. The movie is made very lighthearted, meaning that it's incredible fun to watch. The movie is obviously not made serious, just look at the over-the-top characters and dialog. It's really Quentin Tarantino who deserves most credit for this movie, even though it was Tony Scott who directed the movie.I absolutely love this movie and I never get tired of watching it. The characters, actors and writing are all at their very best. Violent crime movies don't get much better than this one. Great fun from start till finish, an absolute must-see!10/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Great Action Packed, Interesting Crime Story, But Not A True Romance","Everybody was great in the film except two of the main character, Slater and Arquette was good at theirself but not as a couple, i didn't engaged with their relationship, i didn't feel their relationship, and i didn't care about their relationship, everything is going too fast for them, i just not feeling it, it's a great action packed, it's an interesting crime story, but not a True Romance.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

Tarantino's early work,"It was great to see the humble beginnings of Quentin Tarantino. True Romance was the first script he sold. He wanted to direct it himself but no one was willing to give him the chance so Tony Scott got the job. I haven't heard much about Tony Scott but I think with Tarantino directing it would have been a better movie. It lacks that goofy feel that pervades through Tarantino's movies. The love for movies and just plain fun that is so integral to a Tarantino movie is missing in True Romance. Still, True Romance is a good movie. Stylistically influenced by Terence Malick's 1973 film Badlands it also stands as a movie in its own right. Who knew Tarantino was such a sap and could right halfway decent romantic dialogue? The voice-over narration and the background score is where it heavily borrows from Badlands and of course the serial killers on the run. But Alabama and Clarence aren't serial killers on the run. They are just people wanting to start over and try to live a better life, a happier life. But Tarantino will not let them do it easily. There are gangsters, Hollywood movie producers, old friends, drugs, policeman and guys with wires. More often than not Tarantino's movies have a variety of different plot that collide and all hell breaks loose. We witness this again and have a Mexican standoff. I guess that is where the problem lies. Tony Scott just directed the movie and I guess he didn't care so much about the characters and the Mexican standoff became very predictable in the last half hour of the movie and the action scenes were a little too cheesy.The supporting cast features some of the biggest stars of today. Brad Pitt, James Gandolfini to name a few. Back then I guess they were just starting out. It is great fun to see a young James Gandolfini a couple of years before he played Tony Soprano doing what he does best. It's surprising how Michael Rappaport frequently plays the old friend of the lead character. He plays the same character in Beautiful Girls and some Schwarzenegger movie. I guess this was the movie that made him typecast in that role. The cast is decent. I never really like Christian Slater that much. His voice always irritates me but he's done a decent job in the film. The female decent is quite good actually. She is very pretty and plays her role with aplomb. True Romance is about well a True Romance. How two people meet and realize they are perfect for each other. It is about innocence and losing, grabbing chances and trying to struggle for something better. A better future. Because mostly things go wrong. But sometimes they go the other way too . . . . . .

All time favourite movie,"Great characters, great story, genuine romance all coated in Tarantino's early magic. Gary Oldman plays one of the greatest most brutal characters I've seen in Cinema (all be it briefly). James Gandolfini is arguably as brutal and brilliant.

A Masterpiece of Cinematic Storytelling,"Quentin Tarantino's True Romance is a cinematic gem, a film that sparkles with wit, style, and a heart-wrenching emotional core. Tarantino's script is a marvel, a tapestry woven with dialogue that crackles with energy and characters who feel so real, they leap off the screen. The casting is impeccable, with every actor delivering a performance that is both memorable and nuanced.The film's story, a whirlwind romance that takes a dark and violent turn, is a testament to Tarantino's ability to blend genres and subvert expectations. At its heart, True Romance is a love story, a tale of two people who find solace and purpose in each other. But it is also a crime thriller, a gangster film, and a road movie, all seamlessly interwoven into a narrative that is both thrilling and deeply moving.The film is filled with iconic moments, but none more memorable than the scene between Christopher Walken and Dennis Hopper. This extended sequence, a masterclass in acting and filmmaking, is one of the greatest in cinematic history. Walken's performance is a tour de force, a masterclass in understated intensity. Hopper, as always, is a force of nature, delivering a line reading that is both chilling and hilarious.In a time when so many films seem content to churn out formulaic plots and forgettable characters, True Romance is a film that reminds us of the power of storytelling and the importance of strong acting. It is a masterpiece that will continue to be celebrated for generations to come.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

Entertaining and funny with a great cast but it's missing something,"True Romance succeeds very well at being fun, entertaining and exciting. However, it lacks depth in a noticeable way. It lacks an ending, a message. It does go pretty full out but not enough to work only on that level. I felt there was a lack of heart, of sincerity. It is kind of romantic but not really. Not in a profound way. It's a mix-match of crazy scenarios, villains, twists and accidents that don't add together but just distract you along the way.But at least the plot keeps moving and is full of surprises and funny situations. It had me laughing out loud several times. Bronson Pinchot and all the scenes he was in were hilarious. Tom Sizemore and Chris Penn were also very funny. Christian Slater is likable but a bit naive while Patricia Arquette is gorgeous and lovely - she is feminine and caring but also strong.The supporting cast is full of great actors giving excellent performances. Gary Oldman is one of my all-time favourite actors and it's incredible how he vanishes into his weird but menacing character. Christopher Walken is quite intimidating even with his cheeky smile and twinkling eyes. Dennis Hopper is superb and his scene with Walken appears to be one of the most popular movie moments of the 90s. James Gandolfini has a brutal scene with Patricia Arquette that makes a big impact. Brad Pitt is pretty amusing in his 2 minutes or so of screen-time.It's not surprising at all that Tarantino wrote the script. In fact, his screenplay was apparently divided up into both this film and Natural Born Killers. The dialogue isn't on the level of his other movies - it's not as sharp or insightful. I prefer the philosophy and bite of his directorial efforts. But the overall structure is very similar: there are shoot-outs, the threat of torture, drugs, unexpected visitors and trivial conversations. Moreover, Tarantino intended for the scenes to be in a non-chronological order (like Pulp Fiction). It's hard to say if that might have worked better. Tony Scott seems okay as a director but I think he tends to focus on style over substance and fails to give the movie any special mark of his own.One issue I did have was the exploitation of violence and lack of a solid message. Is it really just about a true romance? Considering all the violence and comedy, it obviously doesn't take the idea seriously. But great movies should have some kind of purpose and True Romance clearly lacks that. Confidence is good but it can turn into cockiness.You could throw in some deleted scenes, take certain scenes out and it wouldn't make a difference. The scenes don't build on top of each-other. True Romance is engaging but only as an action comedy thriller, not as a great story. There are no unique insights, no satire or commentary. And it basically glorifies violence. As if it's fun and doesn't have serious consequences.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

This really is the ultimate Quentin Tarantino movie.,"True Romance. Tarantino's first, and ironically enough most original, movie. Though directed by Tony Scott (Top Gun, Enemy of the State) the film remains very faithful to Tarantino's original conception. With the exception of the ending and the trademark Tarantino non-linear storytelling being taken out. There are oh so many things in this movie that Tarantino's later works reference to that it's like a Tarantino fan boy treat! Which I am not anymore. But during my one year time as a fan boy I did read the script of this movie and this was before I even saw the movie. So this being so very faithful to the script you can imagine how psyched i was seeing this movie. I was not disappointed.The movie starts off in not so sunny Detroit with our anti-hero Clarence. Clarence lives a very lonely life with comic books, Kung Fu movies and Elvis as his greatest passions. But one day a woman named Alabama comes into his life. They fall in love instantly and armed with a 38 caliber revolver, a suitcase full of cocaine and most of all love, they set off to sunny Hollywood to try to sell it off and live happily ever after.Many people brand this movie as a narcissistic teenage boy's wet dream. Well it's not. This is supposed to be a fairy tale and it so is. I mean he's a film geek and she's a hot girl. Well it turns out this hot girl likes movies and comics to so they get married. That's every man's dream. Tarantino didn't set out to make a fairy tale when he wrote it but the changes that Tony Scott made (as small as they were) really changed the theme of the movie and made it lighter and more like a fairy tale. Personally I would have really liked to see what the movie would have been like if Tarantino had directed it.This is one of those movies which has a wonderful cast. First there's Christian Slater (....well...True Romance) who plays the character of Clarence very good. Had this been directed by Tarantino in the early nineties the part would have been played by Tarantino himself. Slater plays it with a certain style and this really is his best film ever. I wonder why he doesn't get better parts in movies. Then there's Dennis Hopper (Land of the Dead, Speed) who plays his father in a couple of scenes. The whole movie is worth watching just for him. Gary Oldman (Léon, Lost in Space) plays a very cool role as Drexl the pimp. Good old Gary. Christopher Walken has a small role and plays it very calm and cool. Michael Rapaport, (Friends) who we all know from Friends and Deep Blue Sea, Plays struggling actor Dick Richie and gives a solid performance. And last but most certainly not least there's Chris Penn (rest in peace) as Detective Nicky Dimes. He plays the part with such coolness and style and the film would not be what it is if he weren't in it.""People have asked me: 'So would you ever do a romance movie?' like that's not what I would do. 'Well, I did a romantic movie, True Romance.' 'No, no, I mean like a real romantic movie.' 'Well that is a real romantic movie.' 'No, like one without violence?' 'Well there'll be a lot of things in any movie I do that will be contradictory, but anybody who's a fan of the movie can tell you, the title - True Romance - is not ironic...this is true romance.'"" - Quentin Tarantino.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
A Giddy But Gratuitously Violent Comedic Thriller,"Guns, girls, cigarettes, karate, violence, curses, movies, thugs, Hollywood, motels, fast cars, money, cocaine, mafia bosses, pimps, prostitutes, sunglasses, hamburgers, blood, laughter, Elvis, and romance.I could go on writing lists for hours, but these 24 words are True Romance. Really. If it were a person, it would proudly state that it lives in the United States of America and, chances are, it would probably be a hormonal 15-year-old boy. This might suggest that it is a shallow film, but as it one of Quentin Tarantino's first screen writing jobs, the shallow attributes are lovably shallow rather than stupefying.Tarantino's mind, I assume, resembles a glorified exploitation movie theater, bursting at the seams with Kung-Fu triple features and Spaghetti Westerns, rockabilly music drifting in the background of the foyer. True Romance is a chase movie on crack, exploitative in its violence but charmingly energetic in its dialogue and its acting; it's unbalanced, sometimes off-putting and sometimes gloriously enjoyable.The true romance on display rests on the shoulders of Clarence Worley (Christian Slater) and Alabama Whitman (Patricia Arquette), who marry after a whirlwind night surrounded by movies and bedsheets. Clarence is a comic-book nerd, a friendless average Joe who celebrates his birthday every year by watching a series of Sonny Chiba vehicles; Alabama, in serious contrast, is a prostitute, or, as she puts it, a call girl for the last three days. They're a mismatch made in heaven, he with his skinny, badly-postured mannerisms and she with her red lipstick, beach- blonde hair, and seedy fur coats.Though he's euphoric knowing that he's finally found Mrs. Right, Clarence simply cannot ease into domestic bliss knowing that Alabama's pimp (Gary Oldman) is still sneaking around, possibly looking for her. So, after a long-winded and seriously violent confrontation, he kills him, steals his suitcase of cocaine, and hits the road, his wife in tow.True Romance is directed by Tony Scott and stars Christian Slater, and those are the most prominent obstacles the film encounters in its explosive 120 minutes. When directing, Tarantino generally makes his violence comically bloody, silly even; Scott, on the other hand, doesn't have the same tongue-in-cheek attitude his writer does in terms of bloodletting, not always lining up with Tarantino's cavorting screenplay. The sequence in which Alabama is ruthlessly beat up by one of her dead pimp's associates is so disturbingly brutal that it mismatches the splintery, witty writing of the earlier scenes. Slater, while decent enough to be a distraction instead of a film destroyer, is miscast. His acting is too calculated, too cautious. In a film so unhinged, the lead must be just as unhinged; thank goodness for Arquette, Gary Oldman, and Christopher Walken, who are all tremendous, and, yes, unhinged.That's what makes True Romance so frustrating. 60% worth consists of absolutely brilliantly realized conversations, traveling with the ease of a continuous meet-cute, but the other 40% is composed of heinous violence that doesn't quite match the lurid wink of the remaining 60%.The violence is almost forgivable, but when you find yourself with a clearer image of Dennis Hopper getting his hand sliced open by one of Walken's henchman than Clarence and Alabama's initial meeting, it's much too difficult. But when True Romance is good, it's truly exceptional; there is a reason why so many consider it to be a classic of '90s cinema. Some might praise it for its climactic shoot-em-up, some might root for Clarence and Alabama's unconventional romance, and some might get a kick out of its dialogue. There's something for everybody, but one out of those three people will have a hard time consuming it all with no questions asked.Read more reviews at petersonreviews.com",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

Why he waited until this piece of trash before delivering the goods is anyone's guess.Tony Scott has his photographer shoot with the usual irritating filters, back lighting and blacked out faces presumably because Jeffrey Kimball felt that if you have one photographic idea in fifteen years it's got to be worth repeating.",,Anonymous,Romance
Good atmosphere with some interruptions,"The atmosphere in this movie is splitted. At the beginning in Detroit, things start pretty calm and pictures and scenery create a compelling atmosphere. Later in the plot in LA things start to happen pretty fast bit by bit and the scenes appear scrappy. only when it comes to the showdown, the movie gains back its good created atmosphere.short appearance but very good acting by Christopher Walken. also James Gandolfini and Brad Pitt make short but good performances. Dialogues seems realistic and convincing to me. The end is a little bit constrained happy for my taste and the music gives the romance of the movie a harmonic but at the same time surreal touch, but i find it incongruous.All in all the movie provides a solid story with some palatable surprises but also some lacks in the well established atmosphere from the beginning.

"Solid writing, harsh style","If you compare this to another Tarantino flick (let's go with ""Pulp Fiction""), ""True Romance"" offers a load of memorable bits; the Sicilians conversation; Brad Pitt's classic stoner; Bronson Pinchot; Gandolfini's merciless beating; the absurd shootout at the Ambassador. This movie's full of funny dialogue - and with that, some pretty gruesome violence. For me, it's not very cohesive, and once we leave Detroit for California sunshine (when it goes overboard with the cigarette smoke and filtered light) it loses something. The first act is where the sweetness between Slater and Arquette really shines; once they get the drug deal rolling, we lose Walken and that cute couple and it's a standard Tony Scott movie. We get back to the romance at the end, but by then, I really did miss Walken (and Gary Oldman - man, that guy's nuts).It's the loud and in-your-face style that I wasn't really onboard with. Some Scott movies work pretty well. Some really don't. This was somewhere in the middle. And don't get me wrong, I'm not averse to violence; far from it. But here, it takes control.6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

Doesn't Hold Up,"I enjoyed this movies in my early twenties, when it first came out. I found it stylistic and edgy. Now that I've grown up, or in other words, that I'm not a pretentious 20 something, I found it empty and lacking in substance.Watching it again, hoping to relive that experience of enjoying a great film from the past, I realized this one doesn't travel well. The story is silly, the dialog is, often gratingly, cliche, and though the production is decent, the style of the film feels like a rip off of several other movies.Both Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette offer some of their most derivative and unimpressive acting in this film. The rest of the all-star cast doesn't help either, as the script doesn't give any of them good material to work with. In fact, every character feels like a 12-year-old's fantasy of an action/crime movie character.In 1993, True Romance was an interesting film, with an edgy flare, but it needs to go back to 1993 because in 2023, it just doesn't hold up.",3.0,Anonymous,Romance

A Geek and a Call Girl Meet in a Movie Theatre Watching Kung-Fu...,"""True Romance"" is an intentionally ironic title for a film so soaked in blood. Christian Slater plays Clarence, a film geek who instantly falls in love and marries a call girl, Alabama (Patricia Arquette). The set-up, while intriguing, is so entirely unbelievable that it becomes hard to invest in the fate of these characters. Clarence, visited by the spirit of Elvis, decides he must save Alabama from the life of a call girl and confronts his pimp (Gary Oldman, in quite a bit of makeup). Believing he is her savior, Clarence demands Alabama be set free. Violence ensues. Clarence accidentally ends up with a suitcase of cocaine, which drives the plot of the movie.While the movie is filled with many well-known names, some are underused, and many characters are left undeveloped. Aside from a fantastic scene with Christopher Walken and Dennis Hopper, the rest is mediocre. Yes, there is signature Tarantino violence (directed by Tony Scott), but here, the resulting chaos seems too contrived to actually be a true romance.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

"Whilst 'True Romance' has the trappings of a Tarantino film, it lacks cohesion and substance.","'True Romance' is instantly recognisable as a Tarantino film, although it is directed by Tony Scott, with the writing credits attributed to Tarantino. The cast is promising, and the opening credits intrigued me with the promise of performances by Dennis Hopper, Brad Pitt, Christopher Walken, James Gandolfini and a host of other acclaimed actors. The lead roles are played by Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette, as a couple of cinema-goers who stumble upon one another and inadvertently fall in love. The plot soon acquires an action- thriller narrative as drugs, pimps and gangsters infringe on the couple's peace. Arquette handles her role well and plays some scenes excellently, but I'm not so sure about the casting of Slater: I think there was substantially better talent on-hand for 'True Romance', and I have to say that I didn't enjoy Slater's performance very much at all. One of the most talked about scenes of Scott's film seems to be the one between Dennis Hopper and Christopher Walken, perhaps the two most distinguished actors in the film (at this point). The scene is certainly decent, but doesn't really seem integral to the wider story. Many of the other scenes take a very Tarantino-esque approach: heated arguments are made between characters, followed by a bloody shootout. I think that this is milked somewhat in 'True Romance', and I thought that a lot more restraint could have been shown. The whole film seems like a proto-'Pulp Fiction', but with less interesting characters and developments. I also noticed that by the 45-minute mark, every character in Scott's film annoyed me for a different reason. The whole production is as inexplicable as 'No Country for Old Men' and as desperate as '25th Hour', but lacks the strong characters and narratives that defined both of these superior drugs-themed films.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

"ROMANCE, ACTION, HUMOUR AND CRIME THRILLER ALL ROLLED INTO ONE","I don't think I've ever seen a movie where the performances from every actor right down to those who only have a few lines of dialogue is pitch perfect, Patricia Arquette, Christian Slater, Brad Pitt, Gary Oldman, Christopher Walken, James Gandolfini, Michael Rapaport literally everyone in this movie smashes their characters to a tee. Brad Pitt absolutely steals the show in such a small role.I really love the score by Hans Zimmer that perfect xylophone beat is perfect for Alabama and Clarence's love story.Both our main characters have the most amazing chemistry of any love story I've seen the doe eyed innocence of Alabama and the over-protective nature of Clarence is on screen magic. And one other thing that I think makes the films so great is that movies play a really big role in these characters lives on a whole. And I think as a film fan when your characters appreciate other films and talk passionately about them it makes you even more invested in them. Whether it's the movies Floyd watches on TV or the Kung Fu movies that Alabama and Clarence love or big time movie producer Lee Donowitz. Films are an integral part to the story and characters, I really love that about this film. Just people who love movies, making movies.The scene where Clarence's dad is trying to provoke a riled up Christopher Walken is excellent and tension filled. Even though the use of slurs is dated I do believe it's to purposefully provoke a prejudiced Vincenzo. I also love how as soon as he asks for a cigarette that tells the audience exactly what is about to happen to his character. He's happy to die for his son and he's happy to die hear and now, he accepts it but he doesn't go quietly.The use of Val Kilmer as Elvis in Clarence's mind is excellent and speaks to his characters personality very much.This film is a hilarious action packed romance movie that should be on everyone's list.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

Good Film with Homage to 70s Cinema,"Just saw this film for the first time after having heard it about it repeatedly for years. I really enjoyed more than anything the great performances from a really amazing ensemble cast. The fast and clever language often found in Tarantino movies is heard all throughout this film. The plot and story often feel predictable and the unfolding of events lead to a conclusion that is relatively obvious from halfway into the film. I didn't find myself captivated by the story but I was invested in the smart directing and writing in several of the individual scenes. Multiple scenes in the film stand out with the Tarantino dialogue and interesting direction from Tony Scott including the showdown at Drexel's and the interrogation scene between Christopher Walken and Dennis Hopper. The closer the ending came the less the film seemed to engage me. Despite the story not entirely working for me, I really enjoyed many of the individual scenes. It is clear from the story and style of the film that there is an influence of 70s cinema with films like Terrence Malick's Badlands, referenced throughout the movie. If Howard Hawks was right and all you need to have a good film is ""three great scenes and no bad scenes"" than this film is definitely worth checking out.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Clumsy, scattershot and mostly devoid of any real substance, True Romance is a flash in the pan thriller with bits-and-pieces going for it.","Nothing in True Romance is especially mature, but that doesn't stop it from being quite the little blast of cine-literate pulp nonsense. Some of it's funny, some of it's actually quite disturbing; most of it has a lot to do with drugs and pimps, and lowlifes killing other lowlifes to an omnipresent rock-'em-sock-'em aesthetic; it's put together in this manner that has it creep along the line of what's acceptable and what isn't, but it works in the long run if for the time you're sitting there watching it. To state that it's one of the best films a certain Tony Scott ever made speaks volumes; to say the likes of those such as Brad Pitt went on to play roles much more interesting in films that were a lot better speaks even greater volumes. Most of the film is good value; very little of it is especially grown-up; it's tone and content, which will sway wildly from stoner comedy to one of the two leads receiving a beating from a mobster in a nasty little scene, just about holds together with this dumb, infectious energy constantly ticking it over in the engine room.Christian Slater plays Clarence Worley, a store clerk in his twenties; a sensitive and kind, although schizophrenic, man who craves a female presence in his life and talks with great enthusiasm about things that are dear to him, namely comic books; Elvis Presley tracks and import kung-fu films of the 1970s. When I think of a ""Clarence"", I think of a deliberately dorky looking character in a Gary Larson sketch. He sits at a bar, during the opening scene, and talks to a sex worker about these things, but he's out of his depth - as if he's too nice-a guy to be in this zone speaking to this calibre of person, but so starved of anything remotely of Clarence's ilk is the zone within which he's based, that he must resort to such places and people. She is disinterested, but then again of course she is.Cut to an establishing shot of where we are: a grim looking Detroit with a grey cloud over it and a generally gloomy atmosphere. Fate appears to deliver an amiable blow when another young sex worker, Patricia Arquette's Alabama, enters the cinema within which Clarence is watching a kung-fu film and sits next to him. They bond, appear to get along and before True Romance's second act can even stretch its legs in preparation to enter the fray, they are married. Clarence is happy he's quashed his desire for someone female and with the apparent interest in what he likes and Alabama's search for some sort of consistency in this, her trek up from far and away Florida, has led her to young Clarence.Where Slater's character lived for the adventure in his movies, and could only feel passion and love for certain comic books in that he's very protective of certain rare varieties of them, he is now able to direct unto Alabama this enthusiasm to keep something that needs protecting as pristine as possible as well as experience the adventure and dangers abound in his films and comic books. This is born out of what lies within the threatening circles within which Alabama operated prior to knowing Clarence: specifically, her pimp Drexl (Oldman) and the fact he takes issue with this newly formed matrimony. The point of no return is crossed; this first barrier the ""new"" Clarence must hurdle if he is to live out his fantasies and maintain what it is he's found after years of searching accomplished in his killing of Drexl. Once carried out, the pair of them head for Los Angeles out of the fact somewhat skewered twist of fate that saw Clarence grab a case of cocaine upon leaving Drexl's abode, with the mobsters (the true owners of the drugs) out looking for it too.It's no secret the film loses a lot of its energy and verve upon its arrival in California; primarily out of the fact they get there too quickly and the early poking around under this cloud of gloom and apparent despair as a young guy and a young girl fall in love and try to work around this psychotic pimp is quite good. I've never been fond of crime films set in sunny, bright nor indeed welcoming locales, but what's lacking here is much for Clarence and Alabama to actually get up to. We do not, to the film's ultimate detriment, have the leads' journey to L.A. depicted; a passage of time rife with the potential for dramatic ingredients and the opportunity for a stone-wall antagonist to establish themselves so that it might provide these two leads something to do. There is the potential for this sort of material, in that Christopher Walken plays the boss of a group of these mobsters looking for their cocaine, whose verbal standoff with Clarence's father as he strives to find where they've gone calls to mind the best of what True Romance writer Tarantino can do: think the opening scene of Inglourious Basterds or the final scenes of Pulp Fiction. Alas, he disappears after this one sequence. Credit must go to Christian Slater, who does well in his depiction of someone going from being this weak clerk to a hardened guy having to punch well above his weight, but the film lacks any sort of backbone. Its persistency to use Malick's overture from Badlands serves only to remind us how good that film was, whereas with hindsight, one is able to point out how Tarantino forged an early forte out of depicting partnerships, or couples, dodging bullets and doing crime as apparent in Natural Born Killers; From Dusk 'til Dawn or strands of Pulp Fiction. This is the lesser of the four, and not particularly brilliant as a standalone film either.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

Redeemed by the brilliance of Tarantino's dialogue.,"Quentin Tarantino wrote ""True Romance"", with some help from an uncredited Roger Avary, but Tony Scott was the director which might account for why, at times, it's a sickeningly violent, exploitative mess of a movie redeemed by the brilliance of Tarantino's dialogue and its terrific cast.Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette are the young lovers on the lam with $500,000 worth of cocaine stolen from the Mob while Christopher Walken, brilliant as always in his one-scene cameo, and James Gandolfini are among those on their trail.

This will be remembered as one of Tarantino's best...,"This one is Tarantino's wish-fulfilment movie (even though Tony Scott directed), written when he was still an unknown video store clerk, so we have a largely friendless comic-store clerk named Clarence (Christian Slater) winning over novice hooker Alabama (an impossibly cute and sexy Patricia Arquette) with his guileless charm and then putting one over on all manner of bad guys.This is a good film. Everything Tarantino touched pre-1997 was fresh and new and entertaining, and back then he was only filling his films with references to his favourite movies instead of ripping them off under the guise of paying homage. Here, the film fairly bulges with these references, from movies playing on TVs in the background to posters on toilet walls to the wallpaper in the runaway couples' motel room and the Badlands-style voice-over and music. The dialogue isn't as hip as it would be in Dogs and Fiction, but it's still good and there are some stand-out scenes  two of which involve interrogations in which the person being interrogated turns the tables on their persecutor in different but equally effective ways.The other thing that should be touched upon is the quality of the cast. This one really is a one-off: Slater, Arquette, Oldman, Walken, Hopper, Jackson, Gandolfini, Pitt, Kilmer  it reads like a list of who is, was, or is going to be. No doubt Tarantino can still assemble such a starry line-up, but whether he will ever again be able to fashion such a spirited, entertaining and unpretentious piece of work is open to question.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

Tony Scott should have stuck to directing Military/espionage movies (i.e Crimson Tide and Enemy of the State). Christian Slater does his best to be convincing as the Love addicted Clarence but will only disappoint the viewer. Arquette is on babe duty and i think that draws attention away from the fact that she is a bad actress.I think what makes this movie interesting is that we get to see big movie star's before they became famous (i.e. Pitt, Gandolfini, Slater, Kilmer).All in all the script is pure QT, but with Slater and Arquette in the lead roles and with the guidance of Tony Scott, Tarantino might as well disown the movie.",4.0,Anonymous,Romance

"Patricia Arquette, Kelly Bundy... and The Persuader, the British school of direction","The British school of direction. I suppose few of you out there go for Director's Commentaries, so few of you would know about The Persuader employed by Tony Scott. Before I continue, the man is dead, I'm hesitant to throw stones at somebody who is no longer with us, but I only found that out a little while ago. But as for what Tony fondly refers to as the British school of direction, smacking his leading lady through the face to get her to sufficiently emote for two scenes in this movie (the romantic 'billboard' scene where Clarence finds her softly weeping outside on the roof, and the one where she thinks Clarence is dead)... Isn't it just too damn much that the movie that is notorious for its violence against women (the James Ganfolfini Virgil beating up Alabama scene is surely the cinematographic zenith of just exactly this, and IF THERE IS SOMETHING OUTDOING THIS, KINDLY DON'T BRING IT TO MY ATTENTION, I DON'T WANT TO SEE IT) had a director that slapped an (in basically his own words) innocent kid with a child-like quality through the face? To get her all teary- eyed after a grueling shooting schedule when she wasn't able to project herself as the script required... Believe me, I do understand. I just find it absolutely appalling. Hell, is this what they did on PARTY OF FIVE? Imagine if that was what they did on weepy old PARTY OT FIVE!As for the movie, I find it overrated. Everybody's so damn pleased, it is such a beloved classic. To me it seems that as long as you satisfy people's need for on-screen violence (which this one does in spades!), it is just hunky-dory, everybody is so peachy- keen on it, nobody's complaining, the reviews are favorable EVEN THOUGH THE EFFING THING FAILS TO MAKE ANY EFFING SENSE! I could point out that I find obnoxious Virgil's comment re the first time you kill, how difficult that is, to be what-I-accept-to-be the truth. Yet killing doesn't affect Clarence, he takes to it like a duck to water, he is therefore a natural born killer (ha! No pun intended) yet he is supposed to be a sweet comic book store Average Joe, Oh For Crying Out Loud I Rest My Case, I won't go on this any further (my tea is getting cold), the script is torn between a madman genius's schizophrenic bipolar conflicted mind's disparate working.From the start, especially there in the movie theater, Patricia reminded me of Christina Applegate (Kelly Bundy in MARRIED WITH CHILDREN) and I'm pretty sure the two are interchangeable :)",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

There are some world class actors in this movie and it's entertaining.A man who works at a comic book store goes out for his birthday meeting an interesting lady, he ends up stealing cocaine from his new wife's pimp and tries to sell it in Hollywood, prompting the mobsters who own the drugs to pursue the couple.A love story full of violence and chaos, a real Romeo and Juliet. The story was decent and the action was good with some great scenes, the motel scene and the Finale in particular are ones to remember!!! Not a fan of the score it sounded as if I was watching the little mermaid, very out of sorts. Overall good movie !!! 7.5/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

Underrated Classic.,"I would say very few films have it all, and ""True Romance"" is one of them. There are so many beautifully crafted elements to this riveting motion picture I don't know where to start. Tarantino's merciless violence pleasantly blended with a romanticly witty touch displayed through the stellar performances of Christian Slater(Clarence) and Patricia Arquette(Alabama) was something to behold. And the music scene was absolutely perfect from start to finish. True Romance honestly might be one of Tarantino's masterpieces simply because he didn't direct it. Quentin Tarantino and Tony Scott's combined ingenuity made for quite the ride. This is one of the most rewatchable motion pictures ever.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
A Masterpiece,"I've never been the biggest Terantino fan (only when I have a hankering for senseless violence), but after seeing True Romance, I now know the real Quentin Terantino...the writer! Never have I seen more clever of a screenplay! And never such wonderful unity in acting! I picked to watch this film on Valentines Day because I'm single and didn't want something too mushy, and I must say that was the best movie decision I've made since as far as I can remember. True Romance is just that. Authentic. Genuine. Real. Terantino and director Tony Scott have intertwined romance and blood in a beautifully harmonious action thriller in which every character is distinctively defined. It didn't require one of the best movie endings I have ever witnessed to make me love this film, but it included it anyway. Bravo! 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
a misfire,"It's too bad about 'True Romance.'  Judging from the screenplay, this could have been a fine film.  That is, with a different director.  Tony Scott is responsible for the mess that is 'True Romance.'  He clearly can't do subtlety.  He doesn't know when to tone it down. He doesn't know what's funny about the screenplay.  He plays every moment huge and overblown.  A stylistic choice, you say?  Please.  Take a look at Tony Scott's credits.  'The Last Boyscout', 'The Fan,' 'Beverly Hills Cop II.'  Did he mean to make these films the overwrought bores that they were?  That's all he knows how to do.  It's really a shame that his brother didn't direct 'True Romance.'",,Anonymous,Romance
3rd favorite movie ever! Proud of this too - this is my 200th review.,"Pure genuine wonderful action romance better than any chick flick in my opinion! Technically Quentin Tarantino's first, since he wrote it which is impressive cause it's well written with heart and a joyful soundtrack that makes me smile. Packed in with an all star cast that's fun to watch.
Important to note there's some very violent scenes that were done to perfection despite the subject matter, especially the scene with Drexel (Gary Oldman) that is the bees nees of awesomeness among other flawless parts like the dark part with the psychotic character of a henchman (James Gandolfini) that's always intense.Clarence's (Christian Slater) early charismatic charm is always a delight throughout to watch in this too and most anything else I've seen. I'll also mention in case anyone's wondering, my first 2 favorites are Fight Club and The Matrix. Also (Tony Scott) has done many excellent films, unfortunately he's gone now. Sorry I got off subject a little; I'm quirky and wanted to mention a few things.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Not your average 'romance' movie...,"True Romance (1993/Tony Scott) {written by Quentin Tarantino} *** out of ****I recently purchased a boat load of Tarantino flicks, and this was one of them. Sure it wasn't directed by him, but their are still many of his trademarks (hamburgers and kung-fu films) featured in the film.I want to start out by saying that this film has the finest cast I have ever seen on film. It starts out as the strangest Romance I have ever seen, but quickly changes gears into a violent/action/thriller. The films starts out with a nerdy Elvis fan in Detroit named Clarence(Christian Slater) who has a one night stand with a call girl named Alabama (the very sexy Patricia Arquette). They soon decide that they love each other and get married. Then, Clarence takes it upon himself to kill Alabama's old Pimp (Gary Oldman in dreadlocks ). This is were the ultra bloody/violent fun begins, when they take it on the lam.Other players in the cast are Dennis Hopper (Clarence's father), Christopher Walken (a ruthless mobster), Brad Pitt (the ultimate stoner), Val Kilmer (Clarence's vision of Elvis), Chris Penn & Tom Sizemore (two cops), James Gandolfini (a cold-blooded hitman), and Samuel L. Jackson as a Drug-dealer (very small part). The only problem I have with the cast is that a lot of the characters either are killed off or disappear before they can develop fully. The best scene is when Walken interrogates Hopper's character. It is surreal to see such great actors in the same scene. Excellent dialogue too. I also found it strange to see Hopper in such a toned down role.Some die-hard Tarantino fans might not like the fact that it is not directed by Tarantino, but that isn't really a problem. Tony Scott ('Enemy of the State' and 'Spy Game') does a credible job directing, if not a little fast paced. But the film has that ""we've seen it all before"" feeling, especially with the blood soaked climax.All in all, a worthy effort. A must for Tarantino fans, but others rent before purchase. The DVD is excellent, and a great addition to my collection.-30-",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
"The best movie, ever","Well, this is my favorite movie of all time, and the best movie I've ever seen. I'm kind of undecided on Tarantino's projects. I liked Kill Bill one and two, hated Pulp Fiction, hated Resovoir Dogs even worse. This movie did not use Tarantino's original ending. There is a lot of good info in the 2 disc director's cut. All I can say is if you've never seen this movie, you're cheating yourself. I've had people reluctant to watch it because it sounds like it's a ""chick flick."" It is anything but. It is a smart, action love story. A unique and one of a kind film. I promise this film will not leave you disappointed, but completely satisfied. Which is all a good movie can do. And when it comes to an all star cast! O M G! There will never be this many A list stars in a movie again. Some of the biggest only have cameos, which I love. (think Val Kilmer and Samuel Jackson.) Watch it as released then check out the alternate ending, I think you'll agree this movie was cast perfectly (like 8MM) written and directed perfectly, and even edited well. (think Indiana Jones or the original Star Wars trilogy editing) Every scene moves the story forward. I never felt like I was missing information or watching filler. I've gushed enough. I love it, you probably will too. Go watch it!",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Very pulpy... perhaps too pulpy for my tastes,"I'm not sure what would have made this film more appealing to me... maybe Tarantino should have directed it... maybe someone other than Christian Slater should have played the lead role... maybe there should have been fewer deaths... maybe the film should have been shorter. As is, the film just didn't interest me all that much, and I only really paid attention to the first few and the last few scenes. The plot never really got my interest, though I thought the love story between the two leads was surprisingly good. The pacing seems much too slow and jolted for a Tarantino film(honestly, either Tarantino should have been allowed to direct it or Scott should have written his own script). The acting ranges, but most of it is good. Slater is acceptable, but a good actor he is not. His performance is passable at best, and him being the leading man definitely took a lot out of the experience for me. The film never really seemed to take off or go anywhere... and not long into the movie, it was just waiting for the next guy to get killed. The dialog is typical Tarantino, meaning somewhat roundabout, but usually funny and/or insightful. The humor is pretty good, and also fairly typical Tarantino(though it too would have benefited from Tarantino directing the film). To make it perfectly clear; the film is clearly and obviously and in many, many ways a Tarantino film. His unique and easily recognizable style is here, just like in Reservoir Dogs, both volumes of Kill Bill, Pulp Fiction and Jackie Brown. However, this is, by definition, not a Tarantino film. He didn't direct it, and believe me, it shows. Scott just doesn't ""get"" Tarantino's style, and messes up so many of his trademarks(most notably, he removes the important non-linear time-line) and references, stuff that Tarantino never would have blown, not in a million years(here I feel it is necessary to point out that I am not a fan of Tarantino's). Yes, that's what really brings this film down; another director trying to shoot a story that Tarantino has put together, and who completely misses the boat. Just for the record, an example of a director's perfect use of a Tarantino script is the Robert Rodriguez/Quentin Tarantino collaboration From Dusk Till Dawn. Go see that one before even thinking about this one. I recommend this film to Tarantino/pulp fans. Give it a chance. Just don't expect a Tarantino film. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
"True, Hollow, Poorly-written Romance","True Romance...where to start.I did NOT like this movie. After about an hour and a half, my interest waned and I turned back to writing up my chemistry lab report.Straightaway, I disliked the dialogue when Slater was talking about Elvis to the girl in the bar...for several minutes. And it continued to turn me off: the lines were too stylized, expected, and long winded, with little fluff/point to them. And they were often incredibly vulgar. I can handle swearing no problem, but the sheer amount of f-bombs and vulgarity was entirely unneeded.However vulgar the lines, a stellar performance by the actors can make it tolerable...I mean, Boondock Saint's was an incredible movie! But Boondock Saints also had incredible acting. Not a single one of the characters in True Romance held any sway over my emotions. I felt zero empathy; who cares if Alabama gets the crap beat out of her? Who cares if Slater gets shot in the head? Not me. The actors just did not seem to exude any feeling while delivering their lines, leaving me in a state of complete boredom and apathy.The storyline wasn't too bad, though it seemed a bit forced along and strung together by the aforementioned bad acting and weak dialogue. I think the only thing that provoked me to rate this with a 3 is the cinematography. The fight scenes, explosions etc, were excellent, touched with Tarantino's talent of creating that funky mood through the use of cameras that we love so very much.I would not, however, recommend this to anyone. No matter how pretty it looks. 3/10 is the best this can get.",3.0,Anonymous,Romance

"Full blown Quentin Tarantino flick. ""So cool, so cool, so cool"".","True Romance was released after Reservoir Dogs but before Pulp Fiction. Reservoir Dogs was a worldwide critically acclaimed debut, but True Romance was written by Quentin Tarantino way before Reservoir Dogs was made. Therefore it is logical to assume that the real debut of Tarantino was actually True Romance, Tarantino's first motion picture, as a screenwriter.With this cool script Tarantino molded True Romance into a brilliant gangster movie like only he can make them. Yes, we gotta pay some dues to the director Tony Scott as well, but to be honest, this is a full blown Tarantino flick: ""so cool, so cool, so cool"".Every characteristic later to be found in all Tarantino classics can already be found in the script of True Romance: the referals to other movie classics, the obnoxious violence and most of all lots of brilliant true to life dialogue. Tarantino is a known addict of talkshows and I love Tarantino's work foremost for his ever brilliant dialogues.The acting is brilliant too, with an incredible big cast of now household names that perform as supporting actors. Choose your pick: roles by a young Brad Pitt, and a young Samuel L Jackson. The always to be feared Dennis Hopper, Christopher Walken, Gary Oldman and James Gandolfini who all play crucial and shocking supporting roles. Christian Slater's best role in his entire carreer, and Patricia Arquette has never shone as brightly as she did in True Romance. This movie is an actor's heaven. Just incredible, you wont find any movie today with such a star cast.Everything is over the top in this movie. It bursts with energy! And almost everything is full blown big. The soundtrack is subtle, gorgeous yet very powerful. The photograpy is over the top, but still very mesmirizing. The speed of this thing just won't stop. Even the scenes with just dialogues are performed on steroids. Everthing is big, fast and cool about True Romance! This picture shows Tarantino bursting to life with his first script. I think it is as great as his other classics. What a joy to watch over and over again. Just brilliant!",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Outlaw cinema masterpiece with A-list cred,"I find Tony Scott's films hit-and-miss. I've liked all the Tarantino films Tarantino has scripted and directed, and I like ""Natural Born Killers"" a lot, a film he wrote but didn't direct. Originally, Bill Lustig was set to direct ""True Romance"", but Scott ended up with the project. The result? Cinematic dynamite! This is outlaw cinema with an A-list cast and budget. It is an intense, compelling, adrenalin-pumped masterpiece that is one of the most re-watchable films in my collection. There are so many great sequences and the characters, thanks to Quentin's sharp, inventive screenplay, are all distinctive and memorable. Christian Slater's ""cute meet"" with Patricia Arquette, in a cinema screening Chiba's ""The Streetfighter"", is just fantastic. Slater's across-the-bar conversation where he admits that he'd f**k Elvis is hilarious and perversely understandable. Gary Oldman's intro scene where he and his pals steal a case of cocaine and chat about eating a woman's p***y and a** is pure grindhouse. Dennis Hopper's big dramatic scene with Chris Walken is a knockout, as are all of Saul Rubinek's scenes. Val Kilmer is a great Elvis and James Gandolfino, as the humble baddie who beats Arquette senseless in one of the film's most vicious scenes, is give-the-man-an-Oscar great. Of course, cinematic masterpieces like ""True Romance"" don't get Oscars. Because all the elements gel so beautifully, why exactly TR works so well is not plain to see. It just does. It's high gloss ex-, blax- and sexploitation all stirred into one steaming cauldron of gunfire, bloodshed, sexy sleaze, hilarity, and the naive, glorious idealism of youth. It has a devil-may-care nihilism about it and an energy level that is rare for a film sent through the Hollywod machine to mainstream distribution. Not surprisingly, it didn't do great box office, but it's done good business on DVD and been rediscovered. Scott, when saddled with good screenplays, like ""Man on Fire"", ""Revenge"" and ""Spy Game"", is more than capable of delivering first class entertainment. When he's staring into the face of crap like ""Domino"", he camouflages the manure with bloated stylization. ""True Romance"" is his best film, and one of the best films ever produced in Hollywood. Oh, I almost forgot, Brad Pitt's ""Floyd"" character is simply, well, untouchable.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

"The Tarantino Pentathlon Part 3 - By his hand, but not through his eyes: True Romance","It all depends on your definition of RomanceAfter the surprise success of Reservoir Dogs, Quentin Tarantino managed to get another of his writing efforts made into a film and the result, which is called True Romance, features quite a lot of blood, profanity and some strange dialog. True Romance is basically a romantic thriller and by that I mean romantic in the really broad sense, because for most people romantic is when you have a candle lit dinner under the stars. The main characters in this film though, Clarence (Christian Slater) and Alabama (Patricia Arquette), do not do that sort of stuff and I must say that, although I understand their feelings for each other, they really have a screwed up definition of the word romance.The thrilling element of the film comes from the fact, that almost throughout the entire film, Clarence and Alabama are hunted by a bunch gangsters who want to kill them. Now Clarence and Alabama are no angels, but when they are not in the criminal circle both of them are very open and pretty cool, so not matter what happens, you start to like them and feel for them. This enables the film to maintain a pretty high level of thrill throughout, except for the scenes where nothing of that tension shines through and it is as if Clarence and Alabama have a life without worries and this is what gives True Romance a weird, yet original touch. I do not know if this touch made the film worse than it could have been, but I certainly cannot imagine the film without it.There are some similarities between True Romance and Reservoir Dogs. First of all, the events in True Romance also happen in a criminal milieu. Second of all, there is quite a lot of profanity and blood. And third of all, there is (as in Reservoir Dogs) some strange dialog, which I think only Tarantino could have produced. I mean everybody who has seen Reservoir Dogs remembers a couple of crazy dialogs from that film, like the scene in which all of the guys are talking about the meaning of the song Like a Virgin' or the scene in which the nick-names' are given to the gangsters. True Romance features a couple of dialogs like that also, for instance right in the beginning, when Clarence talks about Elvis to some blond in a bar or when Clarence's dad (Dennis Hopper) tells some gangster from Sicily, where his ancestors come from. I enjoyed those dialogs and I think together with the ending monologue by Alabama, those are probably the best lines in the film.Overall, this is not a bad film, but it seems to lack that extra something. I feel, that the viewer is not sucked into the story enough and I also feel, there are some scenes which need some work, for they feel awkward or are unnecessary bloody and / or emotional. Those scenes include the interrogation scene with Dennis Hopper, the last scene with James Gandolfini and the last scene with Chris Penn. Don't get me wrong, this is by all means a good effort, but it is not good. Maybe Tarantino should be the only one allowed to direct Tarantino stories.7 out of 10",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

One of my favorite movies of all time!!,"I made a boo-boo when I voted. I gave it a 10 but something must have slipped because my vote registered as a 6.This film came out 3 years before Pulp Fiction, before Tarentino made his big splash with Pulp Fiction. Maybe that is part of why this film was not marketed in the manner it deserved. I'm always amazed at the number of film fans I know who have never even heard of it! Tarentino did not direct this, but he wrote it.It has almost as much (or as much) violence as Pulp Fiction, so if you hate Pulp Fiction maybe you wouldn't like this film either -- but otherwise it's AWESOME...! Gary Oldman, Dennis Hopper, Christopher Walken, Patricia Arquette, Christian Slater and many others in this star-studded cast were excellent in their roles. This is most of all a FUN movie to watch.

A great early Tarantino script,"For many years I was an avid Tarantino fan however I had no clue as to the existence of the movie True Romance until it was introduced by a friend. I was immediately captivated by the movie from the opening scenes.The dialogue in this movie as with all Tarantino dialogue in my opinion is top notch. The use of normal daily dialogue to spice up a very interesting plot does wonders in this film. And as with most good dialogue if it is not delivered well it is useless.Which brings me to the all-star cast that is featured in this film. Many extremely unforgettable scenes were present in this film in particular the Hopper/Walken scene which provides humor, history, and a heck of a lot of drama. The Gandolfini/Arquette scene was perhaps the most intense sequence ever put on film. And of course Slater/Oldman have a very amazing scene with great dialogue and a lot of action. And who can forget the minor yet very inspiring characters of Brad Pitt, Michael Rapaport, Saul Rubinek and of course Val Kilmer as 'The King.'

A Cinematic Love Letter to Chaos and Passion,"""True Romance"" is a 1993 film that deftly marries the raw energy of Quentin Tarantino's writing with Tony Scott's slick directorial style, resulting in a cult classic that still resonates today. This film, anchored by standout performances from Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette, is a thrilling ride through the underbelly of America, where love and violence intermingle in a way that only Tarantino could envision. The plot follows Clarence Worley (Slater), an Elvis Presley fanatic and comic book store clerk, who falls head over heels for Alabama Whitman (Arquette), a quirky and vivacious call girl. Their whirlwind romance leads to a spontaneous marriage, but their happiness is quickly threatened when Clarence inadvertently steals a suitcase full of cocaine from Alabama's dangerous pimp, Drexl Spivey (Gary Oldman in a chilling performance). From here, ""True Romance"" embarks on a frenetic journey as the couple attempts to sell the drugs and start a new life together. The film's narrative is propelled by a series of intense and often violent encounters with a colorful array of characters, from a benevolent movie producer (Saul Rubinek) to a menacing mob enforcer (Christopher Walken). Each interaction is laced with Tarantino's signature sharp dialogue and dark humor, making every scene memorable. What sets ""True Romance"" apart is its ability to balance its chaotic elements with genuine emotion. Clarence and Alabama's love story is the heart of the film, and their chemistry is palpable. Slater and Arquette deliver performances that are both tender and ferocious, embodying the desperation and passion of two people who have found a once-in-a-lifetime connection amidst the turmoil. Their relationship feels real and raw, providing an emotional anchor that grounds the film's more outlandish moments. The supporting cast is equally impressive, with standout performances from a host of now-iconic actors. Gary Oldman's portrayal of Drexl Spivey is a masterclass in villainy, combining unpredictability with a sinister charm. Dennis Hopper and Christopher Walken share a tense and unforgettable scene that showcases their acting prowess, while Brad Pitt's brief turn as a stoner roommate adds a touch of levity to the proceedings. Visually, Tony Scott brings a vibrant, almost hyper-real quality to the film. The use of bold colors and dynamic camera work enhances the story's frenetic energy, while Hans Zimmer's score, particularly the hauntingly beautiful ""You're So Cool"" theme, adds an extra layer of emotional depth. However, ""True Romance"" is not without its flaws. The film's relentless pace and frequent shifts in tone can be jarring, and some viewers may find the level of violence off-putting. Additionally, while Tarantino's dialogue is undoubtedly sharp and engaging, it occasionally veers into self-indulgence, risking the immersion of the audience. Despite these minor quibbles, ""True Romance"" remains a powerful and exhilarating film. It's a testament to the talents of everyone involved, from Scott's stylish direction to Tarantino's bold screenplay, and the exceptional performances of the cast. The film captures a sense of reckless abandon and unfiltered emotion that is rarely seen in contemporary cinema. In conclusion, ""True Romance"" is a rollercoaster of a film that combines high-octane action, dark humor, and heartfelt romance into a unique and unforgettable experience. It's a love letter to those who live on the edge, and to the chaotic beauty that can arise from life's most unexpected moments. Whether you're a fan of Tarantino's razor-sharp writing or Scott's visual flair, ""True Romance"" offers something for everyone. It's a film that demands to be seen, remembered, and cherished, a true gem in the annals of 1990s cinema.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

First Viewing 2009,"This 5-star movie rated 7.9 on the IMDb scale. I never viewed this movie until 2009 because I was stuck in Saudi Arabia in 93. I never heard of it until I browsed Tony Scott and saw its rating. In summary, this movie was filmed ahead of it time. It's a 'wild' and 'free' loving movie and a part of pop culture. I fell in love with Clarence and Alabama and their magical attraction to each other. Very few movies with a cast of pop stars turns into a masterpiece. This movie is Tony Scott's 'magnum opus' or greatest work. I purchased a director's cut copy. Tarantino wrote a pop culture classic. Scott directed a love story like no other. Slater, a comic book salesman and movie enthusiast, played the part of a delusional 'King of pop'. Arquette, loyal hot pants, to pimp and then husband was alluring. Hopper was Hopper, a trustworthy father who passed his freedom loving genes to his son Clarence. Kilmer played Elvis in voice as the 'King of Pop' to a mentor driven Clarence. Walken has never been better as he played a Sicilian mobster after his cocaine deal went bad. Oldman played Oldman as the pimp, drug pusher, pirate of Detroit. Pitt played a minor part made major by his drug habits. Without major credit, James Gandolfini played Tony Saprano in the making. I'm sure his unbelievable performance led to him being selected for the HBO series ""The Sopranos."" In a nutshell, this sick movie was fantastic and alluring.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

I love this movie but,"Hans Zimmer's score is awful. Like the worst work of his career. It's generic, early 90s, pg-comedy bad.

character acting just steal the show,"It was a fun romantic movie with some really hardcore violence once in a while and a true Tarantino piece with the dialogue.It was a nice little Love Story and I could really feel the love between the characters and I could truly see that he was a kind of nerdy trip kind of guy from the 90s. I can totally get why one of my friends fell in love with this movie when he was 20.But the character acting just steal the show all these talented actors playing kooky characters is just so much fun and Tarantino dialogue makes it so that you cannot look away if you're not into Tarantino dialogue, then you are not gonna have fun because some of the monologues are really long.The story feels like some self-insert movie Guy stuff and I respected and love it. It's just so fun seeing people put themselves in this story. We I mean I can totally see myself in the main character when he's dreaming about his sexy woman get into his life and he's just a comic book guy I can understand why people get related to it.

"Two cups of solid action, half a pint of humour, a pound of great cast, layered with a generous dollop of True Romance.","I enjoyed this film so much, it's one of my top ten all-time favourites. Oddly enough, my top ten favourites do not include a single Tarantino-directed movie - I honestly wonder if all his writing would be this good with a competent director, like Scott, or if the uncredited Avary's influence was what made this particular movie stand out for me.The story is nothing new or original. Boy meets girl. Boy falls in love with girl. S*** happens. It's almost a traditional yarn, but so lovingly spun that it deserves to be a classic. It's not life-changing genius. It's not world-shaping art. It's never going to be the subject of a classical literature degree... but it *is* engrossing, entertaining, enjoyable, and honestly, utterly, undeniably romantic.The cast is brilliant, and expertly placed to shine in their respective roles. Almost every line is quotable and no scene is wasted. Sure, the dialogue is recognisably Tarantino, but it's just not the same winding monotony that taints the interplay in his own directing ventures - it flows well and doesn't get in the way of real acting. Exchanges between characters feel natural.Yes, it has violence (this is an action movie after all), but it serves to enhance the elements of peril that pull the viewer into the plight of our plucky couple. The most harrowing moments in this movie involve the least gun-play, deriving their impact from strong performances and believable pain or sacrifice. Despite some tried-and-true Hollywood-style action too, there is an appreciable element of reality and plausibility that makes suspension of disbelief an effortless endeavour.This movie has compelling characterisation, perfect pace, well-directed dialogue, an appropriate measure of action, and characters you can really root-for... not to mention that this cynical critic can't watch it without almost (not quite, but almost) getting all weepy.If you're a Tarantino fan and you haven't watched this, you may be neglecting his best work. If you are *not* a Tarantino fan and you haven't watched this, you may be neglecting a true classic.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"High Energy, Non-Stop Violence","True Romance (1993)*** (out of 4)High-energy romp written by Quentin Tarantino that all you need to know if that Dennis Hopper of all people plays the most normal character. Clarence (Christian Slater) marries Alabama (Patricia Arquette) after knowing each other one day and when he goes to her pimp (Gary Oldman) to get her things he ends up killing the pimp and running off with half a million in cocaine. Soon the new couple are on their way to California to try and sale it but gangsters are hot on their trail. TRUE ROMANCE, at its heart, is a love story between the couple but with Tarantino's name attached you know it's not going to be your typical romance. Instead we get a foul-mouthed, non-stop violent and at times insane action picture that starts off weird and just keeps getting nuttier as the film goes along. As I said, you know you're in for a wild time when you've got Dennis Hopper playing the most normal person. It should also be mentioned that the mad man Hopper gets a terrific scene with Christopher Walken, which is worth the price of admission. I mean, the two craziest guys of their era in a scene together? Tarantino's screenplay is full of everything people have come to love about him including the references to older movies and the dialogue itself is just so sharp and fresh that you'll have no problem connecting to these characters even when the majority of viewers would never have come into contact with their type in real life. The all-star cast is another major plus with Slater and Arquette doing a terrific job together and they really come off as a wild and crazy couple. The terrific supporting cast includes the already mentioned Hopper and Walken but there's also Val Kilmer playing Elvis, a mentor to Slater plus Brad Pitt as a pothead, Bronson Pinchot, Samuel L. Jackson, Michael Rapaport, Saul Rubinek and James Gandolfini as one of the goons. The violence in the film is pretty brutal from start to finish with the pimp really getting a workout and the ending, which features the good guys doing battle with not only drug dealers but also gangsters and the police. The incredibly violent shoot out is so unrealistic but it's so stylishly done that you have no problem turning off your brain and enjoying. Some of the violence goes a tad bit too far and especially a sequence where Arquette gets her entire body broken to a pulp. There are a few minor issues with the story including how this comic book nerd could turn into a mad man over night plus the fact that it seems like the police are always missing no matter how crazy everything in the story gets. With that said, TRUE ROMANCE isn't a masterpiece but it's still a very entertaining little gem that contains enough energy for two movies and the solid cast really makes it a must see.",,Anonymous,Romance
Odd Title,"Knowing this film was written by Tarantino, it was a no-brainer that it would be violent and rich in dialogue. It also seemed like a strange title since Tarantino has never directed a romance story, and this movie is only devoted to the titular romance at certain moments. Rather than focusing on the actual romance, this film primarily focuses on the aftermath of Clarence's decision to ""rescue"" Alabama from her pimp. What I mean by this is that the movie is driven by the fact that people are after Clarence once he steals some cocaine as well as by Clarence's sense of freedom by sitting on a fortune as long as he sells the coke. The romance is something that compliments this story.When the romance is actually given attention in the film it proves to be interesting. Clarence learns that Alabama is a prostitute who his boss had hired to show Clarence a good time on his birthday, and this makes no difference to his feelings for Alabama. She is touched that he genuinely had a good time with her - the greatest time he has had with a girl in his whole life. Sex is not the deciding factor here; Clarence loves Alabama for who she is, what she loves, her comforting presence. Perhaps this is the meaning of the title - the romance is formed regardless of the situation of how the two met. The two are together throughout the movie, but it is a shame that most of the film focuses on the crime Clarence becomes involved in rather than the dynamics of this relationship.This movie is made up of a stellar cast, and it is a shame that a good amount of recognizable names are only in the film very briefly. Though Tarantino only wrote this film we see a lot of faces found in films which he directed: Brad Pitt, Samuel L Jackson, Christopher Walken, and Chris Penn. Christian Slater as Clarence is a perfect fit for the role though he is not a well-known actor. He adds great personality to Clarence who is a true Tarantino character, defined by his taste in pop culture, as well as just a touch of craziness to make his desperation believable.Perhaps it is because this film is directed by Tony Scott and not Tarantino, but True Romance is a decent story which lacks Tarantino- level energy, especially in its action sequences. True Romance is a fun experience if you keep in mind it is a screenplay by Tarantino in his early days.3.0/4.0",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

If only QT had done it...,"Tarantino sold this script in the 80s to attempts to raise funds for the making of Reservoir Dogs. For me, this is a great shame. Tony Scott was handed the duty of trying to turn it into a great film after the success of Reservoir Dogs, but failed. Each scene is just about pieced together in the most standard possible way, and Scott brings absolutely nothing to film of any distinguishable note. The awesome cast, obviously attracted by Tarantino's script (which hard large parts edited by Scott, including a different ending), is undoubtedly a true ensemble of modern greats, and yet Scott does them no favours. He gives the film virtually no direction, and keeps everything simple and safe like many of his other films. The lead characters played by Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette, seem dazed and confused through most of the film, and do nothing to grip the audience. Slater's character, for example, makes a bizarre transformation from loner to drug dealer, without ever really drawing a line between the two.The film keeps itself moving but by no means at a excitable rate as you predict each scene before it starts. It's one saving grace however, is a truly fantastic scene between two Hollywood heavyweights - Walken and Hopper. In Chris Walken's only scene in the film, he dominates and becomes his ruthless Mob boss character. Hopper is superb as a father hiding his son's secret. Apart from this intense scene (you can cut it with a butter knife), the film has no other stand outs, and is quite disappointing and an anti-climax.... if only Quentin Tarantino could of directed it, we could of ended up with a far superior piece of film...I would still recommend it to all film fans, if not only because of the Walken/Hopper scene... if it wasn't for that, there would be no point in seeing it.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Bleeds Tarantino.,"Quentin Tarantino has long been one of, if not the, person in the film industry that I loathe the most. Despite him not directing this one, I had always avoided it just because I didn't want to deal with another one of his shallow disasters of a script. However, I figured at this point I should at least watch it for Gary Oldman's performance, since a ton of people consider it one of their favorites from him. Oldman did not disappoint. As a white pimp who tries to act black, he crafted yet another unique character in his long career, one totally removed from any other character he's ever played. He absorbs so deeply into this character and it serves as another example in the long line of roles that make him the first actor people think of when they hear the word ""chameleon"".Unfortunately he's only in it for about ten minutes and then I had to deal with the rest of this awful mess, which is pretty much everything I hate in a Tarantino screenplay. If you're not going to do anything new then you should at least do the old things in an interesting way, but that sure isn't the case here. The whole thing is a pathetically thin old-as-bones story with Tarantino's trademark dialogue that so many people eat up but I find to be disastrously artificial and awkward. No actors would be able to pull off the kind of absurd, unrealistic dialogue that he feeds them here, but a lot of the cast here feels like they aren't even trying to make it seem anything but awful.Some of the supporting players do all right in their brief screentimes, but Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette are terrible. It doesn't help that they have thin, completely one-dimensional characters (and in Arquette's case, a totally inconsistent one) but they just make matters worse with some abysmal portrayals. This one was a real chore; a completely shallow, needless exercise with some scenes that go on so long I thought I had died and fallen into hell.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance

Tarantino's Breakthrough,"Clarence (Christian Slater) marries call girl Alabama (Patricia Arquette), steals cocaine from her pimp (Gary Oldman), and tries to sell it in Hollywood, while the owners of the coke try to reclaim it.If you want to study the evolution of Quentin Tarantino, you have to start here. Plenty to take note of: the dialogue is dense, there are plenty of references to Sonny Chiba. Probably dozens of film references so obscure no viewer will ever find them.Somehow this ended up in the hands of Tony Scott. Luckily it did. Not only is he a skilled action director, but he did very little to water down the elements Tarantino put in place.

This movie is an absolute masterpiece and an underrated gem,"True Romance (1993) is a movie I recently rewatched on HBOMAX and tells the tale of a comic book shop employee whose boss sets him up with a call girl one night and they fall in love and decide to get married. The comic book shop worker seeks the call girls employer, kills him and takes a briefcase he thought was filled with her clothes but is instead filled with cocaine. The comic book shop worker and his bride decide to go to California and start a new life; however, the owner of the coke has other ideas for what should happen to their new life.This movie is directed by Tony Scott (Top Gun) and stars Christian Slater (Broken Arrow), Patricia Arquette (Stigmata), Dennis Hopper (Easy Rider), Christopher Walken (Dead Zone), Brad Pitt (Fight Club), Gary Oldman (Bram Stokers Dracula), Samuel L. Jackson (Pulp Fiction), James Gandolfini (Sopranos) and Tom Sizemore (Blackhawk Down).This is truly an all star cast of epic proportions and every character top to bottom is delivered perfectly. The circumstances and scenarios are so unique and well told and the dialogue is outstanding. The action scenes are random, intense and brilliant. The plot is well paced and keeps you glued to every second from beginning to end.

What is so great about this movie?,"Almost many people including critics (probably critics's favorite) agree that True Romance is the best Tony Scott film, a masterpiece. However, the problem is what is so great about the movie? Direction? Sorry, but we are not talking about Enemy of the State here. Acting? I don't think so, no Oscar worthy performance here. The cinematography? Nothing special. Story? A guy and a girl meet and get troubled. That's the story. This is not a great road movie or lovers on the run movie, there is nothing impressive or even artistic like Quentin Tarantino movies itself. There is not any remarkable scene to mention with enthusiasm. I don't know this adulation is because Tarantino wrote the script or not, but this is the case. It was like one of the TV movies with a dreamy cast. Years years before I bought it from a newsstand, because saw the list of the cast on the cover and saw Tony Scott. However, not only it was only a huge disappointment, but also I did not enjoy at all. Some people say look! they watch a fighting movie in the film, a reference for martial art movies. That's funny, because I love martial art movies and I would prefer to watch any martial art movie instead of watching this again. True Romance has a dreamy cast probably you will never see once again in another movie. I could not pull myself together for a long time, after had seen the cast as mentioned, but it does not save the day. By the way, honestly, I couldn't see some of them, for example I couldn't see Brad Pitt against my full attention. Thus, this is not a 'cast driven' movie at all. Tony Scott's style (I mean Tony Scott in his early days like Top Gun or Enemy of the State) is missing in this movie. True Romance is not a stylish movie, it is just ordinary in terms of direction. And as I see, especially critics don't like Top Gun, but love True Romance. True Romance recalls One Night at McCool's in the final part. That part was a little bit sloppy, but at least entertaining. Tony Scott shot such a scene? Hard to believe. Later, I exchanged the movie with another one after watching. I know that it sounds intolerable for the fans of the movie, but it sounds intolerable for me either, when reading that they watch the movie again and again with great pleasure.",3.0,Anonymous,Romance

Entertaining and problematic,"Such a fun cast, and it's never a dull moment with a Tarantino script. Even in his early films he showed the ability to include lots of interesting characters in a story with great pace and all sorts of twists, and director Tony Scott told the story well, with the only off note in production being the score, which was more suited for a tropical island than this film. However, I wasn't a big fan of the racist pseudo-intellectual pop anthropology in the ""Sicilian scene,"" and some characters, like Gary Oldman's, haven't aged very well either. The film is laden with testosterone and male fantasy which is probably to be expected and maybe part of the fun, but the big shoot out at the end was less than inspired.

There are a number of characters in this film that although they are bad at times (Gary Oldmans pimp 'Drexel' for example), you actually start to like them.The scrpit is very funny as well, although maybe a little corny at times. There are also a number of what I would say 'classic scenes. Two of them being the brutal beating of Alabama in the motel room, which shows an effective use for a toilet seat. And probeably best of all where Dennis Hopper gives his history lesson to Christopher Walkens mob leader about the origin of the Sicilian blood line, concerning a lot of bed hopping involving black people. This scene is both intense and funny, which will keep you giggling on the edge of your seat.Overall, this films deserves to be seen by anyone who likes their films funny, and very violent. try to see it in widescreen if you can, and hopefully the directors cut, which has a lot more of the violence in it.

"An weird, but enjoyable criminal drama","In general, this movie was an enjoyable criminal drama. As always I'll be telling about the good and the bad. So let's start off with the good.
I enjoyed the story. There was plenty of action in it and the dialog wasn't clunky, it flowed really well. I enjoyed the main characters. Christian Slater and his co-star were fantastic. The supporting characters were great and there were a lot of big names in there, most notably the great James Gandolfini. But inevitably there will be some bad elements.
The pacing was a bit off. I think the pacing was off because at first it was going to be directed by Tarantino. It wasn't going to be in chronological order, but when Tony Scott took over that changed. The ending was too feel good for me. Apparently there was a darker ending, which would have fit the story better imo.

Unpolished Tarantino by Scott,"This feels like a very unpolished Quentin Tarantino script, which I'm pretty sure it is. Part of an epic writing effort by Tarantino and Roger Avery while they were still working in that video store, the first half became Natural Born Killers while the second became True Romance. It has these hallmarks of a rambling script, a series of ideas sort of connected to each other but without the kind of attention to story cohesiveness that Tarantino would bring to his own directed projects. Bought by the Weinstein Brothers who hired Tony Scott to direct, it's a stylish, quasi-Tarantino jaunt through pop-culture references, gangsterism, Hollywood satire, stylish violence, and, yes, romance. Its pastiche qualities impede my enjoyment a bit, but it's still a fun ride while it lasts.Clarence (Christian Slater) is a loner, working at a comic book store who loves asking women out to Sonny Chiba triple features on dates. Alone while in such a triple feature, Alabama (Patricia Arquette), runs into him, gets him to invite her to pie afterwards, and they go back to his place where they discover that they have very quickly fallen in love. She is, of course, a call girl sent by his boss to lighten his mood on his birthday, but that doesn't diminish his love for her or her pixy-dream-girl status as the perfect girl for him. This opening half hour or so is the best of the film, focused on our two characters as they get to know each other, selling the titular romance despite Alabama's general unreality (too pretty, too well endowed, too innocent despite her profession, and too ready to fall into Clarence's preferred cinematic tastes).What follows is really a kind of staccato series of events, connected only by the fact that Clarence and Alabama are in the middle of them. That's enough for a Tony Scott film, but characters having great scenes, like Drexl (Gary Oldman), Alabama's pimp and his faceoff with Clarence or Vincenzo (Christopher Walken) having a faceoff with Clarence's dad, Clifford (Dennis Hopper), to just simply disappear from the film completely is indicative of something of a fractured storytelling mechanic. It would be like Hans Landa never appearing again in Inglourious Basterds after his first scene. The plot device keeping it all whole, though, is the suitcase full of cocaine that Clarence accidentally takes from Drexl's pad.And Clarence and Alabama going to LA to shack up with his actor wannabe friend, Dick (Michael Rapaport), to try and use his contacts (what few he has) to sell the large stash is entertaining. It just doesn't really seem connected to what came before all that strongly. Yes, it has the plot mechanics and characters to do it, but this doesn't feel like a flowing story but more like a series of episodes of television. I think that's why I don't embrace the film as much as many others. There's a disconnect from one major segment to the next that feels like something that should have been smoothed over in a rewrite.That being said, those individual pieces are a fun combination of Tarantino characters and dialogue along with Tony Scott's style. Scott is a solid actor's director, and he gets good performances out of everyone, relying heavily, of course, on that quality dialogue from Tarantino. Scott's style is out of synch with Tarantino's, Scott preferring the action over the buildup (yes, Kill Bill Volume 1 exists, but so does Kill Bill Volume 2). He does the action well, even changing a scene to happen at an amusement park so he can film a roller coaster. He also brought in the Joel Silver comparison because of his bad experience on The Last Boy Scout with Saul Rubinek playing Lee Donowitz approximately like Silver behaved (providing the only real bite to the satirical side of the Hollywood view).The actual movement of the plot never feels like its fated or inevitable, more randomly getting there, making it feel episodic in ways that singular stories shouldn't be. The Italian mobsters, for instance, largely fall out of the film for a large chunk only to suddenly show up at the finale, mixing up in the sting operation for the cocaine local police have set up. This is where having Walken come back might have helped tie everything together, especially with such a violent end for Clarence's father that gets completely forgotten by the film since Clarence simply never finds out what happened.The heart of the film is that relationship between Clarence and Alabama, though, and once you get past the manic-pixy-dream-girl aspect of Alabama's character, it's actually a rather sweet, if somewhat twisted romance between the two. He's willing to go to any pulpy end to protect her, from confronting drug dealers to selling half a million dollars' worth of cocaine to a Hollywood producer while BSing his way through every meeting. The way that Alabama falls all over him while Clarence portrays cool is just endearing. There are obvious, heavy parallels to Terrence Malick's Badlands, the least of which could not be the use of Orff's tune by Hans Zimmer, rescored slightly as ""You're So Cool"", but it's been twisted in a way where the guy who kills is cool and justified, taking a poetic tragedy of Americana and making it into pop culture infused celebration of movie tropes.I don't mind that, but it's just kind of interesting to note.That being said, it's pretty good. It's an entertainment first and foremost, and it does it well. Tony Scott again works from a solid script, this time with far less tampering by his producers and stars, and he has the room and appropriate space to make his visual stylings fit reasonably well (I think this script as is might have worked better with Tarantino's focus on buildup rather than payoff, but that's just me). There's a sweet core, some solid action, and a lot of fun dialogue along the way. It's quality entertainment from Scott.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Really.....This is Fake Romance,"A movie that is well acted (Dennis Hoppers cameo is brilliant), but its a movie aimed at a peculiar audience. Quite simply...life is not like this...a Mickey Mouse cartoon is nearer to the truth. There is a lot of blood, a lot of killing (which leads to dead bodies.) The ""loving"" relationship is as fake as relationships can get. This is a world which may exist on a parallel Universe, and thats fine. By the end, I realized i had been watching a film which had dared me to become a believer. I could never believe in this type of slaughter. And all over some white powder. This strangely synthetic movie made a lot of money at the box office. What does that mean? There are a lot of odd, lonely people in the world.",4.0,Anonymous,Romance
Tarantino's best script,"Remains Tarantino's pulpiest, most kinetic and engaging script to date. Filled with incredibly dynamic performances from an all star cast, the film serves as a master class in both crime comedy genre as well as the overall modern gangster tale. Fueled by memorable scenes and pitch perfect performances from a murderers' row of talent, including Slater and Arquette (til this day one of the best on screen couples ever) to memorable supporting parts by legends like Hopper, Gandolfini, Walken, and Brad Putt as a stoner who is forced to give directions to some mobsters while seriously under the influence.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Romance and violence,"It is one of those films that absolutely deserves more hype! Directed by Tony Scott and written by Quentin Tarantino, this film is a wild ride from start to finish. It's a perfect blend of love, chaos, and a ton of quirky characters. The story follows Clarence (played by Christian Slater) and Alabama (Patricia Arquette), who have this whirlwind romance that quickly spirals into a crazy adventure. What starts as a sweet love story takes some dark turns as they get entangled with mobsters, drugs, and all kinds of mayhem. The chemistry between Slater and Arquette is fantastic,you really root for these two crazy kids! Plus, the supporting cast is stacked with legends like Gary Oldman (who plays a memorable character), Dennis Hopper, and Christopher Walken. The dialogue is sharp, funny, and dripping with that signature Tarantino flair. Visually, it's stylish and has that gritty '90s feel that adds to the overall vibe. It's got everything: romance, violence, drama, and some absolutely iconic moments.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

Peak filmmaking,"It was my second time viewing True Romance - the first being probably about a decade ago, around 2010. All I really remembered about it was that Gary Oldman's character was quite controversial, quite intimidating, and his performance quite impressive, while I also loosely remembered Arquette and Slater's characters falling in love. I also remember that I loved the movie thoroughly, and this time, I felt the same. It feels like a Tarantino movie because it is - his writing is clear, and if you ask me, it's one of Tarantino's best works. May I also say that Patricia Arquette in this is one of the great babes of my lifetime, if not of all time - simply stunning. Visionary, fat-free directing by Tony Scott, electric pacing designed to stimulate consistently, oodles of over-the-top sequences, a zany score by Hans Zimmer that at time reaches into realms of emotional beauty as well, and a plot structure that manages to say incredibly simple but feel completely progressive the entire time. And so many of the incredible ensemble cast only need one or two scenes to put in a classic performance, from Oldman to Walken to Hopper to Sizemore and so on. And Slater is as likable as ever. It's his Heathers character taken to an even further tier, yet in a more realistic manner. This film is sheer entertainment constructed in the most gleeful manner. Peak filmmaking.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"An amazing cast list, and a fine turn by Saul Rubinek.","I've nothing to add to an already comprehensively reviewed film, except a word about Saul Rubinek's performance. He plays Lee Donowitz, a corrupt Hollywood movie producer with criminal tendencies.It's tempting to speculate that the part was based on an actual person (quite possible in La La Land). Whatever the origin, Rubinek portrays the character with enormous skill - sleazy, charming, camp, vulnerable and menacing all at once. His final anguished outburst after discovering he has been betrayed is surprisingly moving and alarmingly convincing. Terrific acting. Bravo. Indeed, the movie is full of superb performances from a once-in-a-lifetime cast.",,Anonymous,Romance
Sweet Romance film - with some bits of violence,"True Romance is a fun, entertaining and full of ride movie. Quite a Tarantino film you can say. If anyone would have told me this film was directed by him, I would have probably believed them.Starring the lovely couple duo Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette, along with an assemble of other great actors. This odd romance film is a pleasant surprise for anyone who whishes to watch a romance story with some bits of action and violence that only Tarantino can deliver.I would even extend and say this movie reminded me of Baby Driver (2017), one of my all-time favorite movies. Maybe Baby was inspired by True Romance.The script manages to swift the audience throughout the whole story: starting with what seems as a simple love tale, leading to a crime and murder, following a chase around the country and a journey for freedom.Another element implanted into the story are the characters being film buffs and pop culture nerds, whenever there is a movie reference or a conversation about movies you can feel that it's Tarantino's writing style, a style that I love so much and wish to make myself one day.Overall I really enjoyed this film and think it's a nice mixture between love and violence, the kind of mixture I didn't know Quentin can write but glad he did.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Painfully Enjoyable,"Whenever I watch this movie, I have to get ready the mute button: that disgusting ""N"" word pops out of one of my favorite actors, and he says it more than once. The worst part of this scene, is that it's my favorite one(Rock/me/A Hard Place). Christopher Walken and Dennis Hopper are the best actors in this entire movie. Not to put down the others, but doesn't anyone disagree that that scene is their favorite one? My favorite quote:""...it's better to have a gun and not need it, than to need a gun and not have it"". It rides along with that old boy scout motto: always be prepared, but Clarence's way has more lettering, and funnier. You forget that it's a romance until the ending, otherwise people focus on the violence and the profanity. Ridley Scott did a good job of handling Quentin's script (no comment on Oliver Stone's butchering of Natural Born Killers), but I want to see more of QT's direction, (and less of his acting). He'll use that disgusting ""N"" word, and we'll call him a genius, and I'll be venturing out to view his latest,""Kill Bill"".",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

A Sign of Things to Come,"I've been a fan of Quentin Tarantino since I saw Pulp Fiction almost ten years ago. Not long after that, I rented Reservoir Dogs and also True Romance, and fell in love with them both. I bought Reservoir Dogs on video, but for some reason never purchased True Romance, until recently when I picked up the Special Edition DVD. Time has passed, obviously. I still like Tarantino, and I count Jackie Brown as one of my top ten favorite movies of all time. But True Romance, it seems, hasnt really aged well. Thats not to say that it is, by any means, a bad movie. It's not. What it means is that, looking back on it now, you can see future Tarantino-ism's, before they really matured. Theres the love-story at it's center, not unlike Natural Born Killers (and even to an extent Jackie Brown). The stoner who sits on the couch all day smoking. The Mexican Stand-off. I could go on, but I think you see my point. True Romance was the first screenplay that he wrote, and it makes sense that some of what he wrote would find its way into his other movies. I'm not faulting the movie for that. What I am saying, though, is that if you've seen all of his other movies, then you have seen this.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Good acting, poorly directed","As I was watching this movie, lots of things just felt wrong. For example, the way the met seemed so trite, until I learned more about it later on. Overall, the movie didn't work for me. And the ending was a complete cop-out. The hero never has to look at the things he has done, and doesn't even find out what happened to someone he was very close to.Then I read Q. Tarentino's script. Wow! It was so much better than what we saw on the screen. He didn't tell the story in chronological order, so the things that didn't work for me in the movie actually worked really well in the script. And the ending made a whole lot more sense. It's a shame that Director Tony Scott tried to improve on the script. It would have been much better if done Tarentino's way.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance

I think the title turns most people off, and I remember a critic saying that back then.But that is my point. If you follow this movie closely, and you know how Quentin loves his dialog, you will realize that this is a very very romantic movie. What Clarence does for his love, is close to what spiderman does in his favorite comic book he talks about. Clarence is just a mild mannered, boring nobody, he's not a gangster or tough guy.. it's just what he is willing to do for his soulmate and to guarantee a happy ever after.OK, enough.. nobody will probably read this.. but I just had to throw my 2 cents in about my most favorite movie of all time.

They're just two kids with big dreams, its easy to imagine this in medieval times, talk about romance, peasant boys kills evil warlord to defend his lady's honor! Actually Clarence offs Drexl, unbelievably played by GAry Oldman, what a great actor!The cast is unreal! Brad Pitt plays permanently high roomie Floyd and makes you wonder what happened to this brilliant actor.

"Tony Scott, as usual wreaks havoc","Based upon a screenplay by Quentin Tarantino (Reservoir Dogs, Jackie Brown) and directed by Tony Scott (Top Gun, Enemy of the State) 'True Romance' follows the humorous and sometimes violent love story of young comic book store worker and Kung Fu film obsessive Clarence Worley (Christian Slater) and his wife, a former hooker named Alabama Whitman (Patricia Arquette). Through a situation involving Alabama's mean spirited pimp Drexl Spivey (Gary Oldman), the couple ends up with a big score of drugs and hit the road to LA in order to sell the drugs and to find a place to settle down. As they pursue the goal, Vincenzo Coccoti (Christopher Walken) tries to get his drugs back by using twisted mafia goon Virgil (James Gandolfini). Thrown into the mix are two cops looking to make a name for themselves (Chris Penn and Tom Sizemore), Clarence's friend Dick (Michael Rapaport) and his stoner buddy Floyd (Brad Pitt), a thickheaded Hollywood producer's agent Lee Donowitz (Saul Rubinek), and an enigmatic Elvis style mentor (Val Kilmer) and 'True Romance' is the result. The list of actors is impressive, not to mention Dennis Hopper as Clarence's ex - cop father. As the plot develops, many of these characters get more and more involved with one another until a huge shootout climax at the end involving many of these people.The screenplay by Quentin Tarantino is, as usual, heavy on scorching, quick dialogue from everyone on board. The relationship between Clarence and Alabama is wild and filled with youth and vigor as the couple constantly expresses their physical attraction with one other. In other words, they have a lot of sex. While a good sum of the characters are criminals, Tarantino opts to make them distinct. While the cops speak quickly and in bursts of spit, characters like Coccoti are given more careful, slick dialogue and sometimes even monologues (a similar example can be seen in the character Bill of 'Kill Bill: Vol. 2'). They talk in rapid fire ways with a lot of personality and a lot of gusto, and Tarantino tries his absolute hardest to make it all sound real and clever. Like in 'Reservoir Dogs', he fails. While its not alone his fault, the relationship between Clarence and Alabama seems forced rather than natural. The audience is supposed to feel their passion for one another, but instead of throwing at us something to work with Tarantino simply tries to make up for it with sex scenes. The ""realistic"" dialogue doesn't come across that way, once again not every person in the world says ""f*ck"" every second line. These characters are incredibly basic and simple, with little to no depth underneath their looks.Tony Scott, known for usually directing action type films doesn't exactly go the distance in the case of 'True Romance'. His direction follows what is on the page given to him by Tarantino, and while some of the performances are noteworthy it seems to be the case from the actors themselves instead of Scott's direction. Its a wonder how he assembled such a fine ensemble together, but he makes poor use of most of them, and such fine actors like Gary Oldman are given much smaller roles. There are some clever moments throughout the film, but nothing too noteworthy. It feels as is Scott's direction is patchy, and the violent comes of as brash and obnoxious. There are a few scenes of extremely graphic violence, but Scott seems to shove it so much in the audience's face that they turn away in disgust. It doesn't feel necessary to the story like it should. In the case of other films with high levels of bloody violence, its used to a level where it shows the means of the plot but in 'True Romance' its rubbish and it even detracts from the film.I give some credit to 'True Romance'. Its by no means a bad movie, and the cast gives some solid performances all around. Tarantino's screenplay has its moments, and the movie is definitely entertaining but Scott's abusive direction and Tarantino's trademark messy screenplay aren't enough to propel the film into something ""good"". Instead, it turns out to be mediocre.7/10",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

Greatest Casting in Cinematic History!,"I consider myself an average movie fan. My DVD collection is modest, about 125 titles, but nothing compared to the thousands that my friends have.

I ventured to the video store that night and, with reservations, found the movie on the shelf and checked it out. Fast forward three hours...This movie is perfect in every aspect. It has great directing, excellent casting, magnificent dialogue, great music, the whole package. Every actor does a superb job in their role and you feel like you really get to know the main characters. This is by far the best Tarantino movie of all. I'm not sure why this movie is not in the IMDb ""Top 250"", I guess its because it is relatively unknown.I beg you, please see this movie. You will absolutely not be let down. I have recommended this movie to many friends and family members and, so far, I've not had one person say that they were disappointed. This is not ""Reservior Dogs"" or ""Pulp Fiction"", its a modern love story (not a sappy, tear-jerker), mixed with hard-core action, and gangsters.Prior to seeing this movie I always said that ""Lonesome Dove"" and ""The Godfather"" tied for my favorite movie of all time....

"Fun enough to watch, not too pulpy.","I have to be honest, with the cast and the over the top reviews I was mildly disappointed after finishing this film. It is a nice fast pace dark comedy/action movie, with nice Tarantino's dialogues, a few fantastic scenes and a couple of great performances. Overall a really good/fun 90s film. The story is solid enough, and the plot evolves nicely torwards a great shoutout scene. The comedy is not brilliant but it holds up, I really liked the Elvis role as the main characters conscience, and the Gary Oldman's portrayal of the pimp, made me laugh a bit. However, when you have such an amazing cast it really seems like it falls short from what It could have been.Certainly not a really original idea, but with the QT touch it is fun enough to watch, and IMO far from QT best work or even a top 90s film, I say this because of some reviews I have read.

The Best Tarantino movie,"Even though directed by Tony Scott, this is the best Tarantino movie. Any great movie needs several stand out scenes and that is just what True Romance has. Clarence (Slater) is set up with a call girl Alabama (Arquette) for a birthday present. They fall for each other and Clarence looks to even things out with Drexl (Oldman) which leads to a rather violent conclusion. This sets the tone for the movie and anybody that has a squemish nature should steer clear of the movie. Some people may also find some of the language a bit industrial and it's not always politically correct in terms of race and gender.The ensemble cast put in some outstanding performances and the film is gripping from start to finish. If I was being really nit picking I'd suggest the ending was a bit weak, but it's just so good upto that point who cares. I'm sure Tarantino would have liked to have shoved this script away on his mantlepiece for a few years, because it knocks the spots off Kill Bill. With non stop action, great acting, unfussy direction and spellbinding script this is undoubtedly one of the finest modern day films to come out of Hollywood. 10/10",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Not really recommended,"Prior watching this movie I took a look at IMDb to see if there's any risk of facing a crap by choosing this title. Score 7 I saw here, was indicating that there's lower chance of such situation (however I've already faced a few movies high ranked here that I simply consider pure waste of time. Matter of taste). So I picked up the movie, hoping that if it become a mess I at least enjoy watching Patricia Arquette.And I was unfortunately right. The movie is simply a crap. Starting from the silly story, non-convincing acting and stupidity of the main characters - all this makes the movie a disaster. I was watching it, hoping ""it will start to make sense on next scene"". But it did not. I don't know why ratings are so high here - it says ""Tarantino"" in the credits, so maybe people think, ""Oh, it can't be crap. I just missed the point. It's my fault"". And they rate it then - 8, 9, 10(!) for no real reason.I rated it 4 stars (and I think 3 would be still fair enough): 1 star for Gary Oldman's scene in the club, 2nd star for stoned Pitt scene and last 2 stars for Arquette (but the credits here goes rather for Mother Nature, not for the her ""acting"" I am afraid).To summarize: if you love B/C class movies - give it a try (but don't expect the Godzilla in it anyway).

You are so cool!,"""If you gave me a million years to ponder, I would never have guessed that true romance and Detroit would ever go together.""I would never have guessed that Tony Scott and Quentin Tarantino would ever go together, but what a pleasant surprise this romantic crime thriller turned out to be. Thanks to a sharp and witty script and entertaining characters True Romance was extremely cool. The best way I can describe this film is to take Patricia Arquette's character's words and sound like a broken record: all I could think of while watching this film was Quentin Tarantino you are so cool; Tony Scott you are so cool; every single actor in this film you are so cool, True Romance you are so cool. I can't believe I had to wait 21 years to get around to watching this considering how big of a Quentin Tarantino fan I am (and I'm also a huge fan of Tony Scott's work in Man on Fire). Tarantino's energetic script and Scott's stylized direction blended perfectly in this near masterpiece. The cast is absolutely brilliant here and there are so many memorable characters and scenes in this film. I think I enjoyed this film more watching it for the first time now than if I would have seen it in 1993 considering there are so many familiar faces that I probably wouldn't have recognized back then. Brad Pitt, Val Kilmer, Dennis Hopper, Gary Oldman, Christopher Walken, Samuel L. Jackson, James Gandolfini, and Chris Penn all have small but memorable roles. Oldman is barely recognizable playing a pimp with dreadlocks and a glass eye, but it is a unique performance. Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette give the performance of their careers here; it's a shame Slater has been in so many terrible films in the past decade because his performance here was promising. Arquette is adorable as Alabama and I can't think of another sweeter performance than hers. There is so much energy and charm in this film that it's hard to resist. Like good wine, True Romance will probably age better over time considering I couldn't believe how much fun I was having watching an early 90's film for the first time. True Romance you are so cool!Clarence Worley (Christian Slater) is a comic book store clerk who also happens to be a martial arts film buff. He plans to spend his birthday as he always does, at the movies, watching a triple feature of Sonny Chiba. What he doesn't expect is that he will find the love of his life there. While he is watching the film, a pretty woman walks into the theater spilling her popcorn all over him. She apologizes and introduces herself as Alabama (Patricia Arquette). The two fall in love with each other after she opens up to him about her true identity. This leads them through a series of dangerous adventures involving pimps (Gary Oldman), the Sicilian mafia (Christopher Walken, James Gandolfini), drug dealers (Samuel L. Jackson), police officials (Chris Penn, Tom Sizemore), and Hollywood producers (Saul Rubinek, Bronson Pinchot). The film is full of energy and thrills as the two lovers face several obstacles along the way. Thankfully, Clarence seems to have a mentor on his side to guide him: an apparition of his idol Elvis Presley (Val Kilmer) who is sort of his conscious.Even if you aren't a huge fan of Tarantino you could still enjoy True Romance for all the beloved actors in this film that weren't probably big Hollywood names back then. The film moves so quickly and the script is so energetic that It makes for a very entertaining watch. There are so many memorable scenes in this film, like the face off between Gary Oldman and Christian Slater, the group Mexican standoff, and the violent hotel scene involving Gandolfini and Arquette, but the real scene stealer would have to be the one in which Dennis Hopper, who plays Clarence's father, is ambushed by Christopher Walken and his gang and they have a not so friendly chat about Sicilians. It was a pure Tarantino moment and there are a lot of these great dialogues that allow for the film to have such a great pace and move along so nicely. The style and characters in this film make it such a unique experience and film lovers will enjoy the Hollywood satire as well. I am so glad I finally got to see this wild and romantic film. This is another reason why Tony Scott will be missed.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Best of all time.,The greatest love story ever told. It's 2021 and still amazes me when Tarantino fans say they've never seen this movie. Best story and the cast is mind blowing.,10.0,Anonymous,Romance
A masterpiece,"To me this movie is a masterpiece! Everything works in this movie. The cinematography is great. The story is compelling. The music is beautiful. The acting is superb. There is a lot of humor. There is some nice action. And there is drama. For me to tell me what the story is about would be sacrilege. You have to see it for yourself and you will be amazed. Very important is the fact that this is a movie you can watch over and over again. ""True Romance"" suggests a romantic love story. It is about love and the consequences of this love. After several viewings you will discover more themes. I know that Quentin Tarantino wrote the screenplay and you will recognize his influence:wonderful dialog and tribute to Hong Kong and Japanese movies (""Streetfighter Trilogy"" with Sonny Chiba is playing in the cinema where Clarence meets Alabama,At Clarence's home Alabama is watching "" a better tomorrow 2"" from John Woo). But the story works so good because of the great characters. All of the characters in the movie are interesting and there are many of them. You will hate them,love them, laugh with them,yell at them,in short you will be involved. ""True Romance"" is a masterpiece!",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Gory mess.,"This film starts quite promising, tails off a bit after 30 minutes, and the less is said about the gory final the better.

True Romance - a definitive QT trend-setter....,"True Romance is an incredible movie; not only are the characters rich, well developed and highly interesting...but there are many subtle parts to the movie that are incorporated in later QT works. The triple feature that Clarence goes to (the Sonny Chiba films; Sonny plays a prominent role in Kill Bill, as Hattori Honso), the Samuel Jackson character (a brief but brilliant sign of things to come in Pulp Fiction), and the way Tarantino includes various cameos and short scenes that seem to lift already popular actors to an even higher plateau are just a few things I love about this film. Did you know that James Gandolfini's scene in the hotel room with Patricia Arquette is the defining scene that secured his being cast as Tony Soprano? Gary Oldman shows how versatile he is by playing a well disguised white pimp with amazing dialogue; the scene between Christopher Walken and Dennis Hopper is (in my opinion) one of the greatest ever filmed. The Director's Cut version of this movie has a slightly different ending to the shootout; subtle, but strangely powerful. I would HIGHLY recommend this film to anyone who enjoys the wacky, brilliant world of Quentin Tarantino.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
this film has it all!,"Normally I don't write commentaries on things like this but when prompted to do so for this film I felt compelled to do so. This movie could have won an academy award for some of it's scenes! too bad they were too controversial to ever be considered.... Christopher Walken and Dennis Hopper in the trailer scene.... AMAZING! This movie has a cast second to none and has been seen by so few (at least men) due to it's title :) There is comedy, action, drama and even some romance. Something for everyone in my opinion. Just not for the kids ;) If you have not seen this film do yourself a favor and do so. I bet you will thank me or in the case of the women, want to slap me :) and no you don't have to be a huge Quentin Tarantino fan to appreciate this movie. You just have to like movies!Enjoy",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Overrated fantasy,"This is a film that started out strong, then fell apart. The only thing that saves it is the acting, which is superb. Patricia Arquette is particularly good.Clarence (Christian Slater) plays a complete fool, who lives in a fantasy world, and tries to live out a movie fantasy. Reality occasionally rears it's ugly head, but never when Clarence is around to see. He never has to face any consequences for his foolishness. He never even finds out that his actions lead to the death someone close to him, much less grieve for the poor fool.The ending is a complete cop-out. We're asked to maintain the same state of denial that Clarence is in. (Don't read the rest of this paragraph if you don't want to know.) Imagine if the Godfather ended with Michael and his wife breaking out the Champagne bottles to celebrate his victory over his enemies, then living happily ever after.Years after seeing this movie, I found Quentin Tarantino's script in a bookstore. Wow! What a great script. It's the same story, but it's structured differently, and it works a lot better. It also has a much more believable ending, which doesn't descend into codependence. It's too bad Tony Scott had to butcher the film. Don't see this movie. Read Tarantino's script.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance
The Lot,"This film truly has the lot. It is remarkably romantic with action, drama and suspense added to the mix. Christian Slater's finest performance, Patricia Arquette is undeniably perfect mix of sexy cute with a beautiful vunerabality. Add to these fantastic characters immense performances from James Gandolfini, Chris Penn, Gary Oldman, Christopher Walken, Dennis Hopper and many more. The soundtrack adds to the amazing sparkle of this 90's classic. Amazingly written, scored, acted and directed. I wish this film had higher recognition as a true classic.

Talk about bad timing,"I really liked Tony Scott. And Tarantino, who wrote the script. That True Romance didn't find an audience, we can blame Pulp Fiction and Natural Born Killers for. The former stole it's thunder, and is a special, special movie. The latter destroyed it's reputation, since True Romance got compared to NBK. It's much better than Oliver Stones movie. It's a love story, packed in tons of violence. And I got my first real movie crush watching the lovely Patricia Arquette, who talks like she's singing. It has no real ground in reality, it's a fairy tale about two mismatches meeting. But the payoff is a movie that deserved better. From Brad Pitt's scenestealing crackhead, to the strangest edition of Gary Oldman this side of Dracula, to the ultra-violent showdown between James Gandolfini and Patricia Arquette, True Romance delivers on every cylinder.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

A hit and a miss...,"TRUE ROMANCE, like most of what Tony Scott directed, is worth seeing. The one sour note (for me) was the ridiculous scene-chewing by Gary Oldman as a Pasta (a white Rastafarian); not only doesn't it ring true, but it's SO over the top that it undercuts the other, much better performances by everyone else throughout the film. Christian Slater (the once-promising young Jack Nicholson) carries the load admirably, and Patricia Arquette is sexier than ever. If Quentin Tarantino should be remembered for any one film, it's this one: it's by far the best movie bearing his name- thanks to a mostly outstanding cast, guided by a director who really knew his stuff.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Only a specific type of audience will like this. If you're sane, stay away.","This film feels like it was written by teenager with serious mental problems.

The screenplay is pure garbage and as for the overall plot the less said the better.

The Perfect Recipe,"Apart from being the breathtaking cinematic experience that it is, True Romance doubles as a masterclass in movie production by selecting the very finest ingredients: cracking script, mouthwatering acting talent and stylish director.Many have been quick to point out the Tarantino script and wealth of star actors but few have acknowledged the input of the film's director.  Being a fellow Brit, I can't help but feel proud to know that one of the finest thrillers of the decade was directed by Tony Scott.With this film, Scott proves he has the ability to handle wordplay as well as anyone.  If there was ever any doubt before, merely breathe in the chilling, claustrophobic atmosphere he crafted in the Hopper/Walken scene. Scott was also able to mold memorable character moments for all the other cameo players.  A feat all the more remarkable, considering the limited amount of screen time given to each actor.  Even the Tom Sizemore character lingers in the mind, despite the frantic editing each moment he's on screen.Unfortunately, I cannot acknowledge Tarantino (the director) with the same regard. His blistering screenplays all contain the trademark incisive repartee but Tarantino's directorial style caters too much to the scriptwriter.  Tarantino merely shoots the actors performing to dialogue (similar to that of a parent videotaping his child in a school play). Considering the excellence of his writing and the ability of each actor, this approach almost works but an experienced director is needed to sustain a visual momentum.  As a result of his one-dimensional approach, all three Tarantino films suffer from the occasional pocket of tedium. One example would be the Jack Rabbit Slim's scene in Pulp Fiction (an opinion also shared by the film's editor - Sally Menke). I even heard someone SNORING during my screening of Jackie Brown.  Tony Scott may have the reputation of favouring style over content, but once given a quality script, he has the ability to carry it with precision timing as well as flair which leaves you feeling like you've seen an electrifying movie as opposed to an electrifying play.This is not to disregard the fact that Tarantino has directed many classic movie moments but his forte remains behind the pen  not the megaphone.  It can be argued that out of all his screenplays, the two most entertaining movies were True Romance and From Dusk Til Dawn.  Neither of which were directed by Tarantino himself.  As True Romance has shown, once you have the very best players working in their respective fields, the result can be awesome.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

You will have True Love for True Romance,"True Romance, I have seen this movie about 50 times, No lie. And I can tell you right now, that every time I have watched it, I liked it even more. One reason why I did not write this review a long time go, when the movie came out is..... well...... The movie came out in 1993. Im 25 now and I'm pretty sure it was not a good movie for a lil dude to watch . But let me tell you, when i got older, I was never so happy to find an older movie that I loved Right off the bat! So that being said, let me give you a lil plot summary to spice up this review a bit. Clarence and Alabama are newlyweds who acquire an unexpected wedding present. Unknown to the blissfully happy couple, ruthless gangsters are on their tail, determined to reclaim their lost property......First I wanna get into the writing. Quentin Tarantino Is a great, great writer, Known for writing movies like, Reservoir Dogs, Pulp Fiction, Natural born Killers, From Dusk Till Dawn , Jackie Brown, Kill Bill vol 1 and 2, Death Proof, Inglourious Basterds and his upcoming film Django Unchained (which he all directed). So Obviously he has skills. but even with all those great movies under his belt. I think that True Romance is the best thing he has wrote..... SO far that is. and thats saying A lot. Just the way the story moves along and keeps you interested is Beautiful!!!!! By the end of the movie you feel like you know these characters and you actually care for them. You don't want anything bad to happen to them or worse die.The Directing, Tony F-ing Scott (Tony Scott) WOW! Known for Directing (just gonna say the ones i like) Top Gun, Crimson Tide, Enemy Of the State, Spy Game, Man On Fire, Domino, Deja Vu, The taking of Pelham 123, and unstoppable. In True Romanced He did an Outstanding job capturing the scenes and angles where you actually feel like your in the room with the characters. You feel there tension, the love, the hate and the innocence. For Example there is a scene with a GANGTER/PIMP (gary Oldman, Believe it or not) and Clarence (Christian Slater), In this scene you feel and see the anger clarence has towards this pimp, but its the way Tony Scott presents these scenes with there theme and mood that get the hairs on your neck to LITERALLY stand up. True Story, It happens to me every time i watch it. And it happens more then once.The Music, First off i wanna say Hans Zimmer is the man and if you have read any of my other reviews you will know that he is one of my favs. Known for (Seriously there is way to many so I'm only saying a few, and that's still gonna be a lot) Inception, Gladiator, The Dark Knight, Batman Begins, The Da Vinci Code, Black Hawk Down, The Last Samurai, The Rock and The Lion King. So in this film the music sounds like we are about to go to an island and drink pina coladas or go lay on the beach in the nice hot sun........ Sorry not happening here. Instead it throws you off a lil and makes you focus on whats going on in the film. thats what i always liked about Hans, he really sets the theme. But he doesn't always have a song playing in the background. Sometimes its just sounds and weird noises (BUT ITS MUSIC) .SO ALLLLLL OF ^THAT^ being said. Do I think you should go see this movie? What do you think? YES DUUUUUHHHH! The cast is SUPERB, You got Christian Slater (The guy who falls in love), Patricia Arquette ( The girl that falls in love with the guy), Dennis Hopper (The Guys Innoncent Father), Val Kilmer ( ELVIS.... Yes Elvis), Gary Oldman (Ganster/Drug Dealer/Pimp), Brad Pitt (Stoner on the couch, yes that is literally his role the whole movie), Christopher Walken (The DON of the MAFIA Family in this film), Samuel L. Jackson (Drug Dealer), Michael Rapaport (Cop), James Gandolfini (Mafia Muscle/Hit-man). I mean the cast ALONE is worth the watch. But then you got Quentin Tarantino Writing it, Tony Scott Directing it, hans Zimmer Composing it. LIKE what could be better? NOTHING!

"Horrible, over-acted and dull movie","First of all, the acting is really over-acted all the way of the movie till the ending credits. Acting ruins everything and makes the movie unwatchable and even the serious scenes appears comic unfortunately. In addition, the soundtrack is dull and stupid, what were they thinking? Perhaps nothing. The plot is boring and not interesting; enough reasons to hit fast-forward after the first thirty minutes of the movie. I have to give one star because of the Arquette's beautiful eyes and buxom body, they will never disappoint and there is no option to give zero stars on IMDb. Finally, there are plenty of drug/crime-related movies to watch ie. this is easy to forget as quickly as possible.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
most mens dream women lies within Patricia,"For me this movie has to be my all-time favourite, until (if-ever) i see a better one with a better story and better actors(not-likely). Christian slater has always been,in my opinion,one of the finest young stars to have emerged when this film was first released. His James-dean style image adds a certain depth of character to his acting in this and many of his movies. Patricia arquette plays the role of Clarence's (slaters) girlfriend so well, that i stand here today and challenge any-man to tell me that you don't remotely want to love or get to know her in at least a small way. The way Alabama (arquette) genuinely falls for Clarence for me was one of the many fine-points about this excellent script. Coupled with the fact that there love for each other bonds almost instantly & Clarence's jackanapeses makes Alabama his perfect life-partner, because they are chalk & cheese plus she tames her Clarence!!. Both these factors make the scene - where James Gandolfini subjects her to the beating to obtain information, genuinely heartfelt for the viewer. Every thread inside me wanted to put gandolfini down, and have Alabama run back into Clarence's hands. Because there love for each other was just meant to be. Yes this film has a-lot of action & violence in it, but this just makes Quentin Tarantino's predominant love-story a-lot more genuine. Adding tony-Scott's direction makes this one movie you will never forget...... Because it really was TRUE ROMANCE.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Best movie scene of all time IMO,"Has there ever been a better acted more intense scene than Dennis Hooper asking Christopher Walken if he is lying? In my opinion the best short scene of all time. The movie is a great ride of romance, sex, love and violence. Even though most actors in this movie have small roles, they all are acted superbly. Gary Oldman is fantastic is his brief scene as a drug dealer. Brad Pitt has a drug user (stoner) also amazing. It's fun and full of excitement. Tarantino wrote the script and the dialogue is quick and witty. I highly recommend this movie! One of my favorites of all time.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Go on take the money and run!,"Or shall I say contraband? Either way this high-voltage thriller will have you on the edge of your seat for 120 minutes. This script was anything but beginner's luck, Knoxville born Quentin Tarantino's first script geared for a major motion picture was in fact originally intended to be written and directed by Tarantino himself but due to the ""business of Hollywood"" he sold it and the direction went to the already veteran director Tony Scott. Nonetheless True Romance exemplifies the epitome of what 1990's action movies were all about, Adrenaline.With an all star cast and a lineup of amazing scenes this movie is packed with excitement from the very start. The monologues are captivating, the violence is bombarding, and the story itself is surprisingly charming. Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette deliver a dynamic lead portraying a love-struck fantasy for any couple wishing to keep their relationship on the outer realm of exciting, to say the least.The supporting cast is superb, consisting of many big names and faces that have rocked the silver screen for decades. The talent and delivery from this supporting crew can only be believed when experienced. From mobsters and police, hookers, and tough guys, movie producers and gangsters, stoners and pimps, even the humble voice of a musical legend, this eclectic mix of characters unravel the 1990's and opens the door to a wide array of critics leaving only one opinion that is truly relevant, yours.-Eric Douglas Statzer",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
"The King, Chiba, White Boy Day and LoveBloody Love.","True Romance is directed by Tony Scott and written by Quentin Tarantino. It stars Christian Slater, Patricia Arquette, Dennis Hopper, Brad Pitt, Val Kilmer, Gary Oldman, Michael Rapaport, Christopher Walken, James Gandolfini, Chris Penn, Tom Sizemore, Bronson Pinchot and Saul Rubinek. Music is by Hans Zimmer and cinematography by Jeffery L. Kimball.Comic book store clerk Clarence Worley (Slater) falls in love with call girl Alabama Whitman (Arquette) when she turns up at the movie theatre as one of his birthday presents. Marriage is quick but as the whirlwind romance gathers apace, complications quickly follow in the form of psycho drug dealers and the mob!It's still speculated on how True Romance would have panned out had Tarantino directed his own screenplay, but really in the grand scheme of things it doesn't matter. For True Romance is a wildly exciting fusion of lovers on the lam premise with violence a go go thrills.Director Scott did a bang up job bringing Tarantino's screenplay to life, even making a couple of narrative changes that suits (QT agrees) the picture no end. People often get hung up on the fact that Scott had previously helmed Top Gun, Beverly hills Cop II and Days of Thunder, citing these as reasons that Scott was wrong for the material, yet the film he did immediately before True Romance was The Last Boy Scout, a thrilling and muscular actioner that pings with sharp savvy dialogue scripted by Shane Black. It was the perfect trial run for True Romance, and Scott proved to be a wise and cohesive choice for the material. He also expertly marshalled a large ensemble cast, garnering career high turns from Slater and Arquette in the process.Almost everything clicks into place on True Romance, it never lacks for kinetic thrills or edge of the seat drama. In turn it likes to grab you around the throat with some wince inducing violence, cunningly drawing you in to root for a couple of lovers who will do anything for each other, while simultaneously causing carnage for all they come into contact with. There's odd ball characters galore (Oldman and Pitt excelling in this area), exquisite set-pieces and dialogue so sharp you could cut a steak with it. From conversations between Clarence and his imaginary Elvis (Kilmer) mentor, to iconography unbound with one of the 90s great sequences that sees Walken's mob boss verbally joust with Hopper as Clarence's stoic father, it's a film as rich in the art of vocal acting as it is in eye splintering gloss. All that and it's a clinically beautiful love story as well!A wet dream fantasy of QT for sure, and if you wanna be churlish? Then there should have been more room made for Sizemore and Penn's glorious coppers. Hell we could even complain about the editing being a touch too slam-bang at timesBut nah! Small complaints be damned, the meeting of Tarantino the writer and Scott the director delivers neo-noir goodies galore. In fact it's a film that just gets better with age. 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

My #1 movie,"Clarence Worley (Christian Slater) is a lonely, but pretty hip kind of guy. He works in a comic book store, is obsessed with Elvis Presley (he even talks to his ghost, whom of which is played by Val Kilmer), and has a thing for Kung-Fu films.  Things take a turn for the better when Alabama (Patricia Arquette) walks into his life.  They automatically fall in love and just days after they first meet, they decide to get married.  Alabama, however, has a confession to make: She is a call girl and is determined to leave behind her old life in order to make a fresh start with Clarence.  Even with all of this behind them now, Clarence still has something eating away deep inside him.  It seems that he can't stand the fact that Alabama's former pimp, Drexl (Gary Oldman), who is also a white wannabe homeboy, is breathing the same air as he is.  So Clarence decides to pay Drexl a visit.  Drexl is not exactly anxious to let go of Alabama and so a shootout ensues which leaves Drexl dead and Clarence with a suitcase full of cocaine.  Clarence walks away from the situation as a hero in the eyes of Alabama, but from this you can also conclude that he is very stupid, yet courageous.  After the confrontation, Clarence hatches a brilliant scheme to go on a cross-country road trip to Los Angeles to sell the cocaine to a rich movie producer named Lee Donowitz (Saul Rubinek) and with the money, they can go anywhere in the world that they want.  So Clarence reunites with his childhood buddy, Dick Ritchie (Michael Rapaport) and his slob of a roommate, Floyd (a very stoned Brad Pitt).  Dick has setup a meeting with Lee through his connection with Elliot Blitzer (Bronson Pinchot) who is Lee's assistant. Clarence's plan seems perfect, except that what he doesn't know is, the cocaine that he stole actually belongs to a group of very p****d off mobsters who have come looking for it.""True Romance"" is now my all time favorite movie.  The performances are excellent and with an all-star cast such as this one, how could it not be? Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette make a very good couple and you cannot help but praise their efforts for what they have to go through to start a new life with each other.  Dennis Hopper and Christopher Walken have one great (and very offensive) scene together.  Gary Oldman is totally off the wall as the wannabe homeboy, Drexl.  Although he is only in two scenes, he does make a lasting impression.  His first scene, which is during a drug buy with Big Don (Samuel L. Jackson), is amongst some of the best parts of the movie.I cannot find a single fault with this movie.  I have noticed that Quentin Tarantino has not received a lot of credit for this movie.  That is most likely due to the fact that he did not direct this movie; that credit goes to Tony ""Top Gun"" Scott.  Of course, since Tarantino DID write this movie, you can expect the following: witty dialogue, unbelievable characters, lots of dark humor, and at least two or more scenes of unsettlingly, brutal violence.  To those who do not know what I am talking about, watch Patricia Arquette's encounter with James Gandolfini in the hotel room or watch the ever-famous ""Mexican Standoff"" at the end.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
True Classic,"True Romance is quite simply put a classic movie. It is also a movie that endures due to its style and content. Based on Quentin Tarantino's fresh script loosely influenced by Terence Malik's Badlands, referenced by Hans Zimmers similar score for the soundtrack. Directing duties passed on to competent visual action director Tony Scott after the success of Tarantino's debut Reservoir Dogs.To be honest I don't think the film could be in better hands than Tony Scott's... His style, visual flair and balls out frenetic action gives Tarantino's pitch perfect script the care and attention the lover's on the run, action thriller truly deserves. Scott has been quoted as acknowledging True Romance as his favourite piece of work as well as recently screening an anniversary showing of his own personal copy of the masterpiece. I only wish I had been there for that experience.The story ignites with two social misfits Alabama Whitman (Patricia Arquette) & Clarence Worley (Christian Slater) meeting at the movie theatre in Detroit where they quickly begin a whirlwind romance. However, Alabama's past comes into the fray and all hell breaks loose as the couple abscond with a suitcase full of trouble, with the mob and police in hot pursuit resulting in a spectacular orgy of ultra violence and punchy dialogue.The calibre of cast in this movie is outstanding all at the top of their game with some note worthy stand out performances such as newcomer Brad Pitt in a perfectly suited stoner role... Also the classic rivalry scene with the late Dennis Hopper trading Tarantino's dialogue with Christopher Walken is something to behold.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Tarantino's Fairy Tale,"I recently read Tarantino's original screenplay to ""True Romance"". Apart from the change in narrative structure (non-chronological), it hints to a bleaker, grittier urban drama, with a tragedy ending. It would be very interesting to see the final film in Tarantino's vision.Tony Scott's sugar-coated adaptation works wonders though. It was made very clear in the script that the relationship between the two leads was very strong. Scott took this unison and gave the film a fairy-tale tone. The villains in the film are very colourful, contributing to the feel that Scott has established. Hans Zimmer's score does nothing better, than to enforce this vision.The cast is one of the most impressive line-ups I've ever seen. Much of the film rests on the shoulders of Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette, both characters come off very likable with clear, clean, simple motives. These are career performances. Dennis Hopper gives good in his limited screen-time as Christian's ex-cop, ex-alcoholic father. It is in his time shared with Christopher Walken (being a one-scene wonder, like in ""Pulp Fiction""), that he comes off at his best. The Sicilian scene is Walken's most intense since ""Deer Hunter"". Gary Oldman also gives another deliciously evil and memorable performance, the man is a chameleon, he is yet to unimpress me.But one of my favourite things about the cast is seeing then-relative-unknowns Samuel L. Jackson, Brad Pitt and James Gandolfini in small, but memorable roles. A real shame that Jackson's performance was cut down heavily from the script, some of the dialogue in his one scene was very amusing, if maybe a little offensive to some.""True Romance"" is a brilliant crime drama, and a perfect (if phased) introduction to Tarantino's work, it is probably the most accessible film he's penned. People will always ponder over whether or not Tarantino's directorial version would have been better, but they can always rest-assure that Scott has given a wonderful adaptation, supported by a very strong cast. It could have been much, much worse. 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
"If you don't like this movie, you are an idiot!","Tony Scott may be Quentin Tarrantion's long lost brother. Granted, the script was written by Tarrantino, and used a few people that would eventually wind up in his films, but the look and feel of this movie is very reminiscent of a Quentin film. Brad Pitt, back when he was still a good actor, nails the pot smoking, looser roommate. Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette make a good couple, although flawed in their life choices at times. But that makes for great cinema. The one thing that can kill or make a movie is a large cast. If the formula is followed to closely, the movie will seem like endless bit parts taped together out of order. If done properly, the movie seamlessly intertwines the lives of unrelated characters, bringing them together in ways they would normally never experience. This is True Romance. A series of events brings together a long cast of great characters and stories. In the end, you will be happy and sad for the ones that made it, and the ones that didn't.This is one of those films with characters that aren't necessarily good or bad, but shades of both at times. And who cares, it's great, and more importantly, it works. This is the type of film that should be taught in film class. Thankfully, it is not, because we would have tons of copies, and work like this isn't easily duplicated.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
One of my favourites,"I think this movie is amazing the dialogue believable and sometimes a bit funny. I may be biased but i'm a girl who loves killing spree movies. or crime movies in general. But this movie was more than that, it had everything! humour, romance (or course), murder, action and drug dealing. lets face it: Christian Slater is at his best when he's holding a gun. Think about it, Heathers was great (he killed a few people) a pretty much MADE Very bad Things enjoyable. and now we have this, Dennis Hopper, Samuel L Jackson, Brad Pitt and Christopher Walken... what a cast! This is the best movie of Patricia Arquette's career, although i'm not well informed of her career but i have certainly seen some of her other films. this obliterates them all. is it over the top? yes is it accurate? no. is it supposed to be over the top and inaccurate? yes because it's a Tarentino movie. his films are amazing and thrilling, not accurate. who cares? just see it, this review hasn't been much help to you i'm sure but take my advice... see it. it almost makes you want to be criminal.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
I love this film,"Y'all can't hear me loud enough. I LOVE THIS MOVIE!!! Few films can withstand the test of 50+ viewings. I don't want to take a lot of time or space here, but it means so much to me to read everybody else's reviews of this joint, and to know that so many other people feel the way I do about it. My man, I don't know your name, said: ""It's true romance... He kills her pimp, and she takes a Royal beating for him. BUT the movies's not over. You have to have pulled some crazy s*** in your life to totally appreciate this movie, but it is awesome."" That's so damn true, it's not funny. If you have a little history of drug dealing, or a little bitty piece of violence in your background, and have ever loved someone else so inherently that you would live and die for that person, you have to be six feet under to not be moved by this movie. Much love to everyone involved in this project, and to all those who ever really felt this movie, I'm buying the first 7 rounds. P.S. Hans Zimmer is a money-whore now, but this is the best score he ever did. It's been borrowed (I know it wasn't original) WAY too many times.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

A dazzling film about pop culture...,"Before there was Pulp Fiction, there was True Romance, which continued writer Quentin Tarantino's obsession with pop culture. Arguably his best film to date. He didn't direct this movie, Tony Scott did, which notably spares the viewer those awful back and forth scene sequences typical in Tarantino directed films. Major kudos are in order for the casting director; who featured one of the finest casts in movie history, although its standard formula in Tarantino films. True Romance basically puts together a story of true love between two people who won't let any obstacle get in their way, no matter how dire the situation becomes. Its bold and dynamic. Christian Slater is dynamite in the lead role, you can tell he had a lot of fun playing his character. Val Kilmer plays ""Angelic Elvis"" who provides a small dose of good conscience on Slater's shoulder, and Patricia Arquette co-stars as the love of his life. Has all the familiar faces: Dennis Hopper, Christopher Walken, Brad Pitt, Gary Oldman, James Gandolfini, Chris Penn, Tom Sizemore, Victor Argo, among others. The confrontation scene between Hopper and Walken is a must-see highlight! The gunfight at the end and the prelude that leads up to it is non-stop drama and excitement. Movie is worth multiple looks, if not for just the memorable scenes by themselves.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Arquette shines,"What a wonderful performance by the lovely Patricia Arquette.

People view the violence in this film as over the top, at least for 1993. if you are going to be offended by this movie, then you may as well be offended by all movies with violence. And congrats to Arquette for her Emmy winning performance in ""Medium"", where she has also been nominated for a Golden Globe, SAG, and Golden Satellite award!",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

Quarantino is not the best writter and likes blood to much, is not a movie for everybody, I should add that has too many bullets and could have been done much better with less blood and violence, but is Quarantino, this also give me an excuse to look for better movies and choose more carefully.

"Oh my gosh, the perfect film??","Pulp Fiction remains my favourite film and is the bench mark that i judge all other films against ever but when you realise that the format for True Romance was the same and that it was Tony Scott who changed it to a linear format,then this could have been the perfect film. Having said that, it still remains one of the few films that i could watch at least once a week forever.Listening to QTs commentary on the 2 disc set, and the problems he had getting the film off the ground,it seems inconceivable that this film very nearly slipped away.Every time i watch this film, i always wish that i hadn't seen it and that this was the first time!! I rate it that highly.The razor sharp, snappy trademark QT dialogue, the music, the characters and the attention given to establish each one,the intricate build up to the final Mexican stand off,the music, even the ending(and here you have a choice!)Just reading the list of actors involved, Hopper,Jackson, Walken,Pitt, Kilmer, Slater,Arquette,(yeah, cistern lids don't break when you belt someone over the head with them! )Sizemore, Penn (sadly missed),etc says quality. And this,a first screen play?? A hidden gem, a cult movie?Shout it from the rooftops, this film is that good, and the whole world needs to know. It would be perfect if the deleted scenes could be inserted into their true position.This film never got the credit it deserved and still remains a classic amongst film goers who know their stuff.

An Entertaining Love Story,"True Romance (Tarantino's first script put to film) is a highly entertaining love story. It centers around two characters named Clarence and Alabama who fall in love on their first meeting. The catch is this, Alabama is a call girl hired to have sex with Clarence on his birthday. Of course, she falls in love with him and Clarence returns her feelings. Trouble with this scenario is that Alabama still has a pimp that wants her back to business. Clarence decides he needs to do something about it, like kill him. When he goes to retrieve her lugauge, he accidentally gets a suitcase full of cocaine that he decides he needs to sell. All hell breaks lose from this point on due to the fact that the owner of the cocaine would like it back.Tarantino writes a winner. The story is fast paced and keeps the viewer tuned in. A lot of good lines are found in the script. Most importantly however, the viewer is not left scratching his head at the end. It ties together well.True Romance has an all-star cast with stand out performances by Christian Slater, Dennis Hopper, and Bronson Pinchot. If your a movie goer that sees movies for performances, True Romance is perfect for you.Enjoy! 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
True Romance True Brilliance,"""Sicilians are great liars. The best in the world. I'm Sicilian. My father was the world heavy-weight champion of Sicilian liars. From growing up with him I learned the pantomime. There are seventeen different things a guy can do when he lies to give himself away. A guys got seventeen pantomimes. A woman's got twenty, but a guy's got seventeen... but, if you know them, like you know your own face, they beat lie detectors all to hell. Now, what we got here is a little game of show and tell. You don't wanna show me nothing', but you're tellin me everything. I know you know where they are, so tell me before I do some damage you won't walk away from.""The above dialogue is said by Christopher Walken (Vincenzo Coccotti) in what , in my opinion is one of the greatest scenes in modern cinema.The verbal sparring between Walken and Hopper is one of the reasons why i love movies so much, so thanks guys!It's been far too long since i watched this film , 15 years to be precise , and thanks to a little bit of self indulgence i have re equanted myself with the film that is ""True Romance"".Clarence Worley is a well-meaning but socially unskilled comic-shop clerk whose idea of a big night out is catching a Sonny Chiba triple-feature at a downtown grindhouse. Clarence is celebrating his birthday in just such a manner when he meets a beautiful girl named Alabama , and it's love at first sight for both of them.Clarence's enthusiasm isn't dampened much when he discovers Alabama is actually a prostitute who was paid by his boss to bump into him; she's only been in the business for a few days, and is more than eager to give up streetwalking to be with Clarence. However, Alabama is certain her pimp, Drexl ,will not be happy; he's an ill-mannered sort with mob connections and a fondness for violence.Chivalrous Clarence offers to break the news to Drexl and collect her belongings, but he doesn't tell her he also plans to kill Drexl while he's there; a melee breaks out that leaves Drexl and his henchmen dead. Clarence grabs a suitcase that he thinks contains Alabama's clothes, but he discovers it instead holds five million dollars' worth of cocaine. The couple hits the road for California, planning to sell the dope and enjoy the good life in South America with the proceeds, but soon a group of very unhappy underworld characters are after them, as well as the police.It's a rare thing that a group of actors are on top of their game , all at the same time in the same film but when it does happen , you get a film like True Romance. In my opinion Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette are perfect in roles as Clarence and Alabama . Slater oozes charm and Arquette could make any man fall on love with her . I think that these two actors put in the best performances of their careers. ( i cant think of anything they have done since that is as good.) .Christopher Walken makes the best ten minute cameo in a film i can think off. he's funny , yet menacing , which in turn has a knock on affect with Dennis Hopper. An actor i don't normally rate that highly , yet in the scenes with Walken he is amazing.There are other good performance from Brad Pitt , Gary Oldman and what looks like a young Tony Soprano from James Gandolfini.Having given all this praise i still think True Romance is far from being perfect. Quentin Tarantino's script is not a polished as we see in later films such as Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction, yet it's undeniably Tarantino . Also i was a little disappointed with the final five minutes of the film especially after THAT monumental shoot up. It's all a bit too ""happy ever after"" for my liking.Never the less this is a classic movie and has a special place in my movie watching heart.9 out of 10",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
"True Tarantino tale, that's volently romantic","It's highly unlikely, we'll ever meet another writer who can match the unique, original, and potent style of dialogue, with sharp, cutting observation such as Tarantino. Not in this lifetime anyhow. Admittedly this was his first movie script, which he drew from his own experiences down at Video Archives. The title here is a killer, where much more is happening than just romance. The names and characters which aren't just drawn from a hat, are loud and interesting, and I'm even talking about the baddies, such as pimp, Drexl Spivey, played with such evil and loathing from the ever versatile Gary Oldman. His demise is one of the most shockingly violent moments in Tarantino history, as was the scene with cutie pie Alabama Whitman (a perfectly splendid Arquette) enduring a hell of a bashing by mobster, Virgil (the late great Gandofini) in that motel suite, one of the strongest cinematic moments, I've craved revenge. When seeing it back in 94, two women behind me went off at that scene violence. Remember you've walked into a film penned by Tarantino, where like Dogs, generated the same kind of violence. He's set a new standard. Believe it or not too, both these films are more violent than Pulp Fiction. The violence here is nasty, and bites. As a follow up to Dogs, Tarantino couldn't cut it more perfect, where as Tarantino films, there's a lot of similarities. As you know he retains some of the same names, surnames, dialogue quotes, and insignificant close up shots of coffee cups and ten minute commentary on things like songs, franchises, and how restaurants hardly get held up. The dialogue springs to life from the very go, as Slater plays an unbalanced Elvis idol, junk food eating, comic reading, trigger finger loner, Clarence Worley and he does it, in one of his best ever performances, where it's still up there, in spite of every other movie he's done. He's set up on a blind date with Alabama, an prostitute new to the game, who accidentally falls in love, creating a manifold of mayhem, when Clarence tries to square things with Drexl, where things of course, don't go as planned. When retrieving Alabama's case from the very dead Drexl, he takes the wrong one. It's full of Coke. So, Clarence and Alabama take off to L.A, to sell it with a contact friend of his, the mobsters and that in tow. Hopper's performance, as Worley's gentle cop father, was a nice change of fine role, where of course I loved Walken as the main mobster baddie, who doesn't take kindly to racial insults. The Q and A caravan torture scene was one of the best scenes in the flick. And the shootout in the motel room near the end, again as a similarity, all so reminded me of the Mexican standoff in Dogs. But this guys got style and knows how to make movies exciting, and this two hour pic is a perfect example of that. I was more for these films, than his later ones, which gets MA ratings instead of R's. True Romance is one of his most explosively violent films ever, and like I said earlier it bites.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Great Quentin T Script,"The Christopher Walken Dennis Hopper Scene was a 10 best all time scene. Those two great actors had never appeared in a film together before. They worked together again in 1995's SEARCH and DESTROY but there was no way to recapture the magic of TR's pivotal trailer scene. Maybe someday someone will write a movie that has Hopper,Walken,Oldman,Guy Pierce, Christian Bale,Michael Caine,Gene Hackman,and Tommy Lee Jones. Now that would be a cast. Batman Begins did have four of the above. And fans of the film P.C.U. know that Caine and Hackman appeared in A BRIDGE TOO FAR together, creating the basis for a character's doctoral thesis.

"Amazing Movie, but not like Tarantino's others.","I'm a fanatic of Quentin Tarantino's work, and when I saw True Romance, his name was painted (or should I say splattered?) all over it. He wrote the screenplay, and I thought it was great. But one thing did bother me. I like Tony Scott's style and frenetic camera changes, but this isn't the movie to do it in. This is the type of film that needed to be seen in a non-linear look (ala Reservoir Dogs), in order to get its full understanding.Not to bang on Scott's shot.....It's kind of mixed for me. I love Tarantino's awesome storytelling techniques, but I also Love Tony Scott's action-esque directing. If both had been mixed, this movie could have been so much more.Now don't get me wrong on this: This is by far one of my top 20 favorite movies of all-time, but it seemed a bit too run-of-the-mill in direction. But all its flaws are healed by an amazing script, and it's so farfetched that it's fun to watch.It's good to see a movie once in a while that says ""Screw oscar winning titles, and give me a movie the action fan dreams of"". This movie was great, and I really enjoyed it, but not a latch-on title like Tarantino's masterpiece, Pulp Fiction.By the way, I saw this movie on its 1997 DVD release.

The Ultimate Hollywood Fairytale,"The Ultimate Hollywood FairytaleA script that was (party) written by Quentin Tarantino seems to be impossible to get on film. Nevertheless, Tony Scott took a shot and delivers the fairytale about ""the movies"". After some modifications in the storyline (which was originally connected to Tarantino's Reservoir Dogs), Scott and co. produced a true classic.Leading character Clarence Worley (Slater) guides you during a wild ride, which contains literally sex, drugs and rock and roll. Basically, the story is about Clarence who meets Alabama (Arquette), a callgirl, falls in love with her and attempts to start a new life with her. However, there are some complications concerning her pimp, Drexl (Oldman). Clarence and Alabama end up stealing cocaine from Alabama's former pimp. The newlyweds decide to sell the drugs in Hollywood, finding themselves chased by the former owners of the ""half a mill"" worth of drugs.True Romance is a film that should be regarded as the guide through Hollywood. The incredible strong cast (with appearances of, amongst others, Samuel L. Jackson, Brad Pitt, Christopher Walken, James Gandolfini and Dennis Hopper) delivers the most comic, over exaggerated, varying and creative characters imaginable. Literally every part of this movie is overdone; from the Elvis impression by Kilmer, to the stereotype director Donowitz (Rubinek). Why then, do I rate this movie with 8 points out of the 10 possible? Simply because in this movie the interaction between the actors in every scene is just fantastic, which truly is the engine of the picture. Above that, the dialogues are brilliant, and you will find yourself laughing out loud on more than 1 occasion. Most of the times it is not a good sign when you are laughing out loud during serious dialogues in an action-filled motion picture. This is not the case for True Romance. Scott displays the action fairytale in which everything is possible. The choice of exaggerating every character and scene turns out to be the magic touch that turns this movie in to a classic.Although the entire movie keeps you on the edge of your seat, the scene where Walken, playing a mobster, visits Clarence's father, Hopper, is the very best part of this picture. During this scene, which contains of more than 10 minutes of dialogue, you are blown away by the actors' performance, their lines, character and appearance. In this scene, Gandolfini also displays his talent of playing a fearless gangster.True Romance provides an adrenaline rush, which does not stop until the very end. Referring to Gandolfini's character, watching this movie truly feels like tasting the snow at the end of the rainbow. Hollywood's rainbow, that is.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

All I want to know is..where has she been hiding all these years? It seems that her resume is short and unimpressive. She deserves better. And just to watch James (Tony Soprano) Gandolfini do his violent thing, was worth the price of admission in itself. True Romance is miles ahead of Pulp Fiction.

A fantastic action romp and a modern day romeo and Juliet,"TRUE ROMANCE:Director: Tony Scott Cast: Christian Slater, Patricia Arquette, Dennis Hopper, Christopher Walken, Val Kilmer, Gary Oldman, Samuel L. Jackson, Brad Pitt Genre: Action, Thriller Certificate: 18 Released: 1993This criminally under-appreciated cult classic is a true masterpiece that deserves to be watched by everyone! From the ridiculously strong casting to the excellent script (written by none other than Quentin Tarintino), almost everything about this movie is stylish, cool and near perfection.As I fore mentioned above, the cast is full of some of the best actors in the business. Christian Slater is in top form as Clarence, a loser working in a comic store who comes across the opportunity of a life time when he and his newlywed wife, Alabama (Patricia Arquette) come across a suitcase of uncut cocaine. They begin their road trip, setting off to sell the lot to a rich client and living off it for the rest of their lives.All is not as easy at is seems, though. Upon their travel they get tracked down by a gang of Sicilian mobsters (led by Christopher Walken) who were the original owners of the cocaine. What follows is a high octane, super stylish chase full of moments of laughter, breathlessness and shock, including one of the most infamous speeches in cinematic history delivered by Dennis ""your grandmother f****d a n*****"" Hopper.What should also be noted is the quality of directing. The action comes thick and fast with numerous gunfights breaking up the story including the breathtaking finalé proving an obvious highlight and also the shocking scene where Alabama gets beaten to within an inch of her life by one of the Sicilians mobsters. Moments like this are so brilliantly choreographed that it brings out the deepest of emotions from you.All in all this is a movie that simply must be seen as soon as possible.

Christina Slater and P.Arquette do a good job, but Dennis Hopper is superb in the scene with C. Walken. The eggplant dialogue is in my opinion one of the best movie quotes ever. It also has some really good violence scenes in wich the action look very real (if you like that like i do, it's your movie). Much better than Pulp Fiction",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Check it out,"One can easily see the Tarantino influence in this film, with the stylized violence, the amoral/heroic characters, and the fixation on using the word ""nigger."" It's a pretty good script, but I think taking out of linear time, ""Pulp Fiction""-style would have been a mistake. The cast collected for this film was awesome. Samuel L. Jackson in a very small part, almost a cameo. Dennis Hopper was tremendous in his last scene, as was Christopher Walken. Even James Gandolfini, who would have been relatively unknown then, put in a very good turn. Much of the rest of the supporting cast was also excellent, with the possible exception of Gary Oldman, who went just a little far over the top. Now, Christain Slater is a pretty good actor, and I've enjoyed some of his stuff. For that matter I enjoyed this one. But with these giants in the cast, Slater fairly obviously comes up short. And mention must be made of Patricia Arquette, who more or less stole the show. Her portrayal of Alabama's defiance in the scene with Gandolfini should be a cinematic classic. If you can stand the violence and profanity, I recommend checking this one out.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Tony Scott's greatest achievement to date!,"True Romance is just one of those movies that has a knack of representing all the negative points about society in the most beautiful way. I mean who would have thought murder would lead to being the most romantic thing in the world? I suppose the thing I love the most about this movie is its ability to make you happy and give you that essential feel good factor. I love how Christian Slater was put in the leading role - I don't think I could imagine anyone else with so much energy and charisma. Its also refreshing to see him in a leading role as he is usually a supporting character.And as for the supporting cast - so many amazing cinematic achievements in one film! Christopher Walken is scarier than I've seen him for like, well, ever! Dennis Hopper's last speech is actually beautiful. Val Kilmer pops up there somewhere too - but I'm not spoiling that for you. And just what was Brad Pitt thinking? Obviously he was still in his Kalifornia role when he signed up for the ride. Enjoy my 4th favorite film of all time",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Great movie Quentin style...,"This is a little gem of a movie, and is lesser known than many of Quentin Tarantino's other efforts.  There's alot to like here, from the great script to the acting performances of all the key players.  The best scene in the film is the one with Hopper and Walken... Very stong dialogue and acting in that scene makes it one of the great scenes in cinema history.  If you want your movies to have ample servings of action, great screenwriting, marvelous acting, with a little romance thrown in, check this movie out.  It happens to be a personal favorite of mine, and will deliver the goods if you give it the good college try.Rating     10/10  superb",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
An underrated film with an terrific Quentin Tarantino script.,"A young man by the name of Clerence (Christian Slater) gets to meet a bright wide-eyed prostitute named Alabama (Patricia Arquette) falls in love at first sight and then they get married.

Nuts and Loving it!,"Stealing, Cheating, Killing. Who said romance is dead? 'True Romance' is a nut case film, in fact, it loves to be one. Quentin Tarantino, who is the official writer of this film, and Tony Scott, who has officially directed this film, were on one trip while making this flick!'True Romance' is about a newly married couple who screw up big time and get involved with the very wrong guys. The film begins very well, the first 30-40 minutes are interesting and absorbing. But! As soon as the film shows it's real colors, it falls on it's face. Also, the goings-on get too violent and gory, which puts you off completely. More over, the culmination is also a downer. The impact clearly seems missing!Quentin Tarantino is my favorite filmmaker, I am a huge fan of his. But, I have no option here, but to say this popular faze: When The Mighty Fell! Same goes for Tony Scott.In the acting department, 'True Romance' gets an ensemble cast, and there are some note-worthy performances. Christian Slater is excellent. Patricia Arquette looks each bit of the character and performs well. Michael Rapaport hams. Christopher Walken & Gary Oldman prove their caliber, yet again. James Gandolfini is fantastic. Late Dennis Hopper is first-rate. Brad Pitt is royally sidelined, and same goes for Val Kilmer.On the whole, 'True Romance' is a major letdown.",4.0,Anonymous,Romance
An Amazing Cast and Script,"This is about as quirky and offbeat as you will find in a movie. I hate too ay they don't make movies like this anymore but they do not. This script, filled with precise and unusual dialogue, was written by Quentin Tarantino before the release of Reservoir Dogs. This is part of the strength of this one. Unlike Quentin's feeling about his script for Natural Born Killers, which he blamed Oliver Stone for ruining, Tarantino liked the late Tony Scott's version of his script. The visuals are all Scott. They lack the thoughtful pace and pauses of a Tarantino directed film; that doesn't mean it isn't good-just not Tarantino. It is fast paced. It is violent. The strength of it is also its actors. Slater is at his best. Arquette is lovable. Oldman's politically incorrect and crazy performance is one for the books. Dennis Hopper is Dennis Hopper, and that is never bad. Add a young Michael Rappaport and Brad Pitt. James Gandolfini too. Blink and you'll miss a younger Samuel L. Jackson. Christopher Walken is at the top of his game. Look out for Chris Penn and Tom Sizemore as a pair of cops. This film is a winner and holds up more than 20 years later. The Sonny Chiba, the Elvis, the music love that the script is saturated with are all more enjoyable when you learn Tarantino is the author.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Exciting, sexy crime thriller with top-notch Tarantino script.","Clarence: I always said, if I had to f*ck a guy... I mean had to, if my life depended on it... I'd f*ck Elvis.Exciting, sexy, enjoyable crime thriller with great and great-looking stars is one of my favourite Tarantino scripts. Sparkling pop-culture dialogue, great characters, great scenes (check the one between Dennis Hopper and Christopher Walken, Gary Oldman's gem of a scene, Brad Pitt's just lying there on the couch, the classic movie theatre scene where Clarence and Alabama meet, followed by the just as classic diner scene).Has a great sense of humour - the pervasive joke is every reaction you think Alabama will have to the various stupid things Clarence does, she has the opposite. Violence is true romance - sick? Perhaps. Its the one thing Tony Scott and Tarantino agree on: unnecessary violence is not cheap exploitation, its entertainment. I personally think the shock effects Tarantino uses to structure his screenplays are quite gimmicky and undergraduate. Quality does not always mean sudden shifts of sex and violence. Surprise is not always good. I could have done without the hotel room scene, for example, where Alabama has a near-deadly encounter with a hit-man. One of the most violent things i've ever seen.Nevertheless, if you skip these scenes, its a compulsively enjoyable ride, and one of Tony Scott's least offensive films (Top Gun is sheer obnoxiousness today).8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
You're an eggplant!,"There's so many great things here to say that it's hard to know where to start! Quentin Tarantino is the writer that's always a great foundation. There is an all star cast lead by Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette in their career best performances. Dennis Hopper (Easy Rider, Speed) and Christopher Walken (The Deer Hunter, Dogs Of War) eat up their 10 minutes of screen time in the greatest psychological confrontation in movie history. Val Kilmer (Top Secret), Chris Penn (Reservoir Dogs), Brad Pitt (12 Monkeys, Interveiw With A Vampire), Samuel L Jackson (Pulp Fiction, Jurassic Park), Michael Rappaport (Higher Learning), Tom Sizemore (Natural Born Killers), Gary Oldman (The Professional) and Bronson Pinchot all throw out some of the best performances in their careers into tiny parts. A simply stuuning Mexican stand-off and shoot out towards the end is one of the best gun fights in movie history. Great writing produces many, many memorable lines. Confrontations between Christian Slater and Gary Oldman, Patricia Arquette and James Gandolfini, and Brad Pitt vs anybody produce classic scene after classic scene. A great soundtrack, great story, and great cinematography boost this movie even higher. Plus trademark Tarantino style pop-culture references give it even more appeal. This movie is awesome.

Great Movie,"I love this movie and it is one of my all time favorites!! It has an outstanding cast..Look for James Gandolfini in one of his earlier roles. I love the scene with him and Patricia Arquette, although it may be a little unsettling and hard for some people to watch. I also enjoy watching Brad Pitt in this movie. He has a small part in this movie but he does bring humor to his role. Gary Oldman is truly creepy as a pimp and really makes you not like him at all. This is a movie that shows what happens when people meet the right person for them, and that you can forget about your past and become a happier person. ALthough it starts out with less than perfect circumstances it is a feel good film that shows you love is all you need.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
ONE OF THE BETTER Tarantino,"Since ""Pulp Fiction"" has become such a huge success, the film industry thought it was cool to pen down the name of Tarantino even if he was involved for 5 seconds or less, but this gem is one of the sweet exceptions. It's like the Tarantino-movie Quentin never made as this movie goes down the screen with a very high speed. Clarence (an incredible Christian Slater) is a kind of weirdo who lives in his own dreamworld (he even has Elvis as an imaginary friend) whose life got tumbled up when his colleagues give him a hooker as a present. Clarence first can't believe that Alabama (Patricia Arquette in her best role ever) is the girl of his dreams, she even, likes obscure kung fu-movies but when he finds out that she's a hooker, he decides to show what real love stands for and kills her pimp so they can start a whole new life. The sole thing is that instead of a bag of clothes, Clarence came home with a bag of cocaine. A real cat and mouse play starts with some incredible small roles (Dennis Hopper, James Gandolfini, Samuel L Jackson and an unrecognizable Brad Pitt).",4.0,Anonymous,Romance
Good script under a very precise direction and a deep consistency of the actors.,"What can you expect when watching Quentin Tarantino's participation in any level of a movie? Violence in a right level, emotion, great actors participation, and more and more and much more. I can only accept good comments on this movie, because it is possible to find out several positive aspects we look for when watching a movie... You can smile, cry, learn, be tense, be happy... Just to highlight some good moments, I would briefly describe the scene of the conversation between Dennis Hopper (Christian's father) and Christopher Walken (gangster)when you can learn about history of South Europe civilization and in the same time can realize the very romantic and funny way found by Dennis to face his death (He gave to Christopher the explanation of South Italians have dark hairs). Also, how deep can go a dream of a person who has a pure love by his fan, and knew all the time how to use this dream to take him into the real world (This is Christian love by Elvis - his mentor all the time). This is a example of a movie you can really have a good fun!!! Congratulations to Tony Scott and Quentin as well.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

Pick Up Some Beer....... And Some Cleaning Products,"Tarantino. With all the Elvis freaks in this world how brilliant is it to write a screenplay where your main character summons The King whenever he needs advice? True Romance is one of those best kept secret type movies. There is no way The Accademy would honor a movie with such gratuitous violence with an Oscar.The best way for me to describe this movie? Whenever I meet a fan of the cinema and we start discussing what we consider to be ""the greats"" I get excited, hell I get jittery when I learn that this person HASN'T seen True Romance. Why? Because I remember what it was like viewing this movie for the first time, expecting nothing, yet being totally in awe while watching True Romance for the first time. I get excited because I know that when I insist that THIS be the next movie this person watches, they too will soon be enlightened.While Tarantino should receive credit for knocking out an incredibly original screenplay, it's the cast that makes this movie so special. No one tries to steal the show. No one tries to make it ""their"" movie. Believe it or not, there are times in Hollywood when an ensemble cast so special is assembled that the end result truly is magic. This is one of those times.The big scene, of course, occurs between Dennis Hopper and Christopher Walken. A scene that True Romance is known for. But standing toe to toe with these two Hollywood veterans are actors like Bronson Pinchot (yes I said Bronson Pinchot), Michael Rapaport, Brad Pitt (responsible for the summary title), Patricia Arquette, Tom Sizemore and Saul Rubinek.There isn't a dead spot in this flick. It flows perfectly. It's safe to say that most of the characters are unlikeable, yet we love them all.For me to describe the plot would be pointless. It's a waste of time. This is the type of movie where, even though the plot is superior, it doesn't matter because this is a movie made for people who love movies.If you haven't seen True Romance, do yourself a favor and BUY it. I am getting jittery already.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Racism and Elvis,"Think about this movie as a series of skits with the most prolific/clichéd actors of the early 1990s and you'll come to appreciate its worth on a whole new level. True Romance is an SNL skit gone serious. Plus, there's enough latent racism to cover three Andrew Dice Clay monologues (though we all know that Dice was being ironic, but that's another discussion). In conclusion, any time Christopher Walkenand Dennis Hopper share the screen you can't go wrong. It's like coke and girls with low self-esteem.In addition, Val Kilmer plays an unseen Elvis, Michael Rappaport is his normal goofy white boy/wigger and in the history of cinema Brad Pitt does more with three lines than any other untalented actor with great bone structure, ever. To top it all off, the soundtrack kicks my ass and everyone's ass I've ever met.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"this film still defines ""love story"" to me","I was 22 when this film was released, and I remember it was autumn, it rained a lot, it was cold. I remember walking out enlightened, and I also remember going to see the film again, on the next day.Nothing much has changed, I can still watch this film on consecutive days and always get incredible kicks out of it. I like to say it has the best love story in it, cause I despise the ""regular"" love stories so much. Sure, it's over-the-top and cartoon-like... and that's what it makes so great.Everyone knows (or should know, at least) the magical moment of truth with Chris Walken and Dennis Hopper, the way Hopper's character orders a quick bullet in the head with his famous ""Sicilian speech"". This episode alone is one of the highlights of cinema history, period; right up there with Rutger Hauers last dying moments in ""Blade Runner"" or Robert De Niro's you-talking-to-me-speech in ""Taxi Driver"". Hell, I could go on and on praising the acting and utilizing the momentum in this scene.One of my best friends likes to say the film is just a poor sketch off Tarantino's scrapbook and only shines momentarily. I think he needs re-programming, to be honest. Sure, it's got kitschy bits (Alabama's clothes, anyone? Theme music, anyone?), sure the script has a feeling of let's get drunk and write something FUN, and sure it goes off the wall more than once.

Tarantino's 'Romeo and Juliet',"Before Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction came Tarantino's 'other' film. It's not quite as well known (despite sporting an all star cast of A and B-listers) as what came after it, but that doesn't mean it's any the less fun. It might not be as raw as Reservoir Dogs, or as trendy as Pulp Fiction - you could even say it's more of a 'mainstream' gangster flick.It's about a pair of lovable rogues who steal cocaine from someone they really shouldn't, then go on a joyride to Hollywood to sell it. It's fair to say that, along the way, they meet plenty of people who want to put a damper on their plans (or simply just murder them horribly).As I mentioned, there's an all star cast, so expect one great performance after the other. Of course, being written by Tarantino, don't expect him to go easy on the language or violence. Some scenes may require a strong stomach to watch.If you like gangster films then this one has to be on your list - it'll give you everything you want: great actors, snappy dialogue, violence, double-crossing and maybe even a little bit of romance.

"Early Tarantino at its core, this is an unforgettable ""Romance.""","""True Romance"" blossoms on a lot of levels, but it most distinctively bears the mark of an early Quentin Tarantino film. The scene dynamics and the way it plays beautifully in and out of turning points are all early signs of the would-be master at work. Released the year between ""Resevoir Dogs"" and ""Pulp Fiction,"" ""True Romance"" doesn't carry his directorial signature, but it reeks of Tarantino in all the right ways and compares favorably with those two early '90s crime thrillers.The replay value of ""True Romance"" dwells in how its bounty of supporting actors all went on to outdo its two stars. Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette play Clarence and Alabama, a couple who meet because Alabama was a call girl hired to sleep with Clarence as a birthday present. They fall in love and marry instantly. To put the past behind them, Clarence visits her pimp (Gary Oldman -- that's awesome supporting role number one), kills him and makes off with a half million in coke.Hunting the runaway couple are agents of a mob boss played in one 100 percent Tarantino scene by Christopher Walken and later by James Gandolfini in a breakout performance. Brad Pitt, who worked with director Tony Scott's brother Ridley as an unknown just two years before in another fugitive film, ""Thelma & Louise,"" plays the unassuming stoner roommate of Clarence's best friend (played by comedian Michael Rapaport). Other notables are brief appearances from Samuel L. Jackson and Val Kilmer, as well as Dennis Hopper's as Clarence's father.Even with this ""secret"" knowledge, this dynamic works for this story, one that attempts to broaden one's definition of love to include murder, running from the law and flat out acting nuts. Clarence and Alabama are unconventional and completely stupid, deserving of losing everything, but in front of a backdrop of characters who define true moral scumminess, it becomes easy to root for them.Scott certainly helped create the suspense necessary for a dialog-heavy Tarantino script and that warrants applause, but Quentin simply owns this picture at its core. Hopper's ""history lesson"" where he laughs in Walken's face as he refers to his ancestors as a racial epithet showcase Tarantino's classic tension-twisting. The way a scene's momentum shifts at the drop of a hat and climaxes into pure mayhem captures his utter brilliance.The characters spanning a wide array of vivid strangeness and the sheer untamable wildness of the story and events make ""True Romance"" hard to forget.~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

After killing him, he goes to his father(Hopper) for help and meets a lot of interesting side characters. Great dialogue and dark humorous violence mix together to make this film. Also making up this film are the cameos by Samuel L. jackson, Val Kilmer and comic relief cameo Brad Pitt as Floyd the druggie roommate. SOme scenes let the violence take control, which are the worst scenes, but there aren't that many scenes like that. The film includes the breakthrough performance for Michael Rapaport as Dick Ritchie.

This is really Tarantino's best and I loved his other movies,"This movie introduces many of today's powerhouse actors and the cast alone is so full of future and current (at the time) stars that it almost can't help but be great. All I will say about the characters is this: watch for Brad Pitt's character, he only has a few minutes, but you won't be disappointed. Also, watch for the scene between Christopher Walken and Dennis Hopper. It may be the best scene in a film that I can remember.The thing that makes it it hard for True Romance to gain the acceptance of other Tarantino's films is that it really is a romance story and most of Tarantino's fans (I assume) are male and are probably not interested and or threatened by watching a ""love story"". However this is romance Tarantino style with violence and blood galore injected with appropriately timed humor. But like all good movie dramas an attachment to the characters is vital to the emotional impact of the movie and it is the love story in this that makes every gun fight, torture, or death that much more interesting, meaningful, and powerful.If you like other Tarantino movies see this one, you will definitely like it.

Not really good,"True Romance is a not really good. It wallows in every possible seedy contrivance of American crime/action cinema. It is absolutely shameless in its exploitation of excessive violence, over-acting, melodrama, lurid sex, and rampant drug use...I love it. Quentin Tarantino, as I'm sure everyone knows, wrote the story, but it is the in execution that this film pays off. The cast, oh the cast: The lynchpins are Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette. They both give solid performances, which prevents the film from flying off the tracks; they serve as the pilot light. The supporting roles are the gas. The Walken/Hopper show down has been oft sighted as the film's best aspect, and this is, arguably, true. Just watch this scene and then watch it again. Sparks actually shoot out of the screen and burn people about the head and shoulders. OK, you've got Val Kilmer as the ghost of Elvis, Brad Pitt as a disgruntled pot-smoking loser, Tom Sizemore & Chris Penn as cops, James Gandolfini (pre-Sopranos) as a reflective hit-man, and you've even got Bronson Pinchot (from TV's PERFECT STRANGERS) for God's sake. Did I forget Gary Oldman? Do yourself a favor and rent every single Gary Oldman related project (they're not all good films, but...). Why is Gary Oldman not in every film ever made? Why? I ask you why? He has got to be the best actor working today, hands down. As Drexel Spivey, Oldman chews the scenery, digests it, and then expels it from every orifice. Keep in mind that he is an English actor with a normal speaking voice at home in the Royal Shakespeare Company. His performance here is second only to his turn in LEON in blatant over-the-top insanity. Tony Scott, who along with his brother Ridley, has been known to over-direct a film or two, here chooses wisely to basically set up the camera and run. The score by Hans Zimmer adds a bouncy xylophone driven theme to the film and finds the right balance. This a well made, balls-to-the-wall, popcorn throwing, cult classic. In a market dominated with stereotypical characters, this movie avoids that trap by letting the stereotypes flourish with all the grotesque absurdity it can muster. 9/10",3.0,Anonymous,Romance

This movie is in my top 10 favorites,"Tony Scott did an great job directing this fine film, But all credit must go to Quentin Tarantino he wrote one heck of a script. I know this was one of Tarantino's first scripts, but it could be one of his best. I can understand that at the time Tarantino didn't have enough to budget or get this film off the ground. He did a good move in giving the script to Scott. Scott knows what to do when it comes to movies and i know he let Tarantino make the movie almost like a partner. All of the characters were well thought up and deep. Walken has a great role as does Hopper. Drexel could be one of the best villains of all time. This is one of the 3 movies that all tie in to each other in Quentin's mind. This, Resevoir Dogs, and Pulp Fiction are all connected. With Vincent and Vic being brothers and Mr. White and Alabama being lovers/partners in crime this shows yet another way Quentin is one hell of a script writer. I know the ending is not as Quentin dreamed up, but there is a good viewing of his ending in the Directors cut of this movie. The movie has everything you want. Thrills, Kills, and blood Spills. The movie is also a love story in a true Quentin T. fashion. This movie is probably my favorite movie of all time. its a 10 of 10.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Tony Scott's Best,"True Romance is Tony Scott's best film. This was my favorite movie in 1994. The film was written by Quentin Tarantino. It is better to get the unrated version than the R rated version. This film was cut to avoid an NC-17 rating. The first time I saw this movie I liked it. Christian Slater does a good job as Clerance Woorly, Patricia Arquette does a good job as Alabama, Val Kilmer does a good as the mentor and Dennis Hopper does a good job as Clerance's father. This is a fun movie to watch. This is Quentin Tarantino's best script. Pulp Fiction is currently my favorite movie. At High School I told the whole class that True Romance is my favorite movie but no one heard of it before and I was surprised.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
I got a great package,"This film has it all violence, humor, love, and even a little heart. Slater was quoted as saying that he was most proud of this film, and rightfully so.

The whole is less than the sum of its parts,"True Romance is a film that, on paper, has everything going for it - Quentin Tarantino's sharp dialogue, a stellar cast, and music by Hans Zimmer. However, despite these promising elements, the movie doesn't quite come together as a cohesive whole.The story presents an interesting contrast between its initial setup and conclusion, but the overall narrative feels disjointed. While many individual scenes are memorable, they seem stitched together without building into something greater. The pacing and transitions lack the fluidity needed to create a truly captivating experience.The performances, however, are top-notch. Gary Oldman, Christopher Walken, and James Gandolfini deliver standout moments with Tarantino's signature dialogue. These performances elevate the film even when the direction and camera work occasionally falter.One surprising misstep is Hans Zimmer's score. While he's known for enhancing films with his music, here it feels out of place and even distracting at times.In the end, True Romance is a rare case where the whole is less than the sum of its parts. It will appeal to die-hard Tarantino fans for its dialogue and performances but may leave others feeling underwhelmed by its lack of narrative cohesion.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance
Not a bad Story!!,"Dear Arm Chair Critics,The Story is not a bad yarn, I actually enjoyed it,especially Patrica Arquettes performance,..her rather erotic goodbye kiss to her new daddy in law,made me wince with embarrassment,also her gutsy encounter with the henchman in the Motel whilst the boyfriend was out getting Pizza...Wow did that girl have BALLS.I had to mention those 2 scenes,in my opinion that were worth mentioning. out of 10 definitely a good 6!",,Anonymous,Romance
"Tarantino's best script, one of the best casts ever","Go to the main details page for this film. Then look at the cast. Have you ever seen a better group of actors in one place? I know Christian Slater doesn't have a rep as a great actor, but in this film he is. He stands out above everyone else, and that is high praise indeed when you're comparing him to the likes of Christopher Walken and Dennis Hopper. Actually, speaking of Hopper and Walken, they share one scene together, and it is one of the best I have ever scene. I say this with no exaggeration. It's impossible to look away from. The film is worth watching just for this scene.Christian Slater's character is cool. He works in a comic-book store, has a fixation with Elvis Presley, and on his birthday every year he goes to the cinema alone to watch a Martial Arts Triple Bill. Not exactly a standard definition of cool. But he is. He's the sort of character you'd like to be. I can't work out why though, but he's great.I'm not sure what else I can say about this film. I try to be a harsh marker of films, so I only give films that I think are literally perfect 10/10. Which means that only Shawshank Redemption, the Usual Suspects and Return of the King are rated as a 10 by me. But honestly, this film is as good as any of them*. You have to see this movie.*Except for the Shawshank Redemption. That film deserves about 17/10.

Absolutely MUST SEE classic,"This movie is driven by a great story , an almost Cinderella like romance surrounded by brutal violence. The musical score is fabulous and the acting terrific. This movie will forever be a cult classic if only because of a scene between Dennis Hopper and Christopher Walken which only Quenten Tarrantino could write...I say no more--- Patricia Arquette is wonderful in this movie with Christian Slater. It is easily their best movies - they look good together in this preposterous wonderful ride ----and there is another classic hilarious scene with Brad Pitt which alone is worth the 'price of admission' You will have no idea as to what will happen next in this movie, a violent comic romantic fantasy ==I'd give the movie a 10 but the movie is only a great movie to see and watch --it is not a serious movie but who needs serious- it's a very big small movie and that's just fine",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

great film,"This movie proves, once again, that Mr. Tarantino is a great filmwriter. His dialogues are simply magnificent. I've also never seen a film that combines real violence and pure romance in such a touching way as this movie does. The acting was also really good, certainly when you consider that this is, after all, an action movie.  Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette aren't bad, but the real stars are the supporting actors.  Just see the scene with Dennis Hopper and Christopher Walken or the performance of a dreadlocked Gary Oldman, and you will understand what I mean. And then there is the music.  Great music.  Especially the 'exotic Christmassong' that frequently comes back, is used in an excellent way. I've already seen this film three times and it still isn't boring.

An poorly written but well acted film.,"Some of this film is very good, some is very bad.The opening 10-15 minutes are awful with Slater being annoying and talk of Elvis being boring. There are a few more awful bits throughout, mostly those where just Slater and Arquette are on the screen with no one else to distract us from their awful dialogue.The action scenes are stylish and well done, the acting is excellent as you would expect from such a top notch cast.This is less of a film and more a collection of scenes some of which are good, some of which are bad, some are violent and some are funny. The problem is that the bad scenes are really bad with awful dialogue making you cringe and that is too big a handicap for the good scenes to overcome.",3.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Romantic-comedy, Tarantino-style","This film was made from one of the first scripts that Quentin Tarantino wrote, while he was still working as a clerk in a video shop.  It's hard not to detect at least an element of wish fulfillment in this tale of a lonely, Elvis-obsessed comic-book shop clerk who finds love with a beautiful call-girl.While not among his best, the script by Tarantino still amuses with plenty of his usual banter about movies, comics and other aspects of popular culture.  The direction, by Tony Scott is slick and flashy, and the parts are well-played by a great cast (Gary Oldman, Dennis Hopper, Brad Pitt. Samuel L Jackson and Christopher Walken are among the great actors with cameos in this film).One of the main problems of the film is that it is very derivative (particularly of the 1973 Terrence Malick film ""Badlands"" and ""Bonnie and Clyde"").  Having said that, ""True Romance"" is still a very entertaining film (although be warned:  the violence is pretty strong).",,Anonymous,Romance
"3 Good Things, 1 Bad Thing about...  True Romance","ONE GOOD THING: Quentin Tarantino's script is so vastly rich in its menagerie of characters and settings, that it becomes virtually epic in its scope. Gary Oldman's pimp, Brad Pitt's stoner, Samuel L. Jackson's drug dealer, Michael Rapaport's actor, and James Gandolfini's mob henchman are just a few of the ""minor characters"" who show up to steal the movie from its stars.ANOTHER GOOD THING: Although many feel this film would have been better if directed by Tarantino, I would disagree. This film falls ideally on the Tony Scott directorial time line, somewhere between his glossy, almost over-polished earlier works (Top Gun and Days Of Thunder) and his rapid/frenetically edited later films (Domino and Man On Fire). Scott did, unfortunately, change the movie's original time structure, which was closer to Tarantino's Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs; but that appears to be a reflection of ""Hollywood Money's"" readiness to accept change, more than Scott's eagerness to meddle.EVEN ANOTHER GOOD THING: Howard Hawks once theorized that a good movie featured three good scenes and no bad ones. This film features, possibly, the greatest scene in modern movie history without a hero narrowly out running a fire ball, nuclear explosion, or ELECTRICITY!!! By placing Cristopher Walken and Dennis Hopper in a smokey house-trailer with Tarantino's dialogue, Tony Scott crafted the most watchable conversation in recent movie memory.ONE BAD THING: Time has not been kind to the film's two lead stars (Slater and Arquette), who have now been reduced to primarily television actors. This, unfortunately, gives perspective viewers/renters/buyers the wrong impression of the movie and it's superior quality level.OVERALL GRADE: A+",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
GREAT MOVIE,"I recommend this movie to anyone who believes in true love and the lengths people with go to find and keep it. True Romance has a superb leading and supporting cast ( Brad Pitt almost steals the show on the couch ). Yes it is a bit obscene at times, but then again so is the everyday world. If the timid can look past the violence to the true meaning of the movie you'll experience an incredible story of family values, friendship, and most of all love. The lengths these two go through to stay together and stay true to each other are very inspiring, and make every person hope they can find someone to share life with. Well as you can tell I liked it so give it a shot and keep an open mind. Don't forget about the moving score by Hans Zimmer.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

Brilliant acting, awesome characters...even the bit players are memorable and entertaining. Definitely a film you'll want to watch more than once to appreciate it completely.Dark humor, but definitely not a ""spoof"" or ""tongue in cheek"" film. Just an amazing combination of an action film, with a complete storyline from beginning to end, and an all out roll on the floor laughing comedy.

Slightly flawed but still good fun,"This is an entertaining crime-flick made from a Tarantino script. It isn't as good as Reservoir Dogs or Pulp Fiction; in fact, it isn't nearly as good as those but it is a good film none-the-less.This movie contains all of the usual Tarantino style dialogue  pop cultural references, un-PC stuff, funny one-liners, etc. And it has to be said, it is one of True Romance's strong-points. That and the acting; this film really does have a very good cast. There are excellent turns by Gary Oldman, Dennis Hopper, Christopher Walken, Chris Penn, Bronson Pinchot, Brad Pitt and Saul Rubinek. Every one of these actors really makes the most of their screen time. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said of the two central players. Christian Slater is unconvincing, although his character isn't exactly the most convincing Tarantino creation  a comic book assistant who instantly turns into a gun-toting, unhinged madman? Come on now! And Patricia Arquette, despite being incredibly sexy, comes across as just a little too gigglingly moronic most of the time. Generally speaking, the romance aspect of this film was really trite and unengaging. These weren't great characters to hang the story onto to be perfectly honest.But all of that aside, the rest of the film is very impressive both in terms of tension and writing. The Gary Oldman scene is terrifying. The Walken/Hopper confrontation is an acting master class. And Bronson Pinchot, in particular is absolutely hilarious as Elliot the cowardly actor  I particularly enjoyed the scene where he is pulled over for erratic driving  priceless! Despite the unappealing central characters, True Romance is a film that is well worth seeking out.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

One of the all time greats....,"The man, the myth, the legend:  Quentin Tarantino....brings us..... The man, the myth, the legend:  Christopher Walken....in one of the greatest scenes in any movie...ever.  This film has it all..great cast, great writing, great photography the whole nine yards.  I am not a Christian Slater fan, i feel that he can not carry a movie on his own, but because of the superb cast...he doesn't need to.  Even though many of the bigger name stars have roles that are really just cameos (Gary Oldman, Dennis Hopper, Christopher Walken, Tom Sizemore), the film still has a massive entertainment value.  My only wish was that Tarantino himself could have helmed the film (But being that it was his first script, and at the time he hadn't directed a film, I understand.)  Tony Scott can do action, perfect examples are the Last Boyscout (a genre classic), Enemy of the State, and Crimson Tide.This film also has some newcomers that will later become freakin' HUGE! Brad Pitt (in one his finer performances in my opinion).  And Samuel L Jackson (SHAFT himself).  But one person that I just can't see how he got in this movie but turned a good performance was Bronson Pinchot (Balki from ""Perfect Strangers""(TV)). I can imagine the studio meeting on that one...let's get a lovable TV star and make him a foul mouthed naive coke-head!? Inspired casting indeed.If you watch Tarantino's film in order (1) True Romance, (2)Reservoir Dogs, (3) Pulp Fiction, (4)Jackie Brown, (5) Kill Bill vol. 1.  You can see that True Romance isn't stylistically the same due to direction, but you can see the evolution of the poet that is Tarantino.10/10!",,Anonymous,Romance
cinema at its best,"There are movies with incredible cast and crew which turn out to leave a lot to be desired (Departed is a great example), but if you think True Romance might be one of them, you're going to miss a classic!

Definitely one of his best scripts, as there are moments so touching you'll have to cry, so funny you'll laugh your ass off, and guess what? Some violence too. It's hard to find a movie with more great actors in one place than in True Romance. What's more surprising, ALL of them do terrific job! Both Slater and lovely Patricia Arquette are at their top, and Christopher Walken created one of the most classy mobster characters ever.

One of the best movies of the nineties,"You may have seen my reviews scattered over the internet as Luisito Joaquín González. This is not a review so to speak. This is just a few words on this great movie.Tony Scott was not an elite director, but he could and did make the odd top movie. It's possible I could direct True Romance with Tarantino's script, but either way, Scott was at the peak of his powers here.The movie contains love, mafia, drugs, great dialogue and one of the best shootouts ever put to celluloid. Perhaps what makes the movie elite is the Sicilian scene. Whilst the scene cannot be considered as 'racist' as it's praising the moors, it's just a snapshot of a time when movies were not politically correct. That will never happen again. The seventies, the eighties and the nineties were the best cinema ONLY because they weren't living by WOKE guidelines. No one was offended back then, it was just a better time.True Romance was one of the last great movies. Ten years later, things started going downhill and cinema will never recover. The film invokes my memories of wild romantic adventures of my youth. What happens in this movie DOES happen in reality and happened to me twice and I'm only 40. Christian Slater is at the peak of his acting ability in this feature. Whilst never an accomplished actor, he has a strong screen presence and he is able to dominate the screen as would a Jack Nicholson. Brad Pitt, a superb actor, basically plays himself as a stoner, whilst Bronson Pinchot, Tom Sizemore, Chris Penn, James Gandolfini, Chris Walken, Dennis Hopper, Val Kilmer, Patricia Arquette, Michael Rappaport, Saul Rubinek give career best performances in supporting roles. It's surprising Scott wasn't praised higher for his work here. The soundtrack, the direction of the actors- it's all too notch.

True Romance,"True Romance, is about a young man named Clarence Worley, who one night in a movie theater meets a girl named Alabama Whitman, and after that they go get some pie and then go back to his place. Later that evening Alabama admits to Clarence that she is a call girl and was hired by Clarence's boss to sleep with him. Alabama tells Clarence, that she is in love with him and he is in love with her so they get married. Clarence one day decides to go and get Alabama's stuff which is being held at her pimp's place. His name is Drexl Spivey. Once Clarence gets there he kills Drexl, and most of the people in the room and along with getting Alabama's belongings he also takes a suitcase full of cocaine worth a lot of money. Clarence and Alabama then visit Clarence's father Clifford Worley, and tell him that they are going to California for their honeymoon. A man who works for a well known gangster visits Clifford and tries to find out where Clarence and Alabama are because apparently the cocaine belongs to his boss. So while in California, they have a gangster on their trail and while trying to sell the cocaine to a movie producer and things are not as they seem during the deal. True Romance, has good direction, a good script, good performances by everyone involved, good original music, good cinematography and good film editing. The version of the film I saw was the unrated version. True Romance, has some great dialog and is a very fun and entertaining movie. The film is full of action and thrills and it is all done very stylishly. The film is well made and has a good script by Quentin Tarantino, which he sold before he made his first film Reservoir Dogs. The film does have some flaws and some characters I might wanted to have seen and learned more about and some scenes kind of felt like they went on a little too long but the film is generally a lot better than most action films out there and the acting, writing and style of the movie make it also an above average action film. In fact the film is really good and it was a good film for Quentin Tarantino to have been involved in to start his career. A very good action film that is full of energy and will definitely appeal to action fans and fans of Quentin Tarantino.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

Bring it On!,"I speak as a relatively lukewarm fan of Tarantino, but this is one film that he has had a hand in , that I really think deserves a place in the all-time top 200 films.With hilarious characters :Christian Slater, in possibly his most entertaining, and well acted [rare, I know] role. Clarence is the core that holds the movie together and I enjoyed watching his slide from comic book nerd to full scale gun-wielding hero. Although we are witness to the descent into Hell, it never has a Straw Dogs kind of push-the-nerd-to-the-limit feel. It comes across that he is just living out his comic book fantasies for real.Patricia Arquette, full on drop your popcorn screen bomb, the scene in the phonebox has to be one of the sweetest and sexiest couple of minutes a guy could ever dream of. Ah, sweet Alabama.Christopher Walken and Dennis Hopper play what to them must be light entertainment roles. But the heart is in it (unlike many so-called cameos in movies these days) and they bring the whole thing a lovely feeling of an ensemble piece.Not forgetting the rest of the crowd, and some incredibly funny set pieces (witness the cocaine in the car, and the 'who the f**k is Dick?' sequence). This is a movie for a lonely or sad Saturday afternoon. Slap it in the DVD and sit back.The plot follows along at a very snappy pace and the conclusion, complete with the ultimate hommage to shiny guns and cigarettes (Freud, would you please like to comment? :-), leaves us content and satisfied, Heavens it almost has a touch of skewed Disney movie about it.

Christopher Walken and Dennis Hopper scene,"There's nothing new I can add that hasn't already been said about this movie, so I would rather talk about what has to be one of the greatest scenes in movie history:  the confrontation scene between Walken and Hopper.We are so lucky to have this scene to watch over and over again. A lot of people have blasted Tony Roberts' direction, but he DID get these performances for this scene.  The way Walken reacts and smiles at Hopper's ""story"" is subtle and brilliant.  You can see from his reactions that his anger is increasing with each new sentence from Hopper, but he chooses to make it look as if he is amused, not letting Hopper know.  Of course Hopper DOES know, having sized up Walken as well as the situation within seconds. This is his last hurrah -- he knows he is going to die, but he is actually getting the better of Walken in doing so, and you can see it in his eyes during this scene.  Walken creates a sense of menace/impending doom while all the while being friendly and polite -- he is in my opinion the best actor in Hollywood today.  (See The Dead Zone if you don't believe me.)I have to also put in a good word for Gary Oldman's stunningly brilliant performance as well.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Just how far would you go for love?,"Well, if you're a guy like Clarence, then it would seem the answer is 'Pretty far!'. He's a nice enough guy who doesn't have much luck with the ladies, so when Alabama walks into his life it seems like there's going to be strings attached... and there are. Through it all, however, the passion of the young wins through. If that sounds like it's going to be a little too weepy and predictable for the guys though, then you have the wrong film. ""TR"" is smart, sassy and brutal, with an all star cast and notable director delivering the goods at a fast and furious pace.Things settle into a more traditional and familiar vibe in the last quarter, but until then the delightful surprises come completely out of left field. Any scene from the first third, you could take on its own and make another different movie from. To that end, I say commission another script focusing on Gary Oldman's ""Drexl"", now!! It's nothing short of amazing how the British chameleon takes the character on the page and makes him come alive like you've never seen before! The dialogue is good, but his distinctive accent and appearance make this all about creating a memorably loathsome individual from the ground up. Brad Pitt actually performs a similar feat too - as the lovable stoner ""Floyd"" - with only slightly less impact.I love this film so much because it's full of some of the best characters you'll find in crime cinema. Let them take you on a journey with them, and you're liable to find yourself wrung out at the end of it.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
A landmark piece of cinema. It couldn't be any more entertaining.,"Quentin Tarantino and Tony Scott would seem like the oddest of couples when it comes to movie making. Tarantino is the indie God and Scott is Mr. Blockbuster. But in True Romance, as well as with Crimson Tide, we see just how well their styles actually blend. With True Romance, we get a healthy dosage of the raw energy and memorable dialogue one associates with Tarantino, wrapped up in a technically flawless and perfectly paced package. Certainly the best of the two worlds.True Romance is the story of a young loner who spends his time reading comic books and watching Kung-Fu movies. (I wonder where Tarantino came up with that angle!) He's watching a Sonny Chiba tripple feature at a mostly deserted movie house on the night of his birthday, when a beautiful young call-girl walks into the theater and into his life. She has only been a call-girl for a few days, and she's been sent to show this young man a good time. In their brief night together, these two fall deeply in love and get married. There are some problems, however.The young woman has a nasty pimp (It took me about four viewings to realized he's played by Gary Oldman!), and her hubby takes it upon himself to off this guy as an apparent symbol of his love for his new bride. After an extremely violent confrontation at the pimp's lair, our hero finds himself with a suitcase full of cocaine that he mistook for the young woman's belongings. That coke belongs to the mob, and let's just say that they'll do anything to get it back. They follow the young couple all the way from Detroit to L.A. in an attempt to take back what's theirs before the young couple can sell it off. The resulting action is incredible.The film is great on many levels. With the exception of Tombstone, I cannot recall a film where so much of the cast is made up of well-known actors. Many of them like Walken, Kilmer, and Hopper appear only briefly, but they leave a lasting impression on the viewer. And nearly the entire cast dies convincingly. Saul Rubinek does a priceless parody of Joel Silver.Some highlights include an interrogation of Dennis Hopper by Christopher Walken and a bunch of mafia goons. This conversation epitomizes why I love Quentin Tarantino. It is such a brutal scene, but you'll be howling with laughter before it's over.There is quite a bit of violence that some people will find difficult to watch. In one scene, Patricia Arqutte is beaten to a bloody pulp by James Gandolfini. Watch closely after the first punch he hits her with. The camera pauses on his face for a moment, and he gives a truly weird look. You can tell this character loves dishing out pain. Overall, this is not a family picture.The film delivers everything it tries to. The hip brutality of this film has helped set the tone for action films ever since.10 of 10 starsSo sayeth the Hound.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

"Overrated, Inane And Pointless.","I try to use the term ""overrated,"" sparingly. But occasionally their are movies that cannot be described in any other way. True Romance is one of the most inane, and pointless films to ever be called great, that I personally have seen. It was written by Tarantino, and posseses his violent stamp, and typical, over the top ending. The violence I confess I found off putting at times. Particularily the motel room scene, involving Gandolfini and Arquette. Though it's violence is not why I have given it 3/10 . Otherwise I would be giving it a 2/10. Among the lauded performances, Oldhams is good, but not as good as some have made it out to be. Walken is menacing and interesting, but has little to do. Hopper is Hopper and nothing special. Gandolfini does a good job at being scary, while Pitt sleepwalks through his role. But folks, this is a genuinely crappy film, and I would advise potential viewers to go and watch something else instead.",3.0,Anonymous,Romance

The story has a comic book clerk named Clarence  who meets and falls in love with a hooker named Alabama.Clarence confronts her pimp and takes a briefcase full of cocaine on accident. When Clarence discovers this, the two head for  Hollywood and plan to sell it to filmmakers. The drug dealers pursue them. True Romance is an action-packedlove story that delivers and does well. Good cast including Christian Slater, Patricia Arquette, Dennis Hopper, Christopher Walken, Gary Oldman, Brad Pitt, and Val Kilmer. A great cast and an impressive script makes the film shine. 8/10 stars.",,Anonymous,Romance
"""Hey, don't forget the....cleaning products.""","I really wish Brad Pitt would consider reprising his role as the stoner Floyd someday cause he absolutely stole the show-he's hysterical. Some of the classic Tarantino lines of all time and phenomenal scenes that are way outside the edge of reality, but it works. A better ensemble cast than anything else you're liable to find. Was this Gandolfini's first ""sensitive hitman"" role? Patricia Arquette is yummy, Hopper is in rare form, Walken is as menacing as he is weird, Oldman makes a great pimp, we find out about Samuel L's sexual preferences, and Slater manages to turn in a credible understated but high energy performance. A monument to the Nintendo generation I suppose but a great movie worth watching over and over again. Oh yeah, if you're quick to scream ""ripoff"" when you see a road movie that resembles True Romance, NBK, Freeway, Love and a 45, etc then pick up a copy of Badlands with Martin Sheen. Tarantino makes better movies than his predecessors but he's borrowed an idea or two along the way. 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

QT + TS + great actors = brilliant movie,"Great movie! Although it is directed by Tony Scott, Tarantino wrote the script and so you can see his handwriting in the film. And what about the movie? The main actors are C. Slater and P. Arquette on which I do not have a high opinion, but therefore other secondary actors are Rockin! I must admit that I only recently heard of this movie, and there are so many faces who are acting it's just unbelievable. Chances are 80% sure that one of your top 5 actors starring in this film, without any exaggeration, just look at the list of actors for this movie. Almost every scene in the film is superbly made​​, the acting and dialog are priceless to me. Today, there should be at some 30-40 films that contained in itself such good scenes that have this movie that lasts 2 hours. The music is also excellent and commendable. Disadvantages of the film to me is leading actors that I never detested. I give it a solid and strong 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

Tarantino at his best.,"Easily Quentin's best flick, nothing about this movie is original, and nothing SHOULD work, but it does.

The supporting cast are the force that drives this movie,"True Romance has it all. Likable central characters, over the top 'ultra' violence, dark humour, memorable quotes, poetic monologues, surrealism and above all else, incredible performances from a cast with an immense array of talent.The script, which was originally a 500 page screenplay that was reportedly a hybrid of Natural Born Killers and True Romance, is Tarantino at his very best. The execution is even better. The film is a 2 hour whirlwind that never settles, keeps throwing plot twists at you and most importantly, never takes itself too seriously.The supporting cast are the force that drives this movie and the protagonists (Slater and Arquette) are completely lovable. Their 'love at first sight' storyline is completely absurd but in a strange way believable. You really buy into their relationship and want to see their romance blossom.As for set pieces, the confrontation between Hopper and Walken is just phenomenal. I won't give too much away but it's clear that Tarantino has always had a strange, sometimes disturbing obsession with the word 'nigger'. The delivery of both Hopper and Walken's dialogues is a an absolute masterclass.We also see Gary Oldman showing exactly why he is one of the best actors of the past 2 decades. Casting him as a dread-locked rasta is both surprising and stunning in equal measure. He is, as always, completely believable. Comparing his performance in this with say, The Dark Knight Rises (which is a very understated and underrated performance) shows this actors amazing range of diversity. I have to admit, I thought his part was slightly underwritten.Add to that Val Kilmer playing 'The King', Chris Penn playing a cop, a pre-sopranos Gandolfini as a hit-man, Brad Pitt as a mindless stoner and you have one of the greatest casts assembled in recent years. With some brilliantly ad-libbed scenes, industry 'in-jokes' and a thrilling climax, this is a must see piece of perfection.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Overrated, like Tarantino.","Don't kill me yet, let me speak, although Tarantino is good he is definitely nowhere near greatness, yet. Kill Bill was his best film (which i would give a 9 out of a 10), reservoir dogs was good, but far from great, a 6 out of a 10, Jackie brown was bad, and finally pulp fiction, one of the most overrated films ever alongside 2001 and Seven Samurai (both of which sucked terribly). Pulp fiction wasn't bad it just wasn't very good, just because the story was chopped up doesn't make it a good one, it was uninteresting and had ZERO action, also the rape scene and the dialogue were pointless, all they said was the f word and the rape scene was just wrong, if it had more action and a better story with better dialogue it would be much better, i would give Pulp a 4 out of a 10, so as you can see Tarantino is good but needs to do a lot more to become great. Now onto this movie, just let me say that this is Scott's film so give him some credit, Tarantino wrote it, Scott made it, all the performances and style are from Scott, he is a good director capable of just as much if not more then Tarantino. Overall this was an average film, basically a chick flick with violence, drugs, and great dialogue, a highlight of the film, the dialogue was creative an hilarious, and Brad Pitt cracked me up, he played the pothead so well, in fact he was a little too good, wonder what he was doing back then. It had style, it had humor, it had decent performances, but it lacked a complex story, action, and drama. I give it a 5 out of a 10, Scott has gotten better since this and i cant wait to see Domino, as for Tarantino i hope he continues making movies just as long as he makes them more like Kill Bill, he is good but don't think of him as a god because he is far from anywhere near that status, i hope he does Inglorious Bastards he would make a great war movie, also i would like to see his new kung fu movie, sounds good.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance

It has a fascinating cast, most of which are among Hollywood's elite, however it's also a great time capsule which shows how different their careers were from then to now. Slater's career was still new but it started to take off shortly after this film. Brad Pitt was pretty much a nobody back then and many of my friends are fascinated to the role he plays in this movie. Samuel L. Jackson's stock continued to rise while Patricia Arquette's remained below the radar. Gary Oldman gives a phenomenal performance and should have been nominated for an award, he is a brilliant actor. I can't say enough about this film as Tarantino and Scott's deliver a great piece of art that will remain a classic for many years to come.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Very cool movie,True Romance is the epitome of cool when it comes to movies.

No Masterclass Here,"Like much of Quentin Tarantino's catalogue, the final result is just a tad heartless. There's passion, there's ingenuity (in the dialogues) but nothing tangible in terms of raw emotion. I don't buy in to this titular romance, because it's all rather haphazard. The film gives you maybe one scene to really try and grasp how utterly two people can fall for each other, but I don't think it's enough. Christian Slater is one of my favourite actors and Patricia Arquette is awesome, but unfortunately, they do not sell it. It's a movie loaded with moments and great quotes, however. Dennis Hopper and Christopher Walken's 11 minute interaction remains one of the best in all of cinema, and Gary Oldman is seriously impressive as the psychotic Drexel - But pair that with the middle of the film, where we really slow down to a bit of a slog. Nothing is compelling there, even with the desperate presence of a roller-coaster. Moments, yes... Martin Scorsese, for the sake of argument, is a ""moment maestro"", but he almost always delivers on the touchy-feely stuff as well. For all it's energy, I don't think True Romance is quite the ""trip"" many will have you believe. There's gold but no platinum.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Only a couple Elvis appearances away from True Greatness...,"Guys like Quentin Tarantino and Kevin Smith burst out of the blocks, garnering massive critical acclaim for their originality and fresh approach to both dialogue and film-making in general. The unfortunate reality for both is that as their careers progressed they both fell in love with their own press and reputations, resulting in a loss of perspective and an inability to differentiate between truly entertaining moments; and self indulgent crap.That's why I strongly believe that for both of the above mentioned allowing other directors to take a crack at their scripts. Hopefully the fresh eye might be more likely to excise irrelevant and plain silly material, while keeping the core elements intact.I strongly doubt anyone else might've improved on the final versions of Pulp Fiction or Reservoir Dogs, but since then it's fair to say that Tarantino hasn't made anything rivaling either in terms of quality or longevity. (I'm not sure what anyone else would've made of Dogma, Clerks and Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back to be honest!) We'll never know what Tarantino might have done if allowed to proceed with his True Romance script, what I can say is that the guy who ended up with it did an extremely good job. Not quite great mind you, but about as good as I think this was destined to be.The tale of young lovers Clarence and Alabama Worley starts with them finding each other in Detroit, shows how they come into a large cache of drugs when Clarence decides to 'emancipate' his (now ex-)hooker wife from her menacing and dangerous pimp, and follows them as they flee cross country to LA to work out how best to turn the illicit stash into travellin' cash with which to finance their new lives.But True Romance is more than a rote tale of young lurrrve, it is essentially a series of memorable moments placed amid a sea of references to the obscure and unusual, references that Tarantino has since turned into a career obsession. The resulting Tony Scott helmed film contains Elvis, Kung Fu movies, wannabe-black white boys, comic books, B-movie references and of course long tracts of intricately crafted dialogue.As we saw in Pulp and Dogs, these speeches delivered from the lips of quality actors in between well directed passages of action often result in simply legendary output. Samuel L Jackson, Christopher Walken, Harvey Kietel and Steve Buscemi have the capacity to elevate. In lesser hands er lips not so good, (David Carradine, practically everyone in Death Proof – even Kurt Russell couldn't 'cool up' his banal speeches).True Romance manages a few classic moments and has introduced some legendary bit characters. In the moments category the stand off between evil mob boss Christopher Walken and humble everyman – and Clarence's Dad – Dennis Hopper is one for the ages.Gary Oldman squeezes every ounce out of his drug dealing pimp Drexl, and Bronson Pinchot gets many laughs in one of his less cartoony film roles as out of his depth PA to a big time Hollywood producer Elliot Blitzer. (Brad Pitt and Samuel L Jackson have less meaty roles but do what they can to remain in the memory banks.) The only misstep in my view is the inclusion of Val Kilmer as Elvis Presley, who appears only to Clarence as sort of his guiding angel – apparently this is a sign of Clarence's mental state but this is never really explained and comes off as a little too much – even in a film such as this.Aside from the King, True Romance works because it gets the mix right between violence, laughs and even music.Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette are both perfectly capable in the central roles as Clarence and Alabama while the rest of the cast try to steal scenes from them.Clarence is cocksure and confident, and Alabama is equally arresting and sassy – with Arquette's bouncing jubblies deserving acting credits of their own.It might have turned out better in Tarantino's hands, but I'm more than happy with what the underrated Tony Scott managed to conjure up. Given his track record of turning potential mediocrity into entertaining flicks such as The Last Boy Scout, Deja Vu and last year's Unstoppable I think he deserves as much credit for the end result as Tarantino does for coming up with the script in the first place.Final Rating – 8 / 10. One or two moments from greatness. True Romance is certainly violent, profane and at times plain ridiculous. It is also fun, creative and extremely memorable.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
NOTE TO SELF: ALWAYS read the 1 star reviews before wasting time watching a lousy movie !,"I think I hate anything to do with Tarantino. I saw Reservoir Dogs once and liked it so I've kept trying but he just seems like a childish man who grew up watching really bad 1970's movies but actually LIKED them. I'm the same age as him and those films were REALLY BAD and not even funny in a B-movie kind of way. Take the movie Shaft as an example. It was a terrible, stupid movie full of bad acting and the only good thing was the Isaac Hayes song 'Shaft', and that's IT -- NOTHING else about the film is any good at all and ANYTHING from the 70's that's labelled as 'Blaxploitation' is just pure rubbish. Except for maybe the Apollo moon missions, 1970's in general was a really bad time to be alive. Yes there was 'some' good music here and there but cocaine and disco music was also really big so it was a WEIRD time.Anyhow this True Romance movie is pure rubbish. Truly, don't waste your time.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
Fresh Love Story from Q's 15 Minutes of Fame,"Tarrentino's films all give the impression of being segments or episodes in an all encompassing interelated saga. That's probably more of a shot than a compliment however. The Q to me has always meant Quirk, not much else. True Romance has a couple of truly fabulous scenes, but overall, the movie only rates as good. Too much is variations on themes he explores in previous or subsequent stuff, and the repetiveness to me is boring. Slater in lieu of his usual Jack Nicholson impression, instead here, gives us Harvey Keitel (I think). The accent he employs wanders in and out of his performance, and invokes cringes at points. The rest of the cast is terrific, and the film warrants a viewing just to see all of these huge performers working together in one project. Brad Pitt, Christopher Walken, Tony Soprano, Gary Oldman, Samel Jackson, Dennis Hopper...very cool.",,Anonymous,Romance
True Romance,"Truly a wonderful movie and probably Christian Slater's best performance. Some may argue with me on this one (that would be your Pulp Fiction die hard fans), but I also believe that it is Quentin Tarantino's best script ever. A deranged love story surrounded by impossible odds. Using street smarts, sometimes, our hero ""Clarence Worley"" played by Christian Slater, mostly trips and falls out of the way of bad situations. You can see the train wreck coming as the calamity of errors start brewing from the very beginning to it's climatic end. The cameo roles play by Dennis Hopper and Christopher Walken are too good to be missed. I have watched this movie a few times looking for the holes and haven't been able to find even one.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
The Amazing Story of a Bullet-Proof Love ...,"There's one thing that ""True Romance"" doesn't lie about: its title. The romance is the core of the story and the soul of the movie from beginning to end. As soon as Clarence Whitman (Christian Slater), a comic-book vendor, fan of Elvis Presley and old Kung-Fu films -translation: a geek- meets Alabama Parker (Patricia Arquette), a hooker, we know and we feel that for each step one would make, the other would follow.What is extraordinary in Tony Scott's film is how it detaches itself from both action films where romances are usually reduced to cheesy subplots, and from romances since the two protagonists fall in love in a very surprising immediacy. No time for build-ups, for growing complicity, for love-and-hate wisecracks, ""True Romance"" echoes the classic loves-at-first-sight movies such as ""West Side Story"", ""Romeo and Juliet"" or any Disney film. It's a deliberate naivety enabling us to keep our hearts hooked to two endearing characters, trapped in a world of drugs and shotguns, where a bullet can hit you faster than love. The romance defines the couple's new life but also their new quest: living together in peace.And there's this dreamlike feeling conveyed by Hans Zimmer's score. The ""You're So Cool"" theme is so close to Gassenhauer's music it clearly indicates that the film is a homage to Terrence Malick's ""Badlands"". But while ""Badlands"" was about crime in a romantic setting, ""True Romance"" is a romance in a criminal setting. One is a nihilistic escape; the other is much more idealistic. Clarence and Alabama try to find a new path for their lives and escape from cops and gangsters, both equally antagonistic. Their escape is materialized by the 'Caribbean' tone of Zimmer's music, playful, sweet with a child-like lullaby purity, embodying a beautiful dream. And the closer they get to their dreams, the louder the music is, culminating with a powerful ending.And the dream's beauty is worth the deadly price. The dream-like nature of the romance illustrated by the music creates the perfect contrast with its sordid setting, allowing the story to create a dichotomy between love and violence with passion as their common link. The treatment of violence parallels love's connection to the future: it's less the violent moments that scare but the way they are patiently built up. Four times, the movie involves a confrontation where one has no chance AND nothing to lose, except a beloved one. And these scenes are cleverly slow paced and punctuated with thrilling exchanges, just to let us time to revise our prognostics. On that level, ""True Romance"" stands alone as one of the greatest action thrillers for four specific scenes magnificently written.The first scene seals the union between Clarence and Alabama when he decides to 'buy' her from Drexl. The pimp, played by Gary Oldman in a terrifying mix between Taxi Driver's Spot and Norman Stansfield, is defeated by the geeky Clarence who wins Alabama's freedom plus a briefcase of cocaine that would start the whole trouble with the Mafia and the Police. The second scene is probably the most praised and mainly remembered for its confrontation between two acting Gods: Christopher Walken and Dennis Hopper, the deliverer of the infamous ""Sicily"" monologue. These two scenes alone deserve to be mentioned among the best pieces of screen-writing from the last 20 years; from Clarence's bluffing confidence in the way he retells all the trivia about an obscure blaxploitation film airing on TV, to the story of Sicilians having African heritage that would have made Vito Corleone roll over his grave.The third scene involves a disturbing fight between the future Tony Soprano, James Gandolfini, and poor Patricia Arquette, the fight is so unequal that it's physically painful to see that poor creature beaten to death by that big thug. Yet, it powerfully serves the idea that one having nothing to lose can develops a superhuman strength. The last scene is the pay-off of the entire intricate plot, a Mexican stand-off where all the protagonists meet: the cops, the snitch, the dealers, the Mafia, Clarence and Alabama, for a final mayhem of bullets. ""True Romance"" is also a true thriller and a film served by great supporting performances through roles with extremely short life expectancies. Still, all these scenes have less in common their violence than the way they romanticize violence as the only answer when one has nothing to lose, where there's no passion without pain, no triumph without hardship. Whether it's Clarence challenging Drexl, his father provoking Cocotti or Alabama against Virgil, it's all about love.These scenes have another thing in common, they break taboos, cops die as casually as bandits, a man beats a woman, the ultimate insult to the Sicilians is made, and a ruthless pimp is defeated by a poor geek, fan of Elvis  The script defies all our conceptions of gangster and crime movies, playing both on the field of homage and iconoclasm. It's like the dream of a movie fan who's finally got the big role in the film, and this embodies the whole dream-like aspect of ""True Romance"", something transcended by the ending and sublimated by the last lines, some of the best I've ever heard in a film. The movie is pure geek-escapism but written with so much confidence that it refreshes all the dusty heritage of a genre as old as cinema, with a harrowing fantasy dimension.I mentioned before that Tony Scott's ""The Last Boy Scout"" had an entertaining value because we didn't have to care much for the plot, here not only we care for the story but also for the characters, and this is why the film is one of the few that belongs to the writer more than the director, a movie written by a man who loved films so much he decided to tell them his way... a young movie genius named Quentin Tarantino.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Truly Quentin, Truly Classic","Send in the clones, a new era is born. In one of Quentin's first scripts we find trace elements foreshadowing the next decade of film. Threads of romantism weave the fabric of this crime epic filled with some of the most quotable dialouges and monolouges since they added sound to film.Plot: Cupid shoots an arrow in Detroit and sends a pair of young lovers to L.A. to make an early withdrawal from their newly found retirement fund. Then Quentin happens.Risa Bramon Garcia & Billy Hopkins should be given Academy Awards. To assemble a cast which fits the script like a hand in glove. Slater plays our 'Hero' a comic book store employee who wills confidence backed by Elvis, his conjured 'Jimeny Cricket'. Patricia is our heroine with subtle glances, giggles and moxy that can beat a man to a pulp in ten minutes. Besides Christian and Patricia the rest of the cast is given very select supporting roles, with sometimes as little airtime as one scene. Regardless, every performance is truly memorable, whether it be Oldman as a Pimp City Wigga, or Walken as a ruthless Sicilian. Sizemore and Penn work magic together as Narcotics officers looking for the collar. Pinchot as the manic drama intern caught in the middle of the fiasco. Gandolfini as a ruthless thug who doesn't hold back when it comes to beating a woman. You really can not find a bad performance in this film.Truly this is the case when the script moves the cast and vise versa. Tony Scott should not be ignored either, of 'Top Gun' status and forefather of post modern 'Hollywood' action flicks. He wagered against Hollywood odds by keeping as close to the script as possible. The steel drums on the sound track are placed so accurately it reminds the audience the title involves 'Romance'. The only problem I could have with this movie is the fact that it's filmed in chronological order unlike the script which segments the beginning in to the middle.Bottom Line: A Must See!

"Amazing, while Comparable to Pulp Fiction","Pulp Fiction is seen as Tarantino's best movie, but True Romance is overlooked. While it wasn't directed by Tarantino and doesn't go into situations as bizarre as Pulp Fiction, True Romance was one of his first screenplays. Fortunately it was picked up by Tony Scott after being sold. You know how people say things are ""high-octane"" when the stuff has energy, but they don't want to think of a real way to explain it? Octane is the oxygen in gasoline that makes it burn slower in cars to get more mileage. This movie had the right amount of octane to be fast-paced, but not blow past its human moments. There was plenty of nitrous-oxide on the way to help it be batshit crazy.The first twenty minutes of this movie were insane. We see a ridiculous love story that's believable and very well acted by Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette. We see a shootout with a wigger pimp played by Gary Oldman. And most importantly, we see a huge briefcase of cocaine fall into the couple's possession, forcing them to sell it in Hollywood. The story wastes no time moving right along to the conclusion that is a solid example of convergence.The one thing that threw me off was the score. It wasn't fitting in a lot of scenes. Hanz Zimmer is the man as far as movie scoring goes, but it was awkward in this film. It wasn't crime drama music. It was we're-going-to-the-beach-with-our-xylophones-and-bongos-man kind of music. This got in the way of some deeper character moments that would have been better left without music at all, let alone this music. Halfway through the movie this trend of unfitting music tapers off and doesn't disturb the torture scene, the climax, or a few other key pieces.I loved the hell out of every scene in this movie. It was a prime example of both crime and drama. Character is so often shoved to the side in an act of domestic violence by its abusive owner: action. In True Romance, the two concepts were married and stayed together until their chaotic, but fitting and synchronous passing in the last scene. Should I meet the cast and crew, I'll blow them all over-exaggerated air kisses. Mwah to you. Mwah to you. Mwah to this movie.

A ridiculous masterpiece.,"This over-the-top, violent, hilarious movie has to be at the top of anybody's list who loves the outrageous style of Tarantino (this is defiantly some of his best work).  One of the best casts EVER assembled, it's a perfect mix of seasoned actors with relative newcomers (it's great to see a young James Gandolfini and Michael Rapaport).  I think it's also safe to say that you will see some of Christian Slater's best work, along with one of Gary Oldman's greatest characters, Drexler the pimp.The story does start slow, but that is all part of the films appeal as it develops the romance between Slater  and Arquette, then slams us into a full blown Tarantino world full of surprises and mayhem.  Look for some great cameos  some cool comic references  Elvis sightings  the John Woo homage  and lots of other insanity with excellent directing by Tony Scott .

Awesome,"Let's face it... romance is weird. It can be sappy, it can be schmaltzy, it can be awkward, and it can be violent. For the film True Romance, we focus on the violent. The film is only written, not directed by, Quentin Tarantino, and you will not forget it. It is directed by Tony Scott, and props to him for handling a Tarantino script so substantially. True Romance is about Clarence Worley, played by Christian Slater. On a lonely night, Clarence meets Alabama Whitman (Patricia Arquette) and makes love to her that night, only to find out later that she is a call girl. It doesn't matter to Clarence, however, as he eventually goes on to marry Alabama. The films begins as a sappy romance story, but it eventually leads to being a parody of the typical boy meets girl story. The trouble begins when Clarence goes and kills Alabama's former pimp (played by the always incredible Gary Oldman) and steals 500 grand worth of cocaine from him. The two star-crossed lovers find themselves in a mess when they skip town to try to sell the cocaine in Hollywood, all the while being chased by the mobsters who want their stash back. What could have been a silly and over the top disaster of a film, becomes something absolutely awesome.True Romance is simply just fun and intense. The story is absurd and crazy, and it fits with all its hectic dialouge and nutty characters. Everything in this film works. Clarence and Alabama are the only two characters in the film that we begin and end with. The rest of the cast is a makeup of cameos, each serving their own great purpose. Gary Oldman's scene as the pimp Drexl is absolutely incredible, and Oldman proves once again that he is one of the greatest character actors of this age. Dennis Hopper appears for a couple of scenes as Clarence's father, and he masters his scenes with all his subtle excellence. In his final scene he appears with Christopher Walken, and it makes for one of the most intense and riveting scenes of the whole film. It is one that will keep you on the edge of your seat with suspense billowing over you. Other talents like Brad Pitt, James Gandolfini, and even Samuel L. Jackson for a very brief scene, give each of their scenes the full appreciation and dedication they deserve.I can't imagine what this film would have been like if it didn't have the kind of talent behind its dialouge like Quentin Tarantino. This kind of darkly comic, visceral, pulpy thriller is just what Tarantino excels at, and he turns a schmaltzy romance into a violent and drugged up thriller, that happens to be driven by a strange and very unconventional romance. Ironically, Tarantino was hardly a recognized name at this point in his career. His only credit at this point was his independent success of Reservoir Dogs (1992), that really wouldn't get the recognition it deserved until the massive success of Pulp Fiction (1994), the year after True Romance. And even though Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction are, in my opinion, much better films, True Romance is not a film to be forgotten. It can definitely be considered a hidden gem.True Romance delivers everything you want. It has a great story, snappy and quick witted dialouge, a great cast of characters, and some of the most wicked and bloodiest fight scenes you'll see, especially in films with the word romance in them. The title of the film is extremely fitting, because this film no doubt displays the true meaning of romance, which is sticking by your partner through thick and thin, and not leaving their side no matter what kind of trouble they get themselves into. And Alabama is just that kind of person for Clarence. These two characters are not good people, they are ruthless and violent in every way, but they are no doubt in love. And this gives True Romance an ironic greatness that you just don't see work in all films. If you want an exciting and tons of fun experience, watch True Romance.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
for childish adults only,"Probably the most stupid movie I have ever seen, and I write as someone who liked Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs. The only person that comes out of it well is the casting director who managed somehow (presumably Tarantino's name) to get great actors to waste themselves on it.The script (I assume Tarantino, who can do better, phoned his ideas in and someone else finished it off - literally) is a completely inept attempt at ironic pulp noir dialog but misses it by a mile. Hopper, Walken and Oldman are stuck with overwrought nonsense to chew their way through.The spoof overdone violence was done better by Monty Python's version of Peckinpah. The portrayal of Mafia was tired, leaning on funny accents and slapstick, and looked sad and dated in comparison to any Scorsese movie, The Godfather or The Sopranos.The two leads try hard to portray an unjustifiable transition from someone who is far to nice to make it as a call girl (a strained and unnecessary salacious piece of plotting anyway), who is suddenly able to overcome James Gandolfini with a corkscrew, and a mild mannered guy who works in a shop, who becomes an ultra-violent maniacal killer who goes on a killing spree out of petty jealousy spurred on by the ghost of Elvis for no discernible reason except a vaguely 50s road trip nostalgia which fails to sustain enough to give the film some ambience.You can guess the entire movie by simply reading a plot synopsis and watching the trailer, no need at all to use up 90 minutes on it.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
"An amazing cast list, and a fine turn by Saul Rubinek.","I've nothing to add to an already comprehensively reviewed film, except a word about Saul Rubinek's performance. He play Lee Donowitz, a corrupt Hollywood movie producer with criminal tendencies.It's tempting to speculate that the part was based on an actual person (quite possible in La La Land). Whatever the origin, Rubinek portrays the character with enormous skill - sleazy, charming, camp, vulnerable and menacing all at once. His final anguished outburst after discovering he has been betrayed is surprisingly moving and alarmingly convincing. Terrific acting. Bravo. Indeed, the movie is full of superb performances from a once-in-a-lifetime cast.",,Anonymous,Romance
Great pre-Pulp Fiction Tarantino,"Wow. What a movie. Another great Tarantino crime story released in between Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction, and absolutely distinctive from both of them. That probably has to do with the fact it's done by a different director, and one who does an admirable job, like this is a great looking, well shot and edited film with a high pulse to it, but scriptwise, this is all Tarantino, from the pop culture references to the dialogue exchanges about whatever that feel genuine to the plot that's a series of coincidences building up to a moment of pure chaos, this is still very much him.As much as I love his other movies, though, this definitely has a vibe different from his other work (again, most likely from a different director) that I think works a little better than some of his own directorial work. There's a sweetness to this that feels sincere, and that doesn't feel clouded by the pop culture, pure cinema irony of his other work, like the performances here are very sincere, the violence is brutal and not really glamourized, and the film itself just feels more genuine, like that score the whole way through is deeply emotional, and it's playing without a hint of irony, and I kinda like that. Despite how cruel some of these events are, there's a warmth here that works and makes it feel fun.And man, honestly, another movie where every single actor is firing on all cylinders, most of them giving performances I'd rank among their best despite how little screentime some of them get, like every single actor in here gives a very indelible performance, and everyone's on the same wavelength; of course Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette are great, they have a very real chemistry here, but man...Dennis Hopper, Christopher Walken, Michael Rapaport, Chris Penn, James Gandolfini, Gary Oldman, ho lord, so many actors on fire killin' it here, a real actors' movie.I love Pulp Fiction and a lot of Tarantino's later work, but man, honestly really cool to see a film that's a different approach to one of his scripts from his own, like it's so different in certain ways but also absolutely his own. Highly recommended if you like his work but haven't gotten to this yet. It's not like some of his own work where it's made up almost entirely of indelible moments, but maaaan, there's a lot of good stuff here.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Proof that a great script is all a great movie needs.,"When I first saw True Romance, I was disappointed that Quentin Tarantino did not direct his own script. I imagined that True Romance would have been even better if he did. But after becoming very familiar with Tarantino's work, I love that Tony Scott was the director.In ways True Romance turned out to be even better. Tarantino has a very distinct style of directing which really can take over the script itself, with a few exceptions like Jackie Brown. Mr. Scott on the other hand, did a fantastic directing job, for letting the script just fly off the screen, letting the camera to just be there and not distracting from the amazing performances which only added to the screenplay.So, not only is Tony Scott a fantastic director, by creating True Romance into a motion picture, we also get to see Tarantino's work form another visual perspective and for this I'm very grateful. For this is truly a unique film even though at first viewing it may not appear to be so.Enjoy.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

"A film where love is unbelievable, the characters are unlikely, and the action scenes are brutal and quite intense.","This is one of those films that you shouldn't watch with your family: it's full of violent scenes, foul dialogue full of profanity, several sex scenes, among other heavy features. The story isn't exactly nice either: during his birthday, a seemingly ordinary man meets a seductive woman and the two get very involved. We learn that she is a prostitute, and was hired to be with him that night. They decide to escape, but are forced to kill her pimp and take with them a suitcase full of pure cocaine.For me, the film's biggest problem wasn't the violence (Tarantino uses it regularly and is considered brilliant), but rather the implausibility of the story: I wouldn't believe in love at first sight with a prostitute, I find the idea implausible, and the same can be said about the idea of a frail boy, with a perfectly ordinary life, becoming in a few hours a brutal murderer and potential drug dealer. These are things that don't fit, but that the film takes advantage of to create a kind of ""Romeo and Juliet Bang Bang"".There are several well-known names in the cast. For me, the best performance came from Gary Oldman, who is extraordinarily good in the role of a violent pimp. I wish that his participation was not so brief. Patricia Arquette is sexy when she's almost naked, and that was put to full use. As an actress, she did what she could, but she was given such bad material and such an unbelievable character that she couldn't do much. In turn, Christian Slater is not a good actor. At least, I think that he lost itself a lot after ""Name of the Rose"". Here, he keeps the same persona he presented in ""Heathers"", but without such an intelligent script to base it on. The actor did the job that was possible with bad material and a very bad character. Chris Walken is good in the role of the big villain: he knows how to be cold and appear threatening. Val Kilmer and Brad Pitt make brief appearances, but I doubt they want to remember this work, where they were very far from the shape we are used to.Technically, the film stands out for the avalanche of good special effects it used in the action and shooting scenes, which are deeply crafted and stylized. Fans of action films will definitely enjoy this, and the climactic scene is worthy of an anthology. The rest ends up not really interesting and not having much relevance.",2.0,Anonymous,Romance

The best parts of the Film are as good as any at the time and realized a new Screen Writer's entry into Hollywood.There are a few things that keep this from being the Director's and the Writer's best. It is just so heavy-handed at times that it almost loses its edge. The two cops for example are so over the top that they become almost unbearable (""I love this Clarence guy"") is not only used once but again and again. The Movie Producer and his aid almost bring the whole thing to a point of asinine absurdity that is intolerable.

A Love Letter to Tarantino's Wildest Dreams,"Tony Scott's ""True Romance"" is a masterclass in stylized storytelling, a vibrant tapestry woven from the threads of passion, violence, and the quest for freedom. Penned by Quentin Tarantino, this cult classic film encapsulates the director's trademark flair for sharp dialogue and eclectic characterizations while showcasing Scott's visual prowess in crafting an electrifying cinematic experience.At the heart of the film lies the whirlwind romance between Clarence Worley (Christian Slater) and Alabama Whitman (Patricia Arquette), two star-crossed lovers who embark on a reckless journey fueled by love and a suitcase full of stolen drugs. Their escapades unfold with a kinetic energy that perfectly complements the film's eclectic soundtrack, weaving seamlessly between moments of tender intimacy and explosive violence. The ensemble cast is a veritable who's who of talent, featuring standout performances from Dennis Hopper, Gary Oldman, and Christopher Walken. The infamous Sicilian scene remains one of the most quotable moments in cinema, showcasing the film's unique ability to blend tension with unexpected humor.What truly sets True Romance apart is its essential exploration of love and loyalty amidst chaotic circumstances. Clarence and Alabama's relationship is a testament to the idea that true love is often found in the unlikeliest of scenarios. It's a film that dares to ask: How far would you go for the one you love?",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

The settings of the scenery do look well.It is certainly overly violent and overly stylized either way intriguing dialogue throughout. Not on the level of fascination of Pulp Fiction in terms of dialogue and intrigued but there are some decent moments.

Crazy fun (even without Tarantino's direction),"Quentin Tarantino is not in the director's chair, but True Romance feels almost entirely like his product. It has all the trademarks of the auteur he would amount to in the years that followed; the film is delightfully hammy, sprinkled with amusing banner which shows (among other things) a love for the cinema. It has a dose of Asian cinema to it, and the violence, while gratuitous, is effectively satirical. It features a cast of highly familiar faces, some who can act some who can't, but everybody pulls their weight here, and nobody upstages anybody else.In scene one, Chrisitian Slater sits at a bar and tells the girl next to him how he wishes he could be Elvis. It is ironic considering he got his wish seven years later, backing up Kevin Costner in 3000 Miles to Graceland. Tarantino loves bar scenes. Were he in the director's chair, this intro would be longer.So who IS in the director's chair then? True Romance is a film by Tony Scott, (who probably needs no introduction). Tarantino would surely not give his script to anyone unless he felt they would match his vision or intended approach. Scott clearly achieves this. The movie is played mostly for fun, yet it doesn't get carried away. Scott's direction is progressive. Tarantino films are much more slower. Even though True Romance gets increasingly more convoluted, so to does it get funnier, and it comes with a pretty good pay off.True Romance is definitely a forerunner to Pulp Fiction. Back in 1992, this would've been a good hint to the critics of what was to come from Quentin Tarantino. Pulp Fiction was definitely his most inventive feature, but True Romance may be more fun.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

A message from another time,"I remember when this movie was cool - romantic, wild, charming, witty. And as sad as it sounds, I have to admit it hasn't aged well - for me, of course, as it's all highly subjective.One thing that I though would stand the trials of time was characters - as all of them are unique, grotesque, over the top, and played just right. However, the reality is, *were* played just right, all those years ago. Now, many performances look odd and cringy and just way too theatrical.Another thing I was hoping to remain sharp were dialogues - daring, romantic, punchy. Those, however, feel more like made-up, cringy and chaotic (not to mention main character being plain hysterical and disrespectful to his fiancee/wife).And then the general pacing and audacity of the movie feels off - it's too slow or too fast or too disjointed. It was great when it was pioneering the landscape of bold action flicks, but now it looks and feels very aged.It's still a part of action movie history though, so if one feels like a history lesson or very nostalgic, it could still work.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance
True Romance as an updated Badlands?,"I find that True Romance intersects with Terence Malick's Badlands in a few interesting ways - perhaps QT is responding to Malick's classic by copying some stylistic devices.  Both films are capable of being lumped together under the ""road movie"" subgenre of the crime film, so it's not too inconceivable that Tarantino and Scott had Bad Lands on their minds while making Romance.  Both films open and close with a voice-over by the female lead and in both voice-overs, the character establishes herself initially as a rather inexperienced person, one who didn't expect to be involved in the action to follow.  In Badlands, Kit murders Holly's father and thus begins their crime spree; in Romance, Clarence kills Drexel, the closest thing to a father-figure that Alabama has and likewise makes it necessary for the couple to run from the law.  Also, the two films' incidental music is too similar to be a coincidence.",,Anonymous,Romance
The greatest film ever made?...quite possibly!,"Well, i've been watching films like this and others since I was five, and i love them.

"Beautifully Executed Thriller, Of Which Some Parts Have Not Aged Well","Despite having seen this before - admittedly not since its original release - and its place in the pop culture of the 1990s, I remember very little about this. But what we have in this Tarantino-written, Tony Scott directed thriller about a pair of lovers running from a drug gang, is a tight thriller (it lacks the undisciplined sprawl of many of Tarantino's later films) with a brilliant script that lapses too often into things that just haven't aged well into these more aware days. The performances are universally excellent, and Scott's sheen looks good (as always); Tarantino's obsession with men shouting in a Mexican standoff is probably not necessary in the film's climax, and it inevitably lacks extra depth.

Clarence and Alabama,"Despite the heavy action ""True Romance"" offers rough and powerful love story of two outcast of society.Tony Scott directed and (my favorite) Quentin Tarantino wrote this enjoyable package of action and humor. I don't watch so much action but this, i have to admit, is pretty darn good! If I could write like Tarantino I would not be working as a video store clerk. (Trivia: Tarantino was a video store clerk himself before hitting big with scripts like ""Natural Born Killers"" and ""True Romance""!) Maybe someday I'll be credited on the covers of films instead of renting them...The story starts from the point when Clarence (Christian Slater) marries a hooker Alabama Whitman (beautiful Patricia Arquette). The couple get swirled into the cruel world of drugs as the two of them ran off with Alabama's pimp cocaine case. Soon they have the mafia after them...The movie includes some of the best supporting role characters who are created by the genius mind of Tarantino. Brad Pitt makes a memorable appearance as a happy stoner Floyd. As memorable character is the pimp played by super-talented Gary Oldman. And of course Samuel L. Jackson makes a short appearance in the film. Nevertheless my favorite character is stone cold mafia boss Vincenzo Coccotti (raw Christopher Walken).Smoky-voiced Chris Isaak's theme song ""Two Hearts"" ends the love story in great way!I'm afraid that they don't know how to make this kind of movies anymore...

The acting and script tower over mindless direction,"I'm sure that the final shootout in this movie was originally written by Tarantino to be a farcicist romp, but Tony Scott makes no light of that. Instead of showing violence as absurdity, he shows it as a glamorous way of dealing with one's aggression. In fact, Scott's direction almost made me not like this film. The camera never stops and the fanatical editing is overkill. This just goes to show you that no one can direct a Tarantino script other than Tarantino himself. Old QT would have made this movie violent and funny, instead of violent and silly. The acting cannot be faulted, though. Gary Oldman, Brad Pitt and Christopher Walken are the best of the bunch. I've never cared much for Michael Rapaport, and would've much rather seen someone like Steve Buscemi play this part. And about Tom Sizemore and Chris Penn: Was I supposed to feel for these guys in the movie? I know that they're cops, but they weren't likable at all and they're introduced about three-fourth's into the film, seeming like they've come straight out of another movie. So all in all, the good things: The acting. The script. The bad things? The direction. The editing. And I'm sorry, that ending too! What cheese!",,Anonymous,Romance
This Movie's Nuts,"Revisiting Tony Scott's True Romance for the first time since somewhere in the throes of high school, I find that, as a lifelong Tarantino admirer, everything that tends to annoy me about Tarantino is more evident here than in any of the films he directed himself. And yet what is also evident is what shocked critics and audiences about Tarantino's work that jumpstarted the new generation of movies. There is an unhinged, guileless relatability to his material. Everything he writes is so rich and ripe. True Romance, nevertheless, implodes on itself. It is so inundated with homage, references and explosively gruesome set pieces that it seems to obliviously waltz right past countless opportunities for real drama so that it can continue on its path of totally, completely external and over-the-top narrative clockwork.You see, when I was 12, I could invest myself in Clarence and Alabama's romance, because I felt like a Clarence, just like a lot of 12-year-old boys who watch a lot of movies. So that's how I fantasized that it would be one day, that we suddenly happen upon the perfect beautiful buxom blonde hooker who likes whatever we like, and worships us from then on. I'm 21 now. Perhaps the least interesting thing to me now is the eponymous romance. Like the relationship between Catherine Deneuve and Susan Sarandon in director Tony Scott's first film The Hunger, the dimension to Clarence and Alabama's is too entrenched in male fantasy to be completely convincing. And let's not get so carried away with these theories about Clarence picking up where Travis Bickle left off. It's not exactly a ridiculous or even invalid theory, but let's look at what Clarence really is, which is why so many guys respond to this movie: He is in some way how we see ourselves when we are preteens and (successfully) acts upon all of the sexual or violent or adventurous fantasies that obsess him and derive from an overwhelming intake of popular culture.This is clearly exemplified when Clarence goes to kill his new wife's pimp, specifically acknowledging that he is haunted by the fact that he's breathing the same air as him and getting away with it every day, that he doesn't deserve to live. Revenge and retribution take the thematic cake in the QT canon. In each Tarantino script, something goes awry in the life of some cruel, brutal and violent men due to the intentional actions, or farcical negligence, of other people. Brutal and violent behavior ensues, and yet there are glimpses of compassion and morality among the tough, cruel and depraved people that populate them, according to their own self-conscious universe. True Romance is the epitome.The best thing about the movie by far is its renegade structure of reserving entire self-contained scenes for characters who we haven't seen before and won't see much after, interacting with another character who's been introduced already and probably won't live to see his third scene. The pinnacle of the effectiveness of Tarantino's free-wheeling narrative feature is the much-discussed scene between Christopher Walken and Dennis Hopper. In eight pages of dialogue, Walken delivers every line so coolly, with Hopper not much with which to answer except ""What are you talking' about?"" and ""I don't believe you."" But Walken creepily alternates between cruelty and empathy. Then when he slides in for the knockout, it turns out to be a cool, jaw-dropping rope-a-dope. The two veterans' attentiveness is unreserved, their performances candid, so they just lean back and Scott's camera catches them every time, never letting them fall.Overall though, it's ultimately all dressed up with nowhere to go, only really indicating how it's supposed to be read through intertextual links with other films. Each character and plot strand is either transplanted from vintage plot formulas, specific films, or classic character and scene stereotypes. Characters don't relate to the world in any manner except through celebrity idols, movies, music or character embodiments emerging straight from those very worlds. Natural Born Killers achieved a traumatic degree of satire with such material, but True Romance takes itself very seriously, indulging it exactly what Stone held up to horrifying censure, much to its writer's odd chagrin. It's a soap opera hiding in the Heroic Bloodshed genre wrapped in a Badlands homage with exploitation dressing.Tony Scott, the ultimate post-MTV filmmaker, has always worked exclusively in the commercial American industry. His films have always been unabashed business and mostly within the action/thriller genres. He's certainly not as mercenary as Michael Bay, and his choice of projects is more interesting. Regardless, he places emphasis on slick, high-concept narratives while drawing heavily from the diffused, neon-tinged visual style of music videos and commercials, complete with rapid-fire editing and prominent rock soundtracks. True Romance is no exception, and he retains his own familiar quick cuts, colored filters and swanky production design while achieving the allusive pop culture awareness of its writer's own directorial work. It's a big, fat pop culture chocolate cake. And just like regular chocolate cake, the older we get, the more we start to appreciate treats of nutritional value.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Truly Great Movie----8/10,"This movie proves that Quentin Tarantino knows how to write cool movies. There is a lot of violence but you actually care about the characters. You hope and pray through every shootout that they will get out alive. The story follows a an average joe in Detroit who falls for pretty girl named Alabama. After he rescues her from her pimp, they go on the run. Christian Slater, Patricia Arquette, Dennis Hopper and Christopher Walken all kick major ass in this movie directed by another great director, Tony Scott. This is a movie for everyone because it mixes action, suspense, romance, and drama all in one little package. And that is why Quentin Tarantino rules. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Good God !,"This is one of the finest movies ever made. It has action, mystery, AND romance blended together perfectly. This is one of those movies that will make your jaw drop from the beginning and captivate your all too willing attention throughout. The romance isn't corny like in Armageddon..it is the kind of love we all long for in our idealistic youth. I don't collect movies but I bought this (and 3 other videos) just so that I could keep the emotions this film inspired close to me.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Snowflakes and kittens, warm woolen mittens!","I watched this film for the frist time as a 17 year old civil servant. 3 weeks later i was in drama school pretending to be a tree and writing bad plays. The whole thing kinda fizzled out after about five years study, a couple of qualifications and the nagging suspicion that i stank at being artistic. But the begining remained, the joy i felt at knowing that something could be crafted that had the ability to change someones world and the decision to embrace it entirely. True Romance quite simply rocks. The cameos, the monalogues the grrrl power the style and charachters the words and wit. In a quote  "" I like this film Clarence. Always have, always will.""",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
I haven't killed anybody...since 1984,"This is one of the best Quentin Tarantino film that he did not direct. It has the charisma and violence of RESERVOIR DOGS and PULP FICTION. Even if you're not a Christian Slater fan (I'm not), you will still like this movie. This is a very well written piece of work by Quentin Tarantino. The chemistry between Patricia Arquette and Christian Slater is top notch. Gary Oldman is brilliant as usual in his role as a pimp. Brad Pitt is equally brilliant in one of his first roles as a stoner dude.And the #1 reason to see this film. Christopher Walken plays a mob boss. He is on screen for about 10 minutes. He has one of the best dialouges with Dennis Hopper that I have ever seen in film history. This movie is worth seeing just for the 10 minutes Christopher Walken and Dennis Hopper are on screen together.If you like the other QT movies (PULP FICTION and RESERVOIR DOGS), you will absolutely love this film. Tony Scott (DAYS OF THUNDER, TOP GUN, THE FAN) pulls all the shots out behind the camera.I would recommend the Special Edition DVD, which has the very bizarre alternate ending.Rating: 8 out of 10",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Tarantinos Best Script,"I know that all the great stories and movies that Quentin Tarantino has written and made have been nothing short of brilliant, but i think the best story/script that he has ever done is True Romance. Not necessarily everybody knows that he wrote it too. It is so brilliant and The story is so original. Im not saying that Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs aren't, but think about all the genres that are rolled into one here. Theres love, comedy, drama, violence, crime, mafia, drugs, hollywood, and the list goes on and on. I think that it may be one of the top 5-10 best screenplays ever written. Also, aside from the writing, the casting is superb. I mean we have Christian Slater (his best role), Patricia Arquette, Dennis Hopper, Christopher Walken, Gary Oldman, Samuel Jackson, Tom Sizemore, Val Kilmer, Brad Pitt, James Gandolfini (the role that pretty much had Tony Soprano written all over it) and other great actors. When you put a lot of marquis actors in a movie, it doesnt always work out because sometimes its just too much, but in this movie, their appearances in the movie are all balanced out that it works. I mean Christopher Walken is only in the movie for about 10 minutes and in that 10 minutes, he has the most memorable scene in the movie. Same goes for Gary Oldman. Tony Scott's directing is also remarkable. All in all, if you haven't seen this movie in a while or havent at all, rent it, buy it, order it, or whatever means of movie purchase you are accostomed to, and enjoy it because i think that it is a true classic. You literally will laugh, cry, and cringe, but most importantly, you will be satisfied......10/10.",,Anonymous,Romance
boy meets girl with a pinch of salt,"this should be renamed truly superb. great idea, great cast, great music, great shots. the real strong point of this film is the music composed by hans zimmer. in terms of music composers zimmer is in a league of his own. the storyline is very typical of Tarantino with all the crime plot and gorey scenes you need. one thing that tony scott does a lot is use tilted camera angles when someone is lying on the floor. this works very well. the most famous cast members are all really in cameo roles. christopher walken only appears in one scene (a great scene with dennis hopper) and you never see val kilmar's face. gary oldman and brad pitt don't play big roles in fact brad pitt's character (a complete stoner) isn't very relevent to the story. there is only one thing that lets this film down. sometimes Christian slater talks to quietly and quickly for you to understand whats going on. other than that this is arguably better than pulp fiction.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Tarantino and Scott give us an instant classic,"""True Romance"" from 1993, directed by Tony Scott and written by Quentin Tarantino, is an electrifying rollercoaster of romance, violence, crime, and unforgettable characters, blending comedic moments throughout. The film stands as a bold testament to Tarantino's signature dialogue stylings, with sharp, witty exchanges that crackle with energy and reveal deep layers of each character's desires and motivations. Christian Slater delivers a career-defining performance as Clarence, a charming yet naive comic book store clerk who embarks on a passionate, violent journey to protect his beloved Alabama, played with fiery intensity by Patricia Arquette. Their whirlwind love affair, set against a backdrop of colorful, morally ambiguous characters and locations, is nothing short of mesmerizing, capturing the essence of impulsive romance in all its chaos and beauty. The star-studded supporting cast includes Dennis Hopper, Gary Oldman, Christopher Walken, Val Kilmer, James Gandolfini, and Brad Pitt, who all bring vibrant depth to the film, each performance adding to the movie's gritty charm. Scott's dynamic, layered direction, paired with Hans Zimmer's hauntingly atmospheric score, creates a perfect visual and emotional synergy, making this a thrilling, heartfelt ride that's both a homage to, and a subversion of, the classic Hollywood love story. This is a movie that transcends any single genre, and is filled with unexpected treasures to discover within. All that and so much more, makes this a very special film, and eminently rewatchable.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
the best Tarantino movie not made by Tarantino,"I believe that there is such a genre called 'the Tarantino movies'. They have a story which is usually a gangster story, but not necessarily. Men in the story are teenagers or they all have teenagers minds, they are addicted to comics and pulp fiction, they love cinema if cinema was invented when the action takes place, there must be a scene in a cinema theater or at least in front of a TV set in these films. Girls are gorgeous and hookers. Morality plays an important role, but is of a special kind. There is a lot of violence in this films, so well filmed that viewers know it's not true and they have fun watching it. Martial arts are the real art.Some of the Tarantino films are made by Quentin Tarantino. Some other not. 'True Romance' is not, but it's written by Tarantino, it was made 20 years ago but looks as fresh as if it was made yesterday, which shows that the genre beyond other qualities also has the one of aging nicely. It's a gangster story, it's a love story, it's a crime comedy about a young couple semi-willingly becoming murderers and unwillingly becoming drug dealers, it's a road movie, it's a movie about Hollywood. And it's fun to watch.There are so many good things in this film that I have a hard time picking which one to list. Dialogs and the musical score (Hans Zimmer - see the list of the films he composed for at IMDb and you will understand why you loved even more some of the best films in Hollywood in the last 30 years) are exquisite. Acting is stellar with the lead exception of Christian Slater which I simply cannot force myself to like. Lucky me, he is paired in the film with Patricia Arquette, and then we have Dennis Hopper, Brad Pitt, James Gandolfini, Christopher Walke, Gary Oldman ... wow ... each of them in supporting roles hard to forget.The director of this film is Tony Scott, who died last year. He was among these directors who would never get an Oscar because he just made the films that pleased the crowds. 'True Romance' is however much more than a crowd-pleaser, it may be T.Scott's best and one of the best Tarantino films ever made.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
This film is .....,".... utterly contrived,ridiculously implausible and totally brilliant. Simply the best film l have ever seen; from the story, the script, the cast, the acting, the location, to the sound track it is flawless and the definition of cool. The film is considered over estimated by some, but for me it has everything; drama, comedy, tension, action and a love story, and to get caught up in the plot flaws is to lose the point of the tale. I cant add anything that hasn't already been said about the scene between Christopher Walken & Dennis Hopper but if there is a finer scene in any film, l have yet to see it.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Brilliant and Awkard Masterpiece,"This is not a movie I'd expect to be widely loved. It is dark, extremely violent, unfiltered amd so politically incorrect it couldn't be made today and it's hard to believe it was made even in the early 90s.But the film was so raw and intense, it gripped anyone who ever saw it and literally hemmed any viewer into a dark nasty world full of racism, violence and desperation that was never expressed so candidly,Regardless of whether you liked it or hated it, it was unforgettable. The acting was very good, but will be immortalized by the Hopper/Walken scene and Gary Oldman holding the thin line separating caricature and character.The dialogue holds through time as some of QT's rawest and most ambitious to this day and will not be attempted again. It was fully 1990s in origin and at a time when the limit to morality was being stretched to its fullest for the first time since the 70sGreat film, but be careful who you recommend this film to.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
It makes you laugh,"As Tarantino movie ( here script) all of this is great compatabile and funny.Lot of admire for director Tony Scott who created many fantastic and one of my favourite movie ( Spy Game, Man on Fire, Deja Vu,Fan, Beverly Hills Cop)
Nice plot, nice details specialy last scene in hotel room with all team- that was really cool and funny. Emilio was acting exactly like Serge from Beverly Hills cop and Alabama was laughing on couch just like another actors. They got really great fun.Lovely Brad Pitt role, Gary Oldman- just like bizzar drug dealer from Leo- profesional. Little part of Samuel L. Jackson.Hans Zimmer music. Pink cadilac. Elvis Presley and ninja stuff. All of this making nice 2hs entertainment and laughing.Marvelous piece of art. Worth seeing.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
A hard-hitting movie with a John Woo ending even Shakespeare would love...,"Ah, True Romance, what a truly excellent film, I don't even know where to begin. The dialogue alone is worthy of an Oscar in my opinion, from Elvis to Sonny Chiba, Sicilians and Charles Bronson, this movie has it all. Although it's not for all tastes, the main characters are a loser and an ex-call girl who somehow find each other under crazy circumstances, the story will definitely keep you watching. The ensemble is chock full of actors in roles you would never guess, Brad Pitt as a pothead, Gary Oldman as a pimp, as well as terrific performances from all. To me this movie combined some of Tony Scott's best direction and Tarantino's best writing.  To sum it up: It's a hard-hitting movie with a John Woo ending even Shakespeare would love; IT KICKED ASS.",,Anonymous,Romance
A film gem,"This film is a gem, perhaps some sort of classic. The dialogue between Christopher Walken and Dennis Hopper in  Clifford Worley's trailer is a brilliant example of screen writing and acting. It may well be superior to Tarantino's Pulp Fiction.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Reservoir Dogs-GOOD    Pulp Fiction-GREAT   True Romance-EXCELLENT,"This perfect cast takes you on a rollercoaster ride from start to finish. From the small roles of Samuel L Jackson, the then UNKNOWNS Tom Sizemore&James Gandolfini, Dennis Hopper, Christopher Walken, Brad Pitt and Gary Oldman (Kim Basinger received a best supporting  actress award for her tiny role in LA CONFIDENTIAL, so how come Oldman didn't get a supporting actor award  for this film, he was AWESOME)to the main characters, Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette, this movie doesn't miss a single beat. The dialogue is superb, going from hilarious to gutwrenching and vice versa in a split second. This movie has it all, and if it sounds like I am saying it doesn't get any better than ""True Romance"" than you would be right, it doesn't....",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
one of the most memorable films,"there are some films, which you may come back over the years.  You remember some scenes, or lines of dialogue when talking with friends.  This is surely one of such films.  Such a huge cast, such a nice story and a very easy flow of moments.  I truly recommend one particular scene to everyone. The scene between Dennis Hopper and Christopher Walken.  Everything about that scene is great, almost monumental moment of cinema history.  If you don't have the time to watch the whole film, which is a real pity, at least pay attention for 5 minutes to watch this scene.oh, by the way, almost forgotten, one of the top credits for this film surely goes to Tarantino.  No one else could have written this better.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
