Brave,"Nice movie, not the best Pixar movie, but I really enjoyed watching it. Merida was a good character. Her relationship with her mother was excellent. The message of the film was excellent.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
The CGI was incredible!,"While I must admit that ""Brave"" is not among my favorite Pixar films, I was totally blown away by the computer graphics. To some extent this is to be expected--as years pass, the CGI is bound to get better and better. But it's more than that--the textures, colors and depth were all incredible and I was in love with the animation throughout.As far as the story goes, it was a mixed bag. While I was thrilled to see a Pixar film with female leads AND featuring a mother-daughter relationship, the story itself seemed a bit shallow and flat. It wasn't bad, but never hit that emotional spot within that you'd find in ""Up"" or ""Toy Story 3"". Now this isn't to say it's bad---it just isn't among the very best of the studio and is STILL well worth seeing. It's especially nice to see a FEMALE protagonist--and one who does NOT need to be rescued by a prince! Incidentally, my daughter and her friend loved the film--and my bet is that girls would generally prefer this film but it's a lot of fun for everyone.By the way, there is a cute inside joke in the film in which they mention someone being out of town at the ""Wicker Man"" ceremony! This could be a reference to the wonderful 1970s film (see this one--not the remake) or to the actual ancient ceremony. I actually had no idea that this was a real event until dlwagner sent me an email informing me of this--but I certainly did NOT expect to hear them talking about it in ""Brave"".",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
A Visual Feast and a Solid Pixar Film,"Brave is a beautiful and moving new fairy tale that fits seamlessly into the genre; Princess Merida is a wonderfully multi-facted heroine; the film shapes itself around problems that are familiar and understandable and will be well-understood and appreciated by kiddos and parents alike; the supporting characters that are given the most attention are well-crafted (but too bad for those others that fall by the wayside). The visual effects are flawless, in my opinion, the best if all Pixar films.Brave is at its best when it's smartly and charmingly changing what we think think a Disney Princess can be, but it wavers when it tries to somehow reinvent the Pixar wheel. The film lacks the trademark Pixar wit we've come to expect from the animation studio's productions, and some humor feels shoe-horned in for the sake of having some laughs; the directorial kerfuffle that took place in the middle of production is not overwhelmingly obvious, but there is a distinct laugh of singular vision driving the film and its tone wavers throughout.It may not live up to the incredible standards of the Pixar brand, but Brave offers young audiences a lot of entertainment and adventure. Highly Recommended.8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Great,"A true best of both worlds for classic Disney and classic Pixar fans. It had already been many years since the acquisition, but for me this was the first time Disney's buyout felt like a positive direction for the animation pioneers. Filled with possibly Pixar's most attractive environments, character designs (Side note: Merida has my favorite character design of any animated human character. I mean seriously her hair alone is a thing of beauty.), and easily its best score, the studio does a deft send up of classic princess movies while instilling the pure feeling of magic they are known for though Scotland's rich Celtic lore and cryptic mysticism. Brave is a criminally underrated installment in the Pixar cannon that I hope grows in stature over the years. If Wreck It Ralph is Disney doing Pixar, Brave is Pixar doing Disney.",,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
"Pixar's latest effort enchants us with stunning visuals, and charismatic characters, but misses the X factor that makes Pixar film's great","This should have been an easy review to write. Brave should have been a film that cemented itself as one of the all time greats, a necessary addition to any Top Films list. It should have been a film that claimed a place in our hearts as so many other Pixar films have in the past. But it's not. And writing this review is proving anything but easy. It's hard because I'm sitting at my Dell Latitude feeling bewildered at how a film from the best animation studio in the world left me feeling lukewarm at best.A bit of background on the film first; this film went through two directors. After Brenda Chapman left the film for reasons I don't know, Mark Andrews was hired as a shoe in. This wasn't the first Pixar film to have multiple directors, just unplanned multiple directors. This is where my major problem with this film stems. Everything from Brenda Chapman is textbook Pixar class and charisma, but once Mark Andrews gets the reins (and you WILL know when it happens), the film takes an abrupt and uncomfortable shift towards the dark, and really challenges the boundaries of PG. It feels like two different films tacked on to one another with Gorilla Glue, it's as if the directors had no collaboration with each other. A real shame because up until it takes this dark turn, the rest of this film is a class act bursting with potential.However to lament on the pitfalls is to ignore the positives. Pixar created two characters with copybook classic credentials in Princess Merida, and her father Fergus. Merida as the independent, self-confident, inurbane princess has a tongue-in-cheek charm and a personality that brings a genuine smile to your face. The other hero of character is Fergus, his character of a bumbling king with an overpowering queen is cliché, but he's executed brilliantly and is the provider of the majority of humor on Brave. Another immensely impressive aspect is its supremely dazzling animation aesthetics, the resplendent beauty of the Scottish countryside sometimes stealing scenes from its characters. Whether or not you agree that's brilliant is more subjective.Now this may seem like the ranting of a spoilt wannabe movie critic weaned on delusions of grandeur, and hollow satisfaction from demeaning films with hype behind them, but I can assure you my size 10.5s remain firmly on the ground. This film is still a damn sight better than a majority of animated films out there, and it no doubt sets a new bar for animation quality other films won't be able to reach without a pole vault. I generally like this film and its good moments are plentiful and remind you why we love these films so much. Pixar films are utterly infectious when done correctly, Brave isn't up to the standards of their best, you won't fall in love with it, but forget the scale of its predecessors and you'll definitely be impressed by it.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Beautiful movie,"What a fantastic film that has gotten such a terrible backlash.Reasons for backlash:1)People hate princess films and according to them it is the same as the others. Well anyone with an iota of intelligence will tell you that each princess film has a different story, a different message and a different but ever so present soul. We live in a society where two characters who have the same hair color and different faces and different personalities are viewed by the masses of people to be identical and the same person because people are superficial and so this film has a princess and that one SINGLE fact makes the film the SAME as all other princess films. Oh how intelligence has plummeted.2) This is story about tradition and myth. That is part of the core of the tale. We live in a society with no tradition or real culture other than pop culture. So obviously the turmoil of the leads will go over the heads of the masses. I have friends who have been in situations where they were forced to marry someone and refusal to do so would have ghastly consequences for their families. It is real and heart breaking. In our society however people sleep with a hundred people before and even after marriage and can marry and divorce as they please without giving a rat's ass for their families who could suffer the brunt of their decisions. We live in a selfish society so obviously putting ourselves in the shoes of or even imagining what Merida and her mother go through and their reasons will not register with millions. No one will understand how breaking tradition could have disastrous consequences. They have no idea how in other countries how tradition and culture is a backbone of societies other than ours. people cannot in our society put themselves into the shoes of others as we are too selfish. And that is the truth.3) This story has legends and stories, myths, tales that guide our heroines. In a society without stories that date thousands of years, cautionary tales and tales of truths to guide us, i doubt the impact of that will reach the minds of the public. Though abroad many and i mean many nations have tales, legends that date back thousands of years before our country received its name. These tales would guide people and be sources of moral and brainy wisdom for the children and adults. So obviously that went over everyone's heads. People in other countries hundreds upon hundreds of years ago used these legends and myths, these tales, to grow as a people.And to this day people in such countries still tell these tales to their kids as a moral message, teaching and preventing history from occurring.4) Apparently it has no humor and people want humor over substance. I mean anyone seen The Hangover trilogy. Well people loved it as it shows what society is all about and that is public mindset.5) It is about a mother-daughter story, it has moral messages and a lot of deep meaning. Apparently that means it is 'cliché'. What an overused word by the pseudo intellectual pretentious idiots who lack profound sense and think substance and sweetness is cliché just because they are sick douches. Half the time they don't even know what it means. I mean these days the word cheesy is used to describe anything with substance, sweetness, kindness, soul and love. And so something with profound wisdom and sheer lovely heart is considered cheesy while on the other hand depraved psycho disgusting buffoonery is considered amazing. Oh how far moral and substance has fallen in this society and how pretentious pseudo-intellect has taken over. Wisdom and profound thought and substance is dead or according to the depraved superficial and supposedly know it all generation 'cheesy'. Our society is so egoistic and full of itself that it cannot be educated or told great messages since according to them, they know everything and no one should dare question that by putting a real message in a movie. Even if these people know nothing they still must be considered to be the greatest and smartest. People hate their families or have been so poorly raised and some in favor of pets or vice versa where pets are considered better family than people so obviously their hate for the real meaning of life and family and love which they look down upon is 'cheesy' and 'cliche'. Well that is society for you and i hope that great movies with substance don't get the boot in favor of what such people want.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
A quality change of fate for Pixar,"Everything about Brave is different from the Pixar norm, save the unequaled attention to detail and quality.The Disney-Pixar animated feature focuses on Princess Merida as she searches for a way to change her fate. In a journey of magic, adventure and family, the fiery Scot is launched into the ranks of the elite Disney princesses.As odd and understandably foreign as the accents felt watching the early previews for the movie, the voice acting was executed following, creating very real characters that fit their animated molds perfectly. By the end of the movie, what once sounded foreign blended into the scenery and visuals to create a completely immersing environment.In fact, amid the magic spells and tall tales of times gone by, it's the historical, Scottish feeling that made Marida's journey and transformation (and that of her mother) that much more tangible and familiar.Underneath the folk-tale storyline lies the same life lessons that ring true for young and old. Though the movie heavily focuses on a mother- daughter relationship, it's not just for girls anymore than Mulan was. Merida is a true Disney princess, with gumption, heart and an uncanny connection with nature, but the story could have been told from a male perspective and rung just as true, making it easy to empathize with Pixar's first female lead.As has been the case with almost every other one of their movies, the company has reinvented the standard for animated visuals. The environments are based on real Scottish landmarks, adding real depth to the story, and the colors are as bright as they are grounded, creating a wonderfully real world. Such visuals lend credence to the upcoming 3D re-release of Finding Nemo, though not much, but also show just how far the studio has come.All of the elements put together, Brave is a different sort of movie than many were expecting. More focused on a single pair and their quest together, not to mention darker by far, the story of Merida was a leap of faith for the once small studio.Many will have their doubts, left wanting another heart wrenching love story from Up or creative take on a beat to death genre like The Incredibles. That was never the purpose. Just as with every one of their award-winning films (Cars 2 notwithstanding), a new movie means a new chapter, new story and new style of film.Taken for what it is, Brave is a remarkable step into a whole new style of movie, proving the creative teams at Pixar will continue to write their own fate.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Another Great Pixar Film,"Brave is a film I've been looking forward to since I first laid eyes on it's beautiful trailer. It had everything a great Pixar film has: a wonderful setting, fantastic CGI, beautiful and interesting characters, and a lot of heart. In fact, Merida alone was such an interesting and adorable character, that it was instantly on my to watch list. Granted, this isn't Pixar's best, but that's holding it up to extremely high standards. As an animated film, however, this is a fantastic and fascinating film, a treat for the summer.Brave tells the story of the aforementioned Merida, a young, Scottish princess whose life is controlled by her mother so that she can be shaped into a queen someday over the surrounding tribes. In an effort to change her fate and be free of her oppressive, but loving mother, she attempts to change her fate, and in the process makes a huge mistake. I won't get into plot details, as the trailer really doesn't give a lot away in terms of what this film is really about, but suffice to say, there is plenty of fun and adventure to be had.Pixar always manages to create an interesting and unique tale, and this goes right up there with the best of them. Using the Scottish highlands is both an inspiring choice and allows them to craft a beautiful film. With sweeping mountains, water, and thick and colorful forests, this is one of Pixar's best looking films to date. It trumps the jungles of UP and even the magical underwater world of Finding Nemo. There is a certain amount of magic in the environments alone, and gazing on it is a wonder. The characters are also fantastic. Merida is a wonderful addition to Disney's princess lineup, and unlike those others, she is no damsel in distress. She, like her mother, is perfectly capable of handling herself, with her trusty archery skills and even tackles a few dangerous situations on her own instead of having someone there to save her. In fact, this could be seen as an inverse, as Merida actually becomes a hero in many ways and triumphs over the males in her own age bracket. Also of note is Billy Connolly, voicing Fergus, who lends his comedic chops to create a wonderful and likable character.While this film may not be up there with Pixar's best, it still has a wonderful story and character interaction. Merida's relationship with her family feels genuine and most children will probably be able to relate. At the heart of the story is her relationship with her mother. This is more than a story about fate, but a story about obligations to family and how growing up means taking responsibility and putting away childish selfishness in place of those responsibilities. Although the core plot is unconventional and unexpected, it has a fantastic heart and once again proves that Pixar can tell a story like no other.Brave is an entertaining, humorous, and heartfelt story that will be wonderful for kids and adults alike. Merida is a wonderful new character and the entire film looks beautiful. Even if you don't have children, I recommend this film if you've loved other Pixar's before it.",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
A Brave New Film From Pixar,"There's quite a bit about Brave that has marked it as a departure from Pixar's typical fare. The most memorable trailer was one of the best scenes from the movie, with Merida protesting her marriage by shooting for her own hand. That scene alone showcases the detail and quality of animation we've come to expect from Pixar. No other studio has managed to come near what they do. The motion of the characters is natural. Merida's gorgeous curly red hair is distracting in its details only at the perfect times. And, most impressively, when Merida holds her breath to shoot her last arrow the audience holds its collective breath as we watch her arrow shoot away in slow motion and in a beautiful use of depth of field that reminds us why 2D is still highly preferred to 3D.That's not to say Brave is quite as visually astonishing as Sully's fur in Monsters Inc., the magical underwater world of Finding Nemo, or a landfill laden Earth in Wall-E. But, in some ways, it's not meant to be. We're dealing with a primarily human cast for once, and ones meant to look very different than the ones in Up.Beyond the animation, the story is somewhat flat. The trailers do an excellent job of concealing the twists, but the twists are all easy to see well ahead of time. The story revolves around Princess Merida who is continually at odds with her Mother, Elinor. At the center of their arguments: marriage. Merida is to be married to the first born of one of the leaders of the other three clans. She'll have none of it as she'd much rather ride off on her own and perfect her archery skills than sit at home and be a proper Princess. In her more childish qualities, she's like her father: an overgrown warrior child who also happens to be King. It's not a bad story, but it's certainly a little too basic. Most people will most likely find the lack of creativity in the script's details the biggest disappointment in Brave. There's no moments where we marvel ""how did these guys come up with this?""It's a pity because Merida is one of the best protagonists Pixar has been blessed with. She's likable and hate-able in all the right ways. She has quite a bit of bratty teenager in her - as evidenced by the lack of morality she displays in trying to change her mother's mind about her upcoming betrothal - and yet heaps of bravery - as she shows when confronted with what she's done to her Mother. The best part about Merida and the story is that she's the one continually driving it forward and making the choices. That proves vital as the film doesn't really have a villain. This isn't a good vs. evil battle like all their other movies not named Finding Nemo.Brave falls somewhere in the middle for Pixar. It's great that it's original (especially with Pixar selling out and giving us Monster's Inc. 2 and Toy Story 4 shortly), it's great the protagonist is female and so well rounded, and it's great the animation is somewhat subdued for once. I can't help but feel that Brave lacks some of the magic and creativity that really separate the upper echelon of Pixar's best work from the rest of it. Of course, that'll still probably be enough to make it the best animated movie of the year.For more reviews like this one as well as other movie musings, go to http://thethreeacts.wordpress.com/",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Amazing movie. Completely underestimated.,"After last years Cars 2, many began to underestimate Pixar and believed that it would begin to fall out of the radar. Well this movie will definitely prove them wrong. This movie was a visually stunning masterpiece with a great story. Even before the movie started it was exciting because of the unique and creative short La Luna along with the Monsters University teaser trailer.

recommended for ages 6+,"I watched this movie in 3D with my (very mature for his age) five year old grandson. He loved it and wanted to talk about the plot for most of the afternoon to anyone who would listen. However, other young children in the theatre were rather nervous and scared in certain parts of the film and a few very small (2 - 4 year old) children had to be escorted out of the cinema by their parents.Personally, after the first five minutes, which were a bit slow, I became absorbed in the story and thoroughly enjoyed the movie. There was lots of action and the plot was attention grabbing and unique, with no soppy love story and little slang included.",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
"Meh, same old foolish guys and awesome girls","Once you get past the accents and the stunning scenery there is not much of a story.I can't believe the ""female heroine"" still gets buzz as original. When was the last time a kids show had a male hero that wasn't in some way arrogant needing to be knocked down a notch (Tangled, Cars,Buzz Lightyear etc)or a weak anti-hero that realizes he needs help (Woody, Nemo's Dad, etc.Make a movie with a classic male hero and that would be mold breaking. If movie makers stop treating female audiences as if they are so fragile they could not stand a guy with confidence or deserving confidence, that would be original.The cliché is that the female characters are always perfect except just a bit too spunky.",6.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
A Celtic Tale to the Core,"I was lucky enough to see this film in a movie with other paying customers. There was a liberal dose of children in the audience who, from the sounds of happiness during the showing, was proof that it should be a solid hit. Add to that a dreamy-eyed little boy of about 8 who said to me after the film, ""I gotta get me a bow and arrow!"" That's about as good a testimony as you could get.I had heard a mention from a source or two - who should remain nameless - that they had trouble with the direction the story went or that it may have been too simplistic. First, I vividly recall people complaining that the story for UP! Was too com0plex, too adult, for a kids movie. But kids liked it anyway. So, they made the story simpler this time and there are complaints from other people. You can't have it both ways. Some people would even complain if they were hanged with a new rope.What this story does try to do is present a flavor of the Highland Scots in the middle ages. Hollywood being what it is, it's certainly not historically accurate in every detail, but my word, was the animation superb! It was simply magnificent in the depth and complexity. The star, Merida's, hair certainly had center stage a lot. I loved it! Such a riotous bouquet of autumn beauty is hard to find in real life, although I have to say I have a friend of long acquaintance who's hair is EXACTLY like Merida's. My only complaint about that character is with that coloring she screamed with the need for freckles! That would have made her visually perfect to type and character and the absence really disappointed me.Second, as to the story elements; I feel certain that there are few places on earth with a rich a history of mythical and magical creatures; all of which were taken quite seriously and believed without doubt. The old stories are replete with such tales containing Druids, witches, soothsayers, faeries, brownies, ùruisg, gruagach, little people, silkies, water horses, banshees, Bean-shìdh, kelpies, Blue Kelpies, Seonaidh's, Changelings, Wulvers (a sort of kindly werewolves), Will-o'-the-wisps, Nuckelavees (a quite monstrous elf) and on and on. All of which goes to say that this animated film rests smack in the center of an ancient and rich culture and does it some justice, not in overreaching accuracy, but certainly in underlining the look and feel of the land and the people.I loved it, my daughter loved it and my grandkids loved it (it didn't hurt that this grouping contains several people with red hair). We loved the look of the people, the costumes, the sets - especially the forested ones and the wonderful voices! Billy Connolly, Kelly Macdonald and Emma Thompson all did a wonderful job.Oh, yeah, my 5 year-old grandson wants the girl ... ;) By Bruce L.

Great movie,"Its quite a good movie. I don't know why so many people are dissatisfied with it. Merida's character has been put up beautifully. Its an amazing movie if you want to show a movie to your kids. Something a family can lay back and enjoy. The animation is quite good. What impresses is the strong character of Merida and Elinor. The mother-daughter bonding is spectacular. And no matter what others say, the story line is quite different. You won't regret watching this movie. In quite a few occasions the animation is very realistic, never seen so much precision. If you are wondering whether to watch this movie, don't hesitate. Go ahead, its worth watching.",6.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
A Great Movie.. But not 'Pixar' Great...,"I am a great fan of Pixar studios, so I'm trying to be as unbiased as I can while writing this review. Brave sure does mark a comeback to Pixar. After Cars 2, many thought that the beloved animation studio lost its vibe and magic, but this movie proves everyone wrong. I mean it. Pixar is back. But... The movie is not extra-ordinary or marvelous like Up or Wall-e. Its great, but not in a 'Pixar' kind of way. But then again, the movie is much different from the usual Pixar style of movie-making, which might be the reason why I made the previous point.Firstly, the visuals. I mean, come on, no one beats Pixar when it comes to Animation and visual effects. And this time, the studio has really outdone itself. Brave should probably be the greatest animation work of Pixar up to date. The Characters, the ancient Scotland, the Artwork, the Scenery, you name it. It was splendid. Even the voices were perfectly cast. Kelly McDonald was very convincing as Merida and so was the case with everyone else. Also, I loved the way she spoke in her Scottish accent.Talking about the story, it sounded more like a Disney story than a Pixar one. It was, of course, the darkest Pixar tale so far and even the jokes got a little matured this time around. And I have to say this, though. The message the movie gives about freedom and family was very good. You may not actually appreciate it and get impressed as soon as you see it but once you see the movie and after a while you think of it, you'll start liking it. It did happen to me.I only have a few things against the movie, the first one being that the studio didn't reach its previous standards of story-telling. The second one was the pace, which was alright for most of the movie except for at the beginning of the second half. Also, I must have raised my expectations dramatically after watching the trailers, so probably I did get a little disappointed. But nevertheless, the movie is without doubt, a very good movie. Only, it's neither the best nor the worst of Pixar films. It dangles somewhere in the middle of the list.Also, there was a very beautiful short movie called La Luna at the beginning of the movie. By the way, 'If you had the chance to change you fate, would you?' This line is kind of cool. Who knew? You might find it useful someday.",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
"Pixar or no Pixar; Brave does have a few strengths, but a lot of flaws","First I want to start this review by saying that I'm not a Pixar fan. Frankly, I think Pixar is one of the most overrated companies ever. While they have churned out a few great films now and then (the first Toy Story, Finding Nemo, Up and yes, both Cars films), I've found most of their films to be quite adequate and unremarkable. Therefore I wasn't going into ""Brave"" expecting a so-called Pixar masterpiece. But rather a masterpiece on its own. While I had my doubts, I still hoped to be blown away. And while some parts lived up to my expectations, other parts did disappoint me.Despite that I'm lukewarm about most Pixar features, I shall admit that Pixar had really never made a bad movie (even Cars 2, which everyone seemed to despise, was quite enjoyable, despite its flaws). Brave doesn't fall into that category, but it's still without doubt one of Pixar's most flawed movies.To start with the positive aspects of this film; The animation is a definite top-notch. Lush, detailed and absolutely gorgeous. The cute and satisfying prologue is reminiscent of Disney's Dinosaur and Jurassic Park The Lost World. The score of Patrick Doyle is absolutely wonderful and the few songs are enjoyable as well. The Scottish accents give the film authenticity and the voices are perfect for the casts, especially Billy Connolly as Merida's goofy and fun-loving father, Fergus, which is the strongest character on the film.So where does the film fall flat? One word (an aspect which several reviewers and especially an early review of Ain't it Cool-News were pointing out); the narrative. The film lacks a consistent storyline. After a fairly satisfying thirty minutes, the film turns another direction and becomes another ""Brother Bear"", which is one of Disney's most flawed and insipid features, in my opinion. While Brave never becomes an identical copy of the bear movie, the similarities are obvious enough to make the non-fans cringe. For there on, the movie loses some of its spark, becomes less engaging and introduces the viewers to some plot points which are even more insipid and laughable.So how could I depict Brave as a whole? Its not a awful film, but it's indeed a frustrating one. How could a movie like this lack such a coherent narrative? While I don't find it as mediocre as Brother Bear, it's still less satisfying than what it could have been. But despite all these problems, I'm still giving Brave a few points for the positive aspects.",6.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Motherly Affection,"In Scotland, the rebel Princess Merida is a skilled archery raised by her mother Queen Elinor in accordance with the traditions of the Kingdom of Dun Broch. Her father King Fergus lost part of one of his legs eaten by the fearful bear Mar'du and dreams on slaying the animal.

Lord Dingwall, Lord MacGuffin and Lord Macintosh bring their sons to dispute the princess in a competition among them.Merida lures the first-born and flees to the forest where she meets a witch. She asks a spell to change her mother and the witch prepares a small cake to give to her. When her mother eats a slice of the cake, she is turned into a bear and Fergus mistakenly takes her as being Mor'du. Now Merida has to fix her spell but the witch has traveled and she has only one day to bring her mother back.""Brave"" is a highly entertaining animation from Disney / Pixar, with the enjoyable story of motherly affection, with a rebel princess that makes a wrong choice that serves to show her how much her mother loves her. There are funny moments, with the practical jokes of the three young brothers, the crow and the witch's broom, and the conclusion is well resolved. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Valente"" (""Brave"")",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
"Great Animation, not so great story","Animation is spectacular, great setting in the Scottish Highlands. Voice acting is above par. However, this movie is not among the top Pixar films, by far. I felt the sickening presence of Disney all over the film -- weird politically correct preaching, overdone action scenes, and generally random and weird plot.The story is really disappointing. What exactly makes her 'BRAVE'?? They should have named the movie 'PETULANT'. She's selfish, and the entire plot is about how she can get out of the results of her selfishness while remaining selfish. The magic feels out of place, lots of wasted scenes, and the whole bear thing was just plain annoying after a while.Not a lot of funny moments, and generally boring!

Engineering,"Steve Jobs remade Apple, embedding a very specific philosophy. Usually called 'design,' the idea is simple and the goal is simple. Have a vision of what you want to accomplish, a clear vision. Then engineer to that vision, ruthlessly eliminating all else. It sounds simple, but no Apple competitor has been able to emulate the approach; it is usual to start with a list of features and jam as many in as you can.Jobs had far less work to do with Pixar because they started as an engineering shop and ended up making movies. The stories are effective because they are carefully engineered, based not initially on intuition, but on the science (such as it is) of narrative dynamics. As Pixar matured, they started to engineer the cinematic techniques as well.Now Pixar is part of the Disney machine, and Disney has a princess franchise to feed, and I am sure that a very specific set of goals was supplied to Pixar to engineer to. So we have the story and the rather blunt girl-mother issues that apparently have market traction. You, dear viewer, will be in their scope and satisfied with the engineered results or not. I don't care much about that.What I do appreciate is the parallel engineering, the cinematic engineering. Pixar in the past has been experimenting with space, particularly the position occupied by the camera and the space that is defined around it. Lots of consideration of dimension that gives something like a visual score. Sometimes it directly supports the goals of the story; sometimes it does so indirectly by just making the images more enticing.I think what they did here is fascinating. The spatial experiments are muted, at least the space occupied by the action. Instead, the space around the chief character's head is engineered, no doubt using proprietary motion technology. You can see it in two recent Pixar patent applications (12/717,530 and 12/717,540) with the implementation here using NURBS rather than polygons. As a matter of hidden history, the technique of using linear NURBS to define things like hair came directly from military aircraft radiation modeling for stealth.But that is another story. What interests us here is the ability to both *realistically* emulate the effect that curls of hair have in gravity, wind jostling and rubbing up against each other, *and* the agent system where tufts to have some individual character and personality within the assembly. They are characters in their own filmworld. The more glum I got over the story-in- front, the more joy I was able to find in what they did with this hair. Some of the 1500 individual curls work against the assembly just as Merida works against her constraints.The personality of each of the tufts remains the same throughout the film, but the nature of the agentworld of the tufts develops.Because they have to emphasize the hair, they de-emphasize hair elsewhere. For instance, the bearhides are from a bygone technology. The snow that originally would have used the same technology and echoed the hair dynamics would have made a great film. But 'creative differences' and a shift in the director killed this.Red hair in cinema has a long history, and it can be said that film at least clarified certain stereotypes. I have a small project tracing the development from ""It!"" and following black and white films where the red was known from tinted fan magazines, through Technicolor. Many actresses were forced to dye their hair just so the filmstock would register their skin properly. By then we had the three main archetypes.Merida has a rare double swirl. Fantastic research on that account.So, an engineered hairworld, as a collection of characters, acting as a character to subvert the Disney constraints. Too bad about the original visionary leaving. Jobs would not have allowed it.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.",,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Solid fare in the old-school Disney tradition,"Brave, Pixar's new animated film, doesn't quite match its predecessors for whimsy, emotion, and awesomeness, but it's a pretty fine movie nonetheless. It has its scary parts, like most Disney movies, but the five year old who saw the movie with me wasn't scared one bit, so you probably won't be, either. But I don't know, she's kind of tough.Merida (voice of Kelly Macdonald) is the first-born princess in a mythical Scotland kingdom. Unlike most princesses, though, Merida is feisty, passionate, and more willing to shoot a bow and arrow than to be a demure little lady. Sort of the opposite of what her strict mother, Queen Elinor (voice of Emma Thompson) desires.The feud between headstrong mother and child comes to a head when the former announces there will be a huge party attended by the three other major clans, the head of each bringing along his first-born son to offer to Merida as a husband. It's tradition, of course. That tradition gets upended by Merida's unyielding will, and in her desperate defiance of her mother she encounters a witch (Julie Walters) who grants her a spell that will change Merida's destiny. Not an uncommon theme in these movies; the trouble is that the characters never seem to understand that changing a destiny doesn't mean it's changed for the better. In this case, Merida's destiny - not a spoiler here - is changed in that her mother becomes a bear. Hilarity ensues.All curses in movies, particularly in animated movies, have some kind of loophole. Here, it's that if Merida can repair a certain bond before two sunrises, she can reverse the spell; otherwise, dear old mum will be a bear forever. For a queen who hardly ever ventures outside her enormous castle, this is quite the fish-out-of-water dilemma.From an animation standpoint, Brave is elegant without being too flashy. It doesn't try to be overly realistic, with a tremendous attention to detail, like the earlier Pixar films had. Truth be told, the movie has much more of an old-time, traditionally animated Disney film than a new- wave Pixar movie. The movie is presented in 3D and in 2D, and I recommend the latter - if only because there are many dark scenes (in a forest, mostly) that will be rendered indiscernible in 3D, which vacuums light up. Some of the forest scenes are very pretty indeed, specifically those involving the appearance of the will o' the wisp, a spirit that helps Merida find that which she seeks.The movie is not without its fair share of humor, even slapstick. Merida's father, the King (voice of Billy Connolly) is a rough-and- tumble, huge, no-necked man who's just as soon drink a gallon of ale with you than break your nose. He's also missing a leg, the tale of which he never tires of telling, to the chagrin of his family. Merida also has three little brothers who, being boys, get away with anything they wish, while the poor princess must conform to strict rules of order. Ain't no fun being a princess, apparently.Brave is a modest movie by Pixar standards, but its plot is a little more enriched than those of its predecessors, with myths, legends, and oral traditions leading the way to, in some cases, more questions. Well, more questions if you're eight years old and want to know more about everyone's intentions. If you are eight years old and are reading this, congratulations - our schools has made you a learny person. In any event, the plot is simple on the surface but contains deeper layers of provocative intrigue, never a bad thing. Kids will either gloss over the details or will find them fascinating.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
A Simple Magic,"The reason why Pixar movies are so special not only because of the filmmaking but also because of their creative high concepts and their heartfelt messages. They have their own kind of magic. Brave has it all but it sometimes feel different. The story is good but the idea is not as mind boggling as their other films. The only thing remains intact here is the heart. Despite from all that, it's still a wonderful film. But some might still be disappointed.Brave has a little originality to its story. We don't see anything very intriguing but the wisps. The rest is something that we've already seen in other animated movies. But the film obviously points out at the message. Pixar finally returns at bringing genuine emotions after the Cars 2 fiasco last year, but this film doesn't go deeper until the third act. The movie is plodded with too much humor in the intro which it delays to the main plot. It's better when it finally goes to the story.Some might still complain about being different to the usual Pixar animation. It is different and indeed feels more like a standard Disney animated film than Pixar. The main reason is the lack of high concepts. This is probably the least interesting concept among the others, but again it is more about the heart. The animation just got better. The visuals are undeniably gorgeous and it's enough for making this worth watching. The cast gave plenty of personality to their roles. The score is wonderful and exciting.Overall, it's a great movie but it's kind of out of place as a Pixar film because it doesn't have any intriguing ideas like toys coming to life, daily life of monsters, a superhero family, a flying house, rats can cook, etc. But the heart is still there and it works effectively. Maybe they wanted to try to be basic and leave the high concepts for a while. For now, we have a heartwarming tale about family. The filmmaking is without a doubt well done. The animation looks great. Pixar never fail at making good movies. Since this is not their best, at least they gave us something sweeter and absolutely beautiful.",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
A More or Less Average Film,"Determined to make her own path in life, Princess Merida defies a custom that brings chaos to her kingdom. Granted one wish, Merida must rely on her bravery and her archery skills to undo a beastly curse.The people who select the Golden Globes winners... something is very, very wrong with them. Somehow this film became the winner of the Golden Globe for animation. Now, maybe the vote was split on two others and this one sneaked through... but I think somehow they thought it was the best. It is anything but.Having now seen the five Oscar nominees for best animated feature, I sincerely hope this film does not walk away with the award. While it has a strong feminist message that may appeal to young women (which is good), the overall plot is your standard Disney story: girl gets in disagreement with parents and rebels, has to learn that she was wrong. We saw this in ""Little Mermaid"", to some degree in ""Beauty and the Beast""... it is nothing new.The animation is well done, that is true. But even if we judge the film only on technical merits, it would have to compete with the other nominees. Add in actual plot and a level of innovation and fun, and this one is nothing -- ""ParaNorman"" and ""Wreck-It Ralph"" are clearly better films, and even ""Pirates"" is probably the greater contribution to cinema.The title and concept are confusing. Being called ""Brave"" and taking place in Scotland made me think it was a Disney version of ""Braveheart"". No. Not even close. The plot says she has to use her bravery and archery... well, sort of. But it is not actually an important aspect of the story.This is a film you can play for your kids if you want the television to babysit them.

Red Haired Princess wins hearts,"Brave – CATCH IT (B+) For the first time Pixar decided to make their main protagonist to be a female character. Brave is not like a typical Pixar movie it's more like Disney' princess story though their princess is not naive as usually Disney's princess are. She is Brave & willing to fight for what she wants.The other thing which makes Brave unusual is that it's about a mother, daughter relationship rather than a love story and this is a rare thing for a princess's movie. As usual the animation and especially the red curly hairs are amazing. Brave maybe little weak in story but is sure entertaining.Overall, I would say Brave is stunningly gorgeous and a must seen.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

"Not among Pixar's finest, but solid family fun regardless","I have always loved Pixar's films, they are charming, funny, full of heart and have identifiable characters, strong stories and gorgeous animation on the whole. I was strongly anticipating Brave as I would do for any animated movie, and while I still enjoyed it very much I was a little disappointed as well. Ranking it with Pixar's other films, I don't consider Brave as good as the Toy Story films, Up, Monsters Inc, Finding Nemo and WALL-E, but I consider it better than the Cars films(which I did like actually) and put it on the same level as Bug's Life(Pixar's most underrated), Ratatouille and The Incredibles.Does Brave have flaws? I personally do think so. The dialogue does get better later on but felt rather cheesy and awkward to start with. The story is still entertaining, polishedly told and is solidly paced but just lacks the heart of previous Pixars and comes across as old-fashioned in places. The kingdom's menfolk are also clichéd, and as much as I hate to say it unfortunately some of the clichés came across as lazy to me.Starting with the best asset of Brave though, the animation is simply amazing. The Scottish countryside is beautifully shaded and very evocative and Merida's hair is very life-like. The colours look gorgeous also, and the characters are well modelled. The music score is beautiful in its Celtic lilt and haunting in the atmosphere it creates in the forest. While not as good to start with, the writing does at least have some pitfalls and gags to amuse children and adults alike with the more dramatic/intense moments unforced and convincing. The main characters are engaging. I was especially taken with Merida, you don't relate with her in the way you do with WALL-E but I liked that instead of her having the predictable romantic fate of the Disney Princesses(no offense intended, I love those movies) and potentially dull as dishwater, she is very headstrong and actually matures throughout the film. The Witch and the mother are also well done characters. The voice acting is great. Kelly MacDonald is very spirited as Merida, and Emma Thompson is a sympathetic mother figure. Julie Walters is appropriately formidable as the Witch, and Robbie Coltrane amuses. Billy Conolly is a somewhat predictable casting choice- when you think Scotland Conolly immediately comes into your head- but his great sense of comic timing and exuberance still delights to not make that matter too much.In conclusion, rock solid family fun but not Pixar at their best. 8/10 Bethany Cox",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

More like straight Disney than Pixar,"The animation/effects were wonderful, the storyline just about lived up to the publicity (Pixar's first female lead - and no male lead at all - hurray!) ... but the humour - sadly lacking. A few flashes from Billy Connolly's character and Merida's mute little brothers, but that was it.We don't expect much in the way of wit/irony from Disney, but we have learned to expect an extra layer from Pixar that just wasn't there. And that's why I left the cinema thinking ""Is that it?"" Age-wise, it would be okay for most kids from about eight upwards - but much of the film is very dark and ranges from quite spooky(with supernatural themes) to straight out scary.Roll on Ice Age 4 and Madagascar 3 ...Oh, and IMDb, I know you're American, but there is really no need to try to get me to correct perfectly good English spelling.

Meh.... I was disappointed,"Perhaps one of the most interesting things about the movie are the articles I've read regarding the details behind how Pixar animated Merida's hair.

Without adding spoilers, the trailer implies it's about a girl standing up for herself in a male competition, but it's only a very small portion of the overall theme. The movie has some genuinely moving moments, but does not live up to the promise of its previews.Not one of the Pixar's best.",6.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
"The ""Pixar magic"" is, much like Tom Cruise's sanity, lacking.","Visually stunning, but substantially lacking, Brave checks in near the bottom of my favorite Pixar movies list, right next to Ratatouille. Sure, the cinematography is beautiful and the effects are top-notch. But this is Pixar. I don't expect anything less. There are simply some parts of the job that you should always do well. Don't fix me a beautifully garnished barbecue platter and then expect a pat on the back when it turns out the plate actually has very little barbecue on it. Brave contains several nice elements, but the ""Pixar magic"" is, much like Tom Cruise's sanity, lacking.A lot of my disappointment hinges on the film's inability to meet my expectations, and that fault rests on the shoulders of the marketing department. Whoever put together the trailer needs a lesson on ""false advertisement."" After I initially saw the trailer for Brave I thought, ""Cool. Looks like Pixar is taking the concept of Braveheart, animating it, creating a female protagonist, and making it fun for the whole family. I'm on board! They'll never take OUR FREEDOM!""Unfortunately, the film takes a weird turn about halfway through and puts its own twist on the ol' ""mother and daughter trying to repair their relationship"" dynamic. Now before you skewer me and throw me on the grill, please keep in mind that I did enjoy the film. I just never could get excited about it. It starts off slowly, delivers a twist I neither expected nor wanted, and fails to deliver the charm we've come to expect from films such as Toy Story, The Incredibles, Cars, etc. It's a prime example of a one-and-doner – once you've seen it, there really isn't much to warrant an encore viewing.And one warning to parents – there are quite a few moments that will be too scary and intense for the wee ones. If there is a chance that storms, witches, darkness, and bears trying to maul children could frighten your child then you might want to think twice before taking them to see this. At least a couple of kids started crying at the screening I attended, and one other asked her mom to let her leave the theater.Anyway, I know good and well that reviewing a Pixar film is about as pointless as carving Jell-O with a Ginsu knife. I could tell you it was the movie equivalent of a shirtless Michael Moore and you'd still go see it. So be it. Thus are the limitations of my influence.",6.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

I will tell you that it's those people that does not pay attention to the real meaning of this movie.""Brave"" does not mean just fighting monsters or risking your life. ""Brave"" mean doing something that require your courage and that is what had showed in Princess Merida. She bravely admit her mistakes and protect her family. You may ask then why they showed her skill in archery ? This is a mean to show the reason for the movie Another beautiful thing about this movie is it about family. I'm sure every single parents with a teenage or may be just a daughter are the ones understand this movie the most. From the beginning to the end of the movie The Queen always protects and cares for her daughter and these action are showed through an amazing plot that i can't describe without spoiling the movie.This is the movie that should be screened and made not stupid movie like ""Step Up"" series - promoting kids to ""break the rule"" - . Kids never understand what the adult did to protect them.

A return to form for those Pixar geniuses,"Disney's ugly stepchild, affectionately known as Pixar, is back. Old reliable, usually, though their last outing was actually quite rubbish. Nobody in their right mind – adults and children alike – could claim Cars 2 was a cinematic success. It wasn't. But that was a mere glitch because, with Brave, they are back to their brilliant best.Brave is the story of Merida (Kelly MacDonald), a rebellious Scottish princess who prefers riding on her horse and using her bow than acting ladylike and princess-y. When the time comes for her to get married and fulfil her duty as princess, Merida decides to take matters into her own hands and consults a witch.Brave's biggest achievement is its attention to detail: this might all be CGI, yes, but Scotland has never looked so beautiful. The animation is as close to perfect as you could possibly get, which makes watching the film that much more enjoyable. What you really come to see, though, is a good story and great characters. Brave has both. Kelly MacDonald, as Merida, is brilliant. She's come a long way from Trainspotting all those years ago, and deservedly so. Here, she also has the benefit of voicing a beautifully-written character. Pixar has a history of creating well-rounded, real characters - just look at Toy Story, Up and Wall-E – and Brave can be added to that list.There's very little to fault about the movie, if I'm honest. When trying to be funny, it's laugh-out-loud funny. The emotion is emotional. It hits all the right notes, and never stops entertaining. I can't even complain about it being too long, because it's not. The thing about Pixar is that they concentrate on every single thing with utmost care and attention. The CGI is stunning, but it's also a brilliant story with excellent characters.It's refreshing to see that an American animation company can create such an authentically Scottish movie.

Better than expected!,"Honestly I wasn't looking forward to this Disney film at first because it really didn't interest me at all. I thought that Disney Princess movies have ran their course, but after watching the film I found out I was wrong. Disney just never seems to disappoint me, even if I didn't have the slightest interest. I only went to go see this film because my friends were like ""Hey let's go see a movie."" Since I have seen the other movie that are already in theaters, we all decided to see Brave at the last second.The film stars Kelly Macdonald (No Country for Old Men, Trainspotting), Billy Connolly (The Last Samurai, The Boondock Saints), and Emma Thompson (Nanny McPhee, In the Name of the Father).The 3D in this film was not as good as I thought it would be for a Disney film. Most animated movies I see have great 3D and sadly this one didn't impress me at all.The film starts of as your average Disney movie does and you meet your princess Merida (Kelly Macdonald) right away. Now something I did like was that this takes place in Scotland so everyone has an awesome accents. Also something that was good is that the film was a lot darker than other Disney films. After trying to be forced to get set up with a suitor to marry her, she runs away from her problems and finds a way to change her fate around. At this point in the film is where the film takes a different and surprising turn where if you don't like it, then you won't like the rest of the movie. I happen to like where it went and enjoyed the whole film.It is definitely not the best Disney movie ever made, but it is a pretty decent film. Truthfully I was expecting to be disappointed from the film and I am glad to say that was very impressed. Especially at the animation, Merida's hair looks so real in the way it moves and looks.

King Fergus and the Clan leaders are a hoot. The film is also a moving postcard for Scotland. I've been to Castle Urquhart on Loch Ness and it is just as beautiful in the film as it is in real life. Hopefully, this film will inspire more Scottish vacations as it is a stunningly beautiful place.Bottom line is that this is a must see family film of the Summer.

The animation was by far the most beautiful to date, and the characters were very lovable. The only problem I have was how some of the scenes, including character bonding moments, seemed sped along. I found that if these scenes had been longer or even more emotional, that I would have begin to connect to characters more. Even so, each set of characters brought a different sort of humor with them, making this a movie that will have you laughing and giggling at every turn.

The Pirates Of Pixar...leashed by Disney!,"""Brave"" is another Pixar creature unleashed upon the world...It still contains the Pixar magic of creativity and originality, in so far as the story and characters, the animation quality and the production values.However recently, under Disney's tutelage, Pixar's vitality has started to fade away and die a slow painful death. While ""Brave"" still maintains some of the legendary Pixar vitality, it is also an example of how Pixar has started to become worn around the edges...The movie still makes for a fun family viewing, with plenty for the adults sprinkled in there to keep the level of laughs quite high.

"Braveheart for kids, doesn't really feel like a pixar movie, more like a Disney flick.","I might as well make it quite clear that i am a huge pixar fan and have lost count of how many times I've seen their movies and shorts... up till Cars 2.Brave is one of those films that has a impact upon the animation genre, the problem is its not a very big one, especially when we remember what Toy Story did for the 3d CGI animated movie genre, Brave is more evolutionary than revolutionary, which isn't a bad thing, just slightly disappointing.The Animation, characters, style and 3d are all fantastic and a massive step up from their last films what its what we have come to expect from pixar and they have mastered the Celtic style and location perfectly, even the lighting and mood is spot on, the problem is the story and what a shame that is because its mostly solid with some slow dragging parts in the middle.Its more like Toy Story 2 compared to TS1/TS3 its good but not great, adults will find little to occupy themselves in the middle in act 2.fortunately Act 1 and 3/4 are great, the problem is with the pacing of the middle part of the movie, a problem pixar faced with cars 2 and to a lesser extent cars 1.Obviously kids will love this movie but even they might have trouble with the middle part of this movie because the pacing drops right off, but it picks up again quick enough.Onto the rest of the movie, there's a lot of great Scottish and Celtic gags which should not rustle too many kilts.The theme is also a great idea mostly executed very nice, although its a bit predictable Pixar have mixed things up enough for it to still be interesting, basically its a coming of age drama with some fun supernatural, highlander and old school slapstick thrown in, its all very well put together and very enjoyable, is the experience deep? In parts yes, but not in the middle (hence why this movie is only getting average scores) If i could compare this movie to something else thats similar i would say its like Tangled crossed with Mulan, which are both fantastic Disney movies.now onto the controversial part the breaking/mixing of gender roles and stereotypes in this movie are not a problem, i am a male and i liked how the characters where portrayed, but it feels too... safe, i guess pixar didn't want a pg-13 rating which is understandable since they make most there money from kids toys and viewers BUT i did feel like they cut a lot out (the directors admitted it too for the interest of time and rating) hopefully the directors cut will give us more adult content.Its not often a pixar movie feels short and rushed, this one did.I give it 8 red heads out of 10 - needed more spark and less fizzlethis is not one of those movies which i could easily re watch again in 3D either.On a whole this is a very solid movie, just don't expect Toy Story 3 or Wall-e and personally i recommend the 2D version as the 3D version isn't worth the extra money and if you struggle with 3d movies 2 hours is a long time.If you feel the same way about brave, don't worry, there are still some excellent animated movies to come out, Wreck it Ralph by Disney's own animation studious also looks fantastic.",6.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

Amazing!,"I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. I saw the trailer when it first came out months ago and I am so glad the movie lived up to expectations. I am a bit biased as I love Scotland and have visited the country many times but the story line was catching and well done. I didn't find the plot was too predictable or slow either. I found all the characters likable and fun and filled with genuine Scottish charm and ruggedness.The movie may be a bit long for younger children, my friend and I were sitting behind a couple with three kids in the theatre and the youngest one kept falling asleep and wanted to go home. I was hooked throughout the whole movie and I will certainly be buying it when it comes out on DVD.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Beautiful movie,"So..I went to see Brave a little confused because there were a lot of people saying it sucked, and a lot of people saying it was excellent. I must say I loved the movie, i know people are disappointed because the trailer showed a girl with an arrow and they were expecting a more epic movie,I was one of them, I was expecting an epic movie. However, I wasn't disappointed with the result, Brave is a beautiful movie,to say the least. The CGI is incredible, and the landscape is gorgeous. I know most people say its great because the princess doesn't end up with a prince, which is a great aspect of the movie, however, I think the most important thing is the fact that they show that you can pursuit your own happiness without depending on somebody else to do it, you can be happy trying to fulfill your own personal dreams, and see where life takes you. Apart from this, which I believe is the main message of the movie, it has some very funny characters and very likable, of course the mother-daughter issue is one we have all probably went through.

A Revelation in Female Heroism as well as Family Values,"At first glance, some may think of ""Brave"" as a step-down from Pixar's usual revelation, but after much consideration, I figured there really wasn't any fault with ""Brave"" itself. Some think ""Brave""'s weakness comes from the risky choice of using the fiery-haired Scottish, female protagonist (a first for Pixar), but the real throwback comes from Pixar's choice to take their story from a fairy tale take on things. Most of the other Pixar films featured original stories, ones that were only vaguely familiar. Throughout ""Brave"" I couldn't help but let my mind wander as the film progressed. Each conflict somehow reminded me of other fairy tales (""Beauty & the Beast"", ""Pinnochio"", etc. ), but that's exactly how fairy tales work. Lessons to be learned are hard to come up with, and the classic recycling of tales works in harmony with this still original story. The authentic accents of Kelly Macdonald as the scarlet-haired archer known as Princess Merida, and Emma Thompson as the caring yet sometimes ""Carrie""-esque mother, Queen Elinor create an atmosphere of ancient and mystifying Scottish countryside (animated beautifully with lush greens and bright blues). The problem isn't in the voice acting. Animation is a perfectionist practice, they carefully plan and make sure the voices are perfect enough to work the animation around. The problem is in the writing. Something like this dialogue, filled with light (and sometimes crude) humor is often over-played (especially in the beginning), but it's sure to keep kids entertained. But that kind of logic (wanting to appeal more to a certain audience, rather than everyone) is what I would've expected from DreamWorks. When the movie needs to be dramatic or serious, it achieves it with grace and controlled emotion, but it sort of jumps right into it, without much tension building. It's more of an explosion and the movie plays out from there. The problem with fairy tales is; they're always predictable. You can't escape the clichés forever though, and I still applaud the filmmakers for handling their first female protagonist with an elegance and intrigue without having to make a big deal about romance or tradition. The mystifying Scottish culture that surrounds the film's atmosphere is eye- catching. The cheesiness of that family-time goodness seeps in blissfully, even for those who find the humor to be draining at times. ""Brave"" isn't the strongest Pixar film, but it's not a failure.",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Pixar's Brave,"""Brave"" is the story a mother and daughter who don't seem to see eye to eye. There is a constant struggle between tradition and choosing ones own path, but both fail to see the middle ground. Merida wants to be free and see the world, but Elinor, her mother, wants her to be a proper princess. The story tells us that we might have our own thoughts and ways of doing things, but we also have to be careful of what might be the outcome. The message is pretty good, but I feel it loses sight in its second act, were they focus on humor more so than telling a compelling story.The film is directed well and there are so many powerful moments. One in particular is the fight between Merida and Elinor and after the fight is over Elinors reaction put a lump in my throat. However, I felt the story wasn't paced very well. The beginning is marvelous and feels like the story is going to be very grand, but the second half bogs everything down. Emotions are left for humor. The humor in the film is hit or miss and more misses than hits. They are childish, but what's worse about is that it pulls you out of some really heart wrenching moments. There isn't a balance between the heart and humor, which is rather disappointing.Characters are fine, my personal favorite is the dad, King Fergus. He's like a big likable bear. Merida is good, but she could have used more polish, aside from archery she doesn't have an identity of her own. Elinor is good too, but in the second act she loses herself much like the film. The relationship between Merida and Elinor is something to marvel at because it is so real and genuine. We feel the love they have for one another, but we also see why they can't stand each other. I really felt this story would delve more into their relationship, but in the second act it feels more like a buddy comedy only towards the end does the film realize that the story is about a mother and daughter.It's Pixar and one thing you can guarantee is that the animation is going to push the envelop and ""Brave"" is no exception. The scenery is grand and lavishing, it feels so alive. The character animations are so good and you'll know what I mean when you watch it, just look at the way Merida moves. Everything is refined and I really felt as if this was a mystical area some where in Scotland.Overall ""Brave"" is a decent flick. The animation is gorgeous and the songs and score are good as well. The beginning of the film is fantastic and really pulls you into the story and hypes you up for where it might go. However, the second act bogs everything down, the humor becomes juvenile, interest in characters are lost, and the story doesn't know what it wants to do. It goes from and endearing story about a mother daughter relationships to a buddy comedy focused and cheap laughs. I really did want to like this film, but it left me disappointed with only frustration when I look back on it now. I give a low 3.5/5, great animation, even better opening, but the rest of the film leaves more to be desired.""Caliente""",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Better is difficult,"This animation movie reaches the top of its kind not only in technical terms (images, movements, scenes, landscapes, special effects, characters' human-like expressions) but also in terms of contents (a good touching story of good values). We almost forget we are watching an animation movie at some moments. The character of Merida the young rebel princess is very well conceived and designed and it's also morally convincing. In visual terms it is sometimes delirious and overwhelming and it's very well proportioned in terms of comedy, drama, action, poetry and angles of vision. An excellent movie not only for children but also for grownups",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
A Great Mother/Daughter film,"Animation: 8/10 The animation is amazing (equal to the quality in UP I would say). The animation really excels when showing the Scottish landscape as well as Merida's hair. The only sad part is that after the opening first act you don't see too many larger scenes of the landscape.Voice Acting: 10/10 This is where the film is absolutely perfect, some people have been complaining they had difficulty watching since everyone in the film have such thick Scottish accents but it brings a lot of originality to the film and helps bring more personality to all the characters. The accents (though Scottish) are similar to How to Train your Dragon, if those accents bothered you the ones in this film probably will as well.Score: 7/10 Fits perfectly with the film. The score was done by Patrick Doyle using bagpipes, single flutes and other Scottish instruments adapting traditional Scottish jigs and Gaelic psalms. The result is a score with an authentic Scottish feel as well as sounding surprisingly modern.Story: 5/10 Unfortunately this is were the film starts to fall apart, the characters are really fantastic, and this film is very much a character story, but the actual plot surrounding those characters is mediocre at best. The first act in the film, which sets up the characters and background, is perfect in every way, and I mean perfect. Unfortunately once the plot gets going into the second and third act the film becomes increasingly average.Still it is a great film centering on a real mother daughter kind of relationship, and the character of Merida herself is a great role model for kids, she is far from the perfect stylized princesses with an adult personality that have traditionally been used. This princess is a real girl imperfect with a genuine childlike and spontaneous personality.Conclusion: 7/10 This is a great film about a mother and daughter both needing to listen to one another, they learn to recognize their own flaws, listen to what the other wants, and see the world through the others point of view. If you're looking for an animated mother/daughter film or a good young female role model then this is the best film out there.side note: A lot of younger kids have found the bear Mordu in the film too scary, google a picture of Mordu before you watch it, he really is surprisingly frightening for a children's film.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Fairylore Pixar Style,"""Brave"" is unlike any film made previously by Pixar. Not only does it feature a female protagonist as hyped prior to release, but it is essentially a fairy tale instead of a science-fiction or funny animal story. Having said that, it doesn't quite fit the typical Disney Princess niche that you may expect. For one thing, it isn't based on a traditional story from Grimm or Andersen, nor does it focus on a romance between two young lovers. It instead is an original story inspired by Scottish legend and focuses upon the type of family relationships that a modern audience can easily relate to. As a result, it does what a good fantasy film does best; underneath all the enchantment and magic, it speaks directly to the heart. Not to mention, the film looks beautiful. ""Brave"" perhaps won't top the list of best Pixar films, but it still ranks as a lovely, involving film.",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Cautiously Recommend,"'BRAVE' - 2012Directed by Brenda Chapman and Mark AndrewsStarring Kelly MacDonald, Emma Thompson and Billy ConnollyPlot Overview: Merida (Kelly Macdonald), the impetuous but courageous daughter of Scottish King Fergus (Billy Connolly) and Queen Elinor (Emma Thompson), is a skilled archer who wants to carve out her own path in life. Her defiance of an age-old tradition angers the Highland lords and leads to chaos in the kingdom. Merida seeks help from an eccentric witch (Julie Walters), who grants her an ill-fated wish. Now, Merida must discover the true meaning of courage and undo a beastly curse before it's too late.As much as I do like this movie, which I do, I will confess that is lacks the 'Pixar Touch' and if it didn't literally have the Pixar title emblazoned across it, I would have second guessed it as a Pixar film. While the building blocks are certainly there, it just feels like a half-baked Disney Princess movie and that is unfortunate. I can recommend this film with confidence, but I am not confident in guaranteeing your enjoyment of it. I would definitely see it but don't blame me if it disappoints you. Go in expecting a Disney Princess movie and not a Pixar movie, and you'll be at least satisfied.From what I can tell is that the general consensus of this film is as follows: first third is good, second third is okay and the final third is poor. I am not at all in agreement with that sentiment. I think that each third of this film are just as good as each other BUT I do think that they are all thirds of three separate movies. With the exception of character and animation style, judging purely based on content. I'd have though that this was three different films in one.I do wish that the ending was a little more bittersweet. I am not a fan of the ending and definitely think the film would have been improved IF they cut the climax by 30 seconds in which a major plot point occurs. Remove that point and I think the film is better as a whole.The theme and setting were both very interesting and creative choices so props for not being boring and bland.​ I like the story as a whole but it just feels more like Disney and not like Pixar. I know Pixar is a subsidiary of Disney but Toy Story is a PIXAR movie, Finding Nemo is a PIXAR movie, Up in a PIXAR movie. This feels like a classic Disney princess tale, which is fine, but not like the Pixar I love. I am sure this will be a turn off for most people which I can understand because it isn't Pixar but if you can look past that, it isn't a bad movie.Kelly MacDonald was the clear standout as Merida. ​Merida was a good Disney princess as a whole and I appreciate her entire goal being achieving independence. That said, I think she lacked a form of sincerity to make her great. Not being a cliché Disney princess was a great idea, but I still think she lacked a certain amount of precision in her character design which would make here more interesting to watch. Nitpicking aside, she was a pretty good character as a whole.Emma Thompson was good as Queen Elinor. I do admire her character arc and admire the sheer simplicity to it. She grows as a bearson and I definitely bought that.​ Mor'du in this movie is such an atrocious villain. We know next to nothing about him. He has nothing(literally) interesting to say. He isn't likable. He is a bland, boring, brash bear barking toward Merida and trying to attack; that is his entire character; truly awful stuff Pixar, truly awful.As for comedic sidekicks, this film has three. The witch, voiced by Julie Walters, was a critical plot point and entertaining in her short run on screen but I would have liked to know a little more about her. Billy Connoly's was good as King Fergus and I did like his character as a whole. The triplets were pretty funny and sourced a good portion of the film's good jokes.The animation for this film does look very nice and it is pleasing to look at. The costume and set design were both good and mirror the stereotypical perception of Scotland. Both the cinematography and editing were good. No real complaints on the technical side of the film.There is definitely humour in the movie but it basically boils down to Triplets, Fergus and Witch. Our lead wasn't that funny. Granted that wasn't her character but would it kill her to crack ONE joke. Be funny ONCE. I know I am nitpicking to the nth degree but still, one joke. Just one?There is definitely emotional payoff in this movie. I won't dispute that. What I will argue however is that there is no where near enough as there should be. This does loop back to my earlier point about a preference for a bitter sweet ending. I think that would pull at our heartstrings more and would have made the film so much better.As a whole, I was satisfied with Brave. It did disappoint me slightly but that is because it wasn't a PIXAR movie. It was entertaining for what it was but I cannot say that it grabbed me like other Pixar films do. Nothing about it, bar the setting, really stand out and it just blends into other Disney princess movies. I cautiously recommend you see the film however. I personally think it is worth a watch but I cannot guarantee you will like it. I'd rate 'Brave' 6 'Wee Rascals' out of 10.",6.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
It's nice to see such a strong positive female protagonist in a Pixar film!,"'BRAVE': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five)'BRAVE' marks many firsts for Pixar; it's the studio's first fairy tale as well as it's first film featuring a female protagonist. Pixar also completely rewrote their animation system in order to give the audience the most state-of-the-art visuals possible and the feature is the first film to use Dolby Atmos sound as well. The movie is a little darker than other Pixar films and tells the tale of a rebellious Scottish princess who accidentally brings a curse upon her family that puts her love for her mother to the ultimate test. The story is a bit like classic fairy tales from yesteryear and not nearly as dumbed down as something like Disney's 'TANGLED'. It doesn't live up to the very best of Pixar or Disney's animated films but it is better than average in my opinion. It's nice to see a slightly more mature and dark fairy tale film from the studios as well.Kelly Macdonald stars as the voice of Princess Merida, daughter of King Fergus (Billy Connolly) and Queen Elinor (Emma Thompson). At a young age Merida was given a bow by her father and has since trained to be an expert archer; to the joy of her father and the distaste of her mother. Her tomboy ways displease the Queen who would very much like her daughter to be a more ladylike Princess and this has caused conflict between the two for many years. When Elinor informs Merida that she's to be betrothed to the firstborn of one of her dad's allied clans Merida runs away and finds a witch (Julie Walters) to grant her one wish. This brings a curse to her family that will truly test the strength and willpower of Merida as well as her love for her mother.The film was written by Mark Andrews, Brenda Chapman, Steve Purcell and Irene Mecchi and directed by Andrews, Chapman and Purcell. It's a little slow in places but for the most part is a well made and entertaining animated film. It looks fantastic and although it wasn't quite as thrilling as it possibly could have been I appreciated that it wasn't packed with simplified childish humor. For the most part I enjoyed the story and by film's end was somewhat touched by the mother/daughter story. It was nice to see such a strong positive female protagonist in a Pixar film for a change and the message was one definitely worth teaching kids. It might be a little too dark and scary (at times) for really young children but for the most part it's a good kids film and another impressive inclusion in Pixar's resume.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDQQKEqGhZQ",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Awe-inspiring Animation,"Brave 2012Pixar's Brave delivers everything you could expect from a family friendly animated film and more. Uncomplicated humour and a relaxing watch; the most uncomplicated of humour being exemplified by scot's flashing their bottoms, a feminine crown-wearing bear and a set of mischievous red headed triplets.Merida provides a princess which has not often been seen amongst the likes of Cinderella, Sleeping Beauty and Pocahontas. In Brave the audience is treated to a young girl who refutes gender stereotypes, enforced by her mother, and competes for her ""own hand"" which, in this case, means her independence. Such takes place in an archery competition in which she beats her suitors in a Robin Hood-esque fashion, making her more of the hero as opposed to the Maid Marion damsel in distress.However, when looking more analytically into the film, as Brave's protagonist refutes these stereotypes and clearly identifies best with her father, King Fergus - the audience are given a visual means of such identification via their bright orange, very Scottish, hair - it begins to create a character that is seemingly in the midst's of an Electra complex which she must overcome (identify with her mother) in order to succeed.Still, conversely, aside from the slightly perhaps worrisome psychosexual references, this film is light hearted fun and thoroughly enjoyable nevertheless. It provides entertainment not only for young audiences but for adults as well. The crow-abusing witch character being particularly amusing, as a woman who makes whimsical wooden carvings, mostly of bears, and also trivialises magic and witch craft. She details how she performed a spell for a prince as well as providing him with an ""especially attractive mahogany cheese board.""The impeccable CGI only adds to the many merits that Brave deserves, an example of such being Merida's hair which is captivating in detail. Her hair, in which the audience is treated to gaze upon almost every curl, each one individually crafted, is as visually stunning as it is important in regards to representing her rebellious character and heritage.It is this type of awe striking CGI that was first seen in Pixar's Monsters Inc. in which technology was introduced that allowed each hair on character Sully's body to move individually. Yet, it is not only the hair which aid in the capture of the imagination, but the way in which the clothes move with the character's bodies the audience could be forgiven for overlooking its brilliance as, in its perfection, it becomes unnoticeable in the way you wouldn't notice synchronisation between clothes and an actor's movements in an unanimated film. In order to make such beautiful computer animation, Pixar rewrote their animation systems for the first time in 25 years and, without a shadow of a doubt, it has paid off.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
"Different and New, But A GREAT Change!! (If this teenager can fall in love with this movie, so can you!)","Brave is completely different and new from other Disney movies, and I have to say I love the change! First of all, it's a whole different ethnicity and setting, which I LOVE to see! It doesn't have a princess falling in love for an average boy or vice versa, but it has a wonderful mother-daughter story line! This focuses more on family, being who you are, and accepting who others are. Disney has never really done anything like this, and I especially love the mother-daughter aspect. Have you ever noticed how in so many Disney movies, it has cheesy romance? Not that I'm complaining, I love cheesy romance, but it's never focused so much on family like Brave. There's never really been any strong mom characters, either, since in Disney movies usually the mom is a moot point- they're always absent from the story line in some way, whether they're dead or just not an important part of the story. But in Brave, Disney manages to do the whole deeper meaning thing with finding one's self, accepting others, and familial love, but also incorporates a strong, caring mother and daughter who find a way to reconnect and understand each other, which is something VERY important in today's society. In today's society, you always hear about teenagers and parents who don't get along, so coming from a teenager, I think it's ABSOLUTELY GREAT that Disney did a movie where the mother and daughter manage to sort their differences and accept one another. It's a welcome change, and it sends a strong message to little kids (and teenagers who, like me, LOVE Disney movies) that is important to receive in the world we live in today.Now, apart from the changes and differences, I have to say I loved pretty much everything about this movie. I especially loved the little brothers- they made my night. I think they're my new Maximus and Pascal. I loved how Merida was able to stop the betrothal and change tradition while still gaining understanding and a special bond with her mom, and that speech she gave to the clans. Though I'm pretty sure I already said this, I love how Merida and her mom came to understand and accept one another. I love Merida's father, especially when he pretends to be Merida for her mom. I love this movie, it made me laugh, and it successfully portrayed a deeper meaning of love and FAMILY that Disney has been missing all these years (I mean, they have touched on it and beat around the bush, but they've never really confronted it head on like this!(: It's great they finally have!).I love the movie, and I will definitely be watching this over and over again. Do I recommend it? YES!",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Highly entertaining,"What if you'd been told your whole life that you were destined for something you didn't want? Worse yet, something you hated with almost every fiber of your being. How far would you go to change it?King Fergus and Queen Elinor (voiced by Billy Connolly and Emma Thompson, respectively) have four children. Their triplet sons Hubert, Harris, and Hamish, and there oldest, a daughter, named Merida (voiced by Kelly Macdonald). Before her brothers were born Merida (Macdonald) bore witness as a bear attacked her family and took her father's leg. Subsequent to the attack, Merida, much to her mother's dismay, has grown into a free spirit who rejects her mother's influence. This doesn't stop her mother from offering tips as to how a princess must behave on a near constant basis, however. And when Merida hears the ancient tale of a prince who broke off from his duty and caused his kingdom's downfall, she rejects it without a thought. So, even with her daughter's objections, the Queen holds a contest for the first-born sons of nearby allied clans. The winner will receive her daughter's hand. As the first- born of her clan, Merida competes and wins, causing a rift that is exacerbated when Merida destroys a tapestry and the Queen retaliates by throwing Merida's bow in the fire. Merida flees to the forest in anger and follows a will o' the wisp to a cabin. The old woman inside first insists that she is a wood carver but changes her tune once Merida offers a family amulet in trade for the witch's services. The witch gives Merida a cake and tells her that it will change her mother, leaving out a few minor details as to the nature of that change and telling her only that the spell becomes permanent after the second sunrise.Kelly Macdonald is tragically underrated as an actress. I first saw her in Two Family House, an independent film released in 2000 and then in the 2005 BBC film The Girl in the Café. She had some recent success thanks to Boardwalk Empire, but nowhere near what she deserves, in my opinion. She does a great job as Merida, and I feel similarly about the job Connolly does voicing King Fergus. Thompson does well, but the role doesn't have anywhere near the same number of lines, for obvious reasons. The story is highly entertaining, as is the music. I will say that the ultimate consequence of the main character's actions leave a little something to be desired. Still, a great time.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

Not entirely successful but it works in most ways.,"Overall, I really liked watching this movie but it certainly was not without its flaws and weaknesses.It was good to see a bit of a different animated movie for a change. I feel that this was a more mature movie, with both its story and humor. The emphasis is really put on its story and themes this time, rather than on its comedy and other distractions. And I feel that the movie did a pretty good job with its whole mother/daughter relationship theme, which felt very real and heartfelt and to me was what the whole movie was all about.Thing I also like about the story is that it's being an original one, in the sense that it isn't based on any fairytale or well known story. It's an entirely original story, that still feels in the vein of for instance a brothers Grimm classic.But having said all of that, the story still feels far from perfect. I for one wasn't too fond of its second half, in which the mother 'changes' and the movie starts to become an almost entirely different one. It besides could had used some more conflicts in it. For instance, there now isn't even being a villain in this movie at all and at times the story feels too straightforward and simplistic, as if the writers were in a hurry to finish it on time and had to leave out a whole bunch of ideas, that could had made this movie a bit of a deeper and more entertaining one as well.The animations are really great. I liked the look of the movie and all of its characters. You could also definitely tell some serious time and effort went into all of it, which was all really worth it.Despite of the movie its weaknesses, I overall still really liked watching it and therefore can also really recommend watching this movie!7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
A Family Fairy Tale Interwoven with Love and Courage,"Taking the ancient society as the background, family conflict is the thread running through. When watching, its creativity may be difficult to make people bright, a lot of new definitions, but with the advance of the plot, the narrative charm of the film will gradually reveal. The film has no ups and downs of the grand narrative, there is no shocking creative setting, a family conflict background, is narrated very naturally.The main character, Merida, lives in the royal family, but longs for a free life, and has a fierce collision with the traditional royal rules that Elinor represents. This family conflict is also an intergenerational conflict that can often be experienced in daily life. And this contradiction is cleverly amplified in the film, through a variety of funny plots to show.In the process of finding herself and resolving contradictions, Merida showed extraordinary courage. Her bravery not only changed her own fate, but also ushered in a new turning point for the whole family and even the entire alliance.",6.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

Great 3D and Fun,"I think that what I liked about going to see this film is that although I had seen the trailers many times, I had no clue what the film was going to be about. Initially I guessed that maybe it was about a young woman finding her true love. Boy was I wrong. All I knew was that the animation was going to be great. I heard an interview about this film and one of the directors stated that the most difficult part for the animation team was getting Merida's hair just right. Her hair looked like mine after I've been swimming and it dries naturally. Needless to say it was pretty nappy, but it worked for this film. I wanted to see this film in 3D because the trailer made it look very inviting. When I got to the theater I sat behind a group of young children to gauge their reaction (just in case my inner child had other plans). The kids were totally engaged and did not make a peep during the entire film. This is always a good sign because before the film started they were jabbering away. The animators made Merida and all the other characters very lifelike. This included the persona of a typical teenager and the very small world that they live in (it's all about them). I love the fact that the film is set in the Scottish Highlands and that every now and then when a character spoke, you couldn't tell what the heck he was saying. (That's okay; the characters in the film couldn't understand him either). I would be remiss if I did not mention the mischievous trio of brothers. They had me cracking up and got into all sorts of stuff. This film definitely touches on the mother and daughter bonding experience and ultimately drives home the fact that you have to do what's in your heart to do. When the film was over all the kids in the theater were applauding. Although I do not think that this is one of Pixar's better works, it was definitely enjoyable and worth seeing in 3D. The only caution that I would point out is there is a very scary looking wolf/bear (whatever) that might frighten very young children. I say gather up your brood and go check it out.

An amazing achievement in animation.,"History went down after I saw the Disney and Pixar animated film Brave. Kelly McDonald did amazing... and same as the rest.

JUST OKAY - (6 stars out of 10),"The stage curtains open ...Though ""Brave"" offers stunning visuals, awesome computer graphics and animation, the story is rather plain and mundane. It is the stuff that little children's fairy tales are made of. A morality tale ... you know, the kind of story that ends with - ""and the moral of the story is...""It is the story of a Scottish mother and her daughter - the Queen and her Princess - proper behavior and etiquette for a girl who would rather be riding her horse out in the wilds of the woods, flinging her arrows into the air, than taking care of matters of court. But when Queen Elinor becomes most insistent that her daughter, Merida, choose a marriage mate from three inept suitors - Merida resorts to having a spell conjured that will change her mother's mind ... leading to disastrous results that she must correct before it is too late.We've all heard this story on one level or another in various different circumstances over the years. It is a 10-minute-tale that is dragged over 93 minutes that relies very heavily on visual content and humorous effects. It is easy to see why it has received such good reviews - and for the younger kids, it is going to please and satisfy. For adults however, it just doesn't have that cutting edge.This isn't necessarily a recommend, and yet it is definitely worth the watch. It has some memorable scenes and a decent soundtrack. It leans heavy on action and fantasy elements but has enough witty dialogue to keep it interesting. I felt ""Brave"" was just okay overall. It isn't a favorite of mine among Pixar films, but not bad either.",6.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
"An ""anti-princess""","Fairy tales are traditional and nobody messes with tradition, right? Price Charming wins the hand of the fair princess and they live happily ever after. But Merida is a tomboy at heart with red unruly hair who loves riding horseback through the woods mastering an archery course. And the princes from the neighboring clans are far from charming. So of course Merida seeks out a spell to change tradition and of course the spell goes all wrong. In the end, the real question isn't will they live happily ever after but who will learn from the experience.I am so glad Disney has created another ""anti-princess"" like Mulan. Not all girls have to love pink and fancy dresses. Some can wield swords or bows and fight for what's right.There are a couple intense scenes that some may be sensitive too.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Love Love Love it. Simply Phenomenal,"KIDS FIRST! Film Critic, Raven Devanney (age 15) shares her review below: video review here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNlM5zTqGHABrave is the all new Disney and Pixar animated film about a young princess who breaks tradition. Determined to change her fate, princess Merida attempts to use a spell to change her mother's opinions on marriage. But, as she soon learns, not everything is as it seems when it comes to magic. Brave is a visual masterpiece. It is honestly the best Disney Pixar film I have ever seen and it took my breath away. Which such beautiful imagery and an unsuspected storyline, I believe that Brave will go down in history as one of the best animations ever. I laughed and cried throughout the whole film, it even moved my parents to tears. The heavier emotions are so wonderfully crafted and the comedy is hilarious and very timely, it makes for a great emotional medley. My favorite character is princess Merida because she is so strong and determined even when she is faced with challenges and I believe that she is a character that every young person can look up tp. She is also determined to right her wrongs and fix her mistakes and that is something everyone should aspire to do. My favorite part of the film is watching the bear queen try to figure out how to get by in the wilderness because her facial expressions are still very human and hilarious. She was continuing to act like she was in a castle even though she was in the middle of the woods and it makes for a very comical situation. The end of the film is the best part for me. It blew me away and topped my every expectation for a movie ending, but you'll just have to see what happens for yourself. There is definitely some scary and intense parts in this film and younger kids may get frightened but I recommend this film for all ages because it's a must see for everyone. On a scale of 1-5 I give Brave 20 stars because it is so phenomenal so grab your family and friends.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Good...,"""Brave"" is an Animation - Adventure movie in which we follow Merida, a young Scottish princess who defies tradition in a quest to change her fate.I enjoyed this movie because it was visually stunning, particularly in its depiction of the Scottish landscapes and the character designs. While Merida's fiery personality was refreshing, and her journey of self-discovery was a nice change from traditional princess stories. The plot contained some predictable moments and leaned on familiar tropes, something that didn't work very well. In conclusion, I have to say that ""Brave"" is a decent animation movie and a fun watch especially for families, but I have to admit that I expected more from such a high-profile production.",6.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Mediocre and strictly by the Disney rule book,"I suffered through the endless parade of BRAVE trailers for months. So many months. I began to feel the movie had already come and gone. And the trailers told me the single most important thing about this movie: Pixar hired a crack team of PhD mathematicians, created 5 new fields of modeling mathematics, and bought 27 BlueGene supercomputers just to render the girl's hair.The hair bounces. The hair swings. The hair toussles. The hair drops stray locks here and there. The hair compacts. The hair billows. The hair responds to the wind. The hair responds to momentum and interia. The hair responds to humidity. The hair reflects every known shade or ""firey lass"" red along with previously unknown shades the computers postulated and shades the human mind cannot grasp.And the hair is wrapped around a familiar, mediocre, largely predictable story that you've seen several times before in several other ""girls can do anything boys can do"" movies and TV sitcom episodes.Don't let Pixar's technical expertise and visual humor distract you from the cold hard truth that the underlying story is pretty pale. The visual styling is dazzling and inspiring, the attention to detail is mind-boggling. Pixar makes unprecedented use of technology to create a previously unseen richness of environment.Which may explain why they had no energy left to craft a story you'd want to sit through.You've seen each fundamental step of the story anywhere from a million to infinity-minus-one times before. Puberty-straddling girl wants to be a free spirit. Girl complains that NO ONE UNDERSTANDS HER. Girl uses various tricks and ruses to try to demonstrate she's capable but only demonstrates that she's impatient and devious. Girl resorts to a dirty trick to manipulate parents who JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND HER. The dirty trick back-fires and girl spends most of the rest of the movie trying to undo the harm she caused and mistakenly comes to the conclusion that cleaning up her mess proves she's as cool as she thought she was, and isn't a stubborn, willful, spiteful, selfish, manipulative, deceitful, self-absorbed little bitch, not even a little.Remind you of an episode of ""That's So Raven""?

superior animation,"I thought this was an entertaining animated film. First, the animation is great. Merida's hair is amazing. It looks like you could reach your hand out and touch it. All of it was good.The story was pretty good too. Merida loves archery and riding her horse. Then it is announced she must marry the son of one of her father's allies. She doesn't want to do this, so visits a witch and casts a spell on her mom. What she doesn't know is the spell turns her mom into a bear. Then she must make amends and overturn the curse. Once again the animation of both bears was great. And I thought it had a decent ending.FINAL VERDICT: This had some cute laughs and great visuals.

It's Another Pixar Epic (Video Review),"Here is a clip review of the most recent Pixar piece: Brave. Since this is a video review I just want to give a few points on how I will take on this movie. The concepts I bring up are pretty basic, but seem to be overlooked when it comes to Pixar movies. Including...Great Pixar variance that I see getting underrated. I make a claim about Brave's place, in terms of looks. Show a general idea of how it should be looked at. I be sure to think of these movies objectively. Goes along with the idea that these movies are literally written for everyone. No target audience... Though breaking the stereotype of that, with animations, may never happen. It may be looked under a bad light. See why:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDQQV5rH4BE",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
"Brave has a very great aesthetic quality and a round narrative, hitting the lesson and morals, but forgetting a little about humor","Since Pixar began its partnership with Disney, the studio has specialized in animating what was once considered inanimate. She never ventured into a narrative territory already explored to exhaustion by Mickey's House: the world of princesses. This was the case until the arrival of filmmaker Brenda Chapman (from the great ""The Prince of Egypt"") to the company that, together with her fellow director Mark Andrews, gave life to the brave young Scottish Merida, protagonist of this ""Brave"". Despite Chapman leaving the project before its completion due to infamous ""creative differences"", Andrews continued with the project he had conceived with her, pioneering a ""new"" theme for the studio and giving Pixar its first period feature. And, to top it off, his first production starring a female character.The film tells the story of Merida, daughter of King Fergus and Queen Elinor, who is about to come of age and, therefore, in order to follow the customs of the time, she will have her hand disputed by the princes of other families. Merida does not hesitate to show discontent with the customs of her people and ends up causing tension between the families. After meeting a witch and making a request that ends up causing more problems than solutions, Merida must race against time in order to avoid conflicts between the realms and save her mother's life.The first aspect to be raised from the film is that Merida is Pixar's first princess. Many will say that this is a direct Disney influence, but the character in this movie has a very different personality from those classic characters like Sleeping Beauty or Snow White. The red-haired princess is a warrior, cunning, rebellious and independent. On the other hand, she is a much firmer and more contextualized representation of a woman who has her own values and defends them, as opposed to a princess who is just waiting to be rescued by a prince charming.Merida is a young woman with contemporary thoughts and values, that's why at every moment she directly clashes with her mother's conservative values. From the first frame, Merida is seen as possessing a strong personality, although still immature, proving impossible to be contained, as the tears that end up marking her formal costume attest. She faces the disastrous consequences of her actions head-on, never being a girl who waits for a savior. The characters are charismatic, have depth, have human desires and yearnings. Together they illustrate a beautiful story that explores the meanings of freedom (and the way we seek it in our lives) and family.At the same time, it is also not forgotten that this is a teenager, having an inherent fragility of the character that only accentuates her nascent courage. All these factors work to reinforce Merida's character and maturity, even if she is not the only character to grow and reach the end of the projection changed by the events that took place, something that ends up being hammered in the viewer's head in an unsubtle way , a probable side effect of a very tweaked and written script with eight hands.Unlike other films that deal with relationships between friends, Brave is a film about family, and all its problems, especially in the relationship of parents and children, in the case of the film, Merida with her mother, Queen Elinor. It's not possible to talk about the movie without spoiling the plot's many surprises. But it's amazing to see how age doesn't matter, we've all had parental issues and the movie is about just that. And on top of that relationship the movie becomes and becomes something bigger than just an archery adventure as the trailers showed.In Brave, there is no romantic interest or antagonist in the story for the girl to fight. The closest thing the tape has to a ""villain"" is a bumbling witch, whose harmful actions are not driven by malice or greed, but by distraction. Even the ""demon bear"" Mordu, who wounds the King at the beginning of the tape and returns later, is more like an uncontrollable force of nature, never an evil element. Such characteristics, so typical of Japanese filmmaker Hayao Miyazaki's animations, end up dispelling any comparisons that could be made with ""The Little Mermaid"". There is a similarity between the two films, which is the difficulty of communication between the princess and one of her parents that triggers the disaster that gives rise to the plot. In Merida's case, we have the difficult relationship between her and her mother, highlighted through a beautiful scene in which the two rehearse what to say what they feel to each other, but never manage to engage in such a dialogue, not to mention the disastrous clash between they, which ends up generating a tense break between mother and daughter.The animal sidekick, something common in this genre, is present here too, but in a different way, very imaginative and exciting. We still have a good - and economical - use of the inevitable comic reliefs (in this case, the sons of Scottish lords and Merida's brothers), with these never appearing intrusively in the main plot. Patrick Doyle's soundtrack helps to evoke the mood of the story perfectly, although he uses songs to unnecessarily explain Merida's feelings in two moments of the projection.Despite Pixar's typical care and perfectionism in reproducing Scottish sets during production, especially in the castle, there is not a wide variety of environments throughout the tape, trying to disguise this problem with variations in photography, but it is all about a slip that impoverishes the art direction a little. Still, considering the fantastic production and character design (Merida's curls, as wild as she is, are a show in themselves), there's not much to complain about on the visual side. Some shots developed by Chapman and Andrews are breathtaking, such as Merida's intervention in the challenge of her suitors and her confrontation with the bear Mordu.Another strong point is the presence of nature, portrayed in a magnificent way with an impressive wealth of details: everything enchants, from the forest, the waterfalls, and the animals, with special emphasis on the portrayal of bears, beings that are important for In the film's plot, the bears have a wealth of detail so impressive that sometimes they don't even look like they were made by computer graphics. Brave is perhaps the greatest example of Pixar's computational care and polish, the pinnacle of the pixel manipulation technique. It turns out that the graphic quality doesn't stop there. Notice the textures of the shiny fabrics used in the dresses of Merida and her mother Elinor (Emma Thompson). Note the details of the patterns on the more brutish cloths of the kilts. Perceive the coat of the princess' horse mane, the nuances of scenes set at night or at dusk, the movement of each blade of grass, the texture of each rock.One of Pixar's strengths, the script of its stories, is basically Brave's main slip. It is, of course, a very beautiful film, with an enchanting look and a frightening perfectionism. But they are of little use in the face of a plot that takes time to get involved, and when it happens, it tastes like reheating. Here we have a young girl who refuses to face her responsibilities as a lady of the court - such as accepting a suitor chosen by her parents - and, in disgust, ends up making a deal with a witch. It is obvious that the hit will go wrong, and the one who will suffer will be the queen, her mother, who ends up being transformed into a giant bear. At this point, there is a race against time to undo the magic and regain the respect and affection of the father and the entire kingdom. Nothing that has not been seen before, under the most diverse molds. The surprise or twist in the story, despite making use of magic, is not magic. It's almost commonplace and, in a way, already done almost identically in Brother Bear, ironically from Disney. In fact, in this other drawing, the magical event is much more organic in relation to the story than what we have in Brave. So, what we see, starting in the second half of the film, is the forgetting of all the brilliant preparation that came before for the work to become something more standardized, of that style that we have already seen a few dozen times. The technical diligence continues, of course, but the script takes a noticeable drop, losing out on humor, acumen and character development.In any case, Brave, despite being, after all, a minor Pixar work or - using the inevitable comparison - a great movie if it were Disney or DreamWorks, deserves applause. In addition to the quality of computer graphics, Brave leaves us something else: a different princess, with a great personality, whose existence is not justified by the counterpart of a prince. Merida is Merida alone, in its own right. Brave has a very great aesthetic quality and a round narrative, hitting the lesson and morals, but forgetting a little about humor. Not that it's not possible to have fun, but this is not the time when Pixar has surpassed other successes (such as Wall-E, for example), but it is a respectable work to open the eyes of the most skeptical about the future of the company.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

"Complex, thought-provoking masterpiece","I've watched every Pixar movie and have loved their messages, but Pixar has really outdone itself this time with this brilliantly complex movie. Its message - only by being different can you change your life - really touched me. But beyond that, it's up to interpretation, unlike the rest of the straightforward Pixar movies, and it forces you to think about who you really are. You're forced to question authority and rebellion, free will and destiny, heroism and cowardice. I've seen it so many times and gotten a different read about humanity each time.I love the character of Princess Merida - perhaps the most-developed character Pixar has put out since Woody. She's a great role model, not afraid to stand up for herself and defy custom in such a traditional era. In just 93 minutes, Pixar develops a complex, admirable character full of spunk, spirit, and intelligence. She has to be my favorite movie character of all time.Brave is full of adventure and comedy, sure, but it's more than just a children's movie. It speaks to me and provokes thoughts that even classic books cannot, and for that it takes its place as my favorite movie of all time.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

"Brave is an enjoyable animated movie that still manages to have some touching moments, but in the end never reaches the depths of Pixar's exceptional potential",Last year Pixar proved that it was not invincible with the release of Cars 2. This year Pixar is making another less risky film that delves into the world of fairy tales that they have generally stayed away from. The movie features Pixar's first lead lady both on the screen and behind with the scenes with the character of Merinda and co-director Brenda Chapman. While the premise of setting a fairy tale in the Scottish kingdoms is certainly an intriguing one; is it different enough the separate this film from Disney's other princess tales(particularly a stylistically similar Tangled)?

A Beautiful Work from Pixar,"Brave is a new Animated Feature from Pixar and probably this years the best. This is a story of rebel princess trying to changer her fate, to somehow escape from ill-fated life of future queen. So she rides to the very deep in forest and meets a witch asking to changer her mom. The witch makes princess wish come true but in the way that Merida could not imagine and would never wish. That's why she struggles to save beloved mother from the consequences of her own desires.Brave is different from Pixar normal animations and Princess Merida is opposite of all well-known princesses in fairy tail history. She fights, she is funny (most princesses are boring and sad) and not that sweet as the rests. So the story is absolutely original and fascinating.Last year, I thought Cars 2 was the edge of Pixar's creative works. Now I am sorry for that. Brave is visually stunning, beautifully pictured, spectacularly designed and well told story. I loved the landmarks of Scottish nature and I find the idea of ""Scottish Story"" just amazing.On the other hand, screen writing was perfect for animation with lots of dark and light jokes, funny moments and a little bit touching plot. Composers have done outstanding job by making original themes from Scottish national tunes because it helps to tell a story a lot.All in all Pixar has overwhelmed itself this year. They've made a showy, interesting and a very tasty animation about the persons who live inside every of us. But most of people out there are not that Brave to make themselves oppose the general order, their families and friends who don't understand them.

"Not Pixar at its best but still intelligent, engaging and entertaining","I'm not sure why I let Brave pass me by for as long as I have. Perhaps it was the general impression that Pixar is falling off its game since the merge with Disney or just that the mother/daughter theme probably wouldn't appeal to me. Whatever the reason I watched it recently and, while not the bet that Pixar have offered, it is certainly no ""Cars"" either. The plot sees a Scottish princess frustrated that her fate is one of marriage and goes against her mother's wishes to be more the self she wants to be. At this point the film employs a rather unusual plot device to force mother and daughter together and force them both to come together and accept one another. The device didn't really work for me but it was nicely done so I went with it.Although from here there is a lot of device-related action, it never loses sight of the central theme of the mother and daughter, in particular the daughter finding her own path but doing so with the mother rather than despite her. This is mostly nicely done and I was surprised by how some of it was quite moving. Again it doesn't bring the emotional punch that Up, Wall-E and others did, but it still works as more than what it appears to be on the face of it. The comedy is also refreshingly free of pop-culture references as well, which I do enjoy a bit of but sometimes it is nice to just get an entertaining and well told story without all the knowing nods and winks.The voice cast is pretty unimaginative in terms of casting since it seems that someone wrote a list of people with Scottish accents and then worked down that. That said, they are all good so this isn't a problem. Macdonald leads the cast really well and makes for a very positive wee character. Connolly, Coltrane, Ferguson, Thompson and others are all good in support and generally make the most of the material.Brave may not be up to the level of Pixar at its best but this isn't Cars or anything like that. It has intelligent content and heart, even if the narrative device didn't totally convince me.",,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
A Pixar Delight!,"The latest film from Pixar, Brave is another winning film to add to the books. Sure, it's not as good as Pixar classics such as the Toy Story trilogy or Wall-E, but it's still a beautifully-animated, well-written story. It's not that original, but it's a good step for Pixar choosing a strong female character as their central character. I liked the Celtic twist to this story because it made the film a bit more surreal and I love anything that has to do with Scotland.Brenda Chapman's film is about a girl named Merida who is the princess of her kingdom. Much to the dismay of her mother, she doesn't want to live the life as a princess. Merida sets out on an adventure to change the ways of her mother, but she unleashes much more than that.This film has a pretty good voice-cast. There's really no stars here, but there are quite a few recognizable names such as Kelly MacDonald, Billy Connolly, Robbie Coltrane, and Emma Thompson. They all do pretty good voicework since they are mostly English, not Scottish.Overall, this is a winning film of Pixar's in my book. Led by impressive visuals, a good story, moral themes, and a strong central female character, this is a delightful films for all ages to enjoy. It may be a little dark or action-packed for little kids though. But, any film that changes one's mother to a bear is a good film I believe.

But it turns out not. That is the good point about the movie.Now here are what went wrong. 1. Right out out the theater, I was arguing with my 9 year old daughter that the movie should not be named Brave. The reason is because I did not see act of bravery that is worthy for the movie to be named Brave. Not in Merinda, and not in anybody else. I believe a more appropriate name would be Bear, because the movie is all about bear, right from the beginning toward the end.2. The archery skill of Merinda is completely useless. What is the point of showing her with superior archery skill when all she does with the skill is a few unnoticed random shots at a bear. I thought I would see some epic arrow shooting like the one in War of Arrows, but it was a complete disappointment. With or without the archery skill, it makes no difference to the character, neither does it make her look anything braver.3.

Ecstatic film with a touch of love,"Though a casual movie watcher can foretell the gist of the story as the movie progresses, and though we can see some resemblances within the incidents in the story with some movies or stories that are existing today or that we have heard elsewhere, what I would more like to tell is that even though such above cases appears so the movie itself stands in a quiet mesmerizing arena.The geographical representation of the platform where the movie comes to light is so picturesque and brilliantly composed. Characters are brought to life with a touch of complacency. Music composition is so elegant and suits to the theme of the movie very much. Even though those factors are the ones which the creators of the movie usually take care not to go wrong, however they all are intricately painted in a well sophisticated fashion.This movie is so emotionally entailed since due to the vivid representation how a young willful princess who tries to heal her mother from a curse that she unlooked-for. Though a usual movie watcher can see that as a déjà vu, if we watch this movie from the mind of a young child we can see how cohesive the movie is. For me this movie is overwhelming and remarkable, and also brought a tear to my eye. Being this movie an animation the creators have succeeded in representing a typical intimate bond between a mother and a child in an epical way with a touch of love, affection and caring. Even though I have seen or heard such similar stories resembling to the storyline of Brave it does not necessarily mean to me that it should be the end of such sort of stories depicting the maternal bond of a mother and a child. As a matter of fact there should be more movies as this one.This movie is more suitable for children. But I hope adults too can find it adsorbing if they can be in a mind of a child for nearly one and a half hours throughout the movie. By staying so I hope you can get your version of ""Brave"" as you can see. But for me this is my version of ""Brave"".",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Watchable but not memorable.,"It must be difficult being a Pixar flick; anything short of brilliant and you've failed to meet the expected standard. Brave is possibly their boldest attempt in some time, yet is also their least satisfying. Not only dark in themes – pondering the human cost of stubbornness, pride and unwavering vengeance – this Highlander tale is visually gloomy too, largely set in a murky forest and a dimly lit castle. The intensely dramatic tone (the climactic showdown between bears is absolutely vicious) and shadowy cinematography seldom lets up, but when it does there's plenty to enjoy. Not least Billy Connolly's affable buffoon King Fergus (surely a distant relative of Gerard Butler's Viking leader Stoik in How to Train Your Dragon), whose harmless oafishness is a delight to watch. The animation is naturally perfect, the 3D is utilised with care and a handful of gags certainly hit the spot, but this is one of those rare Pixar commodities: watchable, but not memorable.",6.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Just what you expect from Pixar: fun and soulful material,"I'm pretty sure you have seen already the first teaser trailer for Pixar's 2013 project MONSTERS UNIVERSITY. Pixar knows everyone will get to see many times stuff about their movies long before the actual release; I'm not sure how many times I got to see the BRAVE trailer but it even was present in the DVD of CARS 2. So thanks to the trailers and the many newspaper articles I got to see I thought I knew what BRAVE was all about. And the thing is Mark Andrews, Brenda Chapman and Steve Purcell (all doing their very first Pixar feature film) gave me just what I expected: the hugely enjoyable -and visually fantastic- tale of a not very common princess, whose interests go way beyond the traditions of the kingdom (she basically needs to become a -lovely- *princess* and getting an arranged marriage is a big step for that). But actually that ""I got what I expected"" thing goes only for the first part of the film. I really appreciate and love when a film totally surprises me (in a good way, certainly), and BRAVE did exactly that since Pixar didn't give almost anything away with the trailers. What we have is a movement that makes the film more marvelous and that, I dare to say, will alone turn some people off. But it's pure comedy gold - humor based on the classic behavior of a mother. The core of the film's themes is parenting, and you can relate to a lot of things. For instance the stuff with the father (the king, who is one of those that will ""fight a bear with bare hands"" – I recalled the men from HOW TO TRAIN YOUR DRAGON thanks to the king and his pals) being totally rude and everything with his friends until his wife says *no more*! Who can't relate with that? BRAVE is exactly what you expect from Pixar: fun, soulful material, with memorable characters (like the hilarious almost-ignored-by-everybody redheaded triplets!).

Merida WILL inspire. Brave WILL entertain. But the tale WILL NOT WOW.,"The experience of Snow White and the Huntsman left a bad taste and loads of cringe-worthy memories which I was quite eager to leave behind in my latest viewing of Brave. And as expected...Snow White who?? Merida all the way! If both characters were to be compared it would make a case of proton meets electron. Brushing character comparisons aside, THE FILM is your typical visual treat for the kids with nice underlying morals (but overdoing it a li'l wee bit). This animated tale of the feisty archer will definitely make for a good weekend trip to the cinema theater, but sadly only once. The film stumbles slightly in maintaining the tempo of the story. There are moments where kids might momentarily doze off or you might want to shove in a couple of loo breaks in between. Pixar has always maintained great standards in making such movies, whether it be animation or story-wise. So I might just warn that if you are looking for another Pixar movie which might blow your socks off, better hold back your expectations and you might just love it!",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Delightful,"Brave was so much more than a young kid's movie. Some have compared Brave to How to Tame Your Dragon but Merida had a free spirit that stayed with the movie through the end. You just knew there would be no way she'd end up with any of her bumbling comical suitors. Instead, in spite of her rebellious behavior, she reconciled her feelings for her mother and both of them learned from each other. Merida was a true liberated girl, smart and skilled in the art of archery, proving her inner strength and character.I know this may be a stretch but I couldn't help but be reminded of the chapter (I think it was 13) in Don Quixote when Marcella confronts a group of men about to lay to rest the dead young man of the village, Chrysostom, who has died (supposedly of a broken heart) for love of Marcella. But, Marcella was her own person, like Merida, and would not be conquered by the vanity of a lovesick suitor.Musings, that's about it. And I loved the music by Patrick Doyle.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Not Pixar's Best!,"Could've done better is what I can say about this magical journey. Brave could've been made better if the metamorphosis to the bear was not shown. Yet I enjoyed the triplet brothers' innocence, the king's innocuous non- kingliness and the bear's stupidity.Well, the story is pretty clean except that of the magical wand. It is little hard to digest the thing about the fate; the way it is depicted conversely with the notion. Well, in an unorthodox speak, Brave seems to have adopted paradigm shift towards the end. 6 out of 10 it is.Bottom line: Every Pixar fan must watch it! It is a tribute to Steve Jobs, BTW!For more: tejas.you@gmail.com",6.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Another fine movie by Pixar,"Pixar's thirteenth movie and the first one with a female protagonist. And naturally there have been loud and prolonged arguments about the pros and cons of this said character, Merida (Kelly Macdonald). Whether she is a much needed breath of fresh air, a female that can stand on her own feet, or whether she's just as clichéd as the rest of the so-called strong independent woman wannabes and a whiny kid unable to accept responsibility to boot.I thought she worked marvelously. She is independent and very headstrong, but she doesn't fall to the usual clichés at all or if she does, she reinvents them and makes them feel unique to her. One of the great things about her is that she doesn't try to rebel against her gender, like so many lesser versions of her archetype. She is a tomboy, sure, but her rebellion is only against the role of her gender in her society. She doesn't wish to be a man in a man's world. She just wants to live her life as she wants, while still being a woman. A very small, but important difference and one that made her feel real.Furthermore, the characters overall are the real strength of this film, as is usual for Pixar. Not every one of them work as intended, though. I, for one, thought that Merida's younger brothers, the triplets, were an unnecessary distraction. They were the constant source of comic relief, and admittedly they made me chuckle a few times, but they were a tad overused. But fortunately the rest of the characters more than made up for them, being memorable, diverse, funny and identifiable. Special mention goes to Merida's dad, King Fergus (Billy Connolly), who's easily the most likable character in the movie and the source of best jokes.The film also looks great. The whole animation system of Pixar was rewritten for the first time in 25 years and it shows. The improvement is not mind-blowing, but it's noticeable. The small details, the smoothness of movement, the landscapes, they all look great and I couldn't have been happier. The score is also very decent and the voice acting is one of the strongest aspects of the film. How can you not love these Scottish accents. Unfortunately I had to see the film in 3D, and it didn't add anything. Complete waste of my money, that.On the downside, the story isn't all that great. It's not bad, really, but it doesn't reach that bar that Pixat has previously set for its films. The plot has some new and interesting things in it, and I liked how the invert some of the usual clichés completely, but then they proceed to play some of the worst ones completely straight, which just makes me seethe in disappointment. And it's not like a film cannot use clichés in order to be good, far from it, but it shouldn't be too predictable, and that's what this movie is. The moment a new plot point was introduced, I could tell how it'd play out. And I was correct most of the time. The ending had a nice twist, but that's about it.Story-wise this movie felt more like a Disney production, and not in a good way. It had song sequences, it had fairy tale elements, it had the children against parents kind of thing going on, it had a moral lesson to be learned... It just didn't feel like Pixar.That being said, it's still a good film. It's not great, like so many other Pixar films, but that doesn't prevent it from being very, very good. It has great humour, it has great characters, it has great animation, it's just the story that's a bit subpar.",5.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Pixar's Recovery Begins On A Brave Note.,"Winner of Academy Award for Best Animated Film, Pixar's Brave is their only Oscar-winning feature to date that doesn't feel worthy of such honour for it travels a much safer & risk-free route unlike any of their previous works plus features a narrative that bears more similarity to Disney films than Pixar's unconventional method of storytelling.Set in the Scottish Highlands, Brave tells the story of Merida; a skilled archer & princess who defies an old-age custom of her kingdom by choosing to not be betrothed. Wanting to take control of her own life rather than let it be decided by others, she stumbles upon a witch & asks for a spell to fulfil her wish, which goes horribly wrong.Directed by Mark Andrews & Brenda Chapman, Brave is what you get when you marry Disney's own fairy-tale elements with Pixar's unprecedented animation. While there's much to criticise just because it isn't the way Pixar generally do these things but there are also plenty of things to admire about, including the character of Merida who is no typical Disney princess.While the story doesn't hold enough strength, Pixar's animation is still as jaw-dropping as it has always been. The images are breathtaking to look at, thanks to the incredible amount of detail present in its photo-realistic images as well as its expert use of colours & lighting, pacing is excellent in the first half, and its wonderful depiction of Scottish heritage is a welcome treat.Patrick Doyle's score is mesmerising, beautiful & intimate, and stitches itself beautifully with the depicted era of kilts & bagpipes. Its homage to earlier Disney classics & Studio Ghibli is nicely done. The characters are funny, colourful & really benefit from its near-perfect voice cast who truly nail the required Scottish accent, while Merida herself steps us as the brave, fearless & strong-willed princess we aren't usually accustomed to.Yet, there's no denying that I expected much more from this film because the trailers sort of promised it as a celebration of a young woman's independence instead of what it actually turned out to be i.e. a story about mother-daughter bonding. I still had a wonderful time with Brave, was thoroughly entertained by it if not blown away for it offers plenty of laughs throughout its runtime, has a playful tone & is gorgeously rendered.On an overall scale, Pixar's first-foray into the fairy-tale sub-genre may not be the rebound this pioneering animation studio needed after its first taste of failure with Cars 2 in the preceding year but Brave still falls in the right direction in Pixar's road to recovery. Fun, adventurous, enjoyable, entertaining & satisfying, Brave is no groundbreaking cinema but its vivid portrayal of fate & family is still something that I absolutely & unexpectedly adored.",,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Delightful but not very memorable,"When you hear Pixar you think of the films that will likely be considered classics if they aren't so already. Here we are given a film slightly outside of Pixar's usual area of expertise, and though it wasn't necessarily graceful in its undertaking, it certainly tried.There were a lot of aspects to the film that deserve recognition. The environments were beautiful, the comedy hardly felt forced, and there were--as per Pixar style--a few good moments throughout the film. Unfortunately, it's not enough to give it standing next to its kin. We are given Merida, a stubborn princess who loves archery and desires nothing more than to change her fate. And sadly she is the biggest flaw. Merida is not a person. She is simply a girl who plays a role. This role is of a feisty woman who gives everything she has to defy the bounds placed on her. That's all she is. She has little to no actual desires, other than to defy. She wants what she wants, and ultimately gets it. Sure, she admits her mistakes and apologizes, but when it comes to compromise, she's all take and no give. She has no likability--she's tough, defiant, and these are all good traits, but you can't make a character come alive by these general traits alone. You don't hate her, but you can't really bring yourself to like her either. As for the other minor characters, though they are minor, they do bring some charm. The mother, who plays a more important role, is by far more developed and engaging.The saddest thing about this film, for me, is that it wasn't what I wanted. I didn't leave the theatre disappointed, per se, but I wanted more: especially from a company with a track record like Pixar's. I wanted a serious film with a good story and a cast of characters that were fleshed out. I wanted a film that took its audience seriously and brought us a beautiful fantasy, topped with relatable plights and a well-developed heroine. The film gave us a bit of this, but not to the level that I hoped, expected, and desired.It wasn't a let down. But I hope to see--at least after the god awful premise that is Monster's University is out of the way--that PIxar might head towards a trend similar to that of Ghibli or earlier Don Bluth. Pixar might be owned by Disney, but I don't want to see them ""Disneyfied"".All in all though, this film is at least worth watching. It's funny, charming, and despite its flaws had a lot of effort and love put into it.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
An Amazing movie. Must watch family movie.,"Brave has truly brought forth the best in both animation as well as in storyline. The animation and rendering are truly amazing works and the scenic vistas of Scotland have been beautifully portrayed.The reason that Brave has become so successful is simply because its characters and storyline are very relatable. The character of Merida is essentially that of every modern teenager both boys and girls, who wish to be free and follow their own paths. On the other hand the queen portrays the parents who wish what is best for their children and yet can be overbearing and restrictive.The story represents the struggle that every parent and every child must face. The idea of duty and responsibility, of love and life, of family and brotherhood, has been beautifully conveyed through a magical and adventurous storyline.Overall a 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Not bad but not great either for a Pixar movie,"By just the trailer alone it seemed like a predictable movie about a tomboyish princess that wants to do warrior stuff. Like shooting arrows and fighting with swords and will play a key role in defeating a villain that pose a threat to the kingdom...well it goes in a bit of a different direction. More of a family moral message kinda deal but it just didn't seem all that effective or entertaining for that matter. As a CGI animated movie it's alright but for a Pixar movie, maybe it's because of the expectation. But this was kinda disappointing to the point it's sorta forgettable movie and can bore younger audiences and might no appeal to them much. Since the message for this flick seems a bit forced at times, while lacking the sentimental entertainment value. Not much about this movie stands out and it really is a forgettable movie. Not bad, but for a Pixar movie it isn't great either.6/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Disney/ Pixar does it again.,"I really was excited to see this film. Just saw it today and wow what a treat! The folks at Disney/Pixar always seem to top themselves every time they do another story and this one is excellent.This movie had my heart racing several times and also I cried, yes I admit I'm a softy. I also however thought that at times while the movie was great that it had some stories intertwined in it. Brother Bear and Beauty and the Beast I was thinking because Medora's mother gets changed into a bear although this time it was a whole different reason and also the spell being broken at the end by the words ""I love you"" from Beauty and the Beast.The only thing I would say that was bad about the movie was the dirtiness of it. We see butts and even get a sexual suggestion right at the beginning of the movie. It is also very intense for a younger viewer and I would not suggest it for kids under 12. However my rating still remains the same.An instant Disney/Pixar classic.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Fab!,"Brilliant film. Very touching and shows you how strong a mother and daughters bond can be. Beautiful animation and a fantastic story. Would recommend this for the whole family. It also had a great amount of humour in it! Only two things I felt were faults (one is me just being picky). The little blue lights, think they were called Whispers or something like that , they weren't very well explained. I didn't really know who they were. I think there were a few things that needed developing a bit more. Would have been nice to see the girl get married in the end too. Other than those few little development issues it was great. Soundtrack was wonderful. Loved the Mumford and Sons song at the end but would have loved it to be sung mainly by Mumford and Sons. I looked on YouTube because I couldn't remember the song and found it wasn't a song from their album but it sounds incredibly similar, almost identical, to one of their songs. But very glad they got to do a bit of soundtrack in there.",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

Good Disney fairy tale. Not up to Pixar standards.,"If you go into this move expecting a Disney movie, you shouldn't be disappointed. If you expect a Pixar film, you will be left wanting.Though Brave is a competent fairy tale in the Disney tradition, it lacks the creativity and nuance I expect of Pixar films. I felt like I was watching Cinderella Meets Beauty and the Beast in CGI rather than the next story from the people who brought us Up, The Incredibles, Finding Nemo, and Toy Story.This is the first Pixar film I've seen which I feel is not worthy of a major Academy Award nomination.I hope this is not indicative of Disney's influence on their new subsidiary.

"Disney, you are killing Pixar","Putting aside the magnificent scenes and brilliant music, one cannot realize this is a Pixar film. As a loyal fan who has watched all products of the studio since its very beginning (including all shorts), I couldn't believe this is a movie from my beloved filmmakers.To put it fair, this is still a nice piece (at least still better than any of the Shrek sequels). But it is nowhere near Pixar standard. Without the 3D element, I would have thought I was watching a direct-to-video animation on Disney Channel.Admittedly, part of Pixar's success came from their used-to-be unmatchable vibrant graphics. But the real charm has always, always been the stories. I used to cry when heard ""When she loved me"", now at the end of Brave I just want to laugh my butt off. So Disney-styled that you can tell the ending right from the start! First with Cars 2, now with Brave, I'm not sure I still have the courage to see Monsters, Inc. 2.

The Perfect Film,"""Brave"" is a phenomenal movie by Disney and Pixar Animation Studios. The quality of this film, from the perfected graphics to the deep storyline and everything surrounding it, is beyond any expectation I had conceived before walking into the theater. I honestly anticipated the content and characters to be a bit immature and lackluster for a more mature audience, but I was proved very wrong. The plot is quite complex for a children's movie and definitely one that will invoke strong emotions. I felt anger, despair, excitement, fear, and joy throughout the course of this awe inspiring flick, something very surprising due to the fact that this is coming from an individual who often considers himself emotionally calloused.The graphics of this film was more amazing than any other animated movie I've ever seen before. The strong underlying messages recurring throughout the story (i.e., forgiveness, faith, independence, open-mindedness, etc.) were powerful and prevalent; contrary to the concept that animated children's films are often childish (I being guilty of such thinking), ""Brave"" defies that by conveying meaningful concepts while still keeping the movie kid- friendly and comprehensible for younger viewers.My opinion may be a bit biased, of course, because I'm a big enthusiast of Germanic history, especially that of the Celts and their fascinating culture. Nonetheless, I can assure you that the myths and views depicted in Brave are accurate to the Celtic society and culture. ""Brave"" is a movie both children and adults will thoroughly enjoy. If you get the chance to see it in theaters (especially in IMAX 3D), then by all means go for it!TL;DR – ""Brave"" is a great animated film and I consider it my favorite Disney/Pixar movie of all time. The graphics are beyond amazing and the Celtic roots depicted are accurate to the history that inspired it. A lot of strong emotions will be felt throughout the course of the story and powerful messages, such as forgiveness, independence, and freedom, are conveyed in a strong albeit kid-friendly manner. Both children and adults will love this cinematographic work of art and you will DEFINITELY NOT BE DISAPPOINTED!",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Pixar's version of a 'bad movie',"Set in the mythical past of Scottish highlands comes a tale of bravery and the limits of family love. Fire-haired Princess Merida (Kelly Macdonald) is destined by tradition to become a promised wife. Nurtured and educated by her mother Elinor (Emma Thompson) she must always stay distinguished, even as her three young brothers let all hell loose on a daily basis. Her father, King Fergus (Billy Connolly) is more lenient, but also more interested in hunting down Mor'du, the great demon bear, than truly standing up for his daughter's independent spirit. Only once a year is Merida allowed to let loose - during her birthday. One year during such an escapade Merida comes across a witch (Julie Walters), who is attempting to enter a new career path as a wood carver. Nonetheless Merida convinces her to cast one last spell, which will allow her freedom to make her own decisions in life. As every such fairy tale spell the wish has dire repercussions...When Pixar makes a 'bad movie' it is still probably the best animated feature of the year. Naturally animation is perfected year after year, but this time around the story department falters delivering what seems like a substandard fairy tale. Characters are generally very affable, but somewhere along the rushed exposition the movie falls to real lift off when the end credits appear. Despite a few hilarious chuckles, especially centred around creative uses of Scottish kilts, the overall quality on every level is a few steps below what has become expected from the famed stable of animatrix, not to mention the uncomfortable mimicry of the ""My Brother Bear"" movie. It's a shame that the daughter-mother plot didn't receive a much better impact treatment, given the general characters populating the movie are actually pretty good base material for building a great story.",6.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
A mystical feel with great animation.,"The trailer actually does an excellent job of not giving the real plot line away. I was pleasantly surprised when I watched this and found it was not what I expected.The animation was really good, it set the atmosphere and was consistent throughout. However, I did not like the fact that the girls (Merida and the Queen) had to be so skinny while the men (especially the King) had to be huge. I guess during that time it was normal, but the contrast was too obvious, and just causes to strengthen gender stereotypes in children. What's the point of having the female protagonist rebel against tradition when she still has a stick figure that would get the little girls watching self conscious later on?I guess I'll have to complain on that point for just about every animation movie I watch. I don't think I've seen one without that body figure stereotype. If it's not the men being huge, then they're at least (almost) the same size as the women -- unrealistically skinny.Moving on, I originally thought Brave was about the princess going out and shooting arrows, and though she did, the movie wasn't entirely focused on it. I would have liked to see her shoot some more or maybe scenes of her learning to shoot.I did like the addition of the three brothers who added a comedic effect and were quite adorable. The film itself was well written and edited, which kept me interested along the way.Read more reviews at championangels.wordpress.com.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Another Pixar hit!,"Merida (Kelly Macdonald) is a free-spirited young girl with fiery red unkempt hair. She is skilled in archery and horseback riding; a young woman full of fire and spirit- she is also a Scottish princess, daughter of the bear-King Fergus (Billy Connolly) and Queen Eleanor (Emma Thompson). As a princess certain things are expected of her such as following the age-old tradition of betrothal. Merida feels hopeless in her situation and desperately seeks a way to change her mother's mind and ultimately to change her own fate. The feisty young princess gets what she asks for, but the transformation in her life isn't quite what she expected. The princess soon sees how hard it is to control a wild situation, just as her mother must have felt in trying to tame her daughter's wild spirit. Queen Eleanor in-turn experiences the great feeling of freedom and enjoys a time of wild abandon. In the end, the two find not only a deeper aspect of themselves but also a better understanding of each other, and with this new perspective they grow to love and respect one another, mending the bond that had been broken.Pixar has done it again with this exciting and humorous look into the not-so-traditional life of medieval Scottish nobility. The pressures and responsibilities of being royalty are captured by an endearing cast of characters; the three rambunctious little red-headed princes, the rebellious princess Merida, the fun loving King Fergus and the overbearing Queen Eleanor. Set in the beautiful Scottish countryside, the castle and forest are an enchanting setting for this magical family dramedy. As a whole ""Brave"" was a great movie and I highly recommend it for children and all families young at heart. You'll laugh a lot at the obvious fun as well as the hidden adult humor that Pixar is so great at incorporating into their films. You may even get a little teary-eyed in the end as the animated characters displayed very human emotions. Either way I'm sure you will leave the theater smiling and talking about this film for quite some time.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
"May not be Pixar's best, but still very good","While this doesn't quite rank alongside Pixar's very best work, it's very good. Animation-wise, I'd say it definitely ranks high up there, and it may even be their best. I could never successfully say how much I love Princess Merida's hair, for instance. It's just gorgeous, and used so perfectly in the film. Both the landscapes and the character animations are truly awe-inspiring. The flaws are in the writing, but they hardly destroy the movie. The story is too simple, too predictable. Major plot points happen too quickly and problems are solved a bit too easily. And it is perhaps a bit too slapsticky. I think Pixar was scared they couldn't get boys in the theater with their female protagonist, so they included a lot of lowbrow comedy. However, I would say it was never that bothersome to me. For the most part, I laughed when they wanted me to laugh. And I cried when they wanted me to cry. It is an involving story, and the mother/daughter relationship which is the focus is touching. Kelly MacDonald is wonderful in the lead (loved her forever, and so glad she replaced Reese Witherspoon) and Emma Thompson matches her in the mother role.

"Lesser work from Pixar, but that does not make it a lesser of a movie","There is a certain likability and pleasantness within the first few minutes of the movie and the same neither elevates nor diminishes for the rest of the runtime. May not be on par with other greater Pixar works but still had enough juice to hold on its own. There are a lot of father-son, father-daughter bonding movies but hardly any mother-daughter ones at least as a central plot which adds to its freshness. Pixar's tried and tested and never out-of-fashion formula is applied to the full extent and it works great too.Merida (voice by Kelly Macdonald) is a first born daughter to the king of a warrior clan who is prepared her entire life by her mother (voice by Emma Thompson) to be a courteous princess. Merida's exposure and incredible skill with archery, adventurous mindset and a lack of heed for the customs and traditions leads her to go against her mother when the time comes to choose her a groom. She approaches a witch to change her mother in turn her fate which results in a serious complication. With time running out, she learns an important lesson that also changes the fate of their kingdom.There are a lot of inspirations drawn from other successful non-Pixar movies like 'How to train your Dragon', 'Shrek' and 'Madagascar' which is unlike Pixar as they have been the trend-setters of animation so far. The sweet Scottish accent used by most characters especially the mother-daughter duo works beautifully. The animation though wonderfully presented, does not have enough innovation.

The makings of a classic,"A classic is a most peculiar thing. It is a story that seems faintly familiar, like a path one has walked down a long time ago, and has almost entirely forgotten. It may not seem to be shiny and new, or to be exceedingly original, but there is a certain something about it that makes us read it (in the case of a book) or watch it over and over again. It does not lose charm through multiple viewings – they only add to our understanding.""Brave"" is such a movie as I should bravely declare a classic. In the very best sense of the word. This film is thrilling. It's filled with magic, wonder, humour and action, with memorable characters and what's more, it conveys truly valuable messages. It may be a story about love, but it is on no account a love story like we have been used to see Disney do – without wanting to spoil anything which I (a girl who always hated the fact that the princess needed to be saved) particularly delighted in. It is in short, the sort of story I would have loved to bits as a child and that still admire now – with a heroine, who is certainly a better role model for any girl (and boy) than all of the Disney princes and princesses combined. This film is more than just entertainment, it has incredible moral value. But the entertainment doesn't fall short. It's hilarious, it's fast paced, it's full of suspense to the very last moment and it's absolutely visually stunning. The character animation is utterly gorgeous, real actors could hardly have been more convincing. It's 3D animation at its very best, and is well worth watching in 3D. The 3D is very well done and does not hurt the eyes, it is more like looking through a window than anything else and it really does add to the experience. There are two other things that I should like to recommend: Watch this film with your family, and stay for the credits. Not merely because of the after credits scene, which is lovely, but because the people who worked on it deserve it.I must admit, I dearly hope there will be no sequel. This film is so truly wonderful that it is very well able to stand on its own.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
The clearest sign of Disney's influence affecting Pixar's output,"Since the 1995 release of Toy Story, Pixar was the unbreakable house with its stream of hits catering for both children and adults. Now in its seventeenth year of feature film production, it seems that it is the house of Disney that is most affecting their cinematic output. This years Brave, continues the standard of breathtaking animation, but does not innovate in this field - as was usually expected. Unfortunately, whilst previous hits such as Finding Nemo (2003), Wall-E (2008), and Up (2009), brought inventive new animation tricks, they also brought to the screen some fundamentally beautiful innovations to animated storytelling. Not only did they manage to enthral and delight children, the studio managed to amuse and cater for the parents (and adults without children), in a manner that seemed more, well, adult.Brave tells the traditional fairytale set in the Scottish highlands. A young, red-haired princess, Merida (Kelly MacDonald), is forced by tradition to be married off to a young man from another clan, something that will be determined with an archery contest. Merida, however, does not wish to be married off and argues with her mother, Quenn Elinor (Emma Thompson). Taking off on her steed, she encounters a witch in the woods (voiced by Julie Walters), and she collects a spell in the form of a cake, that will change her mother, so that she will not have to marry. Unfortunately, the cake changes her mother physically, and in the form of a bear, they must break the spell.Whilst not groundbreaking in animation or storytelling, Brave does have heart. The plucky princess wants to break tradition, making it an interesting feminist concept within the context of children's entertainment. It also holds the strong message that age divisions should stop to listen to each others own wishes (here the mother- daughter relationship is strained due to this lack of communication). But unfortunately, the film seems simply to tread themes and story ideas that have been exhaustively explored by Disney's more traditional output, with slight modernisations. And this is the problem I have with this release. Perhaps it is due to the complete merger between Pixar and Disney that the more conventional stories will begin to be their output. I really hope that this is not to be the beginning of the demise of Pixar's genuine genius. But criticism of their latest releases may aid the studio in developing the kind of stories that bring in kids, and entertains the parents/adults also.With some other great voice work though (Billy Connolly, Robbie Coltrane, Kevin McKidd), the film is not a total failure, and will delight children. It does have some genuine laughs, particularly from Merida's younger triplet brothers, whose mischievousness brings some delectable comedy moments. Something other is also happening to cinema, and that is the influence of video games. Whilst Merida is ""on her quest"", she is often helped by willow-the-wisps (small illuminated apparitions), that direct her through forests to get to her destination. The unfortunate thing about this is that none of them sounded like Kenneth Williams - what a missed opportunity. Although, I guess they simply didn't know the reference.

Very good.,"We all have different opinions, I really loved this movie, the moral was great, and the concept was amazing, I've watched it so many times to the point that I knew nearly all the lines. It definitely looks away from what we would usually see.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Great and touching,"Many reviewers have bad opinion about this movie. Many have mediocre opinion as well, but there are some of us that thinks that Brave is great. Oscar winning is not an absolute measure, but still reveals something about quality. Roger Ebert which is not among us anymore and which reviews I admire a lot, wrote that this movie kids will love, while parents will not. I am not a parent but I am in a mature age to be one, and I liked it. It even brings tears on, which only few movies, and not one animation till this one did. I will not put much criticism about it, but it is very subjective opinion of such admiration from me. The animation is really amazing, and the sceneries are fascinating. I am myself a fan of anything Scotissh and Irish, so the complete background of the movie fits more than well to me. It is funny, sometimes very funny, and it is very emotional, especially the ending, which is very happy indeed. I don't know much about background story of it, but I really liked it a lot, and I think there must be an audience that liked it same as me. It is innocent, brave and very positive; like the animation movies I remember from the old days.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
A delightful family film,"Pixar is known for being one of the best studios around and certainly the best animation studio, making many films that are critical and commercial hits. But Pixar's stellar record took a big blow with the release of Cars 2, Pixar's first critical flop and commercially one of Pixar's weakest films. They needed strong follow-up and whilst its rating is not as strong as high as other Pixar Brave is still a very delightful family film.In a medieval Scottish kingdom Merida (Kelly Macdonald) is a rebellious teenage princess who is skilled at archery and wants to decide her own fate. But her mother, the regal and diplomatic Queen Elinor (Emma Thompson) who wants her to act as a princess and teaches her everyday how to act. When she humiliates her mother during a ceremony Merida runs off into the woods and meets a witch (Julie Walters) who promises she can change Merida's destiny with a spell. But of course when there are witches and magic around things go array and Merida ends up with more then she bargained for.The animation is stunning to look at. The designs of the people, scenery and buildings were fantastic, being very colourful and detailed: it is so noticeable when you look at Merida's ginger hair. The directors are able to get to sink the audience into a wonderful medieval world and there are great camera movements that make the action flow wonderfully.Brave had a troubled production: it was originally going to be the first Pixar film to be directed by a woman, Brenda Chapman before being replaced by Mark Andrews. The film was originally intended to be a Brother Grimm's style fairy that was called The Bear and the Bow and was set to star Reese Witherspoon. What we got was a typical Disney Princess story of a young girl who wants to defy the conventions of her society and gets mixed up in a magical plot. There are certainly elements of films like The Little Mermaid and Aladdin as well as homages to Pinocchio and Robin, but the production was able to twist these elements. There is no wicked stepmother character trying to seize the throne or be evil and the witch is more misguided then evil. The basic themes of the mother-daughter, the misunderstanding between the two as Queen Elinor wants to do the best for her daughter and her kingdom. The other theme is the characters that have to uphold they role of duty and ceremony whilst wanting freedom to control their lives. It is a balancing act the characters have to learn to understand other and how they roles in society.A great voice cast was assembled for the film, Macdonald, Thompson, Billy Connery being the main three and many excellent actors like Kevin McKidd and Robbie Coltrane in minor roles. For an actress in her 30s was brilliant as teenage character, giving a real performance as she showed the range of emotions and actions the character goes through. Macdonald was a better casting choice then Witherspoon because she would have been too big of a name for the film.Brave does supply on the comedy stakes, giving us plenty of physical comedy and verbal jokes. It is really funny seeing a bear trying to be regal. It is funny film but Pixar's strength is also delivering a heart story with subtle, real emotion and some fine action sequences. The film does follow the Hero with a Thousand Face formula as both Merida and Elinor learn from their journey.The first 30 minutes and the final act are excellent pieces of cinema, with great drama and comedy, plenty of action and focused on its themes of family relationships and female empowerment. But the middle was when there was a little dip in quality. The second act is still good and better then most films, but it felt like a different film: particular the crooky witch. The witch even leaves an answering message that felt like it belonged more to a Shrek film then a Pixar or Disney film. The humour from the witch did not seem to match the rest of the film.Brave is a great family film. Pixar has made better film in the past but it is still an excellent watch shows that Pixar do put a lot of effort in their films. Boys, girls and adults will enjoy the film. It is easily the best Scottish set medieval film. Please note I really hate Braveheart!",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Not that brave in terms of storytelling,"Brave is not nowhere on par with the rest of Pixar's films. It lacks the emotional depth and that 'original story' that Pixar cultivated in many of its film. Merida for a Disney princess, she's well drawn, she's got a good character that makes her a standout from the other princesses. She's independent, free-spirited, rides on horse and very good at archery. But as a main character in her own story she's very hard to be emotional connected to, and she come out as somewhat unlikable. The film's plot is very unoriginal and predictable, and it's got the old Disney tropes like curse, witch, forest and the before-sunrise thing.Technically it's very amazing ; The animation is top-notch as per usual for a Pixar movie; The fantasy elements and magical depictions are lovely, Merida hair's is very well done, the forests and landscapes are all breathtaking. The Voice acting is also impressive, the accent is spot-on. The soundtrack is memorable and does fits the atmosphere, it's got the Irish tones to it.On the whole, Brave fails to provide an original story and engaging narrative but it does impress with amazing visuals, strong voice acting, and some themes that many people that relate to.",6.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
A Nutshell Review: Brave,"Under tremendous pressure from being an offspring of one of the juggernauts in the CG animated film arena, Brave was courageous enough to go for the familiar that Disney had to offer, but done in Pixar's style. We have a female director in Brenda Chapman at the helm, who co-wrote the screenplay with Steve Purcell, Mark Andrews and Irene Mecchi, which like in fairy tales, takes place with Kings and Queens, Princesses and Princes, Witches and Magic Spells, rooted in old Scotland. It's Scottish and the filmmakers aren't apologetic about the heavy accents, and the protagonist is a teenage girl, which fits the mold of the famous princesses under Disney's fold. Fiercely independent with a mind of her own, and always eager to question, with a penchant to break tradition, Merida (voiced by Kelly Macdonald) isn't your typical demure princess, but like Disney princesses in recent years, have grown to encapsulate values of the modern woman, with abilities to equal, or even surpass, the many burly men, and none too burly peers, rather than to be the typical damsel in distress.This is probably the very first mother-daughter story arc for Pixar, and one of the rare few like The Invincibles and Ratatouille that has human protagonists. Chapman and team bring about a lot of female sensitivity when crafting the characters here, and this especially stands out in both Queen Elinor (Emma Thompson) and Merida of course, with the former being a proponent of tradition, and very much a stickler for protocol, that women in their position should know how to conduct themselves, and avail themselves for marriage to seal alliances and such. Merida on the other hand, is that quintessential tomboy, never batting an eyelid at scaling mountains and walls, or charging through the forests with her horse, and is a formidable archer to boot. Doted, she finds her birthright stifling, and most of the first act sees her self-sabotage at a Games conducted to find her a beau from three clans. This is natural avenue for comedy to happen given the varied abilities of her suitors, and the family background they come from.But the distinction in Brave, comes from the mother-daughter tussle, with both sides failing to appeal to the other to listen. In a rebellious response, Merida runs away from home, only to encounter the Witch (Julie Walters), whose help Merida enlists to conjure a magic cake in order to change her mom's attitude, but this of course presents something quite expected given the blatant clues left lying around. It's a classic tale of being careful with what you wish for, and then the tale of regret in desire a revert to what once was. It's not going to be easy, and with help from her triplet brothers (who inevitably are primed to steal the show, with spin off potential at the side), Merida has to make things right before the deadline of two sunrises.As always, Pixar's animation quality is impeccable, and the studio seemed to have cracked one of the holy grails in how vivid one can make a character's hair appear to be. This is no Tangled, and throughout the film you can really sense how Merida's bright red hair would have felt, with the action scenes providing much of a challenge for air, erm, hair flow, and you'd really be convince it's probably real hair up there on screen. The animals in the film, from horses to bears, are also very well detailed, and it's as close to what one would expect from the animal kingdom as possible. Like most animated films from Disney and Pixar, Brave also had some relatively off moments in its comical scenarios, given that for the most parts it's fairly dark in mood, with scenes that deal with the occult and magical beings.What I had enjoyed about the film, is how simple it took the notion of things happening for a reason, and made it a critical emotional punch. It boiled down to having a solid story and crafting characters whom you will care for, or grow to care about. And if you'd take a step back, you'd also probably realize that the magic cake did really make Merida's wish come true, albeit in a very roundabout fashion. Things may not seem like they are in effect at the time, but usually with the benefit of hindsight, you'd come to appreciate why certain things happened in a certain way to ultimately achieve the results one desires. The witch had her chance for redemption, given an earlier and grave mistake made that had effected a lower profile of a wood cover, and took it well, confident enough not to warrant any follow up scenes, except perhaps to fulfill a promise shown at the stinger at the end of credits.Merida, without a doubt, joins the ranks of the other classical Disney Princesses. Highly recommended!Like all Pixar feature films, I'd always look forward to the short film that precedes the main feature proper, and the tale here, La Luna, deals with a little boy's ingenuity, in a fantasy tale about how the Moon can change its look, thanks to a three-generation family of grandfather- father-son who have this thankless task of sweeping up reflective stars from the surface of the moon. Beneath the cute looking facades of the characters - the father with a bushy moustache and the grandfather with an incredibly long beard - this short film tells about how one finally becomes one's own man, with some support given from one's kin. Again this shows off Pixar's storytelling ability in making a touching film, sans spoken dialogue. Absolutely beautiful.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Good!...,"I first have to praise the animators at Pixar, the film really does look quite stunning, as we've come to expect. I will put aside the many historical inaccuracies or I could be here all day; needless to say, a lot of poetic license has been used. There were some really comic moments which I found quite refreshing, but the general narrative was skewed towards a female audience (I felt). Not that that's a bad thing; I still found myself wrapped up in the story as much as I would have been if it had been a more male orientated work. Over all, it's very enjoyable with some great comic moments. Definitely one for mothers and daughters rather than fathers and sons, but still worth a look if you have the inclination.SteelMonster's verdict: RECOMMENDEDMy score: 7.3/10You can find an expanded version of this review on my blog: Thoughts of a SteelMonster.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Beautiful film,"Just a quick review to counter a lot of the miserable sods I see writing here.It's a simple and beautiful film about mother and daughter learning to communicate and express their love. And it's as great as any other Pixar or Disney film in that respect.It has good characters. It is chock full of the usual mix of slapstick and cheeky humour.The message is a good one. You can break with tradition. In fact doing so is often necessary to escape the errors of the past. And there are two perspectives to each family battle. Understanding the motives of the other is key to effective communication.Recommended for all who enjoy great Disney stories, full of fun and vivacity and a solid moral core :)",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Maybe I'm just holding Pixar to too high of a standard.,"Brave is kind of bland. It doesn't have the same heart, wit or power that other Pixar films have.

red past,"When you are a child, you seldom choose the films you watch. In a normal free world environment, a child will probably fall victim to the laws of the moment, to whatever is on. Of course over that there is the influence the educators may have on you, but that will profoundly vary from child to child, and every child will still see and contact the trends of his moment. I was lucky enough, i suppose, to be partly fed by Pixar as i grew up. The Toy Story thing was a part of my upbringing. Later when i started watching films seriously, and specially when i started mapping my living in the space (as an architectural student), i understood the importance of the cinematic stakes that Pixar was playing all along. The space, the movement the camera.Well, that seems to be suspended, at least for the moment. PIxar is now Disney, and that shows. The themes are aligned with what Disney knows that sells, and that contrives the whole creative process that used to be groundbreaking for each Pixar project.The space narrative is abandoned, and i can understand that specially in this film, because the space had potential. We had the castle, we had the highlands. Outside and inside, and infinite possibilities. But the framing, the movement of the camera, the quality of the cinematic space, all that is gone, sacrificed so that we can have the repented child trying to mend the wrong she has made to her mother, trying to put the world to the happy end that Disney requires to keep their ticket buyers tuned in, satisfied, and with the sense that they took their children to see a film with a ""moral"", with something to think about.Everything creative seems to have been invested in the main character, the girl, who Is interesting. She lives on her hair, and the scene where she receives the claimants to her hand is remarkable in how much of the character is gone by the covering of her hair. The slipping hank is a wink, i suppose.That redness, and the expression of the character through it may be the one redeeming feature of this film. But i feel deceived, i feel that a person i used to visit since i was a child is no longer there to give wisdom.

"Not a classic Disney film, but still very good.","BRAVESo for Christmas, my parents got me a few of the Disney films missing from my collection. Today I watched Brave. I had never seen this one before which is not like me... I normally see them in the cinema, but for some reason this one passed me by.The movie is about a Scottish princess who is being forced to get married, but she really doesn't want to. So one day when going through a forest she stumbles across a witches house, she decides to purchase a spell from her to change her mother. The problem is, she wanted to change her mothers opinions on the forced marriage... instead she changed her mother into a bear. Now she has to find a way of changing her mother back into a human before her father finds the bear. Her father kills them.It is a great story, but I am sure Disney have done this before... or at least very similar. Brother Bear is similar to this. There are obvious differences, but they are both about them trying to find ways of changing someone important back from a bear.The animation is brilliant as always, but I find it very hard to fault Disney of their animation. I honestly believe they are the best in the world.As always there are some musical numbers in the movie. They were quite good, but not very memorable. They just didn't seem to have the typical Disney hook. They were not very catchy. But they still fit in with the movie quite well.There were some very funny moments in the movie which made me and my family laugh.The voice work was also very good like normal, the only problem I would say with it though is, there were a lot of famous people used for the voice work in this movie, but I only recognised one voice. They really could have just got anyone to do the voices. The main recognisable voice was done by Billy Connolly. He has such a distinctive voice that I could tell, it was him straight away. Other voice artists were Kelly Macdonald, Emma Thompson, Julie Walters & Robbie Coltrane. I didn't know these guys did the voices until the end credits of the movie.If you are a fan of Disney, then I recommend this to you. It is very entertaining for you and the kids. Yet again Disney did not disappoint.I will give this film 7 out of 10.""If you had a chance to change your fate, would you?""For more reviews, please like my Facebook page:https://www.facebook.com/pages/Ordinary-Person-Movie- Reviews/456572047728204",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
The new paradigm of the Disney princesses.,"This animated film is set in medieval Scotland and focuses on the figure of the young Princess Merida. Opposing the idea of ​​marriage by obligation, the young rebel runs away and seeks a way to change her mother's ideas, with severe consequences. Its a film based on the old maxim ""beware of what you want, for it can come true in a way that is not what you had in mind."" Following a recent norm, Disney-Pixar have created an adorable princess who seeks to adapt to the new mentality of modern women. She's not a crying princess who needs to be saved, like Snow White from the 1930s. She is a girl full of personality, with very concrete ideas, she knows what she wants, she just does not know how to do it. And, as has happened in many of the most recent films (Tangled is a good example), it emphasizes the absence of a male hero and the weaknesses of male characters, a fundamental part of its comic essence. We could almost say that it seems that Disney-Pixar came to see men as the weak sex.Mérida is adorable in every way, and its very easy to think of several women in our lives who resemble her, which increases our identification with the character. Her mother is protective and caring, but she can not understand her daughter's wishes. The father, a warrior with passion for bears hunting, is a braggart who adores his children and is almost controlled by his own wife. The animations are excellent, made with great realism and care. The voices are borrowed by a good cast of voice actors, and were thought to try to reproduce the Scottish accent, thus fitting into the mood of the film. The soundtrack and songs do not bring anything new or stay in the ear, but play their role well. Pixar has always been more concerned with the visual aspects than with the songs of its films.In short, Brave is a very good movie and deserves to be seen by the whole family. More aimed at girls, it will definitely appeal to boys as well as adults.",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Subpar Pixar effort,"This movie looks fantastic. When that's out of the way there is not much more to be optimistic about. the story is one of the lowest quality efforts from Pixar/Disney in their(Pixars) entire lifespan.Without spoiling anything, it is safe to say that Pixar/Disney did not explore a completely fantastic and heartfelt story opportunity which even shows it self early on in the movie. Instead it turns into a Laurel and Hardy flick with no depth to reach the hearts of the audience.Elements lending them selves to 25 years of gaming clichés does not help the over all expression. (Visps - you know it when you see it, they are in the trailer as well)Following epics such as Wall.E and Up this feels awkward in many ways. Pixar might change lanes, they might not. Earning money by making sub-par productions has never opted a change of style though.Pixar has run out of the famous ""napkin movies"", then made Up which turned out fantastic, hopefully they'll figure out how to ""do it"" again.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

"Nice graphics, but nothing new here.","In this story of a Scottish princess Merida having to cope with the responsibilities thrust upon her by her lineage by initially rebelling against it and (obviously) finally settling for it, there's little in terms of originality. The story is rather slight, the casting a bit obvious, even though some of the Scottish accents are rather strained. It's all strictly formula, covered up with the high quality animation we've come to expect from Pixar studios. Someone apparently decided that the main character was to have extremely wrong, bright red curly hair, and it's plain to see that a lot of effort has been put into making Merida's hair move to and fro quite naturally. It's a bit too obvious as a showcase and I wish they had put more effort in creating a more compelling storyline and some interesting supporting characters, neither of which is apparent. Brave is graphically well made, but in terms of story-telling there's not that much to recommend it. Looks good, is never really boring, but there's nothing truly original to be found here, unfortunately.",6.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Wonderful! One of Disney Pixar's Best films!!,"The character development in this film is very very advanced . I especially appreciated the sense of humor and brevity that was brought into many of the main characters. The main theme was related to coming of age which I feel a lot of people can relate to. I also enjoyed the movie's score. So great I didn't want the movie to end and was sad when it did. Almost brought me to tears at some points.

Wanted SO much to like it,"Just took my twin 13 year old daughters to see Brave and we all wanted to like it but the film didn't help us much.Pixar is kind of the Stanley Kubrick of animation studios. Meaning they have been so preternaturally stunning with each of their films, they have set the bar so high, with so many ground breaking, narratively bulletproof films, that when they turn out an ill conceived, bland, and sadly boring film like this, we give it less leeway than we would other mortal film companies like Dreamworks Animation or even Disney. I'm sure Kubrick felt the pressure later in his career to create greatness as much as Pixar head John Lassiter does. And much like Kubrick's streak of great films, maybe Pixar's run as come to a close as well.And the fact that it is such a utter cookie cutter entry like Disney has been turning out for years is alarming considering John Lassiter is now running both Pixar and Disney Animation. I hope he isn't spread too thin and being tainted by the lost and wandering Disney brand.I'm not sure why Pixar felt the need to get into the uber saturated princess business. Kinda seen every permutation of that story a few times over. The only thing I could say as a positive on the film, is that the animation of the princess herself is first rate, her luminescent skin, her flowing red hair, is quite an accomplishment. And that might have been enough for another studio, but Pixar has to hit it out of the park each time which has got to be kind of daunting but that's what comes along with greatness I guess.",3.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
"We laughed, we cried, we LOVED it!!","I took my 3 kids and my mom to see this a couple weeks ago and I keep forgetting to post a review. We all LOVED this movie SOOOOO much. It was really funny and kept the kids (and adults) laughing and entertained (except my 3 yr old son who fell asleep at the end but I blame that on the fact that we were there at nap time b/c it was the only non-3D show). There were 3 times when I got tears in my eyes and I looked over and my mom had them too. If you've ever made mistakes as a mother or a daughter it will get you too, for sure. There were a couple times that my girls (5 and 7) got scared but it wasn't nearly as bad as the Lion King (they still refuse to watch that one again). They were over it quickly after the scene was over. My mom just told them ""it's just a movie and in movies everything always ends up OK"" which satisfied them). As I said, we didn't go to the 3D one b/c my kids HATE 3D movies (mostly wearing the glasses) so I can't comment on that part. Though I really wish Disney would quit making EVERY. SINGLE.

Also the Luna cartoon in the beginning was really boring for them and there was no talking/very little music so my son laughed at something and everyone in the theater glared at him b/c it was so quiet.

Pixar creates a decent Disney Princess,"Apparently Pixar decided they needed a princess of their own, and came up with a feisty Scottish redhead. She's a pretty likable princess, which is good because she's the only significant character in the movie, and her rather predictable emotional journey is meant to keep things in motion.Overall, the movie's copious humor is far less successful than its occasional action. The comedy is very mild, and I rarely laughed out loud, but the sudden appearance of an angry bear and a final urgent forest ride are genuinely exciting.While likable, the movie has to be considered a lesser Pixar film.

Pixar Know How To Tell A Good Story,"A more conventional fable than what we have come accustomed to from Pixar, but a solid one none the less. While it may not stand amongst their creative best, the film is still a stunningly animated delight. It is supported by a strong central character and a mother-daughter relationship that resonates with the film's central value of family. It's a tale that will appeal to both adults and children alike.It is mostly disappointing as the film plays it quite safe as compared to previous Pixar films and it becomes decidedly predictable by the end. However that's the problem when you build such a fantastic repertoire for animated films, expectations are always high for the next. This shouldn't detract from the fact that the film deserves all the success it gets and to the people who were already disappointed by Cars 2 (which i still enjoyed), Pixar is back to its roots here- prioritizing telling a good story first.",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Beautiful looking but conceptually a bit messy...,"I do not think that Brave belongs on the list of transcendental, virtually perfect Pixar classics. Granted, it definitely contains some of the most beautiful computer animation that I have ever seen. Ten years ago, who would have thought that computer-generated hair could be so breathtakingly exciting? I love the hair (and fur) in Brave! But my problem with this movie is that it feels conceptually disjointed. Yes, the story is pretty easy to follow on a basic level, and yes, it is entertaining. The thing is that the main point/moral just comes across as forced, which means that, for me at least, all of the great individual elements do not add up to a greater whole. ""Brave"" is a wonderful title, but the film itself struggles to bring it home by the time that the credits roll.

Last year it was Cars 2 and now this? What's wrong with Pixar?,"Ever since 2003 when they started having a yearly release (except for the 2005 break), Pixar films were a MUST in summer movie guides. The fact that they started getting a yearly Academy Award nomination for Best Animated Picture, just convinced us that the appeal wasn't just in our minds, and on top of that two consecutive nominations for Best Picture (which makes Pixar the only animation production company that has managed to get those since Disney with Beauty and the Beast). We wouldn't mind whether the trailer was appealing or not; or if the story seemed good... you may have even thought: ""meh... I don't think this one's gonna be better than the last one""... However, you would like it. Period.But after last year's ""Cars 2"" and this year's ""Brave"", it seems like we're gonna have to start analyzing whether to go watch a Pixar release or not, which is something you just didn't do. That's a huge fail for Pixar, cause they're gonna start loosing market. It will be just like Dreamworks. Sure they have ""Shrek"" and ""How to train your dragon""... But they also have ""Shark Tale"", ""Flushed Away"" and ""Over the hedge""... (Not to mention all the other Shrek films)You get it? Pixar being good is not a 'law' anymore. Whether the film was good or not, used to be a generalized ""Two thumbs up""... Now it depends on opinions. (And most of them are just not good)I'm glad the Academy punished them last year by not giving ""Cars 2"" a Best Animated Film nomination. I don't think ""Brave"" deserves one either, and if they give it, it will be based on graphics and animation more than for the film as a whole. (Although it wasn't nearly as bad as Cars 2)They're gonna have to do some serious changes in the way they're choosing their stories, for us to get back that ""Pixar = good"" concept we used to have.I'm pretty sure ""Monsters University"" wont disappoint us at all! But it's gonna take them more than one good film to get back to the top, plus, since there's only one yearly release, we're gonna spend the rest of the year with that bad flavor. So Pixar, be careful with what you release after that one...Now I KNOW THIS ISN'T A PIXAR REVIEW, but the expectations most of us had, were base on the fact that it was Pixar. SO LET ME TELL YOU WHAT WENT WRONG WITH THIS MOVIE, in my opinion.First, The lack of comedy. After Hilarious Finding Nemo and Monsters Inc. I think it's a Pixar trademark. Up and Ratatoille were not comedy- centered but it wasn't a missing ingredient. As far as I'm concerned, the triplets were the only comedy we saw.Second, The Characters. Besides Merida's Father, none of the characters were interesting. And if they were, they weren't fun to watch. You would expect a lot of fun from watching the queen dealing with becoming a bear but it really wasn't. The Witch scene was more a WTF moment rather than an interesting, mysterious or funny scene. The villain, in this case the giant bear, just wasn't a good one. You would very little fear it, and almost don't know anything about it. It's intentions against Merida and her mom were basically hunger. And don't even get me started with the leaders of the troops and their boring sons.Third. The Story. It didn't seem so bad. That was before Merida ran into the woods with Angus. Starting with the way her mother became a bear, to the way she broke the spell. It was pretty lame. I got the feeling it was starting to get good when they went into the other bear's cave and the truth about the bear was revealed, but a few minutes later, that was over and the story was lame again.Fourth. The Trailer. Everything good about the movie just seemed to be squeezed into the trailer. Not to mention I find it very misleading. You never quite find out what the movie really is about until you're in the movie theater. It's like the production company predicted the whole bear thing was going to repeal the audiences, so they decided to avoid putting it in the trailer to trick everyone into watching it.I really think the movie wouldn't have been as bad with better directing. But what are you gonna do?",6.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Pixar did it again !,"**ATTENTION SPOILERS**I don't really know how to react towards this movie, i was thinking of all the good reviews it got and focusing on that 'it has to be good, it has to be good'Negative Points :The first 27 mins i was like 'Wow, nothing special yet, is this a Pixar movie ?', literally nothing special.I didn't like the beginning of it ! i thought it was too commercially if that's the right phrase, i barely smiled, and i disliked the triplets, i thought they're trying too hard to make them look cute !I thought it was somehow fast paced, especially when it comes to the connection between Mother and Daughter, even when a fast paced movie doesn't bore you, but in these scenes especially they should have been a bit slower and more detailed.Positive Points :It has Pixar's heart in it.The animation is definitely the best Pixar animation so far.The details are breathtaking, there is a lot of realistic stuff, yet some of the clearly-animated scenes to remind you that you're watching an animated movie, a very good one.The music is just perfect for the movie, with the scenes and the accent and the atmosphere, i thought it was just lovely and suitable for the movie, can't get any better for sure.Even though i didn't like the beginning of it, but the scene where they started to fight caught my attention, i thought it was beautifully animated/written/directed, i didn't get bored of the movie not even for a sec.The bonding scenes were fast paced true, but it convinced me a bit, it could have been better, but i think it was quite alright ! especially after we meet Mor'du.Like i said, it has Pixar's heart in it, Pixar's other movies got to me more, but i would be lying if i said that Brave didn't get to me in some scenes, which made me satisfied, since i got used to Pixar movies moving me.And one last thing, the four kings tale ? FREAKING AWESOME ! the story is amazing, and i loved how they put it in the movie, and how it ends, it's just  ahh, i wish they made the movie about it somehow !Characters :Merida : i like her, i love that she's kinda immature and a bit selfish ! and her reactions towards her mother ! she would rank 6th or 7th on my list ! i'm not sure though.Elinor : I thought the changing of personality kinda surprising and sudden, but meh, i liked her as a bear more.Fergus : Fun .. and well, fun !The Triplets : No, just no !Mor'du : i don't care if he didn't say a word and barely was there, i love him.It's not the best Pixar movie, but it's really good, definitely worth watching. I know i have to watch it again, i may change my mind about some things.",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
I expected more...,"Brave is good family entertainment but compared to other Pixar movies I can only say it's below par. Why? Because at over 30 minutes into the movie I still had no idea what this movie was going to be about? Would Merida (the title character)grow to become some sort of heroine defending her people? Would she face some incredible enemy? The actual story and motivation behind Brave is more trivial. Sure, I had my laughs and my daughters seem to have enjoyed the movie, it's just that Brave ain't no ""Finding Nemo"", nor ""The Incredibles"". Neither it is a ""Toy Story"" or even ""Bugs"". It feels like an underdeveloped story and probably under the hands of a better writer it could've been a more memorable film. A case in point: Merida's bow and arrow. With all the publicity posters having her with her bow and arrow and then seeing her in the movie being a master in archery, this ability is never ever developed. Merida just looks ""good"" holding a bow and arrow, that's it!Don't get me wrong: I enjoyed Brave, but it seems Pixar has raised the bar to high even for their own good.",6.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Better than expected,"I had heard a lot of mixed opinions on Brave. Perhaps no one had bashed it, but some found it satisfying while some just found it completely unremarkable. Because of the low expectations perhaps, I found myself really liking this. It moves quickly, and while it's completely formulaic and predictable from start to finish and the themes aren't anything nearly original, it was still pretty entertaining, and surprisingly, heartfelt. It actually moved me. I think some of the bad word-of-mouth comes because this is Pixar, known for making masterful animated films, and as good as this is, it just doesn't hit the heights Pixar usually does. But on its own, it is quite good and satisfying. However, this is the fourth animated film I have seen this year, and the other three are better and more deserving of the Oscar.Oh, and the three kid brothers, amazing.",,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Best Disney-Branded Fairy Tale Since Beauty and the Beast,"While Pixar has had many many many fantastic successes, and nearly every movie they've made has been a bonafide masterpiece, it seems like most people, critics especially, tend to view the three movies Pixar released from 2007-2009 as being the best in their 26 year, 13 feature history. Those movies were Ratatouille, WALLE, and Up; and they each featured high concept stories, deep and sophisticated themes, and, in many ways, spoke more to the grown-ups in the audience than they did to the kids while still being great movies for the entire family to enjoy together. These three films, which are arguably as close to perfect as any movie has ever come, combined with Pixar's nearly spotless history, unfortunately may have set the bar so high that no one, not even Pixar could ever hope to top it.That brings us to Brave. Let me just be upfront in saying that Brave is a *really* good movie. It has fantastic and fully realized characters, it has a strong emotional core, it has great performances, it looks stunning, and it has an absolutely beautiful soundtrack. The story is set in a mythical version of Scotland, where Princess Merida is about to be betrothed to the first born son of one of the three other Lords of the kingdom, however, Merida is not ready for marriage and, in fact, would much rather be free to make her own way in the world than be bound by the traditions of her kingdom. After a heated argument with her mother she flees the kingdom and happens upon a witch who gives her a spell that will allow her to change her fate.If a lot of this sounds familiar (and not just from the trailers of the film) you shouldn't be surprised as this essential formula is the basis to more fairy tales than you could count. However, where Brave succeeds is not in the creation of groundbreaking new ideas, but rather in the execution of telling a very classic story and bringing a new and fresh voice to it, much in the same way Disney did back in 1989 and 1991 with The Little Mermaid and Beauty and the Beast. Unlike many fairy tales of recent years, it does not rely on the conventions of the ""Disney Fairy Tale Musical"" as a crutch, but instead finds a way to make it uniquely their own.Pixar has always had a knack for creating incredibly endearing and heartfelt characters who, despite being animated, feel just as alive as any other person in the theater, and Brave is certainly no exception. The leap from Belle to Merida is just as significant as the leap from Princess Aurora (Sleeping Beauty) to Ariel. She's a character that I think will resonate not just with young girls, but with many women, especially the ones that are at the threshold of adulthood, and the relationship between her and her mother is very poignant.The story itself doesn't break any new ground, and if you've ever seen a fairy tale movie before you can call just about every plot beat a few minutes before they arrive, but that doesn't make the film any less effective because the execution is so spot-on. For the same reason you cry when the Beast dies despite the knowledge that, of course, he's going to come back to life you also are completely involved with the emotions and characters of Brave even though you probably already know how it's all going to turn out.Despite all this, the fact that this isn't an absolute revolution in cinematic history means that it won't live up to the ""Pixar legacy"" in many people's minds. I, however, have always considered Pixar's legacy to be more about the emphasis on characters and honest emotions than about breaking new ground and doing the unexpected. Sure, that's an important part of what's made many of their past successes great, but in my book that is still secondary to simply telling a solid story with great characters and sincere emotions, and with perhaps the exception of Cars 2, Pixar has never once forsaken that legacy. It may not be the best movie Pixar has ever made, but Brave is still a great film, and in my opinion the best fairy tale that Disney has put their name on since 1991.A-",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
"Beautiful Animation, Senseless script","Pixar lost a bit its essence and idiosyncrasy when it was engulfed by Disney. Since then, every second Pixar movie we get can be labeled Pixar's in conception, ideas and originality. The in-between years are for movies like Brave, which follow a ready-made template with structured predefined characters, values and jokes that are very much modern Disney. This is, moreover, Pixar's fist princess movie ever.Brave's animation is amazing from a visual point of view: the colors, layouts, backgrounds, the rendering of the landscapes and characters movement, the camera angling, the 3D design and even the movement of the hair of Merida are spectacular. Still, a good animation movie, to be successful, needs of a good script with a sound story and narrative: what it tells and how it tells it are always more important than how it looks like.Brave's script -by Mark Andrews, Steve Purcell, Brenda Chapman and Irene Mecchi- is, a priory, a winner, as it mixes many European folk legends and human archetypes (like the ones we see in Anderson or the Grimm Brothers' tales) with modern attitudes and sensibilities. Moreover, Merida is in a way, a combination of all the successful past Disney's heroines. Thus, Merida is a redhead tomboy princess, opinionated and rebel, super-woman at every level, living in a Medieval Scottish male dominated kingdom that is brought up to be a queen.The film is entertaining and beautiful to watch, and some of the characters are very funny. There are many funny moments especially those involving the witch, Merida's triplet brothers, and the lady bear.All the cast of actors do a good job at dubbing their respective characters: Kelly Macdonald as Merida, Billy Connolly as Merida's father, Emma Thompson as her mother, and Julie Walters as the Witch. To be completely honest, Billy Connolly's dubbing always sounds like himself not as the character he plays.Still, Brave does not deliver beyond the artistic qualities of the animation, because the story sends contradictory and senseless messages to the children it targets. It feels as if the writing team had done bit and pieces separately, and then stitched them together without further adjustment and polishing. Being so, the movie can be labeled, depending on the moment, of feminist, sexist, retrograde, modern, advanced or conservative. ""Obey your mother"" can be a revolutionary message in a world in which children are spoiled rotten and disrespect their parents, but going from there to deciding that everything mammy says is good for your future and that the tradition has to be respected no matter how senseless it is, it is a bit reactionary. On the other hand, the story tells us that you can be brave and daring, but until certain point - bravery is subversive, and subversion is not good. What?! Be brave and make your own fate, free will do exist, but fate is fateful and will crash you if you subvert the status-quo. What! What? What?!Too much is always too much. Brave is a beautiful senseless sermon that gets lost in its own wordiness and senseless preaching. It is perfect for small children, as it has lots of action and some funny moments that the little ones (and your inner child) will enjoy. More sounded boys and girl, our just your sound self, could get a bit puzzled at the moral of the story and the wordy ending.",6.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Tangled Vs. Brave,"Inadvertently I have watched this two Disney animations hand-in-hand (TANGLED is from the orthodox Disney branch while BRAVE is its flagship Pixar production), which seems to be a perfect paradigm to juxtapose them together and to dissect the state-of-the-art tendency of the mainstream genre (enormously profitable since its chief target are zero in on family with children, so it has a much more important and instructive obligation other than merely an entertainment for the toddlers and above).Coincidentally both films' heroines are princess (Rapunzel in TANGLED and a Scottish Merida in BRAVE), adapted from Grimm Brothers' tale, TANGLED is supremely reminiscent of Disney's other established princess analogs trapped in a magic world, let's say Snow White, Sleeping Beauty and Cinderella, what's more, there will always be a prince-charming to deserve and requite her love. Wisely Rapunzel's Flynn Rider has been sizeably modernized as a reckless, self-mocking yet conservatively ""Disney"" prince with a thief background.But in BRAVE, Merida is a much more radical rebel by blood, she doesn't have or need a prince with white horse (the film doesn't care to proffer one since all her tribe suitors are one-of-a-kind wackos), she is fighting against her predestined life path which her mother has arranged for her and her status has requested her, a tad thread-bone notwithstanding, but chronicling with a single-linear arc, the mother-daughter predicament has slipped to the hanging-by-a-thread situation when a magic spell transfigures the Queen's appearance into a bear which cannot be recanted after the second sunrise, therefore, instigates an intimate bonding phase for the two, viscerally the mutual love only exudes when something unusual happens, while living in the mundane life, we are all suffering and grated by the love with a insurmountable generation gap.Rapunzel, on the other hand, her main barrier is the ultimate breakthrough from her ""mother"" Gothel (a greatly overlooked Donna Murphy), who raises her and locks her up in the tower for 18 years, treats her as her own out of a selfish but very understandable motivation (to rejuvenate her youth), but out of any sequential transition, all of a sudden Rapunzel miraculously remember her princess identity (she was taken away when she was an infant, so I doubt there is any memory there, more like an implausible epiphany or actually a screenwriter's block), what's more unbelievably awkward is that she immediately snarls back to her ""mother"" as if all the recollections of Gothel's evil scheme has been replayed in front of her eyes and she has been tortured for all that year long (actually she is fairly happy and content alone with her cutesy chameleon) , which I deem as a child's play, very much panders to its core audience of pre-school demography.So, from a vantage point under the contemporary context, BRAVE is far more daring and enthralling from its ""no guts no glory"" premise, it is able to identify with a way broader audience, which is also the main ingredient of the winsome recipe ""why Pixar can keep excelling all its peers (if not itself) on the top-tier of the hierarchy"", in spite of that on a technical level, all the major animation studios in Hollywood (DREAMWORKS, BLUE SKY STUDIOS, etc.) are almost equally cutting-edge.Music is Disney's strong suit, the first half of TANGLED is a conventional musical showcase, culminating the saccharine romance with the Oscar-nominated theme-song I SEE THE LIGHT, fusing with an intoxicating lanterns-all-over-the-sky spectacle, this has always been the tactic to emit Disney's overblown sentimentality, I am certain it is no longer an all-age proof method now. In BRAVE, although Kelly Macdonald and Emma Thompson's heavy Scottish accents do not get along with my ears, the exotic score and tunes are generally agreeable, and what's more admirable, it doesn't steal the thunder of the film per se.Honestly speaking after the astonishingly-acclaimed WALL-E (2008, 9/10), UP (2009, 9/10) and TOY STORY 3 (2010, 9/10), I automatically skipped last years CAR 2 (2011), BRAVE is a left-field choice, the scale of the story has been slimmed down to a quite unimaginable mother-daughter clash, even grafting it on the most platitudinous soil of a princess's tale. But by good fortune, the film doesn't smear Pixar's paramount reputation, Merida goes through a well-deployed rite-of-passage and the sub-plots such as the blue wisps, the ancient lore of the discontent brother and the witch's hut are all positioned into the right niche to uplift the mythology and idiosyncrasy of the film.As for TANGLED, Disney will never relinquish its tradition (otherwise Walt Disney will definitely be jumping inside his tomb), and it is also an exquisitely-made piece of work, just unfortunately paled by comparison by BRAVE since there is no sparks glittering and all the chirpy happiness seems synthetic and a bit stale.",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Defintly not what you expect.,"When I saw the trailer for Brave, what I had in mind wasn't what I saw. Brave has an excellent plot built to trick you. The Title has little to do with the film, I find it was more about friendship and love.Even though the film has it's PG bits, Disney Pixar didn't forget to add Comedy and Humour - And this was one of its strongest points. - There is also a lot of magic and mystery built into the film and just like a puzzle it all fits in perfectly.Finally, the graphics, landscapes and the quality of this film were outstanding! Every day they make things look even more realistic. They say this film took 6 years to make and I can see that all the time the animators, crew, actors, etc. took was really worth it.This film is sure to amaze and amuse you and I recommend it very much.",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

Not so special but not that bad,"Enjoyable, especially if you don't know much about the movie and you stayed away from the trailers, I was surprised at the turn of events majorly the whole mother and daughter connection. A change from the regular, having a female lead is something, having two female leads and no romance or male attachment involved is a stab in the dark.Was I looking forward to what will happen next each time? YES.Brave is a 3D computer-animated fantasy adventure film from Pixar. It was set in the highlands of 10th century Scotland, and the lead role Merida is Pixar's first female protagonist. The movie is directed by Brenda Chapman who is Pixar's first female director and she also wrote the story.The thing I want you to look out for when you are watching this movie is Merida's brothers, those kids were a menace to the power of 3.Giving you the plot of the movie without revealing much is going to be quite hard, but I will try. Merida defies an age-old custom, causing chaos in her kingdom. After consulting with a witch for help, she is given a cake that caused a change of events in her family, now Merida has to undo the spell herself before it is too late.The movie's flow is kind of shallow, and the movie looked short, like more could have happened and it didn't. You will love the scenery and the way the women were different from the men in the area of manners and thought. The movie did drive a message though, that both mothers and daughters have to communicate, with both leaving room to understand the other. But the message may not go down well the male viewers who were probably looking for some action.Voice casting is a part of the movie I enjoyed. It was Scottish to the core.I can't say for certain if the movie will bring in the regular money that Pixar is use to too, but I do know it is not a bad watch. It is something you will enjoy.",6.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
My least favorite Pixar film.,"This movie should not have had Pixar slapped onto it, it's totally a Disney film trying to be Pixar. The movie.feels.like a jumbled up mess that combines elements of. Freaky Friday, Brother Bear, and The Little Mermaid all blended together. I never thought that Pixar would make such a mediocre film, when all their other films are amazing.

Bravehair,"This film is recommended.The title for the new Pixar / Disney collaboration, Brave, seems a bit of a contradiction of terms. Unlike other ground-breaking animated features like Ratatouille, Up, Wall-e, Finding Nemo, or its Toy Story trilogy, where artistry and story perfectly mesh, this offering plays it all too safe in its narrative while still awing the movie-going audience with breathtaking CGI effects. ( This film is more of a minor achievement, in line with Monsters, Inc. and Cars. ) Perhaps, the once edgy and creative Pixar is becoming more conventional and too much concerned with the Disney marketing machine. Hopefully that is not the case.The story is rather predictable and its message too preachy. An independently-minded princess ( sure to be in toy stores from the holidays ) named Merida wants nothing to do with marriage or hand-picked suitors to wed. Merida would rather climb mountains, ride horseback and shot arrows. It's girl power all the way! Her mother, Queen Elinor, would rather that her daughter be more ladylike and refined and follow the traditions of the past. This leads the princess to take matters into her own hands.The film's strengths are in the visual detailing. Pixar is known for its glorious textures and stunning settings, and in Brave, that continues to be its forte. ( The renderings of animal fur done in a photo-realistic style, the transparent liquidity of water and rain, the panoramic vistas of forests, fields, and streams, all these elements help to enhance this tale. Particularly impressive is the facile expressions and movement of the bears in this film and the stylish exaggeration of the film's secondary characters. ( Not so impressive: A major misstep are the characters of the Queen which lack any real dimension and our heroine, Merida, who becomes a living Kewpie doll creation, far too cute and rather bland in the mix. ) Voiceovers by Kelly Macdonald, Emma Thompson, Billy Connolly, and Julie Walters truly capture the Scottish lilt and add the right tone and rhythms to the dialog.However, the slim story never takes hold. It downplays the more serious dramatic issues and emphasizes the comedy. There is no good vs. evil side, no real villain to hiss at. ( One is introduced midway, but its seems an afterthought and doesn't build any tension at all. ) Everyone around the two strong-willed but essentially dull central characters of mother and daughter is portrayed as a clownish buffoon or an oafish lout. In fact, all of the male species in Brave serve as comic fodder while the women are seen to be far superior in intellect and manner. At times, I personally found this conflict to be chauvinistic to the male gender as the film exults the female liberation aspects in such a heavy-handed and biased way.Yet there are certain scenes in the film that are such wonderful examples of state-of-the- art animation and this artistry elevates the film to a higher level of worth. ( The archery contest, the fishing scene, and the climactic hunt come to mind. ) But the sum of the film's individual parts outweigh the overall effect. Brave might have been given the royal treatment by all of the artisans involved with this venture, but its pure-bred pedigree falls short of its Pixar predecessors. Let's hope their next project will center on a more demanding and compelling script and return this studio to its glory days of Ole.

Fairy tale,"Right up front you should know before you watch this: It's not ""How to train your Dragon"". In other words it's not as much a comedy as it is a fairy tale. I think the trailer was clear on that, but quite a lot of people seem to have been expecting different. Plus jokes do not equal story! I do understand if that is something that bothers people with the movie (like a friend of mine who told me, that he liked the Dragon movie better).Having said that, this still has comedy elements in it and you will laugh. But as with all the Pixar movies, they are concerned about the story. And while this sort of fairy tale has been told quite a few times, they still find fresh ways to tell the story. Which is quite simply amazing. The 3-D might not be that amazing, though you shouldn't take your glasses off halfway through the movie and then take it out on the movie (or the filmmakers for that matter).The voices are really good (some real Scottish talent at work including the one and only Craig Ferguson) and I loved the animation. Pixar itself can be called ""brave"" for not only tackling the fairy tale this way, but going female lead on us. And again they made it work ...",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

The Best Animated Movie of the Year,"Pixar does it again with Brave. Brave is the story of a young princess named Merida who is unhappy with the way things are mainly because of her overly controlling mother who wont let her have any freedom. the animation is amazing as always with pixar movies and i think its better than ever in brave. i literally almost wet myself laughing because this movie was straight up hilarious. its nice that for once there is a female lead in a pixar movie which i think opens up a lot of doors for pixar. im not gonna spoil the movie for you but you will not be disappointed. you will be cringing, crying, laughing and just having a great time. the best thing about this movie is that you do not know what is going to happen or what you're in for. you might think that you know whats going to happen next but you seriously wont expect what you are about to see. i guarantee you once you see this movie you're gonna want to see it over and over again. i give it a ten !",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Pixar Not a Level Above the Rest Anymore,"As I was finishing watching the new Pixar movie, I was trying to figure out how the title ""Brave"" fit into the film. It wasn't clearcut, other than a final bit of narration. I understand the original title was ""The Princess and the Bear"", and that is a more appropriate title. About half the movie follows the shenanigans of the young redhead and said bear. Does it work? Sure, the bear is given human qualities, but still can evoke a sense of danger. In general the complaint seems to be that the arc of the story doesn't push the envelope, things that you expect to happen with the story pretty much happen as planned. I decided to watch this movie in 3D, because I heard that the lush visuals helped make up for the simple story. This was true, so my final verdict is thumbs up, but it still fails to live up to the competition. The competition I am talking about is the excellent ""How to Train Your Dragon"", released a couple years ago.HTTYD was a surprise hit, combining memorable characters with some good fairy tale dragons, as well as teenage rebellion, etc. ""Brave"" ventures into similar territory, and frankly didn't entertain me as much as HTTYD. I think another story layer was missing. I think also that this director was not at the level of sophistication as former Pixar director Brad Bird, for instance. I can't say there was any point where I got bored, or where a character became annoying. The crowd I was a part of in the theatre was full of kids, and they laughed at every pratfall. There were only sparse moments of adult level humor, certainly not enough to deem this a mature film in any way.One thing I thought was a bit of a letdown was the confines of the film's environment. The scenes in the forest break new ground in terms of texture and colour. Half-rotted tree trunks with a variety of shades of green moss create super-real visuals that benefited from the 3D effects. But most of the film takes place in your run-of-the-mill castle, including an extended action scene that feels like a video game where you chase around endless hallways and stairwells.There is certainly nothing to bemoan this latest CG animated film now seemingly lost in a glut of animation releases these days. We all know Pixar can do better, and I certainly won't declare that the Pixar magic effect has worn off. On the other hand, the usual captivating animated short that precedes all Pixar films was not all that as far as I was concerned. 3 men cleaning the moon was more simplistic than average and had a ho-hum payoff. For me, the fast-paced short that appeared before ""Wall-E"" called ""Presto"" is one of the best.Kids will be fine with this film, and adults will not get too bored, but all you really have left is the striking visuals (sometimes).",6.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
1. All things Pixar. 2. Misleading Marketing. 3. Merida rocks!,"Let me say right off the bat that I thought this was a great film. Just like any other Pixar film, it kept me invested and it elicited a whole range of emotions and reactions from me. It looked wonderful, the characters were beautifully drawn and developed, it was hilarious without being cheesy, it was suspenseful when it needed to be, but it had its extremely sweet and touching moments.Nevertheless, I totally went in expecting a different movie; and I blame the movie's marketing for it! The trailers had me pumped for a darker, more mature and more epic story with higher stakes and more realistic consequences. Thinking back on it, I'm not sure why I fell into that trap. This was a Pixar movie after all - and Pixar wasn't about to make it's film inaccessible to kids!Let me explain why I was misled. I've watched every trailer for this movie, and after watching it, I must say that the trailers reveal information regarding only about the first 20 minutes of the film. We did know that there was some type of spell involved, but we were never told what it would do. My cousin and I had talked about this; and we had our guesses. And we were right. Not going to spoil it here; but that should have tipped me off that this was going to be a kid's movie.Many people will disagree that this is a kid's movie because there are some scenes that are legitimately too scary for kids. Hence the PG rating. I'm not talking about the scary sequences when I say this is a kid's movie. I'm talking about the logic; and this film follows a very kid-movie logic with kid-movie stakes and kid-movie consequences. That's not a bad thing at all. It's just that the trailers had set us up for something much more mature and more epic. The trailers focused so heavily on how Merida broke tradition, that I had really come to expect more focus on the consequences of that. And the movie does start out on a very mature note. But then at one point it starts to go down the kid- movie path, once you realize that the scale of the story is pretty small. No grand adventure where she scales mountains of 10th century Scotland and conquers her destiny like the trailers would have us believe. There was an adventure, yes, but of kid's movie proportions.I can't explain this in the context of Brave without spoilers. So I shall explain this in the context of Up (spoiler warning for Up). The first 15 minutes of Up had some of the best story-telling I had ever seen. It had a lot of gravity and a lot of depth; and then the fun adventure that followed - with houses floating away on balloons, and dogs that can voice their thoughts through a machine, scary dogs with chipmunk voices, and a cartoony villain - had a completely different tone to it. The first 15 minutes and the rest of the movie are like two different movies. You get tuned for something mature, but then you have to readjust your expectations really fast, because you realize Up isn't about an old man dealing with the emptiness in his heart as much as it is about a fun family-friendly adventure with a senior citizen, a little Asian kid, a dog and a giant bird. The same thing happens with Brave.I just wish they hadn't marketed it so much to an older audience. Mirror Mirror did the same thing. That movie should have just marketed itself to little girls instead of to teens, and then it wouldn't have received so much hate; because in my opinion, Mirror Mirror was a good film for little girls. It had a positive and empowering message as well.Brave fares much better than Mirror Mirror though just because it's Pixar. Pixar can always deliver a fun heartwarming tale (pretend that Cars 2 didn't happen). It was awesome in the way only a Pixar movie can be; and it had one of the best cast of characters I've seen. And Merida was honestly a rocking heroine. Her animation gorgeous - and not just her hair, but all of her movements were spectacular!Thankfully I was able to reorient my expectations in time to enjoy the lovely cinematography and heart warming tale; and so this movie gets a 10 on 10. But if you've heard people say that this will be one of Pixar's forgettable flicks, I can't totally disagree, and that will be because Pixar picked the wrong way to hype up this film. But Princess Merida, you keep rocking, girl! Pixar's first female protagonist definitely delivers!",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
"Brave is among Pixar's least best work, but it still is enjoyable","¨If you had a chance to change your fate, would you?¨Pixar has raised the bar so high in animated films that it seems unfair to go into a film with such high expectations, but I did with this movie. Brave isn't a bad film, but it really doesn't hold up to Pixar's greatest pictures like Up, Toy Story, Finding Nemo, or Ratatouille. It is visually amazing, but in an animated film I have come to expect a good story with interesting characters as well, along with a decent amount of comedy. Brave sometimes feels a bit serious, with not much really happening story wise. It is a gorgeous film to look at, but I 'm afraid the characters won't stick with me in the same way that other animated characters have done so. I don't know how much younger children will enjoy this movie, but it is a film that grown up kids and adults might enjoy. Brave is entertaining, and I have to admit that Pixar finally gave us a different kind of Disney princess this time. Merida loves archery and adventures; she isn't your typical princess that dreams of finding love or is patiently waiting for her prince to come rescue you. This was probably my favorite aspect of the film; having Pixar introduce us to a different kind of heroine: a brave one. On the negative side I find it pretty tiring that they continue to insist on this parent against kid confrontation, where you have one of the parents trying to impose their value on the kid, and the parents always end up looking like the bad guys. There were a lot of similarities between this movie and How to Train Your Dragon (a movie I really loved), although that movie was more gorgeous to look at and had much more memorable characters. Brave is a good film, it just isn't as great as the latest Pixar releases.Brave takes place in Scotland in a mythical time where four different clans all live in peace among each other. Fergus (Billy Connolly) is the leader of his clan, and he rules his people bravely alongside his wife, Queen Elinor (Emma Thompson). They have a daughter named Merida (Kelly Macdonald) who Elinor is preparing to be Queen one day. She must behave and act like a princess despite the fact that Merida prefers riding on her horse all day and having outdoor adventures with her bow. This difference between Merida and Elinor is what continually puts them against each other. When Merida finds out that her mother intends her to marry one of the firstborns of the other three clans she gets even more upset with her. Tradition stated that she must marry the firstborn of one of the clans in order to maintain the peace in the region so all three clans are coming to their land to fight for her love. One night Merida is so outraged that her mother never listens to her that she decides to run away from her home and comes across a witch who gives her a potion to change her mother. This way Merida believes she will finally be able to make her own decisions and her mother will accept her. What she doesn't know is that her actions will have terrible consequences and that peace among the clans will be at stake.The funniest characters in the film are the three younger brothers Merida has who are constantly being reckless. They provide the few comedic moments this animated film has. Otherwise I felt it played out more as a drama/adventure than a comedy. I really just got across watching this film after it received its Oscar nomination for Best Animated Feature Film and was a little disappointed with it, but perhaps I'm just getting too old for this stuff. I still have to see the other four nominees before I choose my favorite, but Wreck it Ralph looks interesting. The plot really got weird during the second half of the film, but I still enjoyed the movie overall although I won't be watching it again. I was a little disappointed with the story, but the visuals of the Scottish highlands were great. The film was directed by Mark Andrews after Brenda Chapman abandoned the project during the production stages. Andrews is mostly known for his short animated film: One Man Band which I loved. He didn't have that great of a story to work with, but Brave is still a slightly entertaining film just don't go into it with such high expectations.http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/",6.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
A subversive magic trick,"I think Pixar's last two films have perfectly replicated how bipolar and easily disappointed a studio's fans can be when they decide to go in a different direction or, the second they make something they aren't fond of, they immediately lose all hope in them ever bouncing back. Of course I'm talking about the immense hate Cars 2 got last year and how obvious skepticism rang during the coming weeks of Brave's theatrical run.Cars 2 is, in my opinion, the weakest Pixar movie, but it still managed to earn a positive review from me due to its entertaining setup, kinetic energy, entertaining characters, and clear inspiration from Lasseter and everyone involved. It was pleasant entertainment, but lacked the emotional drama and the subversive narrative that recurred in a Pixar spectacle, not to mention, completely abandoning the original film's beautifully mosaic nostalgia and heavy themes of change and adapting to a new way of life. All and all, while fun, we can see one of the direct motivations to make the sequel was the original Cars film, while churning the lowest profits theatrically and being the first Pixar film to not garner a critical consensus of ""positive,"" grossed $8 billion in merchandise, and by making a sequel, they could usher in a new line of toys while welcoming huge profits commercially.Now comes Brave, unfortunately victim to the pungent aftertaste Cars 2 left in many audiences' mouths. Had this come out when the company just began, say 1998, instead of A Bug's Life, when Pixar hadn't even begun showing audiences what they could do, perhaps it would've been viewed differently. The story is simple enough; Merida (voiced by Kelly Macdonald) is the teenage daughter of King Fergus (Billy Connolly) and Queen Elinor (Emma Thompson) who is required to become a princess thanks to her mother's strict, unforgiving rules and the outdated traditions of the Scottish land. Her mother plans an arranged marriage between her and another man, while neglecting the fact that her daughter has a whole other agenda she wants to pursue. An agenda that allows her to be a free-spirited archer, and a brave, fearless woman of power.Thirty minutes into Brave left me somewhat underwhelmed. The animation, as expected, was evoking and extravagant, but the storyline screamed Disney instead of Pixar. I felt little involvement with the film and its characters, little urgency, and little originality between scenes and found the slapstick humor encompassed way more of the film than it should be entitled to. Then, sometime during the second act it hit me...One must recognize first and foremost that while this will not be a subversive Pixar film like Toy Story, WALL-E, or Cars, but a fairy tale with compromising story devices from Disney and Pixar. Clearly, Disney's influence on the picture's look, story, and characters shines through more than Pixar's, but extracting the morals and the impact of this picture is what really gives us the idea that Pixar had more influence on the crafty, genuine themes and moral setups. To begin with, there is no love story, at all. You think there will be during the competition in the beginning to win Merida's hand in marriage, but it is quickly abandoned for good reasons.Secondly, we are spared the story of a young, directionless teenager who can't find out what to do with her life. The kicker here is we already know what Merida wants to do and she does to; be a more open, free-spirit, riding horseback, equipped with her trusty bow and arrow. While she is self-aware and confident, here problem lies with her mother's resistance to let her pursue such a dream and therefore, she is not roadblocked by indecisive life choices, but indecisive others.And finally, we see a beautiful portrayal of a mother-daughter relationship and how defying tradition is frightening at first, but a compromise between the two parties can be reached in some way. To hear people call the Merida character ""whiny"" and ""selfish"" pains me greatly. Put those people in Merida's shoes, where they are victim to a stubborn, controlling ideology, outdated traditions, and forced to do things that will not better them as a whole, and see what they'd rather do; stay confined or break free from the shackles of convention to be their own person.As stated before, the animation here is just gorgeous, with evocative shots of Scottish landscapes, thrilling scenes of horseback riding, and heavy emphasis on Merida's long, luscious red hair flowing in the wind as she races through the forests of her home. This could possibly be viewed as the least colorful Pixar film, considering it has more of a ""green, gray, and teal"" color scheme, where as every other Pixar film occupies a poster with colors of the rainbow. I, however, see no flaws with the look, style, or feel of this film and the fluency and liveliness between characters and dialog is commendable.Nonetheless, Brave, for now, will be the red-headed (no pun intended) stepchild of the Pixar family, unless in years down the line, when the company has surely made more groundbreakers, audiences and fanboys will look back at this and reminisce their foolish hatred for a film that is deeper and more narratively satisfying than many gave credit for. Can this be viewed as one of the weaker films by the renowned studio? Definitely; it is a bit more reliant on slapstick humor than the many other wonderful pictures, but the more I examine this picture, the more I realize that all of this material may be subversive after all.Voiced by: Kelly Macdonald, Billy Connolly, and Emma Thompson. Directed by: Mark Andrews and Brenda Chapman.",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Cool,"Brave is quite a good movie. It has great animation (good for 3D), awesome voice actors who got the accents just right and an okay meaning. But in general, it was just a touch too short and I didn't get a lot out of it, and personally, I think Pixar could have done A LOT better. It's not that Brave isn't a good movie, it's just that instead of being the usual ""Pixar great"", Brave was just well, ""good"". Because it was only like 98 minutes long, the film didn't have the important parts that makes some movie great like world building and the relationships between some characters. It just feels lacking in both plot and meaning. But in the end, Brave WAS a good movie so go and check it out if you haven't already and I hope you found this review helpful.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

Extremely enjoyable experience!,"Being big fans of animation, my wife and I always try to catch animated movies -especially those which are digitally so. Animated movies more so than most, tend to be ""hit or miss"" and with this one, Pixar has a definite 'HIT'. The story is engaging, the characters (even ancillary ones) are interesting, and there weren't any 'dead' spots where you wished things would just move along to the next scene. It was just plain fun. Most telling (in my view) is this: I cannot recall the last time I saw a movie and didn't see a lot of dimwits texting or playing with their phones. If you like animated movies that actually have a story (not just pretty flashes of color and loud noises) you will like this one.",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Brave:  Disney Mythology,"Almost everything ticks the boxes with Brave. Storyline, sub plots, 'messages', action sequences, character development, comedy moments, pace, casting and I saw it in 3-D which was great. I particularly liked the motif of the next generation trying to struggle towards some sort of understanding with the last, a universal developmental issue. There was some nice 'magical' stuff, always a hit with kids.The thing I found disturbing was that while all the male characters are gnarled, quirky or downright ugly, the two main female characters are the usual Disney girls - flawless skin, soft melodic voices, perfect, gorgeous big Manga-style eyes, Barbie figures, great hair.As role models for little girls at a time when we are supposed to be celebrating diversity and building self esteem by not constantly obsessing about appearances, especially for women, the characters' physical perfection seemed to be completely over the top. I really liked the character of the rebellious Princess, who had developed male skills like archery, riding, etc and represented feminism pretty well, even thought we all know that a real Scottish mediaeval Princess would have had no power and fewer rights.I guess Disney has to make a 'pretty' movie to suit its market, but does the appearance of the girls really have to be SO shallow?Overall though, a great, touching movie, I took my 7 year old grandson, he engaged pretty well with it so it does the job.",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Still entertaining...,"I give this film a 6/10. My judgement may be slightly critical, being a huge Pixar fan, though this film fell rather short of my expectations. I felt that it just didn't have the heartfelt Pixar magic put into it. Don't get me wrong it is a good movie, but for a Pixar movie it just lacked almost everything I love about Pixar. The thing Pixar does best and is most known for is creating memorable characters, and the character development in Brave was almost non- existent. Don't get me wrong, kids will enjoy this movie without a doubt, but for Pixar standards, much too formulaic and unoriginal in execution. After Cars 2, which is without dispute the worst Pixar movie to date, this one comes in at second to worst. The best part of the movie is the short La Luna which was pretty good. 8/10 for La Luna. I really hope Pixar can redeem themselves with their next feature film.",6.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Too much of fantasy,"Watching Brave felt like reading a story out of a fairy tale book. This movie had everything that belonged to a fairy-land. A princess, a King, a Queen, a witch with spells and potions, magic and a lesson for all the kids out there :-) And when there is a princess, there has to be a prince who would fall in love with her and take her away, but no, that's not how it is :-)Spoiler alert, beyond this point What I admired about the movie was that makers decided to move away from the usual theme of princess falling in love with a prince and made a different kind of theme, a family oriented movie. The movie revolves around rebellious teenage princess trying to break traditions and paving her own future. The Queen struggles to make her daughter the perfect princess who has a class and charisma of an ideal Queen.But I usually find flaws in these movie quite easily, they get very predictable after a certain time. The movie wasn't 'extremely-funny' or 'extremely-motivating' or had something that would leave the audience spell bound. I found the Ice-Age trailer to be more entertaining than this movie.My suggestion: If you like animated movies you will enjoy every bit of it. It's an OK-OK movie.",6.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
"Maybe Not What You'd Expect From Pixar,But Still A Great Original Movie With A Great Twist,","Brave is a great movie movie with a great storyline,cast characters,humor and action.It myth not be exactly the kind of movie that you would expect from Pixar,but I still thought it was great and better than other Pixar movies such as A Bugs Life,Cars,Ratatouille and Wall-E (not that I don't like these movies,there all great,Pixar is just brilliant).It was nice to see an original movie from Pixar,seeing that the last two years we had Toy Story 3 and Cars 2.Pixar have a really great future for films planned,with plenty of original projects but also plenty of sequels to previous successes planned,there future looks bright.A young adult named Merida is the oldest daughter of her parents,the king and queen of Scotland.They are trying to find a prince for Merida for the day she becomes the princess,however Merida is being pushed around by her mother,she is not interested in becoming princess and just wants her freedom,she finds a way to make this come true.",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
So yes women are smarter,"Brave on the surface seemed like a wonderful trip to the mythical land Scotland. And that's the biggest problem with the movie, it isn't. Instead we get dumb kings, whiny daughter and very little magic. On the positive side Meridoc is a great animated character. And let me just say that the animation was the standout. Horses that look like real horses, bears that look like bears. Back to the story, yes it was female centric but was it necessary to make the men so completely dumb. We should not have to dummy others up to up lift ourselves. Also this was just a repeat of the little mermaid without the romance. The witch was a cute addition but the story was weak and frankly a little scary for little ones. Just one more note the animated short that appears before the movie is priceless.

Imagine If Ariel was unsympathetic,"It is said that Walt Disney felt his films ""Alice in Wonderland"" and ""Peter Pan"" failed as a movie because it lacked 'warmth/heart'Honestly I think he would change his mind once he saw this movie.It is the teenage revenge fantasy of going to great lengths to avoid doing something you don't want to without any thought as to how it might effect other people. The plan falls flat on her face and pathetically tries to fix it after a state of denial. Feels sorry but gets lucky at the end and ends up with no consequences of her own and learns nothing.All under the influence of pride and ignorance. You really pity her not so much feel sorry/root for her.

The Bear and the Bow Has Been Released!,"Originally titled The Bear and the Bow, Brave is the latest Pixar movie. I had a lot of expectations for this movie, going into it. It was my most anticipated movie of the year. These are the criteria for a Pixar movie: 1. It needs to be funny for all ages. 2. It needs to have a good story. 3. It needs to have good characters. 4. It needs to have top-notch animation. 5. It needs to be heart-warming.Now let's see if Brave manages to meet with these criteria: 1. The movie's humor mostly consists of slapstick. If there's one thing we've learned from Looney Toons, it's that slapstick makes all ages laugh, from babies to old people. So Brave definitely succeeds in this aspect. While it mostly consists of physical humor (funny body language and people hitting each other in a funny way), it's still very funny. 2. Brave has a great story. It takes elements from past Disney movies, and puts them into one good fairy tale story with a good set-up, an unexpected plot twists and a happy ending. 3. The characters are a mixed bag. The family (the main character, her mother and father, and her little triplet brothers) are very good characters. The main character is one you want to vote for, the mother is a character you feel for but also disagree with (which is a great thing), the father is funny as hell and always makes you smile and the triplets are some of the greatest comic relief characters in Pixar (and maybe even Disney) history. But the rest of the characters aren't bad, but underdeveloped. But you don't mind them, in fact you want to see them on screen so you can know more about them. So Brave does succeed with the characters too. 4. Brave is definitely on my top 3 list of the best-looking animated movies of all time. Enough said. 5. While Brave doesn't reach the emotional standards that Up and Toy Story 3 have reached, it's still a sometimes tragic story that leaves you with a wonderful little finale.So the results are in (by the way, I think I'm gonna do this for every Pixar movie I review on IMDb): Criteria 1 = 7/10 Criteria 2 = 8/10 Criteria 3 = 7/10 Criteria 4 = 10/10 Criteria 5 = 8/10So overall, Brave is a worthy entry to the Pixar family, and ... wait here, I just have to do something real quick........ NO, CARS 2, YOU ARE NOT A RESPECTED FAMILY MEMBER, YOU CASH-CRAB! ....... OK, as I was saying: Brave is a great entry to the Pixar family and it seems that Pixar have returned to their glory.",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
The Vidiot Reviews...,"Brave  The hardest part of being brave is finding someone wide enough to stand  in front of you as you go and be valiant.  However, the maiden in this animated-adventure doesn't need a human  shield to be heroic; she has a bow.  Furious over her mother Queen Elinor's (Emma Thompson) choice to marry  her off to an allied clan, Merida (Kelly Macdonald) seeks a witch's  spell to prevent her from doing so.  Unfortunately the hex changes the Queen into a bear.  Worse, the transformation will remain if Merida doesn't make amends  with her mother before sundown.  Meanwhile, her father (Billy Connolly) prepares for battle with his  former friends.  While the animation's striking and the mother/daughter dynamic  commendable, the sorcery subplot is convoluted and detrimental to the  story.

"One of Pixar's weaker films, but still very good","After the critical disappointment that was Cars 2, people started to trash Pixar. They seem to have put the company on such a high pedestal, that one movie that wasn't a masterpiece was a sign that the company is never going to make a great movie again. Well I do love Pixar, and have absolutely loved several of their films, there are some movies that I just consider pretty good films that aren't masterpieces. The two Cars movies, Ratatouille, most of Up, and A Bug's Life, most of these were very good movies, but didn't reach amazing standards. And Brave lands in that category as well.The major issue with this movie is the fact that the story is pretty cliché and very predictable. I knew exactly how the story would end half way through the movie. At times it feels like it's ripping off other movies like ""How to Train Your Dragon"" and ""Brother Bear."" The three little boys range from funny to kind of annoying. There's some juvenile humor, but all Pixar movies have that, they have some juvenile humor for the kids, and some jokes for the adults that will go over the kid's heads. And there was a little too much comedy, it often outweighs the dramatic stuff.Which is kind of ashame, because the parts where the movie slows down and has some drama are some of the best parts. I liked the relationship between Merida and her mother, it was how a teenage daughter and her mother would act, despite being a bit cliché. The way the plot gets moving is something that you will either go along with, or it will kill the movie for you. I didn't mind this, I actually kind of enjoyed the way it moved the plot along. It led to some funny moments, and even a few heartwarming moments. I was never bored in the movie, most of the jokes worked, and the climax was enjoyable. But the best part was the animation, the first few seconds when it's just landscape actually made me ask ""is that real?"" And the animation on Merida's hair is outstanding, just as good as Repunzel's in ""Tangled."" So while ""Brave"" is one of Pixar's weaker movies, it's still a good one. The plot is predictable, but it has some really good characters and great animation, plus some good humor and a fun fantasy element. It's a great family movie, I would put it one step above ""A Bug's Life"" and one step below ""Ratatouille,"" not really one I will watch over and over, but a good film that you and your children should enjoy.",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Brave but not brave enough?,"Pixar have created a high bar for other studios to clear, equally they themselves now have to ensure that their output matches their own standard.""Brave"" is a deviation, a female protagonist not a buddy in sight and at it's heart, a mother daughter relationship movie.""Merida"" (Voice - Kelly McDonald of Boardwalk Empire fame) is the princess daughter of Lord Fergus (Billy Connolly - Voice) and Lady Elinor (Emma Thompson - voice), king and queen of a mythical Scottish rugged clan of fighters and farmers. Unfortunately, despite being carefully groomed in the ways of a lady, ""Merida"" with a shock of beautiful red flowing hair, is more content riding and hunting in the forest on her trusty stead clutching a bow and arrow.Tradition dictates that the head of the clans should provide a suitor by way of a tournament to decide who will win her hand. Most of the contenders are ""Braveheart"" rejects and being a modern free spirited girl, ""Merida"" is not so keen on this idea, resenting her life being pre-ordained, much to her mothers chagrin.Father is of course just happy to get drunk, recount bear killing stories and admire the leg he lost in the fight, a ""wee scratch"", in the Scottish way.The story takes a turn for the fantastical when ""Merida"" makes a wish with a wizened ole' witch of the woods (Julie Walters - Voice) after following will-o'-the-wisp, which is fair warning this would be a bad idea. Mother suddenly turns into a bear and all must be put right and wrapped up before sunrise on the third day, otherwise mum will be catching salmon at the local river for ever. Her three beautifully red headed wee triplet boys, forever with no mother to care for them.It almost goes without saying that the animation is superb and state of the art, hair, water, skin tones and foliage, created almost photo realistically. The casting is strong, Connolly, Robbie Coltrane and Thompson are almost a given in these roles and none of the voice talent lets the side down. Unusually for Pixar characters, they do occasionally burst into song and there is a feeling of ""Disneyfication"" about the whole project, a slightly worrying trend. We will however acknowledge the boy triplets transformed into tiny bears, are cute indeed.Will kids love it, yes of course. Bright colours, great chases and enough humour mixed into the keep the wee ankle biters engrossed and ready for bed afterwards.Parents however may feel short changed, usually nobody would accuse Pixar of being safe and boring but strangely, this is their most formulaic story yet, despite the female protagonist. The story does not always gel and there are occasions where the older viewers will be looking at the clock or their mobile phone.The film lacks a character to identify with and the offbeat story line does skew the story away from the norm into the realm of fairy tales, something Pixar have not made forays into before.Pixar do not make bad films and this pitches mid range, perhaps better than Cars 2 but falling well short of the classic films the studio is most loved for.An interesting experiment but lets hope the Disney suits do not take grab the iconic Pixar angle poised lamp and take the studio too far in the warm, fuzzy and bland direction.SummaryNot classic Pixar but a solid entry into the animated CGI children's movie canon and there is little to offend or upset the wee bairn's here.Skews younger than most Pixar releases but will be enjoyed by youngsters and parents who may be making dinner or multi-tasking at the same time.http://julesmoviereviews.blogspot.co.nz/",6.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
The most conventional animated film ever made. Might as well be called 'Mother Bear',"Brave was possibly my most anticipated film of the year, not because I thought it would be good, but I knew that watching it would be history in the making. This was Pixar's chance for them to redeem what they did with last years 'Cars 2', a very mediocre animated film. Have Pixar done that? In short, No.Brave is possibly the most conventional animated film ever made. The Plot is the same one seen in 'The Little Mermaid', 'Happy Feet', 'Kung Fu Panda', Parodied in 'Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs' and most similar 'How to Train Your Dragon', about parents who don't let their kids be what they want to be, and have to learn how they have been wrong in this regard. There is also similarities to 'Brother Bear', which are quite obvious.Brave's positives come from it's grand visual style, typically pixar, and the fact that it takes itself seriously and has a structured narrative and characters. This gives it the 6 points by itself, but the 4 are lost through a variety of things.The comic relief seems tact on and incredibly unfunny. The way the story tries to get the plot moving is silly. The conflict is way too co-incidental and forced. There's also a subplot about the tribes of the land and how bad it is that they are fighting, which really doesn't make sense when you see that they seem like they are just having fun.The greatest disappointment is the fact that the magic this movie promises is weak, and it feels like we've seen it all before.",5.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Visually stunning but no soul,"A long time ago I told some friends that if a movie has John Laseters name on it (one of the founders of Pixar, now rad of Disney animation) that the movie couldn't be that bad. I hate to say or but Pixars last two attempts have proved me wrong. They have moved away from the mantra of the story making the film what it is and relied too heavy on the visual design of the film. Don't get me wrong Brave is a true piece of art visually, but it lacks the true heart and soul of films like Up and Wall-e. I just felt like I was being force fed Disney princess garbage again (a recent trip to the supermarket proves this as the entire toy aisle was Brave merchandise). To sum it up this film is a visual wonder with a terrific setting and soundtrack, but the plot is absolutely a Disney princess reboot a la Hanna Montanna.",6.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
"Brave - A stunningly beautiful, if albeit a tad predictable, adventure for the whole family","Brave tells the tale of Merida, a Scottish princess who is wrestling against her impending fate to be married as hard as she's wrestling with her mother, Elinor. Merida would much rather be wandering the country-side and practicing archery while riding her horse, Angus, than being tied up in corsets and presented to suitors. One day, after a particularly nasty fight with her mother, Merida stumbles upon a witches hut in the woods. Together they strike a deal to make a spell for Merida to change her fate, and well, things get a wee bit complicated.Merida marks PIXAR's first addition to the Disney princess pantheon. Time will tell how she resonates with that audience, but I think she's a worthy addition. Merida, as well as the rest of the cast, are beautifully animated and rendered, but not quite PIXAR's finest. It's kind of hard to judge them this way, since the company's forte has really been creating anthropomorphic characters. But The Incredibles managed to create some very interesting looking human characters and Brave's come up just a little short by comparison. Merida and her mother are really the center stage characters though, and their relationship is well crafted and engrossing. The real visual treats are the environments and the scenery. The natural beauty of Scotland really shines through the animator's use of the areas lush forests and greenery. The scenes with Merida just riding through the woods or climbing a hill are absolutely spectacular.Of special note is the soundtrack, which is beautiful on all accounts. The violin, fiddles, flutes, and bagpipes are melded together by Patrick Doyle to create something almost transformative. I've always been a fan of traditional Scottish music for its ability to paint a vivid and mystical picture with some very unique sounds, and Doyle's score is no exception. When mixed with the mountains and the rivers and the majesty of Scotland, the combination is extraordinarily breathtaking.Unfortunately, the same cannot be said about the story, which gets a little mundane by around the halfway point. It's not boring by any means, but it does begin to feel a little standard. It's about the point that Merida meets the witch that things become a little derivative, but this is really only so evident because the beginning of the movie is so good. While not a backwards slide in narrative at this point, it is a bit of a plateau that holds steady until the end. Brave is still a great cautionary tale for young women (and their mothers too) about riding the fine line of making your own way, but doing it without trampling on the people that got you where you are. It's just going to feel more than a little familiar in the end.Don't get me wrong though. Brave is an excellent movie and I'd highly recommend it to the old and the young alike. We'll certainly be seeing it again at sometime, and will definitely own it when it's released for home viewing. Something can be found in Brave to entertain the whole family, and that is really where PIXAR shines. They don't pander to either the kids or the parents, and instead set out to make a real film with mature themes, that are boiled down in essence for everyone to understand. The result is always a mix that resonates well with everyone. Brave's problem is that it's only great compared to extraordinary. PIXAR has really spoiled us with the quality of their products since Toy Story all those years ago. But at the end of the day, a second rate PIXAR movie is still better than the majority of other features produced by the Hollywood system, and that's a pretty good position to be in.Follow me on Twitter @Mrhuffsmyfather for more movie reviews!",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Brave,"One of the Pixar movies that still to this day flies under the radar. And there's reason for it, but it also doesn't mean that this isn't still a fine movie. It really felt good for the first 20 or so minutes, and the finale. But most of the stuff in between has a real tendency to drag and just not be that engaging.I love the setting, theme and genuine accents being used here. It gives a authenticity to the world you don't see much in other Pixar movies. Though it comes at the cost sometimes of not fully hearing what people say, at least if you watch it without subtitles. That said it's a Pixar movie, a simple one at that, the bond between mother and daughter.The voice acting was great and the animation was pretty good overall, but in general the movie felt quite tame for and never really got that exciting vibe going on. Second is the story, now the emotional angle with the mother and daughter works simply put, Pixar always manages to get me to tear up at some point because they just nail the whole emotional human angle. That said the concept is quite simple, daughter that rebels against being like her mother. The story just felt a bit weak and I think the bear transformation and following scenes just never really did it for me, maybe it's the bear design itself or something but it just didn't latch on.Music is pretty great, always nice to hear those bagpipes combined with a melody. The movie doesn't really have a particularly memorable tune that sticks, most of it sounds nice, but it's very much just flute, bagpipes and a melody that feels somewhat generic ''adventure'' themed.Character designs is great, love the main character, just wished she had more action, maybe the movie insinuates that she's really going to go wild and be Brave, but the movie isn't really about that. And therefore also kind of went against my expectations. From the poster and title alone I thought she was going to run away from home and find herself through tough learnings of the sort, but no. We get a much more isolated story that mostly takes place in the castle and some forest.That might also be a bit of an angle, that the environments and locations we go to, or rather the lack of them adds a bit to the mundane nature of the movie and makes it much less of an adventure. World design here just felt very grounded. I wished they leaned more into the spirits and gods, and made it a bit more magical.Overall it's fine as a movie, for Pixar it's passable.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
"""If you had the chance to change your fate, would you?""","Princess Merida (Kelly Macdonald) doesn't want to be a princess. She wants to be free and fire arrows into the sunset, but most importantly, change her fate. When she stumbles upon a witch's hut in the woods, The Witch (Julie Walters) gives her a potion to which Merida thinks will change her mother, Elinor (Emma Thompson)'s mind about Merida getting married. The potion does more than Merida asked for. PIXAR is the best animation studio right now but last year the put out Cars 2 which I didn't like and found it a huge disappointment, being a big fan of Cars. I think they redeemed themselves with Brave and the short that shows before the feature, La Luna. Brave has great voice-overs and fantastic Scottish-accents. I didn't find the accents annoying and I don't think they got in the way of the viewing experience although others might disagree. I thought the voice- overs were great. The animation was spectacular as it always is with PIXAR. You can really see the facial expressions well so the viewer can interpret the character's feelings without them talking. The animation was just awesome. I give Brave a B+. For more reviews, go to www.thecheapseatsmoviereviews.weebly.com",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
A Brave effort,"Brave is about Merida, a Scottish princess who doesn't want to get married so badly that she turns to witchcraft to get out of it.Here's the thing about Brave. It is very much a one-time go sort of movie. If I had no idea what was happening, it would be great. The best part of this movie occurs half way through. And the plot advances at a snails pace to get it there. I don't like using the term boring, as I think interest is subjective. But looking at it as objectively as I can, waiting nearly an hour for something to happen is boring. I was constantly checking the time bar. As soon as we got there, it got going well. It was funny, unpredictable, sad and fast paced.However, Brave suffers for another reason. Pixar had been criticised for their lack of female protagonists and this is their response. We see this happen in a couple of movies. They try to show that girls have power too. Not that it isn't true, it is. But it overwhelms the movie. The fact of the matter is that in this time period women did have little control over their lives. I don't think this is the direction they needed to go in order to show this message.Finally, they try to make Merida a quirky and relatable character. And I totally understand why? However something about a girl with a bow and an arrow feels predictable and cliché to me. It has picked up off the Hunger Games buzz and although Brave doesn't suffer because of this, it does make the whole archery scene feel overdone.Overall, worth watching. It is good. I think it could be better. It is very much harkening back to the Disney princess days and I enjoyed that.",6.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
"Not in the same depth as Pixar's previous films, but a touching and entertaining movie","After Pixar released their first critical failure, Cars 2, they tried to do another ground-breaker which would hopefully be a classic to die-hard Pixar fans by making their very first fairy tale known as Brave and it's their very first Pixar film to feature a female protagonist. Now, I know what all of you are thinking. ""Oh, this is a girls movie, why did you went to see it despite the fact that you're a boy?"" Well, since I'm a hardcore animation fan, I would watch any kind of animated film that is gender-related, not animal animated films that I've seen the past few years.So, what do I think about this film? Well, I will say that while it's not in the same depth as Toy Story, Finding Nemo or some of Pixar's previous films, this is a very entertaining film like any other animated movie should be except the ones that are completely horrible (That's right. I'm looking at you, Secret of Nimh 2. You too, The Magic Voyage).Sure the story uses elements from Disney's The Little Mermaid and Brother Bear and the pacing dragged the entire movie too fast, but those flaws are overshadowed by it's beautiful animation (even the look of the main character Princess Merida's hair was so realistic), a great voice cast with the help of Kelly McDonald, Emma Thompson, Billy Connolly, Robbie Coltrane, and Craig Ferguson, and it's smart and witty script.The characters are likable especially Princess Merida and I liked the way she shoots some arrows and sword-fights. How awesome is that? Anyway, her mother, Queen Elinor, her father, King Fergus, and the three clans are likable too. Even the interactions between Merida and Elinor are enjoyable, but not only that. They're heartwarming and tear-jerking (especially near the end of the movie) There are some dark moments that would frighten younger kids, but I think that the parts with the monstrous bear scared the living heck out of me. The strongest aspects goes to the magnificent storytelling, it's hilarious moments with the triplet brothers (they're likable too), and the lovely music score from Patrick Doyle and I liked the songs ""Touch The Sky"" ""Into The Open Air"" and ""Learn Me Right"".Overall, not as excellent as Pixar's previous films, but a touching and entertaining movie worth watching. Thumbs up!",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Better,"I had a love/hate relationship with this movie for multiple reasons. The entire plot itself was focused on one thing (which is how it should be just let me finish) and it made the whole film feel like a compressed little world in a tiny box. It felt very much like a step 1 through 5 kind of movie, where it would just get one portion of the story done and then move on to the next with no breathing room except for a few gags to make the audience ""aw"" or laugh at. The relationship between the daughter and mother was pretty emotionally abusive and even with this being a Disney kids movie, how they quickly fixed their relationship over the course of two days was very unrealistic and rushed.HOWEVER this film still has a place in my heart for one of my favorite movies of all time. The visuals were great, the horror element of a giant, century old bear with spears in him was adrenaline inducing, and the relatable relationship between the entire royal family felt personally relatable. This is a movie I can watch every now and then but not a few times a week because of how simple and straightforward the whole story was. I wouldn't tell you that you absolutely need to watch it, but if you're tired of all the sequels and prequels Disney is making these days, I'd definitely give it a watch for something fresh or nostalgic.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Sadly homogenized,"I dunno what to make of ""Brave"". It says PIXAR before the title, but this is very much a Disney movie, from the gags and rhythms right down to the cutesy tone. I think that's the biggest thing; it's just kinda generic. Which is disappointing because it's set in the underused Scotland (and features some really picturesque locales). But mostly, it's the weak story, and it feels surprisingly long for 90 minutes. There was some great buildup with Merida's archery, but no payoff for such an independent female warrior.It started out with promise, but falls right in line with ""Tangled"" and ""Frozen"" product.5/10",5.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Strike 2.,"After the panned ""Cars 2"", Pixar hoped to get back on base with the 6- year-in-the-making ""Brave"" - unfortunately it will have to wait for the next pitch. Certainly, not a bad film but one that relies less on the visual fireworks ""Wall-E"" or crackling inside jokes (""Monsters, Inc) of previous Pixar films and more on sheer plot. Unfortunately, the plot they choose centers around feminist empowerment that would have felt dated had the premiere been in 1983. In fact, the writer Brenda Chapman wholesale lifted the plot from Marlo Thomas' 1972 record album ""Free to be You and Me"" padding it with some magical elements later on in the film. Unfortunately, the characters don't step in and save the plot. The royal family including Merida are types more than characters, the triplets are more background than characters, and the bad guys are all menace and hair. And what's with the love/hate relationship movie-goers have with bears anyway? For every Yogi, there's a ""The Edge"" - if the film doesn't teach us tolerance for girls, at least it might help out acceptance of bears. In short, re-rent ""Wall-E"" the height of what might just turn out to be Pixar's bygone glory days.",,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Brave...3 out of 4 Skittles,"Brave is charming, funny, heart-warming and filled with excitement. Everything we've come to expect from a Pixar animated film. Built on their reputation from past classics Toy Story, Finding Nemo, Wall-E and Up, Pixar continues to prove that when it comes to great animated family filmsthere's Pixar.and then there's everyone else.Kelly Macdonald (Boardwalk Empire, No Country For Old Men) brings the lead character Merida to life with such likability and honesty that you tend to forget she is generated by a computer. Emma Thompson (Nanny McPhee, Men In Black 3) and Billy Connolly (The Last Samurai, The Boondock Saints) round out the lead voice characters providing a warm and truthful environment that help paint a portrait of realism and showcase why Merida is the young woman she's become.I can't rate Brave at the top of the modern masterpiece class with the likes of Up and Wall-E, but it is very good and definitely lives up to the Pixar standard. It's a family film that the entire family will actually enjoy.

Well made particularly the way the ending was handled,"(2012) Brave
COMPUTER ANIMATION FAMILYFrom looking at the poster, it may seem deceiving for I initially thought it was about a red-haired girl on some great adventure or quest, to save a sibling or a prince but upon actually watching it, it's about an outcast princess of a Scottish clan who's not ready to marry, but has to because it's a tradition and it's customary. And upon going on a hissy fit with her mother, she then goes off to the forest to come across an old witch who requests for a specific potion. And to say anymore would ruin the surprise. Quite hard to adapt at first since some of it's already been done before, but as a result of making the most of it's animation- mostly out of the three ""boys"" may have kept this film from being cliché as a whole, I still thought it was well made particularly the way the ending was handled.",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
One of the better Pixar films,"I remember seeing this movie back in 2012 and enjoying all the fantastic scenery as well as the Scottish themes. It's not the best animated film I've seen but it's a nice runner-up to my favorites. While watching the movie, I was reminded of two previous Disney films. One was Freaky Friday and the other was 1991's Beauty and the Beast (but no romance!). I don't remember too much about the film, considering I've only seen it once, but it's one of the less cliched Disney princess movies. Plus, the heroine is an archer with a brave heart (no pun intended towards the Mel Gibson movie). There are some darker themes in this Pixar outing so it might not be good for very young children, but it would be interesting for teens and twentyish adults, or anyone who wants to see a Scottish setting. This movie really broke tradition for Pixar. And it worked.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Mess of an idea,"I remember the trailers for this movie. It looked like the story of a girl bucking all the traditional customs and stereotypes by saying no to pre-arranged marriage, not being prim and proper, as well as being different from everyone else is beautiful. What it turned out to be was a mess of a fight between the girl and her mom with some bizarre magic thrown in. This came so far out of left field that the movie was probably 2/3 over before I understood what the actual storyline was. I didn't like this direction, it felt like they took a character who could have been strong and confident in herself right from the beginning, and turned her into a whiny, teenage brat. I didn't think the connection between mother and daughter was heartfelt or genuine at all. The connection to her father was at least believable in that he had old school beliefs versus her brat whining. The twins were annoying. And the animation was... Lost in all the bizarreness in the story. Plus it seemed like it was someone's goal to make as many different body shapes as possible and that put me off too. I've only watched this once, will never again and I have never shown it to my kids.",3.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
I was disappointed,"I was ready for a Disney-dose of girl-power but was let down. I read that the director abandoned-ship halfway through the production and it shows.The movie starts out promising then it flounders. They forgot to finish writing the second half of the plot.Eventually the protagonist ""realizes"" that refusing to be forced to marry some stranger is just her being ""selfish"" and ""spoiled"". (What the heck?) In the end the mother suddenly changes her mind about forcing her daughter to marry. What goes on in the middle of the movie seems to have nothing to do with actually resolving the interpersonal conflict.The third act of the movie is kind of dull and consists of contrived slapstick action. I call it contrived because it revolves around trying to hide the mother while the protagonist tries to accomplish something, but why did the mother have to even come along? She could have just stayed somewhere safe while the heroine did her thing.",,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Funny....,"This time Walt Disney takes a comic approach mixed with some fairy tale and dramatic elements, and the result is quite an engaging and entertaining tale that keeps you glued as long as it lasts. The animation is much crisper and with the promos, the film looked very promising and elegant. Well, the film does carry some charm and might be liked by children; but the story is quite weak this time which meanders into some forgettable Disney movies of the past like ""Brother Bear."" The dialogues lack the punches of ""Tangled"" and ""Up."" But nevertheless, the film makes a joyous watch.

"Had no expectations walking in, satisfied walking out","I really had no idea what this movie was about except it was made by pixar. I went in and it really didn't blow me away like other animated films such as tangled with the script but it was very good in its own way. It has a completely different sense of humour to other Disney films and quiet frankly I liked certain parts of it. Just a problem I noticed was they were trying to appeal the movie to both adults and kids and thats one thing I didn't really enjoy. Some scenes would be hilarious, but some scenes were just plain stupid and purely for kids entertainment. I wasn't surprised since it was a Disney film but it really did take me out of the experience of the seriousness of the film. But besides all that the emotions you experience while watching the film is awesome. I love films that make put you in the scenes and make you feel like you have a bond with the main character and feel the emotions they are feeling. Just before my conclusion I also want to compliment the animation, it was top notch, perfecto ;) So in conclusion with the awesome cgi, the decent script, the jokes that appealed to me half the time and the movie making me emotional in parts I give it a 7.5, so ill round it up to 8 ;)",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

A different kind of fairytale; progressive and emotional.,"'Brave (2012)' is a different kind of fairytale, one with a progressive princess and a folk-tale feel which both truly set it apart from most others in its genre. It succeeds the most in genuinely feeling like one of the fables talked about within its own narrative: a short and simple story told because it has the power to entertain, enlighten and even emotionally affect, while also having somewhat of a basis in truth. There are several machinations of the plot that don't quite pull together, though, and, in general, the story rushes by so quickly that it's hard to actually believe any of its in-world impact. However, there's actually some real tension in the third act and the climax is surprisingly moving. The central relationship is, for the most part, a believable and nuanced one, too. Finally, the feature makes a point of having strong female characters who aren't reduced to over-the-top caricatures of what some board-room executive imagines a 'badass' woman to be. 6/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

Now, after some hours, i think i've got an idea about what is missing - the story is too didactic. By ""didactic"" I mean that story generally was not moved by heroine's choices, but by a mistake she once made. Like Robinson Crusoe's destiny was generally defined by his decision to leave father's house against his will. And every mistake is punished by fate. The crime and punishment theme is the one that creates heavy feeling in the movie, i think.

Into the Woods,"The latest Pixar film is surprisingly original and fun to watch. Unlike last year's sort of dud of Cars 2, this film has an interesting, fun, and mystical story that keeps the viewers entertained. Not only is Brave a lot of fun to watch, but it is also deep, meaningful, and touching.Young Merida is the princess of a kingdom in medieval Scotland, and a complete tomboy. She is the older sister of a set of mischievous, triplet brothers, she uses a bow and arrow better than most warriors, and she doesn't get along with her mother. The queen wants her daughter to act like a lady, and eventually decides to bring the other three kingdoms over, with the intention of marrying Merida off. However, the spunky red-haired daughter decides to visit a witch and change her fate. Of course this causes problems, and Merida must go on a journey of sorts to save her family.The plot structure is at times predictable, but that doesn't mean the film isn't original. The characters are all likable, funny, and complex. And the old fashioned fairy tale aspect is more than welcome. Many movies that have come out recently rely too much on the ""re-imagining"" of fairy tales and stories, but this one plays it straight, and benefits enormously from it. The woods outside the castle are filled with bears, witches, ancient structures, and spirits.The computer animated world is beautiful to look at, with rolling hills and a dark, ominous forest. The world is completely immersive; there is never a visual that seems out of place or unbelievable. Even the characters seem more detailed than in any previous Pixar film, most notably Merida's long, curly red hair, which is wonderful to look at.The film has some problems, including a few songs that play over montages, which are unnecessary and unwanted, and the third act almost becomes too predictable and tired, but by the end, the story picks itself back up again. Perhaps the sometimes awkward moments are a result of Brenda Chapman being fired from directing the film, and it being finished by Mark Andrews. Also, the film could have benefited from delving deeper into the mythology of creatures that live in the forest. The will-o-whisps are fine, but it would have been nice to have something a little more. Still, the film is a fun blockbuster that knows how to tell a good story, which is all I ask.http://thatguythatlikesmovies.blogspot.com/",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

Pixar Still Amazes Me,"Unlike my mom, I enjoyed this Disney Pixar movie just like I have the others.

I do agree with what my mom said about its short length, but I liked it. I was amazed that there were still a lot of people, mostly families with their little kids, that came to see it.

The human characters are all individual and the lip movement for the dialogue is well done. The plot is original and sweet, very funny and heartwarming. It's a lovely story and I love the Scottish backdrop and traditions. It's tense too with suspense and lots of action. The Highland Games were great and there's lots of physical comedy to enjoy. It has reminiscence of some of the older Disney's ie The Sword in the Stone and like other Disney films there's something for children and much that is definitely adult ie Maudie's bosom and the naked behinds of the clansmen when they've used their kilts as a rope to get down off the roof of the castle. Hilarious.The use of the Druidic standing stones in the story was beautiful and the soundtrack was lovely. Well researched film. Loved it. Like a lot of Disney/Pixar films it might not be suitable for very little ones as some of the scenes with the bears might be a little scary.

Great movie but there is something missing but what??,"Disney and Pixar really make great movies and here is an another-- ""Brave'.It is a good animated comedy that carries a message for everyone.Animation,effects,music and especially voice role are very cool.Brave is a great film with a different story and a unique message of bravery and it proves that man is the architect of his own fate.But there is something missing in Brave that we did not found in Up,Toy story and Finding Nemo. The story could have been more creative and the title should shave uncovered some more of it(bravery).But don't mind that.Check it out.It's riveting.Kelly Macdonald has really done a great job and the bear stuff is quite hilarious.Not only good for little kids but it will impress the youths too..Mark Andrews and Brenda Chapman have did it.Keep it up!!",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Review - Brave,"My Rating: ***1/2 (out of ****)Over its years, Pixar has brought its magic of high quality animation and good storytelling to the screen. Some of their films are better than others, but I've at least liked, or even loved, all of their films to date. I even found Cars 2 to be okay, even though it's my least favorite Pixar film. This summer I went to theater to see Brave, Pixar's thirteenth major feature film. I was a bit worried due to a lot of the negative criticism surrounding the film, but I ended up enjoying it. I also saw it again recently on DVD. I've already written a review for this film, but I've decided to re-write it now that I've had a couple additional viewings of the film.Brave is the story of Merida, a young red-haired princess and aspiring archer who is unhappy with her controlled and restricted life. When she is asked by her mother, Queen Elinor, to choose between three possible suitors from three other clans, she is even more upset, and, after a spat with her mother, she eventually flees into the woods, and soon comes upon a cottage (led there by magical blue willo-the-wisps), where she meets a witch. She begs for a magic spell to change her mother's mind, but it doesn't exactly go according to how Merida wants it...and problems ensue...I was a bit worried that I would like the movie on DVD less than I did on the big screen, but I ended up enjoying it just as much as I did before, and I still stand by my three-and-a-half (out of four) star rating. Brave is not without problems, but I can tell that the filmmakers really put in a good amount of effort to try and make the film work for what it's worth. The film's flaws are mostly forgivable and, while they do hold the film back from living up to its potential, they do not spoil the film.The story is not original or creative, and it's somewhat clichéd and predictable in areas. But the film does contain a lot of uniqueness, both visually and story-wise. What I liked most about the film was Merida herself, whom I found to be an interesting, complex, and charismatic character. She may be a princess, and yes, in a Disney movie, but she's not your average Disney princess. She's not the kind of princess who falls in love with a prince on a white steed. She is spunky, strong-willed, and independent, and she has bright, wild red hair that matches her personality. I fell in love with her, and I genuinely cared about her and even related to her a bit, and I stuck with her and got emotionally involved throughout the film. I even thought she was cute in terms of physical appearance, especially her hair. And Kelly MacDonald further helps to bring this feisty lass to life with a great voice performance with a cute Scottish accent.I enjoyed the dynamic relationship between her and her mother, and the bonding they undergo. Again, this is not a romance film. Instead, it concerns more personal and more relatable themes (in my opinion); family values and relationships, personal decisions, controlling one's own fate (deciding your own path in life), admitting one's mistakes, and some other valuable and life lessons. I especially liked the mother-daughter aspect. I myself am a 20 year old guy, but I still related to Merida and her relationship with her mother. While it may not be a romance film, it's definitely a film about love.The animation in this film is stunningly beautiful and helps bring the film to life. The Scottish landscape, the characters, Merida's hair, the wisps, and everything else in the film is all excellently animated. Sound-wise the film is very good too, both music and other effects. Composer Patrick Doyle, who was responsible for the score in Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, composed a great score for this film. I think the film could have used some more (and better) humor, but it did have its humorous moments as it is. It also handles its more emotional areas well, if you ask me.I feel that there are some things in the film that are meant to be felt rather than explained, and a few of these are meant to be a bit mysterious and open-ended. The film somewhat succeeds at these, but unfortunately it stumbles a bit here. I feel that the filmmakers overreached a bit in these areas. As a result some of these things didn't have the full effect they were supposed to have, and some of them felt a bit out of place. Yes, the movie felt a bit uneven and unpolished in some areas, and even bit compressed and rushed in a few.I honestly think the film could have benefited from a longer running length, with which the film could have improved some things, including, but not limited to, fleshing out the characters more, explaining some things better, and polishing up some plot elements. Also, it would have allowed the mysterious and open-ended feeling be established properly, with an appropriate balance between the things that are explained and those that are meant to be felt. Another criticism (more minor, though) I have is that the film could have used a bit more thought towards character development; the characters are all effective, and some of them memorable (especially Merida), but except for Merida and Elinor, the characters are a bit underdeveloped.However, despite these shortcomings, and a few more, I enjoyed the movie; I thought it was handled pretty well, even the weaker areas. Brave is a bit flawed, and it's definitely not Pixar's best, but I found it be a good movie overall; it's cute, charming, heartwarming, funny in areas, visually stunning, and undeserving of the negativity it receives.",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
"A beautiful, entertaining film from Pixar studios","Brave follows young Merida as she rebels against her parents wishes for her to marry, she meets a witch who casts a spell on Merida's mother, now she must race to find a cure.Brave is gorgeously animated, Pixar definitely stepped up there editing here.
The supporting characters are very funny, though you may feel like they need more screen time.

Brave in a nutshell,"The film Brave is definitely a must see in my opinion. It has plenty of ""chuckle"" heartwarmingly funny moments, as well as some innocently ""vulgur"" humor, though these so-called vulgar moments don't compromise the PG rating in anyway. At points, the film has some VERY emotional moments, which I'm not afraid to admit, made me shed a few tears, And if your curious, Im 26 years old, and a man. Yeah, it was that heart wrenching... The depth, charisma, and intricacies of the voice acting alone places this among the greatest that Disney has presented in the past. Above all however, was the animation. This is somewhat personal (because I find red haired woman breath-taking), but the animated facial expressions, timing, detail, texture, and the contrast was the icing, cherry, and hot fudge on the ""cake"".

Charming but not all it could be,"To start this review I'm going to say watch ""Tangled"" if you haven't already done so. That's what this film should have been.I am a little biased as I lived in Scotland for a number of years and still can't understand how the Scots can embrace historically inaccurate ""Braveheart"" with the Scottish hero played by an Americanised Australian. That being said I'm sure that they'll embrace ""Brave"". This film hits nearly every Scottish stereotype... well the ones that are reasonably family friendly. The film does have a good dose of Scottish voice talent, even if many of them haven't been home in a while.I'm happy to see The Big Yin (Billy Connolly) as part of the cast, but bitterly disappointed that they seem to have failed to adapt the character to Billy at all. The result being a somewhat lacklustre character that misses the mark.The female heroine is a firm cliché now but this is still a heart warming film. Unfortunately the two really funny characters (the Raven and the Witch's Broom) have very short scenes. The triplets are also devilishly amusing but again don't have enough screen time. The soundtrack is very typical airy/new age/folk music and is very well performed, but to me it sounds more Irish than Scottish. I think the soundtrack could definitely have used some more modern punch to it (Britney or Christina style). And the soundtrack seems contradictory to the film's main themes of being a ground breaking heroine and teenage rebellion.I watched the trailers in 3D but missed seeing the film in 3D. The 3D looked good, but I don't think that they made much effort to do a proper 2D version. It would appear that they've simply taken one field of the 3D rather than re-rendering it for 2D.Overall it's good family fun, but I don't see anyone compulsively rewatching this film.",6.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
All predictable,"I love story about princess that have courage and not too ""feminim"" but I give 6 of 10 because I'm little bit disappointed. I can guess the end of the story. All predictable. And story about the courage and the ability of Merida herself not shown properly. I think this story can go further more. Going deep and maybe attach a little bit darker side. Will be nice if the past was shown all, not just a piece of it. The adventure, I think, can be better, can be longer and full of meaning story not just the journey. But the idea and the intense of the story,I admit it, pretty nice. So, if you have a trouble with your mother, you should watch this movie.",6.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
"Some will see 'Brave' as a ""lesser"" Pixar film, but it's an undeserving label","Disney is no stranger to the fairy tale (understatement of the last century), but princesses, curses and kingdoms are definitely new forays for its partner, digital animation powerhouse, Pixar. John Lasseter and company have always been more preoccupied with breathing life into inanimate objects and giving vocal cords to animals, so a film with humans taking place in the Scottish highlands and only lightly sprinkled with magic, is starkly traditional by comparison.For a studio so pristinely viewed by the masses as the cutting edge of animated storytelling to retreat to one of the world's most ancient forms of storytelling might seem a bit confusing and maybe even disappointing, but Pixar does all that it does so well with ""Brave,"" even if the means and the ends are all too familiar.Firstly, Merida (voiced by Kelly Macdonald) would put all the classic Disney Princesses to shame. If they all gathered in the same room, she would stand out with her frizzled red hair and generally antsy disposition, not to mention think them all lame and boring for being dainty and predictable.Although the princess who would rather shoot arrows and run around outside all day than learn how to sit and speak properly is far from an original thought (these days you might consider her a cross between Katniss Everdeen and Arya Stark), Disney desperately needed a heroine who is self-sufficient and strong enough not to need a male co-star and Merida is perfect in that regard. She's not merely rebellious for the sake of the story, but you truly feel as if her character is not fit for a life of royalty.The movie follows a predictable path but a likable one, likable in its familiarity and likable because the issues and themes it speaks to are timeless. The core of the story is Merida's relationship with her mother, Queen Elinor (Emma Thompson). As it comes time for the lords of the three tribes to champion their sons for Merida's hand, the strain in their relationship boils over. Elinor tries maddeningly to make Merida understand her duties as princess, but Merida grows frustrated with her mother's lack of consideration for her own wishes.After an awful fight, Merida flees to the forest and follows the will-o'-the-wisps, desperate to change her fate by changing her mother's mind. After a strange witch presents her with that chance, Merida makes an impetuous choice that has major consequences and challenges her to see just how brave she can be.Merida is also a terrific heroine because she's not perfect. The Queen is not some evil stepmother, so while we understand Merida's feelings, we are frustrated with some of her initial choices. Regardless, you root for her the entire time and she successfully carries the weight of the story on her back.The male characters leave a little something to be desired, though the king, Fergus (Billy Connolly), is a lovable character and father. While he has plenty of foolish moments, he's also responsible and kingly when it's required of him. The lords from the rest of the kingdom are amusing but wild and one-dimensional until the end when Merida convinces them of one of the most obvious notions in human history.Related to the male characters in the film, the level of needless violence in ""Brave"" is surprising, though used for comic effect. Even the old witch, who's in the film for not even 10 minutes, beats her pet crow for no good reason. ""The Incredibles"" aside, Pixar has not traditionally been known for violence, and one could make the case that ""Brave"" is a bit scarier than most family-focused offerings.The humor of ""Brave"" goes beyond physical gags, however, though not into seriously laugh- out-loud territory. ""Brave"" is clever in the way you've come to expect from Pixar, by using truth, heart and goofy supporting characters. The three triplets are the comic highlight of the film to be sure.And heart is where ""Brave"" wins points for Pixar yet again. The commitment to storytelling, even if we're talking basic fairy tale outline with this film in particular, results in plenty of emotional catharsis. Mothers and daughters should particularly be moved by the outcome and moral of this one. Once again, no revelations in terms of the take-home message, but it's such a relief when Merida finally has her epiphany and learns from her actions.""Brave"" receives all the humor, character, heart and visual detail of its Pixar brethren, but much of its achievements will get overlooked. The animation, for example, could be considered among the studio's finest, yet the story and characters are so engaging you forget about it aside from some sweeping landscape shots.Therefore, the bar set by Pixar is the biggest hurdle for ""Brave."" Innovation has always been the studio's norm, but the only real innovation in in the film is a major plot point that the marketing keeps close to the chest. This will lead some viewers to classify ""Brave"" as one of Pixar's ""lesser"" efforts, but wrongly so. ""Brave"" is everything you could want from a fairy tale and then some, but a fairy tale is a fairy tale.~Steven CThanks for reading! Visit moviemusereviews.com",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

"Not Pixar's Weakest, don't fall victim to the hate","Pixar really can't do any wrong. Brave marks the 13th time a Pixar film has taken the top spot at the box office. That's everyone one of their films starting with Toy Story.Brave tells the classic story of all teenagers and their relationships with their parents. Merida, a Scottish Princess, wants to be free to choose her suitor, much like in Aladin. Out of frustration, she turns to a witch who promises to change her fate and mother, Queen Elinor, who want's Merida to act more like a princess and spend less time shooting her bow. And everyone knows, you can't trust witches who promise you your greatest desires.Quickly after casting a spell on her mother, Merida regrets her little mistake. However, something good does come out of the spell. Merida and Elinor get to spend quality time together, while actually taking the time the listen to each other under ""unique circumstances"".Brave does a great job of capturing the dynamics of any stereotypical family. It showcases a whiney teenage girls, three reckless and spoiled sons, a controlling mother, and an oblivious father. And that is truly the magic of Pixar. While the movie is entertaining and has good themes for children, anyone can enjoy Brave.After watching all of the trailers and a few TV spots for Brave, I was surprised of some of the plot turns. Now, I can't reveal anything here with out spoiling anything but I will say it was unexpected but like Pixar usually does, they make 'strange' work.Some things to point out:This is the first Pixar film with a female protagonist. I think that's a great step for Pixar industry.I really enjoyed the commination of the great score with the soft-rock singles. It reminded me a little of Tarzan.Merida's hair was amazing.It was way funnier than I thought it was going to be.Overall, Brave was brilliant. Definitely a good time. I can't talk about too much without spoling the movie.It ranks at least in my top 3 Pixar films.

My top favorite film from Pixar,"I had seen it at theaters, and now Brave is my top favorite film from Pixar because of it's beautiful soundtrack by Patrick Doyle (Quest for Camelot) and the film's leading lady. I really hated the ""bashing"" I would see over the internet.The story is about the tomboyish Princess Merida, who grows tired of her daily life of restricting princess lessons from her queenly mother Elinor. Merida then decides to go against royal tradition, which is refusing to take a husband from the oldest son of one of three lords from other clans. Seeking to change her fate, Merida receives a spell from a reclusive, eccentric forest witch, but by doing this, unleashes a terrible ancient curse. That is all I could tell you. And I don't favorite a scene (as I said many times), because I love the whole film from beginning to end.One thing I would like to point out is why would they at Pixar choose the name ""Merida"" because some Scottish names are hard for kids to pronounce. Another reason is that I thought since the film is set in the Dark Ages, in the pre-written times of a Celtic people known as the Pictish, predating the Roman era in Scotland's history, where Latin was still spoken; it is a Latin name. Also, I had read it in ""The Art of Brave"" book.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Very sub-par for Pixar,"Our family loves Pixar films, so we eagerly anticipated the release of 'Brave.' However, we were very disappointed. It is the worst Pixar film we've ever seen.The main character, Merida, is not a lovable heroine like Mulan; instead, she is a whining, bratty child. She has no endearing qualities like one would find in Snow White or Belle.The plot does not make sense, either. Merida doesn't want to get married and believes if she changes her mother's mind on the matter, she won't have to. Nevermind the culture of the time and pressures of her father and her political system, right? It's nonsense that changing her mother's mind would have any effect on whether or not she'd have to get married.We hadn't read a lot of reviews before going, so we were a little surprised by the whole plot, which is that Merida's mother is turned into a bear by Merida's selfish act of poisoning her with a cake she gets from a witch. The mother dealing with being in the bear body is funny for about thirty seconds. Unfortunately, it goes on for the majority of the film.I guess we're supposed to see that mother and daughter find common ground in the woods and come to respect each other. However, emotionally, the film is completely flat. You will not find the loving family bonds from The Incredibles here! And forget about the heart string tugs you saw in Up... not happening in Brave.The accents are over the top. Yeah, I get it, they're Scottish. But we're not. They could have toned that down a little.The potty humor and grotesque portrayal of EVERY adult male in the film made it feel more like a lower-class Dreamworks film than a Pixar/Disney.Overall, very disappointing. Had it been a Dreamworks, it would have been maybe a 7/10, but Pixar has set the bar so high with other films, that we really expected better.",4.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Overestimated a bit but solid,"Let us get it out of the way first: the animation looks awesome. The atmosphere, the design, the movements - it all looks great and it is a shame we do not see more of it.The characters are also great at their base value - distinct, likable and cute.A good foundation has been set However, the hype for Brave actually seems to have carried it higher then it would have flown otherwise, on its own wings.In true 21st century fashion, the story concentrates around a teenager girl who is rebellious and stronger than her society sees her or wants her to be. Several chieftains' sons compete in a tournament with her marriage as prise but, as the trailers showed you, she enters the tournament to compete for her own hand. You know what, let us just write ""feminist"" on her back, put her in pants and call it a day.Without giving too much away, the rest of the story is bland and cliché, or rather a combination of clichés. It's not entirely predictable, but just because you mix the clichés up doesn't mean that the product is going to be original, people! Having said that, the reason why Brave is not predictable is also not positive: it tends to have a problem with the flow. Like a malfunctioning gearbox it switches to strange gears at wrong times. I also did not like the logic that the film imposes on the viewer, especially in its ending, which feels rushed, as if the producer came into the room of the developers and said ""Ok that's enough messing around, finish it off now!"" and so they did.The bottom line: while the animation and characters are good, the story is bland, strange and comes off as preachy without having a message to preach.

"Breathtaking visuals, slightly disappointing 3D","This film has reinvented Pixar for any number of reasons; not least of which that it is set in 10th century- Scotland. It was, indeed rather remarkable that Pixar chose this storyline above other, less controversial screenplays. Perhaps it had something to prove; this is, after all the first film with a female protagonist and (sort of) director.As a Welshman, I have grown up with tales and legends of concepts like this one, as have other Celtic countries (I.E. Ireland and Scotland) but considering that the film was of American origin they (Pixar) had made a great effort to source a Scottish and otherwise British voice cast, and to learn of the traditional culture of Scotland, and a 10th century UK.The music of Brave was beautiful, really well composed and performed. It made use of Celtic and Scottish instruments (fiddle, Celtic harps, flutes and bodhrán etc.) with a hint Of contemporaryness which I can't quite put my finger on. Patrick Doyle has done a great job (Touch The Sky is already on my I- Pod!)Perhaps the best part of the movie were the visuals. Simply breathtaking (especially in 3D!) the highlands and forest of Scotland were, in their own way, the true star of the movie, and The Animators should be proud. The only let- down on this front were the darker scenes, which look even darker through 3-D glasses, for one scene at the end especially.This is a must-see that takes on a far more mature tone than other films in this genre, and while the younger children came out of theatre sleeping, everyone around us was gripped by the film.

"Still not back to masterpiece form, but Pixar slightly redeems with Brave","Cars 2 was the ultimate proof that Pixar is indeed mortal and capable of producing filth.Brave is proof that Pixar still has a ways to go before reaching its previous masterpiece status---the movie didn't even feel like it matched the title.But despite not having the emotional complexity of Up, the humor of Toy Story 2, or even the distinctive creativity of Monster's Inc., Brave still works in many levels and will entertain us all just like your usual Pixar fare. Like Pixar's best, there was a clear multitude of effort in terms of the storytelling, the voice acting, and especially its animation.Brave is about a feisty carefree princess that is absolutely not ready for a suitor, and not ready for the lifestyle of a queen. After a nasty spat with her mom, she sets off and makes a drastic decision leading to a difficult series of events. Without spoiling too much, Brave offers plenty of twists to the usual rebel-against-the-parents story that we see in kids movies.The outstanding part of this movie is the animation, which is leagues above anything else the competitors can weave. From the backgrounds to the action sequences to the subtle clever visual jokes to the staggering details concerning Princess Merida's hair, Brave looks spellbindingly gorgeous. The voice acting was also superb, as plenty of emotion was delivered by Kelly McDonald, Billy Connolly, and Emma Thompson.What will make this princess-driven movie stand out is Merida herself. She has quite a personality that in sharp contrast to princesses in animated and live-action ranging from Snow White to Princess Fiona in later Shrek films. She is funny, caring, adventurous, and far stronger emotionally and physically then what we are used to seeing on screen. The shameful part is that on the latter half we don't see her adventurous qualities---she barely uses her bow and arrow that had been sprinkled all over the marketing (which is definitely the worst part of Brave and most likely will hinder its box office receipts).As a matter of fact its the latter half that prevents this from being something truly magical and special. We don't see the Braveness in Brave, we don't see Merida as much action but more in a preparedness pose, and ultimately the climax wraps around a bit too quickly. The changing of directors definitely had a profound effect on the pacing and direction of the movie.Have no fear however, the little kids will definitely enjoy Brave. There is still enough humor, heart, and suspense to propel this past your usual computer animated drivel. And the Pixar fanatics will just be thrilled that its a turn back to originality after experiencing sequel after sequel---------And Cars 2.",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

The music is beautiful, making up for the lack of singing animals. The animation is beautiful, certainly with a unique flair to it. Merida is a beautiful character with plenty of character traits and development, it's obvious lots of thought was put into her.

"Scary for kids, but refreshingly feisty for a Disney Princess movie.","I've gotta say, it's hard to find negatives about ""Brave"". The animation is breathtakingly lifelike - it's easy to forget you're watching an animated movie. And the scenery is a beautiful, if not accurate, representation of Scotland. And it's nice to see a princess movie that's about the princess, not her romantic prospects. Finally, he cast is incredibly talented, and all the Scottish brogues can be enchanting at times. Considering that voice actors record their parts separately, the interaction between Thompson and Macdonald is almost too good to be true. The mother-daughter relationship is believable and sometimes even comic - like when Bear-Elinor fusses at Merida to get her makeshift weapon off the table.The problem is, ""Brave"" isn't original or sophisticated enough to join the Pixar hall of fame. The story is simple and sweet, but unlike Pixar classics like ""Toy Story"", ""Finding Nemo"", and ""WALL-E"", if you look hard enough, there's a similar movie out there. He most obvious example is Merida: while she may be a strong female character, she falls into the trap of being yet another frustrated, self-absorbed teenager. The artistry is incredible. Merida is probably the most admirable Disney princess yet. But it's a little disappointing for a Pixar movie.

Pixar's Persistence is Right,"I have to say that only by adhering to my own traditions can I have really good works.

A more mature and darker Pixar movie,"Let me start by saying I am not a parent of any young child, and I am also not a child myself. I'm in that middle group called the 20 somethings and so I was questioning whether I should go to this movie at all. I ended up going with my younger sister and my mom and I am glad I went, and especially glad I went with my mom.This movie, I believe, is intended for older kids and their parents. There are a lot of moments that could be scary to little kids. And some of the main themes of the movie are hard for younger kids to grasp. I would recommend waiting for the DVD if you have young (under 6 yo or so) kids.Now this movie is not, to me, as good as some other Pixar movies overall. But I did feel the themes and the emotions this movie conveys are absolutely above many other animated Pixar movies. The movie was incredibly touching. The relationship between Merida and her mother is the underlying story. And seeing this and thinking about your relationship with your own mother, whether you are 10, 20, or 50, really helps bring this movie to life.Overall, not the best Pixar movie for most.

"Good, but not up to usual Disney standard","Brave is an interesting movie, but after seeing other Disney films, I had higher expectations. The plot is very simplistic and predictable. Kids will still love it, but it will not be as fun for adults. Let's compare this movie to Tangled, which is a masterpiece -- complicated plot lines and breathtaking plot twists, right up to the very end. Tangled also has incredible characters that add so much to the story and watchability (that horse!), making it a movie you want to see again and again. Brave is visually stunning, but the overall story is just so-so -- too predictable. I've read so many reviews of this movie that focus on Merida's hair and how amazing it looked -- you know you have a weak story if all everyone talks about is the girl's hair! (Which I do agree was amazing.) Elements I liked: Merida, the princess, is very strong, smart, capable, and independent - a fantastic role model for little girls. I love that Disney is continuing to bring strong girls into the role of princess. I also love that this story was not ultimately about being rescued by a prince or finding Mr. Right. Elements I did not like: Merida's father, the king, is depicted as a strong warrior who will face down a huge bear without fear, but is a joke as a leader -- his wife, the queen, constantly has to do his speaking for him and direct him, making him look weak, treating him almost like a child. The queen is a very strong woman, but why does the king have to be depicted as a weak leader by comparison? Can't there be a strong queen AND a strong king who knows how to lead and speak for himself? It's as if the writers wanted to emphasize the queen's strength by making the king look like a buffoon, which I don't think is necessary. I also thought the silent little brothers were weird. Clearly, the writers were trying to introduce some comic relief and some interest for boys watching this movie, but it was strange that they never spoke -- they were truly little imps. Bottom line: your kids will enjoy this movie, it's a very nice story and visually stunning, but don't expect to be blown away.",6.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

"A Fine Fable, Its Limited Scale Left Me Wishing for More","A warm, cozy fairy tale that feels more like a Disney production than the latest entry in Pixar's storybook. It's sweet, quirky and funny, but routinely falls back on familiar motifs and often seems criminally under-explored. Since the vast majority of the action takes place in and around a single locale, there's a claustrophobic quality in the air that never truly dissipates, which robs us of the grand scale that's been present in every one of the animation factory's preceding works. It's no more than a straightforward telling of a reasonably interesting fable, with only a few short jolts of the unique character and timely laughs I've come to expect from the troupe. Of course, there's no arguing the fact that Pixar knows how to produce gorgeous scenery, and Brave is yet another leap forward in that regard; the surrounding landscapes are unanimously breathtaking, and Princess Merida's hair is constantly bouncy and lifelike, truly a character unto itself. It's an enjoyable fresh ride and a marked improvement over the lifeless Cars 2, but misses the depth and flair that made me fall so deeply in love with the studio's classics.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

"OK, so I'm a Pixar junkie.","I'll admit 'Brave' doesn't have quite the wall to wall boldness, rule-breaking and sheer brilliance of the very best of Pixar's work, but I'll still take it over 95% of the Hollywood films I've seen this year. It never bored me, it made me smile a lot, laugh a little, and was a more touching look at the complexity of mother and daughter relationships than most grown-up films that try to deal with the subject. It also has a heroine who is a spunky, tough and first rate advocate for girl power, while still being heart-meltingly vulnerable at just the right moments. And it has tremendously talented voice actors in Billy Connolly, Kelly Maccdonald, and especially Emma Thompson. Most important, it has a twist half-way through that takes it in a delightfully unexpected direction. I will admit, for the first half I was a bit under-whelmed, The film seemed more Disney than Pixar, with 'safe' humor and ideas. Just a touch disappointingly predictable. But then a witch gets involved in this medieval Scottish tale, and with a twist that's more Shakespearian comedy than Disney, suddenly this is a new film we haven't seen before. The second half easily won me back over, and I was left feeling, as I always seemed to be, that working for Pixar must be about the greatest job in movies.",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Highland Fling For Young Girls,"""Brave"" is basically a mother-daughter tale set in the Scottish Highlands and spiced with mirth, myth and magic. It is suitably action-packed and centred around a young red-haired heroine that most of today's young girls can relate with. However, its magical elements tend to run away with the story and leave older viewers dissatisfied.The heroine is Merida (Kelly MacDonald), a skilled archer and impetuous daughter of King Fergus (Billy Connolly) and Queen Elinor (Emma Thompson). Determined to carve her own path in life, Merida defies an age-old suitor custom sacred to the uproarious lords of the land: the massive Lord MacGuffin (Kevin McKidd), surly Lord Macintosh (Craig Ferguson) and cantankerous Lord Dingwall (Robbie Coltrane). Merida's actions inadvertently unleash chaos and fury in the kingdom, and when she turns to an eccentric old Witch (Julie Walters) for help, she is granted an ill-fated wish. The ensuing peril forces Merida to discover the meaning of true bravery in order to undo a beastly curse before it's too late.The first half of ""Brave"" is suitably absorbing, fleshing out the characters and personalities, especially of Merida and her mother who are the strongest individuals in conflict against each other. The others in the cast, especially the males, are mostly presented as caricatures, with all of them behaving like buffoons. The free-spirited Merida will not take her pick of them as her suitor - despite Queen Elinor's attempts to bend her daughter's will to the dictates of custom and tradition.The story gets a bit weirder in the second half when it takes on a body-switch twist. From this point on, the battle of wills between mother and daughter is all but put aside as our attention turns to Merida's new crisis. Some reviewers have attributed the movie's lack of plot coherence to the fact that story creator Brenda Chapman left the project midway, leaving Mark Andrews to maintain the directorial reins. I wish to stay neutral on this debate.However, I get the feeling that the plot is missing something when we consider that Merida, in pursuing her right to be 'liberated' rejects all suitors, but leaves her future and that of her 'kingdom' unresolved. Verdict: Not as memorable as ""Finding Nemo"" and ""Up"", but entertaining for the kids, nonetheless. (Full review at limchangmoh.blogspot.com)",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

Brave: A Bold Stride Hindered by Predictable Twists,"Brave, set against the lush backdrop of ancient Scotland, is a visually enchanting tale that marks Pixar's foray into stories led by female protagonists. The film's main character, the fiery-haired Merida, breathes life into the archetype of a rebellious princess with a contemporary twist. Voiced with palpable spirit by Kelly Macdonald, Merida challenges the patriarchal norms of her society, adding a feminist angle that's both refreshing and necessary in today's animated film landscape.The animation in Brave is, without doubt, spectacular. Pixar's team has yet again elevated the bar, crafting a world brimming with rich textures and vibrant colors that practically leap off the screen. The Scottish landscapes are rendered with such detail that they evoke a strong sense of place and atmosphere, and the character animations, especially the intricate movements of Merida's curly red hair, showcase Pixar's attention to detail.The narrative, however, is where Brave might not hit the bullseye for every viewer. The plot starts promisingly with themes of independence and self-discovery but veers into familiar territory with a somewhat predictable mother-daughter conflict and a magical mishap that feels more like a plot device than a meaningful element of the story. While the emotional journey between Merida and her mother, Queen Elinor, aims to tug at the heartstrings, it occasionally gets bogged down by the film's pacing and some narrative choices that seem to serve more as filler than as crucial developments.The supporting cast of characters, including Merida's mischievous younger brothers and the clan leaders, provides a good dose of humor and Scottish flair. However, they sometimes distract from the central storyline rather than complementing it. The film tries to juggle comedy, drama, and action, but not always successfully, leading to a mix that feels uneven at times.The musical score, composed by Patrick Doyle, enriches the film's Scottish setting with traditional Celtic influences that elevate the emotional and cultural atmosphere. Yet, despite these strong cultural and visual elements, the story doesn't quite leave the lasting impact that other Pixar films usually do.Brave is a commendable effort by Pixar to broaden its horizons with a strong female lead and some visually stunning animation. It's a good choice for a family movie night, especially for those seeking films with empowered female characters. However, its slightly undercooked plot prevents it from standing shoulder to shoulder with the best of Pixar's offerings. Brave shines bright in moments but doesn't consistently maintain that brilliance throughout its runtime.",6.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

A fascinating and beautiful movie with some weak aspects.,"Brave is a movie that you may like or don't like and for those years after it was released, everyone made the conclusion that it's not good at all. I fall on the category of people who like it, but like many others - i still have problems with it. The movie has a story that people were expecting, that didn't deliver, but that doesn't mean it's bad because of it. The problem that i have with the story is that the first act is the strongest one, while the second and the third act (except the ending, because for me it does have a very good conclusion) are the weakest. The script / dialogue is very mixed for me. I liked the main cast - Merida and her family, but the side (or supporting) characters were weak in my opinion. While i may be torn on the story, the characters and the script, it is still successful in the technical aspects - beautiful animation (with some strange movements in some moments), great sound, great music, great cinematography and great acting (depends on the country you live in).

Brave is another highly entertaining computer animated feature from Disney/Pixar,"Another year, another highly enjoyable Disney/Pixar computer animated feature for the summer.

I'll stop there and just say that what happens after what I just described brings quite of bit of uneasiness between the two but also brings them together and changes both for the better. Not as many laughs as in previous Pixar movies but there are some awesome thrills and quite a touching climax that I really don't want to reveal here.

Go Feminism!,"Thank God ""Brave"" isn't as historically serious (and/or boring) as the trailers made it out to be. Directed by Brenda Chapman, who was then fired and replaced by Mark Andrews (probably for the better) ""Brave"" is the much anticipated new animated feature film from the geniuses at Pixar centered around the story of a young Scottish princess. With mind-blowing animation and a simplistic but highly entertaining storyline, after the whole ""Cars 2"" fiasco, ""Brave"" will undoubtedly spell a return to form for the Lebron James of animation that is Pixar Studios. And when I say mind-blowing animation, the hair speaks for itself.With a storyline that should not be solely considered non-abrasive cartoon feminism at its best, but a touching mother/daughter tale as well, ""Brave"" tells the story of Princess Merida, a Scottish princess with fiery red hair, who is skilled in archery, horseback riding and stubbornness. When her mother informs her that there is to be a competition taking place where young men from neighboring families will fight for Merida's hand in marriage, this progressive adolescent princess will have none of it. Determined to thwart her mother's wishes, Princess Merida sets out into the enchanted woods to find the one ""magical thing"" (that's what you call foreshadowing) which will make her mother change her mind and in turn change Merida's own fate. Yes, this type of heroine may draw comparisons to Disney princesses of the past, but with a more tomboyish adventurous spirit (rivaling a female action character such as ""Mulan"").With a super simplistic storyline, in comparison to other Pixar films, ""Brave"" is front loaded with very welcome and marvelously constructed slapstick comedy and very colorful supporting characters which makes up for a second half slump. But before I get to the issues pertaining to the almost irrational plot twist the second half of the film takes, allow me to praise the work in the first half. From the characters, especially Merida and her three toddler aged brothers, who steal the show, providing audiences with a multitude of laugh out loud moments (seriously, they are as rambunctiously endearing as the fat kid from ""Up"") to the slapstick driven storyline of the three hilariously awkward suitors, the first 45 minutes of ""Brave"" are almost perfect. It is when other, more fantastical characters, whose magical circumstances are not very well thought out, arise in the latter half of the film that the movies as a whole takes a bit of a nosedive; that is to say many audiences (young and old) will be finding themselves waiting for the next laugh. With that said, the first half is so strong, that the latter, more eventful but far less engaging, half can be forgiven and even forgotten.Final Thought: Again, when compared to other Pixar gems, excluding the snoozer that was ""Cars 2"" (boy, I hated that movie) ""Brave"" doesn't really stand out (primarily for lack of storyline complexity). But on its own merits ""Brave"" is not only a film worth paying 10+ dollars to see, but is sure to be a front runner for Best Animated Feature Film come Oscar season. Plus, this is Disney's second attempt in only a short while (I am referring to ""The Princess and the Frog"") at playing the culturally aware card, by using the Scottish born voice-work of Kelly MacDonald, Billy Connolly and Emma Thompson...and that should count for something if you look at Disney's culturally insensitive past.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

But she ends up doing something for which she has only less time to amend it. With movies like Toy Story, WALL-E, Finding Nemo in the hit list, Brave is a slight disappointment from Disney Pixar. The producers always had something new to offer, but this time, they gave us what was already told which resembles to Little Mermaid. It also tells the tale of a girl who likes to live life on her terms. Brave has great technicality and beautiful visuals. But that does not seem to be enough to impress. The music is not really impressive and the dialogues are plain. This is the first time that Pixar showcased female as the protagonist and indeed she is convincing and also an inspiration to growing girls to choose what they like. But at the same having their bond attached to the family. After all said and done, the movie offers a message for growing kids. And hence, let them take that message with this red haired beauty.",6.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
A Pixar Film That Barely Succeeds,"The moment I read the critic reviews about ""Brave,"" I had to rush immediately to the local movie theater to watch and see what they saw. After watching every scene and the entire story unfold, I was actually impressed all the way to the end!So, it focuses on a rebellious princess named Merida that dreams to live her own life the way she wants it, rather than having to follow her family's royal, age-old traditions.As one critic stated in his review, it's reminiscent of Pixar's 2003 movie ""Finding Nemo."" Why? Because the thematic element of that movie focused on the bonding between a father and son, whereas ""Brave"" focused on the complete opposite by focusing on the bonding between a mother and daughter. And I started to get that impression as well. Not to mention that it seems to have a cross of the thematic material of ""Finding Nemo"" and (hint) a similar scenario of Disney's hand-drawn film ""Brother Bear.""Overall, I thought it was a Pixar film that greatly surpasses the 2011 critical disappointment of Cars 2. Although I'll admit the film's story felt rushed and could have expanded slightly more, it was legitimate enough and had some mature elements older kids could understand. Fellow 'Harry Potter' alums like Julie Walters, Emma Thompson, and Robbie Coltrane, did a fine job bringing their characters to life with such poise. But, I was in awe seeing and hearing a well-done acting performance by Scottish native/actress Kelly MacDonald (of Boardwalk Empire fame) voicing the lead Merida, and a first for Pixar Animation Studios to focus more on not just their first female lead or first fairy tale-theme, but leaning towards a darker tone compared to their previous lighthearted CG films. It's a welcoming addition to the Pixar Feature collection.",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
"Not quite at par with Pixar's high standard, but a decent watch","Pixar can pretty much do no wrong, but they've had a few mediocre moments when they're not quite invincible, either. This movie is alright, but not really worth the money you'll need to shell out for a family of four.At once, there's a glimmer of Moulan, which was one of Disney's all-time poorest offerings. The elements of a teen girl wanting to prove her equality to her male peers and aspire to new things is betrayed by an attitude in these combat movies that actually says ""you should bash as many people's heads as you can simply because you can."" Princess Medea's selfish behavior doesn't help; she comes across quickly as a self- important brat, rather than the ""Brave"" heroine she is meant to represent. Her constant bickering with another character becomes tedious.That's the negatives, but there are many things to cite on the positive side of the ledger. You won't be bored by this movie; it has lots of action, clever dialogue, fun sub-plots, and a well-developed central thread of a story to tell. At the times when the main character is written as the brilliant heroine the writer meant her to be, it comes through with flying colors. Speaking of color; this is a Pixar film: get ready to experience their vivid imagery and masterful animation. The backgrounds are exquisite, the characters well defined. Even tiny details are not missed, such as a close-up of a hand injury.Kids will like it, and adults too--it appeals to different tastes with different levels of humor and drama. However, it's not quite at what I'll call the ""forever memorable"" level of movie making that Pixar often achieves.It's best to wait for this one to show up on cable or as a rental.",6.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Honestly... this movie bagged an Oscar!!!!,"A highly predictable, high melodramatic storyline, which you have seen/read in a thousand TV shows/books . Standard quality animation (why should anyone be bothered about the hair?), blackish background which makes the movie thoroughly dull. Pixar has lost its touch and Disney is suffering from a serious lack of innovation. In fact, after watching this movie I am convinced that Disney is now fit to enter the business of Indian or Bengali daily soaps.Predictably, again Disney is obsessed with wronged princesses, funny horses (here not so funny) and evil witches (those poor ladies, who in most of the cases turn out to be the heroin's mother). Thank god there is at least no prince charming in this movie. The girl seems obnoxious, selfish. Moreover, what makes this movie a particular horror show is the way Disney haplessly try to incorporate scenes with underlying sexual meanings. And those series of pink butts is quite disgusting.Overall, I do not believe this movie is ever going to please a sensible person / Scottish person. Utterly forgettable movie. Not funny, not tragic, does not inspire any type of emotion excepts irritation. Perhaps just one time watch.@Pixer/Disney, Why not make a male-oriented movie for a change?",4.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Derivative Artwork and Naughty Heroine,"""Brave"" is the story of another feisty Disney princess, given the PIXAR treatment. Her name is Merida, a Scottish princess. She is a headstrong tomboyish teenage who cannot accept the tradition espoused by her strict mother that she is to be betrothed for marriage. Therefore she resorts to witchcraft to change her fate. She really got more than what she bargained for, a shocking development of ursine proportions. She later learns that she has only a couple of days to reverse the terrible spell. Could she?""Brave"" is just okay for me overall. It is still better than the last Pixar movie, ""Cars 2."" While on the surface everything looks good and glossy, especially the archery scenes, there are several things that I did NOT like about ""Brave.""Art-wise, while Merida and her fiery red hair looked great, the caricature-ish look of the Scotsmen were drawn so much like the Vikings in Dreamworks' ""How to Train Your Dragon."" The brutish barbaric culture they exhibited likewise shows very little difference from that in ""How to Train"", aside from the kilts the characters wore in this movie and their Scottish accents.Screenplay-wise, ""Brave"" goes a little darker and violent, and thus may be too scary or disturbing for young kids. More than that, I did not like how Merida did not immediately take responsibility for the horrible effects of the witch's spell. While many of the other Disney princesses also disobey their parents and get into trouble, those princesses themselves directly suffered the consequences of their disobedience. Here, Merida's insolence put another person in peril. Merida actually did something akin to what the Wicked Witch did in Snow White! Frankly, it is this particularly negative aspect of the story that badly affected my appreciation of this movie as a whole.",6.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
UN-DER-RA-TED!!!,"I don't get why people think that Brave is a bad movie. I think it's one of Pixar's 5 best movies so far.

Aesthetically pleasing but derivative adventure,"You may remember how the trailer to this gave you very little idea of what the plot was about.Well she accidently has her mother turned into a bear. That's what happens. I was watching this think ""wait...haven't they done this idea before? Emporer's new grove did a similar thing but with a Llama, The Princess and the Frog did this but with frogs and Brother did this but with...the exact same animal"". I know Pixar IS NOT Disney. At least not in essence.I'm not saying that each of these 4 movies don't have their own nuances, styles and ideas to explore, only it seems a bit of a tired idea by this point.The first act has an ostentatiously feminist verve, like it's desperate to be this decade's Mulan. But we don't need another Mulan because we have Mulan. Is it saying something else pertinent about feminism? Not really. We have a heroine, the kind that idents love to call ""plucky"" or Feisty"", who filches apples, who pouts in an unladylike way and then uses her bow and arrow like a boss.The first act seems pretty engaging as she dares to compete with her own suitors ""for her own hand"".But this movie that was so happy to wave the flag of girl power thought it was good idea to turn the whole thing into one of the most effeminate road trip movies you can imagine. I don't care that one is a bear. Is it really feminist to make this just some female analogue to a Goofy Movie? Or to adnadone the badassdom to just have a story of female bonding? (I suppose they're the same thing as much as I love A goofy Movie).I'm not saying there aren't stuff to like: these kinds of movies always have a lot of visual wit and talent that draw you into the world they've created with its details, textures, rich characterisation, inoffensive but wonderful humor and general sense of wonder. The radiant aesthetic of the Celtic autumn, its sound track full of local color and pop ballads (that you will hate to love but love all the same) plus the scope of its set pieces make sure that seeing this is not a waste. It's just that it's main plot got a bit misguided.What made Mulan so wonderful is that Mulan wasn't sure which world she belonged to more and was on just as much of a learning curve as the men in becoming a soldier. Of course I need to stop thinking this is trying to be Mulan because it's clearly so different but, as anyone who has a seen a Miyakzaki movie will tell you, taping on some progressive colors does not mean you have instantly charmed every progressive in the room.One of the lesser efforts of its studio but it's still not half bad.",6.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
A great movie. Extremely underrated,"This agreat story, just not the typical disney story. It has no love in, at least not romantic love and people cannot seem to like a movie without it. Yes, the plot can be basic and predictable but as like every other animated film. Its an amazing movie that touches lots of topics and that was a big eye opener for my young me about family and the role of women. The anima5ion and visual of it is AMAZING.

"Good family entertainment, catch this one on mother's day for sure","""Brave"" has a lot of laughs, a touching story about the relationship between a girl and her mother and some interesting, well developed characters. The film looks great (the hair and clothes look better in this film than in any other computer generated movie) and it has a lot of subtle qualities that make it enjoyable. My favorite? The lack of a contrived love plot, something present in countless children's movies? When I was a kid, I didn't care about getting married and I know most of my friends didn't pay any attention the idea either, so why do so many children's films shoehorn in those love plots? I also liked that there are some jokes aimed more at the parents, without the movie using innuendo or other cheap ""adult"" gags so there's something for everyone here. It's not Pixar's strongest film, but it's better than most movies aimed at kids and you'll be hard pressed to find a family movie about a mother and a teenage daughter that will make you smile as much as this one.

Great step back in right direction for Disney.,"BRAVE is a decent example of the type of deep, emotional films Disney USED to make. Pixar Movies have never, at least for me, ever reached an emotional level as that of many Disney films. The combination of Pixar's brilliant animation and Disney charm really make me feel that BRAVE is a decent step back in the right direction.Disney, in my opinion, has lacked in the story department for the last 10 years. Brother Bear (2003) being the last remarkable and deep plot. BRAVE shows much of Brother Bear and its components of love, forgiveness, and tolerance.Disney films, and basically every Pixar film, being released has a shallow, un-relatable plot. Toy Story very slimly being an exception. Disney needs to get back to making the types of movies which made it how popular it is today. Getting back to these universal ideas and themes would improve the quality of future content. The attention to the story needs to be increased, instead of focusing on creating marketable characters. Really, what Disney animated film won't be successful in this day and age. Disney is big enough to be able to sacrifice marketability for substance.I like to FEEL something, anything while watching a film. BRAVE I can happily say, gave me chills. I have yet to feels this with really any Pixar film or any Disney film in the past 10 years.Overall, BRAVE is a great step back in the right direction for Disney. Now the only thing to do is wait and see whether or not they realize the good thing they've stumbled upon.",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Just saw Brave,"PRO: Pixar has done yet another amazing project; first fairytale for Pixar. Expect stunning effects, scenery and characters that only Pixar can create. Indeed family lessons are learned, especially between a mother and a daughter. It is a great coming of age story with a legalistic mother and a freedom loving daughter. There are a lot of good messages in the storyline.CON: There is a darker side to this story than what has been seen previously in Disney and Pixar productions. Scary scenes are pushing the envelop of a kid-friendly movie. There is some off-color humor that does not add an ounce to the story. We are forced to deal with the servant woman's cleavage scenes and Merida's brother diving in at one point. There was the mooning scene of one of the Lords and of course the bare backsides of all the men after climbing down the castle wall. These scenes definitely pushed this into a PG+ movie.",5.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Mesmerizing,"24 June 2012. Both visually even in 2-D and substance, Brave depicts a mesmerizing eyeful of dazzling and clear animation along with focused mother-daughter relational storyline and surprisingly intense action that offer not one but two climatic scenes. Brave has the intensity and emotional connectivity of The Lion King (1994) and exquisite texture and animated detail as well as the storyline perfectly suited to animation of Bolt (2008).Brave offers a rare mother-daughter storyline in a format and a magical way that is both a treat and creative and bold presentation. Found in other genres such as horror in Dark Water (2005), family drama in Georgia Rules (2007) the relational element of Brave makes this movie a stand out. With good editing, good script that includes plenty of humor and the American penchant for individualism, all of it comes together is an entertaining and captivating summer animated action movie for children (with elements of violence).",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
A Celtic Departure for Pixar,"I kind of missed all the marketing hullabaloo when this was in the cinema and so watched this hype free, with my kids, curled up on the sofa eating popcorn.As ever the animation is sumptuous and Pixar really are peerless when it comes to this kind of stuff but I don't think it has escaped their - or our - notice that all the other animation studios have caught up in that department; is it any better that How to Train Your Dragon? Or Tangled? I do wonder...the hair is great, the Highland setting is detailed in a way that that shows utter dedication to one's craft. I still think Pixar are at the top of the league, though.The thing, however, that defines a Pixar movie for me is that the animation is almost secondary to the dialogue, characters and plot. I liked it. I thought the characters were clearly defined and funny, beautifully designed with superb voice acting. My kids sometimes got a touch lost with the plot (I found myself scratching my head a couple of times to be honest) but overall they adored the story and got swept up in the final third of the film.This is not one of Pixar's best movies - it's a bit of a Ratatouille (which I love BTW) in that it seems to struggle to play to both audiences, to adults and children alike. My kids loved it and I really liked it as well. Would I see it again? Yeah, I probably would, but there is a certain something missing from this movie and I think that it is a bit of emotion. I didn't fall in love with any of the characters like Woody...or Wall-E...or grouchy Mr Fredricksen.There is a tiny spark of Pixar magic missing from this film...but it's still a great film",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Powerful mother-daughter discovery,"People who gave 1, 2, 3 stars really have not understood at all what they watched. Reading the explanations of these low scores let me think that they saw the film full of prior prejudices or without any attention at all, even at the mere realization. Maybe the male characters are caricatural, but they are only a countour of the mother-daughter storyline that is just powerful. Watch this film without blinders, then you will appreciate it.P.S. For me it was a 8, but I give it 10 to counteract the low grades. It is an ANIMATION film, only thinking at all the work and all the people behind it make the extremely low rates an insult.

Angus the horse is just adorable.The fun escalates significantly when the witch's curse starts working, and our hero must find a way to reverse the spell again. There are a few interesting twists along the way, as well. This was stunning!!

Great and completely worthy of the Oscar,"I saw Brave today at the cinema on a special screening of the movie. I had already seen it before but I am doing the review now because in those times I hadn't an IMDb account.

When I first saw it I completely regretted all the negative comments I said about it before even seeing it (I wanted Wreck-it Ralph to win).It has an excellent story and character development of the protagonists. I loved the character of Merida, as well as her parents, her brothers and probably everyone else too. The script doesn't stop being funny lighthearted and perfectly well done.Highly recommended to everyone, not just Disney fans (my father loved it and he doesn't usually see animated movies). Probably almost everyone has seen this movie much time ago, but in case you haven't, this will be completely useful for you.Thanks for reading!",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Love Scotland. Love Pixar. Not too keen on this.,"'Brave' has been taking some hits, especially since garnering an undeserved Oscar, and it is not hard to see why. By Pixar's own high standards, and especially their famed commitment to storytelling, this film fails to engage with its audience. My kids came out of Toy Story and Monsters Inc saying ""Wow"", but reacted to Brave with ""s'awright."" That clinches it for me.The problem lies in the supernatural element that compromises character-driven action. Nemo's father goes on a journey that forces him to face his fears. He overcomes his challenges by compassion and daring. Merida goes on a journey instigated by, and resolved with the help of, Will O' the Wisp. This deus ex machina element robs Brave of the cathartic power previous Pixar films have achieved.The visual comedy was also rather sporadic and subdued. A few clichéd pokes at Scotland were unimaginative; haggis as inedible, no pants under kilts - moments that also passed children by. The suitor with the incomprehensible accent raised a smile with us, but we've had more and better laughs with Pixar in the past.Back to basics, Pixar people.",5.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Pixar Back After Jumping The Shark,"""Brave"" came out as the next release after the abomination called ""Cars 2"". I thought Pixar was finally out of ideas. Then they came up with an idea that let the girl be the hero (remember this was before ""Frozen""). It was nice to see a girl who was not pure princess, snarky, and beautiful. But her looks do not factor into her character. Merida is her father's daughter: adoringly and awesomely played by Billy Connolly. His King Fergus is manly, macho, and mush in Merida's hands! But while many female characters are hateful towards their parents they have Merida as rebellious but not a woke jerk. I saw it at the theatre when it came out, and just watched it again for the first time since. I will continue to do so. This one is a keeper.",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

A teenagers mythical brush with fate,"This is a tale of the difficult concept of fate.Merida, the princess of a clan in mythic Scottish coast-lands (supposedly around 400 AD as there's talk of both Romans and vikings being repelled by the clans cooperating) is coming of age. To her loving mother, the queen, in particular, this means she ought to take a suitor, and in general follow the path set before her as first lady of her people. At the time in question, this entails very ladylike and tame conformity indeed. Of symbolic importance is a tapestry of the mothers make and design, hinting at the many threads in the weave of fate/proposed identity. The tapestry shows merida and her mother, among others. It's the mothers design, as is the mothers ideas of how Merida needs to behave. But Merida has her own ideas of what she needs. These get her into trouble so dire that she has to acknowledge the problem of her responses to her mothers proposals as a problem to her as well, perhaps for the first time, and the movie revolves around her making the mental transition from headstrong child to struggling adult.Brave is commonly acknowledged as state of the art of present day animation, and it is certainly a pleasure to look at the realistic yet stunningly beautiful way the wild environment has been put to life. I've rewatched the movie several times, just for that. (have it on blueray)Some have scolded the movie for being thematically difficult to follow, or for not being funny enough. While I can understand the criticism, I think it mostly stems from trouble relating to the difficult theme: that of struggling with a supposedly set fate.The concept of proposed fate/identity is commonly misunderstood as a deterministic outlook, these days, but has more to do with the idea of some lifestories/paths being fitting for a person, and the supposed folly of rebelling against it.So what to do about it - this proposed 'fate' / identity Do as you're told? Do as you please? Fight anyone who would try to oppose you? Try to do right? And what is that, exactly?Brave is about all of that, or just that: The concept of fate, and what to do about it.The title 'Brave' is arguably a poor one, except that it is the one strain of unflinching priority that goes through all Meridas developing approaches to the question of fate/identity. She never shies away from the challenges she's facing, but to begin with, the challenges she accepts as right for her are quite different from the ones society would have her take. (Be a wife, queen, mother etc. as opposed to the challenges of defending her freedom.) To begin with, she's very self-absorbed, if still good natured in a childish fashion. As the story progresses, it becomes apparent to her that this is not good enough, even by the standards of following her own heart, which she manages to do, while it matures.Personally, I applaud Pixar for a huge animation achievement, as well as a tale full of heart and humour, both subtle and overt, taking on a concept as difficult as the struggle for identity, in a manner so smooth and full of magic and adventure that even an early teen child might follow and enjoy it.8 out of 10",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

It's really different from other Disney movies where the princess gets to meet their prince charming and live happily ever after. No, not really but it's about being yourself and having the freedom to do so. Being brave and standing up for our self is a really great example for us. ""Love when you're ready"".

Be Brave,"Brave is a 2012 animated comedy-fantasy film directed by Mark Andrews and Brenda Chapman. It is the 13th Pixar film,and certainly a great one as their previous.Brave follows Merida the daughter of Scottish King Fergus and Queen Elinor. She is a skilled archer who wants to make her own fate in life and pursue her own dreams. She is then forced to get married,as the tradition requires at a certain age but she is in her own mind and seeks help from a witch to change the fate and be her own person in life.This movie is amazing,from the glorious animation to the characters who are likable just as much as they are interesting. Merida is a strong female lead character who chooses her own path in life and makes her own decisions for herself. She has dreams and most importantly is ""brave"" enough to pursue them till the very end. She's also smart and Kelly Macdonald's voice work just helps the cause with her amazing Scottish Accent.The story is very interesting and intriguing while still being emotional that gives depth to the characters. But it also has funny moments throughout,even though the finale is very dark and also even sad which in my opinion is great.People has been complaining about the twist over and over again and how it is more of a kids film than for adults,which Pixar is used to making. But I disagree because while it is an absolute treat for kids,it is also dark at times,it has adult jokes here and there and what's very important,it has character development at its finest. The place where Merida and different characters in the movie are at the beginning and where they end up is just brilliant and life changing. The lessons they learn through their adventures,them being good or bad,and the way that this movie teaches people that we can make our own fate if we are brave enough to follow our hearts,that makes for an unforgettable experience.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
"Trust me, deary. It will do the trick","Princess Merida has been interested in adventure since she was a child, so when she comes of age and her controlling mother expects her to marry someone she doesn't even know, she is very frustrated by it, and it does a number on the already troubled relationship between the two.The first of the company's female protagonist in one of the theatrical films allow them to confront gender, with all the expectations limitations those come with, especially for the fairer sex, under patriarchy. There are several clever little ways for them to comment on it, in ways that are subtle enough for anyone who doesn't already accept how important it is to fight for women's rights; we see how straining the clothes she is forced to wear are, and how they prevent her from doing the things she wants to do, and covers her luscious red hair, a significant indicator of her wild spirit.They manage a lot of expression, non verbal and otherwise, including from at least one character that is not in human form. The use of color and shadow is striking, and the setting feels lived in. It's funny. Very cute. It's genuinely emotional, including in the tense, well-choreographed action scenes, that are always driven by that aspect.I recommend this to everyone, especially fans of Pixar. 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

Brave is All Heart,"Brave is a big surprise. The Pixar produced and Disney distributed film is a story about mothers and daughters. There is no handsome Prince, but there is a Princess, a Queen, magic and a pesky witch. Oh and some bears.Pixar films are technically wondrous but can lack the warmth of the animated Disney Classics. With Brave they have finally broken that barrier. The film delivers a personal story and not, as the trailers seemed to suggest, Braveheart with a warrior princess.Our protagonist Princess Merida boasts an intricately animated mane that would make Rapunzel jealous. Merida is a tomboy and a rebel and doesn't show any signs of wanting to grow up. While her father King Fergus indulges her, mother Queen Elinor tries to teach her responsibility and constantly admonishes her to be a lady. Tensions ensue, particularly when Merida is faced with having to do her royal duty and keep the kingdom together.The plot twists into unexpected territory here – for good and bad depending on one's personal tastes, but it is refreshing nonetheless. Too many modern heroines are all ""girl power"" and not much else. Merida is a far better realized character, growing and maturing before our very eyes, and this is probably why the ending strikes such a false note. One suspects the resolution is more a result of pandering to modern tastes rather than organic growth in the characters.Nevertheless, credit goes to the script which truly captures the incredible complexity and tensions that characterize the mother-daughter dynamic, however fantastical the yarn gets. Brave sticks to a far more timeless storytelling style than most animated features today, with the now staple contemporary wise cracking of supporting characters kept to a minimum, and thankfully so. Not only do these jokes strike discordant notes that pull viewers out of the story, they ultimately serve to date these films far before their time.It will be particularly interesting to see how the film is received and reviewed internationally. Set in Medieval Scotland and clearly created with Western sensibilities in mind, the film has nonetheless harnessed some universal themes. I am South Asian, and the tensions between familial duty and individual desire resonated particularly well. I swear I've had the same confrontations with my own Mother.Is the story for everyone?

It's ironic for the first Pixar movie with actual magic involved has absolutely no movie magic of its own.,"After Cars 2 showed a potential creative blip following Pixar's peak with Toy Story 3, Brave has come to confirm the stall. Perhaps the geniuses after the last run of charming films are basking in the success of their films and now the interns are having a go just to keep the Pixar factory line churning. The question is though, is it really worth it? Financially, sure, Brave was an obvious hit, but it's ironic for the first Pixar movie with actual magic involved has absolutely no movie magic of its own. Sure, the detail in the animation is impressive, but the story is just dire. It exclaims its themes (they say ""fate"" in the annoying Scottish accent far too many times), its content comes from nowhere, the characters are irritating and none of the sight gags are funny. There's a complete disregard for the adults in the audience as it's all spoonfed yet none of it is relatable or means anything. Worst of all, the protagonist isn't brave at all, just precocious. The direction is so unimaginative with very boring choice of shots and edits to display the action. To its credit, the original songs are pretty good but it just highlights how it's a by-the-numbers film. Even though my expectations were low, Brave is very disappointing, especially for Pixar. Lets hope they never sink this low again.4/10",4.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Perfect,"Brave is moving. Princess Merida is a great heroine.. The visual effects are perfect, in my opinion, the best of ail the Pixar films.Brave cleverly twists what we think think a Disney Princess can be. It's funny and smart. The directing was perfect. The big scope is very impressive and it was very emotional. I was rooting for her the whole time and I loved the ending. I don't want to spoil it but it is very satisfying. Every scene served a purpose and every big story turn made compete sense. I will be going back to see this film again, probably twice. Best film of the summer. Especially for a pixar film.

Loved it!,"I think this is a really great movie which focuses more on family relationships rather than love relationships. It's different from other Disney movie where the princess gets to meet their prince charming and then live happy ever after. No, not really but it's about being yourself and having the freedom to do so. Being brave and standing up for our self is a really great example for us. It also shows that making mistakes isn't the end of the world, it's never too late to change. Overall Brave aimed more on young audiences which tells them that the family relationship is much more important than love relationships.",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Beautiful,"A very different type of Disney film. They did a brilliant job with such a small scale plot, and the comedic element. The greatest thing about this flick, however, is the characters, especially that of our main protagonist, Merida. They were not just one-note characters, they were given personalities and realistic qualities that define human beings. You find yourself caring for each of them throughout the movie, and this is thanks to the voice actors. Their voices brought life to this production in a way that did not seem at all forced or dull.The problem lies more with the scenes where Merida changed the Queen and tried to make up for it. These scenes have their moments, but for some reason, they seem to drag, and you find yourself guessing what's going to happen much of the time. The story picks up more often than not, but it does tend to go off the beaten path in a way that can distract, but not in a real positive light.Still, overall, the movie does not disappoint. It is not a masterpiece, but it is definitely not one that you should pass up. The animation is absolutely gorgeous, and the images are so easy on the eyes that you'll find yourself staring at the background from time to time.",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Bear-ly Average,"Scroll back two years ago - I was excited to see Brave. Toy Story 3 was fine, but it was hanging in old ground. I didn't even think of going to Cars 2. Brave looked fresh, an epic fantasy adventure from a big budget, yet highly respected studio.Saw it with the family. Came out with all four of us underwhelmed.One of Pixar's defining trademarks is its unique ideas. They can create fantastic worlds, and use plots barely explored before. You're not going to find another movie about an old man and his floating house on a quest to save a rare bird from another old man and his dogs, just for a boy's approval. Brave...is just another princess deconstruction, set in a pretty plain Scotland. There's bears, I suppose.I know that its a family movie, but the plot was so predictable, there's little suspense. Especially the ending. Jeez. I didn't love any of the characters, and its theme doesn't seem necessary today. Heck, when it comes to movies straying from princess stereotypes, Disney already produced two better films not 3 years before Brave: The Princess and the Frog and Tangled.Nothing about the film was terrible. And the animation was pretty good, although it didn't have much to do beyond the main's hair. But in terms of plot, character, and writing, nothing amazed me, or even stood out. And its more than just my tastes, as many others share similar feelings.Its skip-able. If you are going to see it, the worse thing you can do is go in with high expectations.",5.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Brave souls prosper.,"I like the direction that Disney/Pixar movies are headed. I read something recently that criticized them for not having a female protagonist sooner, but we all know why. It's the hair. Pixar spent three years making the software necessary to render Merida's poof correctly, and I can promise you it was worth waiting for. At one point she gets her hair wet, and it just looks amazing. I give the hair ten out of ten.As for the movie, it gave me the fuzzies inside, so that's good. There were a few parts that I didn't like and I won't say them so as not to spoil the film. It's pretty crude at points, which is a nice change for D/P to make. Wonderful voice casting, amazing animation, and an all-around good time.",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

The animation? It was High School software the looked like professional software. The lessons equally balanced with comedy, power, and independence perfects it. This movie is pure beauty. plus, this is one of the only Disney animations (and I think it is the only one) that doesn't feature a love interest or prince for the princess.

A  special Disney film to enjoy,"I've seen this movie many times and I really love this Pixar film. I thought it was a fun and excellent animated film with great animation. I've always enjoyed watching Disney movies since I was young. Pixar has always made great films such as Toy Story, A Bugs life, Monsters Inc., Cars and many other films. Another one of the films I enjoyed was Ratatouille because I love to watch movies about cooking. Another reason why I love this movie is because it makes me feel relaxed too. I appreciate many creative ideas people think of to make a great movie. It's always nice to watch movies that speak to someone no matter what anyone likes or what speaks to them more. I enjoyed this film and I would give it a 10 out of 10 for a very well done Disney film with computer animation and a happy ending.

"Best animated movie in ages, inspiring and strong!","I haven't felt so inspired after a animated pg film in ages! There were strong female leads, without being clichéd. The Merdia and the queen are very likable and realistic characters (as realistic as an animated can be), strong of mind and body.The movie starts off strong and beautiful and ends the same. there's some slap stick humor in there, mainly for the kids benefit, but it didn't drag on like it does in some kids movies. It had me as an adult laughing as well.The scenery was lush, green and vibrant, with some dark forested area. Beautiful. I also liked that they incorporated ""fates"" instead of fairies which was refreshing and nice to see other cultures in mainstream films.I found it most akin to Monsters Inc, because it had that same feel good message, and more subdued slapstick (unlike Shrek)I took my 7 years old daughter and while there were a few frightening scenes, my daughter loved it.I cried like a baby at a few scenes.It had heart, plot and great voices!",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Prince not required,"The canon of Disney princesses has offered us over the years iconic characters such as Snow White, Cinderella, Ariel and Aurora, which nevertheless suffer a mild ""problem"": they teach us that happiness depends on a prince who comes to rescue. Times have changed and apparently Disney has begun to understand this, introducing gradually female characters able to see beyond a ""And they lived happily ever after.""An example of this is Merida, daughter of kings Fergus and Elinor, who must marry one of the heirs of the kingdoms that are part of the great kingdom of Dubroch in order to preserve the alliances; however there is one small detail: Merida refuses the idea of an arranged marriage, which leads her to confront her mother, who insists on keeping the tradition by educating and preparing Merida to assume her role as Queen in the future (and Merida, of course also opposes to this). The clash between the two is inevitable and in the midst of her despair Merida meets (by chance or fate perhaps?) a witch to which she asks for a spell to make change her mother. The problem is that the spell ends up being too literal and Elinor turns into a bear. With the witch gone, Merida along with her triplets brothers must reverse the spell before Elinor becomes a bear forever.With characters like Mulan or Giselle from Enchanted, Disney had already begun to give a twist to the stories of princesses, but with Tiana from The Princess and the Frog and now Merida (in collaboration with Pixar) leads to a new stage in which the female central characters look for personal fulfillment instead of finding a man that will provide a happy future. At the same time keeps them away from the ""submissive woman"" role model seen in the media for decades; in Brave, Merida is a girl with a strong and determined character who enjoys her freedom, and she's willing to take the necessary risks to correct her mistakes.Another key element for this movie work is the mother/daughter relationship, which is an unexplored factor in previous Disney movies (as most of their characters are orphaned or taken away from their family environment). The constant friction between Merida and Elinor is a reflection of the need for communication between parents and children and how the lack of understanding can force to take wrong decisions.It has been questioned whether Merida's reluctance to marriage reflects a suggestive comment about her sexual identity, but that's not necessarily part of the central idea of the film, although it is an indication that the audiences begin to look for stories they can feel more identified with. On the technical level, there's nothing to complain about, which is understandable considering the very high visual level that Pixar keeps in all of their movies, and the recreation of the scenarios of medieval Scotland is extraordinary. And last but not least, it's required to highlight the vocal work of Kelly McDonald as Merida, who gives her a unique vitality and energy, Oscar winner Emma Thompson as Queen Elinor, serene, proud and with a strong temper and Billy Connolly as King Fergus. On the other hand, the masterful score courtesy of Patrick Doyle, who makes use of classic Scottish musical instruments and captures the essence of their sound away from the cliché and with a highly emotional charge.Brave is a clear sign that times change and while Prince Charming can remain as an ideal for many women, in fact he's not so indispensable anymore.",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Scotland and its fantasies,"""Brave"" is very much unlike most Disney movies. Its princess not only wants to break tradition: she wants to go out and do things on her own, even to the chagrin of her parents. I guess that part of what was most enjoyable about it was the setting in medieval Scotland, complete with lots of Celtic imagery (and they made sure to have a mostly Scottish cast: Kelly Macdonald, Billy Connolly, Robbie Coltrane and Craig Ferguson, among others).Admittedly, there are some goofs - as revealed on the YouTube series Cinema Sins - but overall I thought that it was a respectable movie (and I say this as someone who's not usually into Disney movies).

Just as good as ever.,"Brave is a 2012 animated comedy-fantasy film directed by Mark Andrews and Brenda Chapman.It is the 13th Pixar film,and certainly a great one as their previous. Brave follows Merida the daughter of Scottish King Fergus and Queen Elinor.She is a skilled archer who wants to make her own fate in life and pursue her own dreams.She is then forced to get married,as the tradition requires at a certain age but she is in her own mind and seeks help from a witch to change the fate and be her own person in life. This movie is amazing,from the glorious animation to the characters who are likable just as much as they are interesting.Merida is a strong female lead character who chooses her own path in life and makes her own decisions for herself.She has dreams and most importantly is ""brave"" enough to pursue them till the very end.She's also smart and Kelly Macdonald's voice work just helps the cause with her amazing Scottish Accent. The story is very interesting and intriguing while still being emotional that gives depth to the characters.But it also has funny moments throughout,even though the finale is very dark and also even sad which in my opinion is great. People has been complaining about the twist over and over again and how it is more of a kids film than for adults,which Pixar is used to making.But I disagree because while it is an absolute treat for kids,it is also dark at times,it has adult jokes here and there and what's very important,it has character development at its finest.The place where Merida and different characters in the movie are at the beginning and where they end up is just brilliant and life changing.The lessons they learn through their adventures,them being good or bad,and the way that this movie teaches people that we can make our own fate if we are brave enough to follow our hearts,that makes for an unforgettable experience.",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
"""Brave: A Visually Stunning and Emotionally Captivating Adventure""","From the very beginning, ""Brave"" immerses the audience in the world of ancient Scotland, with its breathtaking landscapes, castles, and mythical creatures. The attention to detail in the animation is remarkable, making the film a visual feast for the eyes. The characters are also well-designed, with each having their own unique personality and mannerisms.One of the main themes in the movie is the relationship between Merida and her mother, Queen Elinor, which is both heartwarming and relatable. Merida is a strong-willed and independent young woman who wants to determine her own destiny, while Elinor tries to protect her daughter and prepare her for her future role as a queen. The conflict between the two is at the heart of the movie, and it's a testament to the writing and performances that the audience can empathize with both characters.In addition to the touching mother-daughter relationship, ""Brave"" also has its fair share of action and adventure. Merida's journey to break a curse and restore harmony to her kingdom is filled with excitement, danger, and unexpected twists. The film's climax is particularly thrilling and emotional, leaving the audience on the edge of their seats.Overall, ""Brave"" is a stunning and entertaining movie that both kids and adults can enjoy.

However, at the time of its release, Disney's Pixar was playing catch up to DreamWorks' progressive Princess Fiona from the Shrek series.

Not the usual Pixar quality.,"When I first saw Brave, I wasn't impressed like I usually am by Pixar.The premise is pretty generic and the mother/daughter relationship isn't very interesting, because of the clichéd story of rebelling against the old traditions of royalty. And to be honest, I didn't find Merida that likable when she more or less constantly bickered and argued with her mother. Not much new done with this material in an already lackluster story.The other members of the clan can be entertaining and the animation is beautiful as always with Pixar, but visual brilliance is only surface level quality, because a well crafted story can save mediocre animation, but not the other way around in my book.And out of all animals you can think of why should the mother be turned into a bear? Disney already given us Brother Bear, but at the very least Pixar didn't make it talk and instead added a little fun mannerisms.Mediocre by Pixar standards, but harmless as a movie in general.

Very kind movie!,"In anticipation of the release, ""Brave"" caused some concerns. Several trailers and numerous videos, frankly speaking, were not impressive. The film seemed to be an adaptation of a worn-out story about the growing up of a difficult teenager against the backdrop of Scotland during the times of brave men in kilts, witches and miracles, princesses and castles. ""I'm Merida, I don't want to get married, I want to ride through the woods, shoot arrows and have my hair develop in the wind"" - a familiar plot through the mouth of the father of the main character seemed to exhaustively describe the plot of the new Pixar film.However, the world's best animation studio has remained the best in the world, and not only because ""Brave"" is visually head and shoulders above the competition, but also because Pixar still feels the mood of the viewer like no other. Manipulating some subtle facets, ""Brave"" makes you laugh at seemingly completely new jokes and not letting the viewer really stop laughing instantly, but without interrupting the narration, moves on to dramatic, and sometimes frightening moments. If it weren't for the combination of inconspicuous details, invisible brushstrokes and the devil knows what unknown facets, Merida would be an ordinary capricious daredevil, a witch - just a stupid grandmother, Merida's mother - a collective image from thousands of other moms, but in the hands of Pixar they all truly come to life, shine with characters and again, for the umpteenth time, replay live actors. And as for the plot, even here there is only one decisive turn, which the studio wisely kept silent about, turns the stamped fairy tale upside down and behind the screen of numerous truly funny jokes, the final, predictable, but no less dramatic, comes imperceptibly.""Brave"" is a mood film. No matter how much you would like to keep a stone face, the picture will still catch on with something. And the further the narrative goes, the more you realize how much love and effort the authors have invested in this project, and although the studio has not moved away from its all-conquering love of life, ""Brave"" is similar to all Pixar projects and does not resemble any of them.A good fairy tale from an experienced storyteller.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

Brave,"Brave, directed by Mark Andrews and Brenda Chapman, is a stunning animated film from Pixar that weaves a captivating tale of courage, family, and self-discovery. Set in the enchanting landscapes of medieval Scotland, the story follows Princess Merida, a fiercely independent young woman who defies tradition in pursuit of her own destiny.From the very first frame, Brave immerses viewers in a world of breathtaking visuals, with lush forests, towering castles, and intricate Celtic designs. The animation is nothing short of extraordinary, showcasing Pixar's signature attention to detail. The colors are vibrant, and the characters are beautifully rendered, making the fantastical elements feel alive and engaging.The heart of the film lies in Merida's struggle against societal expectations. Voiced brilliantly by Kelly Macdonald, Merida is a relatable protagonist with a fiery spirit and a yearning for freedom. Her journey is not just about breaking free from the constraints of royalty; it's also a poignant exploration of her relationship with her mother, Queen Elinor, voiced by Emma Thompson. The dynamic between the two characters is at the core of the narrative, highlighting themes of understanding and acceptance.What makes Brave truly special is its empowering message: it champions the idea that bravery isn't just about heroic deeds; it's about embracing one's true self and making difficult choices. The film tackles themes of identity and the complexities of family relationships with both heart and humor. It encourages viewers, especially young girls, to forge their own paths and embrace their individuality.The soundtrack, composed by Patrick Doyle, complements the storytelling beautifully, enhancing the emotional weight of key scenes and adding to the overall atmosphere. The film's balance of lighthearted moments and deeper themes is executed with finesse, making it enjoyable for audiences of all ages.In conclusion, Brave is a remarkable film that combines stunning animation, a compelling story, and a powerful message about courage and self-discovery. It stands as a testament to Pixar's ability to create films that resonate on multiple levels, making it a must-watch for anyone who believes in the strength of their own voice.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

Thus, when the time comes for her to choose a husband from the other three clans, a huge argument occurs between her and her mother which is about to introduce a change in their relationship and even regarding the future of the kingdom, for better or worse.It's an animation which follows Merida, the young red-haired princess, who seems to love her bow and her freedom more than her kingdom, as she's about to face the biggest challenge of her life. Her whole world will be turned upside down after what looks like a disastrous mistake, so she'll have to rethink it all in an attempt to make things right.

Pixar's most conventional film,"This is one of the very few Pixar films where its influences are utterly obvious.

Indeed, Medira is such a Disney princess that she gets her own gag in Ralph Breaks the Internet. The central mother-daughter story is engaging and there's a lot of gorgeous vistas in the film but it all has been done before and usually better.

"""Brave"" Review","In ""Brave,"" Princess Merida attempts to break tradition by wishing for a spell that will change her fate. Unfortunately, this spell changes her mother, Queen Elinor, into a bear and Merida, realizing her mistake, must find a way to undo the curse before the kingdom destroys the DunBroch and before the second sunrise of the spell. This film is Pixar's first film with a female protagonist and its fairy tale, but it focuses more on the mother-daughter relationship, as opposed to romance from previous fairy tales. The three lords: Macintosh, Dingwall and MacGuffin play comic relief in this film, as their sons compete for Merida's hand in marriage. Merida's young triplet brothers also provide comic relief, constantly stealing cakes from the maid and the triplets themselves being turned into bear cubs.The animation and effects (particularly on the will-o'-the-wisps) are very well done, the music by Scottish composer Patrick Doyle is exciting and uplifting and the voice cast, including Kelly Macdonald, Billy Connolly, British actress Emma Thompson, etc. Is all authentically Scottish. This film is so detailed in its depiction of medieval Scotland in the 10th century that Pixar had to upgrade its animation system in order to depict the realism of the trees, clothing and the castle. Directors Mark Andrews and Brenda Chapman really ought to be given credit for this majestic piece of work, but this is essentially Chapman's movie from beginning to end. She originally developed this movie based on raising her feisty and rebellious daughter. Strangely enough, this movie also contains body humor, just like in the Shrek movies, but this humor is kept to a minimum in this movie.

Pure dead rubbish,"The animation was very impressive. However the storyline was tedious and frustrating. I am very disappointed that this film was billed as a fantastic and exciting plot. I really hope they do not make a sequel because I could not bare to sit through another version of the same story. I found the princess character annoying and selfish, this may be because I am older and perhaps young kids would empathise more with the central character. The advertising trailers for this film, captured the few highlights of this film and I would not recommend it to anyone.

"Conflict to Connection : Mother-Daughter Bonds In ""Brave"" Movie","Brave (2012) is a movie that follows a young Scottish princess named Merida, who
struggles with her relationship with her mother, Elinor. This pixar movie directed by Mark
Andrews and Brenda Chapman. This movie set in the Scottish Highlands. Merida's character
in this movie is depicted as a independent and adventurous woman, While her mother expects
her to conform to royal traditions, including a forced marriage. Merida's frustration with her
mother's expectations leads her to make a choice that change everything. Merida's seeks the
help of a witch to change her fate. However, the spell goes wrong, and Elinor turns into a bear.The movie highlighting the complexities of mother-daughter bonds and the importance of
mutual respect and understanding in overcoming generational differences.I deeply appreciate how the film potrays the emotional growth of both Merida and Elinor.One of the most powerful moments in their journey occurs when Merida takes responsibility
for the mess she has created and works together with her mother to undo the curse. They have
to work side by side to fight the danger. Their journey teaches me that understanding and
respecting each other's feelings can heal conflicts. As I can relate to their struggles in my own
life, I sometimes find myself wanting more freedom to make my own choices especially as i
get older and start thinking about my future. My mother is like Elinor, she often want to guide
me and protect me, even when i don't always agree with my mom advice. Over time, I've
learned that talking openly and listening to each other can help solve problems and bring us
closer.In Brave (2012), the relationship between Merida and her mother, Elinor, shows how
conflicts can be resolved through understanding, communication, and respect. By the end of
the movie, both characters learn to appreciate each other's perspectives, which deepens their
connection. This transformation in their relationship reminds us that, in real life, mother and
daughter conflicts are not unusual, but with patience and open communication, we can turn
misunderstandings into opportunities for growth and closer connections. Brave movie teaches us that love, respect, and understanding are key to building stronger, more supportive
relationships, no matter the differences we may face.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Fantastic Movie,"Strong Themes: Brave is one of Pixar's most character-driven films, focusing on the complex mother-daughter relationship between Merida and Queen Elinor. The film explores themes of independence, responsibility, and understanding others' perspectives, which are refreshing compared to typical fairy tale narratives.Stunning Animation: The animation is breathtaking, especially in its depiction of the rugged Scottish Highlands.

Och aye the noo!,"""Brave"" is pixars most un-ambitious film yet. Maybe after their long string off great movies the studio feel they no longer need to try. I (like most) have come to expect a lot from Pixars CGI animations, and (like most) was thoroughly disappointed with this one.I Suppose it doesn't help that I'm Scottish and found a majority off the films inevitable stereotypes way too overly familiar. I even had a bet with the friend I went to see the movie with, over how long it would take too see them all eating Haggis. And there the scene was, a mere 10 minutes in. Not that I found ""Brave"" overly offensive, it just totally lacked the imagination off many off Pixars other movies, and replaced it with everything you've already seen before in a Hollywood movie set in Scotland.This is not the only part off ""Brave"" that is lacking however. The story is also uninspired there's a lack off action, and the films attempts to be funny fall flat as often as they succeed. Ye, the animation is good (They seem to be loving the fact the main character has a mass off red curly bouncy hair) you'll maybe get some laughs out off this flick, and the ending will no doubt have some off the audience emotional. But by then it was too late for me.",4.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

"How is this movie ""inspirational""?","I watched the movie hoping it would be ""inspirational"" about gender roles, as the media claimed it was. Merida was supposed to be brave and independent as a heroine, so I was really excited when I finally got the chance to watch the film. Turns out, half of the film was dedicated to Merida whining about her mother and how she's so unhappy with being a princess. She even curses her mother, for heaven's sake. How the hell is this supposed to be inspirational? Because of the shock, that's the only element of the film that I remember the most. Yes, the punishment was that her mother turned into a bear, but the rest of the story turned to Merida rescuing her mother from the curse. Supposedly this film was supposed to represent feminism and inspire girls to choose their own paths, but all I took away from this film was that children should obey their parents. Sorry Brave fans, but Brave was a huge disappointment and Merida doesn't represent feminism in any way...Wait so what path did Merida take again? This wasn't even clear. And I can't even call her a heroine. She only seems like an ungrateful child who needs to learn how to obey her parents and if she is so unsatisfied with her life, she doesn't have to curse her own mother like that. All in all, Brave has the worst storyline compared to other Pixar and even Disney princess films.",2.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

A very average effort from Pixar,"Pixar isn't known for its films falling into the 'average' category. All of their films are extremely inventive and feel genuine, excluding the lacklustre Cars and its weak sequel. However, Brave is a distinctly middle of the road effort from Pixar and one that lacks their usual innovative spark. For all its imaginative animation and varied comedic moments, you can't help but feel that something is missing when taking in the film as a whole. Set in mythical Scotland, the adventurous Princess Merida is told that she must marry despite her grievances. She defies her mother's wishes, receiving a potion from a witch and their relationship is tested in an unexpected way when the mother is turned into a bear. The film originally looked like it was going to tackle the challenges that Merida must face, but it becomes more of a film about the connection between a mother and daughter.Now this could be fine if it's done well, but two of the films biggest issues lie in the story. Firstly, the story is very predictable. From the very beginning of the conflict you know what's going to happen and that they'll be an obvious resolution at end, which is never properly explained anyway. Secondly, Merida has no arch and she doesn't change as the film progresses. She starts out free-spirited and irresponsible then she ends up being exactly the same way at the conclusion. She doesn't learn or develop despite what takes place between her and Elinor, in fact I'd argue that Elinor has a lot more growth as a result. Merida also isn't an enjoyable character because she is far too whiny and uninteresting to ever be truly invested in. She just comes across as an insensitive teenager, she isn't funny or smart and she isn't nearly as courageous as she's built up to be.With that said I did like the other characters. Elinor remains very dignified and likable despite all that she is put through. Fergus is an enjoyable king and gets plenty of laughs for his energetic behaviour, while having Billy Connolly voice him was smart idea. The Witch is more of a modern, fast-talker and she is amusing despite her limited appearance in all fairness. The three lords are all colourful and great fun, creating an entertaining sense of rivalry and providing most of the laughs. As a matter of fact the film does have a good sense of humour which is one of its strong points. The comedy is well varied, the slapstick is very well done and the majority of the jokes are at least amusing. Going back to the story, one thing that was good about it was the mother's mind becoming more bear-like over time, which was a nice twist and kept a tension that was badly needed.The animation is very impressive once again. It's always nice to see Pixar tackle different places and medieval Scotland was a smart choice. A real sense of wonder and majesty was crafted simply from the visuals alone, the landscapes look beautiful and even the designs on the characters (such as Merida's distinctive hair) are so detailed. The Scottish folklore was really enjoyable and created a strong atmosphere which makes it such a shame so little of it was used because certainly it would have made things much more interesting had it been developed. Patrick Doyle deserves credit for his distinctive score, it carries that Celtic sound thanks to the strong use of bagpipes but it also has many gripping melodies and does create a good backdrop for the images. In contrast, there is a lack of emotional connection throughout the film and that's something Pixar usually excels at. I found myself not caring about any of the characters or where the film was going to end up, which turned it into a dull experience at times and especially during the middle section.So for all of Brave's great technical aspects, it is let down where it truly matters with its story and main character. The story is so by-the-book and predictable that it's so difficult to be engaged by the journey it undertakes, it takes no risks and pushes no boundaries. It doesn't help when you have a dull lead because Merida is very boring to follow and as said she doesn't grow as a character. The film does have positives because the side characters, animation and score are all very good. Yet because this is from a studio as talented as Pixar we're always going to expect something great because they're fully capable of producing it. In a way it's disappointing more than anything else because the film did have so much potential and it will simply go down as a noticeably ordinary Pixar effort.",5.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

Braved enough to watch it.,"The first Disney/Pixar movie to be set in a period time takes us to the journey of Princess Merida of Scotland, who doesn't want to follow tradition and marry a son of a suitor right away, against the wishes of her mother, Queen Elinor. Instead, she wants to follow her own path as an aspiring archer. Merida's personality is like that of a rebellious teenager who doesn't want to listen to her mother and, instead, thinks her own thoughts are what's best, regardless of the consequences - irritating to say the least and sends the wrong message to the youth. Her constant back and forth quarrels in resisting her mother's plea to follow-through with tradition on finding a suitor consumed much of the movie's intro and was boring. However, some excitement kicks in when Merida inadvertently brings a curse upon her family after striking a deal with a witch; thereby, forcing her to set on a mission to make things right.The animation reminded me of a mystical setting which I thought wasn't very colorful, but detailed. I enjoyed the Scottish-flavored music score and the special effects for the film as well. The characters, on the other hand, weren't very memorable for the most part. Much of the adult male characters were clueless, idiotic ruffians, the little triplets were conniving, mischievous thieves and Merida's impetuous and selfish personality went a little overboard. There were a little redeeming qualities in some of them in the second half of the film, though.Overall, it's not one of the better Pixar movies as it's not very magic, unpredictable and awe-inspiring as others.Grade D+",5.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

Worth the embarrassment and deserves small round of applause,"I entered the cinema to watch Brave with low expectations. I had heard in reviews that it wasn't PIXAR's best movie and the plot didn't look very exciting. However, I was pleasantly surprised by this movie; especially the first half. I found that PIXAR brought the characters to life and built up their stories. Another surprise was the beautiful soundtrack. I was expecting a poor Hollywood take on Celtic music. Instead, I was treated to a spectacular traditional Scottish sound experience with gorgeous vocals by Julie Fowlis. With this added to the stunning graphics and CGI landscape made a spectacular scene and opening half of this movie. But I had heard that there was a huge plot twist mid-way through this movie. I didn't yet know what the twist was but I had heard that, unfortunately, it made this movie......... a kids' movie. So, by the start of the second half of this movie, I was feeling slightly anxious about this plot twist. Suddenly, it dawned on me what the plot twist was. I was resisting the urge to scream out my disappointment in PIXAR and...............Then I realised that it actually wasn't too bad. No, actually, it was great. This plot twist was a humorous surprise that was extremely entertaining and was pulled off well.This movie is definitely not PIXAR's best film but is one that sends the company in a new direction. Hopefully, there will be no Toy Story 4 but instead a new PIXAR fairy-tale. If PIXAR can keep on producing new but nevertheless entertaining stories then there is no need for half-hearted sequels. Admittedly, some sequels have paid off but Disney may not want to take that risk again too many times.Brave is a spectacular film full of magical music, great graphics and creative characters. This hilarious and stunning tale has earned itself a 9/10 and small round of applause. *clap*clap*clap* It also made up for the fact that my friend and I were the only teenagers there!",5.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

The clunky bears are not frightening when they need to be or endearing when they try to be. The look of the film is dull and clichéd along with redundant flourishes (like the witch in the cauldron straight out of A.I. (Dr.Know).It is not a total bomb but is forgettable silliness and routine rowdiness. There is very little suspense and even the youngsters will most likely get bored.
