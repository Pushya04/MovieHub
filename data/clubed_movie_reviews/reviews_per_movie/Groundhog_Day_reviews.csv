I got you babe,"It's 2019 and I still watch this movie from time to time, feels like 6am all over again. I've seen a few copy-cat movies borrowing the same 'repeats' but it's just not the same or memorable.The humor is charming and intelligent, great lines, characters and can even make you fall in love with the town. The scene with the old man always gets to me, you really feel for all the characters. I can watch this over and over.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
A Soul Reclaimed,"This movie is so charming. It starts out with Phil Connor, the Bill Murray character, doing his Bill Murray. Cynicism emanating from every pore. He is harsh, disinterested, angry, full of angst. Making jokes about everything. Everybody knows it. Everybody feels it. When the ""gift"" or ""curse"" comes to him to relive the same day over and over, he at first is confused, then flippant, then angry, then suicidal, and, finally, sees it as a chance to reclaim his humanity. This is done in a series of repetitious acts which ultimately lead to his willingness to sacrifice himself, live for the day, and try to show that he is worth saving. What this movie does, like ""It's a Wonderful Life,"" is ask us what we would do, given the same circumstances. Would we fall into a retreat of depression? Would we become something that we always wanted to be? Would we keep living it the same way, hoping for he best? Murray's character wants the romance and the commitment that he was never willing to give. He toys with his own approach to the world, experimenting and doing things until he gets them right. He goes through a period of embracing the bad, lusting after Andy MacDowell, forcing himself on the other women in the town, disdaining the ""characters"" he meets. But like most ""everymen,"" he eventually must become good because without that, it doesn't matter anymore.He can only impress so much; he can only be angry so long. I find this movie so intriguing, not for what it says but for what it teaches. Some don't like the ending, but whatever the forces are that bring it about, it has to be. If we accept that premise, it's OK.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
It's just what life is all about.,"My brother told me that some people say ""ground hog"" day is one of the most spiritual movies ever made. First times I watched the movie ( I already have seen it a dozen times) I just laughed about it. But after some times watching I saw what the director wanted to say with it.In my own life the same thing happened but not as heavy as in the movie. I mean, in my life the day just become another day. ( really I ask myself, the only thing that was different that was the date) I think a lot of people live in groundhog day, doing the same thing again and again, not taking the best out of life. Just living without any consciousness. Not having enough time by their own fault, because time is a thing you can offer yourself by making other choices.Groundhog day....I personally am getting rid of that day more and more fortunately and finally too. More and more I am trying to make best of life and using every day in another way.I am not crazy. No, I just watch movies with some kind of view lately. In every movie there is a hidden message told.Enough about Ground Hog day....I gave the movie an 8 because the number 8 is the number of eternity. And that's also a thing the movie is about. About eternity and not about the bad and boring repeating of the stupid livings.Danny",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
Every time is like the first time,"It's been 6 or even 7 years since I watched this masterpiece. Possibly, you would argue: 'Hey, if it is a excellent movie, what is Titanic, The Godfather and The Shawshank Redemption?"" Well, if you are still not bored after a hundred views, it is perfect movie for you. And it holds for me. Easy, but important idea is the key of everything. This is love we all want in our lives.

Neglected Masterpiece,"I thought the film was terrific when I saw it in theaters twelve years ago. Recently in watching it again on cable, I was amazed at the quality of the screenplay. I didn't notice the first time. But on repeated viewings (like reliving Groundhog Day), I was impressed at the story created by the writers. This film is so much more than witty jokes and comic riffs arranged around a gimmick. It has an internal logic and consistency that is very rarely found in screenplays. No joke seemed disposable, and as you laugh your way along, the philosophy underlying the film takes over your imagination.Check the IMDb listings for this film's awards: look at the numerous British awards for writing. And yet this film was not even nominated for an Oscar. It is so rare that a film's jokes seem just as fresh more than a decade later, but I believe that is because the theme underlying the humor will never go out of fashion.The acting was terrific, and I now think this is Bill Murray's best work (though I didn't take it seriously when I first saw the film.) But the screenplay is the one of the finest ever written. I don't know if it's studied in film schools, but it ought to be.* * * * *ON HAROLD RAMIS' DEATH: Ramis told The Associated Press in a 2009 story about the 50th anniversary of Second City. ""When you hit it right, those things last.""I found that quote in a story on Ramis' death. The story curiously did not mention ""Groundhog Day."" If there is any film to serve as a fitting memorial for Harold Ramis, it must be ""Groundhog Day."" A totally perfect script, perfectly executed. He hit it right, and when will he get the recognition he deserved decades ago?",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
Movies can change lives,"Often you hear the adage, ""It is just a film"". Well, for most times it is true. But on rarest of rare occasions, it isn't. This was one of them. Like a great piece literature, painting, poetry, speech it has the capacity to change the way you feel and think. It is the biggest compliment I can pay to a film. I rank Groundhog Day with Seventh Seal, Wild Strawberries, Waking Life, Synecdoche New York, Tokyo Story, Ikiru as one of the moves that has the capacity to change.It is anything but a preachy film as the ""intro"" to the review might suggest. In fact it an extremely entertaining and funny film with one of the best performances ever by Bill Murray. The plot revolves around a weather man (Bill Murray) is reluctantly sent to cover a story about a weather forecasting ""rat"" (as he calls it). This is his fourth year on the story, and he makes no effort to hide his frustration. On awaking the 'following' day he discovers that it's Groundhog Day again, and again, and again. First he uses this to his advantage, then comes the realization that he is doomed to spend the rest of eternity in the same place, seeing the same people do the same thing every day.The challenge here for the makers was in terms of screenplay, editing and performances. Bear in mind that, the ""loops"" Bill Murray's character goes through, might become redundant for the audience after a while. This is where the genius of Harold Ramis and Bill Murray comes into play, who seem to introduce a ""novelty"" factor with every shot of the same sequence. I couldn't think of any actor other than Murray who could have pulled this one off.It is a movie likely to deceive you in its effortless narrative and casual comic tone. Yes, it is funny, but make no mistake about it, it is a film with a strong philosophical undertone. This is a quality that separates Groundhog from rest of the movies with similar intent. It tells you what it intends to on your terms. It deals with the questions that bother us for a better part of our lives i.e. meaning of life, purpose of life, existentialism, death, god but never preaches, nor propels any propaganda. But by the end of it, you know that something has changed, something you didn't see coming has happened. And then you watch it again only to realize the moment of Epiphany that eluded you the first time.Every time I am down or losing perspective this is the movie that eases everything and makes me ask a simple question, ""What is important?"". One of the absolute great films of the 90s, but more than just a film for me.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
Bill Murray magic,"A fantastic idea for a movie and the part played by Bill could not have been better cast, his persona and facial expressions are just perfect.the only bad comment i have of this movie would be that the morals of the movie at the ending are so predictable and so Americanized, they should have just left him there day after day just going round in circles would have been awesome or for that fact multiple endings you choose the one you want. The supporting cast just superb with all members putting in excellent performances backing Bill up with just impeccable comedy timing, probably with some help from the director, maybe not.

Groundhog Day Keep Giving,"Groundhog Day is an interesting idea and Bill Murray is well cast for this part, as it needs his particular blend of unsentimental performance so that it doesn't become too sweet and cloying. One can't help but also put themselves in his shoe and imagine how each of us would react if unexpectedly found ourselves in this same situation. Sure, there a romance moving many of the levers here but its balanced by ample levity to keep it honest. The whole cast is pretty solid, including the groundhog. I'm not loving Groundhog Day to the degree that many people seem to, but still its a solid film worth checking out.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
Rewatchability,"Once you watch it, you'll wanna watch it again asap. And then again!! Yes, Groundhog Day is probably the most rewatchable movie ever made, and gets better each time.

Near classic,"Groundhog Day is one of those movies you wish you could remake.  This is not a criticism - it is a complement.  The movie is based on such a powerful thematic idea - that of reliving a day over and over again until you get it right - that it deservers to become the kind of classic story, like A Christmas Carol, that is remade periodically every few years to see what a different cast and director can make of it.For instance, the movie is in the comedy/drama/romance genres, but I felt the comedy should have given way a bit more clearly to drama when the emotional turning point is reached; but the point is that I cared enough about the idea to be interested in thinking about improving its execution. I thought about the movie quite a bit, in fact, and that is exceedingly rare for me.  I think the theme is good enough for doctoral dissertations and certainly Sunday sermons.And I keep finding myself humming ""The Pennsylvania Polka"".",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
Lightweight comedy which becomes patronising and unfunny.,"What should be a winning formula, with Ramis directing and Murray starring, manages to turn into one long drag.Murray plays a cynical TV Weatherman, reporting in a small town on their Groundhog Day celebrations. He finds himself stuck there, reliving the same day over and over again, and therefore able to manipulate the events he knows are coming.If this had remained a straight comedy things may have worked, but the film decides to cloak itself in a social message aura and tries to make some far-reaching preachy comments. What life was in the basic premise soon wears thin and the film drags itself along for the remaining hour or so.The film seems to be universally admired so maybe I'm not enlightened enough to fully appreciate it. It presumably has an element which hits a nerve with a certain audience - with me it didn't just miss the mark, it missed the entire block.",5.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
Loved this movie growing up,"I don't know what it was about that movie that made it so memorable, but I think I have seen it 500 times. It is really one of those movies that will stay with you throughout the years. I think we have all wanted to be able to go back and re-do a day or two in our lives until we get it right. I love that there is a happy ending. Bill Murray is a comic genius in my mind and it always entertaining to watch. I think I was about 7 when this movie came out and I was one of those kids that would watch a movie on repeat for weeks on end and this was one of my favorites. I think this movie truly stands the test of time. I wish I could say the same for half the movies that have been released in the last five years.

Perfect!,"It's kind of hard to pinpoint what makes 'Groundhog Day' work just right- many movies have great premises, some even a bit more ambitious than this one (though not as heartfelt, maybe) but fail. I think that 'ratedness' may play a bigger role than people imagine. For example, this movie came out a bit before my time, and because of that I missed the trailers and stuff for when the film came out. Even so, people that were around when 'Groundhog' came out in the theatres, might've also thought it was underrated, as the title 'Groundog Day' doesn't necessarily *try* to draw in huge crowds.OK...all my above rambling means one thing: I loved 'Groundhog Day', but I'm embarrassed I didn't watch it sooner. Having the typical Generation X-er mentality I assumed this film would have outdated humour- but let me assure you (and seeing Rushmore confirmed this for me) -Bill Murray and his humour will NEVER go out of style; he is fabulous. He takes just the right amount of self-deprication (not too much) and combines it with cynicism....well I don't want to try to *define* his humour- the easiest way would be to watch him in action! Also, the writing for this film is absolutely perfect.Go see for yourselves...  and hope that ONE DAY the groundhog will actually NOT see his shadow......lol",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
One to watch over and over again,"'Groundhog Day' is right up there with the best work Bill Murray has ever done, and it's also one of the best comedies ever made too.The plot is simple, and yet complex at the same time. Bill Murray's character goes on a journey to become a better man, doing some pretty dark things along the way, and yet we as an audience go along with it and will him to do well.There are lots of lovely moments throughout, with the comedy being intertwined with drama and poignancy perfectly.I highly suggest that you watch this film, because it is one that's message stays with you long after the final credits.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"

When the gods wish to punish us...,"In Harold Ramis's ""Groundhog Day"" (1993), an intriguing comedy about repeating the past, Bill Murray is Phil Connors, an arrogantly self-centered and cynical TV weatherman, sent for the fifth time to the small town of Punxsutawney, PA to cover the Groundhog ceremony held every February 2nd. He stumbles into a time warp and winds up repeating the same day over and over again until forced to look at himself from the distance and to examine his attitude.I love this movie  not only it is one of the best, most original, clever and funniest comedies I've seen, it also makes you think of the serious questions. For instance, when Gods want to punish a mean, arrogant SOB, they would not take his sanity away  they will make the whole world around him mad and let him deal with the situation. Or another question, what would you do if you have eternity on your hands? Is it a curse or blessing?Groundhog Day does not reuse tired and stupid jokes; its humor comes from the situations and characters. Bill Murray was born to play Phil Connors and movie uses his talent as a comedian to the fullest. I think it was the best role Murray ever played. His character has gone through transformation before our eyes, and it was very convincing.9.5/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
"Ingenious concept, enthusiastically presented.","Bill Murray can be a very funny guy, especially when given roles where his character has a deliciously cruel edge. He has one of those faces, and a voice to go with it, which can make nastiness and sarcasm funny. Groundhog Day is a highly enjoyable vehicle for Murray's talents. It also has a very clever concept, neatly brought to the screen by actor-turned-director Harold Ramis (who starred alongside Murray in the Ghostbusters films).Pittsburgh weather-man Phil Connors (Bill Murray) is sent on assignment to Punxatawney, where on Groundhog Day each year the locals have a tradition of consulting the groundhog to find out if spring is imminent or if they should prepare for 6 more weeks of winter. Phil despises the job and the town, and can't wait to get it over with.... even though he has a soft spot for Rita (Andie MacDowell), the producer overseeing his broadcast. Phil's dislike of Punxatawney, its people and its traditions is set to get a hell of a lot worse though.... as when he awakens the next morning he finds himself reliving the same day. And so it goes - every time Phil gets up, it's still February 2nd and he seems destined to be stuck in the same day for the rest of eternity.It seems early on in the proceedings that the film might run out of steam and inspiration. After all, how can a film about a day which repeats itself be anything but repetitive? Thankfully, Groundhog Day is full of ingenious ideas, and it successfully throws up new developments and delightful twists at every opportunity. The film is laced with memorable dialogue, and Murray gets to play one of the defining roles of his career as a facetious, sharp-tongued misanthrope who ultimately learns the error of his ways. Groundhog Day is a very good film indeed, and restores one's faith in the imagination still lurking beneath the dismayingly shallow surface of Hollywood.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
Beauty & the Murray...,"For all intents and purpose Bill Murray plays the role of the beast in a time looped reprisal of Beauty & the Beast. I fancy however, had the beast in the original tale had a potentially perpetual number of goes at winning the girl over and he had access to Rohypnol the story told would be anything but a fairy tale - fortunately that isn't the case here as Bill Murray is equipped with a veritable tool store of innovative, hilarious, wacky and inspiring methods to win the girl over. There are plenty of other valuable takeaways, not the least a caustic appraisal of the modern world and how it can affect us but let's not get too serious - few people have ever had the ability to pull stuff off like this and, for it to remain as entertaining and as fresh as the day it was released, makes Bill Murray one of those few people.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
A Truly Great Romantic Comedy,"One of the great films, ""Groundhog Day"" is a satisfying romantic comedy that also works as an exploration of existential and philosophical concepts.Phil (Bill Murray) is a Pittsburgh weatherman who must cover the Groundhog Day festivities for the fourth year in a row. He reluctantly travels to Puxatawney, PA with cameraman Larry (Chris Elliott) and new producer Rita (Andie MacDowell) to record the antics of Puxatawney Phil. After they get there, he is caught in a time loop, making him relive February 2nd over and over.Before he goes to Puxatawney, Phil is tired of his boring life. To him, it feels like everyday is the same--more clouds, more precipitation, more cold fronts. He is abrasively sarcastic and genuinely depressed.When he is forced to live a life where literally everyday is essentially the same, he learns to appreciate the small things. And he realizes that he is the primary variable in his own life; it is up to him to appreciate the little things and to make the most of his time.The script is terrific. Not only does it hold together on scrutiny, it is touching and funny. Bill Murray straddles the line between humorous and meanness perfectly, affecting a transformation that is believable. Andie MacDowell does a good job portraying a woman who is essentially romantic and optimistic, but wary of Phil's intentions. Chris Elliott is self-deprecating and perfectly tuned to his role as an immature schlub.I know I am not alone in saying I have watched ""Groundhog Day"" so many times I have lost count. Its appeal is so great, it easily bears rewatching, like ""The Wizard of Oz"". In my estimation, Bill Murray has two of the top comedies of our time with ""Groundhog Day"" and ""What About Bob?""",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"

Normals don't get the girl,"What this movie basically says is that if you can play the piano like a pro, be a professional ice carver, get 6 different couples to congratulate you for changing their life including being a medical professional, and demonstrate all of this in front of the woman you like, then and only then will she fall for you.It's one thing that Phil becomes a better human but it's bitter sweet because Rita doesn't just need a nice person. She needs Superman. She buys him only because he's beyond amazing.I don't actually remember the details of ""Green Card"" and I'm not saying it's as good a movie but as far as I remember, Brontë (MacDowell), falls for Georges as a normal person, not as the most accomplished person someone has ever met.It's that part that robs the Groundhog Day of some impact.

Cheap laughs and over-sentimentality wrapped up in an interesting concept,"Some of the more profound implications of the scenario were unfortunately scrapped to play to a mainstream audience. Though in the surface a good vehicle for Bill Murray, the cons outweigh the pros.There is at least one implication of the scenario overlooked by almost everyone: namely if Bill Murray lives the same day over and over then what happens to everyone else in the world? The only possible solution to this, considering no one else is living it over and over (that we know of), is the many worlds theory. So each new twist of the day creates a new scenario that of course gets played out in the universe that the film's Phil doesn't get to see. So when Phil commits suicide, he really DOES die in that alternate world. And each Phil goes onto the next day with everyone else in the world. So what's happening obviously is his MEMORIES of reliving the same day with different scenarios keep building up more and more.So how do these memories get transmuted back to him each 6AM on February 2nd? The original script explained it as a former girlfriend casting a spell on him. In reincarnation theory what dies isn't consciousness, but memory, and some anecdotes exist of those who recall past lives. So what could account for Phil? Somehow the spell would have to stop the death of memory so he not only keeps remembering the future 24 hours, but remembers all the OTHER future 24 hours. The writer estimated 10 years worth, though the original script called for 10,000 years worth of Feb. 2s, which as you can imagine would make this that much more hellish. The fact that Phil starts out each day the same physically shows that the only thing caught in the time loop is his memory.Now, much of the dialogue is strictly cheap laughs (""ever had Deja Vu?"" ""I'll see if it's on the menu"" and such). But as far as any overall message it gets lost in over-sentimentality, especially at the end. The message is suppose to be that we must keep repeating things until we get them right; problem is the way Phil chooses to get things right is to YES, use tricks to get what he wants, which is Rita (Andie MacDowell).The first night he gets her home she is wise to him, but the last he so utilizes the tricks as to impress her beyond belief. Remember that close to t helast night he tells her the truth of how he knows so much, but NOT the last ""perfect"" day. On THAT day he basically lies to her by impressing her WITHOUT telling her the reason he is able to do so. So actually the film's moral reads: become a master of deceit to get what you want.If the film took the more profound path instead of playing to the mainstream it would have been a great film. As it is it a mediocre comedy with a twist.",4.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
This movie gets better every time I see it,"I just read somewhere that the Internet is full of philosophers and religions that have adopted this movie as their favorite parable. I'm not surprised, but that's not the reason I love it.This movie starts with a premise that could be light, silly, trite, or promising but disappointing. Through deft writing and Murray's amazing comic timing, it manages to be none of those. The movie just keeps getting better the longer you watch it, and every silliness comes with a bit of serious thinking behind it.Take home from this movie: A visceral awareness of what really matters in life, and how your own attitude in it is really everything there is. Not just mostly... entirely everything.This movie threatens at first to go on forever, but after a while I wished it would. It compresses the lesson of ""It's a Wonderful Life"" into its first act, and then improves continually from there. I honestly can't think of how this movie could be improved.To see how bad this movie *could* have been, watch ""Multiplicity"" with Michael Keaton. Then watch ""Groundhog Day"" again and enjoy.

So many films have spun this exact theme, the time loop, but none has bettered or even matched this great film.It does everything so well, it makes you laugh, it makes you cry, it delivers on all counts, you see Phil genuinely develop and progress as a character, the man at the end is world's apart from the one that set the ball rolling.The acting is great all round, but Murray is just magical, he really does make you sympathise and empathise with Phil, you feel the torment, hope, despair and even the mischief.It's almost thirty years old, and it's still awesome, 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
The Overlooked Gem that Deserved a Best Picture Nomination,"A Capra-esque piece of serio-comic fantasy, ""Groundhog Day"" was rightly hailed by critics and the public in 1993, and subsequently robbed of a Best Picture nomination in the year of ""Schindler's List,"" ""In the Name of the Father"" and ""The Piano."" Was ""The Fugitive"" REALLY a better movie than this extrememly clever, heartfelt film?  I don't think so.Bill Murray was perfect as Phil Connors, and watching his character evolve from smarmy misanthrope to playful Don Juan to a hopeless suicide case to a true romantic is a joy.

The good actor/director Harold had a long career that began in 1969 , it spans over forty years , starting when he joined Chicago's Second City's Improvisational Theatre Troupe before moving to New York to help write and perform in ""The National Lampoon Show"" with other Second City graduates including John Belushi, Gilda Radner and Bill Murray . By 1976, he was head writer and a regular performer on the top Canadian comedy series Second City TV (1976). His Hollywood debut came when he collaborated on the script for National Lampoon's Animal House (1978) which was produced/directed by Ivan Reitman . After that, he worked as writer with Ivan as producer on Meatballs (1979), Stripes (1981), Ghostbuster (1984) and Ghostbusters II (1989) and acted in the latter three. Rating Groundhog Day(1993) : 7.5/10 , it is quirky funny in vaguely olf-fashioned style . Better than average , worthwhile watching. The pic will appeal to Bill Murray and Andie MacDowell fans.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
Incredibly deep and also hilarious,"""Groundhog Day"" is another example of a movie that deserved multiple nominations (and wins) at the Academy Awards. At the time, it was often dismissed as a light fantasy-comedy. But actually Danny Rubin and Harold Ramis wrote an incredibly intelligent, heartwarming, and funny script, and Bill Murray put in the performance of his lifetime.Phil Connors, played by Murray, is having a bad day. A nearly infinite amount of times. I don't believe the story that the movie takes place over 10 years of reliving the same day; it's clearly implied that it's A LOT more than that, and that's what the screenwriter originally had intended anyway. And this is where the brilliance of both the script and Murray's performance lies; we're not watching the same thing over and over again, because we have as a focal point Phil, who's reliving the day and reacting to it differently each time. The stages he goes through until he finally learns to accept it and try to make something of it are interesting. By the end of the movie he's reached something akin to nirvana, where every move he makes is perfect, and thus he's finally allowed to move on.We never get an explanation of why this is happening, which only heightens our fascination of it. It seems implied by the ending that something divine is going on; Phil really seems to reach perfection, a state of being, perhaps, a perfect human being, or as close to it as we can get, and that's where the timescale becomes apparent; think how long it would take to achieve such a thing! And all this is masked at first appearance by all the humor going on. At first glance, it really appears to be a screwball comedy (and even as such, it's laugh-out-loud funny), and you can't see the brilliance behind everything. It's a nearly perfect movie, and it's one of my favorites.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
"Funny, imaginative and good-natured comedy","Weatherman Phil Connors (Bill Murray) is sent to cover the annual Groundhog Day Event in which a Groundhog is used to predict what kind of weather is to be expected. Phil is generally cynical about this event and vows that this will be the last year that he'll be covering the event. However, after 'covering' the event Phil wakes up at 6 o'clock the next morning (and every morning thereafter) and finds himself living the same day over and over again.On paper, Groundhog Day really shouldn't have worked anywhere near as well as it did. The premise of having a weatherman reliving the same day over and over again could have been a monotonous bore in the wrong hands, but Ramis and co really make the most of the premise meaning that it generally works well on every level.I think what makes this film works so well is that the writers really went to town in an attempt to explore as many possibilities (both good and bad) of living each day exactly the same as the previous one. As a result of living the same day every day Phil inevitably goes through various emotional stages - denial, anger, frustration, depression, acceptance. Each aspect of the story is handled well by Ramis and co and no aspect stays longer than is necessary.The script is good here, but so too are the performances from MacDowell and Murray. Murray has the difficult task of taking his character through each of the various emotional stages and gives a very convincing performance throughout. MacDowell is also good, but she isn't given quite as much to work with. Together though,their chemistry was fantastic and given the journey that they'd shared together I actually found myself believing in their blossoming romance (this is coming from someone who normally gags when they watch anything romantic). Groundhog Day also has a lot of heart to it as well and for this reason it is a very likable film.As well as all of the above and perhaps most importantly the film also remembers to have lots of fun with its imaginative premise - the scene where Phil was driving with the Groundhog was genius. Whilst this film is never laugh out loud funny there were still plenty of amusing moments.Are there any problems here? Well yes, but they are only minor.... The central plot sees Phil living the same day as the last and whilst it is very funny for the most part actually seeing the same scenes being repeated over and over again does get a bit tedious at times - although there are slight variances in each of the repetitions so it's not a major problem. The insurance guy was also really annoying, but he's only in a couple of scenes so again this wasn't a major problem.It's a testament to Ramis and Co as writers that they've managed to create a film about a man living a seemingly monotonous existence and flesh it out to create a charming, funny, imaginative and rather insightful piece of work. Not many films leave me with a smile on my face at the end, but this one did.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
Pseudo-philosophy,"I enjoyed this film when I first saw it as a child. Bill Murray is great, and the idea of being stuck in the same day is a fun premise.And then I saw it again recently. And again. And I actually started pondering what was going on in the film.And you know what? It's a delightful film, but it is also rubbish in terms of philosophy.Apparently Bill Murray has to spend an eternity bettering himself so he can deserve Andie MacDowell. But what does she have to do? Apparently nothing. Let me tell you something: If Murray became such a wonderful human being, he would have no interest in that selfish, self- obsessed, insipid tart. I mean, look at that woman: She imagines to be a morally superior princess that no one deserves. That is how she justifies the fact that she is still single. She proceeds to toast to 'world peace' and imagine to be a mother to a bunch of children, but in reality she'd probably divorce the poor bastard she married before they could even have a child. This is one cold woman and it doesn't even take a single day of self-improvement to figure that out.So not only is this film illogical, it is misandric.I give it two stars: one for Bill Murray and one for the hog.",2.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
Excellent comedy that anyone can relate to.,"Bill Murray plays Phil Connors, a weatherman for a local news station. Every year he goes to Puxatawney, Pennsylvania for the Puxatawney Phil event: commonly recognized as Groundhog Day. You know how it goes. The groundhog comes out. If it sees its shadow, it's six more weeks of winter. If it doesn't, it's spring.Well, the only problem about going to this event every year for Phil is that he hates it. He hates the cheery people. The little town. The weather. The event. The story. Everything. He hates it. He is a lonely, desolate, forsaken soul. With a great cynical side.Andie McDowell plays a new manager--err, womanager :)--who goes with Phil to the event, along with Chris Elliot, the cameraman. Phil reports, they tape it, it's a done deal. The end. Phil goes back home. Only one problem. Due to severe weather, the roads have all been closed, leaving only one option: Stay in Puxatawney until the storm blows over. So, Phil heads back to his cheery hotel, and tucks in for a dreaded nap. But when he wakes the next morning, something odd happens. The day is the exact same day as before. It is Groundhog Day. Again. Phil panics as he finds everything exactly the same as it was the day before. He knows everything that is going to happen. He shrugs it off as a weird case of deja-vu and heads back to sleep. But when he wakes up, alas! The day is...yesterday. Again. Technically.So Phil comes to terms with the fact that there is now way out of this small little town. He tries everything. He steps in front of a moving car. He electrocutes himself. He jumps off a building. All to no avail. Oh, he dies, all right. But the next day he's back and it's Groundhog Day again.Part of what makes ""Groundhog Day"" so excellent is the story. The characters and actors alone are great enough to recommend this movie, but the truth is, I cannot think of a better story to throw someone like Bill Murray into. He uses his smart-alecky ways to a new extreme. His character is a bit like Scrooge from the tale ""A Christmas Story,"" which is ironic, because Murray was in a parody on Scrooge's tale called ""Scrooged."" Anyway. Bill Murray is perfect as the irreverent and cynical Phil. Everything he does he carries out with a dumb, ""I'm-smarter-than-you"" face. He thinks himself better than everyone else. He thinks he is smart by skipping the big Holiday ordeal. It is all so stupid to him. But, as this story teaches us, having an attitude like that can get you in big trouble.Harold Ramis, director of ""Analyze This,"" star of ""Stripes,"" directed ""Groundhog Day."" Bill and he are old pals, and it sure shows. I bet they had a great time making this movie. But what is good about it is that while making a fun movie they didn't forget to come up with an interesting and audience-catching tale.Another thing that is great about ""Groundhog Day"" is that Phil Connors does what we would do. For example: When he finds out he has this ability to repeat the same day over and over, he does things the average person would do. The human weakness. Too many comedies with the same formula don't try to exploit this human weakness, but ""Groundhog Day"" does. We see Phil memorize the steps to successfully robbing an armored truck filled with cash. But the reason he can go to bed with a clear conscience is because he knows the next day that everything will be back to normal again. He will never have robbed the truck, never have bought a Ferarri, etc. Phil does what WE would do, and that is one importance aspect of ""Groundhog Day."" I would never rob an armored truck, but if I was stuck living the same day over and over, it would do no harm to take the cash - it would be back in the truck in the morning! So, I might do that. (although my conscience would still get in the way.) There was a little comedy with John Candy named ""Delirious."" It was about a soap opera writer getting trapped in his own world. And everything he writes on his typewriter comes true. While the movie was good, and pretty interesting, there were so many things Candy could have done with the ability to create and control any - and every- thing, and he didn't do them. I think that's where ""Groundhog Day"" steps in, filling in the blanks. There's nothing I love more than watching a comedy where the main character divulges into the human nature - in other words, I love watching the character do something the average human would do when given the power(s). And that's exactly what Phil does in ""Groundhog Day."" And that is why, among other things, it is one of my favorites.5/5 stars",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
Delightful film with great performances and a surprisingly refreshing concept,"Groundhog Day is a wonderful movie. Essentially it is a one-joke comedy, but what makes Groundhog Day so delightful is that whereas it could have been derivative and predictable, the film is always full of life and full to the brim with fresh ideas. The script is a delight, always funny, quotable and witty, while the story has a surprisingly refreshing concept and several great scenes.The cinematography is beautiful, and the locations and production values are consistently striking. Also Harold Ramis's direction is excellent, the pace rarely lags and all the characters are credible. The acting is wonderful too, and by far one of the best assets of this film. Bill Murray gives one of the best performances of his career, Stephen Tabolowsky gives a superb turn as the nerdy insurance salesman and the lovely Andie McDowell has never been better.In conclusion, a delightful film that works on all levels. 10/10 Bethany Cox",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"

A long day in Punxsutawney,"Like Phil who's reliving the same day over and over again, I've watched this movie many times and it always manages to put a smile on my face. My favorite aspect is the comedy. Bill Murray obviously as the star. I always loved his comedic style in 80s/90s movies. But all the other characters were funny too.Time travel is one of my favorite topics in movies so this made me like the movie more. It's not that concerned with the science aspect but mostly about the main character's way of dealing with his odd new reality. There's a lot of romance and drama. Giving this movie depth but it does always try to remain lighthearted. A great feel good movie and one my favorite movies of all-time.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
A fantastic character study,"I was interested in seeing this film because I was curious what they were going to do with its plot. There is a lot you can do with a plot like this and I was interested to know which directions the movie was going to go in. I was very proud of the angle the movie went in. After watching it, I can safely say that it is one of the best comedies from the past 25-30 years.A weatherman finds himself living the same day, Groundhog Day, over and over again. He is the only one who seems to know that it is happening. After he adjusts to it, he tries different things such as finding a love interest, meeting new people, doing illegal activities, helping out people, and trying to figure out how to stop it from going on.Instances he encounters on that day which keeps on getting repeated include: meeting a friendly former classmate who is trying to sell him insurance, doing a news report on the event of the ""Groundhog Day"" which he finds to be stupid and pointless, and experiencing a snow blizzard which traps him in a town. He is also very rude to his co-workers: Rita and Larry. He dislikes his job, his colleagues, and himself most of all.However, he learns that in order for the event to stop: he may have to change his normal way of life. Over the course of the days, he discovers his love for Rita and his desire to be with her. He also learns to be more kind to other people and he gets to know and help out people around town that he wouldn't have been introduced to had the events in the film had never have taken place. The event makes him learn to love himself and others. It's a very interesting idea a film could use for representing a change in a characters personality.Another great thing in the film is that it leaves the reason for the day's constant repetition ambiguous. It leaves it up to the viewer to decide why that happened to him. It makes the viewer wonder if there was an entity or something else that was doing this to him in hopes of having him change his life and personality around. I can understand why someone wouldn't like this, but I didn't mind it because it gave the film sort of an alien or other-worldly feel to it. That's not to say that the movie didn't have one to begin with, but the ambiguity increased it.Phil's character development in the movie is very convincing and realistic because we can easily believe that the situation would make him react the way he does. There are dark periods in the film when he endangers his life, does illegal activities, and tries to commit suicide. There are also reckless periods in the film when he tries weird and foolish things he wouldn't normally try. Finally, there are some happy periods in the film when he tries to improve on his life and personality. It makes sense that he would try different things because since he doesn't know anything about the situation: There is no way for him to know how to stop it from happening and whether or not he's supposed to do something. Since he loves Rita, the only way he can impress her is by actually changing instead of faking it. At one point in the movie, Rita says that egocentricity is one of his ""defining characteristics"". He doesn't stop being egocentric at the end. He just learns to use it in a positive direction.One of the other great things about this film is Bill Murray's terrific acting. I can't think of any actor who would've performed the role better than Bill Murray did. He proved to us that he's not only able to show dramatic depth, but he is also able to combine a comedic and serious side all into the same character. I think that his role here is his best performance yet.The only thing I didn't like about it is that I wished it was funnier. Of course, there were only a couple points in the film when it made me laugh. However, even the jokes that I did laugh at weren't super creative or that well-written. However, this is my only complaint for the film and nothing else really bugged me about it.In conclusion, this could've just been a good movie, but the fantastic choice of turning it into a character study makes it something special. His character development was interesting and convincing and it was handled very well in the movie. The feeling of ambiguity and Bill Murray's incredible acting also helped to carry this movie. Even though it was light on comedy, this is still an amazing comedy film which ranks up there with some of the very best of the genre.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
An iconic masterpiece,"I'm pretty sure everyone in America has seen Groundhog Day, and that most of America watches it every year on the holiday itself. I'm included in the latter and have seen the movie over twenty times with my family. We eat Angel food cake, stuffing it in our mouths when Bill Murray does onscreen, and we drink sweet vermouth on the rocks with a twist. Even as kids, we drank bitters to pretend we could fit in with Andie MacDowell. We even have a relative who tried to calculate just how many Groundhog Days Bill lived through! Our family is hardly unique, and I'm sure millions of others enjoy the same ritual every February 2nd.Bill Murray will forever be immortalized in American cinema for his role as an unlikable, sarcastic, jaded weatherman assigned to the small town of Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania with his socially awkward cameraman, Chris Elliot, and his new, optimistic producer, Andie MacDowell, to cover the Groundhog Day festivities. I love this movie, but I would love it even more had Michael Keaton accepted the role, because in scenes where the character is supposed to show growth and new kindness, Bill's not particularly convincing. He is extremely convincing during most of the movie, when he's irritable, rude, and condescending. And, since this movie is a fantasy about living the same day over and over again with no consequences, it's cathartic for the audience to watch Bill's socially inacceptable behavior. How many times have we longed to tell off an irritating salesman? Bill gets to punch Stephen Tobolowsky in the face for us!There's so much to love about this movie, full of contrasts and imagination. Sweet Andie MacDowell is contrasted by Marita Geraghty's silliness. Everyone in the town takes themselves so seriously, providing the perfect surreal surrounding for Bill Murray's distaste. On the drive over, he insults the entire town, calling the residents ""hicks"" and ""morons"", setting the stage for a truly moving transformation. In Harold Ramis's iconic, inventive classic, audiences get to reappreciate small town charm, shrug off years of indifference and assumptions, learn to believe in love, and have faith in the belief that anyone can change. No matter how awful someone is, given several hundred second chances, he can change. And, in the ultimate lesson of optimism, even a simple bad day can turn into a lifechanging good one.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"

The Defining Film of Bill Murray's Career!,"As a movie buff, I cannot believe that I have not seen Groundhog Day until now and I wonder what put me off from seeing this movie for so long, especially as a big Bill Murray fan. This film uses his comedic talent to a long extent, but also this is a showcase for his dramatic talent too. This film has a rather interesting concept in reliving a day every day for what seems to be forever. This film is somewhat predictable, but it has a sweet, undeniable message about love and life.Harold Ramis, who also co-wrote this film, directs a film about a grumpy TV anchor named Phil Connors who has to go to Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania to cover the events along with his lovely producer and his wise-cracking camera-man. But after a big blizzard strikes the area, Phil is stuck in a time loop and he must relive the day over and over and over again.This is one of the best films of Bill Murray's career. He was excellent in such films like Ghostbusters and Lost in Translation, but his role here is even better. Even though he is like Scrooge in the film, he still managed to be hilarious. He gave his character an edge where we can like him despite his rudeness. Andie Macdowell also does a really good job as Rita, Phil's producer.Overall, Groundhog Day is a magical film that has an original sci-fi concept, but manages to effectively work comedy and romance to that concept. While it seems complicated, it's actually a simple story. We just have to thank the screenplay that Harold Ramis co-wrote for that. I don't normally give perfect scores to comedies so that proves how great this film really is. A magical, funny adventure about love. I rate this film 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"

One the best movies of all times - on a comical level,"I must admit this movie was one of my favorites when I was a teenager. I'm just watching it again, and I felt it necessary to review this film, as the effect has not only not faded away, but actually made the jokes more powerful - as I grasp on them differently, more fully.Bill Murry's jerk character is so hilarious and original, and his lines are so funny that you cannot resist liking him. On the other hand Andy's angelic, curly haired, innocent face opposes this brut.I think one of the smartest ideas is that the setting is pure and simple: it could be anywhere BUT nowhere important. Of course, it is important for our character to get stuck in the middle of nowhere - as of course it wouldn't come as a curse to spend every day on a nice island or a big city. Here monotomy hits us hard. And here comes the maturity: people in their 30s, 40s can easily get the metaphor: that 'every day looks the same'. We work, sleep, eat, .... and what else? Something is missing, right? It takes an eternity to realize that there are more important things, human relations, remembering who we are, what makes us happy - and the full capacity of love. This deeper message is nicely wrapped in a funny storytelling, and even more hilarious actions. I don't think we have to simplify it for a ""bad"" man becoming ""good"", more virtous, but rather waking up from his own 'groundhog' sleep, a sleep in which he has been spending most of his life....Have fun, and don't be afraid of your own shadow:)",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
An endless day where everyday is like Sunday,"Phil Connors, a cynical and unbearable journalist goes like every year in a small town in Pennsylvania to report on ""Groundhog Day"", it means the beginning of the spring. But, he is out of luck because due to the bad weather, he and his crew (including the pretty Rita) he is compelled to stay at his work place for the night. The following day, he awakes and lives exactly the same day again but he is the only one to realize it. It is like this, the next days again and again! What should Phil do to stop this? Maybe an improvement of his personality would be the wisest solution.You can easily imagine what a filmmaker like Frank Capra would have done with such a topic but Harold Ramis managed very well and he signs here his most beautiful success to date and one of the finest comedies of the nineties. The main strength of ""Groundhog Day"" comes from a strong and inventive screenplay which enables Bill Murray to go through all the different states which is logical because if tomorrow is the same day, anything goes for him! The script also draws its comical force from the repetition. This process gives delightful sequences, notably in the first part of the movie. You have to see Murray live the same day again, faced with the same situations and as he despises people, it can only make the spectator laugh. Moreover, Ramis described his main character by mocking at him a little.Of course, the evolution followed by Murray is a little predictable (scornful at the beginning, he will succeed in becoming nice at the end of the film and in finding love with Rita) and you easily guess the message that Ramis tries to put across. But it remains nevertheless warm and deeply humane. However that may be, the director gave us a pleasant, sometimes funny sometimes moving movie to watch.

They didn't even try to make it seem as if he was interested in Rita and then all of a sudden she is the only woman he wants and is in love with.2.

Mind you, from her perspective, she only knows Phil for a day, so it really doesn't make any sense, doesn't matter how nice he acts, for her to suddenly fall in love with him. Well, for such a bad written character it does make sense. Phil is not even a good person, and neither does he become one.4. The jokes are bad because they are basically creepy in any other context.5. But what the fog how uncomfortable was this movie. Why is his 'curse' lifted when Rita sleeps with him, or sleeps by his side? What does that mean? Is it true love?

Never Loses It's Luster,"I've seen this movie so many times that I can't count. The more you watch it, the more you realize how much of an exercise in human emotion and self evaluation that it is. This is such a beautiful film that will stand the test of time, and the performances are outstanding. It's just a beautiful, comforting film. They don't make them like this anymore. When it first came out, I remember that it was criticized for the repetitiveness. When you really dig in, you realize that it has to be that way so that the character can finally get it right.It's such an understated film about our purpose & existence and what we can do to control it. This is also a tailor made film for Bill, he absolutely kills it. This will be shown on AMC in the not to very future on repeat, as it should.

The most underrated movie ever made?,"When people assemble their lists of great film comedies, this never appears on the list. It should.It has absolutely everything a great comedy should have.First, it's funny. Bill Murray is the master of comic insincerity and he plays it to the hilt in this movie. He is a weatherman who is to Ground Hog Day as Ebenezer Scrooge is to Christmas. Fate gets fed up with his attitude and forces him to relive that day until he gets it right.Second, it's deep. He doesn't get it right the first time, or perhaps for years. He does what any human would do in the situation. Early on, he uses his knowledge of that day to play God. Then, he uses it to have fun and get women. Then, he is filled with despair and tries to end it with his own death. Then, after trying every crass and immature thing he can think of, he finally realizes that he can actually enjoy his fate if he is reliving a great day, so he makes it so. He makes himself a better person, but the transformation happens only after many missteps ... exactly what would happen to anybody really caught in the situation.How many comedies do you know in which the lead character quotes Chekhov and recites French poetry? Both to good effect (One sincere and touching, the other insincere beyond my ability to describe.)Murray is terrific, as is Andie MacDowell. The supporting players are all spot-on.It's just a terrific comedy. It should have won a whole bunch of awards. Why it did not is a mystery.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
Groundhog Is Jesus,"Groundhog Day was a Harold Ramis-Danny Green script that Ramis ingeniously shot in a freezing Woodstock, IL for a 1993 release. All the film critics at the time noted it as a cute romantic comedy with no particular accomplishment. Everyone I know who has seen it, myself included, liked it and smiled on their way out of the theater. Groundhog Day is on the American calendar, and the film is often played on that day in mid-winter where those of us in colder climates are dreaming of Spring. Today Groundhog Day is considered one of the great American Films of the late 20th Century. Danny Rubin created the concept while Harold Ramis, co-writer of Animal House and Caddyshack broke away from his previous gross-comedy productions to direct his Opus Maximus. That's how Jonah Goldberg of the National Review described it in the February 2005 issue of the Conservative magazine.I read the 2003 New Yorker piece about Ramis. He's Chicago born Jew with no religious training. He is a Hollywood director, actor, and comedy scriptwriter presently studying Buddhism with his second wife. I don't know anything about Danny Rubin other than his version of the script had Andi MacDowell also reliving Groundhog Day along with Murray's Phil, the slimy weatherman for a Pittsburgh TV station. Ramis made the necessary changes and the rest is possibly the greatest non-secular religious experience in American Cinema. The fact that Rabbi's, Ministers, and Priests are showing this film to their parishioners all over the world is a testament to the film's masterful Aristotelian philosophy of redemption and rebirth.There are so many classic comedy bits, lines to remember, and moments of hilarity for a short review but often overlooked is the theme of rescue through learning. Adults are cursed to make the same mistakes over and over again. Every Freudian shrink has heard his patient's repetition of behavior. Every man is trapped by his wiring. Then, sometimes, maybe because of a catastrophic event, a religious insight, or an intelligent evaluation, there is an epiphany. We can't be sure how the application of intelligence, talent, or luck can establish great work, but we must appreciate it when we see it and be the Groundhog.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
Very enjoyable comedy that is totally driven by a great Bill Murray,"Weather man Phil goes to a small village in Western Pennsylvania to cover the start of spring on Groundhog Day.  Despite his cynical approach to the whole thing he gets through the day but gets trapped in the town by a blizzard.  However he finds that he is doomed to repeat the same day over and over again bringing him out in a series of reactions until he can work out what he is meant to learn.The premises sounds silly  who would want to watch the same day over and over again? Even if it is a comedy?  However with Harold Ramis in control this easily becomes something better than it sounds.  The plot may be a sentimental thing at the end of the day but since the plot is simple it leaves a lot of space for things to repeat.  The message when it comes is good  about becoming a better person and learning to care for others being the most important stage.The key to the film however is the space where things just repeat.  This leaves Bill Murray plenty of time to let his sarcastic wit run riot  whether it be cruel as at the start or more gentle towards the end.  His impact on the film is immeasurable.  Unless you hate him then he makes the whole film work.The rest of the cast is made up of plenty of well-known faces from similar comedy films.  Andie MacDowell may not have been the best choice for a love interest but she's actually not too bad compared to how vapid she can be. The rest of the cast has the likes of Chris Elliott, Stephen Tobolowsky, Doyle-Murphy etc  a whole pile of `where have I seen him before' types.Overall this is a very enjoyable comedy from a good director and great star. The film is a good idea but it is totally brought to life by a wonderful performance by Murray.  The film may well be a slight comedy at heart but it is very enjoyable.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
"Hardly profound, but likable enough...","""Groundhog Day"" is a satisfying comedy marked by some whimsy and an unexpected and sweet romance. Bill Murray doesn't stretch much playing a nasty, uncouth TV weatherman, unhappily covering Groundhog Day in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, who is forced by fate into reliving the same 24hr day over and over until he becomes a better person. As written by Harold Ramis (who also directed) and Danny Rubin from Rubin's original treatment, the film is surprisingly inventive considering it has to face a fatigued sort of repetition. The colorful, uniformly excellent supporting cast is a big help to Murray, who doesn't go through as many changes as one might hope (he stays pretty much the same until the picture's third act). Ramis keeps a breezy, effortless pace--and he knows how to touch our hearts without getting maudlin (no small feat). Fresh-faced Andie MacDowell once again provides us with a delightful love-interest, playing the woman Murray intends to win if only he can modify his bad manners. Cantankerous leading characters can sometimes be a drag on the screen, even if their slow-building rehabilitation is done with a gentle touch; here, Ramis and Rubin team with their star to create an irritable, grouchy human being and manage to make him both funny and endearing. *** from ****",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"

Groundhog Day 1993 Review,"It's Groundhog Day, so of course I had to watch this.I definitely don't think I liked it as much as most, but it's still a solid rom-com that really grounded and inspired future time loop themed films.

"Complex, endearing movie; more than just ""high concept"" comedy.","Only with the passage of time and an increased sense of awareness can I now see a remarkable movie like ""Groundhog Day"" for what it is. The last time I watched it, and that was some time ago, I mostly saw an engaging comedy / drama / fantasy with moments both funny and sobering. Now, I can look at it and see what a thoughtful piece of work it is. It is true that it's the kind of movie that really does benefit from repeat viewings.Bill Murray makes the most of a weighty role as Phil Connors, egocentric, wise ass weatherman who travels to the Pennsylvania community of Punsxutawney to cover its annual Groundhog Day ceremony. A blizzard confines him to the town - a blizzard he failed to predict accurately - and while there he realizes he's trapped in a time loop; Groundhog Day repeats itself over and over, to the point where Phil becomes aware of practically every event that will occur. By turns, Phil is both ecstatic - if there's no tomorrow, he doesn't have to worry about the consequences of his actions, and he engages in some great comic bits of recklessness - and despondent, when his attempts to use his knowledge for self gain go awry. Only after some efforts to come to grips with the course of events does he realize the power of any human being's thoughts and actions, as he has the ability to be there for other people and even save their lives.Murray is great, whether he's being introspective, rascally / charming, or saddened. Andie MacDowell provides an appealing love interest as Rita, the terminally chipper producer to whom he realizes he's becoming attracted. A supporting cast of familiar faces also helps: Chris Elliott as the cameraman, Stephen Tobolowsky (in his best known role) as aggressive insurance salesman Ned Ryerson, Bill's older brother Brian Doyle- Murray as ""groundhog honcho"" Buster Green, comedians Rick Ducommun and Rick Overton as scruffy locals, Robin Duke as the diner waitress, and, in his film debut, a young Michael Shannon as a guy getting married.Director / co-writer Harold Ramis, making a cameo as a local neurologist, keeps things headed in clever directions (it's a delicious bit of dark comedy when Phil tries various means of suicide in his attempts to end the cycle), always successfully alternating between the laughs and the more touching elements. In fact, ""Groundhog Day"" is simply very sweet as Phil develops more of an interest in an old homeless man's welfare and becomes increasingly attached to Rita. And George Fenton's music always hits just the right notes for any given scene. In short, it's one of the star's best ever vehicles and a consistently entertaining movie worth revisiting.10 out of 10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
Going 'round and 'round the mountain with Bill Murray and Andie MacDowell,"A curmudgeonly weather reporter from Pittsburgh (Bill Murray) has to report on the Groundhog Day festivities at Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, for the fifth year in a row. He soon finds himself in some kind of strange time warp. Andie MacDowell plays a new producer for the network who joins him on the trek, along with Chris Elliott as the cameraman.""Groundhog Day"" (1993) is a dramedy/fantasy with some romance about a person who has lost the joy of living and become a cranky, arrogant jerk. Is he too far gone to change? The movie's equal parts amusing and profound. The theme revolves around getting stuck in a rut in life and desperately trying to find the way OUT. Meanwhile the woodchuck is cute.Beyond MacDowell on the female front, Marita Geraghty plays a potential date for Murray's character; you might remember her from the Seinfeld episode ""The Big Salad"" as Margaret.

He learns that by developing his artistic side he will learn to love and be loved. He learns to sculpt and play the piano beautifully.

Perhaps that style of humour was all the rage in 1993 but it didn't do the job for me.The best thing about this film is the underlying concept. It's great and has spawned a whole new genre of time-loop films (all of the ones I can think of are far superior to Groundhog Day in truth). They did manage to extract some decent comedic and dramatic potential out of the scenario, and I did enjoy the final 20 minutes or so.On the whole this film is fine, but is perhaps in with a shout as one of the most overrated films going.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
Philosophy held in such a terrific movies,"Groundhog Day is a light comedy. But it is not just a simple comedy.

Well, but what if we truly face the similar predicament?Assuming that we all have to suffer the same day like Phil and whatever we did today would leave no impact on others tomorrow and what makes you awake everyday is a song saying I got you Babe , maybe most of us would react to this crazy predicament passively and madly like what Phil did at first, giving everything up as despair. But when we reflect the situation more calmly,we might live a totally different lives. Just as the Phil did in the movie,he took up piano, began reading, learned to ice-sculpt.Everything seems better than beforeThere are many truth conveyed in this movie, and I do appreciate such a ingenious movie.

A spiritual and philosophical film that also happens to be quite entertaining.,"""What would you do if you were stuck in one place and every day was exactly the same, and nothing that you did mattered?"" ""That about sums it up for me.""There are films that don't necessarily need inventive and artistic camera shots, or groundbreaking special effects, or even gorgeous cinematography to be considered masterpieces. Sometimes a film like Groundhog Day comes along with a smart and charming story with performances and characters that are so well developed that it automatically connects with audiences by reaching for the heart, and turning it into an instant classic. With a premise that might seem boring due to the fact that the lead character has to repeat and live the same day over and over again in a small Pennsylvania town, director Harold Ramis manages to catch our attention by creating interesting characters and through a witty script he introduces important themes such as existentialism in a rather refreshing and light way. It is a very spiritual film without ever feeling religious. In a way the story reminded me of Dickens' A Christmas Story where you have an egocentric and arrogant character who is transformed once he experiences a supernatural event. In Groundhog Day the transformation is much more subtle while at times it does go to dark places. Ironically Bill Murray went on to play Scrooge in one of the many adaptations of Dickens' classic tale. Murray is the heart and soul of this film and although he is hard to like at the beginning of the film there is something about his performance that keeps us interested in him. This isn't one of those laugh out loud comedies (I don't think I laughed at a single scene), but it is so charming that it is impossible to resist and it leaves you with a smile on your face during its entire running time. Once it ends we realize how philosophical this film really was, but Ramis kept us so entertained that we didn't really pick up on it until the very end.The original screenplay for Groundhog Day was co-written by Harold Ramis and Danny Rubin. It centers on a weatherman named Phil Connors (Bill Murray) working as a TV meteorologist for a local Pittsburgh station. Phil is an arrogant narcissist who is expecting to work for a more important broadcasting channel soon. On the eve of Groundhog Day, he is sent to the small town of Punxsutawney to cover the annual festivities along with his producer, Rita (Andie MacDowell), and cameraman Larry (Chris Elliott) with whom he doesn't get along very well. Phil hates this assignment which he has covered over the past four years so he doesn't put much effort into his report. After covering the event an unexpected blizzard forces the roads to close so Phil and his crew are stuck in Punxsutawney for another day. The next day Phil wakes up and realizes he has to relive Groundhog Day all over again and he's the only one that notices that the day unfolds in the exact same way. Everyone else seems to be living the day for the first time, but he finds himself stuck in the same day over and over again like if he were trapped in a loop hole with no way out.The premise seemed boring for me at first considering I thought it was going to repeat itself too many times, but Murray's character is so fun and he relives each day in so many different ways that it managed to keep me entertained. At first Phil feels like he has gone mad and tries to rationalize things, but once he realizes his fate he decides to take advantage of it. Being the self centered person he is, Phil lives knowing he wont have to suffer any consequences, but eventually he grows tired of this hedonistic lifestyle. He feels so desperate that he tries to commit suicide in every possible way, but no matter what he does he still wakes up the next morning reliving Groundhog Day. Eventually Phil gives up on living for himself and begins looking at others and caring for them. He begins to find purpose and joy in life in helping others. Ramis has made a deeply spiritual and philosophical film without the audience realizing it at first. It could have become tedious and preachy, but it never does because the characters are subtly transformed and the growing chemistry between Phil and Rita is believable. Ramis found a way to reach out to our hearts and remind us that life isn't about living for ourselves, but finding pleasure in helping and caring for others. Groundhog Day is a movie about self- improvement and becoming a better person and I can't think of a better actor to have pulled it off so well as Bill Murray did in his transformation here.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
Great film from Harold Ramis,"Why Connors is forced to relive the same day isn't explained, but it is made clear that Connors was trapped in a cycle of repetition even before his never-ending day began. Projecting nothing but facile sarcasm, ironic self-awareness and aloof detachment, Connors is a thoroughly postmodern man, his life long filled with what he perceives to be pointless and mindless routine. But Connors is not a pessimist or self-centred, so much as he is super-aware, perpetually dejected and world-weary. For Connors, every day offers only what philosopher Francois Cusset called the ""dead end of postmodernity"". Enchantment is thoroughly dead and everything that will happen has already happened.When Connors wakes up to find that today is, and always will be, yesterday, he is forced into violently confronting the fact that postmodernism conceives of contemporary life as a spectacle before which the individual always sits powerless, and within which questions of the real are always problematized. To the postmodern subject, there is nowhere else, no other time or place, the subject a ghost-viewer in a movie that plays regardless of his volition.At first Connors uses this opportunity to engage in pranks, hedonism and deceit, concocting schemes to amass money and bed a beautiful woman, played by Andie McDowell, but gradually these games start to lose their appeal. After learning that all the material and sexual gratifications in the world are not spiritually sustaining, Connors grows suicidal. He takes his life several times, but still the curse continues.From here on the plot becomes a mixture of the myth of Sisyphus and Dickens' ""A Christmas Carol"" (Bill Murray is essentially Ebenezer Scrooge), with a little Camus and Nietczhe thrown in. The film's existential avenues are best hinted at by a poem (The Lay of the Last Minstrel) by Sir Walter Scott, an excerpt of which Andie McDowell recites to Connors in a diner: ""Despite those titles, power, and pelf, The wretch, concentrated all in self, Living shall forfeit fair renown, And doubly dying, shall go down, To the vile dust from whence he sprung, Unwept, unhonoured, and unsung.""",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"

Superb Bill Murray in ingeniously conceived comedy,"This is an ingenious comedy that turns out to have a heart. Bill Murray is simply superb as the narcissistic weather man who finds himself trapped in a bizarre twilight zone episode. Reliving each day over and over again leads to some brilliant comic set-pieces. However, its the gradual change in Murray's character and his cheerful acceptance of things which makes this film a perennial favorite of mine. There are plenty of laughs but mostly in the first hour, after which the tone changes slightly. The supporting cast are all fine and Andie Macdowell is good as the leading lady. An excellent comedy that makes you think.Overall 9/10",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
And the day repeats itself over and over again!,"As I'm writing this review, the day is groundhog day! As you may know, this is the time of the year when the groundhog comes out of a tree and tells whether it will cold or warm for the next 6 weeks. This movie is about two things: the holiday itself and the feeling of Deja vu (when you feel like you already experienced something before)
The main character is Phil Connors (Bill Murray) who is a skeptic weatherman that had to do a news report in a small town about groundhog day. After a dreadful day for Phil ends, he wakes up and it's Groundhog day, again! He meets the homeless man and his ex classmate Ned Ryason again, hears the exact same song on radio and answers to the same questions that he already talked about yesterday. And it goes again and again. However, Phil comes up with lot's of ideas to make each day feel distinct, both in a good and a bad way. One time he stole a car and got hit by train, one time he tried to date pretty women, later he would eat lots of sugar, and then later, he would try to escape from this cursed town in many ways. There's also Rita (Andie Macdowell) who is the reason why Phil became nicer throughout the movie. Thanks to her, he learned how to play the piano and began to read French literature. Not only that, he also spent dates with Rita, playing in the snow and building snowmen. I honestly liked the chemistry between the two, which remind me of Beauty and the beast or Megamind and Roxanne Richi or even Hal and Rosemary from shallow Hal, because of the whole ""if you meet the right person, you will become a better one yourself"", which is actually a true statement in my opinion. Since it's also a comedy, it definitely has it's fair share of funny scenes: for example when Phil and the groundhog were riding a car away from the police. Or when Phil tried to convince Rita that he's a god, but not the God, because no matter what he tries, even his attempts at dying, he always comes back to February second. I won't say it's laugh out loud, since it's a more chill kind of a movie unlike What happens in Vegas or Beethoven where it's mostly humour (but has heart too), but it does give some positive moments to make sure that at least smiled. The moral is great too, to always be nice to people and try to do something new every day to make each one special.The acting from Murray and MacDowell is great in my opinion. Both act so well that you would believe that they just live like they are a part of the story, which is awesome! Definitely a classic movie in my eyes. The only issues were that the beginning was a little bit slow and boring in my opinion, but at least it gives the exposition of this town and how the plot will go on. Another bad thing is that there's actually a worse version of this movie in my opinion called ""Edge of tomorrow"", which is basically the same movie but in an alien war setting and with Tom Cruise and Emily Blunt. So my recommendation is to only watch the true original groundhog day movie, which is this one, however, if your curious enough to watch and compare both films, then I guess I won't stop you from doing it. After all, there's a chance that you may enjoy the other movie. But as for this one, I recommend it just to know what the term means and how is it so popular in our culture.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"

Murray plays Phil Connors, an arrogant, sarcastic weatherman who begrudgingly travels to the town of Punxsutawney in Pennsylvania to cover the annual Groundhog Day, where the locals gather to watch the unveiling of a hog and to find out if it'll be a long winter or an early spring. Phil is joined by his producer Rita and cameraman Larry. Just before they leave town, a blizzard cuts off the roads and they have to stay in the town another night. The next morning, Phil wakes up to the exact same day again, and when he realises that he is stuck in a loop, possibly condemned to live the same day forever, he starts to make it work for him, by doing crazy things and trying to make Rita fall in love with him.

By spending this one particular day anew he gets to know every single person in this small town, and is able to profit from all the information acquired. He also tries to get closer to Rita but fails miserably. That's phase one.In phase two, Phil realizes (after falling off a cliff in a car) that he became immortal somehow and won't die. So he tries to commit suicide in every possible way and still wakes up at 6 a.m. in the same bed listening to a song by Sonny & Cher. He starts to feel miserable and tired of all the mess that he's in.And then comes phase three. He once again wants to seduce Rita. He gets to know her better day after day, in order to finally be able to sleep with her. However, as convincing as he may be, she still rejects him after all. The ultimate way to make her fall in love with him is through good deeds. After all that time he understands that by being altruistic and helpful towards other people goes a road to a woman's heart.The main quality of the movie is contained in its ability to show mostly the same sequences all over again (well, that's what it's all about), but do it in such a manner that isn't boring or dull. Even though it's the same day, the events, actions, and people that the viewer sees are different or presented in an alternative manner.This is probably one of Bill Murray's funniest roles. I always admired his passion for acting, and in Groundhog Day he is convincing enough to say that he might as well play in joyful comedies, as in respectable dramas. His performance makes the movie much more pleasurable, as we are able to look at the transformation of his character and the gradual changes that he goes through from point A (destroy, burn, steal) to point B (love, care, understand).All in all, I won't say that Groundhog Day is my favorite comedy, but it definitely showed me that even some light-hearted comedies are able to pass a meaningful message to the world, and at the same time, make you laugh at the ridiculousness of their storyline.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
Boring,"If you like seeing the same thing over and over again, you will LOVE this movie. For me it was about as tedious and boring of a movie as you can get. I like Bill Murray but I could not stand this movie as the synopsis states it repeated Groundhog Day over and over again. I am not sure what the people that gave this 10 stars or near 10 stars were watching but next to Ishtar this move really sucked. The same thing happens, the same thing happens, the same thing happens, the same thing happens, get the point? Till basically the end. I was ready to shoot myself but then it did finally end. I just remember thinking it would be the last time they would repeat Groundhog day but it kept going till I finally made it through the movie. If I would have known how many times they were going to repeat it I would have turned it off after the second time. Well, I think you get the point I am starting to sound like the movie.",1.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
How We Spend Everyday,"I only saw this movie once with my parents on Groundhogs Day, 2013. I didn't even know what the movie was about, not even knowing that the plot would be about a day repeating itself over and over. So, yeah while only seeing this movie one time, the plot is memorable along with the messages from the movie. To me personally, I can't think of any movie that has ever left me with a more positive message than this movie. Most movies will try to leave you with a good life message, but this movie has a very powerful message. Let's think about this movie in perspective trying not to use any spoilers. Well, Groundhog's Day is a holiday and one of the smaller holidays, a holiday most of us probably don't think much about except on February 2nd. It's not like Halloween which is coming up where we're already seeing decorations and costumes out, or Christmas where in 2 months we will see a lot of Christmas decorations along with hearing Christmas music on many radio stations. Groundhog's Day is mostly like a regular day where school doesn't get canceled or anything, and we find out on the news depending on if the Groundhog sees his shadow if we will have an early Spring or 6 more weeks of winter. In this movie, a weatherman known as Phil played by Bill Murray goes with his team to a certain town in Pennsylvania to do a report on the annual Groundhog's Day ceremony. After Phil stays with his team there another night because of a snowstorm, he notices he wakes up not to the next day, but the previous day Groundhog's Day, and the same thing seems to happen over and over and no matter how Phil spends his day, it just seems to continually repeat itself. Nobody else is aware of this time loop and it seems like everything goes the same way with the rest of the community during the day, only Phil can change the events happening by anticipating what is going to happen. So, basically the message this movie has taught me, is how we have everyday a period of 24 hours and we are the ones who decide how to spend the time each day. Most of the things we do each day are probably based on routine and habit, which is a good reason to get into good habits making somethings more natural to us. Obviously, we have countless opportunities of what we can do every single day with our time. Interestingly, we often times look back and are amazed at all the time that has passed from memorable moments, thinking the time flies. However, this movie shows how we spend are time in a single day and what we can do with all those opportunities, doing different things if a day keeps repeating itself, and getting different things from what we choose to do, like Phil chose to learn how to play the piano and get to know the community. So, basically each day is an opportunity in our life to do something, even things we've never done before. I personally am amazed at all we can do in a single day. I thought about that when I ran Cross Country in College, some days we would run 10 miles on scenic routes in the middle of nowhere on a day where we had classes, and a school night. We'd get back in time for dinner and to do homework. It was interesting to see myself in places I'm normally at on vacations in just an afternoon during a Cross Country practice along with getting good exercise and seeing the beautiful world. So, we might not be able to see the end from the beginning like Murray could. But, often times we don't take chances in life and miss out on opportunities we have because we are too afraid and don't try and unlike Phil some of those opportunities we have now, never come back. It's up to us to do what we can as I read earlier today on the internet, ""If You Think Adventure Is Dangerous, Try Routine It's Lethal."" The plot of a time loop has also been a plot in other movies like one more recently with Zachary Gordon, ""Pete's Christmas,"" which wasn't nearly as good as this is. But, we just need to think about how we spend are time and what we do, and we will get results. Some of those results will last a lifetime. I'd give this movie a 10/10. While it's not one of my favorite movies, not like one I'd care to own. I give it a 10/10 because of the positive message it leaves us with.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"

Before Jim Carrey There Was Bill Murray.,"Though I'm not a big fan of Bill Murray, this film was highly entertaining and refreshing. Having missed a chance to see it in my youth, I am seeing this film for the first time in my thirties. These days I research about a film first before I see it. The concept of this film appealed to my imagination: a man repeating a specific day, Groundhog day, over and over again.With time, this man Phil Connors(Bill Murray) learns to turn every situation and encounter to his advantage. Some may think that this guy is evil since he can toy around with anyone without getting implicated.Bill Murray was the ideal character for this film since he is egocentric and sarcastic. His has the ability to make you laugh while remaining straight-faced. Only a few actors have this precious ability.The other noble person in the film is actress Andie MacDowell. She plays news producer Rita Hanson (MacDowell), who is the love interest of Phil.Will Phil ever escape this time-loop?

"Magnum opus of cinema, and life.","Why is this movie so universal? Why is to so funny and charming, so human and so addictive? I reckon it's because it answers so many important questions that each and every one of us seek answer to fruitlessly every day of our lives. Story is original and funny, a bitter and somewhat misanthropic weatherman comes on business to a small town which he despises from the very bottom of his soul, only to have his life completely flipped around when he starts reliving the same day again, and again, and again...Wrapped up in a cocoon of simple story in a small rural town, Groundhog day turns out to be a self-help vessel carrying to us a reminder of what is really important in life. Although it never openly preaches it's message, somehow along this journey I found myself being gradually filled up with feelings I want to be filled up with everyday of my life. Turning on the movie and starting out with mundane grey feelings of everyday life full of useless obligatory commitments, suddenly I wanted to love, to be nice to people and to be accepted, to learn as much as possible and to help, to share, to give, and to be given in return nothing else but happiness.Not many movies have you feel proud to be a human being by the end, and even less of them leave you with a desire to self improve and be a better person, Groundhog day is luckily one of them, and you definitely owe yourself to watch it. And when these feelings leave your side, force yourself to watch it again, and again, and again",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
A Premise That Has Been Done Better In Recent Years,"Perhaps this film gets billed too heavily as ""one of the greatest comedies & rom-coms ever"" because I neither found it to be all that funny nor charming on the romantic level either.

As unfortunate as it may be, the concept of the time-loop story has been done so many times now in movies and TV shows (almost all of them better) that this film feels far inferior and dated.

Murray is hilarious as the self-centered jerk who has more than one chance to see the error of his ways and plays it to the hilt.

It was fine,"It's fine, I don't get how it's so popular though. Perhaps it was unique and novel in it's day but watching it as a 20 year old in 2023 it feels quite done to death, and like a very generic 90s movie. I found the ending somewhat unsatisfying and the movie essentially does not develop any character other than Bill Murray's. To be fair that is quite hard since they have to undo that character right at the next day, but they could at least give more depth, Murray's character is implied to know all about everything and everyone in the town by the end, it would have been nice to feel that way ourselves, but I didn't feel like I did.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
Great Movie About Unconditional Love,"The human condition is to love everything unconditionally. I belive 'Groundhog Day' explores that happiness depends on our capacity to love. There's a spectrum of beauty, and it is effortless to see the beauty at a museum or watch a sunset, but can you see the beauty of everyday life of the most mundane ugly things. To live the greatest life possible is just none other than to see beauty everywhere. Love is a universal property, it's fundamental. It's not a sexual attraction or a romance, therefore, Unconditional love is the absolute acceptance of everything even the bad things. The reason that the universe could say has love is because the universe accepts itself completely without judgement. It's not resisting any part of itself, it loves every piece of itself. It's a love so deep that you can't even imagine what evil is because you love everything so much that there's no more room left for evil to exist.

At first, he makes a game of it, then he tries killing himself, and finally comes around to realizing he's been given a second chance. You've seen the plot before, but never so well done.

Great Performance by Murray,"Groundhog Day (1993)** 1/2 (out of 4)Bill Murray turns in a wonderful performance as an obnoxious jerk weatherman who finds himself covering some Groundhog Day events but at the end of the day he finds himself waking up having to repeat the day over and over again. GROUNDHOG DAY appears to have become one of the biggest classics of the decade but I remember watching it in 1993 and not caring too much for it. This here was my first time revisiting the title and I'll admit that I liked it a tad bit more but at the same time I still don't see what everyone else sees in it. There's no question that there are some funny moments and there's no question that Murray does a fantastic job but at the same time the film just doesn't work for me. I think the biggest reason it just doesn't work is because I don't find it all that funny. This is especially true for various scenes that are constantly getting replayed over and over, although they're obviously done in different ways as Murray starts to realize what's going on. It's weird but I really like the concept here of the same thing being repeated but at the same time it's just not all that funny to me. I think what comedy does work is due to Murray's performance. I think what works so well with the performance is that we can believe him as the jerk as well as the transformation into the nice guy. Murray gets to play many different sides to this character and he really nails all of them. As the jerk you can't stand him but he slowly makes you care for the guy and especially towards the end. I think the character development here is actually a lot better than many dramas out there. Andie MacDowell makes for a good love interest and we get nice support from the likes of Chris Elliott and Brian Doyle-Murray. Again, I understand that this film is loved by many. To me it's a flawed film with one great performance and a few nice laughs.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
The real strength of this film lies in the way an ever repeating routine teaches the arrogant Phil a lesson,"Groundhogday is a tradition in the US and Canada. On february 2 the groundhog awakens from his wintersleep. From his behaviour (the tradition believes) it can be predicted if the spring is coming soon or the winter will last for some time.TV weatherman Phil (Bill Murray) has to report about this tradition from the center of Groundhogday, Punxsutawny (Pennsylvania). He can only look at this (in his eyes stupid) tradition and the people who celebrate it with the deepest
contempt. After his report hoewever something strange happens. The next morning it is february 2 again. He is forced to relive this day again and again and again.Time loops are full of logical paradoxes that films are eager to exploit. Think of a film such as ""Back to the future"" (1985, Robert Zemeckis). Also ""Groundhog day"" has its fair share of these paradoxes.The real strength of this film is however in my opinion not to be found in these quirks, but in the way routine (because that's were the ever repeating february 2 stands for of course) teaches Phil a leason. In the film Phil goes through different phases: surprise, opportunism, despair and ultimately acceptance. Only when he finally reaches the accepatance phase, he no longer looks down on the people of Punxsutawny and can escape to february 3.Also in ""Lost in translation"" (2003, Sofia Coppola) Bill Murray plays a chracter that evolves from arrogant to sympathetic.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"

"Man, what a masterpiece!","1993 was a wonderful movie year. 2 movie masterpieces stand out today from it; ""Schindler's list"" and ""Groundhog day"". Personally, I always loved the second one more. ""Groundhog day"" is a perfect example why Bill Murray will always be a superior actor than the Oscar darlings Tom Hanks and Spencer Tracy. He plays Phil whom thanks to a time distortion ( a day repeating itself again and again ) gets away with stealing money, committing suicide 20 times, sleeping with local girls without consequences and finding out everyones deepest secrets.The story is so subtle that you may at first think its just a comedy. But once you think about it, you will realize how almost every problem from life is contained in it. Most noticeable, the one about how people will make the same mistakes again and again, until they change. And that's what's all about: change. Once when Phil changes himself, the world changes finally too. He is a grown man, but childish in his persona. That's why thanks to the time distortion he ages psychologically, until he finally becomes a real man, not a spoiled kid. This is an extreme satire about life. Think about it. Its about the imprisoned human spirit crying for a change, a difference. Phil became an individual, the only person on Earth that has self-consciousness. At that moment all other characters just became puppets. You can also regard it as a parody of Totalitarian regimes ( Phil is the only person that does something different than the others, and that's why he is misunderstood ). Plus the explanation for the mysterious time distortion is never given. It's shown more like something as natural as the weather, something that just happened.--------------The only great film the director Harold Ramis ever made, ""Groundhog day"" was until recently the highest marked Murray film on the site rotten-tomatoes.com with extremely high average grade of 8.1/10. ""Lost in translation"" beat it, with 8.4/10, but quite frankly, it was overrated. If there was any justice, ""Groundhog day"" should have won Oscars and Golden Globes for the best picture, script and the main actor. But alas, since Murray was underrated for so long, its finally time he gets overrated for once!You just have to love him when he is in the studio doing a weather forecast: ""In California there is going to be a big heat tomorrow, and gang fights and too high real estate prizes too. Oh, what's this? A cold front is coming up! Fuuuu( blows the clouds on the screen)."" The only flaw is that some better director could have directed it more radical and extreme than Ramis, but if we love Frank Capra, we must love this symbolic story about the triumph of emotions over cold cynicism.Grade: 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"

"GROUNDHOG DAY (Harold Ramis, 1993) ***","While I had always been aware of this film's considerable reputation, it took me this long to get acquainted with it; in retrospect, I feel the picture to be deserving of the epithet ""modern comedy classic"". It deals with an original – and for the genre, singular – concept: a literal case of multiple deja'-vu experiences (in all fairness, the minor sci-fi entry THE TIME TRAVELERS [1964] had already delved into the theme, though obviously lacking the skill and polish realized here). Bill Murray tackles one of his best roles, actually a variation on the actor's own characterization in the much inferior SCROOGED (1988), which I watched only last week; now he is an arrogant (can he play any other way?) Weather Man assigned to the unexciting titular event in Pennsylvania – eager to get out of there, he not only finds the passage blocked by a snowstorm but, by some unexplained quirk of nature, finds himself reliving the same day over and over again! At first, he is understandably baffled and frustrated by all of this – especially in the face of the obliviousness to his predicament shown by colleagues and townspeople alike; then, he is amused by the sheer predictability of the day's proceedings; gradually, however, he learns to take advantage of this state-of-affairs – not only involving himself in the everyday life of the town, but also striving to better himself (such as becoming an accomplishment piano-player or a hand-craft artisan seemingly in the space of single day); most of all, however, he works at cultivating a loving relationship with Andie McDowell, the producer of his TV program who, normally, cannot stand him! Apparently, Murray and director Ramis (co-stars in STRIPES [1981], another recent viewing, and the GHOSTBUSTERS films) fell out during the making of this one because they had contrasting opinions about the prevailing tone of the script: Murray wanted it to be of a more philosophical bent, while Ramis thought better of extracting the comic potential out of the central situation; in the end, I feel the film strikes a good balance between the two (with plenty of visual gags and assorted mayhem but, at the same time, having a definite bittersweet side to it – in view of the above-mentioned budding romance and also Murray's numerous failed suicides!).",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
Groundhog Day - 12:01 or an Original Work?,"There are some interesting questions involved with the production of Groundhog Day. Was it written by Harold Ramis and George Fenton, or was it written by a crew of TV writers who created the movie film, 12:01? The jury is still out on that conclusion. If you see this film and then see 12:01, you will see much more than a mere coincidence; you will see someone stealing someone else's intellectual property. Both scripts were written in the SAME year, 1993. That is way too much of a coincidence. Somebody copied somebody. I wonder who copied whom?As far as this film is concerned, it is strictly for laughs; 12:01 had some serious dramatic moments as well. This version does not. Did 12:01 add the dramatic elements, or did Groundhog Day copy 12:01 and decided to leave dramatic elements out? One can only speculate.Bill Murray is very funny in this film; it is one of his best.

Unusual that I enjoyed a film involving the supernatural so much,"It's not common that a film involving the surreal or supernatural - especially time travel - is so successful.  I think the reason for this is that once you enter that realm, literally anything goes.  That concept may seem exciting at first, but in practice it can become so illogical and have so little basis in reality that ultimately we can't relate to it.  Consider how silly time travel can become.  For example, in ""Back to the Future"", looking at a photograph and seeing the people in it start to fade?? C'mon. Or dealing with ""paradoxes"" such as going back in time and killing your grandfather.  What now?Not trying to explain how time travel occurs, this movie skirts those issues by simply backing up and reliving a day (there is no chance to ""travel back to the future"" - you must ""live through it"".)  One of the reasons it is so successful is that while ultimately a happy movie, the truly horrible feelings that would inevitably arise in this situation are also explored. Finally living through his day to the next day is a metaphor in this case for the maturing of the main character.  He does not know what is happening to him, but in the end he has been allowed a period of experimentation and growth.  Haven't we all fantasised about that?  For example, having 10 fresh chances to approach a person of the opposite sex we want to meet and seeing which works best?  In the meantime the film explores this journey with both humour and sorrow.  Having 10 fresh chances to try something sounds great if it's your *choice* - but not so great if you never get to stop the carousel and say ""That's a keeper - let's get on with my life now!""  Few actors other than Murray could play this role so well - he seems perfectly cast. Enjoy!",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"

Sublime,"This disarming film seems so simple and innocuous on the surface, and yet it is exceptionally smart, clever and meaningful. Who would have thought that Harold Ramis, crown prince of the slob comedy, and Bill Murray, an actor whose specialty is looking disinterested, would combine to create a work of this caliber? ""Groundhog Day"" eschews cheap laughs and throwaway gags for something much richer, deeper and more sophisticated. The idea of someone living the same day over and over again, until he finally gets it right, is absolutely ingenious.

A Timeless Classic That Captures the Essence of Redemption and Self-Discovery,"""Groundhog Day"" is a timeless classic that transcends genres, blending comedy, romance, and philosophical depth into a captivating and thought-provoking narrative. Directed by Harold Ramis and released in 1993, this film has become a cultural phenomenon, celebrated for its ingenious premise, brilliant performances, and profound exploration of personal growth. With its perfect blend of humor and introspection, ""Groundhog Day"" remains a beloved and enduring gem in the world of cinema.Plot Overview:
The film follows Phil Connors (Bill Murray), a cynical and self-centered weatherman who finds himself trapped in an inexplicable time loop, reliving the same day, Groundhog Day, over and over again. As Phil becomes increasingly frustrated with his predicament, he embarks on a journey of self-discovery and transformation. Through countless repetitions of the day, he begins to reassess his priorities, learn new skills, and find meaning in even the smallest moments. Along the way, he develops an unexpected connection with Rita (Andie MacDowell), his producer, and starts to unravel the mysteries of love, compassion, and true happiness.Review:
""Groundhog Day"" is a masterpiece that seamlessly weaves together comedy, romance, and philosophical themes, creating a profound and entertaining cinematic experience. At its core, the film explores the power of redemption and the potential for personal growth, wrapped in a clever and imaginative time-loop narrative.Bill Murray delivers a career-defining performance as Phil Connors, effortlessly portraying the character's transition from an arrogant and jaded individual to a more compassionate and self-aware person. Murray's impeccable comedic timing and nuanced acting make Phil's journey both hilarious and deeply moving. His interactions with the ensemble cast, including Andie MacDowell as the kind-hearted Rita and Chris Elliott as Phil's quirky cameraman, enhance the film's humor and emotional depth.Harold Ramis's direction is masterful, striking a delicate balance between humor and introspection. He skillfully uses repetition to create comedic moments and explores the existential questions raised by Phil's predicament. The screenplay, written by Ramis and Danny Rubin, cleverly blends comedy with philosophical musings, inviting the audience to reflect on the nature of time, the pursuit of happiness, and the importance of personal growth. The film's pacing is spot-on, allowing the audience to fully immerse themselves in Phil's journey and appreciate the subtle changes that occur as he relives Groundhog Day.The film's setting in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, adds to its charm and whimsy. The quaint small-town atmosphere, combined with the annual Groundhog Day festivities, creates a unique backdrop for Phil's time-loop experience. The cinematography beautifully captures the picturesque winter landscape, further enhancing the film's visual appeal.One of the film's greatest strengths is its ability to resonate with audiences on a deeper level. Beneath the comedy and romance, ""Groundhog Day"" carries profound messages about self-reflection, empathy, and the transformative power of love. It encourages viewers to examine their own lives and consider the impact of their actions on others. The film's enduring popularity can be attributed to its universal themes and the sense of hope it instills, reminding us that personal change and growth are always within reach.In conclusion, ""Groundhog Day"" is a timeless classic that blends comedy.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
Is it snowing in space?,"There's really not a lot you can say about Groundhog Day that hasn't been said before. It's unlikely that anyone remotely interested in Bill Murray would have not seen it by now, and in all likelihood loves it because it's nailed on one of Murray's finest pictures. Of course, as is the case with comedy in general, there are those who don't like it, but in my experience it's the one comedy movie that tickles the funny bones of most the most! Some have seen it just the once and loved it but feel it is a once only movie, others such as myself return to it yearly like an old friend because it's a pick me up, a tonic for the troops, it never fails to deliver the goods.That it has struck such a chord over the years is no surprise, it's a genius premise. Grumpy misanthrope TV weather man Phil Connors (Murray) is once again sent out to Punxsutawney to cover the Groundhog Day festivities. It's a place he considers as dull on earth, the festivities pointless and beneath the broadcasting talent he feels he has. The plan is to get the broadcast done and get out of Punxsutawney as quick as possible. But a snowstorm prevents him leaving and waking up the next day he finds he is stuck in the same Groundhog Day as the day before, and soon he finds that every day is the same day.""I was in the Virgin Islands once. I met a girl. We ate lobster, drank piña coladas. At sunset, we made love like sea otters. That was a pretty good day. Why couldn't I get that day over, and over, and over...""The film then follows a trajectory that sees Connors go through a number of psychological transformations. From despair to using the situation for nefarious means, to despair again and onto using his unique situation to do good. It's material tailor made for Murray who excels with a number of running gags that get expanded upon with each day. However, the ace up Harold Ramis' (director) sleeve is that the film is more than a comedy, it is also an intelligent character study, a message movie and it also doesn't lack for dramatic purpose, often proving to be a moving experience once the tickled rib pain begins to subside. It's a picture as deep in human awareness as it is rich with comedy value.Andie MacDowell as Rita, Phil's producer and object of his lust throughout the story, proves to be surprisingly good foil for Murray's comedic ebullience. While elsewhere a number of reoccurring characters are performed memorably by the support cast (Stephen Tobolowsky and Chris Elliott standing out). Ramis keeps it brisk, never allowing the plotting to fold in on itself and the sound tracking is irritatingly catchy. But it's with the screenplay (Ramis and Danny Rubin) where ultimately Groundhog day is judged, be it the comedy or human interest, it's a zinger as written. And thankfully, with Murray at the top of his game, the brainy fun on the page is brought vividly to life on the screen. Groundhog Day, one of the finest comedies of the modern era. 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
"Within every man there's goodness, given enough time","One of the most well-known Bill Murray films, a movie that defined a whole subgenre of time travel fiction – the so called ""Groundhog Day Loop"" – while also being a sweet love story in its own right. Nowadays it's a loved classic, and for a good reason. Its premise is really rather simple, a man is forced to live out the exact day over and over again, but the film makers explore its possibilities to their fullest, giving us a tale about the meaning of human interaction, loneliness and the depths we can either sink or rise when there's no one to witness us.This is Bill Murray's film, through and through. His performance was the one that would either make or break the film, and he pulls it off magnificently. He gives us everything. The initial confusion, the horror of realization, the rage against the heavens, the joy of possibilities, the descend into monotony, the despair that comes with time, the strength to still move forwards. All this given with just the right amount of snark to keep the tone comedic, while also selling the depth of the story. I've never seen him show us more range and scale than in this movie.Andie MacDowell also shines as the female lead, and the various other actors give us a nice setting in the sleepy town of Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania. I don't think this film would have worked as well as it does now if the setting had been a larger city. Now you get to know the locale, the various inhabitants, which makes the humour and drama that much more poignant.Groundhog Day is a fantastic film. Its premise and idea are pure fantasy comedy, but it rounds it up with heavy doses of emotion and drama, while still keeping it lighthearted enough to entertain. And it's those few darker moments that make the overall film shine all that much brighter.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
Surprisingly Fun,"I was familiar with the trope this film brought to pop-culture before having watched the film itself, and I was perfectly surprised by how well the movie still works and holds up today. There is a certain feel to the movie that makes it feel firmly grounded in the early '90's, but, overtime, the movie may remain a classic.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
Star rating: 3 out of 5,"Groundhog Day has a great deal of potential, but ultimately fails to live up to its promise.  It isn't the concept that falls short; on the contrary, the plot is entertainingly original.  Self-centred reporter Phil Connors aims to leave Pennsylvanian backwater Punxsutawney as soon as possible after completing a story on the annual Groundhog Day Festival, but his plans are thwarted when he wakes the following morning and discovers that it's Groundhog Day again. . . . . . . . . . and again. . . . . . . . . Initially he sees this turn of events as akin to a nightmare, but soon realises that if there's no tomorrow, there are no hangovers and no consequences. . . . .. . . . .A storyline like this is very amusing per se, and there are some deft touches - such as Phil's audacious money-van heist, which succeeds simply because after innumerable Groundhog Days in succession, he knows Punxsutawney's routines so well.  Due to the inherent comedy Bill Murray's wisecracking attempts as Phil are unnecessary, they don't fit well with his character, and frankly someone making a face like a groundhog isn't that funny the first time, let alone meriting repetition.Although this is a comedy there are some genuinely thought-provoking issues raised - Phil learns (and through him we realise) that spontaneity can never be choreographed, and an impulsive moment's beauty lies in the fact that it 'just happens'.  The film's biggest downfall is its predictability.  Despite the various entertaining shenanigans en route, we just know that in the end Phil will have learned some Valuable Lessons and become a Nice Guy.Overall though, Groundhog Day is a likeable movie, and would leave the viewer with a much greater sense of satisfaction had it - instead of showing the happy couple running hand-in-hand through the freshly fallen snow - used a less trite finale.",5.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
"A famous movie critic was asked what movie deserves to last 100 years, and he said ""Groundhog Day""","A famous movie critic (who evidently wasn't famous enough for me to remember his name, sorry folks) picked ""Groundhog Day"" as the film most deserving to speak for our society 100 years from now. Director Harold Ramis humbly mentions this in the DVD interview before playing off the honor as essentially a happy mistake. He had no intent or expectation of making anything greater than a whimsical fantasy romcom. He definitely succeeded at making a wonderful romcom, but the more I think about it, the movie critic has a great point and if this flick is indeed the only 20th century film to survive a zombie apocalypse or two, hey I'm not complaining.Cleverly disguised as a breezy fantasy what-if comedy, ""Groundhog Day"" gives us a provocative allegory that would have Plato, Confucius, Buddha & Rod Serling scratching their collective heads and slapping their collective knees at the same time. The story is about a selfish louse ""Phil"" (Bill Murray) who finds himself trapped in a bizarre loop, living the same day over & over.Buddhists, Hasidic Jews, Hindus and Gnostics alike have agreed that this as a wonderful illustration of how reincarnation works (and hey any movie that can get all the religions to agree on something is pretty impressive). Meanwhile psychologists widely applaud this as a fine example of how psychoanalysis & treatment work by revisiting our memories and hopefully learning from them each iteration. Economists have published papers relating Groundhog Day to advanced concepts of ""equilibrium economics"". And last but not least, audiences the world over say this is a hilarious flick. The reason why I've dwelled on all this heady gobbledygook, rather than the plot, is just to entice and prepare you for a masterpiece.Ok if you're still with me, let's talk about the actual movie already. ""Phil"" is stuck living the same day over & over, and at the same time he's pursuing his love/lust interest ""Rita"" (Andie McDowell). Can you guess the problem? Yes, if every day resets & repeats itself in 24 hours, that means he has 24 hours to seduce the chick. He tries everything, but for some reason it never seems to work. At the same time, on a deep spiritual level (though Phil is about as spiritually inclined as a damp sponge) he begins to wonder what's the point of doing anything if everything amounts to the same reset/rewind. Phil goes through almost every emotion & philosophy in the book: hedonism, narcissism, nihilism, existentialism, fear, pleasure, rage, and--quite convincingly--a deep depression which Bill Murray pulls off perfectly without sacrificing the momentum of the comedy.Ultimately our protagonist ""Phil"" becomes the amalgamation of the human spirit, in all its triumphs, tragedies, arrogance and confusion. Watch this movie, and in between wiping back tears of laughter, you just may agree with that movie critic who says ""Groundhog Day"" is a film that should survive for the next 100 years.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"

Truly great,"Groundhog Day is an excellent movie. Few movies manage to make it up past an 8 on my scale, because a movie like that has to be more than just fun or entertaining. A 10 is a truly rare achievement. This film manages to be much more than just a story with a few laughs. It manages to encapsulate so much of what makes us human, AND how we could be better in the space of an hour and a half. That alone is a staggering achievement, but this movie does it without being pretentious or preachy unlike much of modern Hollywood cinema. This movie has a special self-awareness that many others lack. It shows that the writers and filmmakers knew how to laugh at themselves first. Through all of this, they convey a positive and heartwarming feeling. Don't just watch this one, feel it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
"The perfect comedy, with the perfect comedy actor","When weatherman Phil (Bill Murray) travels to a small town for its annual Groundhog Day, he ends up living the same day over and over again. At first, it is a curse, but he soon finds that he can use it to his advantage.I wish I could tell you why it's taken me over twenty-six years to watch 'Groundhog Day' but, in truth, there isn't a good reason. There's no excuse for being deprived of such a fantastically written, fantastically acted romantic comedy.Yeah. I liked it.There's no disputing how talented Bill Murray is – if you've seen Ghostbusters or Caddyshack (or even The Royal Tenenbaums for more contemporary audiences), you already know. This, though, is his tour-de-force. It's not often that he's given the chance to play a leading man, but he does it with ease. His chemistry with Andie MacDowell is brilliant, as is his interplay with the other actors in the film. We could talk about how good everyone else is, and they are good, but that would take away from Murray. This is his movie, and he deserves all the accolades.But the writing needs to be commended too. Despite the somewhat frothy nature of the film, it does tackle some very serious topics. The idea of death; of immortality; of ego; of man's place in the world; of love. Pretty heavy stuff, all aptly handled within this 100-or-so-minute light comedy.I could probably try and think of something to criticise, in the interest of balanced journalism. But I won't do that. This film is a joy to see, and that's exactly how it should be remembered. You just have to sit back and enjoy the ride.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
a great film,"Phil, a sarcastic weatherman from Pittsburgh, goes every year to a little ""hick town"" where he covers the Groundhog Day festival.  He hates it there, and can't wait to get out.

I thought that this movie didn't look like it was gonna be all that great, maybe a few laughs, but not the best comedy ever.I was wrong. This movie is funny, creative, heart-warming, clever, entertaining, funny, and um, really funny. Just when you think this movie is gonna ""run out of tricks"" it takes a new turn and ends up getting better and better. And then it makes you think.  The only movie of this type that comes close to Groundhog day, in my most humble opinion, is As Good As it Gets.     See Groundhog day.

Kinda repetitive tbh,I'm gonna assume that this is the original time loop typa movie and generally I don't think they're too great. This one was good I guess but nothing special. My main issues with these type of movies are the really small inconsistencies.Like surely even if the day itself repeats it would be impossible for it to happen the same way numerous times. For example on day 1 he chats to a dude and a lady for at least 2 minutes and then meets ned. But on the third day he walks past the lady and the dude yet still meets ned at the same spot as he's crossing the street. Also on top of my dislike of the subgenre while bill Murray was pretty good I wasn't a very big fan of the character himself. 7/10.,7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
"It's Like I Said, I Love This Film; I've Seen It Over a Hundred Times","Although I haven't counted, that quotation from Phil Connors, dressed as Bronco for a screening of ""Heidi II"" at the Alpine Theater, may not be an overstatement of my adoration for ""Groundhog Day."" Ironically, for a film about repeating the same, titular day ad infinitum, it's tantalizingly rewatchable. This goes beyond some fantastic wish fulfillment for power, immortality and perfection offered by the time loop. It's a romantic comedy that, among other things, explores the cinematic reflexivity of the time-travel movie while touching on grand philosophical and religious questions.""What would you do if you were stuck in one place, and every day was exactly the same, and nothing that you did mattered?""That about sums it up for the modern rom-com, a cinematic nadir, the same formula and tropes repeated over and over again. ""Groundhog Day,"" too, follows the genre closely. It's this distinctly Hollywood fiction that director Harold Ramis turned to in altering Danny Rubin's original scenario, which began in the midst of the time loop (although that's exactly what ""Palm Springs"" (2020) did, yet it, too, remains distinctly a rom-com.) Phil falls in the mythical movie notion of love at first sight seeing Rita, the producer, playing with the weather-man stage. He, as portrayed by Bill Murray, is the typical male protagonist in these things who is supposedly, initially unlovable, to the female counterpart character in the movie that is (Rita). As for movie-goers, he may be most beloved in this initial state--disarming the spectator's hesitation in accepting the illusory fluff with his funny and knowing cynicism. It becomes safe for us to suspend our disbelief without feeling like the ""hicks"" that Phil desires celebrating the February 2nd celebrations of Punxsutawney.While Murray is wonderful and perfectly cast, Andie MacDowell is also an inspired choice for the co-lead, or to put it more crassly, the prize for the male hero's successfully-completed quest. Such is the way these movies go. If he's the egotistical snob with ambitions of big-city reporting, she's the girl-next-door type, wholesome, accessible, good and pure, and all that 19th-century French poetry jazz. An important thing ""Groundhog Day,"" however, does well to avoid in the rom-com vein of ""When Harry Met Sally"" and other flicks in the Nora Ephron tradition is the friend and confidant--often a homosexual in subsequent versions--in which the romantic couple drone on and on to about their amorous foibles. Chris Elliott's Larry the cameraman is none of that--not even to the extent that Elliott served that role in ""There's Something About Mary"" (1998)--instead offering a comedic sidekick to react to and comment upon Murray's dry and caustic wit. A mediator between the protagonist and the spectator, in other words, which is especially apt given that he's the only character to control or share the perspective of the ultimate cinematic intermediary of the camera, whose view the spectator shares.We get the generic boy meets girl, boy loses girl, boy wins girl. But, along the way, through the time-travel gimmick, it's realized that ""We could do whatever we want."" By adopting these genre conventions, the picture is able to exploit them for a lot more fun than usual and to explore territory far more interesting, if not profound, than the usual pathetic movie idolization of yearning for intimacy, or ""love at first sight,"" ""true love"" and grand romantic gesture nonsense.""The wretch, concentred all in self""The time loop offers quite the framework for introspection. Not only for Phil, either, but for a reflection of film itself. It's one of my favorite possibilities offered by movie time travel, to reflexively exploit the same techniques and magic that comprise filmmaking. To edit characters and settings along the space-time continuum, reshooting repeatedly the same scenes with modifications, an actor playing a character acting so as to exploit the fabrication of the time loop. ""Groundhog Day"" does this better than maybe any other time-travel movie.When Phil tries to seduce Rita, the picture continues to cut to the next day as he learns something new about her to use. He finds that she always toasts to world peace despite asking what they should drink to (I know, how obnoxious, right?), for example, so the next go around, he suggests a prayer for it. His unique position makes him the film's surrogate editor. He's also an actor (Murray) playing a character (the wretch Phil) who is acting (Phil the suitor) to bed Rita. He succeeds at this earlier by learning his lines, ""Nancy, Lincoln, Walsh."" Ever the discerning producer, though, Rita isn't so easily fooled by an inauthentic performance. Hence Phil's transformation from acting to fully inhabiting, becoming the character he, also a character in the first place, was once only trying to pretend.Phil, Rita and Larry already work in the filmmaking business, or rather the small-screen TV biz of weather reports and local events coverage for a region's evening news broadcast. Phil, in particular, is involved in the most illusory aspect of this department, of a weatherman imagining the graphics projected on the green screen he performs in front of and putting his own spin on any scientific weather predictions (he arrogantly continues to claim, evidence mounting to the contrary, that the blizzard will push off to the East and hit Altoona instead). Note, too, how the camera tracks in towards one of these TV monitors as the film cuts to the crew traveling to Punxsutawney. This is why I don't mourn in the slightest the loss of Rubin's original beginning in the midst of the time loop, which doesn't begin until Phil is in the small Pennsylvanian borough. They enter the movie, through the screen, that is the Punxsutawney set and time-loop scenario.We get this with another analogy, too, that recalls another timeful classic, ""Back to the Future"" (1985). In that Robert Zemeckis production, Marty McFly and Doc Brown enter a shared dream through separate concussions--the teen with his loud music and the mad scientist falling from his toilet. Dreams as analogy for cinema. Something similar happens to Phil on his first day in Punxsutawney. At the height of his arrogance, requesting to be patched through on a telephone line for celebrities in an emergency, he's hit by a snow shovel. Yes, the weatherman who predicted the blizzard would pass by hit with a snow shovel. The rest of the movie, one could argue, is but a fever dream brought on by his freezing in that blizzard before becoming concussed from the blow to the head. He's always waking up in bed, as if from sleep, after all. Marty and Doc, too, videotape their fantastic journey through the DeLorean--just as Phil, Rita and Larry do at Gobbler's Knob, to be infinitely replayed, the weatherman caught on camera stuck in a storm of continuous doubling.This is further reflected by his double of another weatherman performing for an audience and named Phil, the groundhog, redoubled by his own shadow. I could even go on about the literalizing of the metaphoric cinematographic death of still images doubled from living movement represented by the doubled Phils driving to their doom, but I'll only say that I don't care if car explosions are an unrealistic cliché, as it's entirely appropriate if one considers that originally film, as nitrate, was notoriously inflammable--something realized in similar reflexive constructions from ""Frankenstein"" (1931) to ""Portrait of a Lady on Fire"" (2019). This is the reason to fear death even in the afterlife of cinema.""I'm a god; not the god, I don't think.""Religious scholars have had a field day and philosophy courses could be taught with ""Groundhog Day."" Mere comment on the human condition. Is it not only a film-within-a-film, but a Matrix-style simulation that Phil has been awakened to? Like Neo, he's a Christ figure--no matter how many times he dies, he will be resurrected on his path to redemption, and note that one of his suicides involves leaping crucifixion pose off a church. The film even begins and ends in the clouds, not only indicating the meteorological profession but also the heavens. Or is it Eastern-style religious reincarnation? Was that shovel to the head Karma? Is it not purgatory? Rita's Catholic, after all. But, good works matter, too. Then again, he's only a god. It's a tragicomedy of Greek proportions, of rebirth from descent to the underworld. Aristotelian poetics exemplified. Maybe a postmodern critique of a postmodern man returned to the simplicity of a Capraesque, ""It's a Wonderful Life"" (1946), American small town--albeit one who inevitably turns to refinement in poetry, piano playing and ice sculpture. Or a Nietzschean Übermensch, of eternal return, beyond good and evil. Surely there are even psychobabble explanations, and Phil does visit a shrink.Point is there is no cosmological explanation for the time loop--at least not beyond the narratology of the hero's journey and the rom-com genre. Not even the science-y locus found in ""Palm Springs"" and ""Edge of Tomorrow"" (2014) or rules of ""Back to the Future."" There's no point, no meaning, or maybe there is, but it never succumbs to base sentimentality or grandiosity. It's up to the spectator to interpret, but ""Groundhog Day"" offers a lot more to work with than one will find in one-off examples of the genres and conventions it incorporates, exploits and subverts. The groundhog and his shadow only forecast the length of winter if you believe it to be so--and even then not really. It's this multifold ambiguity and complexity shadowing the familiarly comedic and romantic that's timeless.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"

Groundhog Day was one of Harold Ramis' best movies as director,"So after 21 years of only hearing about this movie (though when I worked at a movie theatre at the time, I did manage to watch a few scenes here and there), I finally got to see the whole thing on Netflix disc with my mom who hadn't seen this when it was first released either. She was confused part of the time but she seemed to enjoy it while I knew about the living-the-same-day-over premise the whole time. It's funny seeing Bill Murray at first taking advantage of what he can get away with in going back to what it was before and then experiencing some depression in not going forward before redeeming himself in the process. Andie MacDowell is luminous as his eventual love interest. Chris Elliott has some moments near the end. Bill's brother Brian Doyle-Murray is appropriately boisterous as the groundhog spokesman. And Stephan Tobolowsky is a hoot as this Ned fellow Bill keeps encountering. Harold Ramis did fine as director and co-writer and he provides a nice commentary track on the DVD.

Another nice concept,"The movie's concept for its main conflict is really nice. Able to relive the same day over and over again magically seems to have it's own perks of repetition and learning from mistakes. Too bad that the concept is only developed into a meagerly interesting final product. I've seen Edge of Tomorrow, which uses the same concept, but it ends up better for me due to it took the concept into a more serious matter. Nevertheless this movie can still have good grip on its main concept and took it into quite a good story with nice repeated scenes. Too bad that the ending is only about love and nothing else. The acting overall is quite good for me. Bill Murray's acting is really suiting to his character's reluctance at things. Andie MacDowell did well to provide the balancing angle for the story",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
"One of the funniest and original ""philosophical"" comedies","This is one of the first movies I bought on DVD after the technology came out in 1997 in the U.S. It is an ideal movie to watch when one feels blue or down in the dumps. Its humorous script and scenes always give me many laughs. Besides the humorous situations Bill Murray's Phil gets into, this film has a distinct message. It is a morality play without being preachy. It lets us see the consequences of living a selfish hedonistic life versus a decent unselfish life. And, it's all done with great humor.The genius of Harold Ramis as a comedy writer is apparent in this film. Ramis wrote some of the funniest scripts of the last half of the 20th century (besides ""Groundhog Day"" – ""Caddyshack"" in 1980, ""Stripes"" in 1981, ""Ghostbusters"" in 1984 and others). The trivia section has an interesting item under the IMDb biography of Ramis. He and Bill Murray had a falling out over ""Groundhog Day"" that ended their collaboration on films. The item refers to an interview Ramis gave. He said the falling out was ""due to differing views on what the film should be about (Murray wanted it to be more philosophical, Ramis wanted it to be a comedy)."" That seems sad and ironic because this film turned out to be such a great philosophical comedy.I don't know if anyone else has tried to count the number of times that Phil wakes up to the same day, Feb. 2 in this film. The advantage of a DVD makes it a little easier to do that; but still, some of the repetitious scenes flash so quickly that it takes some effort, and sitting through the film a few times to try to nail down the number. My count is 39 times, with the 40th occurrence being Feb. 3. If we were to figure how much time it would take Phil to learn the things he does – French poetry, playing the piano, ice sculptor, and to do all the good deeds he does, who knows how many days that would take in reality. A big majority of the scenes are his failures that also provide much of the humor. But, toward the end of those, the sense of futility that we viewers begin to feel starts to wear on the humor. So, the filmmakers timed it perfectly and at that point Phil is inspired to turn around – by something that Rita says. Andie MacDowell plays Phil's TV producer, Rita, very well; and Chris Elliott is very good as Larry, the cameraman.Phil's repeated days probably would have totaled a year or more. The only incongruity in the logic of the plot is at the end. But, without it, the film ending wouldn't make sense. The one characteristic throughout the film up to that point is that only Phil has his days repeated. To everyone else, it's Feb. 2 for the first and only time. And, every day Phil begins with the knowledge (lessons) of the previous repeated days. The accumulation of the days and their experiences explains how Phil can progress from one day to the next when he begins to read, study, play the piano, etc. Of course, some scenes would be a little different over time – i.e., Phil being able to play the piano a little better on succeeding days with his piano teacher, played by Peggy Roeder.So, for the final February 2, all the people whom Phil has encountered on his many repeated days of Feb. 2 now know him fairly well. It's not likely that he would have been able to do all of what he did in one day, so now all the other characters also have a cumulative memory of days knowing Phil in the past. As I said, it's the only way it makes sense. I wouldn't normally dissect a film this much, but ""Groundhog Day"" is such a unique concept for a movie that it invites this sort of circumspection and analysis.Here are a few choice lines that alone give a laugh each time. Phil, ""Out in California, they'll have warm weather tomorrow gang wars and some very overpriced real estate. Up in the Pacific Northwest, as you can see, they're going to have some very tall trees.""Phil, ""Do you ever have déjà vu, Mrs. Lancaster."" Mrs. Lancaster, ""I don't think so, but I could check with the kitchen.""On the phone in his room, Phil: ""Yeah, sport. I know there's a blizzard. When are the long distance lines gonna be repaired? Well, what if there is no tomorrow? There wasn't one today . Hello?  Hello?""Phil, ""What would you do if you were stuck in one place  and every day was exactly the same, and nothing you did mattered?"" Ralph, ""That about sums it up for me.""Gus, ""Hey, Phil. If we wanted to hit mailboxes, we could let Ralph drive.""The dinner scene with Rita is a riot when Phil asks her what she is looking for in a man. She describes admirable traits, and Phil says, ""Me  me  me."" She describes some more, and Phil answers, ""Me  me . Me."" Rita, ""He's not afraid to cry in front of me."" Phil, ""This is a man we're talking about, right?"" Rita, ""He likes animals, children, and he'll change poopy diapers."" Phil, ""Does he have to use the word, 'poopy?'"" Rita, ""Oh, and he plays an instrument, and he loves his mother."" Phil, ""I am really close on this one. Really, really close.""""Groundhog Day"" is one of the best comedies of all time.

Kind of a nineties film with an eighties heart,"You know, I can't say anything more than everybody else already said, funny movie with excellent performances, solid direction and a sharp script.

I very quickly look down on unintelligent people and I won't associate with fools. I'm pretty direct in my speech.

Let's be better people,"""Groundhog Day"" is not as funny as I remembered, but is still a solid old-style romantic comedy with a warm atmosphere. The time loop plot device is simple but effective, even though the execution is not always successful: way too extreme when Phil turns into a better person, way too mild when he tries to live by the day and break the rules. The positive message and moral are well conveyed while still keeping a lighthearted, disengaged tone. Almost like a modern ""Christmas Carol"", with the exception that Phil's transformation does not happen overnight. Well, technically it DOES happen overnight, but from the characters' perspective, it actually took months, if not years, to go through a process of self-awareness, acceptance, and self-improvement.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"

an unbelievable classic that just gets better as you rewatch it,"Back in the mid-1990s, we had a friend named Jeff, who started talking to us rather oddly.

One of the great comedies of the decade,"In a decade pathetically short of great comedies, this is one of the few stand-outs. While many critics and users have commented on the film's existentialism and intelligence, the truth is it is also genuinely laugh-out-loud funny, something many intelligent dark comedies can't seem to manage. Although Bill Murray is almost always good in supporting roles, his lead roles have been notoriously uneven (""Ghostbusters"" and ""Stripes"" vs. ""Quick Change"" and ""The Man Who Knew Too Little""). This, however, is clearly one of his greatest roles, and he obviously has fun playing it. Best of all, the film is truly original (ironically, a film about repetitiveness is different from anything else you've ever seen). Although it has been mostly overlooked in its own time, there is no doubt in my mind that, years from now, this will be recognized as one of the great films of the decade, if not the century.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"

Every day like the one before...,"GROUNDHOG DAY is really a jigsaw puzzle of a film. Are we supposed to believe that somehow fate decrees that for punishment you must relive every day like the one before--if you are judged to be a rude enough person in need of redemption? A pretty shaky premise for any comedy/fantasy--and yet, the amazing thing about GROUNDHOG DAY is that it succeeds despite the flawed premise.There are numerous twists and turns in the plot--totally unexpected and welcome--otherwise, with the story heading in the same direction day after day, things could have become pretty monotonous. That pitfall is avoided by spicing up the story with just the little differences that make for some brilliant comic touches.BILL MURRAY is quite acceptable here as the unprincipled weather man who decides to change his ways--rather improbably, I might add--and alter the course of his life. ANDIE MacDOWELL is pleasing enough as the woman he falls in love with, although never one of my favorite actresses. And others in the cast keep the comedy on a high level throughout much of the running time.Summing up: Improbable fantasy never explains why Murray suffers this strange fate--but it maintains interest and the screenplay has enough originality to keep it fresh.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"

A nice comedy but Time Loop could have been used logically and intellectually.,"Groundhog Day (1993) :
Brief Review -A nice comedy but Time Loop could have been used logically and intellectually. A well known 90s film is entitled to deliver something upfront, at least that's what i believe, and that's how Groundhog Day comes in my watchlist. If not for that reason i would have never watched it and saved that time to watch any full proofed classic film. Groundhog Day comes with an impressive storyline of Time Loop which might have been fascinating in early 90s especially when the narrative and character aren't cold, suspenseful but are instead happy faces bringing laughters. But does that storyline make it extraordinary? The answer is no. I tell you why. The first big reason is, Groundhog Day failed to mix up fiction and real life theories, 2nd it failed to generate something important and intellectual, 3rd is it failed to show some logic. Why did it happen or how did it suddenly stop? Nobody knows the answer and they didn't even try to give an answer. Did they use Time Loop to discover philosophy of Life? Why, big No. This was an opportunity to deliver something socially responsible sort of thing but in Groundhog Day the protagonist was more focused about his own Love and lust interests. This theme of getting chance to relive the same day again and again deserved better writting where you could put joy, happiness and awareness etc and you get chance to change things according to consequences but there was nothing sort of that in the film. Bill Murray was charming and funny as always, Andie MacDowell looked somehow beautiful in some scenes and Chris Elliot did better than expected. Harol Ramis's filmography doesn't point towards any Cult Classic so all you expect from his film is one time popcorn flick in which Groundhog Day fits by all means. Any given day I would watch it just to pass the time but never as a Classic. Good but Overrated!RATING - 6/10*By - #samthebestest",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"

A film with great repeat value.,"As I type, the past 4 months have been spent in lockdown because of coronavirus, every day seeming like groundhog day. It's thanks to this film that the phrase 'groundhog day' is even in my lexicon, having come to mean 'a situation in which a series of unwelcome or tedious events appear to be recurring in exactly the same way'.In director Harold Ramis's charming romantic comedy, Bill Murray portrays obnoxious TV weatherman Phil Connors, who, while reporting from the small town of Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, finds himself living the same day over and over again. At first he is shocked and dismayed; then he tries using the inexplicable phenomenon to his advantage, gradually learning all about his pretty producer Rita (Andie MacDowell) so that he can woo her; after repeatedly failing to score, a despondent Phil commits suicide in several different ways, but eventually learns how to be a better person and finally gets to see tomorrow, with Rita by his side.With a set-up like this, in which it is necessary for many scenes to be repeated several times, there's the very real danger that boredom will set in, so it is testament to Ramis's sharp script and the great performances from his likeable cast that this never happens. Each repetition cleverly builds on the one before, with small but brilliant changes that ensure the film stays fresh, engaging and very funny throughout. Take Phil's repeated encounter with insurance salesman Ned Ryerson, for example: each meeting begins exactly the same way, but the manner in which the weatherman reacts each time is unique, ranging from awkward, to irritated, to violent, to overly friendly, to genuinely kind (it doesn't hurt that Stephen Tobolowsky as Ned is freaking hilarious).Groundhog Day is also one of those rare movies that touches the soul as well as tickling the funny bone: Phil's transformation from intolerable cynic to much-loved member of the community could melt even the coldest of hearts, Murray putting in what has to be the best comedic performance of his career (with Ernie McCracken from Kingpin a close second).Now considered one of greatest comedies of the '90s, if not of all time, Groundhog Day is one of those films that deserves to be seen time and time again. The title might be used to describe a monotonous, unpleasant, and repetitive situation, but watching the film could never be anything less than a hugely enjoyable experience.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"

The ultimate 80's-style comedy!,"GROUNDHOG DAY (1993) continues the tradition of 80's-style comedies such as THE BLUES BROTHERS (1980), GHOSTBUSTERS (1984) and SCROOGED (1988), although there is a major difference. This one is based on an amazing concept, and has much more ambitious, existentialistic themes, almost in the vein of art-house movies, yet without ever feeling pretentious. It manages to be as thought-provoking and clever as movies by Stanley Kubrick, Michael Haneke or Lars von Trier, but it's told in such a light manner that it's much easier to grasp for mainstream audiences. Therefore it's able to almost sneak its themes in on those, who perhaps aren't normally used to thinking about the movies they watch. To me that's a great accomplishment in itself. GROUNDHOG DAY shows how we shouldn't take the important things for granted, that we should make the most of the time we are given on Earth, and that if the world feels like a terrible place, the changes must come from within yourself.It's a movie which different people will interpret different meanings from. It tells the story of Phil Connors (Bill Murray), an arrogant and egocentric TV weatherman, who goes on an assignment in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, where he mysteriously gets forced to live through the same day over and over, apparently with no possibility to break the loop. This gives him the opportunity to explore life without consequences. At first he takes advantage of his situation by stealing money, becoming a drunk, and even committing suicide. Yet Phil soon realizes that his hostility towards the world isn't really because of the world, it's because of himself. The lesson is that he must change within to get together with his dream-woman and live happily ever after. Phil is not supposed to make her like him, he's supposed to make himself a likable guy. If you are constantly angry at the world then search within yourself, because that's most likely where the problem exists.GROUNDHOG DAY is Harold Ramis's greatest movie yet. It far exceeds his other comedies, which are funny movies, but without the grandiosity of this one, in terms of the unique idea and themes. Of course Danny Rubin's ingenious manuscript has to receive credits as well, as it is basically the premise of the whole movie. Bill Murray, who is one of my favorite actors, is perfect as the Phil Corners character. Murray is able to express more than thousands of words with his eyes, and his sense of irony is fully exploited. The cameo-roles are full of comedic character-actors such as Chris Elliott, Harold Ramis (the director) and Stephen Tobolowsky. Pure genius! 10/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"

"Good, but hardly great","I'm not saying that this movie isn't funny... quite the contrary. But so many claim that it's great, almost a masterpiece... why? It starts out very good, with Bill Murray being his typical, sarcastic, at times deadpan self, and continue being so for a good while... but somewhere, about halfway through the movie, the films pace suddenly slows ridiculously down and we're suddenly not watching a comedy with Murray's sharp wit and excellent delivery, but rather a typical early 90's romantic comedy. Why couldn't this film break that damn barrier? Why does there always have to be romance? I know, I know, us humans have quite an insatiable lust and longing for love, but can't we think of something more original and constructive to put in movies? The film gets better a little later, with Murray doing more fun stuff again... and the plot is now turned around. The first half of the film is Murray doing what he feels like, pleasing himself, the latter half if him serving other people, pleasing others. This works well, and there are some funny moments in both parts(though there are far more in the first). But the whole romance subplot... I don't know, maybe it's because it's Andie MacDowell, the queen(well, one of them... another good example would be Julia Roberts, but she's done more versatile roles) of annoying romantic comedies. Why, oh why must there always romance in movies like this? Hell, the movie could have gotten an 8 from me, or possibly even a perfect 10, if it had kept up the great entertainment of the first half. Some of the movie also seems to drag a bit, since we're basically just watching the same thing over and over again... but with tiny alterations every once in a while. The plot is good, but the romance subplot sucks. The pacing is OK. The acting is somewhat good... but the only actor that impressed me was Bill Murray... and even he was portraying the exact same character that he always does. The characters are well-written... to a extent. The humor is good. All in all, the movie is worth watching and good, but it's by no means great. I recommend it to fans of Bill Murray and *shudder* romantic comedies. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
Comedic perfection,"I'd been wanting to watch Groundhog Day for some time, but it was only when I ordered the Blu-Ray version a couple of days ago that I could finally sit down and watch the bloody film. I'd heard a lot of stuff about it, I had seen a couple of scenes in cable (never managed to finish the movie for a diversity of reasons), but I'd never seen the movie.Well, now I have. And I definitely don't regret the experience.It's no mystery that Bill Murray is one of the most gifted comedians... no, wait, scratch that, gifted actors in modern cinema. He is funny in a way that one doesn't realize he is actually being funny until you listen to what he is saying. He doesn't depend on wacky mannerisms or profanity in order to make audiences laugh; it's his matter-of-factly delivery of lines and the actual lines that he says that make him so funny. Most comedies he's done are pretty great - including, of course, Groundhog Day -, and even some of the mediocre films he's done get elevated by his presence.Now, Groundhog Day has a complicated premise, but it deals with it in a very simple, straightforward manner that nevertheless makes one think, laugh and admire what the filmmakers are conveying. Weatherman Phil Connors (Murray) is in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania. It's February the 2nd. And it's Groundhog Day - a day he hates so much, he only comes to the Pennsylavian town to do his work and leave immediately before he kills himself. This day is different, though, much to his concern - time has seemed to stop, and he's reliving this same dreaded day over and over again, indefinitely. He's definitely not crazy, but how can he tell anyone, even his co-workers Rita (Andie McDowell) and Larry (Chris Elliot) about his current situation? The thing about Groundhog Day is that it's got a really smart premise and that it doesn't mess with it. Although it avoids many potentially-grim possibilities, it nevertheless explores a lot of things Phil could do with his new powers - memorize everything that happens in town, kill himself and doing illegal stuff without suffering the consequences, trying to conquer Rita's love, and many more. I liked the movie because it's both smart and funny, and the humour it provides with is intelligent enough and diverse enough for all audiences to enjoy the film. There's no place for bathroom jokes and profanity in this movie - in fact, this is one film that proves comedies don't have to be R-rated in order to be hilarious.I also like that it doesn't provide with any explanations for Phil's predicament - after all, this is a comedy, and since we see everything from Phil's point of view and he doesn't really have a way of learning the reason for the time loop, then the audience doesn't have to know it either. Instead of focusing on the scientific aspect of the story, the movie provides with something more humane, something more basic. It deals with romance, comedy, everyday-situations being repeated - in subtly different ways - over and over again and, of course, the redemption of Murray's character, who starts the movie as a total creep and ends it as a wiser, gentler man. My God, i's almost as if he's learned a lesson! Does saying that he earns Rita's heart constitute as a spoiler? I don't think so. I believe the viewer actually expects this to happen, and is simply waiting to see how it will happen.Groundhog Day is a masterwork, not only because it delights on a technical level, but also because it's one of those few comedies that manages to touch tickle the funny bone and touch the heart. It isn't formulaic by any means - although it does fulfill some expectations most members of the audience might have - and, despite being a little longer than most comedies, it never feels tiresome or overlong. Considering most comedies nowadays are either boring retreads or R-rated endeavors (which are really funny on their own right - see Tropic Thunder or Pineapple Express) that can't be enjoyed by the whole family, it's always a good idea to watch such a clean, fun and particularly smart movie like Groundhog Day.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"

Bill Murray is a great actor and gives his best. You see his perfect play very good in the scene when they build the snowman the second time - the constrained way he acts, when he falls down to the ground and tries to come closer to Rita as naturally as the day before.

My humble Groundhog Day opinion,"I really like this movie.....I saw it years after it came out, and I admit ""The Razor's Edge"" (also a Bill Murray movie) is another of my favorites. However, I think that for some reason, the people that gravitate toward this film also tend to be ""karma sympathizers"", slightly Hindu, or at least appreciate the spiritual parallels.If someone as cynical as Bill (Phil) can be redeemed on the day where for thousands of years, a small little animal has to choose between the dark and the light, than anyone watching knows they too can go out and be a better person. I had forgotten it was Paxsutawney Phil's day to shine till I looked at the news today, but just remembering that film, and its story line makes me want to go out and do something nice for my kids today. Maybe we'll go get cocoa before dance lessons- the sun is shining here! Happy Candlemas/Groundhog day to all...MM",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"

Say ""6:00"" is the moment of birth. and you have the story of what we are all about!Bill has many many things to learn. It gives a great view of the process and ""the only way out"". Not suicide, not cleverness, but ""forgetting yourself"" and spending your life in beauty in order to help other people. There are limits to this, as the ""poor old man"" shows.The moment he accepts his faith and starts to help other people he is on his way out. There is a smile on his face.

The greatest film comedy of all-time,"This is not only the greatest comedy of all time but one of the best films ever, in any genre. What makes it so great, besides a stellar performance by Bill Murray (which is, hands down, his best screen work to date) is how perfectly the script has been worked out, down to the tiniest little details. The premise is a solid one - a man is doomed to relive the same day over and over again until he learns how to become a better, less self-centered person. But it could have failed on so many levels: the built-in repetition factor could easily have sunk the film, and a very real danger existed that the situation would simply become as boring and infuriating to the audience as it is to the main character. The filmmakers - director Harold Ramis and his co-writer Danny Rubin, who came up with the original story - find several ingenious ways to ring changes upon the premise, and do a totally convincing job in mapping out the growth and development of the main character.That character is a cruel and shallow Pittsburgh weatherman named Phil Connors who is disgusted to find himself once again in Punxsatawney Pennsylvania to cover the dreaded (to him) groundhog day festival. By being forced to live the day again and again, amongst people he despises, he will have to come to terms with his own shallowness and lack of human connection. The film, then, is his quest for personal redemption and deliverance. If that sounds heavy to you, well . . . it is, sort of. While the film is clearly a comedy (and is very very funny), it does not hesitate to display the horror and desperation of Phil's predicament. By the end, you FEEL for him, and have come to know him, in a way that just would not be possible if his situation was played only for laughs. If ever a movie wrung every last drop of greatness and potential out of its central premise, it is this one. If nothing else, the script should have been up for an Academy Award; it is - hands down - the best comedy script of the 90s.Of course, probably the biggest concern is that the audience will enjoy Phil being a crumb much more than they will watching him become a nice guy, which would pretty much undercut the central theme of the movie. This is where Bill Murray's amazing performance comes in to play, since he's equally entertaining as a good-hearted and reformed man as he is as a jaded cynic. This is no mean accomplishment, and it's absolutely essential for the movie's success: if he came across as too nice, then we wouldn't buy the character's initial misanthropy, making the ""transformation"" a foregone conclusion; equally, if his change into a happier, more well-adjusted person wasn't funny and enjoyable in its own right, then we'd walk away thinking ""The movie had a great first hour - then it got boring as he started to change."" Either eventuality would have absolutely killed this picture.Fortunately, Murray - perhaps unique among screen comics - has always been equally adept at working either side of the sweet / sour divide. He can just as easily be lovable as despicable, and get laughs doing both. I can't really think of any other comic actor who can do this (Robin Williams is always relentlessly cheery; Steve Martin is funniest when he's angriest; Jim Carrey couldn't get laughs by being sweet and sincere if his life depended on it, etc.). Therefore, the movie is unthinkable without him. But it is also an absolute gift to him - no other film he has ever done has allowed him to show this much range as an actor while still letting him play to his strengths. Anyone who witnessed him trying to go dramatic in The Razor's Edge, or to bring off a similar grump-turns-into-a-nice-guy premise in the atrocious Scrooged will know exactly what I mean.To sum up, this is one of the best films ever, and belongs on that short list of works that are truly uplifting and heartwarming - but which EARN it. As ""transformation"" movies go, it's right up there with the seasonal classics of Scrooge, the Grinch and George Bailey in ""It's A Wonderful Life"" - all without the benefit of the Christmas season for its backdrop. In fact, one of the best things about Groundhog Day is that it might actually start a new trend - showing this film every year on TV in the wastes of February would be a good idea, when we could all really use a good cheering up!",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
"Great actors, some funny lines, but too sophisticated plot","I had seen this movie when it came out in the beginning of 1990ies, but I did not remember much of it. Only the fact that Murray and MacDowell are great actors. I am still of the opinion, although Murray's role in this movie is more significant - more than in his other movie where he stars excellently - ""Lost in Translation"". However, at times, windings of the plot are difficult to monitor and there are not too many scenes you can really laugh - and they are all related to Murray's lines. The best scene is where Murray is driving mad the car with two local rednecks and gives his views on life and future. The romantic angle with MacDowell is similar to most of movies with Meg Ryan. In short, recommendable within an intelligent community, not to be watched as a comedy in a loud and drinking group :)",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
"Very Good, but not the Greatest","IMDB commentators seem to rate this movie up there with the very, very best. I think it is very good, but not the greatest.The idea of reliving the same day is unusual yet simple.  It does have a philosophical conundrum buried in it, but at heart this is a romantic comedy with a twist.  It is not philosophy sugar-coated as romantic comedy.  In other words, if you want a good philosophical think, read some Bertrand Russell instead.There are some very entertaining scenes - the bowling alley debate and the ""Thelma & Louise""-esque scene with Bill Murray and the groundhog especially coming to mind as ""laugh-out-louders"".If you haven't seen it, then treat yourself to an hour-and-a-half of escapism and laughter, because that's what Groundhog Day is.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
A strangely addictive movie to watch!,"When I first saw this film on the website here and read the plot summary, I couldn't believe a movie about a weather man living the same day over and over again could have such high ratings. Well, after watching it, I can see why! Groundhog Day is somewhat like Charles Dickens' A Christmas Carol; it begins with Phil, a cynical, pessimistic, arrogant weatherman, and ends with a cheerful guy who has learned what matters most in life. How the hell did he change?Well, poor Phil somehow finds himself trapped reliving the same day, February 22nd, over and over again. There's no escaping it; he's stuck in the boring little town of Gobbler's Nob with a lot of eccentric people and the two colleagues he doesn't seem to care for very much. As time goes by, it sees as if he's lost his sanity, especially when he begins breaking the law for cheap thrills and committing suicide (he just wakes up unharmed), but he begins to fall for his co-worker Rita, someone he's always seen as sort of a ditz, as he learns that she's actually a very smart and interesting person. He also tries to be a better person and begins to care more about the lives of others, something very unusual for him.It's hard to explain this movie and how it's so effective, you have to see it for yourself to be honest with you.

A classic that was in my watchlist for so long and I finally got to watch it on 8th Dec 24,"I'm a fan of time-loop fantasy films. After watching About Time yesterday (which I rated a solid 10/10), I decided to revisit Groundhog Day. While it's undeniably a classic, I'd give it a 7/10, and here's why.There's something about '90s films-their slower pace, richer textures, and substance-that makes them stand out. Groundhog Day is no exception. It's witty and inventive, with ideas you don't see in films like Happy Death Day or Naked. Unlike many modern movies, which focus on unpredictable twists, this film carries a thoughtful message about life, love, and personal growth.The pencil-break test is a simple but clever moment, and Phil pretending to know Rita's preferences is an example of well-intentioned storytelling. Scenes like Phil jumping off a building are beautifully shot, and the dialogue is sharp throughout. The film doesn't just use themes like death and love as background elements-they hold real weight. Phil, who starts off as detestable, slowly grows on you. Watching his evolution makes it clear how Groundhog Day has inspired so many time-loop stories since.That said, the film felt too long. While it explores Phil's loop in detail, it drags before finally diving into the romance-something that was obvious from the start. Maybe it's a generational gap, but I found myself yawning midway through. And while Phil's transformation is compelling, I couldn't ignore the power imbalance in his dynamic with Rita.Overall, Groundhog Day is worth watching, especially to see where the time-loop genre got its start. It's a thoughtful, well-made film, but the pacing and outdated dynamics keep it from being a personal favorite.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
All around solid,"All around the drama and comedy mixes quite well in this movie. While the first half definitely leans more into the comedic aspects I was surprised and impressed with how far the idea of being stuck in one day would go. Watching Bill Murray act and change through the movie from a cynical egomaniac to someone who understands how his actions effect people and strive to be better. While I enjoyed the story nothing particularly stuck out to me as impressive when it came to the camerawork, set design, or soundtrack was just okay. It took me quite awhile to come around to the main character but by the end I was satisfied.",5.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
Hysterical and entertaining.,"I dare say that ""Groundhog Day"" changed the face of comedy. The whole concept behind it is ingenious. One man, living the same day over and over again, eventually decides to make the most of it and he is changed forever.This movie is genuinely funny and it can't help being so. What person wouldn't find that concept funny? Even if it gets annoying eventually, it remains funny in the pit of your stomach because Phil is such a jerk in the beginning that it's hard to feel sorry for him. When we start to see his transformation, we see something that hits home for all of us: he is misunderstood. He wants to quit and turn back into a jerk. But eventually, even Phil Connors pulls through.Proof that given the chance, pretty much anyone can find happiness. It's all in your mindset. A surprisingly powerful message hidden in this comedy gem that will make you wet your pants and keep you so interested you won't bother changing until the movie is over.9 out of 10, kids.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
Atmospheric to the max!,"I've always appreciated and valued atmosphere in movies, video games, music or you name it over other elements.

Add three main protagonists with different characters. Spice it up with romance elements and direct the whole thing into delivering a strong existential message in a funny and entertaining way. There you have it: Groundhog Day.The main reason why I liked this movie so much is because it brilliantly balances between being serious and amusing. It can make you think about most pertinent questions to us in general as well as more private ones; it can make you giggle. It's not as if some scenes are funny while other dead serious. Writers of this masterpiece where somehow able to make every scene contain both sides. It's as if you were laughing and thinking about the matter at the same time.Let me finish with a philosophical thought. One who is able to sanctify even the worse can fully enjoy the best.

He loves her but can he make her love him?This film is funny, it's beautiful and it's touching.

Fall-Down Funny and Touching,"Of all of the films that span the career of Bill Murray, I may have found my all-time favorite. Groundhog Day is a heartwarming film. A true one, not some clichéd schmaltz you normally associate romantic comedies with. This, to me, is in the same league as Capra. The best film made by the late, great, Harold Ramis. It starts out as the sarcastic comedy that Murray and Ramis are known for (in the vein of Ghostbusters). Then it turns into a psychological dark comedy, of which we follow Phil's decent into madness in cheery Punxsutawney. Then, a romantic comedy, that pays tribute to that age old premise of going back in time, to get the girl. C'mon, you've all had that desire. Then, something really special happens. We see Phil, not only mastering his sensitivity with women, but with humanity, period. Suddenly, Murray transforms into the world's greatest good samaritan, after spending so much time taking advantage of everyone. This is what you call, ingenious story and character development. It's wholesome, but not saccharine. It's incredibly funny and really, unexpectedly touching.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"

Great comedy-philosophical drama,"Groundhog day may seem tame by today's standards- but remember this was the film that started the whole time relapse continuum in the first place. However, just a concept cannot carry a film and this is where Groundhog succeeded and many others failed- It had a heart and a good story. Bill murray plays a weather reporter who must relive the same day- groundhog day every day.

One of those movies ...which could have been much better....,"I shall not try to conceal my disappointment when it comes to this movie. In a way though I knew something like this would would happen. A seriously well thought out plot and some good performances by the cast weren't enough to raise this movie's stature in my eyes to the extent that it be voted among the top 250 movies of all times.All said and done though , I shall commence my analysis.The DirectionA typical early 90's flick and hence had that pseudo feel good vibe around it, found in most light romantic movies of that time. The director could have done much better with the story handed out to him . Some parts were hastily executed were others were rubbed on for too long .The ScreenplayIt was the screenplay which disappointed me the most. The dialogues were sparingly funny. Wit was evidently absent . Many lines were repetitive and proved highly unbecoming for the plot. I mean , none of the actors had show stealers given to them.The ActingBill Murray is a veteran . But that fact does not by itself imply that he is extraordinary . A fine actor with good facial expressions and body language , he surely is. The driving force of the movie , undoubtedly.Andy McDowell does fine as a clichéd yet for some reason attractive leading lady .The support staff is equally decent (not more not less).The StoryGood. Actually great. In that it captures all those finer emotions of a life ; It deals with actual dilemmas and Bill Murray's acting and Make Up actually serve the story well. Most Importantly , only faint references to sex. No Nudity or any overtly sexual scenes , no profanities. Perhaps this is why it is so popular. A clean and neat family movie.Why I gave it 7 .For me the movie is undoubtedly neat and clean ( a relief , after a long time) and that is important. The fact that the movie pulls along at a nice rate and tempo without the use of profanities or explicit scenes (despite being a highly rated comedy movie) is itself commendable.On the whole a decent family flick but according to me could have been better , for the position it occupies in the Top 250 list.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
"Best Flick Ever, had me ROTFL","This movie was the most clever comedy ever written. The do-over style story telling just kept building with no climax in sight. I just could not focus on this whole film the first time because of the tears in my eyes. Bill Murray already was a great name to add to the cast. He has been a top A-list actor in several comedies and dramas up to the point of this flick. His deadpan approach to his character just brought a realistic scenario to the out-of-this-world story line. The cast selected balanced out his nonchalant personae just right. If I could give it 100 stars out of 10 I would. Not only will it be tough to beat this films comedy style, but it will be tough to cast someone as brilliant as Bill.

A must see,"It seems to me to be an impossible task to add anything new to the rave reviews this film has received but I'll try.This was made ten years before ""Lost In Translation"" and Bill Murray gets his true first chance to stretch his acting muscles and give us an extraordinary performance as Phil Connors, a careless, arrogant, egotistical weather man.Every year he sets out for Groundhog Day in Puxatawney, Pennsylvania, to catch his namesake coming up and casting a shadow (or not) for 6 more weeks of winter. Phil doesn't even bother to conceal his contempt for all that surrounds him, including his TV audience.Aye, but here's the rub. This year, Phil is destined to repeat this day over and over until he gets it right. Once it dawns on him that he is in an endless spin cycle of the same twenty four hours, he keeps experimenting with it, playing with it, even resorting to killing himself a few times, knowing that he will wake up again the following day and it will be Groundhog Day all over again.Bill brings an incredibly nuanced performance to the transformation of Phil. Andie McDowell (whom I normally despise and put her in the same one-note class as Mary Steenbergen, all hair and non-stop-come-hither eyes) as Rita, his producer who is completely turned off by Phil, plays well against him. But it is not about getting the girl at all.And this is where the movie aims for an incredible target, that of inner transformation for the sake of that transformation alone. In hands other than those of Harold Ramis (who has a small role in the movie also) this lofty ideal could have crashed and burned, but here it is extraordinary to see this egotistical man become of value to himself, tiny step by tiny step.He takes this endless eternity of the same day and starts to learn ice sculpture, piano playing, CPR, among other things. We don't have to see many of his attempts on screen and we are slowly made aware that he has befriended many in the town and is needed every day for aid and comfort and even life saving work.None of the points we observe are two by fours over the head. I would actually use the word ""Profound"" about this film. There is much to mull over, how are we all spending our days, could we be of more value to those around us but more importantly to ourselves if we took the time to become aware.Inspiring on all levels, superlative in both its comic and romantic genius, this film is up there in my 100 best of all time. The message lingers. A must see. 9 out of 10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"

Worthy of annual viewings,"Doesn't everybody know this one? Bill Murray plays a generally bitter, unpleasant weatherman who turns on the charm while the cameras roll but tumbles backward into mean, icy sarcasm just as soon as he's out of the frame. Forced to relive the same day on an endless loop, a much-loathed Groundhog's Day on-location report, he slowly works through his issues, loses the chip on his shoulder, finds personal fulfillment and learns how to share a meaningful moment. It's a simple idea, thoughtfully explored, that doesn't run short on heart, ideas or surprises. Murray is perfect in the role, able to convincingly evolve from contemptible jerk to charismatic goofball, but it's the in-between steps that really make his journey remarkable. His growth doesn't come without pains and struggles, missteps and setbacks, and we share his agony over those tough lessons and bitter disappointments. By the time his sentence in that circular purgatory is at an end, he's hit rock bottom, explored his darkest impulses, reached out for salvation, failed, improved and found peace within himself. Andie MacDowell is adorable as Murray's co-star, the ever-optimistic, spritely target of our affections, while director Harold Ramis gives the whole package a warm, friendly sensibility that keeps things on the up-and-up and still allows some wickedly dark material to sneak through. A fantastic, character-driven comedy with laughs to spare and sweet, enduring lessons to teach.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
"A great, great movie","Warnig Spoliers.A true gem of a movie, that I was very pleased with after the first viewing and has never disappointed since.  The concept of the film, reliving the same day again and again, is a solid one and the filmmakers make the most of it.  Director/writer Harold Ramis and co-writer Danny Rubin take the story of a curmudgeonly weather forecaster trapped perpetually in the same day from a cleverly set up beginning to a fitting terminus.  They intertwine the repetitions of the eternal day with the vicissitudes of our reluctant subject and produce a work that is both smart and filled with jeu d' esprit. Add the comic genius of Bill Murray and the strong support of Andie MacDowell and Chris Elliot and you have a notable comedy.Of course I must admit that the very idea of reliving a day is a reoccurring fantasy of mine, as I'm sure it is with many.  The old wish, `if I could just go back and redo that' is in essence I guess a way to deal with regret and reconsideration of moments passed.  That is why films such as this and `Family Man' and `Disney's The Kid' have such an appeal.  The difference between those films and this one is that I could not find any room for improvement here.  A rare strong Hollywood work that is truly sui generis.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
Missing Opportunities,"As a therapist, I truly appreciate Groundhog Day. The idea of reliving the same day over and over invites deep introspection: if we could replay an event, how would we approach it differently? The film's protagonist starts out frustrated, repeating mistakes, missing opportunities, and even falling into despair. However, through these repeated experiences, he learns valuable lessons. It suggests that perhaps it's not perfection but the errors, the stumbling, and the missed chances that teach us about life's deeper truths. The process of trial, error, and growth ultimately shapes us. It's a poignant reminder that our flaws and setbacks are just as integral to personal growth as our successes. A powerful, insightful film that resonates with the human experience.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"

Well done Phil!,"Phil Connors,a sarcastic weather man disappointed from his boring life the 2nd of February of every year goes to a lost little city in Pennsilvanya to shoot a reportage about an old local tradition ""The Groundhog day"",where a nice big rat,like Phil calls it,seems able to preview the last of the winter and the came of the spring..but this time something of really strange happens,Phil ,for a joke of the destiny (or who knows what else..)is obliged to live the same day for hundred of times ,so every day ,for his desperation,he's woke up at 6:00 am by the same song at the radio and meets always the same people who obviously don't realize what is going on and can't understand his drama. I think this one the best comedy of the 90s not only for the Brilliant performance of Bill Murray (absolutely perfect in this role)but in particular for the deeper meaning of the story. In fact Phil's life is a disaster he's selfish,presumptuous, cinic and only when he changes his nature,stopping to use this absurd situation for his goals ,things will be better for him and the 2nd of February finally will be the 3rd!.So knowing perfectly the things of the day he's forced to live ever he starts helping people : save a child who's falling form a tree,save a man hit by an heart attack and so on in this way he also conquest the woman of his dreams (Andy McDowell).So this film is  a metaphor.Each of us after all live always the same day (wake at the same time,make the same job,see the same people)without realizing it,maybe we should make like Phil and try to change ,even just a bit,to be better person and to feel better ,is it so difficult ?..",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"

While most movies would probably try to use this premise as an excuse for a bunch of silly gags, ""Groundhog Day"" uses it to show how Phil changes: he starts out a sour, cynical jerk, and slowly but surely grows more human as the movie passes. That's not to say that the movie doesn't allow for some goofy scenes. Among other things, Phil memorizes every event that's going to happen every day (""I am God! I know everything that's going to happen!""), and he has a really funny encounter with the groundhog in one scene.

There're so many nuances, and moments that get found and that are anticipated that you laugh the moment before it happens. I marvel at the timing and movement as you are drawn through the growth and changes faced by this unwilling human ( Phil Conners)as he faces life head on.

Great comedy,This is a very unusual modern day comedy because it makes you think. Phil Connors is a weatherman on a regional tv station who thinks he is more important than he really is. He is sent off to do his annual report on groundhog day which is something he hates. What he doesn't know is that he is about to endure the same day over and over again.His mood changes from disbelief to elation that he can do anything he wants with no consequences. Once bored with this his mood darkens to depression and even his suicide attempts fail to get him out of the loop. Is it possible for him to escape ?

"""It's Almost Like Being in Love""","Groundhog Day is one of those rare movies that not only can make you laugh hysterically and cry from one moment to the next, but also only improves with age, with a fantastic script from Ramis and a terrific performance from Murray- you'll rarely see the two work so well together on screen- let alone be able to watch it again and again. I love this movie, and I have since I was little. Many kids were first introduced to Bill Murray in films like Ghostbusters or Caddyshack, or simply just by watching him on SNL. For me, my introduction to Murray was from this film, and personally, it's one of my favorite performances from him. The range he is willing to show with his character on screen is really dumbfounding. There is still the hilarious genius we have come to love, but also such a greater depth to him than we have seen in his other works. Harold Ramis provides the script for the film, a deeply original and unique story, as well as the direction, which is perfect in every sense of the word. I feel the pacing is what makes this film so good, because they easily could have made it a comedy and forgotten all about timing and the drama efforts it involves, but its storytelling is so carefully crafted and well-orchestrated you can't help but feel in awe as it makes you feel so much year after year. It may not be as old as some classics like It's a Wonderful Life or as well recognized as Ghostbusters but Groundhog Day is simply a timeless masterpiece that I hope more generations will find and recognize for years to come.

The movie show one guy's quality really.,"I just think it's not only a funny movie ,but also a special,wonderful one .We should thank Danny Rubin,the story writer ,who created a great script for this movie. Bill Murray did very well . When he knew he could live in this day all the time ,he did something that any guys would do: First,sex ; (very easy) Second,a lot of money; (not hard ) Third,a woman he love (very hard ) so,although he knew a lot of things about ""Rita"" ,but he found that the love of woman is very hard to get .In fact ,he understood something should be changed in himself ,and he should know himself , understand the value of people's life and even the meaning of true love .So, he tried to change himself ,and he did it in the end . From all of comments above ,we even can get a standard way of many guys ,they work very hard ,they earn money for fun or sex ,but they can't get true love of woman he love .It's so sarcastic,isn't it? 'Cause that need a big change in himself ,it's the most hard thing,nobody like change ,it's truth ,but they did it in the end just for true love of the woman. so,I think the movie show one guy's quality really.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
A Dud,"While ""Groundhog Day"" is a film that I've long heard about and heard people reference it took me years to finally sit through the whole thing. After several abortive attempts to do just that I finally got through it and let me tell you it does not get any better. This film is a dull slog the entire way with no likeable characters or uplifting moments, just a repetitive waste really that is often absurdly lauded. The only watchable scene really is the final one where I think he realizes that he should just be happy living in the present.

It was so incredible, everything was perfect and it wavered around so many genres. The obvious side had evaporated from it, but the true inner-self had been unleashed to me. This is probably one of my favourite films because of that.Bill Murray is perfect excellence in his role and his chemistry with Andie McDoawell is lovely. Everyone else in their roles, don't give out outstanding performances, but they generally feel like real-life people that surround you almost un-noticed in your own life.

Okay, maybe that is a message that today's post-modern moviegoers don't want to hear. But some odd coincidences with my own life endowed the movie with an unusual resonance for me personally. For example, I had taken up studying piano and Rachmaninoff's 18th Variation was one of the pieces I aspired to master (q.v. the dance at the end). I also had read many Chekhov works (q.v. Murray quoting Chekhov in one of his broadcasts from Punxsutawney).Bottomline, if you find this movie distasteful, I can only assume that you too are stuck in your own groundhog day.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
Peak Bill Murray,"While I do think many people go overboard with their praise of this movie, Groundhog Day is nevertheless a highly inventive quirky comedy and features one of Bill Murray's best performances. I feel like this could potentially have been a massive flop had anyone other than Murray been cast in the lead role, especially given that his co-star Andie MacDowell is completely devoid of charm in every role she plays. Murray is as dry and biting as ever but still manages to make us fall in love with Phil Connors and feel every inch of his anguish, despair and humility.I do find the underlying premise a bit disconcerting, however. The idea that Connors has to achieve some kind of moral perfection in order to win the heart of a fairly uninteresting woman so that he can be freed from his purgatory is, at best, a little odd and at worst, quite grotesque. I really wish he had broken free from Groundhog Day on his own, with his romantic future still undetermined.Regardless, this is one of those films you just need to watch at least once in your life. A nineties classic, with Bill Murray at his best.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"

But for some strange reason, Phil is suddenly stuck in a time loop and live the same day over and over again, with the same situations and the same encounters. Progressively, the nightmarish feel is replaced by a domestication of this power which Phil uses by making each day the next one's draft, avoiding the same mistakes and blunders, or taking advantages of some situations through stealing, seducing women and being totally irresponsible with no fear of long-term consequences.The movie is a fantasy in the way it fantasizes about the impossibility of giving ourselves eternal second chances, it's the sad basis of our human mortal condition that implies the acceptance of responsibilities and consequences, even of the most futile actions. It's even an evocation of the Schopenhauer's view of world as our own will and representation, which puts us as our own self-referential axis in a universe that can be totally different from another perspective. But interestingly, this power will progressively drives an empathic move in which Phil will help, save people, and learn to dedicate his time for the community, and God knows how much he's got. Punxsutawney is his representation, ordinary peoples' happiness, his eternity.And as there's no better comedy than a comedy with a heart, the heart of the film is in Phil Connor's redemption and use of the gift to make his life better for him, for the others, and for Rita, played by the beautiful Andie McDowell.""Groundhog Day"" is a story with an inspirational message, carried by Bill Murray's virtuoso performance, and providing some of the funniest cinematic running gags ... including one hell of a face punch!AND THANKS FOR READING ...

A disturbingly unforgettable film. A rare gem.,"This is one of the few films that I watch over and over. If Purgatory or Hell exist, this tale has a place in them as a hard scenario.At first it seems a standard comedy but then it quickly darkens to one of the best horror films made. More of the horrible fate of this man unfolds as you pick up the comments and innuendo. Only at the end does the viewer realize that the victim has spent the equivalent of many lifetimes in the one-day loop, with no hope of release, even death is not granted to him.When he is finally released, a rebuilt and different man, I want to cheer.Recommended viewing.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"

The story of how a character gets stuck in a time loop has been make in various other movies and TV shows, but Groundhog Day was the mother of all the other spin offs.It is a great movie with a humorous yet heartwarming story.

A Perfect Anti-Hero,"Groundhog Day displays exactly why Bill Murray is a film legend. His ability to be loved and detested at the same time, makes him the perfect anti-hero.The deep dive into the stages of grief while allowing the audience time to consider how they would act, teaches a valuable lesson on empathy. While the story has a few dull moments (which should be expected due to the concept), Bill's performance and the raw emotion of this film elevates it to become a classic.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"

If you haven't seen, run out and get it! This movie was an early breakout role for Bill Murray, who was under-appreciated at the time as a great actor.There's no gimmick or trick to the movie. You just have to pay close attention and consider how one movie under two hours manages to capture everything from Buddhist enlightenment to dating to the nature of self-hatred, self-love, snobbery, and kindness.

A totally flawless movie,"It's hard not to adore this film. I've seen it so many times I can speak along with the dialogue virtually throughout, but it loses none of its magic. Can there really be anyone left who hasn't heard the premise of this movie? If you are that person, then here it is: grumpy prima donna weatherman (Bill Murray), frustrated by being stuck on local news, is sent with his sexy new producer (Andie MacDowell) and irritating cameraman (Chris Elliot) to the backwater of all backwaters, Punxsatawney, Pennsylvania. Why? Because that's the centre of the Groundhog Day festival where, every February 2nd, America waits to see if there will be six more weeks of winter. Murray is bored and fed up after being sent to cover the story, but his distress only escalates when he realises he is stuck in Groundhog Day every day. No matter what he does, at 6am every morning he is back in his bed listening to Sonny and Cher.This movie, while definitively romantic in places, is always, always imaginative. We follow Murray's character through depression at his time warp existence, joy at the fact he can do anything including steal thousands of dollars, determination when he realises that he can get to know MacDowell's Rita without her sensing his ulterior motives, and desolation again when he understands the meaninglessness of a life devoted to himself.Although that all sounds kind of deep, the film is a total joy from start to finish, and you never realise you're being exposed to hardcore philosophical concepts as you see Murray scoffing cake in a diner. Enough laugh-out-loud moments to make this a comedy classic, Groundhog Day also has thoughtful and intelligent subtexts, which make it worth watching dozens of times.

At first glance, this is just another romantic comedy, that will relax, endear you and make you laugh, but with every new watching, more and more I realize the multilayeredness and depth of its story. ""Groundhog Day"" is a philosophical study of human nature and life, subtly packaged in the form of excellent comedy, with a rarely well-written script, which has picked up a bunch of awards and nominations. It's a shame that it's not even nominated for an Oscar.

"""He's having the day of his life, over and over...""","I walked in. I had minor tad expectations. This was one of very few peoples favorite film, it had some good potential, and it had Bill Murray in it. How could anything go wrong? I sat down, turned it on, and took a swig at enjoying a mind(less) comedy...I liked it. Groundhog Day has lots of heart, lots of laugh, and lots of sarcastic one-liners from Bill Murray. But as all this seems to come and go, there were some issues with it. The characters were really one-dimensional. Murray's character was set-up to be a jerk and learn a life lesson from repeating a bad day over and over again. The set-up was useless, and it was contrived. The movie was funny, but the jokes seemed to borrow and borrow from other films similar. Maybe it was because I've seen other modern tales ripped-off from this movie, that the jokes seemed not too smart, but good nevertheless. The film came off a little forgettable, as it gives a good moral lesson and then goes elsewhere; meaning comedy. Lots of it seemed a little preachy, the kind that tells you to get off your ass and live life, but it really didn't take away that much. And my last complaint was how it lacked depth. It sends a message, gives us a good laugh, then wraps up. The movie never gives us something to REALLY think about. The message could've been sugarcoated with more thought and process, but the final product wasn't as bad as my expectations thought it would be.So the film was good. Although it was somewhat of a forgettable comedy, with a somewhat preachy moral message, it entertains and provides itself as a yearly tradition, and a good one at that.7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
Thought-provoking and hilarious,"If you don't think that Bill Murray is one of the funniest men on the planet, then you clearly haven't seen Groundhog Day. Murray owns the screen from beginning to end of this marvelous film, and I mean he owns it. Obviously the Academy Awards don't actually care about honoring great film, regardless of genre, because this is clearly one of the best films of 1993, the 1990's as a whole, and also of all time.Murray plays Phil Connors, a cynical weatherman sent to cover the Groundhog Day festivities in Punxsatawney, Pennsylvania. His one-day trip turns into a never-ending cycle, as Phil gets caught in a time warp that causes him to relive the same day over and over again. Phil is stuck in Punxsatawney for a seemingly endless amount of time; each day, he wakes up in the same Bed and Breakfast and nobody else remembers a thing about all the days he's lived. We follow Phil through several emotional stages, ranging from confusion to terror to joy to despair and ultimately to real happiness.Groundhog Day is one of the most original comedies I've ever seen. The plot has been repeated on television shows several times since (and perhaps the idea had been filmed beforehand, I'm not sure), but never has it been as perfectly crafted as it is here. Groundhog Day is both funny and realistic, (as realistic as a time-warp movie can be) and Bill Murray is perfect in the lead role. Andie McDowell is also very good as Rita, Phil's co-worker and eventual love interest.Groundhog Day is essentially a comedy, but it is also deeply thought-provoking, and makes you consider how you live your life. Phil starts out as a selfish, cynical man and slowly changes into a considerate, helpful individual who truly cares about others. As we watch him transform into a better person, we laugh a whole lot at the situations he gets into- but we hopefully emerge from it all like him, a changed man for the better. Groundhog Day is a brilliant piece of film-making and should be watched by everybody (preferably every Groundhog Day, which is February 2nd).",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
A unique and inventive comedy,"Now in 2001 I've just seen Groundhog day for the very first time, on DVD. What a refreshing film. It's very funny in it's repetition and utterly true in it's movements.Perhaps what I enjoyed the most about it was the evolution of Phil (Bill Murray) and the realism of his actions. His responses were predictable on a level. I don't mean that as a criticism but as a positive element. While I didn't always  know what was coming next, I certainly understood on an emotional level.Who wouldn't, after realizing they were living the same day over and over, abuse the power of it. Run from the cops, rob a Brinks truck. But as we progressed, we understood why Phil moved from abuse to improvement.A quality film. 7 out of 10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"

Groundhog Day(1993),"The pacing and development just hits the right note every time in a synopsis that on first reading seems to have limited comedic appeal but the cast and direction just win you over.Funny but poignant film. Phil Connors is a weatherman for Channel 9 News Pittsburgh and covers the Groundhog Day festival at the small town of Punxsutawney for several years now. Phil is a cynical and bitter man, dislikes the small town atmosphere, and just wants to get back to Pittsburgh as soon as possible. However, when he discovers that he begins to relive February 2nd everyday over and over he believes he losing hid mind .As such, the minor holiday becomes the single-most worst day of his life and as Connors continues to relive Groundhog Day. To his advantage, he uses it to woo cheerful producer Rita Hanson (MacDowell) into a romantic relationship.Murray's performance doesn't only elevate the film to a completely different level but also elevates the work being put in by the rest of the cast. Intelligent movie. It really lives to its reputation, which is overwhelmingly positive. A lot of substance, all understated, some laughs, respects its audience and delivers a great Romantic comedy.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
"Karma, Comedy, and Eternal Recurrence","Apparently Bill Murray and Harold Ramis fell out over the direction of this film, ending perhaps the most commercially successful working relationship in the history of film comedy (Caddyshack, Stripes, Ghostbusters, etc.). It is hard to understand the dissatisfaction of either with the finished product. The movie is an absolute masterpiece.The writing is brilliant, original and fantastically layered. The story, which details the inner journey of a Pennsylvania weatherman who finds himself living the same day over and over again, is an allegorical representation of spiritual and moral growth that has resonated with people of all religious persuasions. But for those who like their films uncomplicated, unfreighted with symbolic meanings, the movie is enjoyable on any level. There is nothing pretentious about its ambitions.The acting is note-perfect throughout, and Murray's performance is revelatory. He moves effortlessly between slapstick physical comedy, romantic love, and suicidal depression; and any number of emotional states in between. I can't recall a bad performance by Murrray in any movie, but in Groundhog day he hits more high notes than he's ever hit, before or since. It's a shame the Academy has so little respect for comedy, because his performance in this film is better than many an Oscar winner.One of the best films of the 1990s.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
Forever In A Day,"A wonderful, deceptively smooth blend of contemplative metaphysics and laugh-out-loud comedy, ""Groundhog Day"" is a defining film for Bill Murray lovers who admire the actor for his touchy-feely side as well as his deadpan wizardry.Murray is Phil Connors, a Pennsylvania TV weatherman who travels to Punxsutawney to cover the annual Groundhog Day celebration. In just the first minutes, his boredom and misery about his situation quickly becomes a drain on everyone around him.""Some day, somebody's gonna see me interviewing a groundhog and think I don't have a future,"" he quips. This proves to be an unfortunately accurate prediction when Phil wakes up every morning thereafter finding himself in the same place, reliving the same day. No future indeed.It's a perfect Murray comedy in many ways, one being how it hearkens back to past glories. Just like in ""Caddyshack,"" his character appears locked in a struggle with a large rodent. The same wake-up line he hears every morning, ""Rise and shine, campers,"" calls us back to Murray's film debut, ""Meatballs."" But then as the film goes on, you get the depth and tragic sensibilities in tune with later Murray, of quieter art-house comedies like ""Lost In Translation"" and ""The Life Aquatic.""Later Murray is a mixed bag for me, but I enjoy this one a lot. He's so terrific playing Phil at various stages in a long path. It is a path, even if it feels more like a treadmill to Phil: ""I wake up every day, right here. Right in Punxsutawney. And it's always February 2. And there's nothing I can do about it.""The repetitive nature of ""Groundhog Day"" throws not a few viewers, but I enjoy them the same way I do Murray's early work on ""Saturday Night Live."" It's like getting a series of short, black-out sketches, with the added benefit of each building to a larger whole.Director Harold Ramis, no stranger to this approach from his own glory days on ""SCTV,"" frames many of these bits in a clever way. We see Phil go through the same motions again and again, like trying to pick up his luminous producer Rita (Andie MacDowell) by repeating the same basic lines with tiny adjustments to allow for her varied reactions. Repetition becomes the joke, and it's a good joke because it feeds the brilliant try-and-try-again story of life lived in microcosm as written by Danny Rubin and Ramis.What is the film's message? It's not easy to explain. Phil alternately becomes opportunistic, despairing, accepting, and ultimately responsible. You can see it as a spiritually focused but devoutly ecumenical sermon for achieving personal growth. Or, like me, you can see a black comedy of a man's miserable inability to achieve perfection, even when he has an eternity to play with. But maybe that's because I'm a ""glass-half-empty kind of guy,"" as one of Phil's new local friends puts it.The negatives here are minor. As a Chris Elliott fan, I wish more had been done with his cameraman character than a few reaction shrugs. Some of the sillier comedy moments, like Phil dressing up as Clint Eastwood, plays like cutting-room fodder to me, as does an extended, maudlin sequence with a homeless man. At least that part ties into the acceptance idea, which is key to Phil's turnabout late in the film.But taken as a whole, which is the only way to take it, this is a classic comedy, worthy of the love it gets. Why don't the Academy Awards people take these films seriously? I guess it doesn't matter when the results shine through the ensuing years as powerfully as ""Groundhog Day.""",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
Enjoyable,Groundhog day is a great film and another showcasing the talents of Bill Murray. This is Bill Murray's finest performance I have seen to date. He nails his role as the cynical and self-absorbed Phil Connors and he treats everyone badly. He one day wakes up and finds he has to relive the same day over and over. We see a great transformation in Phil and it takes great talent to pull this off.I had seen Scrooged last Christmas which was a spin on A Christmas Carol. I have to say the plot of Groundhog day was quite similar with a different twist. Both involved characters transforming from mean spirited to happy and cheerful except this film was more enjoyable. The supporting cast give some great performances which enhance the quality of the film. Perhaps the film would have been more enjoyable if the day that Phil relived was more eventful or notable. Besides the event of Groundhog day it seemed quite plain and ordinary despite his great performance. We also are unsure why he relived the days and why it suddenly stopped. I have seen a number of lower rated and similar films that have actually explained their fiction or twists to make them more believable. I think the majority of the voters have positive associations with this film perhaps because it was part of their childhood or nostalgia which makes it a great film to them no matter what.Thankfully for the story it ended when he became more humane and pleasant.

An ode to the Groundhog,"Groundhog Day (1993) As Roger Ebert pointed out in his great movie's review of Groundhog Day, it is so good, so entertaining, so fun, that its all too easy to overlook its greatness. I agree.Groundhog Day is nothing less than a classic. It is a once in a lifetime kind of film, one that worked so well in the context of its own time period that its simply impossible to imagine the film having the same impact if it was made either 10 years earlier or ten years later. If that makes any sense. I suspect if you've seen it and loved it (which more often than not is simply the by-product of having seen it) you know what I mean.The premise, of course, Bill Murray plays a smarmy weatherman who is forced to relive groundhog day over and over again until he comes to great realizations about the meaning what it is to live. It's not only a very funny idea, but also a deep one with philosophical and existential undertones. Yes, not only is Groundhog Day a film so enjoyable its underrated, but also underestimated.Bill Murray is one of the funniest men to ever work in cinema, with the ability to express humor without emoting, to express subtle depth, profundity and sadness while slapsticking. Groundhog Day is one of his best outings. It's one of the few films that truly makes me nostalgic for days gone by, but optimistic for the days to come.I realize this review is little more than a puff piece, but why waste precious time on the small trivial faults when the sum of the parts is so wonderful.

A simple tale that conceals surprising depth and meaning,"""Groundhog Day"" is a rare case of audiences actually being ahead of the critics. When this superficially simple tale of a self-obsessed weatherman (Bill Murray) who is forced to relive the same day over and over again was initially released, most critics, even the best, completely missed this movie's subtle and intricate take on the vagaries of life. They followed only its simple premise, slapstick humour and the great, sarcastic shadow of Bill Murray, who, as always, dominates every scene. Audiences, however, immediately took to it. Despite being released (appropriately) in February, the famine period of the movie calendar, ""Groundhog Day"" went on to gross over $70 million and became a sleeper hit later on video. Soon, the phrase ""It's like Groundhog Day"" began passing from mouth to mouth as a descriptor for any number of human situations, and Groundhog Day was better recognised as a metaphor than as a holiday. Today, ""Groundhog Day"" is recognised by the AFI and the Writer's Guild of America.That ""Groundhog Day"" works on all the levels it does is not necessarily due to conscious action on the part of the writers (Harold Ramis and John Rubin), who focus primarily on delivering a sharp and witty script that fully explores every comic (and later, tragic) outcome of its premise, but because its premise, so utterly simple, is also marvelously applicable to an almost endless array of life experiences. In that sense, it is like a fairy tale or a myth: a universal story that manages to capture something essential in the human experience. For example, there is very little overt religious symbolism in the film, and yet representatives of several entirely different religions have drawn parallels between the story and the tenets of their faith. Buddhists see Murray's character's dilemma as a representation of the cycle of rebirth, while Catholics see it as Purgatory. In truth, as the film itself notes, *everyone* feels trapped in an endlessly repeating cycle of identical days for at least part of their lives, and so is free to read it as applies to them.Beyond this though, it really is quite astounding how perfect this little film is; how annoying characters we wouldn't give the time of day to in the street suddenly become fully fleshed out comic creations, simply because we took the time to see them properly. How every bland suburban street reveals turn-of-the-century architectural gems that our eyes would have passed over on first viewing, and how beautiful the sky can look on a cold February morning.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
Absolutely Wonderful!,"This (along with Lost in Translation) is my favorite Bill Murray movie. It has everything needed to make it a classic movie. It has a highly innovative story, excellent acting and something else which cannot be described but you feel it.Bill Murray stars in this film which in essence is a film about a man who relives the same day over and over and over. If you can get past the fact that this is impossible you are in for a hell of a movie treat. As I see it the storyline is perfect for character development and great gags. Without saying too much I can say that the main character, who is the only one who can actually remember the day before, plays on this and seduces women. The writer originally wanted the audience to join the main character as he had already been trapped in this time loop for many years (he doesn't age, how can he when the day before never happened?) and he knows everything about everyone. This approach was thankfully abandoned because watching Bill Murray react to his predicament is nothing short of priceless. He is initially intrigued by the concept and abuses his situation but eventually there is a change in the character. What changes I will leave to future viewers to find out for themselves. The film graces a few philosophical questions but nothing more than that because the objective of the film is entertainment and it succeeds brilliantly in its goals.The cast is stellar. Bill Murray, one of our time's greatest actors both comedy wise and dramatically, does an excellent job. His comic timing is flawless and his underplayed and sometimes quite dark humor works brilliantly on screen. Also he portrays the changes in his character with great skill. Pure movie magic. Andie MacDowell, who in my opinion is a very underrated actress, does a great job as well. She is instantly likable and the audience relates to her character immediately because of this. Her reactions are highly believable and this of course adds to the overall credibility of the film. Chris Elliot gracefully underacts his part which is a good thing because the emphasis is on Murray's character but he serves his purpose to great effect. Stephen Tobolowsky steals every scene he is in and contrary to Chris Elliot he overacts every scene he is in but he stays within the confines of believable so his character too works magnificently and creates a lot of laughs. Other than the actors mentioned the supporting cast is excellent. What few scenes Brian Doyle-Murray, Bill Murray's brother, is in he makes his own.Overall the film's cinematography and sets work pretty well but as the emphasis is on the characters its not really worth mentioning aside from what I've just said. The music is another thing which is very good. The score by George Fenton is excellent and fresh. It doesn't sound like something we've heard before and therefore adds to the originality of the film which is already substantial.The whole concept of the film might sound a bit pretentious but it doesn't feel that way. In fact it feels very down to earth because of the characters' believable reactions and seemingly genuine emotions.All in all an excellent, highly original comedy that is definitely worth a look.9/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
The definition of the successful sureal comedy!,"Immaculate! The direction of this surreal plot is excelent and together with Bill Murray's unprecedented performance, it is undoubtly one of the best comedies. Best pick would be the scene where Bill Murray dives from the bell-tower (campanario/champagnerie) in slow motion wearing pyjamas, rain coat and gloves. His expression together with the Howard Shorish soundtrack manages to capture the apotheosis of utter despair. Must see at least thrice.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
A feelgood 'Minority Report',"Bill Murray is caught in hell, living over and over again the same day in the dull little town of Punxitsyawney (or something like that). That is, it's hell until he realises it can be heaven and, using the knowledge he builds up over the countless repeated days, sets about getting the girl, by relatively fair means when he's always used foul before.The film is packed with wit (Phil: ""Do you ever have dejá vu?"" Landlady: ""I don't know - I'll take a look in the kitchen.""), has Andie MacDowell at her most appealing and Bill Murray in sublime form as the grumpy weatherman who learns humility the hard way.In short - a blast.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
One of the very best,"I watch this film every year, on 2nd February if I remember, in homage to the concept of life repeating itself. Others have paid tribute to the wonderful performances of Bill Murray and Andie MacDowell, but everything that happens is worth watching over and over again. It never becomes stale because there is some basic existential truth in Groundhog Day. It's also a puzzle that is never solved.Recently, I heard on a TV documentary (I can't remember what it was about) that 2nd February is Candlemas, an ancient festival linked to folk tradition as well as a religious festival. Traditionally, on this date, animals which hibernate such as bears and wolves will come out and inspect the weather. If they see fine weather, they anticipate that harsh winter weather will continue for another 40 days, and they return to their hibernation. I feel that the choice of Groundhog Day as the day on which Phil experiences being trapped in the winter world of Punxsatawney is meaningful for this reason as well as what happens to the main character.Overall, it's a very hopeful story, with a wonderful ending, and I will never grow tired of watching it every year.For everyone except Phil, that day is a brand new 24 hours, and everything happens once. Phil experiences the day repeatedly, so he can learn something each time. The others meet him anew, or on Rita's case, have only 1 day to get to know him better. Still, by the end he has learnt how to maximise the impact of his interactions because he only has that day in which to do it. Another thing that occurred to me recently is poignant: his Bed and Breakfast establishment is homely but doesn't have hot showers! The day on which Phil is stuck is one on which he must take a cold shower - every day. That's purgatory, by my reckoning.Update: I watch this film every year on 2nd February, or as close as possible. This year I was impressed again by Bill Murray's wonderful performance, the cheerfulness of all the characters and the life-affirming message of the film. I was also surprised when I awoke on 3rd February to see that it had snowed overnight (in London, UK), and therefore I think the weather was telling me that it was indeed the day after Groundhog Day!",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
My 25th Review: This movie is a comedy that should go down with Bill Murrays best.,"Now I am a big fan of Bill Murray and I loved movies with him in it like The Man Who Knew too Little and Caddyshack. The movie is about a stuck up news reporter who finds himself in his home town reliving Groundhog Day over and over again. This movie is good because it is clever, original and funny or hilarious as I should say. This Bill Murray movie is probably my equal favourite one with him in it to The Man Who Knew too Little. Overall I rate this movie very high for cleverness and all that while being one of the funniest Bill Murray movies out there so I recommend this to anyone and everyone as it is enjoyable and should be(and probably by now is) a major classic so 97%.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
More than a movie. A philosophy lesson,"So incredible... and so incredibly underappreciated. Yes, it's funny and witty, but the depth of Groundhog Day is so much more. It's an evolutionary tale, a philosophy lesson wrapped up as a comedy and delivered with a big red bow.Look past the absurd premise and the dozens of funny scenes and memorable lines, and you'll find a deeper message... you're handed eternity and what do you do with it? Phil Connors, after the initial freak-out, uses his newfound eternal status to get with women, steal money, and have fun. As he evolves as a human being stuck in time, he turns his eyes toward helping others, growing as a person, and sincerely finding love. Only then is the spell broken, and the calendar turns to Feb 3rd. It is heartwarming and brilliant and more than a comedic masterpiece. It is a life lesson and if you didn't appreciate it, you need to watch it over and over again until you do. An exceptional film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
"My absolute favorite movie, pure philosophy","Groundhog Day is definitively the best movie ever made. Besides it is the most underrated movie ever made. In the beginning the story seems to be strange, but then you recognize more and more that this movie is pure philosophy, pure wisdom. The director must be an Illuminated or something like this. If you have a bad day, all you have to do, is to think on this movie and things will change. The actors, Bill Murray and Andie Mac Dowell, are absolutely marvelous. The scene, where Bill as Phil tells Andie as Rita how wonderful she is, is indescribable, although I know it only with german synchronsation. Well, you MUST see this movie, there is no way. Allthough I know people, who don't like it. But these poor (kind of) human beings definitively are lost.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
Optimism,"The cast in this film is perfect but the story makes the film. Is it about optimism? The affectionate tension builds, beginning low-key and subtly, between the cynicism and pessimism of Bill Murray's weatherman, Phil, and the tolerant accommodation of his producer, Rita(Andie McDowell), not to mention the general good-cheer of the townsfolk.But does Phil have to become an optimist to win Rita's heart?Or is there something else going on here?Is it even about learning how to do a myriad of things, just in order to impress the girl?Phil is definitely your true-to-life cynic.But what it is that finally changes Phil, in the end?The focus narrows as he refines his technique, his approach, his way of thinking.What finally is it, that changes Phil?And what finally enables Phil, and Rita, to make it through to the next day, breaking the spell?It isn't because they were able to stay up all night, through to 6 a.m.Because it shows they were clearly asleep when the clock announces a new day.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
My favorite comedy!,"Bill Murray in a tour de force performance as the cocky weather man Phil, who gets to learn a thing or two about humility. Phil is initially a rather tragic man, lonesome and unhappy with his life, which shows in his satiric and disrespectful attitude towards people. This is also the case with his work, for instance when he must cover the festivities around the groundhog day in the small town Punxsutawney. But fate has had enough, and an unexpected snow blizzard forces Phil and his camerateam to stay one more night in town. The next day, Phil experiences deja vu: he's stuck in yesterday! From now on, he goes through a series of transformations, ranging from bliss, to megalomania, to utter despair, to resignation, and finally: empathy.Bill Murray's contribution to this movie is immense. His mimic and body language alone is enough to make you laugh, and a wonderful script is the icing on the cake. Groundhog Day is a movie with a lot of heart and a great atmosphere, and it offers many laughs as well. I must have seen it about ten times by now, and I'd rank it as my favorite comedy.Rating: 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"

A brilliant idea for a movie - executed very well,"Phil is a bitter, egocentric weatherman who treats his co-workers and the public in general with sarcastic contempt. He joylessly travels to the remote town of Punxsutawney to carry out an annual assignment that he particularly dislikes - the Groundhog Day. While here, he inexplicably he wakes every morning thereafter to live the same day over and over again but with the freewill to act it out newly as he sees fit. In reliving the same day he moves from exploiting his unique position in order to use people to his advantage and onto a position where he begins to care more about these people and acts like a less self-centred individual.Groundhog Day is pretty clearly a high concept movie, i.e. A film whose premise you could describe in one sentence. Consequently, high concept movies don't tend to have the best of reputations as great cinema. But, it has to be said, that Groundhog Day is a very good example of a film that makes the most of a very straightforward premise. The format is deceptively simple but it allows for a lot of scope for lots of comedy as well as some well observed pathos. Such a simple idea but such a brilliant one. But what makes it hit an even higher level is the performance of Bill Murray in the central role. This is essentially a vehicle for his brand of acerbic comedy and its hard thinking of anyone else playing his part, he is so well suited to it and so effortless at playing it. It's certainly rare for a film to remain so funny after a couple of decades and the best bits of this one are still highly amusing but it also has a good deal of wisdom too. It maybe sometimes overplays the sentimentality in its final third but it can be forgiven for this on account of the many things it gets right elsewhere.Phil is a bitter, egocentric weatherman who treats his co-workers and the public in general with sarcastic contempt.

Another Groundhog Day,"I will not waste your time w/ boring details of funny and knee slapping events of Groundhog Day. The fact stands that Bill Murray is one of the greatest comedic geniuses of his time. I cannot explain the grace and charm Bill releases into the texture of the movie. It is hard to fathom another actor who audiences have the patience to sit through and watch a man, over and over again, fail miserably at winning the girl's heart. Phil's transformation from a demon to a saint is well accommodated by Bill Murray's physical versatility. He can portray a ""glass half empty"" character and still be left with grace, or he can bring out a believable kindhearted soul that audiences follow with admiration. It is my opinion that Harold Ramis did not directly create the character, but let Bill Murray manifesting himself into the character of Phil Conners. I know very little about Harold Ramis' creative techniques, but I do know that he is a great man for making the executive decision to place his old friend Bill Murray into this role. I am speaking out of my rear end and this is just my opinion, so if there is any discrepancies do not write a counter comment please. Bottom line: Led by Harold Ramis, Bill Murray needs to team up with Andie Mac Dowell once again and create ""Another Groundhog Day"".",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"

Can be understood without knowing much background info on the holiday; but such info makes for a richer movie-watching experience.,"Groundhog Day is a holiday with deep roots in the pagan past. It is our only holiday whose theme is weather. It occurs at a time of year when weather occupies our thoughts more thoroughly than at any other time of the year. We know we're still stuck in winter, but enough of the winter has elapsed that we now feel justified in looking ahead to the promise of the spring equinox.More than any other holiday, Groundhog Day is the ""looking-ahead"" holiday. We're not so much celebrating the present on February 2 as we are a day in the not-too-distant future, the spring equinox (a very important time in the lives of ancient peoples). The spring equinox is simply being celebrated ahead of time, as Groundhog Day, on February 2. Asking us to bottle up our hopes until three weeks in March have passed would be be just plain unreasonable, right? This analysis helps explain all the talk of ""forecasting"" on Groundhog Day. But it isn't the Groundhog who's looking ahead, it is we. And whether it arrives early, late or on-time, this is one prediction that inevitably will prove true: spring will arrive, one way or another -- it always has. And on Groundhog Day we take solace in that fact.As I imply in my article, ""Groundhog Day and the Groundhog Day Movie"" the latter can be fully understood only in this context. Like the holiday itself, the ""Groundhog Day"" movie is all about transition. Sure, you can discern the transition without knowing much background at all about the holiday; but such knowledge improves the experience of watching the movie.Then again, ""Groundhog Day"" can be appreciated on many levels. Superficially, it can be enjoyed as a romantic comedy; Bill Murray makes it work on this level. But for those with a philosophical bent, it is a very profound movie. Some have even suggested a connection with Nietzsche's teaching of the Eternal Recurrence.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
Two cents,"I agree with those posters who say this is a terrific and underrated movie. One measure of its quality is the fact that people all over the world are still writing long, heartfelt reviews/analyses of the thing almost a decade after its release. At least a few TV programmers must share this fondness for the movie, as it reappears fairly regularly on the tube -- often, I notice, around New Year's Day (not Groundhog Day, oddly), probably because that's the day (other than our birthdays) when we most often reflect on something as abstract as the passage of time. Like an earlier poster, I think it's interesting that we haven't heard a thing from Danny Rubin since he wrote this movie.  Perhaps that was a nom de plume? For who(m)? one wonders. In a way it's sort of attractive to think of this guy suddenly appearing one day in Hollywood with this wonderful, understatedly profound script, handing it to Harold Ramis or whomever, then vanishing, never to be heard from again.  Maybe he realized he wasn't likely to surpass himself. You wonder if he's even a professional writer. He could be a...weatherman, for all we know. Surely somebody somewhere knows what this fellow is doing now, but I kind of want it to remain a mystery. Not that I can improve upon the outpouring of commentary seen already, but I'll mention the movie's suggestion (an assertion, really, though understated) that, had we but world enough and time, we all should inevitably become saints, simply because to follow any other path in life would be boring and pointless. I think it's in the simplicity and certitude of this message that Groundhog Day differs from almost every other movie, even those movies called ""uplifting."" In Hollywood plots, after all, Good most always triumphs over Evil. But this story seems to imply that the contest between Good and Evil is an illusion: there is no real choice, we can choose to do good now or do good later, but choose it we inevitably must. What a revolutionary statement about life! One isn't very often tempted to use the word ""Tolstoyan"" to describe creative works of any age, let alone movies from Hollywood in the late 20th Century. Yet there it is: a story that could be said to stand on its head much of Western civilization's ethical and theological teaching, all presented via perfectly timed gags, a beautiful girl, and Bill Murray.

Fun fantasy comedy with a few surprises.,"Since the release of 'Groundhog Day' there's been several films with a similar premise, but non as effective, I believe, as 'Groundhog Day'.Have you ever looked back on a situation wishing you could have done it better? 'Groundhog Day' explores this. Egotistical weather man Phil (Bill Murray) travels to the town of Punxsutawney for his annual coverage of Groundhog Day festivities. He covers the event with very little enthusiasm. Along with him, is his cameraman Larry (Chris Elliott) and his new producer Rita (Andie MacDowell).Without any explanation, Phil then finds himself in a loop, where he relives the same day over and over again. I suppose its not important how and why it is happening (to him). The film is a presentation of a 'what if' scenario. If only we could...Bill Murray is perfectly cast as Phil. With every passing day, Phil now knows exactly what will happen next, and is able to prevent or remedy situations. This was both funny and engaging. 'Groundhog Day' is also a very well made love story. I mean, this was actually truly romantic. I loved the way the romance interest started as a platonic working relationship and then slowly developed into much more with every passing day. The film also surprised me by having very touching moments, as well.'Groundhog Day' is entertaining, and I absolutely loved it. The narration and its presentation is wonderful.

Perhaps sometime during the shooting, the director or somebody else may have suspected that it was more than so but much more than a suspicion it was apparently not.It is funny to be sure but below all fun there lies something deadly serious that was not intended but that nevertheless pulls through and leaves the spectator with a sense of awe for every day of life we are given on earth.You could simply state that it is about the limitless possibilities in the single moment or the eternity in a single day and that, if we were allowed to live fully and not as slaves to a murderous few, then a life-span of only 70 or 60 years or even less would be fully sufficient to complete our time on earth. The former thought is more likely religious and the latter more likely revolutionary but they are both possible to be induced when seeing this masterpiece of a film, that was never intended or expected to become just that.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
Deja Vu?  Didn't you just say that?,"This romcom is a very original and imaginative piece of work. It is an excruciatingly tense viewing in which Bill Murray is stuck in the same day (Groundhog Day), and is reliving it over and over and over. The performances are good, and the fact Bill manipulates his producer to fall in love with him by acting in a way which would please her, after secretly finding out her preferences and charms from a previous Groundhog Day. Confused yet?If not you should be, the film is very confusing, and after a bit you think the day will never end, it is an astounding culmination of hilarious comedy, touching romance and outstanding acting that hits you with great effect.Its got action, romance, comedy and drama its funny, yet can still be saddening, so many emotions packed into one film make this a classic.

A uniquely funny fantasy/comedy,"Harold Ramis' Groundhog's Day is not only one of his best, but also a highlight for the star Bill Murray.  The story follows a self-centered weatherman (Murray) who realizes that one day on Groundhog's Day, he has his day repeating over and over again.  A film full of laughs to the brim, even if it's sometimes light, but it is pulled through by comic veterans Murray (who gives one of his best performances) and Ramis who follows with his tradition (Animal House, Vacation, National Lampoon, SCTV, Ghostbusters, Caddyshack and Analyze This) of great comedy films.

Groundhog Day is one of those films you either love or hate.,"No in between, no take it or leave it. Everyone has an opinion, and surprisingly they all appear to be valid. I fall on the ""love it"" side of the equation, but I am a huge Bill Murray fan. Everyone knows a Bill Murray, the guy who wants to do something just wrong enough to get him fired and just right enough to be fun. Bill's character in this film is at the stage in his life where he is totally focused on advancing his career, regardless of what happens to those around him, which is why he cannot advance his career. Chris Elliot as Larry the cameraman is resolved to his role in life, observing the lives of others and getting his paycheck at the end of the day. Maybe Chris wanted to try a straight role for once, maybe there was only room for one comedian in the film, but Chris actually contributes little to the film. Andie MacDowell is the naive, wide eyed beginning producer who really doesn't care about her job as much as she cares about her own agenda. Only in her case, she isn't willing to step over or on people to get where she needs to be in life. Personally I like this film because it is an exhaustive study on the transition of a man through circumstance from an ass to a man. Rated PG for a couple of sexual situations and some violence, I'd say the teens would not be offended, but I doubt they will get it. Collectible if you like Murray, or just like an interesting play on Karma.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
"Seriously, how long did he spend there?","'GROUNDHOG DAY'Directed by Harold RamisStarring Bill Murray and Andie MacDowell.Plot Overview: ​Phil (Bill Murray), a weatherman, is out to cover the annual emergence of the groundhog from its hole. He gets caught in a blizzard that he didn't predict and finds himself trapped in a time warp. He is doomed to relive the same day over and over again until he gets it right.The one thing I knew about this film going into it was the premise. I knew nothing else about it - who the starred in it, who directed it, the names of characters; nothing. Thanks to this lack of knowledge, I thankfully had no expectations either way towards the film. I think that worked towards the film's favour. Let me say this, I do recommend this movie and like it quite a bit but I think I would have been extremely disappointed if I had even the slightest expectations. So if you haven't seen the film, I recommend it just don't go in expecting greatness or mediocrity.Movies like this are, to me, concept movies. They thrive of their unique and interesting concept or gimmick and then use that as a crutch. That is why the concept for this movie is a great one and the reason it has inspired works such as All You Need Is Kill(Edge of Tomorrow). The story surrounding this idea is also pretty decent. We follow our protagonist through possibly decades worth of the same day, with a new focus every once and a while. We see him utilise this gift/curse to learn new skills and try to perfect the day. This is the most interesting part of the film for me. The concept of achieving a perfect day. Reliving a day over and over and over again for eternity until you complete it with no error or flaw is fascinating.Bill Murray is great as Phil and succeeds spectacularly at showing the growth of his character. Andie MacDowel was pretty weak as Rita for me and I didn't buy anything she did or said. I did, however, buy into the romance between the two slowly building over the course of a possibly decade. Even if it did feel slightly manipulative, I did definitely see the connection building over the course of the the film.The cinematography and editing for the film is perfectly passable and looks fine.The movie was pretty funny and it's on the upper half of comedies that I've seen. The dramatic moments also work pretty well and are effectively utilised for full emotional impact. If I had one main flaw with the film, it is the very boring and uninteresting first 20 minutes. I'll make an estimate and say the film begins to get good around the point he sees the benefits of this gift/curse.Honestly, I will recommend you see this movie just don't expect the second coming of Christ. I'll rate this film 7 Perfect Days out of 10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"

Ever wish you could relive the best day of your life over and over again?,"I didn't really know what to expect out of Groundhog Day, to be honest I'm not really a Bill Murray fan. Him carrying a film is not too promising to me, but I'm starting to doubt that since I've been enjoying his films more and more lately. Groundhog Day is brought up in my film books and my mom said that it was a very cute movie that I might wanna check out. When I saw the excellent rating on IMDb, I got even more excited. So I figured I would rent it and give it a shot, though I got a little scared when I read what the plot was about, it seemed a little silly, but when I watched this film this morning, it surprisingly worked!Phil is a weatherman who is sent to Pennsylvania to cover the story for groundhog day with a beautiful woman, Rita who he's had a crush on for a long time. But he's always been too cocky and self centered in her opinion. When the groundhog's shadow shows, there are going to be six more weeks of winter and Phil then experiences something strange. He is reliving February 2 over and over again, but he can remember what happened the day before, so he uses it to his advantage at first. But he starts to realize maybe he could do some good in the world before worrying about getting Rita.Groundhog Day is one of those films that is very charming and the story is really cute. I loved Phil's character, how he changed and transformed himself throughout the film. He went from being a conceited jerk to a lovable guy that wins the audience. It's cheesy, I know, but it's always a plot that wins my heart. The ending was perfect, this movie was just a lot of fun to watch and I would highly recommend it.8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
This Movie Is Funny Over and Over Again,"When you ask someone to think of a Bill Murray movie, Groundhog Day is usually the answer they give. The other half will say Ghostbusters. This is the kind of a role that one is born to play. Murray plays the character of Phil Conners and does it better than a real Phil Conners would have. His comedic talents are highly honed in this performance and he is working near the top of his game. It is so important to be inside a Phil Conner's head in this movie due to the repetitive nature of the movie. Murray is consistent, funny and just melds with the story line.The story line is pretty basic. Phil Conners is a weatherman on assignment to cover Groundhog Day. He doesn't seem to be a nice man nor does he like his job very much. He mis-predicts the weather and end up getting stuck in Puncsutawney, PA where an annual Groundhog Day event is held putting the whole town on hold. Upon awakening the next morning in Puncsutawney the following day he discovers that it is Groundhog Day all over again. There is a great scene when Murray dresses as a cowboy with a date that is classic; and the way he is able to handle the Brink's guards is also very humorous.Also fun to watch in the movie is the talented Andie MacDowell whose character of Rita is completely unaware that it is the same day for Phil. She tries to understand. Less understanding is Phil's cameraman played by David Letterman funny man Chris Elliot who gives his usual spot on dufus performance. The man who will always be synonymous with the film is Stephen Tobolowsky who plays the knee-slapping funny Ned Ryerson. The scenes, few as they are, with Bill Murray are comedy at its finest and also very Bill Murray.Written by Danny Rubin and directed by Harold Ramis (Murray's co-star in Ghostbusters), this film was almost an experiment to see if Hollywood would let them make a movie in which the characters relive the same day over and over again. There have even been analysis papers written about time travel and how Phill Conners reacts in his environment so as to allow the same actions to take place again the next day. The film really found a cult like following when the replay rights were purchased by Turner Broadcasting and the movie received so much repeat airplay on TBS that some viewers thought they were in the actual movie. Ramis is to be commended for keeping all the scenes and continuity straight even with so many Hollywood tricks he could have chosen to use. This movie has turned out to be an important film of the 1990s. 8/10** The poster for the film is a little too cutesy and I never thought of this film as cutesy or talking down to the audience. Of course what does it is the addition of MacDowell on the poster. It must have been in her contract.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
How do you spend your eternity?,"A philosophical parable, a sarcastic metaphor, or just a sheer superb Hollywood-molded comedy, are the titles marked by different spectators. No body however can deny its greatness, although it did not win any award -even in the Oscar (may be nominated in that year as I remembered).Groundhog Day tells us quite an ordinary story: a cynical weather reporter has to repeat the same day Feb 2 in a little town he hates most, so he becomes a god, becomes immortal and wildered by this eternal and miserable day- and finally a traditional but never cheesy happy-end. What makes this movie far beyond a comedic clich¨¦? In my point of view, it is the outstanding theme that uplifts this movie. This hilarious movie has a serious and profound theme which bases on Dostoevsky's query If God had died, could we do anything as we like? or the equivalent, Pascals famous saying Without a God, humans degradation turns meaningless.Fantastically and dramatically, this poor reporter Phil Connors (Bill Murray) acquires a privilege (or a damn) to repeat the same day. That means everything he does in this day will have no consequences. When he wakes up in tomorrow morning, all the things happened in yesterday become a dream. Then he has to live through today repeatedly. Therefore, with this exciting privilege, Phil naturally begins to carry out all the actions he wants to do but dare not to do: to beat an annoying man, to gluttonize desserts without fearing heart diseases, to break laws and rile policemen, to steal money and luxuriously live for one day, to coax a lady into one night stand, to chase his female colleague Rita (Andie McDowell). However, before long, he gradually finds all these mischievous or wicked deeds to be insignificant and temporary, hence a mood of tiredness and despair fills Phils mind so that he decides to end his one-day-life. But, ending this nightmare seems not to be easier than behaving badly. He tries everything. He has been stabbed, shot, poisoned, frozen, hanged, electrocuted and burned. Nevertheless, the next day is still the same Groundhog Day.In this endless torment, Phil becomes to understand that under that circumstance, fame, vanity, lust, money, happiness, sorrow, even life all really turn ephemeral- lasting only one day long- except his mind and thought. To make his transient and eternal life more meaningful, Phil resorts to some grand things- doing good deeds to others. Henceforward, he begins to observe all the people in need, and help them out of trouble in the future. He catches a boy falling down off a tree in an exact time, helps two old ladies repair their car, saves an old man from being chocked¡­ He reads all kinds of books and learns to play piano in order to spend his eternity. Time goes on and on, everyday he repeats these routines cordially and tirelessly until the miracle happens- he finally makes Groundhog Day an end with embracing his love around arms. Phil Connors transcends, not only this torment, but also his past. That line he says is quite impressive: Today is tomorrow. Actually, almost every ordinary man has ever complained that he has to repeat routines and live through a watery everyday life, but not every one has ever tried to put his soul on it, and reap the fruit of the fair life. With the envy of Phils fabulous story, I cannot help asking myself: If I happen to have this trial, how will I spend my eternity? Moreover, this movie affirms an assertion of mine: A mediocre comedy makes you laugh and forget the sadness temporarily whereas an excellent one makes you laugh and confront the ruthless reality intrepidly.Feeling tired of my didactic analysis? Do not be scared. In fact, this Groundhog Day can be everything but a stern sermon. Except for the theme, the nearly perfect performance of actors (esp. Bill Murray), the elaborate and thought-provoking lines, the adept film editing of the director, all make this movie almost flawless. The shortcomings, if there are any, lie in¡­ well, I have tried to point out some, but I fail, because none of them is conspicuous and impeachable.In a word, never miss this Groundhog Day; it will not disappoint you.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
Groundhog Day — A deceptively sweet comedy packed with details and some romance,"Groundhog Day is one of my very favorite movie. I watch it on a regular basis because it is packed with details. It's easy to appreciate right away, but its richness takes a while to seep into you because of the subtle way it's presented to you. Only a year ago I finally understood the depth of the evolution of the main character.It's funny, the laughs are numerous and the humor contagious. The romance is key, but almost secondary. The cameraman and the insurance salesman are the only characters that really tick me off, but they still fit well within the whole movie and do not detract you from appreciating this little marvel.The dialogs, which are Bill Murray's strong suite, are excellent.

"Funny, deeply moving and original!","I wonder what Bill Murray made of this script when it landed on his doorstep. Surely it was going to be a winner as the Murray/Ramis partnership had been one that had bared fruit on a number of occasions already with titles such as Caddyshack, stripes and Ghostbusters all lodged firmly in the minds of movie goers as classic Murray fests. However, I sincerely doubt that he could have ever envisioned the success and popularity that this tale of a local weatherman reliving the same day over and over would go on to achieve at the box office and with fans alike. Murray is the best in the business at world weary cynicism and Phil Connors trial by time is at heart a simple story of a man forced to realise that in a place where nothing changes but himself that this is the only difference that truly matters. The Director Ramis claims to have received letters from people of all religions who have seen this movie and understand the message as one of their own following. In essence this is much more than a simple comedy and as Connors himself reminds us not to underestimate the significance of Groundhog Day.However I would never like to deter anyone from seeing this film on the basis that it may be too convoluted in its message. Every scene is packed with hilarious antics and typically astute Murray one liners. The film is brilliantly cast and Andie Macdowells's innocence and integrity provide a useful contrast to Murray's downbeat yet brilliant humour. She represents the ultimate female companion for Connors and gives the film its real heart as she is the person to which he attains to. There's something quite tragic about reaching out to someone and never being able to have that affection returned. The idea of human loneliness was dealt with great elegance in arguably Murray's finest work 'Lost in Translation' but the comic element of Groundhog Day does not detract from the similar pathos we feel for his isolation in a world where he can touch but never change.This movie has something for everyone. If you're after a deep message, a great love story or are just looking to laugh your ass off then this will be a winner on all fronts.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"

funny and thought-provoking,"In films, we often see people who for one reason or another have to live their lives over, or some segment of it.In Groundhog Day, Bill Murray, who plays weatherman Phil, has to live over Groundhog Day in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania. He doesn't want to go in the first place -- it's his fourth boring trip -- but he does.Because of an impending blizzard, they get stuck there. But Phil gets really stuck. He finds he can't leave the day, the town, or the people.Every day at the same time, his alarm radio turns on and plays ""I Got You Babe"" by Sonny and Cher. And it's Groundhog Day.At first Phil is furious and takes it out on his broadcast about the ceremony, angering his associates (Andie McDowell and Chris Elliot) who didn't like him much to begin with. As the day continues to repeat itself, Phil finds different ways to deal with it.He picks up a woman, proposes to her so he can have sex with her, knowing that the next day the whole experience will be wiped out for her. He sees an old friend, an insurance man, puts up with him for so long, and then punches him.Finally Phil figures out how to cope with the day, which he's resigned to re-live for the rest of his life.Very funny film with Bill Murray in top form as Phil. Murray underplays the role, which somehow makes his lines funnier, dripping as they often are with sarcasm. He's very funny, and funniest when he's pretending to be sincere.The best thing about Groundhog Day is that, like City Slickers, underneath the humor, it's quite serious. It's about how we choose to deal with the situation that we're in, what we would do if we could do a part of our life over, discovering who we are, and letting go of preconceived notions.The film reminded me of something a teacher once said. If you were in an airport and there was an announcement that you would never be able to leave, every need would be met, but you would stay in the airport forever, what would happen?The teacher pointed out that initially everybody would be trying to figure a way out. It's only when you realize that there is no way out that there would be an opportunity for something wonderful to develop in that place, among those people.Groundhog Day is a wonderful film, beautifully directed by Harold Ramis, who co-wrote the screenplay with Danny Rubin, that delivers a great message using humor.

Reliving Deja Vu All Over Again,"""Phil Connors"" (Bill Murray) is a television weatherman for WPBH in Pittsburgh who has an elevated opinion of himself and looks down at everyone else. Although he isn't looking forward to it he has been tasked to go to the small Pennsylvanian town of Punxsutawney to cover the annual event where a groundhog named ""Punxsutawney Phil"" (a groundhog actually named ""Scooter"") is brought out to supposedly predict whether there will be an early spring or a late winter. So after giving the afternoon forecast in which he predicts that a snowstorm will not hit the area, he leaves for Punxsutawney with his new producer ""Rita Hanson"" (Andie MacDowell) and his cameraman ""Larry"" (Chris Elliott). Naturally, being the disagreeable person that he is, it is arraigned for Phil to stay at a local bed & breakfast rather than the hotel which Rita and Larry have chosen to stay. The next morning-on Groundhog Day-Phil does his usual broadcast and eventually retires for the day. However, when he wakes up a 6:00 A.M. the next morning it's Groundhog Day once again--and everything is exactly the same. Needless to say, this disturbs him very much and after going through the motions one more time again retires for the day-only to find that when he wakes up--its Groundhog Day once again. It's then that he discovers that he has been trapped inside a time loop and there is nothing he can do to escape. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this was a fascinating comedy which--ironically enough--never seems to get old. I especially liked the performances of both Bill Murray and Andie MacDowell who seemed tailor-made for their parts. Likewise, the scenes in which Phil attempts to seduce ""Nancy Taylor"" (Marita Geraghty) was also quite amusing as well. In any case, I found this to be a most enjoyable comedy and I have rated it accordingly.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
It's Ground Hog Day -Again Campers- & We Got Ya Babe,"Harold Ramis is a genius in how he developed this comedy in and outside the box frame work which works it's way back to a happy ending. While the plot itself has to do with being stuck in time, place, & space, the development of the characters & the comic situations are classic.This film is one I usually watch every year about Groud Hog Day, & every time I watch it, I notice a subtle piece of humor I didn't notice before. This is the mark of a great film & this is one.The only way you can't like this film is if you don't like Bill Murray. If you don't, & can put that aside, you will still see the genius of the script. I think this one is without a doubt the best performance of Bill Murray's career & the film he will be remembered for. Bill becomes Phil Conner in this film.As the film develops, Phil is not only stuck in this day, but he keeps exploring himself in more & more ways, & gets a chance to get to know the entire world of Pauxatawny, PA intimately. In a way, the predictable happy ending makes sense, as it takes Phil along long time to figure out how to achieve his dream which takes on the human form of Rita.There are some minor problems in the fact that some of the characters almost seem to realize towards the end that Phil has been hanging around town too long. Ramis genius is the themes he packs in. He does the easy ones like suicide & scoring the quickie. Then he does the more subtle ones like ""no consequences"" & playing in the snow. The touch with the bum who time has come no matter what Phil does for him each day shows an interesting depth provocation for a comedy film.The real classic Americana is the choice of Sonny & Cher's ""I Got You Babe"" to wake up to every morning. In a way, Harold Ramis got all of us with this film.""Wake up campers & put on your booties because it's cold outside."" Every day is the same, or is it?

"If at first you don't succeed... try, try, again!","There's an old Doors song that has the chorus line ""break on through to the other side"", and it comes to mind as I write. There are many movies now that begin by showing us an everyday, mundane, version of our world and then have the central character ""breaking through"" to something much more meaningful and significant.Probably The Matrix (1999) is the best example of such a movie, where a computer message implores Neo to ""Wake Up!"" and begin a journey that has him uncovering an alternate reality. And then there is The Truman Show (1998), where Truman (True Man) Burbank begins to suspect that his routine everyday existence in the town of Seahaven has another side to it. Even Star Wars (1977) has a dual reality theme, with a deeper reality being evident in scenes with The Force; the light sabre scenes with Darth Vader, in particular, are fights between spiritual warriors, not ordinary beings.And then we come to Groundhog Day where a nice cosy small town visit leads Phil Connors (Bill Murray) to move beyond the selfishness that has trapped him, towards being a more expansive and loving human being. He realises his limits and becomes a better person. This implies that our lives have a higher purpose and the movie is elevated from simply being a small town comedy.Groundhog Day is yet another example of a movie that can be enjoyed at two levels: as an entertaining and popular box office hit as well as a thought-provoking movie that raises questions about life, the universe and everything. What could have been an ordinary comedy is lifted up by an intelligent script as well as good acting and directing.

A very good comedy starring Bill Murray.,"This is a very good comedy starring Bill Murray, where he plays a weatherman reliving his same day over and over again. The plot is intriguing, cleverly directed to mix in the the right amount of comedy and drama to deliver a very suspenseful and fast-paced movie - nothing slapstick or over-the-top.We get to see Murray's character become frustrated again and again with his reoccurring days, and see him slowly attempt to transform his personality for better or for worse from all the second chances he has been given in each new day. We kind of relate to the problems he has been experiencing, from jobs to relationships. It's exciting to see how Murray will try get himself out of this repeated day predicament.

This makes my heart... warm?,"I've previously watched many ""Groundhog Day"" movies like ; Edge of Tomorrow, Happy death day and Happy death day 2u, 1000 Congratulations (Egyptian movie), and Ghosts of War.

I don't know how but it just works, and I'm really glad it does.

It was beautiful how I was indulged into it like I was seeing it from Phil's point of view? It was good, It was perfect. I thought the point they wanted to make in the movie was gonna be forced, but I really got it. I do get it and I smiled through the whole final 20 minutes of this.

Although maybe not in the same sense as in the movie...The acting is very good from all and Bill Murray has great chemistry with Andie Macdowell. Murray's great way of line delivery makes moments that probably aren't even intended to be funny funny.The message in the film is quite deep and is very relatable, it is more than just a great comedy, it is a great film all around.8.7/10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
Bill Murray shines as never before..,"The humor, the story and the groundhog-element - that's what makes this movies one of the top comedies of the 90s. Bill Murray is simply extraordinary in this role and his role is portrayed quite similar to himself - which probably just has to do with his acting skills. A really entertaining and funny film is what this is. The guy gets the girl and they live happily ever after.. in Punxsatawney (yea try and spell that). It still stays below ""The life of Brian"", but it's still very great! Seee it if you haven't!",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"

It was the end of a VERY long day.,Do not know how I could describe a 90s classic better than to just refer to this movie. Murray and Macdowell are a perfect combo. What would you do if you kept reliving the same day over and over?,8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
A perfect metaphor told just right,"Many refer to this film as a unique metaphor and a sort of balance in the universe.Philosophy aside, the masterful story shape is met with actors, and production at the height of their craft. Bill Murray, Andie McDowell...and Harold Ramis- and an overgrown rat telling the weather.This is one of several films from the 1990s that counterbalanced the cynicism of that decade with a reminder that there were some important things in life and that we need to review our priorities.For me this is a classic film, especially for the holidays, which balanced drama and comedy and yes even some practical philosophy and made for a perfect story. As polished as clockwork, a film with a heart that speaks across the generations.And it's great fun and you even feel good at the end of it while at the same time gives you pause for thought.Not to be missed.

"""I'm A God""","Groundhog Day has taken on a life way beyond its 90s comedy status. The day itself before, was known only in America as being synonymous with the weather. That completely changed when the late Harold Ramis wrote this Bill Murray vehicle. Now it's a worldwide pop-reference for repetition. So simple, utterly fantastic, absolutely hilarious and much more than just an endless loop. Has Bill Murray ever starred in a bad film? Probably, but I don't think I've seen it. Murray you always feel is playing his characters with a good dash of himself included. Bill doesn't give does he and neither does is character here, whether it's nasty Bill at the start or the reborn nice Bill at the end, Bill still has his edge. He feels so natural, it's easy to believe it's all improvised. He's brilliant. Andie MacDowell is the opposite, she's bloody annoying, as sickly sweet as the small American town in which it's set. There's an odd message to this film though, it seems to be about redemption, a bad soul making amends, but there's an undercurrent of manipulation that's quite sinister and points out some of the worst elements of some human nature. True, Phil does eventually find redemption after a lot of soul searching, comedy japes, worthwhile life experiences and deep suicidal depression... hey even that's given a light hearted twist. But it's troubling to see how long it takes him... an estimated 34 years! I love rewatching these kind of films, it's amusing to spot little things you may have missed before, be it little details or even actors, who were unknown at the time, like Michael Shannon playing the newly-wed Wrestlemania enthusiast. Yes it's schmaltzy romcom territory, complete with an end sequence that doesn't quite add up in the interests of happiness, but despite a few formulaic tropes, Groundhog Day is masterful. The premise, the arc, the characters (annoying or not), the intentionally choppy timeline, all of it barrels along beautifully... and at its centre, Bill Murray. ""I'm A God, I'm not The God"". Bill, I couldn't agree more.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
Bill Murray in one of his best roles,"I don't think anyone else could play Phil as well as Bill Murray. His dry sense of humor goes perfect with the character.

It is the type of film you can watch over and over. A definite highlight in Bill Murray's career.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
As Sure as Heckfire,"No matter how many times I revisit this particular film, the sheer unexpected existential dread it plunges you into always takes me aback. No flimsy early 90s US romcom should have this sort of wildly philosophical depth to them. Sure the third act gets a little flabby and Murray's dated sleaze doesn't feel particularly repentant but for tonal shift sucker punches there are very few films that do it as well. That it went on to define its own whole narrative subgenre is a bit of a testament to how incredibly fresh and smartly assembled the trip down the rabbit (or groundhog) hole really is. So put your little hand in mine...",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
Funny and deep,"I saw this again after 10 years or more had passed since my last viewing, and my appreciation of it--particularly the writing--grew enormously. I had given it 7 stars back then, but I've upped it to 9.This time around, I see the movie as being about two things: 1) how hard it can be to get laid properly; and 2) the eternal recurrence (see Nietzsche--""Thus Spake Zarathustra,"" and elsewhere). The idea is, we should live our life as though it will be repeated, again and again, forever. If that were true, and we knew it, we would strive to make the day perfect in every way. Then, how much better all our lives would be!Why not 10 of 10, then? What the movie lacks is any self-reflection at all. The ideas are there, but because they are presented in the context of a silly idea, and because Bill Murray's excellent performance--the very essence of character development--proceeds only through crude trial, error, and more trial and error, then it takes us repeated viewings to get the point.Another qualm, somewhat minor, is that the piano teacher whom Bill Murray takes on late in the story somehow takes credit for his miraculous development as a jazz pianist: if she is like all the other characters in the story (except Murray), she has only known him for one day and could hardly think that she had taken him from rank beginner to polished professional performer in a single day. I think that by this point in the story, the writers and audience were both getting a bit weary of painstaking plot and character development and were asked to take on sudden change without question.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
Timeless Charm: Groundhog Day's Endearing Message,"""Groundhog Day"" is a timeless movie that captivates audiences with its charm and storytelling. Directed by Harold Ramis and starring Bill Murray, it's a delightful mix of comedy, romance, and introspection that leaves a lasting impression.The heart of the story is Phil Connors, played by Murray, a cynical weatherman who finds himself stuck in a time loop, reliving the same day over and over again. What starts as a frustrating ordeal becomes a journey of self-discovery and redemption.Murray's performance is exceptional, showcasing his range of emotions and impeccable comedic timing. The script by Danny Rubin and Harold Ramis explores themes of self-improvement and the value of each day.The movie is visually stunning, capturing the picturesque small town of Punxsutawney with stunning cinematography. Andie MacDowell and Stephen Tobolowsky deliver memorable supporting performances.What sets ""Groundhog Day"" apart is its ability to resonate with viewers on a profound level. It reminds us to appreciate life's beauty and seize opportunities for personal growth. A must-watch movie that continues to inspire, entertain, and provoke thought long after the credits roll.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
A pilgrim's progress,"It would seem like a pointless exercise - writing a review of a popular film, which has been released almost 30 years ago. Everything has long been written, criticized, rewritten, forgotten and written again. But when you revisit Groundhog Day again with a different baggage of experience than before, you begin to notice those aspects and perspectives that was not previously understood and perceived, even if someone noticed it. I will refrain from briefly describing the plot and praising the witty lines and acting of the ironic-cynical Bill Murray, as well as the charming Andie MacDowell, and focus on the main things.What would you like from your life if everything was allowed (and without any consequences)? I think a lot of people, at least me, will think about their old, unfulfilled dreams, about desires that they did not realize because of saving money, time or fear of consequences. The hero of the film, Phil, received such an opportunity - to become ""a god"" of a small world, the town of Punxsutawney. Having mastered his newfound power, Phil goes through mortal sins, starting with gluttony (a scene of gluttony in a cafe), fornication (seducing local beauties), greed (robbery of collectors), vanity (flaunting a Mercedes bought for stolen money with a young curvy blonde) and ending with anger and sloth (various suicide attempts and apathy). Satisfaction of all desires, as is clear from the sloth in which the hero fell, does not bring him joy. Satisfied desires become the same mindless routine that Phil suffered from before, but now there was nothing to strive for.A new goal is given to him by communication with Rita, with whom Phil is in love (and whom he could not seduce). ""Princess"" Rita, who studied for 12 years in a Catholic school and studied French poetry in college - the embodiment of impracticality, according to Phil, - also embodies in Groundhog Day the moral purity (kindness and beauty) that Phil strives for, but cannot achieve, admitting that he is not worthy of Rita. For the hero, she becomes a reference point and Phil tries to direct his capabilities not to the endless satisfaction of his desires, but to helping others and self-development. He begins to read a lot, learns to play the piano, carves sculptures out of ice, tries to get to know people and their problems. Phil does this ""out of fullness"", like God who has everything and tries to share the abundance with others, which gives him joy. Phil begins to feel joy, helping all the residents of the town day after day. However, he is still not omnipotent and realizes this, trying to help an old homeless man who, however, still dies at the end of the day, no matter how hard Phil tries. Looking at the sky Phil realizes that he is not ""omnipotent"", cannot raise the dead, but can imitate God, doing good deeds to the extent of his capabilities. This is also indicated by the final lines of Joyce Kilmer's poem ""Trees"", which Phil reads to Rita: ""Poems are made by fools like me, But only God can make a tree"". Phil transforms, sincerely loving neighbors as himself and helping them: he saves a boy who has fallen from a tree, the mayor who choked, helps the collector Felix to cure his back, helps the bride with wedding, gives a wedding gift and even buys unnecessary insurances from the annoying insurance agent. Rita notices Phil's transformation and falls in love with him. When the transformation and mutual love bring Phil the long-awaited tomorrow, he decides to stay with Rita in his beloved town, which he no longer considers a deaf and dull province inhabited by ""morons who like blood sausages."" Whether intentionally or accidentally, Groundhog Day depicts the Christian's journey of love, repentance, death, and transformation. Only then does he find his way to ""tomorrow"" through the ""gates to Heaven"", like the heroes of the film, passing into their future through the hotel gate with the camera plan shifting to the sky.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
This is a profoundly funny film,"Bill Murray has done many funny films ""The Man Who Knew Too Little (1997)"" and many profound films ""The Razor's Edge"" (1984). This film is profoundly funny. What would you do if you had all the time in the world? This movie covers just about everything you can think of.Phil Connors (Bill Murray) is a conceited self-serving weatherman. He gets caught in a time warp while covering the Groundhog Day events. Every day becomes Groundhog Day. After exhausting all the fun things, you can do, he has time to confront himself and reflect on what is important.In ""Joe Versus the Volcano"" (1990) people relate that environment to where they work.Groundhog Day summed this up in one statement:Phil Connors asks, ""What would you do if you were stuck in one place and every day was exactly the same, and nothing that you did matter?""Ralph answers, ""That about sums it up for me.""",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"

I'm watching and writing about this right now!,"Groundhog Day is a glorious film that gives a hilarious and sometimes bleak view of what would happen if you had to live one day over and over. It's funny and enjoyable, and while it's greatness is different to, say, Citizen Kane or star Wars, it remains the best temporal displacement comedy (if not movie), and is one of the best romantic comedies. Murray is excellent as Phil, the disenfranchised, broken down, sarcastic weather man who finds himself going over groundhog day eternally. He is perfectly cast, and proves once again why he is one of the best comics who has ever lived. His deadpan face and sarcastic nature are used to full fury, and he is aided by a great supporting cast, including Andie McDowell in one of her not crap roles, and Steven Tobolowsky, who plays the hilariously annoying Ned Ryerson.

Excellent film showing a variety of tones...,"Groundhog Day takes place in the town of Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania. Phil Conners is a weatherman that is sent to Punxsutawney to cover the Groundhog Day festivities for his local news station. Accompanying Phil are his producer Rita and his cameraman Larry. Phil finds the assignment in Punxsutawney to be beneath him and wants to get in and out as fast as possible, unfortunately, the weather does not cooperate and they find themselves stranded in Punxsutawney.Begrudgingly, Phil spends the night in Punxsutawney and when he wakes up, he finds himself reliving Groundhog Day. He is the only person that knows what is happening and he goes through several different stages. He tells Rita that he is a God, he gets depressed and tries to kill himself, and finally, he accepts his fate and starts to better him. He grows fond of the people of the small Pennsylvania town. He eventually learns to play the piano as well as create ice sculptures. Eventually, Phil becomes such a good person and Rita falls in love with him. That results in Phil waking up in his bed, and discovering that it is February 3rd. I feel the theme of this movie is that if we seek true happiness, we must first be happy with ourselves. By the end of the movie, Phil is no longer a grump and has genuinely changed for the better. He is happy.Bill Murray, who plays Phil, is an excellent choice for the lead because of his ""everyman"" appearance. He does an excellent job portraying Phil going through the stages on his way to acceptance and eventually happiness. The tone of the movie changes as Phil's feelings about his fate change. There is an ominous tone early in the film with the storm. That switches to a light hearted tone when Phil is having fun with his new found fate. He steals money from an armored car, seduces an attractive woman, and gorges on desserts with no fear of repercussions. As depression sets in, the tone of the film turns dark again. Phil tries to kill himself in a variety of ways. Finally, when Phil decides that real change and growth are needed, the movie reflects that with a jubilant tone.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"

This movie has this sort of a contagious grip on the viewer like it's a kind of game (as Murray's day keeps on repeating on perpetual loop). A movie that's had many generations laugh out loud, and movie-makers directly inspired from it. In the madness of his ""now-daily routine"", Murray seeks redemption, and isn't that endless loop perhaps a metaphor (that he wasn't doing the right thing in his daily life), and highly reminiscent of the perpetual torments in Greek mythology ?

Simply delightful,"Bill Murray was born to play Phil.  I have never seen him more at ease and natural than in Groundhog Day.  The great thing about this one is it's not just another redemption film where the main character changes his ways based upon one single event. For instance in Good Will Hunting we are led to believe that Will is a whole new person based upon a few counseling sessions. We don't know for sure, but it might have taken Phil years of reliving the same day to get it right.  It's so much fun watching Bill Murray's character change and evolve, and the scene in which he quotes Chekhov is touching and memorable.  Ironically Bill Murray plays the main character in Scrooged, another tale of redemption that couldn't come close to Groundhog Day in terms of originality, script, and imagination.

A Timeless Comedy with Profound Life Lessons,"Groundhog Day is not just a movie; it's a philosophical journey wrapped in humor and charm. Directed by Harold Ramis and featuring a stellar performance by Bill Murray, this 1993 classic transcends its premise of a man stuck in a time loop to deliver a poignant commentary on life, purpose, and self-improvement.The film revolves around Phil Connors, a cynical and self-absorbed weatherman who finds himself reliving the same day repeatedly. At first, he uses the situation for selfish gain, indulging in hedonism and pranks. However, as the repetition wears on, Phil embarks on a journey of self-discovery, learning to appreciate the small joys of life and develop genuine connections with those around him. Murray's performance is masterful, blending sharp wit with moments of vulnerability that make his transformation believable and deeply moving.What makes Groundhog Day truly remarkable is its seamless balance between comedy and depth. The humor is sharp and situational, with Murray's deadpan delivery stealing the show. At the same time, the movie poses profound questions: What would you do if you had unlimited time? How can one find meaning in monotony? These themes resonate universally, making the film as relevant today as it was when it premiered.The supporting cast, led by Andie MacDowell as Rita, provides heart and grounding for the story. The picturesque setting of Punxsutawney, combined with a whimsical score, creates an enchanting backdrop for this existential tale.In summary, Groundhog Day is a masterpiece of storytelling that entertains while encouraging introspection. Its timeless message about personal growth and the power of kindness ensures it remains a must-watch for audiences of all ages.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
An incredibly undervalued film,"Beneath the light and generally upbeat tone of this film lies one interpretation of ""the meaning of life."" Whether you espouse reincarnation or not, the idea of ""doing it over until you do it right"" is something one learns as one ages.Why is it some experiences happen once and others seem to recur in an unending pattern? No matter how hard you try, you find yourself faced with the same dilemma - in spite of a change of location, employment, even significant other.Groundhog Day offers an answer in an easy-to-swallow form. Take it on the level you choose, but if you plumb the depths on this one, you will find it very worthwhile.My hat is particularly off to Bill Murray, who appears aware of the complex task before him, and to the primary writer of the screenplay, who I assume is Danny Rubin. Unfortunately, Rubin  seems not to have followed up this effort with anything of comparable significance - yet.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
25th Anniversary!,"The day depends on how you look at it. This truth really sinks in for celebrity weather reporter Phil Connors in returning to Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, to cover Groundhog Day. Oddly enough, he wakes each morning at the same time and place as the morning before and, unlike everyone else, retains memories from the proceeding day. At first Phil, selfish and shallow, utilizes the new-found knowledge to take advantage of others; stealing the hearts of beautiful women and bags of money. Telling people what they want to hear, of which he has uncanny knowledge, works like a charm. This is until he attempts to woo Rita, the network producer. Phil works relentlessly to get into her head and appear to like everything she likes; French poetry, the piano, acting spontaneously, ice cream and kids, yet Rita is not so easily deceived. No matter what he does, she sees right through him. To win Rita's heart, Phil must change his own.In the 25 years since this film was released it has found a place in the American psyche. This feel good combination of comedy, fantasy and romance currently ranks #233, five places ahead of Jaws, on the widely used film database IMDb. This popularity has much to do with the film's valuable lessons regarding self-awareness and sincerity, and with the appealing star power of Bill Murray and Andie MacDowell (both are excellent here). Despite its simplicity and awful B-movie quality beginning, the film attains unexpected heights in spite of itself. This mirrors the path taken by the main character as well as the film's 25 year rise in cultural esteem. This was the first time I watched the film. Michael Shannon makes a surprising appearance.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
Not just a comedy but a study of man nature,"The movie is a very funny movie but it also studies what would a person do if they had to keep on living the same day over and over again, the only catch is they're the only one that knows that this is going on and you remember everything that happens every day. No matter what you do or how you do it you're not accountable for your actions, since when you wake up after going to bed it's going to be a whole new day. Since everything is exactly the same in the surroundings around you can just rob a bank without anyone being the wiser or something along those lines.This is the type of comedy that's tailor made for Bill Murray where he can be a smart aleck but also being charismatic at the same time. In the movie Murray redeems himself and makes you get behind his rehabilitation into a better person who's no longer jaded by the world around him.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
A JPC Recommendation,"Groundhog Day is my favorite film because it deals with every aspect of life. You know you've felt like it's the same thing everyday before. You wake up, go to school or work, usual usual, come home to usual usual. You can abuse this, make a joke of it, kill some people, or help some people. Depending on how you approach it is what this day is actually about. The story is not so seemingly deep or preachy in the film as I may make it out because it is also entertainment which is how things should be looked back on. The worst experience is the most experience. Bill Murray's deadpan sarcasm adds to the amusement of this experience. I give the film ten stars because only a few films anymore leave an impression on me in a certain way. You see so many films and you get so bored and down with everyday sometimes you need to watch some douche deal with the same problem only in this film it's literal. A JPC recommendation goes to any film that leaves an actual impression on me where most others did not.

human transformation so brilliantly  and touchingly portrayed,"I usually find a comment which sums up my thinking exactly. Here's the one I found this time:""The most underrated movie ever made?, 22 October 1998 Author: Scoopy from Budapest When people assemble their lists of great film comedies, this never appears on the list. It should. It has absolutely everything a great comedy should have.""First, it's funny. Bill Murray is the master of comic insincerity and he plays it to the hilt in this movie. He is a weatherman who is to Ground Hog Day as Ebenezer Scrooge is to Christmas. Fate gets fed up with his attitude and forces him to relive that day until he gets it right.""Second, it's deep. He doesn't get it right the first time, or perhaps for years. He does what any human would do in the situation. Early on, he uses his knowledge of that day to play God. Then, he uses it to have fun and get women. Then, he is filled with despair and tries to end it with his own death. Then, after trying every crass and immature thing he can think of, he finally realizes that he can actually enjoy his fate if he is reliving a great day, so he makes it so. He makes himself a better person, but the transformation happens only after many missteps ... exactly what would happen to anybody really caught in the situation.""How many comedies do you know in which the lead character quotes Chekhov and recites French poetry? (or plays Rachmaninoff at the piano: my comment) Both to good effect (One sincere and touching, the other insincere beyond my ability to describe.) ""Murray is terrific, as is Andie MacDowell. The supporting players are all spot-on. It's just a terrific comedy. It should have won a whole bunch of awards. Why it did not is a mystery.""Besides Scoopy's apt reference to Dickens' ""A Christmas Carol"" we mustn't forget the Flying Dutchman legend as well: a sailor's curse keeps him sailing the ocean forever until he finds a woman on land who can redeem him from his curse with her love. Just like in this incredibly wonderful film: great, unique, undervalued; a treasure, a gem of a portrayal of the transformations of the human heart in which seemingly all-knowing triumphant domination and sexual success are followed by frustration and despair and finally redemption through love: still a great moral fable brought up to date for our time.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"

Bill Murray is also playing one of his funniest character. But the best part of this film is the screenplay. It seems that it was the first try by screenwriter Dany Rubin. He wrote the story, and did co-writing of the script with director Harold Ramis. I don't know which part of the success of this film is due to who, but it doesn't matter.

A film that can change the way you see the life,"A minor thing for me is that the film is refinedly funny and that it develops at a continuous speed that you cannot be boring at any moment. An exception of that may be the first ten minutes, because the main character, Phil Connors, achieves to transmit his personal view of life, as a bitter routine. We, as he himself, don't have the minimum interest in the Groundhog day (sorry for those that love groundhogs). Since the moment that Phil Connors is trapped in time, the film is no more senseless. The thing that makes this film so valuable, and not recognized enough, is that it reflects our own lives. The first time that Phil re-lives the Groundhog day, one can think ¿what's happened? ¿which extrasensorial power has made him to be trapped in that date? Oh, well, it's just fantasy. But when you contemplate all the story, you realize that the reason is in Phil himself, the same as the reason why we live our lives as a boring routine is in ourselves. The first things that Phil Connors makes when he realizes that he cannot scape from that endless repetition, are funny, but nonsense. The happiness that we find in those things that we make to break the routine of our lives are funny too for a short time, but the entertainment ends very quickly, because our lives have no sense. The character of Phil Connors searches different ways of finding how to fill his eternal life, but the only one thing that can give sense to his life is LOVE. Not just the relation with that wonderful (until that moment undiscovered) woman, who is working with him, but love to mankind, to any person that needs us. Love means interest in their lives, in their worries. The way he finally breaks the spell can only be understood by those who have penetrate in the meaning of the film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"

I finally figured it out,"I watched Groundhog Day many times. Bill Murray, Danny Rubin and Harold Ramis are geniuses. Its funny, sometimes sad, optimistic and deeply profound. It is a classic movie.However I never worked out what was the secret to Phil's success; what did he do to break the cycle and finally move on in the end of the movie. Until now.The idea is that Phil after years and years of hard work, self-improvement and embracing change managed to focus his life and form relationships with others through learning many useful skills and achieving his true potential. He became a selfless, decent, mature, giving human being. Right?Well if that is the case then there are a few things wrong with this premise:
1- Most people in the movie are far away from achieving what Phil achieved. Why are they not stuck like he is?2- Yes Phil helped people around town for no selfish reason - he wanted to be good for the joy of it. But all that he did was superficial. He did not really get deep into people's problems, just scratched the surface. Even if he did go deep, why would that automatically make him a happier person? A lot of doctors, psychiatrists, dentists, charity workers and healers help many people, but many of them are miserable. For example, suicide rates among dentists are higher than average. How do you explain that?3- Rita is a nice, warm, optimistic character, but why does it have to be the beautiful young woman driving Phil to change and be a better man? What about Nancy? She seemed nice and did like him also. I didn't see Rita help anyone in the movie, yes she was optimistic and warm but as far as we could tell she doesn't paly any instrument, or sculpt ice and she did not help old ladies fix their flat tiers or the young couple get married. Why is she so special?Groundhog Day is a very nice movie.

A good comedy,"In the Eighties and Nineties, Bill Murray was one of the great comic actors, and this will be one of the most iconic films of his filmography. I have no doubt of that. The film portrays the journey of a television meteorologist to a small American town to cover the Groundhog Day ceremony (a ceremony that exists in real life) on 2 February. It turns out that this meteorologist is a detestable person with a bad and smug personality. Maybe because of this, he ends up getting stuck in time, reliving countless times the same day until he corrects his own mistakes.The film is not clear on the reasons why the main character gets stuck in time. Simply inexplicable, this phenomenon happened and allows the character to do the stupidest things knowing in advance that he will live everything the next day, so there are no consequences. Generally, I do not like movies where strange phenomena occur without the film explaining to the audience the reason behind it, and I may even consider it as a point against the film, but in this case I am willing to make an exception. In fact, this film is so funny and enjoyable that we do not care about the logical reasons behind the story. The movie works just as well: strange, illogical and funny. That is enough.Murray is the right man for the main character. He is the actor who always seems impassive and serious, even when around him the most stupid things unfold, as if all that were normal. And that makes the performance of this actor even funnier and appropriate for the character. Beside you, a capable cast of support allows you even more room to shine.I will not consider this movie to be brilliant. It was not even thought to be. It's funny, it entertains well the audience and makes laugh without exaggeration. This makes it enjoyable, and a good bet for anyone who simply wants to spend quality time.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"

I'm pleased to see that this film is on the top 250 list on IMDb, it SOOOO belongs there, because Groundhog Day is just a perfect comedy.Bill Murray is nothing short of sensational as Phil Connors, the man who visits the town of Punxsutawney to cover The Groundhog festival each year. This to him is a boring assignment and he can't wait to get the hell out of Dodge once his job is done. But fate has a another plan for him, as he awakens each following day and it's always Groundhog Day.This is such a well written, expertly performed and hilarious film and it never fails to amuse, no matter if it's the 10th time you're watching it. The premise is very original, and in lesser hands the film's repetitiveness could have gotten tedious, but with this sure-fire script, Harold Ramis's superb direction and, of course, Bill Murray the film is a non stop laugh riot all the way.Recommended for everybody who enjoys a truly funny film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
"Thoughtful, Spiritual, Comedy & the Ultimate Billy Murray Film","1993's Groundhog Day (A+) is an all-time great comedy that features the best Bill Murray performance of all-time and a surprisingly moving, insightful, and Christian perspective on the meaning of life. The film identifies the sad nature and scope of our human brokenness in Phil and explores how grace and selfless love are his only exit from an existential death spiral. Heavy stuff for a comedy right? Thankfully, the film is able to balance that with the ""can you believe this is happening to me?"" condescending but hilarious smarm of someone like Bill Murray. It turned out to be a perfect casting choice by director Harold Ramis who would get nearly every major choice in this film perfectly right.Murray plays Phil Connors, a self-centered and mean-spirited weatherman for a television station in Pittsburgh. Along with his producer Rita, Andie MacDowell, and cameraman Larry, Chris Elliot, Phil must head down to the small town of Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania to do a remote broadcast for Groundhog Day. Phil hates the assignment, hates the town, and makes it known to his colleagues. He slogs his way through his Groundhog Day duties, tries to escape Punxsutawney, but is forced to return due a bad blizzard. When he wakes up the next morning, Phil is presented with Groundhog Day...again. Something mystical has happened and Phil is forced to relive the day over and over. How will Phil handle it? Will he ever be able to escape the cycle?",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
it's groundhog day....again,"without a doubt, one of the funniest films ever made. Usually, you associate funny with dumb, but with groundhog day, you get one of the most intelligent comedies of all time. Mainly set around one day, which weatherman phil conners must relive over and over again, to his utter confusion, the film just throws out brilliant idea after brilliant idea. Bill Murray will probably never be better, his comic timing is superbly spot on. He could say even the most dull line, and make it funny. And without being intimidated, the supporting actors are all as equally good in their own parts. It gets rather sentimental as it moves on, but still doesn't quit with those great one liners. This movie should replace prozac.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
This is the perfect comedy (for me),"It seems that comedy is the hardest thing to agree on.  I know that I have a couple of friends who are annoyed when they watch this movie, and others who could watch this once a week and love every minute (I am in the second group).  I am sure that whatever I say will be nothing more than an echo from someone else's comments.  In any case, here goes...I believe that Murray is about as funny as they come, even though in each movie he seems to play the same character with different degrees of attitude.  I still can't seem to get enough.  This movie is classic Murray.The story is also a metaphor for reincarnation, repeating the same day until you somehow get it right.  I won't hold that against the movie.To me, this is comedy at its best.  It has snappy dialogue that never gets boring, interesting and quirky characters, just the right amount of sappiness and emotion, a smart story, and it never gets too raunchy.  I enjoyed this movie the first time I watched it, and it gets funnier with each viewing.  It's the only comedy that I would rate a perfect 10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
One of my favorites.,"Bill Murray says it all! He is one of my favorite actors of all time and never disappoints me. The repetition and the comedic timing make this movie one I watch every February 2nd. Also, beyond the humor, is the message that to change your life, you have to live each day as if it were your last. Everyone should at least watch it once, because it is a very unique movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
It Will Always Be February 2 in My Mind,"They say that a symptom of insanity is repeating the same thing, over and over again, expecting different results. Under those standards anyone with a nine to five is certifiable. Yet you add some magical realism and the comedic abilities of Bill Murray and you have yourself arguably one of the best comedies ever put to screen. Certainly one of the best made in the last twenty years.Groundhog Day starts with a particularly onerous Pittsburgh weatherman named Phil Connors (Murray) sent to Punxsutawney Pennsylvania for the annual Punxsutawney Groundhog Day celebration. He lives that day much like any other day; cynical, reluctant and crabby. Thanks to a freak blizzard that shuts down all travel, Phil and his crew (Andie MacDowell and Chris Elliott) grudgingly stay another day in town. Phil wakes up the next morning to find it is once again Groundhog Day with only he having memory of the previous day. Thus Phil is forced to relive February 2 seemingly for all eternity.When first proposed by co-writers Danny Rubin and Harold Ramis (who also directed), studio executives weren't confident that a comedy repeating the same day over and over would keep the audience interested. After all how many times can you see someone say and do the exact same thing hundreds of times without asking for a refund? If you haven't seen Groundhog Day; first off you're a terrible person, and second it's not a movie on repeat.It's a film that dresses an age old hypothetical in new clothes. What would you do if you had all the time in the world? Phil essentially lives forever in a time loop, at first confused, then driven mad, then realizes the potential of his unique situation. He learns everything he can about those around him and improves himself by taking piano lessons, learning to ice sculpt and reading French poetry. How long did it take him to learn all this? Well some say seven years of practice, one hour everyday will make you proficient at anything. Ramis claims that the span of the movie is closer to 10,000 years. Yikes! All that time before internet was readily available? Here to hoping Punxsutawney has a good library.Though focusing on that would take away from the elegant character study and the warm humor of Groundhog Day. Murray transforms from a selfish man into a celebrated pillar of charity and warmth all through the knowledge he has gained of those around him. Does he do this for spiritual transcendence; desire to break the time loop; to get into Andie McDowell's pants; perhaps all, none or something deeper.Over thousands of years of existence humanity is fairly certain of only a handful of things, one of them being we have a unique ability to feel empathy for one another. It's innate and powerful if we only heed to it and one can philosophize that how we structure society, religion and 501(c)3's are largely based on our impulses. Groundhog Day centers on that reality and makes us ponder the value and beauty of human life. When Phil saves a man from choking to death or saves a child from falling off a tree branch he does so out of love for his fellow man.Yet let's not forget, Groundhog Day is ultimately a comedy meant to coax its audience to laugh. Bill Murray's ego-centrism and sighs of futility are the clear comedic highlight of the film and is definitely a career high point for the Saturday Night Live (1975) alum. Yet let's not count out the gregarious supporting work by Brian Doyle-Murray, Stephen Tobolosky and, of course, Andie MacDowell. Also in the mix is Chris Elliott who has the thankless job of playing second fiddle to Murray and somewhat succeeds.The themes of Groundhog Day are benefited by repeated viewing so I highly recommend seeing it again if you haven't viewed it since its last TNT rerun. If you have never seen Groundhog Day watch it as soon as possible and witness a near perfect comedy with a surprising amount of depth. Watch it, and then watch it again, and again, and again. After all everyone can afford to go a little insane every now and then.http://www.theyservepopcorninhell.blogspot.com",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"

A comedy classic that is well written and sends a good message to viewers about self-importance,"One of the best comedies I have watched,Groundhog Day succeeds in delivering comedy through one-liners and sarcasm as well as an original storyline.Bill Murray stars as an arrogant TV weatherman from Pittsburgh who decides to travel to Punxsutawney,Pennsylvania with his producer Rita(Andie MacDowell) and cameraman Larry(Chris Elliott) in order to cover the Groundhog Day festivities in which the rest of the season's weather is determined by Punxsutawney Phil who is a groundhog.Because Phil Connors(Bill Murray) is self-centered,things go bad for him as the day repeats itself which means that Phil is stuck in a personal time warp.Because of this,it means that he doesn't have to worry about tomorrow and gives him a chance to right his wrongs.Besides a great deal of comedy,this film also sends a philosophical message to everyone watching this film that it is never too late to make your wrongs turn into rights.Because of all of this,it has become a cult classic,culturally significant and a film that will never be forgotten.It should have been nominated for at least a Best Actor Oscar for Bill Murray and a Best Original Screenplay Oscar.It is as well written as dramas such as The Truman Show and La Vita e Bella.Definitely recommended and it is Bill Murray at his best.Bravo!",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
It's Been Almost 30 Years...,"This movie came out two years after I was born, and I just now got around to watching it for the first time. I thoroughly enjoyed it and can say that Groundhog Day has held up well after all these years. The film is funny, sweet, romantic, and even occasionally heartwarming. The dialogue is witty and delivered effortlessly by Bill Murray. It's a lighthearted movie, despite getting occasionally serious and playing
around a bit with dark comedy. But it still
works well as something you can watch with
the family. I appreciated the realistic depiction
of Murray's character in regard to his handling
of the whole ""stuck living the same day over
and over again"" situation. It always seems
interesting when a story gets us to root for a
very morally messed up character such as this
film's protagonist. I could see this being a
comfort film for many people.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"

Think how we are all rats running today just for tomorrow, just stop there today, see around, understand others around you, have your day completely fulfilled with people and love around you.Moreover, the film challenges viewers to reconsider their own perspectives on time and mortality. Phil's endless repetition of Groundhog Day forces him to confront the finite nature of existence and the significance of each passing moment. In doing so, the film encourages us to cherish the present, savoring every experience and embracing the richness of life's fleeting moments.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"

Why it doesn't get more attention I have no idea (only thing I could think of is that the original idea came from another film - I'm fairly pessimistic about Hollywood)Murray is fabulous.

the most thoroughly romantic movie of the baby boom generation,"I think when the history of this era is written, the most interesting entry will be for Bill Murray. On SNL he carved out a sort of Andy Kaufman anti-comedy role, the entertainer with no talent who didn't care if you knew; he'd belt out the songs anyway. Which undoubtedly helped cement the rumor that he was the show's dope dealer doing a cameo.Honing the persona year in and out, in Ground Hog Day he's a charmer with no apparent charm, a nihilist with too much success to notice he's depressed. When he gets the chance to reflect, he finds something he really wants, and discovers he has to develop all of his real qualities, hard as they may be to find, to get it. I gave this movie a ten not for its quality alone, but because I think when we ALL reflect we'll recognize it as the signature film of its time.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"

A flawless movie,"I won't say this is the greatest movie of all times since you will most likely disagree with me, but in my world it sure is.Back in good old Sweden this movie was very poorly marketed, but luckily some friends of mine discovered this movie a few years after its premiere and it quickly became our favorite movie. The basic genre of the movie is the ""romantic comedy"" genre, which is flooded by enjoyable but very average movies that makes time fly by without leaving any major impressions. I believe the genre also is the curse of Groundhog Day, people are supposed to leave their brains shut of when watching these kind of movies and no one is supposed to love romantic comedies, you are meant to like them. In my view Groundhog Day is the most underestimated work of art in the movie history....(or it might be that people simply have different tastes and just don't love the movie as I do, but when it comes to Groundhog Day I don't like that kind of thoughts ;) )The movie is about the art of enjoying your everyday life.... ....or it is a philosophical what-if-movie, about the eventuality of someone having to relive the same day over and over again, reflecting on the moral and psychological consequences... ...or it is a beautiful romantic film where someone manages to change into a better person in order to charm the woman of his dreams... ...or a hilarious comedy that makes you breathless while trying to stop laughing.If you don't like some of the different aspects of the film simply ignore them, you will still enjoy the movie.Groundhog Day is in my view the most obvious 10/10 movie.

Phil Conners is the selfish weatherman for the local station WPBH-TV, Pittsburgh. He has no respect for hi co-workers as well as the viewers. He absolutely hates ""Groundhog Day"" which is held in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania. Phil is to cover this event with Rita and Larry who are the new producer and cameraman.

With every new day he has to start over and make sure he gets it right. In this movie the motif is relevant to this movie because it is where they keep repeating the same day. This is important because it helps the view to understand the theme of the movie. The lighting in this movie was high-key lighting which helped create an effective image for the viewers. All Phil Conners had to do was get the day ""right"". Until this happened he would keep reliving the same day.

The best 90's comedy,"Groundhog Day is the best comedy of the 90's and I feel was overlooked at the Oscars in a way. The story is that of Phil Connors (Bill Murray) who has arrived in a small town to cover the Groundhog festival with his producer Rita (Andie McDowell) and camera man Larry (Chris Elliot). But when he must stay in the town for the night, he wakes up at in the previous day and it does so, again and again. This movie has the ultimate gag of all time with the concept of living a day for the rest of your life, it is used with great effect and Harold Ramis the director sets up very neat scenarios and does a time warp of the situations he is in but in different days. Bill Murray is in his prime here and Phil Connors is one of his best characters and his portrayl deserved perhaps a nomination, if Kline got one for A Fish Called Wanda then Murray should have recieved one. The sarcasm of Phil is great and the first cover of the festival is some of the most funny sarcasm I have ever seen. It is a shame that Murray doesn't sometimes write his characters dialogue, because he can handle the use  of sarcasm to the best comedic possibilities. There is one scene in the movie which he improvised, Ned comes up to him and instead of being a wise ass he hugs him, Ned is shaken and while hugging, Murray comes up with... ""I don't know where you're heading, but, can you call in work sick."" Ned obliges politley and runs away, Murray is right on par here in some of his best work. McDowell and Elliot are good too providing solid support but the movie truly belongs to Murray. The two category's this should have been nominated for at the Academy was Best Screenplay and Best Actor, overlooked without a doubt. This film is a very intelligent film, it has such spiritual foundations that it is feel good and also you come away with something new to your life.

Next day, Mr. Fantasy kicks in his life, as he finds himself once again reliving ""GroungHog Day""...

Good clean fun.,"It's really clever fun. When Connors wakes up to find that today is, and always will be, yesterday, he is forced into violently confronting the fact that postmodernism conceives of contemporary life as a spectacle before which the individual always sits powerless, and within which questions of the real are always problematized. To the postmodern subject, there is nowhere else, no other time or place, the subject a ghost-viewer in a movie that plays regardless of his volition.At first Connors uses this opportunity to engage in pranks, hedonism and deceit, concocting schemes to amass money and bed a beautiful woman, played by Andie McDowell, but gradually these games start to lose their appeal. After learning that all the material and sexual gratifications in the world are not spiritually sustaining, Connors grows suicidal. He takes his life several times, but still the curse continues.From here on the plot becomes a mixture of the myth of Sisyphus and Dickens' ""A Christmas Carol"" (Bill Murray is essentially Ebenezer Scrooge), with a little Camus and Nietczhe thrown in. The film's existential avenues are best hinted at by a poem (The Lay of the Last Minstrel) by Sir Walter Scott, an excerpt of which Andie McDowell recites to Connors in a diner: ""Despite those titles, power, and pelf, The wretch, concentrated all in self, Living shall forfeit fair renown, And doubly dying, shall go down, To the vile dust from whence he sprung, Unwept, unhonoured, and unsung.""And so gradually Connors relinquishes the Self. Of course contemporary neuroscience has now thoroughly undermined the notion of a Sovereign Self, but director Harold Ramis is a Buddhist, and Buddhism has long denied the existence of a metaphysical self. Buddhist's call this ""Anatta"", or ""not self"", in which it is taught that all things perceived by the senses are not really ""I"" or ""mine"", and in which a line is drawn from the problem of personal identity to moral responsibility.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
It's deja vu all over again,"Pleasant comedy about cocky TV weatherman Murray sent unwillingly on Groundhog Day assignment, who has to live the same day over and over and over... Murray has never been better, in a role that requires more than just quick wit. Equal to the task is Andie MacDowell who glows as Murray's producer and possible love interest. For those interested, writer Harold Ramis estimates that Murray was stuck about 30 years on Groundhog Day. Some of Murray's lines are classics that come back to me again and again. Light touch still addresses bigger issues about how we live our lives with nice bottom-line message. Effective musical score and great supporting cast. On my all-time top ten movie list. Very rewatchable, but then again that would make sense....",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
A Classic To Be Re-Lived,"Bill Murray nails it as a self obsessed reporter who finds himself in a time loop. His deadpan acting style shines, especially when he plays a glum yet carefree victim to this strange situation. He shines with an odd comedic charisma as he seeming shares, but is actually directly copying without them knowing, interests with people he meets, speaking in a very over the top soft voice. He drives in into maximum overdrive, doing the most outrageous things in peace of mind. The movie also has other things to it, such as Bill Murray and Andie MacDowell's chemistry, making it an experience, where if I was stuck in a time loop watching this, it wouldn't be so bad.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
My favourite movie,"As the film, I watch it over and over.Very nice piece of movie
It worth to watch it in family.You can finish loving every character on the movie.I love watching the barman watching all the scenes around, almost like he has seen it all.Watching it once is not enough to appreciate it.Phill worth more than $399,88 centsIf you love this one, you should Scrooged.It is even funny to see even on February 2nd, groundhog day, as I did yesterday.Today is tomorrow.It must be interesting to find that town and spend Christmas there.Let me know what do you thin about this filmIf you're into repeating-day films, you must also see the serie: Rusiann Doll.How curious what both main characters are sarcastics and they goes into the same path , with a song to make is realise the day has just started over atain.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
Ned Ryerson!,"Until, well, today, Groundhog Day was one of those films that I knew I should have seen because everyone told me it was great but had never gotten around to. Well, now I have and I am glad that I did! Bill Murray's performance is as excellent as you would expect  wry, cynical, charming and, obviously, funny. Andie Macdowell is not horribly annoying in a break from the norm and the concept is attractive and well delivered. My only gripe is that Ned Ryerson needs his own film! What a genius character! I was praying for Murray to knock him out from the first moment he spoke. He's a spectacular comedic creation and really needs his own film, or maybe a spin-off TV show Anyway, good film, go buy.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
Funny Murray,"Bill Murray is a TV weatherman at a Pittsburgh station and has to travel to the town made famous by the groundhog named for his wintery predictions. Phil(Bill Murray) is tired of the yearly assignment with the buck toothed animal when he and a news woman, Rita(Andie Macdowell) travel there for the report. They become stuck in town when a blizzard strikes.Phil begins to wake up on the same day every morning to the radio playing, I got you babe. He eventually realizes that he can use this time loop to gather information and use it to his benefit, including the seduction of his coworker, Rita. Murray is funny as hell and Mcdowell holds her own and Groundhog Day works on every level.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
Best comedy picture in years,"The basic idea of this film, reliving the same boring holiday over and over again, already had a lot of potential. But the actual presentation of it couldn't possibly be done better. And with that it is a fact that any other movies trying to work out this theme are bound to fail hopelessly, as all the genuinely funny stuff about it already has been done in this one. If you've seen Clean Slate with Dana Carvey, you know what I'm talking about.Bill Murray is hysterical, and it is too bad that he rarely appears in a bullseye hit like this one. The rest of the film: the supporting cast, the music, the styling, everything hits the nail right on the head. It is my favorite comedy and I can watch it as often as I want and still I won't get tired of it!",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
A movie like no other,"One of the best comedies and one of the best movies ever made, and one which will grow in stature through time. A 'perfect film'. A 'perfect film' being not necessarily the most profound or greatest film, but one with no discernible flaws. Everything works, the writing, acting, how scenes are put together. Princess Bride is another example of a perfect movie.The plot makes this such an ""odd"" movie. It is its own category, its own genre. I go back to look at individual scenes for themselves. They are varied and wonderful. The absolute best of Bill Murray, and that is saying something. Andie MacDowell at her best too. But the more I see the work of Harold Ramis the more I admire it. He wrote and directed Groundhog Day. He and Dan Aykroyd wrote Ghostbusters. He wrote Animal House. The unique quality of Groundhog Day, the oddness of plot, comes from the creativity of Harold Ramis.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
Masterpiece,"This is a perfect motion picture, an original comedy, a brilliant reflection on life in the latter days, a disguised discourse about faith, relativity, change, love, and chance, under the appearance of a comical fantasy... This happens only once in anybody's life. I mean, to be in ""Groundhog Day""... including Bill Murray, who immensely benefited from this great film. I could not stop laughing the first time I saw it. It is bright, hilarious and profound. Everything good that it merits has been said and written, although a few things were omitted: dumb members of the Academy of Arts and Sciences simply, fully ignored it 100%. Thankfully it was declared National Film Registry in 2006.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
A cinematic comedy of gargantuan proportions,"It is no sooner than the credits of this holy film have gone from the screen that the viewer realizes that he was witnessed the birth of a new Method. Not that of Brando and De Niro, but the aural force emitted from the acting of this spiritual leader, Bill Murray. A majestic performance of astounding subtlety that brings to mind Orson Welles.As Murray cries: ""You're hypocrites! All o'ya!"", his demented lament - one of a soul trapped in parallel universes of existence -  leaves us to ponder on the meaning of life itself and what we make of it. Harold Ramis' direction is a true tour de force, ripping forward to the uncertain (if any) future of the hero. And when Murray jumps of a chapel (campanario/champagnerie), those of us who have not yet suffered a stroke from intensive spasms of laughter, enter a state of shock, a catharsis both on and off the screen.Arguably one of the greatest comedies of all time, this Kafkaesque interpretation of one man and his weather demands repetitive viewing, until the onset of coma. View and be blessed...",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
Classic,This movie is just so timeless I love it. My only issues are sometimes the editing is a bit odd and Phil and Rita sometimes don't seem as believable as I'd hope. Also with the movie being old there's always gonna be some things that feel a little dated.,9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
The best,"This movie is incredible. It is definitely my favorite movie of all time. It's one of those films that could not be pulled off by any other actor.... only Bill Murray could fit this role as Phil Conners, and he fits it perfectly. The incredible extent of his whimsical acting in this film is 80% of what makes it one of the greatest films I have ever seen... the other 20% belonging to the great storyline and supporting characters.This movie can be viewed at any time and still liked. It is a peaceful movie, if you are in relaxed spirits. It is especially great for those nights when you just got home from work or school and the day didn't go as you wanted it to, and you feel though as if life is struggle to no end. This movie is about second chances, and outside of the incredible humor, can be inspiring to get every day of your life right, and to remember the things that are most important in life.Watch it, and see what you think!",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
Classic 90's Feelgood Movie,Bill Murray is on top form in this clever life affirming film that has stood the test of time. Andie MacDowell is wonderful too as the object of the weatherman's affection. Some great laugh out loud moments and a warm hearted core make for a film well worth the investment of your time.,8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
for all time,"A film to remember on the day you die. ""Have a lived even a day in my little life like the last day of Groundhog Day?"" But then Groundhog Day tells us it takes infinite practice to live one such day. Are we then doomed to live out the failed Groundhog Days? Most likely. Perhaps we can shorten the practice period? Unlikely. So the movie is an exercise in envy as the jerk gets a chance to un-jerk his life - no, even just one day of his jerky life.This movie was itself created from 10,000 cycles of filming. It only exited the loop when the director got it perfect. The end-product is what we see now. Awesome.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
One of my all time favorites,"This movie has been one of my favorite movies since the day I saw it. First off, I love the premise. Living the same day over and over would start being really fun, then get old, then become hell on earth.Bill Murry is great as the self-loving news channel guy, and Andie is equally as wonderful as the level-headed and sweet girl that anyone could fall for. Everything is in place for a happy romance. But this isn't all about romance. This about learning to appreciate each day for being alive and having everything you have.Groundhog Day is perfection from beginning to end. The end in particular had me in tears with all of it's sweetness.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
A great feel good movie that's worth watching again and again,"Bill Murray excels in this sort of role - the miserable and self centered guy who gets sorted out by means of a supernatural intervention, (think Scrooged here). His journey through 'I am a god"" enthusiasm, through multiple suicidal tendencies, to finally well rounded nice guy is great to watch.There are really funny supporting performances from Chris Elliott and Stephen Tobolowski, not to mention the lovely Andi McDowell. I particularly like Elliott's face when in a charity bachelor raffle he's bought by a sweet old lady!",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
Surprisingly good film which gets one thinking,"I have never seen a film that so encapsulates the value of our inner self given that time no longer matters. As Bill Murray lives the same day over and over, we learn that given eternity, the only factor that will change is the person experiencing eternity. We see this through him learning French, the piano, ice sculpting. But I think more intriguing than that is the way Phil learns about the people in the small town. I was incredibly impressed by the scene in which he points out several townspeople and tells their stories. Eternity isn't just about one person, but about finding out about everyone else too.I was also intrigued by the small comparison that was made to God. Obviously Phil was nowhere near divinity, but in one aspect I think the movie approached it - the idea of God outside time. Since Phil could just live the same day over and over, he could really get to know every single person in the town, he could figure out what they needed most at certain times and provide help in the best way he could. In a way, this is an incredible insight into the nature of God, and for Christians it is rather exciting since we believe that every day for God is like Phil's day - lasting for an eternity and in that eternity God can give each of us his own personal treatment and help us out when we most need it. Sorry if that sounds a little overly religious, but it really is what attracted me the most to the film.Finally, the film leaves us with the perfect blueprint of how to live life - as if it were to last for an eternity (and for Christians this is true). This means getting to know people and also changing ourselves for the better over time - not superficially like the weather.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"

Perfect analogy for jyj meetings,"I love this movie for all the obvious comedic reasons, but what makes it special for me is how it perfectly captured 4 years of my life at my companies regional meetings. We literally discussed word for word the same issues and solutions for 4 straight years every three months. The only thing different was the backgrounds of the power-point presentations and the % differences in growth quarter after quarter. About 3 meetings into this trend, I dubbed our meetings groundhog day. Did they change? Sadly no, they just started saying, ""we want to avoid another 'groundhog day' in every presentation. I hope you are able to avoid this tragedy at your company. Great movie, and hilarious business analogy.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
The greatest....,"It's one of the greatest films ever!!!It's mostly comedy, but makes a good point. And it has a fantastic cast.If you've never seen it, I'll give you a nibble: Bill Murray is a sour weatherman who hates just about everyone who gets stuck in Punksatowny on Groundhog day....And he can't do anything about it.that's it.
