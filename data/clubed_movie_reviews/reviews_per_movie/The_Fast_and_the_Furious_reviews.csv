Nostalgia train,Is it cheesy ? Definitely. Is it corny ? Oh ya. Did anyone deserve an Oscar? What do you think.Is it a cultural icon that has had a decades long lasting impact on pop culture worth your time ? ABSOLUTELY.Back in 2001 this movie was the next big thing. Everyone wanted a graphic'd out rice burner to drive around town in pretending they street raced.Everyone wanted a Mia or Letty. Everyone wanted to have Dom's muscles and Brian's hair.There's not enough to say about how this movie changed everyone in 2001. Just watch it yourself and put yourself in the mindset of 2001.,7.0,Anonymous,Crime
There's something about Vin,"Every summer a film comes around that takes everyone by surprise.  Last year it was Scary Movie and I'm sure in 1977 it was a film like Star Wars and then in 1981 it was Raiders of the Lost Ark.  Now I am not saying that The Fast and the Furious is in the same class as Raiders and Star Wars, just that it surprised everyone on the same level.  F&F is short on plot and dialogue and even some of the acting is lame, but what it is oozes is testosterone.  It pumps your blood, increases your adrenaline and attacks you with fast cars, sexy women and that one invariable that I think it has going for it... Vin Diesel.  There is just something about the guy, something that you really can't put your finger on, but he just has it. Maybe it is charisma, maybe it is charm, maybe it is just that he resembles some of the action heroes from the 80's with his chiseled triceps and his slabs of pecs.  Maybe it is all those things and maybe it is none of those things, all I know is that F&F is exactly what I had hoped it would be and nothing more.  This is the summer movie that I have been waiting for.  It's not that the films that have been out so far aren't that great because some of them are, it's just that this is the one that epitomises what summer as a teen ager is all about.  It is no wonder that exit polls for this film were around 65-70% under the age of 21.  And maybe that is why I enjoyed it so much.  I am pushing 30 but isn't it cool to lose yourself in a film that reminds you what it was like to be in highschool.  And isn't it cool to watch street racers break 140 miles an hour wile they shoot NOS through their vehicles?  Well isn't it?F&F doesn't contain any machinations similar to a film like Mission Impossible and it doesn't dazzle us with special effects of impending doom like Armageddon did, but it takes us into a world where people live life ""a quarter of a mile at a time.""Vin Diesel plays Dominic Toretto, a massive, bald mechanic that owns a garage but street races on the side to make some extra cash.  Paul Walker ( The Skulls, Varsity Blues) plays Brian Spindler.  He is a cop that has infiltrated the street gang to find out who is highjacking trucks and stealing all their merchandise.  There are about four rival street gangs in L.A. and one of them is pulling this off.  He has to figure out which one. Of course along the way he seduced by the life, but that is not what we really care about.  All we want to see is lots of racing, a few crashes, some fights and some sex.  F&F doesn't disappoint.  If what you have seen in the trailers of the film excites and entices you, then you know exactly what you're in for.  This is not going to win any Oscars for anything but what it will do is entertain you.  It will expedite you for 90 minutes into a world where Honda's are souped up to look like Dragons and junkyard scraps are rebuilt from scratch to be better than they were before, better, stronger and faster.  If this film appealed to you in the commercial, it will appeal to you on the screen.And of course there is Vin Diesel.  He first made a name for himself in Saving Private Ryan where he played Capparrzo.  Then he jumped onto the scene with his excellent and grandiose turn as Riddick in Pitch Black.  I think this is the film that got him noticed because no one had even heard of him before this.  Then he did Boiler Room and he showed a different side to him.  But F&F is all muscle and sheer bravado.  I think Vin is going to do great things in the years to come.  He is not a nobody anymore.  This film will take care of that.  And face it, isn't it cool to see the genesis of a new action hero?8 out of 10-  The ultimate summer rush!",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
The beginning of it all,"This is the movie that created a brand new mega movie franchise. Generally when there's movie franchises they make movies in the form of trilogies. But later this year when Fast and the Furious 6 comes out it'll be the sixth movie in the series which shows the level of box office appeal the series has to be able to pump out an average of 1 movie every two years is quite impressive. The only other series doing that kind of productivity with different directors on basically a once every 2 year rate is the James Bond series.Vin Diesel who outside of his other series Riddick movies generally puts out mediocre to bad performances was basically made to play the role of Dominic Torretto. Same goes for Paul Walker, normally when I see he's going to be in a movie I don't bother watching it. But somehow when these 2 guys get together in a movie about driving fast cars with hot girls it turns into a guilty pleasure.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Surprisingly good,"Officer Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker) goes undercover in the Los Angeles street racing circuits in order to find out which of the racing crews is committing crimes with their muscle cars. But going undercover is never easy, especially with such affable miscreants.The basic premise is really nothing special. But then again, it doesn't need to be. The point of this movie is in its style. It has fast cars, lots of racing, lots of hot, greased-up babes, muscle-heavy men (and cars) and a killer soundtrack. You don't watch it to be intrigued by carefully orchestrated plot points or tragic backstories or the heaviness of its pathos. No, you watch it to kick back, relax and have a good time.And in delivering that, the movie more than delivers. But if it was just that, I'd probably rate the film a bit lower. What actually elevates this film above its immediate peers and helped launch a huge franchise, is the fact that this film is punching above its weight class and succeeding. And it does that by having some real good actors playing roles they were born to play. Walker is one of them, but I also have to mention Vin Diesel and Michelle Rodriguez.The dialogue is also surprisingly snappy and memorable. The plot, while basic, succeeds in making you care for these characters, and it also manages to make itself feel novel, despite arguably being at least a little clich√©d. Once again, the fact that you care for these characters matters a lot.Not a groundbreaking movie by any means, but it has surprising quality underneath all the testosterone being forcibly pumped into your veins.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
A solid entertainment weel done action heist movie,"The Fast and the Furious (2001) It is solid decent action film of the film franchise. I love this film it is my third favorite film in the series. I wasn't watching this film for the cars or street races this film is about robbery, as a string of high-speed electronics truck robberies rocks the area. The Team stole $1.2 million worth of major electronics and the cops doesn't have any leads who has done it. There is only one team that could be responsible, Dominic Torreto (Vin Diesel) and his gang of street racers. During the night Torreto and his crew of street racers are driving cars in Los Angeles. Brian O'Conner (Paul walker) a undercover LAPD officer under the alias ""Brian Earl Spilner"", is he assigned to find out who is stealing the merchandise.This is my favorite film, it is an decent Action film about heist $1.2 million and not about the cars. Why I love this film? Because It is clever, intelligent, Entertained, fast paced and not boring film. The girls are beautiful in this team. The Action sequences are real and perfectly done. I love that late Paul Walker plays Brian O'Conner and undercover L.A. Police Officer who try's to do the right thing. I am Paul Walker fan and Brian O'Conner is my favorite character of the whole franchise and series. I am saying The Fast and the Furious is better than 2,3 and even 7 so the film is pretty good.Paul Walker, Vin Diesel, Michelle Rodriguez and Jordana Brewster did a terrific job playing their characters.With these players set in motion, it's up to the script to deliver the real substance of the movie. (One often sees great performances in mediocre films..here the story transcends the performances -- an impressive feat.) The script delivers. These themes are reinforced by the fine performances by Paul Walker and, particularly, Vin Diesel. Diesel's Toretto is a tough, no-nonsense, street-smart and highly-skilled racer on the outside, but as O'Conner and the audience come to know him, it is revealed that he is a human being with feelings, a troubled and hard past, and doing his best to get along, even if it means skirting or breaking the law. He's the head of a household, and the patriarch of sorts of a gang that is more family than it is a collection of members. Diesel brings hard-nosed and gritty energy to the role, but compliments that with a softer, more accessible side that makes him an odd sort of antihero, a man clearly in the wrong but not maliciously or spitefully so. Walker, too, is excellent as the undercover officer that finds the world of underground racing not-so-seedy as it seems.On the turbo-charged streets of Los Angeles, every night is a championship race. With intense full-throttle action, awesome high-speed stunts, and full-on pedal to the metal intensity, this fast and furious assault puts you in the driver's seat and dares you to exceed all limits.Los Angeles police officer Brian O'Connor must decide where his loyalties really lie when he becomes enamored with the street racing world he has been sent undercover to destroy.It don't matter if you win by an inch or a mile. Winning's winning.The Fast and the Furious is a gritty and gratifying cheap thrill, Rob Cohen's high-octane hot-car is a true rarity these days, a really good exploitation, the sort of thing that would rule at drive-ins if they still existed. The Fast and the Furious is a good Action movie. It offers a conventional plot but populates the story with well-developed primary characters that draw the audience in and make them care about their stories. In the movie, the line between good and bad becomes blurred to the point that, by the end, it matters not which side of the law the characters call home.I love this film to death! It is my 3d favorite film in the series franchise. The Fast and the Furious kicks ass! Even for PG-13 film they kick ass! Brian O'Conner kicks ass!!!",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
It truly is Fast and Furious,"What makes this film so great? One of the many questions you find asking yourself as soon as you pick up the DVD or Video of this film. Well firstly before you dare to watch this film you must be one of these three types of people to be able to sit and watch this film (in my opinion) 1)A person who knows fast cars, 2)A person who likes to see these cars, and 3)A person who knows why you race them.If you aren't one of these people and just want to watch Vin and Paul in action then I'm afraid to tell you that you won't do this film any justice (although they are great in this film). I believe that the character that Vin plays was made for him and so was Pauls' character. Vin already has the style, the mood of Dominic Tretto (we have seen this in XXX) i personally couldn't have picked a better actor for the job for no one could pull it off like what Vin does. As for Paul i think it's great that they have used a so-called ""tall, lean, blonde pretty-boy"" for the part of Brian O'Conner because it brings out the fact that he is an under-cover cop. He's new in the field, it's his first mission and therefore he needs to look it too. We see his character evolve in the second film, which is also truly brilliant. So from me i think that the film should be at least rated at a 7 or 8 out of 10 even though the story does seem to drag on for awhile it is still a pretty good film and i hope you will agree. So from me watch this film and enjoy it too.",,Anonymous,Crime
"An action movie with a some-what plot, hot babes, fast cars, great action and a meet-expectations.","The Fast and the Furious is probably the first movie to get me into cars while at the same time enjoying myself without having to worry about a plot.Paul Walker plays Brian O'Conner, a hot shot police officer, who goes undercover as a car junkie Brian Spilner to see if a local street racer/mechanic by the name of Dominic Toretto (Vin Diseal) has anything to do with hijacking a bunch of cargo from DVD's, TV's, entertainment sets, and so forth while at the same time falling head over heels for Dominic's sister Mia (Jordana Brewster). Brian comes so close while at the same time gaining trust to the target (Dominic) itself where it's only a matter of time before the truth comes out.The film itself has the best action sequences involving street racing and high octane action where despite a so-so plot to follow, or one that's been seen before (such as Point Break), you don't have to worry about a thing. It's just pure fun.The film also stars Michelle Rodriguez (S.W.A.T.) as Dominic's girlfriend, Letty; Ted Levine (The Silence of the Lambs) as Sgt. Tanner, and singer Ja Rule in a small cameo as a contestant against Dominic.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Solid movie... Worth renting,"Today I saw Tokyo drift and yesterday I saw 2 fast 2 furious for the fifth time, but I still find myself drawn toward the original. It stars Paul Walker as an undercover cop who infiltrates the street racing underworld of LA to catch a crook who has been hijacking millions of dollars worth of electronics from 18wheelers, causing the truckers to take matters into their own hands, ultimately ending in deaths and multitudes of money stolen. Now, you would think that because of the semi weak plot, this movie wouldn't be that good, however, the main storyline is just a small part of this movie, the other elements being action and some interesting relationships regarding vin diesels character. Diesel plays a street racing god, one of the best in the LA scene. Walkers character, Brians, way into the world is through Dominic Toretto (Diesel). Toretto has an air about him which draws other in, and Brian is no different. Throughout the movie, Brian is getting to know Dom, earning his trust, etc, but at the end of the movie, both Dom and Brian are forced to make a decision about each other... The whole relationship is interesting to watch. As for the action, there is plenty of it. Besides the many races, there is also some gunplay and some hand to hand fighting, and some interesting hijacking sequences.All in all the cars are hot, the girls are hotter, the cars are fast, the guns are loaded, and for the more serious, the relationship between Dom, Mia, Vince, Letty, and the others is amazing.If you haven't seen this movie, rent it tonight",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

This is purely style winning over substance. The cars look cool and babes look hot. But it's the Vin Diesel presence and Paul Walker pretty boy looks that provide the heart of this movie.

Cunning Cops,"Could there be a movie made in this world worse than this one? Of course there is but this is still a shocking movie. What chance does a remake of ""Point Break"" seriously have? Neither contained a script worth performing, let alone an idea with originality. They both produced ordinary performances from the cast of alleged actors. They also both contained action scenes that were so ridiculous you could only smile at the the disgraceful way money is handed out to pretenders, sorry producers to make this crap.At least ""Point Break"" mixed the action scenes between sky diving and surfing rather than the mundane street racing over an over. Maybe they could have towed someone on roller skates behind the cars for extra adrenaline.",1.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Hot Cars, Hot Girls, Hot Action, What more could you want?","I don't remember when the first time was that I saw The Fast and the Furious but it dosen't matter because it gets better with each viewing. This movie is filled with what guys want to see; Hot and fast tricked out cars, beautiful women, and kick ass action sequences. The world that the characters live in in this film is the world we can only dream of, to race in cool tricked out cars with dozens of beautiful women surrounding you and cheering you on. All of this is what I love most about this film but I also love the cast; Vin Diesal, Paul Walker, Michelle Rodriguez and Jordana Brewster all clinch their roles. If I were to pick my favorite cast member I would have to go with Michelle Rodriguez because not only is she a talented actress she is beautiful and bad ass in everything she's ever been in and this is probably my favorite role of hers. This is a movie were you really don't have to care about the plot because all the eye-candy and fun of this movie is the cars, girls, and action which is enough to pull you into the driver's seat. The cars are fast the action is furious and that's why this movie rocks.",,Anonymous,Crime
"Still ""Fast"" after all these years","Rob Cohen's ""The Fast and the Furious"" has no business being as great as it is. A film about fast cars, undercover cops, and highway robbery should provide limited, perhaps dimwitted thrills, but Cohen's colorful and swift-paced action outing provides such likable characters, slick stunts, and buoyant spirit that the whole affair elevates itself to the highest levels of lively, well-assembled fun. It is a surprisingly robust and satisfying experience.The film follows an undercover police officer working to infiltrate the world of street racing to bust a low-level crime syndicate. While undercover, he develops an affinity toward the racers and inconvenient brotherhood is established. Between the cars, busts, and friendships, a token crime story becomes a tale of family. It is simply compelling and effortlessly entertaining.Cohen creates a multi-ethnic world of sunshine, turbo charged technology, and well-rendered characters. It is a Los Angeles of beautiful paint jobs, palm trees, and lived-in locations. Color, verve, and speed burst forth from Cohen's frames in layered and lively compositions. Editing, design, and music create an always- pulsing energy that permeates every sequence.Though the film is about racing and the thrills that drive the sport, Cohen cast actors that earn as much attention as the horse- powered rockets. Vin Diesel, Paul Walker, Jordana Brewster, Chad Lindberg, and Michelle Rodriguez form the family unit the inspires the film's themes and emotions. Each actor builds a solid character, with the leads being especially memorable. Diesel glowers and Walker exudes a naive charm. They form a charismatic duo.A slick and undeniably entertaining action gem, ""The Fast and the Furious"" soars with its combination of character and thrills. Set pieces are exciting, character beats are affecting, and the stunts are electrifying. It is a remarkable, sweat, oil, and sun-soaked piece of work.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
First drive-in movie of the millenium,"Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker) wants to join the family of the head of California street racing (Vin Diesel)...but why?The plot is comic book level; the dialogue is very VERY bad...but who really cares?  This is a throwback of those dumb 1970s drive-in movies...it's for people who like loud, fast films filled with mindless action, attractive women, cars...and nothing else.  I didn't like the film.  It was too loud, too silly and way too long for a dumb action flick.  What saves it is some truly incredible action sequences (the ""hijacking"" sequence towards the end was unbelievable), some very nice, innovative direction, a cast that manages to be good despite the script and a very good performance by Vin Diesel. This was supposed to be Walker's breakthrough film but Diesel steals it away.  Also it looks kind of silly to have tall, lean, pretty boy Walker against tall, muscular, severe-looking Diesel.See it for the action and Diesel.

It's more than just an action movie.,"This is a great movie. Far from being superficial pulp, this movie has a complex plot. Vin Diesel's performance is tremendous; his screen presence is dominating. He succeeds in carrying the movie. Although the movie contains lots of glitz, it also tells a story that deals with themes such as loyalty and betrayal. The rest of the cast is excellent too, especially Jordana Brewster and Paul Walker. Michelle Rodriguez is as usual wonderful. It would be easy to dismiss this movie as being little more than a live action cartoon, but the movie really is full of surprises. It has several intensely dramatic scenes, some of the most incredible car chase scenes, and some deeply esoteric verbal exchanges fraught with emotion.

Great modern classic!,"There aren't many movies over the last dozen years to have a bigger impact on society than this one. The Fast and the Furious glorified street racing and made the Honda Civic and the other cars featured in the film must buys for teenage boys across America. The reason is pretty obvious, the movie is outstanding. The cast of Paul Walker, Vin Diesel, Jordana Brewster, and others is outstanding and the story is really interesting and unique. The plot and characters are all really well developed, creating an immersive viewing experience not often seen in movies under two hours. The cars and race scenes are fantastic and the action has you sitting on the edge of your seat. The only negative for me was some of the cinematic effects. The director tried to get cute and a lot of those effects actually hurt the scenes, not helped. Nonetheless, those few sequences aren't enough to ruin the film and the entertainment value for the movie is still sky high.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime

"Kinetic, ""hip"" street-racing flick with Vin Diesel and Paul Walker","A newbie to Los Angeles (Paul Walker) falls for a caf√© host (Jordana Brewster) while trying to join a street-racing gang led by her brother, Dom Toretto (Vin Diesel). Meanwhile the LAPD are trying to apprehend a radical group on the highways that targets semis and their valuable cargo. Michelle Rodriguez is on hand as Dom's babe while Matt Schulze plays an angry member of his gang.""The Fast and the Furious"" (2001) was the beginning of the popular street-racing franchise that currently has eight movies with two more planned. The over-the-top action is akin to ""The Road Warrior"" (1981) while the tone mixes the comic book melodrama of ""The Warriors"" (1979) and ""Torque"" (2004) with the more serious air of ""Grand Canyon"" (1991) and ""Training Day"" (2001). (Yes, I realize ""Torque"" and ""Training Day"" debuted after this one; I'm just providing comparative references).Speaking of the tone, there's no goofiness and the actors take everything dead seriously, which is good in my book, but the flick has several unintentional laughs because, while quasi-realistic, the thrills & posing are so exaggerated.Brewster and Rodriguez are effective in the feminine department, but neither do much for me personally. There are a few good-looking ladies in the periphery, however.The soundtrack contains several dynamic urban numbers, including the excellent ""Deep Enough"" by Live.The movie runs 1 hour, 46 minutes and was shot in Los Angeles & nearby areas (San Bernardino, Hemet, Malibu, Westminster, Beverly Hills, etc.).GRADE: B",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

This is a dumb action movie that is just supposed to appeal to a person's shallow senses. The running time of this movie is 106 min.  Maybe 15 min of this movie actually has car chase scenes or action happening on the screen.  A mindless action movie should be at least 1/3 action.

The entire cast did fine, given the script they had and the kind of movie it was.One fatal mistake many action movies try to do is weave in too much drama or emotion, which inevitably ends up looking cheesey and just slows down the movie.  FnF was guilty of this, but only to a small degree.  A brief dive into Vin Diesel's scarred childhood, a little bit of corny romance for Walker, but that's it.  I respect a movie that knows what it is and doesn't try to cross any lines.The movie makers set out to make a movie that presents Import Racing to the masses.  So they had to make a plot to house that movie.  Personally, I think they did a pretty good job.

The start of a franchise that revolve around cars and a big break for two actors,"This movie was a big hit when it first came out in theaters, especially with it's budget.

In another words this is a popcorn flick for most guys and despite the plot not being that good, it still has elements which keeps the movie from being boring or dull. It's one of those movies where it's better to shut off your brain and just accept that entertaining and yet stupid stuff happening on screen in order to have a good time with it. This is also the movie where Vin Diesel and Paul Walker got their big break, and so this movie is the biggest thing that has probably ever happened to them especially when it comes to being in the movie industry. So yeah basically to sum it up, this is a film with a passable plot but has some thrill rides to go with it. Overall the execution was well done, it's a stupid/cheesy flick and yet it's cool and entertaining. Like one of Vin's line in this movie ""You break her heart, I'll break your neck"" it's lame but stands out although most of this movie is pretty cheesy for the most part.7.4/10",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Insanely Fast,"This movie, has by far the best car racing scenes ever filmed, as well as the best cars. They are gorgeous machines, and these guys certainly can drive them. Great story, not just another Gone in Sixty Seconds where all they did was steal cars, there actually weren't very many race scenes as you might expect, but every shot is filled with cars, and lots of them. The acting is great as well, as usual Vin Diesel gives a brilliant performance, as Dominic Toretto. It has already earned a massive following, and when you leave the theaters you will be filed with such a massive adrenaline rush, that you and all your buddies will be left with the feeling that you must go out and race. Everybody I have talked to have said the same thing, it just has this crazy adrenaline rush it gives you. I highly recommend this to all fans of cars, and racing, but it has something for everybody so see it even if you are not a fan of either, bottom line, just see it!!!!!!",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
the first ride,"It's strange that one of the best franchises in movie history started off with Vin Diesel stealing a bunch of VHS players. Make no mistake about it, under the corny dialogue, awful soundtrack, horrid direction, and a general sheen that makes it clear that this is a 2001-ass movie from 2001, this is also at its core a Fast & Furious movie. So in preparation for the impending release of Furious 7, let's look how the film that started it all held to the franchise's tenants of Life, Cars, and Family.Life: Although the ""I live my life a quarter mile at a time"" mantra is corny, I think it plays well in the streets of the film's world. A world where respect is everything, but that respect has to be both earned and backed-up with actions. It means taking big risks, knowing your priorities, but also living in freedom of choosing your own destiny. While Dom's arc here is learning to live with that freedom, by his own code of honour, and the consequences and all it entails, Brian's arc is about earning that respect and choosing how far he's willing to go to get it. It may not seem a lot, but I think it speaks a lot to their arcs throughout the entire series, especially when you see how awkward Brian is at the beginning, knowing he'll eventually become one of the coolest and most respected white dudes on the planet later.Cars: Although originally envisioned as a movie about street racing, the film actually grinds to a halt when people stop to race. Director Rob Cohen is as bad at directing as he is at acting (As that Pizza Hut guy annoyed by street racers) and manages to make the races both boring, but also hideous to look at. He adds several horrible effects to each racing scene to convey speed and excitement, both CGI and otherwise, but it never feels, or looks right, and they also never sound right. Seriously, when people aren't talking, Cohen turns the film into some god-awful ""nu-metal"" or ""rapcore"" music video. All he needed was to add some crunk, and he would have completed a devil's threesome of best-forgotten 00s music genres. What is good however is how Cohen handles the heist, which the series would eventually realise is much more interesting than racing, which they prove here. Cars drive under trucks, people jump from cars to trucks, and people jump from trucks to cars. It's nothing the series wouldn't do better later, but it's still edge-of-your seat classic action, complete with a last minute save by our hero, Brian. As for the cars themselves, the only truly memorable one is Dom's classic Charger, which plays heavily into his back story.Family: Again, this movie is strangely best when people are talking, and not racing. The film obviously establishes the code of honour and of respect, but it's also about family, which the series is ultimately about. I forgot that they go into Dom's back story here, and why family is so important to him as he establishes one in the absence of his father, while being welcoming to all who gravitate towards him. His code of family really drives the film, and his accepting of Brian builds both Brian's character of being a good man and saving Dom, but also Dom's appreciation of Brian not leaving him behind build's up Dom. Family doesn't leave each other behind, and they watch each other's back. The film tries to make us think Brian's desire to help Dom is Mia-based, but I think he just really wants to be apart of that family, and Ted Levine even says he has to make a choice about which family he wants to be apart of. He kind of chooses the police in this film, but his actions here come back where he finally makes his choice in Fast and Furious.Overall, if you can get past the horrible direction and how dated the film is now, there's actually a lot to like here from the above and beyond character work, to the heist gone wrong. I never cared for this film when it came out, but looking back it has the early shine of the elements I love of this series. It's flawed, but I still like it.RIP the great Paul walker",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

My Most Hated Film,"Normally I don't comment on films that I knew I wouldn't enjoy just by seeing the trailer. But I was reminded of this atrocity when I recently saw a news blurb about another installment of this franchise and remembered when I saw it for the first 5 times. I was serving in the Navy back in 2002 and our IT department ran a channel shown on the ship that shows movies. Apparently, someone thought it would be a good idea to show this film over and over.This movie manages to be offensive on so many different levels that it boggles the mind and violates it at the same time. The plot is unoriginal and base, the dialog is poorly written and poorly delivered, the editing is like an epileptic seizure, and yet somehow it is overglossed and shined up. Kinda like a polished turd.And as if the film wasn't just badly acted and written, it also manages to offend just about everyone with an IQ above a 10 year-old who views it. I'd say it's misogynistic, but there are no women in this movie. There are material possessions that resemble women, but when their function is to be placed on the hoods of cars for decoration, won in races, or used against other men for position, than basically you've turned once promising actresses into blow-up dolls with heartbeats. There's also plenty of racial stereotyping. Whites, Hispanics, and Asians frequently insult each other based on skin color, but hey, that's hip, yo! But I'd have to say this film is more insulting to me as a man. If you believe this movie, then all men are insecure, materialistic blowhards who are in constant competition and serve only to one-up each other. Whether who has the faster car, who can break the law more, or who can get closest to the ever elusive ""menage a trois."" And what's sad, is that I've seen so many trailers for films that seem to ape this MTV culture of immaturity, faux-machismo, and flash-zoom editing since that basically make this the culmination of all that is bad in films today.I try to see the good in all movies, and if I can't, then I just say ""it's not my thing, but if someone else likes it, good for them."" This is the ONLY film I cannot let off the hook. It is unforgivable and I loathe its very existence.",1.0,Anonymous,Crime
a hot film,"Apart from the fact of Paul walker and Vin Diesel being absolute hotties, a hot soundtrack and above all the craziness of the cars themselves.The fast and the furious portrays an action packed movie all about street racing and racing machines. Cars injected with N.O.S running 9 second elapsed times in it self has me on the edge of my seat. You actually feel an adrenalin rush. Ja Rule's debut well - lets say i'm not a fan, But he is kind of funny. The dialogue is some what cheesy and there is the common stereotype of the Asians being the bad guys, but aside from that i loved the movie and i can watch it over and over and not get sick of it. It's not the dialogue you're interested in when you watch this movie, it's the cars. And cars is what they give you. I give this movie a 7 out of 10 & i would have given it an even higher rating before i started analysing it. But this is my final thought.",,Anonymous,Crime
The start of Universal's biggest franchise to date.,"A slick, adrenaline-fuelled action flick featuring a hot cast, a cool soundtrack, and countless custom cars, The Fast and the Furious is designed primarily to appeal to the young petrol-head crowd‚Äîthose who would spend a fortune on a sound system for their ride and then blast crap music out of the windows while sat in a McDonald's car park (at least here in the UK). Anyone heavily into car culture will probably wet themselves in excitement over the modified machines on display.But even if the idea of highly-polished Japanese street cars with more expensive accessories than a Kardashian doesn't get your pistons pumping, there's always the human eye-candy: for the ladies, there's blonde-haired, blue-eyed Paul Walker and bald bit of rough Vin Diesel, while the guys get numerous tasty young women to ogle, including Jordana Brewster as Vin Diesel's younger sister and Michelle Rodriguez as feisty girl-racer Letty. We also get lots of impressive stunts to keep the pulse pounding, with a great chase scene featuring one character dangling from a truck cab while being shot at by the driver, and a white-knuckle jump across railway tracks in front of an oncoming train that results in a spectacular crash.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Simply best  movie ever,"Not only because it was shot at my hometown (Los Angeles CA) but, it has every essence of a great film. This to me is the best movie of all the FF franchise. This movie touches action, love, hate, friendship, adrenaline etc. It has a great storyline to keep you entertain. This movie I believe was very successful not only because during that point during the American culture Auto Tunning was reaching its peak but because of the actors selected. At that time these were not world wide icons and had not been involve in a blockbuster movie that would tattooed their careers in Hollywood. Finally I just want to point out that I am no movie critic or someone who studied in order to criticize a movie, I am simply an average Joe that likes to see all kinds of movies but, specially action movies been The Fast and the Furious my favorite movie of all times.

A perfect 10...,"I just saw it for the thousand time, and it's still as good as the first time I saw it. Rob Cohen is a pure genius, he truly is. These movies are magnificently awesome and I'm going to tell you why. No Spoiler alerts I promise.Let's start with the basics. The script and plot is close to perfection. Everything from Action, comedic feuds, deceit, romance and amazing surprises. It has a little of everything and a lot of the rest.The characters' difference is brilliant. The background of them is hidden beneath the surface of someone completely different. They're just amazingly entertaining. They're personalities is even better. I can't say anything else because I'm out of words; speechless.The action scenes are incredible for a movie like this. I won't say to much about them though, but if you haven't seen it yet, do so. The first scene when you see how good Brian drives is good and when you see the spark he has, and how his driving improves throughout the movie; nice, very nice.The turning point is pretty good too, but you'll have to find it yourself because I am not going to spoil your movie-experience. The twists in the movie are good, and there is more than one as well. Everyone has secrets, and the secrets are what make this movie just as good as it is. Without the secrets the movie wouldn't be worth watching.OK, let's talk about the acting. First, Mark Vincent (or as you may know; Vin Diesel), I'm a big fan for a reason. There's never anything to say on his acting, so I won't even get into how amazingly amazing he is. So, the rest of them, I am a little iffy on their names so I am just going to call them by their character names. Brian, or the guy who played his role in the movie did a great job and so did Mia and Vince. There wasn't any bad acting in the movie, only good acting and some awesome acting.The mix of secrecy, trust and romance is pretty damn good. I'm running out of adjectives. So I'll just try and wrap this up and give you my concluding opinion and rating of this movie.This movie is definitely worth watching. I really and truly recommend you to watch this movie and its following movies. They are worth watching, ask anyone who've seen them they'll tell you the same. Personally I think it's great and awesome and so does my pal here who watched it with me an hour or so ago. For my rating, based on everything I wrote and didn't write, I give it 10 out of 10 stars. Why? I couldn't find anything negative about it and since I still enjoy watching after all these times I've already seen it it's probably worthy of a perfect 10.Rating: 10/10Thanks for reading my review.

A fine example of cinematic adrenaline and incredulity,"The Fast and the Furious is, at the very least, an intriguing franchise, for it gives gearheads the kind of inspiration and fantasy they need to have to keep sane. I've always found car hobbyists to face quite the paradox; the problem with cars is that they are grossly expensive, so if you're a middle class man, having two is quite the luxury. However, if you're deep into cars as a fascination, you presumably not only want one or two cars, you want several, and you want them customized and rigged to your liking. Customizing and optimizing the performance on one car is grossly expensive, but having a garage of half a dozen or more customized/optimized vehicles could cost as much as your house and your neighbor's houses put together. This is why, each and every day, I'm more and more satisfied with my lack of interest in cars and my own obsession with the Honda Accord I drive.The Fast and the Furious also gives gearheads that kind of adrenaline rush and visualization of their dreams realized because they, themselves, often don't have the means, the vehicles, nor the kind of closed-range courses to carry out the kind of eye-popping stunts and mayhem the characters in these films cause. It caters to that level of unbridled excitement, when you're actually racing in a vehicle and that moment where you get that indescribable pang in your chest reminding you know that you're alive. I was fully ready to embrace this franchise for its fantastical elements, but unsure if I could still be entertained watching car chases and death-defying stunts for an upwards of two hours.What's pleasant about The Fast and the Furious is that it focuses on the relationships the characters have with one another in the midst of all the racing. The film's slender plot revolves around Brian O'Connors (Paul Walker), an undercover Los Angeles police officer sent to infiltrate a ring of truck hijackers and street racers in the heart of L.A.. Led by Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel), a suave know-it-all when it comes to vehicles, the gang is known for their heavily armed carjacking activities of large eighteen wheelers, in addition to their work at auto-body shops where they modify and customize cars, some of which flirting with and others unabashedly breaking the laws of what is street legal. Also working in Dom's crew are Leticia Ortiz (Michelle Rodriguez), his longtime girlfriend and mechanic at his shop, in addition to his sister Mia Toretto (Jordana Brewster), whom becomes the apple of Brian's eye late in the film.Brian's infiltration of Dom's ring soon becomes corrupted by his fascination with the culture Dom and his crew have created; it's a culture that specializes in prompting and maintaining a longterm adrenaline rush in the most unique and heart-pounding ways. Despite Brian's responsibility to uphold the law through all this, he finds his involvement with Dom going above and beyond the call of the law, as far as hooking up with Dom's sister and helping Dom plot a crackdown of former partners that have turned into rival gangmembers following a reneged agreement.No matter which way you slice it, The Fast and the Furious is slight in substance, but often very strong on a level of entertainment. At only one-hundred minutes, it pleasantly skates by without being too much of an assault on the senses and operates largely on the charm and infectious personalities of its actors. Walker is the standout of the crowd, maintaining a certain level of cool and street-smarts and his character never hitting the level of cocksure confidence, making him a more watchable and likable presence. That's not to undermine Diesel's role here, because without him, this film wouldn't be as much of a bromance as it already is. From the first race, it is clear that Walker and Diesel have enough chemistry to create a bond between two opposite characters in terms of life paths in order to go on many more adventures with one another. The supporting cast of Rodriguez and Brewster are fine, though even in more masculine roles, the two feel like nothing more than decorative pieces of eye-candy that help further the plot along when convenient.But perhaps such was just destined to be the case in The Fast and the Furious, a film where escapist tendencies take over and nothing else matters besides the moment when your car begins to redline or a part becomes misplaced in Dom's garage of odds and ends. Being that this film largely predicates itself on male bonding and the thrill of racing from both an illegal and adrenaline-charged angle, The Fast and the Furious largely possesses a homey quality that makes it believable and grounded in reality, despite a certain conclusion with a certain train that, I confess, was still entertaining in the realm of cinematic incredulity. This is a fun and effective film in being every gearhead's fantasy and being a damn fine piece of entertainment.Starring: Paul Walker, Vin Diesel, Michelle Rodriguez, and Jordana Brewster. Directed by: Rob Cohen.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
A good fast paced action film,"To go in and watch The Fast and Furious, it is a lesson in expectations as it is obviously not a masterpiece, and you should not expect it to be either. it does exactly what it says on the poster though and the film is fast and the action is furious.The story of Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker) who is a undercover police officer. Trying to breaking on to the Street racing scene. Through Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) so he can bring down a crew who are hijacking trucks. The thing with the film is that in a lot of ways it is terrible. I'm not a Rob Cohen fan, of all his films this is probably the best of his work in my opinion and only challenged by 1996's Dragonheart. In acting terms Paul Walker is a good looking guy but lacks real acting talent and charisma on screen. Vin Diesel though does have good screen presence, and at times I think is an underrated actor. The supporting cast is generally OK except for the insufferable and thankfully only in it for a short period Ja Rule, and the definitely not very intimidating Reggie Lee as the main protagonists henchmen.What is surprising and actually good about the film is that it does have a nice simple plot and develops the characters as we get to know about Dom's father and his childhood, and see Mia Toretto (Jordana Brewster) and Brian fall in love. The Car chases are decent and again are practical effects, which are better than CGI Green screen chases uses in some of the sequels. Praise also has to made of the final sequences involving the final hijacking, the chasing of some drive by shooters and the final race off. which were very thrilling and kept you on the edge of your seat until the end.I can't say i love this film, because i don't. But i did like it and enjoyed the ride while it lasted.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

The film that made a lot of actors popular,"Upon first reading the title, viewers would get the first impression that this film involves just racing cars. In a sense, it does but in a different way than your standard track race of 99 laps. It involves much more than that and to demonstrate this, a cast of actors were chosen for this franchise that have taken the genre of driving cars to the next level. This is the movie that brought several no name actors to the spotlight. The most obvious is Vin Diesel and Paul Walker. And what almost seemed like would be a strange mashup of racing and detective work, turned out to be a fairly solid film.Paul Walker plays Brian O'Conner, an undercover cop who is trying to help the FBI capture a group of road bandits who end up plundering innocent truck drivers traveling down highways. To do this, he digs deep into the underworld of street racing where racers of different backgrounds and revved up cars come together for a common cause. The thrill of the ride and all the benefits that come with it; sex, drugs, respect and money. As he slowly assimilates with his surroundings, he befriends a man named Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) and his family members. There he begins to investigate who is behind the truck jackings.This is actually not a bad plot at all. The writing does have its weak points, which will be touched upon but let's start with the positive. I enjoyed how O'Conner has to come to grips with himself and who he's going to support. This shows that he's a human being and has a conscious. The same goes for Dominic Toretto, in a different way though. Toretto must come to grips with himself knowing he wasn't the person he once was. Both characters are from very different worlds yet they share a struggle that resembles each other. That struggle is being human and knowing who you are as a person. Sure it's not believable in every aspect but at least it lets the audience know that these characters do have a mind of their own.The weak part to the film is the final scene. All there is to say is that it is too abrupt. It completely detours from what the plot was centered on, along with leaving a few subplots open for interpretation. But was it needed - no. It would be nice to see some closure on more than one subplot. Surely if this franchise didn't earn a sequel then where would the conclusion to this story be? Hard to say. But if there's one thing that helps make up for that are the racing sequences to this movie. Even if you're not a racing fan, the action scenes should entertain. I mean, who doesn't want to (or enjoys already) driving over the speed limit for fun? Driving at high speeds gets the adrenaline pumping and makes every action much more intense. So if you don't enjoy that kind of thing, this movie isn't for you.The editing by Peter Honess who also did The Shadow (1994), L.A. Confidential (1997) and Highlander (1986) did a good job here as well. The shots are well connected and will keep the attention of the audience quite easily. The score produced by BT isn't anything to praise over though. Some action scenes didn't even contain music, which was odd because you'd think one would want to make that scene more intense by adding music. And although he doesn't create a theme for the franchise, his music does match the tone and attitude of the film. And for this kind of film, as long as it maintains that, that's all that matters. Because there is also contemporary music inserted in various scenes, BT's music transitions well into the contemporary music. It's good.It lacks logic in a few areas and has a loose ending but the car scenes and actors help them overcome that. Plus it has some unexpected character development that helps give the main characters a good amount of charm.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

A lemon,"I don't think this movie is worth much at all.  Too many stupid scenes, too much bad acting, too much to appeal to a 15 year old and no one else.  None of it was clever, interesting, realistic or worthwhile.The actors all have exactly one expression - anger - and they never stray far from that.  I think they all took the second half of the title too seriously.  Why are they furious anyway?  What do they have to be furious about?Paul Walker literally sleepwalks through the entire movie and if Vin Diesel is the new action hero for the new generation, I want a recount.  I liked Jordana Brewster a lot in ""The Faculty"" and was looking forward to seeing her in this, but she's wasted.  Michelle Rodriguez is cementing her future as a tough girl doing movies like this - wasn't she in that female boxing movie too?The only positive thing I can say is that the movie seems to have some respect for its audience.  By being rated PG-13, at least the people who would most benefit (!) from seeing this garbage would be allowed in.Racing scenes are no great achievement, either. Stupid, stupid, stupid.

A buddy movie with a heart,"This was my first experience with the Fast and Furious series and I wasn't disappointed. A charming Hollywood version of Rebel Without a Cause mixed with a somewhat unconvincing heist film. But at heart it's an old fashioned buddy movie, with Vin Diesel and Paul Walker as handsome and charismatic leads. (It's no surprise that they would return for future episodes of the series, until Walker's tragic death in 2013.) Not much is made of their female counterparts, played by a sultry Michelle Rodriguez and the very beautiful Jordana Brewster. You might say that the real leads of this film are the cars, but although a lot is made of the technical side of things, the focus fortunately is on the people behind the wheel.

A Thrilling Classic That Started It All,"""The Fast and the Furious"" speeds onto the screen as a thrilling and groundbreaking action film that kick-started one of the most beloved franchises in the industry. Released in 2001, this movie introduces us to the world of illegal street racing and the adrenaline-fueled lifestyle that accompanies it.The plot centers around undercover cop Brian O'Conner, played by Paul Walker, as he infiltrates a gang of street racers led by Dominic Toretto, portrayed by Vin Diesel. As Brian immerses himself in this high-octane world, he finds himself torn between loyalty to the law and the bonds he forms with his newfound ""family"" on the streets.What sets ""The Fast and the Furious"" apart is its raw energy and authenticity. The film captures the essence of the street racing subculture, immersing viewers in a world of modified cars, intense competitions, and the adrenaline rush of illegal racing. The attention to detail in the car sequences adds a layer of realism, making each race feel exhilarating and dangerous.The performances in this film are solid, with Paul Walker and Vin Diesel leading the way. Walker brings a sense of youthful enthusiasm and determination to his role, while Diesel embodies the brooding and magnetic presence of Dominic Toretto. Their on-screen chemistry drives the narrative forward, creating tension and camaraderie.""The Fast and the Furious"" delivers pulse-pounding action sequences that have become the signature of the franchise. The car races are expertly choreographed, blending practical effects and stunning visuals to create heart-stopping moments. The film's soundtrack also deserves recognition, as it perfectly complements the fast-paced action and adds to the overall atmosphere.While the plot may be straightforward, the film succeeds in capturing the spirit of rebellion and the thrill of the underground racing scene. It taps into universal themes of loyalty, family, and self-discovery, resonating with audiences beyond its target demographic.""The Fast and the Furious"" remains an important entry in the franchise, laying the groundwork for the high-octane adventures that would follow. Its impact on the action genre cannot be overstated, as it introduced audiences to a world of fast cars, intense races, and memorable characters. This film is a must-watch for fans of the series and anyone who appreciates adrenaline-fueled entertainment.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
It will leave you dazed and breathless.,"It begins with a spectacular action scene where three Honda Civics execute a high-speed highjacking of a cargo truck, and from there, the action never stops. With The Fast and the Furious, director Rob Cohen seeks to capture and thrill the audience with a booming soundtrack and non-stop action, and he seems to have succeeded.The film follows officer Brian O'Connor as he infiltrates a street-racing gang in order to capture the drivers of the three enigmatic Hondas, which have been terrorizing truck drivers in Los Angeles. The gang is led by ex-racer Dominic Toretto. Toretto immediately takes a liking to O'Connor, while his gang seems a bit skeptic. Toretto's right-hand man Vince is O'Connor's main problem, as he suspects the truth about his identity from the very beginning.The plot is slightly dry, as the movie incorporates many typical aspects of other films of the genre. For example, there's the fact that Toretto is the only one to trust O'Connor. The rest of his gang except for, of course, Vince, quickly follows him. Then there's the whole falling-in-love-with-the-sister-of-the-guy-I'm-about-to-get-arrested subplot. And then there are your typical problems from rival gangs and the hero's attempt to prove himself by striking against them. Yet despite the many stereotypical aspects of the script, the well-developed characters and interesting relationships save the movie from becoming just another heap of typical Hollywood sensationalism.The movie features strong acting, as the actors work well together and compliment each other's performances. This is only Michelle Rodriguez' second major performance since her film debut in the independent drama Girl Fight, which was a hit at the Cannes Film Festival last year. Not just another bad girl, Rodriguez shows a strong acting ability, which is apparent in her portrayal of Lena. Vin Diesel is also a fairly good actor who seems to be climbing through the ranks of Hollywood. Best known for his role in the failed science-fiction thriller Pitch Black, Diesel sports a memorable attitude and strong screen presence that promise to make him a contender for future stardom. Opting to cast less known, yet strong actors instead of more commercially viable ones, Rob Cohen has created a well-rounded cast, which gives the movie its fresh attitude and memorable mood.Yet it is the action scenes that are the real stars of the movie. Featuring three races and four equally spectacular action sequences, the movie delivers fast and furious action from beginning to end. Accompanied by a rocking soundtrack, the action sequences are put together by flawless editing and elaborate stunts, effectively creating a maddening adrenaline rush in any viewer.A long time producer and Harvard graduate, Cohen has achieved success a director, with movies such as Dragonheart, The Skulls, Daylight, Dragon: The Bruce Lee Story (which he also wrote and starred in) and several episodes of the series Miami Vice. He is also a screenwriter and has had small roles in some of his movies. He plays a pizza delivery boy in The Fast and The Furious.Although the slight semblance of a plot does not make this something for the serious moviegoer, the relentless action more than makes up for it. Not too long and filled with fantastic cars and non-stop entertainment, The Fast and the Furious will leave you dazed and breathless.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime

In gone in 60 you have 2 scenes with cars driving fast at all.  Here you have at least 6 or 7 distinctly different and memorable scenes. Although acting ability and some of the lines lack severely, this can be forgiven and is made up by the cars. This movie is perfect for anyone into speed and tuned import sports cars for the most part(yes, even the occasional despicable economy car made to ""perform"" is present)I saw the previews knowing this was going to be basically an adrenaline rush of a movie, and I gave it a 10 because that's what it delivered.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime

Brilliant film!,"Hot cars...sexy actors?!? What more could anybody want? LOL I thought this film was brilliant the first time i saw it in the cinema, the bass in the backing songs and the revving of the engines made the cinema vibrate and this added to the atmosphere of the whole film.I loved the acting, the actors and actresses were chosen suitably for the part they played, for example you'd never know that Michelle Rodriguez (Letty) wasn't originally written into the script and they had to create a part for her, everything works so well. The friendships that were found and the TEAM efforts meant everyone was included (maybe with a little rivalry between Vince and Brian at the beginning) BUT it all worked out in the end showing that friendships over ride all.The cars were brilliant (me i love my cars!) but these were SEXY cars with popular names and each car suited it's actor / actress down to the ground.

GREAT START AHEAD OF THE FRANCHISE,"What I liked most about this movie was the beautiful story and background given to Paul Walker's character.

The director was smart in acknowledging the fact that there needed to be a balance of ""fast and furious"" as well as slowness and really taking the time to provide a good story arch and giving justice to the characters portrayed.

This, I guess, is the reason for why someone reader of IMDb commented that in this movie Vin's talent was wasted.

Back in simpler times,"This one reminded me of when the Fast and Furious franchise used to be synonymous with racing, when the makers were more concerned with automobiles and the engineering that goes into them than with staging a variety of fast-paced, nonsensical action set pieces.The narratives at that point in time used to be routine though, not much emphasis were given but they had these characters who seemed relevant and to whom one could relate, as opposed to the present scenario where everyone is treated as if they have superpowers.While I adore (to a certain extent) these updated over-the-top world-saving notions, this is not what F&F was set up for. I think that the creators need to go back to their roots, their origins, I feel that's the only path left to redeem themselves as well as this series.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
An absolute farrago that frankly fails to entertain.,"I gave this film every chance, but at every turn I could not quite believe the extent of its failure as both entertainment and film-making. My mind was much as antagonized as were my ears by this film's far from unique blend of noise, nonsense and numbskullery.Rarely if ever have I been rendered so disinterested in a movie's opening in particular than with this film. No attempt is made to draw the viewer in whatsoever, with shoddy direction of unrelated, uneventful scenes. The ""effect"" of the car scenes is but one-trick-schtick. The music is unimaginatively chosen, and in its blaring merely adds to the unsubtle, dulling overall effect of such scenes. There really is nothing original or particularly impressive about the director's use of visuals and sound.The acting is resolutely bad in a semi-laughable vein. If this ""Diesel"" chap is one of Hollywood's ""brightest up-and-coming stars"", he does little to show why here. His one-note performance consists merely of risible, cliched ""hard man"" posturing, inane shouting and a touch of the insufferably phony. This actor exudes none of the magnetism and genuine cool of, say, Robert Mitchum or Paul Newman, who could both act a bit as well... Diesel and Paul Walker, as the two leads, really do fail to induce any interest. The token ""emotional"" stuff is, as others have commented, utterly laughable. That one pathetic scene of this ilk has caused other reviewers to brand the film ""multi-layered"" and the like, is even more laughable. Trite lines delivered in a stilted, faux-sincere manner make for unintentional amusement and nothing besides. The main female actors are just as ineffectual; their characters are so thin they may as well have been reduced to the eye candy status of various other female ""extras"" on show throughout the film. That is not say, mind you, that genuine allure is generated at any stage... it's all rather perfunctory and sanitized.The plot? Well, indeed I don't *expect* such action movies to be well scripted and interesting, but it would make a change if one actually was. There is no serious attempt to provide a cohesive story line, attempt to twist the formulaic or be at all offbeat. The bones of this script are chronically malnourished and boundlessly bare. The way plot strands are introduced and just as soon discarded without reason, just illustrates this. The writers and director are either being condescending to their target audience, or, remarkably inept - if they consider this script of any merit at all. Also, the lack of humour renders the film toothless, with the drag racing culture dully and unconvincingly put across. It all just comes across as moronic, violent and slightly sordid. The film also fails to show the side of the law with any gravitas, realism or interest, besides the incredulity stirred within me at the sight of a police/FBI headquarters in the form of some mansion equipped with a swimming pool...! The very vagueness of Paul Walker's character and the subplot centering around Diesel's activities, is matched by the equally vague and unconvincing way the police are portrayed.This is a movie with no focus, fascination or indeed, ""fury"" if you will, beyond a facile, faltering nihilism. An assault on the senses it may well be, but it is a rather hollow and unprovoked assault.Rating:- */*****",2.0,Anonymous,Crime

A Fast and Furious movie,"Fast cars. Big engines. Big Egos. High velocity action. Michelle Rodriguez. Definitely one of my favourite films based on these factors. TFATF is a high velocity action packed street-racing movie with a simple plot. the story is clich√© ridden but it works well incorporating the street-racing aspect and its characters into it. Although to film critics the film is just a mindless street racing movie with a back-story that was made to entertain audiences under the age of 25. Though it is true that the movie draws its audience through the street-racing aspect.The film is not a cinematic classic, however it cannot be placed as another Gone in 60 Seconds because the two movies are not the same. Although both centred around high powered cars, their plots are significantly different. The plot of TFATF is simple and clich√© along with some of the dialogue but it delivers on thrills and high intensity stunts. It falls nothing short of hitting the audience with fast cars, sexy women and heart-pounding stunts.The film can appeal to both male and female audiences; sexy women and fast cars for the guys and the motorheads; and the muscle-bound, action-heroism of Vin Diesel for the ladies.Despite the plot somewhat lacking any depth or complexity, the movie is successful in drawing its target audience of under 25's and proves to be a highly entertaining blockbuster smash.6.5/10",6.0,Anonymous,Crime

It hit the spot.,"In contrast to Driven, The Fast and the Furious actually hit the mark it was aiming for.  In fact, I might go so far as to say that it actually surpassed my expectations.  I'm not going to go overboard here and suggest that it is a masterpiece of cinema.  However, it is certainly a cut above the average Hollywood movie.  Firstly, its theme is one of inherent interest.  There is something really quite engaging about the life of a street racer: modifying a run-of-the-mill Japanese compact car into a 500bhp vehicle that can do a quarter-mile in 10 seconds and gathering in the middle of the night with 100 like-minded racers to wager thousands of dollars on quarter-mile drag races.The film had great energy and was just angry enough to give it attitude, but not too angry as to be obnoxious.  The race and chase sequences were excellent; full of high speed action and cool camera angles.  Unfortunately, there were a couple of crashes that people walked away from which, in real life, would have seriously injured those involved.  But apart from the odd departure from real-life, the driving seemed actually pretty accurate.The story and characters were also better than I expected.  There were some tough choices for the hero, Brian (played by the blue-eyed Paul Walker), and you actually felt like you got to know the main players a bit.  Vin Diesel, who plays opposite Walker as the charismatic, if harsh, street racing legend Dominic, has an on-screen presence similar to Ving Rhames.  In fact, it is Diesel who forms the backbone of the film, both within the context of the story and with his performance.In addition to the great races and chases, there are some nice scenesinvolving interaction of the characters.  In particular, a moment towards the end, when Brian reveals his true identity to Dominic, generates a great deal of tension.As with many films of this nature, it would be easy to pick it apart.Dissecting the inconsistencies in the story and illogical decisions of the characters would, however, just be a futile engagement.  This film is more about the experience than the meaning... more about the journey than the destination.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

"The saving grace of 'The Fast and the Furious' are the highly charged racing sequences, but even those are punctured by Rob Cohen's berserk direction","The Fast and the FuriousEvery week, trucks containing valuable electronic equipment are hijacked by the expert drivers of super-fast, unmarked cars. In their investigation, the FBI and the Los Angeles police force begin to suspect participants in the vicious, illegal nighttime street-racing wars of committing the crimes. The almost cult-like following that this activity attracts is led by Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel, 'Pitch Black'), whose more sensible sister Mia (Jordana Brewster, 'The Faculty') is beginning to fall for Brian O'Connor (Paul Walker, 'She's All That'), a new face in the street-racing circuit. But, unbeknownst to Mia or Dominic and his entourage, Brian is an undercover cop who has been assigned to infiltrate their group and try to discover the culprit behind the thefts. But as Brian spends more and more time with the Torettos and their companions, he finds himself torn between his duty as a police officer, and his loyalty as a friend.Aside from the fact that 'The Fast and the Furious' is based on a Vibe magazine article about street-racing written by Ken Li, the script isn't anything special, and seems more heavily inspired by the mediocre Jerry Bruckheimer-produced 'Gone in Sixty Seconds' remake from last year, as well as a 1999 Hong Kong action film, 'The Legend of Speed'. I can forgive the lack of brains presented here, but some actual characters would have been nice, as would capable actors to fill their shoes. Paul Walker does not convince in the lead role, and fails to truly express the emotional byproducts of his character's internal conflict of interests, while Vin Diesel is all too content to let his muscles do the talking. Michelle Rodriguez, as Diesel's moody love interest, is the bright spark within the tedium, but it seems as if she wandered onto the set while filming 'Girlfight' and was instantly hired on the spot. For a mainstream breakthrough, this gifted actress deserved better.The saving grace of 'The Fast and the Furious' are the highly charged racing sequences, but even those are punctured by Rob Cohen's berserk direction.

It works a lot like an exploitation movie, it got enough commentary and character depths to attract attention to it, but it is clearly contrived in a way that is safe and pleasing to anyone reading in whatever way they want. While some of it feels deeper than the surface-level stuff the bigger films in the franchise pull, some of it is shot stylistically to seem like it's saying something to tell the exact opposite. '
Nonetheless, it's an entertaining film that never stops the rush it has and anything added to it just makes it more appealing even if it is safe and half-assed to look more than it is. Vin Diesel was really perfect in this role with all the positives and negatives in the writing of the whole movie itself clearly reflected in the way he carries the role.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
so bad it made me furious,"'The Fast and the Furious' is probably only enjoyable for those cinema-goers who enjoy films about cars and ellaborate chase scenes and for girls who like to see Vin Diesel. This film had nothing going for it whatsoever (unless, of course, you are really into one of those subjects that I just mentioned). The film is all about fast cars and a little bit of crime with 'bad guys/bad girls' image. That sums up the entire film, which leaves little to the imagination and little anything to appreciate.I certainly will not be recommending this film to anyone. Hey, if you like nothing but watching cars race on screen and a little bit of 'bad guy/bad girl' gang life, then I hope you enjoy this. I personally think it is one of the worst movies that I've had the displeasure of seeing.",1.0,Anonymous,Crime
unfair comments,"Hey mate, Ibelieve that everyone is entitled to their opinions but that is harsh, I believe that it was an awesome movie with top actors. When I came out late at night from seeing it, everyone was ommenting on what a good movie it was, including the non-car people.The storyline may have been a little out there, but it was different you know. And I believe that the directors hit the nail on the head with this one as many people saw it and its something that is happening in youth culture today. check out the fast fours forums, this is true to life stuff about the cars and the people, its how young people communicate today.With that said and done I give this movie a 10 out of 10!",,Anonymous,Crime

Awesome Movie..One of my Favourites from collection :),"Awesome Movie.The best of the Fast and furious collection in my opinion.The best thing is watching the whole collection and then returning back to the first one , that is when you really truly appreciate it for what it is..Seeing Paul walker,Vin diesel and all the other actors together really puts a smile on your face. The only thing i honestly didn't like was, there just wasn't enough action, but then again there isn't too much action like the new ones which just drain your life tbh. Such a great movie which focuses on the main idea of bringing family together.If you haven't watched it your missing out and i suggest that you get onto it straightaway..

fast cars go vroom vroom,"Awesome fun entertaining movie with a great story. The story is a lot more intricate than I remember it being and flows very well. Great characters you immediately become attachment to, with strong development of Brian and Dom's characters.Good creative directing with some BEASTLY action scenes. And even tho most people may disagree, I think paul walker gave a good performance, and the other actors played their roles perfectly. The dialogue was pretty weak. Great musical score and song selection for the soundtrack.This movie is one of my favorites and partially a guilty pleasure movie for me. I think it's really good but at the same time there is a lot you can make fun of, i find myself laughing at those parts, because even though they're bad, i still like them.Watching it again, my love for it continues to increase.

The Lame and the Ludicrous,"Where does one begin, coincidentally a dilemma which the director also faced, with considerably less success. I entered this movie with low expectations hoping, vainly, to be surprised. Needless to say it failed to meet even these low expectations. I actually left the cinema, feeling personally insulted that a director could show such contempt for the audience. The acting was uniformally appalling, not in the least part aided by a script that was, quite frankly laughable; 'and if I win, I win the respect.' The actors handled the complexity of human emotions like warring neanderthals; I would be tempted to read into this a brutal misanthropic polemic, though this of course would be crediting the director with far more than he deserves. The very fact that the first hour escaped the cutting room floor is an act of escapology comparable to exploits of Houdini himself. Admittedly, it improved marginally as it progressed, though by this time I was numb, feeling drained, overwhelmed and violated, not least by the almost constant grating noise of screeching engines. Oh yes, and the attempt to get away from crude ethnic stereotypes was... well er absent.In conclusion if the thought of fast cars, vacuous 'ladies' and at least 10 minutes of fascinating dialogue about car engines has you salivating, then this may, I repeat may, be the film for you. If on the other hand you value the more conventional customs of the film industry; plot, characterization, drama, suspense and intrigue, then please, please avoid.*/***** (this is the first film I've ever reviewed as a *!, it really was that bad!)",2.0,Anonymous,Crime
good...but we've seen it already,"I really thought I'd hate this movie but it wasn't at all bad. In fact, I really enjoyed it a lot more than I thought I was going to. Exciting racing,nice cars and not a bad story...buuuuuuut; it's already been done. The story is so close to Point Break that the writers HAD to have noticed it. Point Break is the better of the two,but I still recommend this one. Now for the other bad stuff....(I'd put this under the goofs section,but it's not available yet). 1- The first streetrace we see lasts far longer than a quarter mile race does,which is NEVER over 20 seconds (unless your car is really really slow or broken). Well,this first race was (roughly) 2 minutes in duration. I know it makes for better action,but it's unreasonable all the same. 2- I don't care how powerful your car is. In the final scene of the movie,Dom does a wheelstand WITHOUT doing a burnout (heats the tires for traction) this is impossible (although great eye candy,the car would do nothing but sit there and spin) and 3- Final scene again. Dom's car apparantly was a 9 second vehicle vs the 10 second import and the race ended neck and neck. There is no way they would end that close if the cars truly ran what they said they did. A full second in a race is a huge gap. If there were a couple of tenths difference,that would be different..but a FULL second? That being said....it was a pretty good movie anyway. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
this movie is terrible,there are few pieces of cinema that fail so spectacularly as this does. it's pathetic how bad this movie is. the plot is weakly written and the characters are poorly developed and the dialog is unnatural and awkward. do yourself a favor and stay away. I don't know why the makers of this film decided to go through with production on a movie with such limited appeal. it is without a shadow of a doubt one of the biggest wastes of time and money I've ever seen. all this movie did for me was call into question the quality of the acting ability for all those involved in this bomb. vin diesel is a terrible actor and this movie is bad even by his standards. paul walker as the undercover cop is hard to identify with. many of the roles in this movie are completely unrealistic and lame.,1.0,Anonymous,Crime

The OG and the Best,"I'm never one to write reviews, but this film is one of my favorites for multiple reasons. The 2 main characters of Brian and Dom are just a match made in heaven with Paul Walker and Vin Diesel playing them respectively. Jordana Brewster and Michelle Rodriguez fit perfectly as the love interests and are some of the most badass women I've seen in car films. This film is a timeless classic because of the car chases, the chemistry of the actors, and the greatness of the action displayed with the cars. The directing was really well done for a movie of this scope mixing slow motion in some car sequences with the real time effects of the stunts that the cars are undertaking. The music fits the film well, and it maintains the tone of the film superbly.The original of the fast and furious saga definitely set the bar extremely high for the sequels and luckily some of the sequels have been able to reach and some exceed it.
Most of all this movie is special for me because it was influential in my childhood as it was the first PG-13 movie I ever saw as a child (I was 5) lol.
Just an awesome movie all around. Check it out if you've never seen it before.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Switch off and enjoy,"Far from being the most complex movie out there, the fast and the furious is something you don't have to think in depth about to enjoy, fast paced and easy to follow with big action scenes.I absolutely loved this movie when it came out and would have given it 10/10, of course I was 13 at the time, I'm 35 now and although I still enjoy it I'm no longer obsessed with fast cars.I would advise not letting your teenager go out driving right after watching any of the films, especially Tokyo Drift. Trying to leave the cinema carpark as soon as these films finish is a risk with all the young drivers thinking they're Vin Diesel and Paul Walker, indeed Paul Walker can be used as a cautionary tale.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
What a mess...,"The problem that The Fast and The Furious has is that it is inconsistent. It at times is a police drama, at times a car movie, a gun movie and a romance. As a result, it fails on all counts, and fails spectacularly.The acting is pitiful, but the writing may be worse. There are times where lines are delivered so poorly that the actors seem to have simply given up trying to salvage the train wreck of a script. The attempts at ""street cred"" are embarrassing (""dawg,"") and the film's method of sounding technically proficient is to deliver lines of dialogue that sound like the actors are reading an inventory list at AutoZone.The most frustrating thing about the movie is that it refused to budge from its somewhat complex story line. While nothing brilliant, the story was more developed that a standard action flick's. This is only a problem because the film was absolutely not up to the task. The action was nonsensical, and surprisingly scarce. The movie lacked a true protagonist because everyone was far too annoying to root for. The actors themselves seemed lost; milling around, reading lines.It is important to mention the cars themselves, though, since this is being billed as a `car movie.' And that depends on what is expected from a car movie. If you are hoping for Camaro SSs and Hemi Cudas, you will be disappointed. If you are looking for Acuras and Hondas, you'll see them. If you're looking for Ronin-style car chases or Blues Brothers silliness, you'll be disappointed. If you want to see tiny cars driving in straight lines in fifteen-second bursts, you'll see it.In the end, the only thing I found at all satisfying was the romance aspect of the movie, which the furthest thing from my mind when I bought my ticket. If I were Vin Diesel, I would have taken one look at the script and one look at my cast mates and then I would have stolen one of their souped up jalopies and hightailed it back to a real movie career.",2.0,Anonymous,Crime

Somehow this is the most grounded entry in the franchise.,"A friend who hasn't seen them wants to go through all the films together. We're one film in and I'm half regretting it and half strapped in for the ride. I've only seen up to 7 before, but the trailers for the films past that are incredible in their own way.This one was actually ok, it made me nostalgic for PS1 games even though I never had that console.There were some surprisingly real human moments and neat stunts spread throughout the film, but the overall experience was marred by some bad CGI, weird NOS logic, and a 10 second drag race that actually had a screen time of two minutes. This isn't anime. I think I have yet to see a drag race on film that's interesting. Isn't most of the fun in the prep?Regardless, I'm kind of shocked that this became a series that's still running (probably on gas by this point) 22 years later, with it's eleventh entry.

Ordinary-Person oriented-each ticket with a complimentary grain of salt,"This film was a strategically marketed film with a simple idea in mind-sell one ticket to every 18-24 year old male in America. It adapted a simple idea of an ""underground,"" a sub-culture which the majority of persons are not entirely aware of. That was a good idea in and of itself. Allowing the average person a glimpse into an unknown, yet fascinating, world makes for excellent marketing. The more guns, drugs, and cops, the better.Neil Moritz chose to not get picky with details. Well done. Rather, he saw the movie through the demographic's eye. For the most part, we don;t care about cheesy effects and run-ons, as long as the movie keeps it's promise: lots of action with few details. It did.For the car-fanatics out there, myself included, there's a bakers dozen and a half of errors. Who cares?

Kudos to Vin Diesel, who was the best part of ""Boiler Room"" and shows his acting chops here with little to work with.

The name says all,"A few months ago this film burst onto U.S. screens with little or no build up, and became a huge success.With a virtually unknown cast and competition from movies such as Dr Dolittle 2, it made a large impact on the box office, reaching number one.As for the product itself, I was pleasantly surprised with the quality. The movie opens with a spectacular truck hijacking by a group of black high performance cars. The plot then follows the story of Brian, played by little-known Paul Walker, a young car parts salesman who is trying to ingratiate himself into a group of revheads in L.A. After initial resistance, he becomes the protege of their leader Dom, played by Vin Diesel, a minor celebrity actor whose biggest roles were in Pitch Black and Saving Private Ryan.The big letdown is the close similarity between the story and the movie Point Break, except the activity of surfing is replaced by street racing. Paul Walker is certainly no Keanu Reeves, but he doesn't have to be - the cars are the real items of interest in this movie.It happens that Brian is actually an undercover cop, intent on finding the hijackers. He must first prove himself to be a legitimately talented racer as his cover identity. Naturally there's the obligatory love interest for Brian provided by Dom's little sister.The stunts are extremely well staged, almost to the point of believing that they must be computer generated pictures.The races and car chases are totally exhilarating, such that you don't have time to pick holes in the plot or worry about the quality (or lack of) the acting or script.The soundtrack is completely occupied by either cars revving or full force rap/techno music - under no circumstances see this movie with a pre-existing headache - it will be 50 times worse afterwards! That said, I think the sound is wholly appropriate to this film.Make sure you stay until after the closing credits, because it's one of those movies where there's something more for the viewer.Sit back, relax, and enjoy the spectacle.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

It was sold out, but we got into the 12:15am show time and the theater was packed! AT 12:15!! I don't understand what the appeal of this movie is. A bunch of fast cars? Fast cars does not a good movie make.The dialogue of this movie was terrible. There wasn't anything interesting said the whole time.  My friends (who LOVED the movie) tried to defend it saying that they talked like real people talk. Well, if I want to see real people talk I'll go to the barber shop or something; somewhere where I don't have to pay $8.25. Such lines as ""It doesn't matter if you win by an inch or a mile, winning is winning."" and ""I'll have the tuna fish,"" are the most memorable, and believe me they really sucked.The plot hardly got in the way of the blatant attempt to make a movie just for the reason of a bunch of cars going really fast. And audiences couldn't WAIT to see a bunch of cars going really fast. Maybe these people should watch NASCAR or something, then they won't have to worry about ignoring some piddly plot. If you want to see a GOOD movie with cars see Bullitt.Who hired these actors? ALL of them were terrible especially Vin Diesel who sleeps through the movie. My guess is they spent so much money on the cars that they could only afford to hire fifth rate actors.I gave this movie a 2 out of 10.

Cars like Toyota Supra, Honda Civic and American classic Charger. It is nice treat for all car lovers. When you hear that engine sound and that NOS boost you just wanna get there and race. Racing and chasing is pretty much realistic. But movie is not all about racing it gives connection between main characters that will last trough other movies. It is very underrated movie.

Unfortunately the story has already been done- replace the racers with surfers, the trucks with banks, Vin Diesel with Patrick Swayze and voila, you have Point Break.

Mildly entertaining stuff for teenagers ¬ñ hardly exciting or dramatic enough,"A gang of drivers are pulling off high speed hijacks of trucks and stealing their cargo.  Undercover cop Brian O'Conner is sent in to infiltrate one of the numerous street racing crews who are suspected of the crime.  He wins over Dominic Toretto, the head of one such crew and begins his investigation.  However the closer he gets to the crew and the more he gets into the culture, the harder it is to do his job.One weekend I was considering going to see 2 Fast 2 Furious but decided to go and rent the first movie before I see the sequel or else how would I be able to follow the plot and characters (oh ¬ñ how optimistic I was!).  So I rented this film knowing that it had received better reviews than the sequel.  I expected stylish thrills and exciting high speed action with a weak plot ¬ñ I was half right.  The plot was pretty weak and full of clich√©s ¬ñ from the `going native undercover cop' to the `urban' lingo that everyone tries to speak in.It doesn't really make much sense and it is a pretty fragile house of cards that comes crashing down logic-wise if you ask too many questions.  However, to focus on the plot here is wasting my time and yours, as it matters little ¬ñ this is an action movie, not a drama.  I expected the action to be slick and breathless given the speeds involved however I was really disappointed. Aside from a few directorial flourishes that make it all appear much more exciting than it is, the car action is actually quite normal.  Even the climatic hijacking is done with no feeling of `edge of seat thrills' although it looks impressive.  I'm sure many will be taken in by the sheer slickness of the thing, but I found the action to be soulless and lacking in any real excitement.The cast are a line of urban clich√©s who sound like every suburban teenager in the Western world tries to sound. Walker is bland and manages to make Vin Diesel look like he's acting hard.  In fairness Diesel was responsible for the only scene I found dramatic (where Toretto finds out who O'Conner is) by doing good work with his face ¬ñ but for the rest he was simply a tough guy lacking in the charisma needed to do a likeable bad guy.  Rodriguez looks good but is better than this.  Brewster is surprisingly plain given the amount of eye candy on display and the rest of the support cast simply mug (Ja Rule included).  More often I found myself watching the crowds who were populated with beautiful girls who were cynically edited in at every chance to try and get the teenage boys coming back for more.  I'm not complaining, but it is hard not to feel a little exploited when the film has a lingering shot of two gorgeous girls snogging for no reason other than visual titillation.Overall, like the cars themselves this is a very slick vehicle but I found it to be ultimately empty and soulless.  The plot is meaningless and the script one clich√© after another.  The action scenes are ordinary and it is a major failing of the film that it doesn't manage to translate the thrill of 140 mph races etc onto the screen.  If you want to see a road race done better I suggest an exciting scene in the Jackie Chan 1995 film `Pi li ho' ¬ñ that I found exciting, this I just found to be hollow and noisy.",,Anonymous,Crime
Don't expect too much but incredible speed and you won't be disappointed,"I must confess to actually reather enjoying the film; whilst there was little in the way of plot, the actors are no better or worse than the majority of the Hollywood lot these days. The cars were awesome (as the owner of a MKIII Supra I enjoyed that aspect) and the sound and ethos was very immersive, but there wasn't a huge amount of intelligent dialogue. The actors weren't bad - the characters just weren't overly deep.That said, ask yourself why you watched the film. Was it for the undercover cop story, admittedly done a thousand times? Or was it to see THOSE CARS move? I think that that last, as the films focus, was done incredibly well, and the actors did a good job of being the varied and individual if somewhat cliched drivers, which is essentially what they were there for. I liked the story, but then I tend to like almost all stories, I'm very open minded.This leaves me to say one thing...I'm not THAT much of a car person, but after seeing this...I WANT MY CAR TO DO THAT!",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

If you closed your eyes and just listened to the movie, you would probably be driven to lay yourself in the path of one of these cars because the dialogue and acting was so God awful. But if you were to do the opposite, meaning close your ears and just watch, you would have been privy to a marvelous treat. I found it very telling about the pulse of the American public when ""The Fast and Furious"" pulled in a lot of dough while Stallone's ""Driven"" did poorly. One point for the street racers: zero for the pros.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Bad.,"This is a bad movie...As someone who has enjoyed motorsports for several years, both as participating and watching, I found this movie to be offensive.

One of a kind of the series,"There's a good love story wrapped around the manifolds and superchargers.Its about a series of truck high-jacks has brought in a squad of undercover cops to deal with the problem and they do so by sending Officer Brian Earl Spilner (real name Brian O'Conner) (Paul Walker) to infiltrate the number one racing clan. It's led by Dominic ""Dom"" Toretto (Vin Diesel), the fastest and strongest among 'em. O'Conner starts his quest by demonstrating his hangup with speedy metal, then by hanging around Dom's bar, which Dom's sister Mia (Jordana Brewster) runs and bartends. In the course of events he loses his ride, saves Dom's life and some embarrassment, hooks up with Mia, and learns to respect Dom in ways he never expected.The racing sequences are brought off with considerable energy and as an expression of this culture but are weakened by a plot device contrived to give the races and the racers a dynamic advantage. The movie had a decent plot but the writing and dialogue was poor. Many people consider the first one the best of the series and I agree with them on some levels. Though had the writing and dialogue been better, this film would have been much better. Also they could have used better character development and better acting. Its a film centered at a specific group. Meaning not for everyone. As a rewatch 06/03/19', the original Fast and the Furious shows how everything was set up. A solid debut and shows the early stages of how this become a dynasty in the making.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
A sexist racist pile of poop,"Oh dear.Where do we start?Let's ignore the fact that this film was poorly plotted, poorly scripted, badly conceived and reminiscent of the tackiest MTV video you can think of. Let's remain blissfully unaware of the production values that would make yesterdays breakfast look like a five course dinner. Let's also overlook the poorest acting I've seen from young Hollywood ""talent"" since Sunset Beach.Yes, lets.Okay, onto the REALLY objectionable stuff...Firstly, the only oriental characters involved are not only street punk goons but also the primary bad guys. Okay, so the main goon's dad is in it too for about five seconds and isn't very happy at his sons conduct, but this is hardly an excuse to have such a racially imbalanced plotline. This is the 21st century and this cowboys and indians style concept is worthy of a prison sentence, particulary as it comes from a country where racial equality is considered to be a key issue.Secondly, we see lots and lots of cars and... guess what? Oh yes, women wearing next to nothing running around allowing their drivers to fondle their ""assets"", then offering threesomes. Despite the fact that the realisim factor is minute - surely most women would despair of a guy who's life revolved around his car - it also portrays an image of women as mere sex objects to pleasure guys in fast cars. Again, we have one token female who is a racer, but this hardly makes this kind of imagery morally sound, and the camera still takes time to wander over her person with an almost feral attention to detail.By portraying these women as trophies, it suggests that irresponsible behaviour such as street racing can earn you sexual favours. This is of course complete rubbish in the case of nearly every single woman with an IQ above 0.2.Finally, I would just like to point out that the entire plot and premise of the film displays a complete lack of belief in safe, responsible driving. Not a single seatbelt is seen throughout the entire film, people have horrific accidents in their cars then stroll out completely unscathed, and not once did I see a crash helmet or protective clothing except on the ""oriental bad guy goons"". What sort of message is that sending out to our 13 and 15 year olds as they begin to reach the age where they can legally drive?To sum it up, this is a meathead movie, made for meatheads by meatheads.

Improbably cool.,"On one level, ""The Fast and the Furious"" is two hours of machismo. But on another level, it does show the subculture of street racing. Before it came out, I'd never known that people soup their cars up with nitrous oxide to increase speed. Vin Diesel plays his typical role, and Paul Walker almost seems like a side character.I should identify that much of the movie looks pretty improbable. I won't divulge the scenes right here for risk of spoiling the movie, but trust me: you'll know these scenes when you see them. But like I said, the movie does give one an insight into the world of street racing.

I love racing. Action, and lambriginie cars. This movie has it all. Dom is fast and strong. Vin deasel was perfect for the role. Same with Brian O. Coner. I thought him and Mia were gonna get married but they didn't. It also had a lot of hot girls. They always do. But I was surprised it was rated PG 13. I thought it should've been because of the profanity. But it was great anyway. But the film wasn't really about Dom. Mostly about Brian. If this wasn't good the furious series never would've started. Even though it's just Action for action, it was entertaining. Also, I learned a lesson from this movie.

Rob Cohen reinvents the Hod Rod Movie,"Like costars Vin Diesel and Michelle Rodriguez, `The Fast and the Furious' is sleek, sexy, all attitude and dubious morality.  Expect no surprises from the thin script, just hot metal, great tunes, flash and pizzaz.  Paul Walker is the GQ-Pretty Anglo love interest.  Jordan Brewster plays Diesel's baby sister.  Both are pros, but they pale against the impact of Diesel and Rodriguez.  Also of special note are Giovanni Ribisi-clone Chad Lindbert as Jesse and Matt Schulze as Vince, Diesel's childhood buddy and Walker's rival for Brewster.If you have ANY affection for 50s hot rod movies, see this one.

Rehash Of Point Break With Street Racers Instead Of Surfers,"I had never actually seen this movie. I had seen most of the second one (I found it OK) watched the third one (was bored to tears) and I lost interest in the franchise before I was dragged to see the 6th movie, which despite not knowing a lot of character development, I enjoyed.However prior to the 7th movie being released, SkyMovies are showing all the movies, so I decided to see what I had missed out on!!Plot In A Paragraph: LA street racer Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) falls under the suspicion of the LAPD for a string of high-speed electronics truck robberies. Brian O'Connor (Paul Walker) an officer of the LAPD, joins the ranks of Toretto's highly skilled racing crew undercover to convict Toretto. However, O'Connor finds himself both enamored with this new world and in love with Toretto's sister, Mia (Jordana Brewster) As a rival racing crew gains strength, O'Connor must decide where his loyalties really lie.Although essentially ""Point Break"" with street racers instead of surfers, this is easily the best movie of the franchise (of the movies I have seen) not surprising with it being the first (they usually the best) As with ""Point Break"" the villain (Patrick Swayze in ""Point Break"") is much more interesting than the hero. Vin Diesel has charisma in spades, Paul Walker is likable and an attractive enough lead, Michelle Rodriguez is tough and sexy whilst Jordana Brewster is absolutely gorgeous.The racing scenes and action set pieces are well directed, the dialogue is a bit weak and clich√© at times but overall this is a lot of fun.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
what the hell was that?!,"I'll tell you what ... THE worst movie ever made.  I can't even believe I paid the $5 to rent this piece of DVD-Trash and I feel even worse for those who paid much more to see it in the theatre.Where to begin, where to begin.  Why not start with the plot, since people here keep saying it doesn't matter.  Okay okay, so there actually was no plot, but that's not going to stop me from ranting.  This movie had no focus or direction.  In the beginning it's this kid wanting to be a street racer. Then he's a cop trying to stop an electronics theft ring. Then it's some half baked attempt at a love story ala Romeo & Juliet with the kid and the family who doesn't accept him. Then it's a story about ripping off some truck.  Oh ya, and the occasional car race.  And as if that couldn't get any better, this movie even comes complete with an evil Chinese syndicate(could we get any more stereotypical????).I guess I should talk about the cast now.  Um ... ya, what an amazing cast of stellar bad-actors.  Yeesh!  Although I suppose it's not all their fault (well, except for Vin Diesel), most of the blame belongs to the awful script and terrible dialogue.  I watched Jordana Brewster for 3 years on As The World Turns, she's a good actress.  She was great over on ATWT.  But here... the height of her performance is the frequent use of ""Stop the bulls&@% !!!!"".  Paul Walker, he may be good, he may not be.  You can hardly judge by this movie and I havent seen him in anything else.  To me, it seemed like a classic case of casting based upon looks.Speaking of bad dialogue.  The absolute worst element in this movie was all the male ego BS.  The worst example of this was the ending scene with Paul Walker and Vin Diesel.  Paul Walker's character, the cop (just thought I'd reiterate this) was chasing down Vin Diesel's character in one of the movie's few car chases.  Diesel's car is smashed into by a truck and the car's totaled.  Walker pulls his gun on him and looks like he's going to do his job and arrest him.  But what does he do?  Hands him the keys to his car and says ""I still owe you a 60 second car"" and lets him ride off.  Then the movie ends.  Hopefully, what we didn't see was Walker's character suspended from the force, followed by a hearing, followed by an arrest and sentencing for Aiding and Abetting.Now this wouldn't be a good review if I didn't mention the car stuff. Firstly I found it extremely annoying that this movie threw in so much car gibberish that the average movie goer like myself had absolutely no clue what was being said.  Second, the car stunts were few and extremely lacking in excitement.  How exciting is it to see a car go in a straight line?  Not very.  How exciting is it to see 5 cars try and rob an 18 Wheeler?  It probably was, but by that point in the movie I simply didn't care.  And also... if the truck driver is shooting at you with a rifle ... why are you still chasing him?  To save some redneck who most of the characters don't seem to like, and end up killing two of the people you do like?I could go on and on about the flaws and annoyances of this movie ... but I don't have the time.  I like action movies ... when they're GOOD.  But this was not good, not by a long shot.",1.0,Anonymous,Crime

The best races on the streets,"This movie shows what people mad about racing cars can make. It's absolutely awesome that any of those cars can reach such high speed in the streets of an American big city. This is due to the good quality of the asphalt and the skills of the drivers. One thing that impressed me was the Detroit-made car driven by Toretto.America looks like an awesome country.Dominic Toretto is an American car builder who has the reputation of being the best at everything that has something to do with gasoline. And Vin Diesel carries out his task with an awesome performance.Paul Walker is another great American actor, very handsome, who plays a good-guy who is loyal first and foremost to his buddies.

"Stay 'til the very end, after the credits roll, for the conclusive ending","I wouldn't call this 'trashy' goods. It's a perfectly good Hollywood script. Besides the car 'dueling' action sequences, it includes energy of the younger set (20 something's), the eagerness to experience risks, and the plight to feel the spirit of freedom - even if it's a matter of moments. Death is not an ominous worry to them. They live for the moment.Paul Walker is in the lead role of Brian, the undercover LA cop. He has worked with director Rob Cohen before in ""The Skulls"" 2000. Rob Cohen directed the ""Dragon: The Bruce Lee Story"" 1993 with Jason Scott Lee and Lauren Holly. Also ""Dragonheart"" 1993, a fable of a legend with Sean Connery doing voice of the Dragon which Dennis Quaid gallantly duels with. Cohen's movies may be Hollywood, yet they tend to have a backbone ethical/living outlook that prompts the integrity of the central character(s).Vin Diesel is Dominic, the rebellious one here - can past as James Dean, the leader whom the gang looks up to. He stood out in ""Boiler Room"" 2000, opposite Giovanni Ribisi, and was the only good thing in ""Pitch Black"" 2000, the sci-fi flick which he was the lead opposite Radha Mitchell (from ""High Art"" 1998 opposite Ally Sheedy.)Jordana Brewster was last seen as the furiously grieving sister of Cameron Diaz in ""The Invisible Circus"" playing opposite Christopher Eccleston (who's in ""Gone in 60 Seconds,"" another fast cars and chase flick). Brewster is Dominic's feisty sister Mia, furiously sulky here besides having a chance to be fast (driving, matching up to the testosterone bunch.) Michelle Rodriguez is Dominic's woman, full of anger within, charged with a devil may care defiance. The role of Johnny by Rick Yune has a flavor of Giovanni Ribisi's energy as in ""Gone in 60 Seconds."" But Cohen's ""The Fast and the Furious"" is comparably more substantial and colorful in storyline and character development, even comes with a 'dream' quote for the fast and the furious: ""I live my life quarter of a mile per second at a time¬Önothing else matters¬Öin those 10 seconds, I'm free."" And the backbone that held together the friendship between Walker and Diesel's characters is soundly strong.Be sure to stay on to the very end of the movie - after all the credits roll, Vin Diesel and Paul Walker you'll see, and you get to hear Dominic's quote once again (besides receiving a satisfying closure to the story.)",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

"The Fast and the Furious (2001) - Vin Diesel and Paul Walker, Start Your Engines!","Known as the first film in the ""Fast and the Furious"" series, this thrilling street-racing action flick brought a start to a daring and explosive franchise. Paul Walker plays LAPD officer Brian O' Connor, who is sent undercover to investigate a gang of street-racers, all portrayed by Vin Diesel as Dominic Toretto, Jordana Brewster as his sister Mia, and Michelle Rodriguez as his girlfriend Letty. But then, he starts having feelings for this particular group, and has no idea whether to bust them or not. This really is a thrilling, and exciting film. Who doesn't enjoy watching car races, hot ladies, and rocking music? The race scenes are exciting and fun, and they steal the whole movie. But I don't really think this movie should be called an ""excellent"" movie, but instead a ""cool"" movie. Vin Diesel and Paul Walker are two of the toughest guys ever seen on film, so it was really fun watching them racing cars, shooting guns, and beat up people. But neither one of them gives a special performance. The story may sound like a crazy concept, but it is original. It's neither a remake or a reboot of classic car race films. Anyways, if you're interested in watching a classic movie with chase scenes, hot ladies, explosive bombs, and tons of violence, you won't be disappointed.

Turn Off the Brain and Enjoy,"The Fast and the Furious (2001)*** (out of 4)Brainless but entertaining action film about cop Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker) who goes undercover to get inside the street racing crowd so that he can try to bring down a group hijacking semi trucks. He gets in good with Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) and his crew but of course they don't know his true identity. THE FAST AND THE FURIOUS isn't to be taken serious because if you did then you'd see one flaw after another in regards to the story itself. Like a lot of summer blockbusters, this one here has had way too many Red Bulls as every single scene is just over-the-top and has some testosterone going overboard. That's not to say this is a bad thing because there's no question that the film remains entertaining as a pure action movie as we're given some likable characters as well as some great racing scenes. I think most people are going to be coming to this thing for the fast cars and the various chases and this here is where the film won't let you down. There are some terrific stunt sequences, although I will admit that a few of them appear to be too much CGI and not enough actual driving. With that said, there are some great ones here including the ending, which I won't spoil here. It also doesn't hurt that we're given some characters that we can like even if I think the screenplay doesn't do a couple of them justice. Both Walker and Diesel are very believable in their roles as is Michelle Rodriquez, Jordana Brewster and even Ted Levine in his role. I will say at times it's somewhat hard to root for the main guys even though we do like this. This is especially true during the final sequence when the truck is being hijacked. Still, THE FAST AND THE FURIOUS is a fun ride as long as you don't expect some serious piece of art.",,Anonymous,Crime

Not Great But Solid,"Fast and the Furious franchise is one of the best examples of vicarious entertainment in the movie industry. Anyone who likes action, nice cars, racing, women etc. will find enjoyment from this movie and this franchise in one way or another. This film is a basic popcorn flic. There is not deep plot or deep characters here. So people looking for those elements in this film will be disappointed. However, most people probably knew not to expect such elements from a movie like this anyway, from the title to the trailers. I knew what I was getting when I watched this. So I enjoyed this film alright.The story isn't the most original. It's essentially Point Break, but admittedly done better, in my opinion. The characters are not great, though the characters are not what people are looking for in this movie anyway. The film stars Brian O'Conner, played by Paul Walker (RIP), who is an FBI agent. Paul Walker does fine overall in the film. His character I rooted for. However, I do not by for one second that this guy is an FBI agent. Nothing about his character makes be believe he would qualify for the FBI. When he tries to sound professional, it's not believable.Vin Diesel does good in the film as well. I am a fan of Vin Diesel as an actor. He is one of my favorite aspects of the film. Michelle Rodriguez is also in the film, but does not have that much to do. The side cast is fine. I did not really care for them, but I never found them annoying.The action and racing is the highlight of the film and it's done well. The races are fun, and the action (mainly car chases) will have you at the edge of your seat.Overall, I enjoyed the film. It's not a deep movie, but it's not supposed to be. It's a popcorn flick meant to appeal to guys, and especially teenage guys. That's why I call it vicarious entertainment. Every guy secretly dreams about being an action hero, driving a nice car, getting all the women. So many guys secretly would envision themselves as Paul Walker or Vin Diesel's character, or one of the other character in the film. That's why I say this is vicarious entertainment.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime

begins well then careens downhill,"In its early stages, `The Fast and the Furious' offers promise that it will become a kind of street-smart, urban version of `American Graffiti' for the new millennium.  It is, alas, a promise that goes largely unfulfilled when the film decides to go the `Donnie Brasco' route instead (although this ain't no `Donnie Brasco').  Like `American Graffiti,' this movie peers into a culture centered largely around automobiles ¬ñ although in this case it involves high-speed street racing rather than mere cruising.  Unlike Lucas' classic, however, `The Fast and the Furious' betrays its milieu by incorporating a trite tale of an undercover cop (cherubic, squeaky-clean Paul Walker) sent in to infiltrate the cruisers led by Vin Diesel, who appear to be running an elaborate, but actually rather incredible and impracticable, truck hijacking business.  Thus, we are left to endure the inevitable moral conflicts that arise when the cop falls in love with the leader's sister and he begins to feel `sympathy' for the man he is supposed to betray.We could forgive the fact that the dialogue is incredibly inane and the characterizations nonexistent if the film had at least stayed true to its first 40 minutes of nonstop action.  Director Rob Cohen brings a real style and feeling for visual composition to these early scenes, punctuated by incredible stunt work and lightning-paced editing.  The film also captures the feel of urban street rhythms in its musical soundtrack (although you may feel somewhat assaulted by all the visual and aural over-stimulation if you happen to be 25 years of age or older).  In fact, if `The Fast and the Furious' had stayed in this mode throughout, it might even have become an epochal film for the teens of its era.  In this early part, the film's characters pose and strut and drip attitude in a way that becomes emblematic of the trendy youth culture of the time.  Instead, the film becomes just another trite police melodrama straight off the film-factory assembly line.That's really a shame because the stunt work is phenomenal throughout, and Vin Diesel conveys a kind of raw animal magnetism that bodes well for his future in action cinema.  He has a way of commanding the audience's attention every time he makes an appearance on screen.  The cars too are spectacular, although they are so overloaded with computer gizmos and jet propulsion devices that one begins to wonder if NASA itself didn't design and build them.Had it been willing to forego the standard plot mechanics and been content to afford us a glimpse into the life of the street-racing culture, `The Fast and the Furious' might have ended up as a `classic' of youth action cinema. Instead, it becomes just another dumb movie with some really neat car chases.",,Anonymous,Crime
Awesome classic!,"This one is by far the best film of the franchise. Filled with countless tuned Japanese import cars, fast car races and chases. Introduced all the main characters that we know and love in the other films.This film came out when I was in high school and started my love for cars. Even today the Toyota Supra 2JZ is the best car ever made in my opinion. Just an awesome film to watch especially if your into cars.

"Stupid, stupider, stupidest, duhhhhhhh.","Some movies drop clues (albeit small) that allow you to believe, even in retrospect, that you could have ""solved the crime.""  Even if this movie is more concerned with the milieu of this racing society and the relationships among the characters, it needs logical plot development.  The fact that it doesn't have it aside, perhaps, from the ""revelation"" that the ""team"" must be getting all that money SOMEWHERE (something that could be said about just about every ""team"" out there), is the major weakness of the film.  In fact, one senses the only reason the guilty party IS the guilty party is because the writers sat around drinking a little too much Corona and decided, in their drunken state, that it would be cool to have those people be guilty...of course because it would maximally affect one particular relationship...which, of course, leads to the huge cop-out of an ending. Teens across the country will be declaring that this movie is ""true"" and ""real"" - I guess because it puts relationships and ""honesty"" within relationships above everything else.

Yes those aforementioned elements are addressed much to the appreciation of the film's target audience I'm sure but Vin Disel and especially Paul Walker's charisma made their characters very interesting and even sympathetic. I actually cared about their fates. The rest of the supporting cast also complemented the leads nicely, especially Rick Yune (Die Another Day).

Fast-Paced Action and Drama,"Set in Los Angeles, this movie focuses on a team of thieves who hijack trucks operating a high speeds from optimally powered race cars. The cargo is then taken and sold on the black market. Needless to say, the FBI and local authorities are anxious to capture and prosecute these criminals before the truckers take matters into their own hands. To help them on this case a young police officer by the name of ""Brian O'Conner"" (Paul Walker) volunteers to go undercover and infiltrate the most high-profile illegal street racing team in the area which is led by a man named ""Dominic Toretto"" (Vin Diesel) who also has a prison record for violence due to his explosive temper. However, in order to investigate this case Brian first has to get inside this close-knit team and that is more difficult than anybody realizes. Additionally, this particular team is but one of many and it might not be the one responsible. But one thing is sure-action needs to be taken soon before violence erupts on the highways. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this film has enough fast-paced action and drama to satisfy most fans of the genre. No doubt about it. On a more critical note though, I thought that some of the characters-most notably ""Letty"" (Michelle Rodriguez), ""Vince"" (Matt Schulze) and ""Hector"" (Noel Gugliemi)--were much too pretentious and almost to the point of being downright annoying. Likewise, some of the previously mentioned action scenes were more than a little unrealistic as well. But that's Hollywood for you. In any case, from what I understand this film has turned into a profitable enterprise for Universal Pictures and since nothing succeeds like success has bred numerous sequels in its wake. That said, despite the flaws just mentioned I enjoyed this movie and I have rated it accordingly. Slightly above average.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime

"A good, fun movie, but nothing more","I am not a car person.  I try to be, but I'm sadly am not.  All of my friends are (or at least most of them) but it's something I never fell into as a kid.  Movies are my thing, not cars.  So, here I am, review The Fast and the Furious, and guess what? I loved it.I love a good car chase.  Nothing in this world can impress me more than a good car chase.  To this day, RONIN still has the best chases (with maybe the Blues Brothers coming in second), but The Fast and the Furious makes a valiant effort.  Okay, TFATF has a plot recycled from Point Break (which is justt slightly a better movie).  Sure, the car chases will inspire teens to drive like stampeding cows.  But, this is the best dumb movie of the summer.Tomb Raider was stupid beyond belief.  Pearl Harbor was like a dumb blond, she looks good but we all no there is no brain in her head.  The Mummy Returns was just one long action sequence with bad special effects. Swordfish tried to be smart (and was, for the most part).  But the Fast and the furious knows that it isn't the smartest girl at the ball, and it admits it.  This movie is about cars, babes, and, ummm, more cars.Yea, all of the cars are rice burning Hondas or Mitshubishis.  There is ONE Volkswagon though...So, it's not too bright, but it's fun.

Even Jordana Brewster (Mia Torreto) who started off in a horror called The Faculty (1998). This flick had so many technical aspects that people who are tuning their cars will get a tuned hard-on from watching this flick. But for me, I wasn't really attracted towards the story. Paul Walker (Brian O'Connor) did well and in fact it's all about him.

Speed Rush,"Rob Cohen's ""Fast and Furious"" is just that: an adrenaline and speed rush, very derivative, not original, though effective overall. Cohen accomplishes this with the given material, by using intensity, pacing, hard driving music, and casting high power, young actors in the movie, in particular Vin Diesel, Paul Walker, and Rick Yune. F&F is the kind of movie that may not be memorable for it's dramatic content and narrative style, rather as a breakthrough vehicle for its stars. On that basis, the movie has merit. Director Cohen definitely performs some of the most amazing car sequences on screen. The driving stunts rule.Brian (Walker) is an undercover cop investigating a ring of high speed car thieves. While undercover Brian befriends Dom Toretto (Diesel), a powerful street racer with a dark past, who has a sense of honor and loyalty. Dom's rival is a cold blooded leader of an Asian gang, Johnny Tran (Yune). All movie leads shine. Vin Diesel has a commanding physical screen presence. He powers Dom's character with an edge and sense of danger. Diesel will be a huge action star-- he's got the physique and is a good actor. Walker has the leading man good-looks, and attitude. He is well matched as Diesel's foil. He does well with the trite undercover cop storyline of falling in love with the suspect's (Dom's) sister. Rick Yune gives Johnny Tran a dangerous air-- a man of few words and an icy killer. It's always encouraging when a movie has both strong and charismatic heroes and villains. It is all about being cool and looking good-- and ""Fast and Furious"" does this with style and without significance. That is a good thing...",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Weak story, but heart stopping action","This film examines the street racing subculture and provides ample thrills for the 25 and under set.  Based on the box office numbers this film threw up, every teenager in the U.S. must have seen it at least twice, since it doesn't have much appeal outside that demographic.The screenplay pretends to be a detective story about an undercover cop Brian O'Connor (Paul Walker) who infiltrates the street racing scene to try to find a group thieves that has been hijacking tractor trailers and stealing the cargo.  Make no mistake about it.  This is not a detective story.  This is a racing story replete with fast, NOS guzzling street machines, horsed up to burn rubber and detailed to attract babes.  Fasten your seatbelt for a screaming ride to testosterone city.The script panders shamelessly to post pubescent boys with hormone overload. Universal wisely kept it PG-13 to maximize the film's target audience. There is plenty of strutting, getting in people's faces, muscle flexing and a street fight about every fifteen minutes.  Everyone demands respect and if they don't get it there is either a brawl or a race.  Director Rob Cohen, who cut his directorial teeth on `Miami Vice', has an implicit understanding of what makes male movies work and he pulls out all the stops in this film.Unfortunately, Cohen gets so immersed in the street culture that he recklessly reinforces antisocial conduct as normative.  The film sends a consistent message that honor and loyalty to one's friends are more important than the obeying the law.  The police are portrayed as jerks and fools.  The only way to handle injustice is to take matters into your own hands.  You stick up for your friends even if they are criminals and you are a cop.  If another cop disrespects one of your undercover friends, you slug him.  While this might be an accurate reflection of the culture, I feel compelled to interject that the movie industry has a social responsibility to teach our youth good lessons rather than bolster countercultural behavior in the name of realism.Once you get past the script, the film gets extraordinarily high technical marks for the action photography and stunts.  The cars are first rate. Most of the ones seen at the race wars were owned by actual street racers who brought their cars from everywhere to be in the film.  The film has so much adrenaline pumping action that by the time it is finished you need oxygen and a yoga session to settle yourself down.  I can't ever remember a film that had so many cars going airborne.  There is more molten, smoking rubber in this film than in a Perelli manufacturing plant.  The final stunt where the cars are racing to beat the train across the railroad crossing is an awesome, heart-stopping thrill ride.  It is easy to see why kids flocked to this film.The most notable member of the cast is Paul Walker (The Skulls, Pleasantville) who steps up to the lead for the first time.  In the featurette included with the DVD, Rob Cohen declares Walker a modern day Steve McQueen.  I'm afraid not.  McQueen, who saw his heyday in the 1950's and 60's, was a swaggering, audacious male lead brimming with machismo and frequently compared to Paul Newman (who was the star in `Somebody Up There Likes Me', the first film in which McQueen appeared).  Walker is a pussycat by comparison.  If Walker were to be compared to anyone of that generation it would be Troy Donohue, the good looking heart throb of the 1960's. Donohue wasn't extremely dynamic, but the camera loved him, and so did the teenage girls.  Walker fits comfortably into that description.If there is one standout in the film it is Vin Diesel as Dominic.  Diesel carries every scene in which he appears with a pure and imposing power that is present whether he is scrapping or just standing there.  He is mostly tough, but in the scene where he tells Brian about his father, he shows that he can conjure up a vulnerable side.  He presents his character in a way that is both charismatic and complex, part villain and part hero.  No one else in this cast is anywhere near Diesel's league as an actor.Jordana Brewster shows some promise as Dominic's sister and Brian's love interest.  Rick Yune, whose performance I enjoyed in `Snow Falling on Cedars', is menacing and believable as the leader of the Asian gang.This film has a limited audience, but is well done for its target market. I rated it a 7/10 on the strength of the action and stunts.  The story is about a 2/10, but the racing and chase scenes are as good as it gets.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

The car's the star in this mediocre effort,"THE FAST AND THE FURIOUS **Action aficionados look out, because if you want a movie with limited plot to get in the way of some rip roaring cars then this is the film for you. Succinctly put, Paul Walker plays a cop who has to go undercover to infiltrate a gang of illegal car racers and must get into their circle of friends to find out their illegal activities.  Diesel is the leader of such a group and together they become friends.  A moral dilemma story; I think not.  What you get is an excuse to see the fastest turbo boosted cars on the market with some feisty women to boot.  Some sequences may get the blood pumping and the constant bumping soundtrack will leave you thinking that you've just participated in such an illegal street race yourself.The acting is wooden and Diesel just portrays...well Diesel.  He stands there looking angry and mean and doesn't really do anything.

"Fun, but tried too hard","There's one thing that's always bugged me about this movie: that it's not what everyone who hasn't seen it thinks it is. For whatever reason, there had to be a tacked-on crime story, the whole subplot with Johnny Tran (he should've had a separate movie, and it's a shame that the amazing motorcycle stuntwork is now completely forgotten), and lots of interesting but generally uncohesive exposition about Dominic Toretto. In fact, you could compare this movie to a ""ricer"", with lots of bits that look cool but don't add anything.If you want action, you got it. The racing is always exciting (well, as exciting as going in a straight line can be), the trailer hijackings need to be seen to be believed, and of course, I loved the motorcycle chase at the end. But I wanted a movie about street racing. STREET RACING, not cops or crime families or vendettas or divided loyalties or love triangles or any of that meaningless junk. A good screenwriter could make a movie about racing work. As it is, we're left with a fairly generic action movie that's a notch above average.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
"It coming at you, FAST AND FURIOUS.","Action movies consists on three things, fast cars, good chases and good actors and characters.

Together, they form a duo. They so discover that the street racing is causing theft to occur in L.A. So, it's up for Walker's character to tracked own these robbers before they hit again. The Fast and the Furious is a good action flick for the summer because it combined the energy level to high as the chases become greater and greater. As for Walker and Diesel, these guys know how to act. They know what's the game is. When the game is on, they go at it.

"What I have learned from this movie: Vin Diesel, even shirtless","does not a movie make.Oh, it had it's moments. There was certainly talent in this movie. And one of the bestest exploding cars ever. And Diesel has a certain . . . charisma, even when I don't quite get the game.But I just didn't get it. Admittedly, I'm not a fan of the genre. Maybe if I was, it would have seemed more coherent, instead of a of ""day in the life"" mojo.There were too many characters, too many wandering subplots, too many moments where I was going ""huh?"" And then not really caring.I did like that the two major female characters weren't ditzes or helpless. The girlfriend even throws one of the best punches in the film, even though her apparent age did get close to my squick line. But good grief, you've got Vin Diesel, and the only real fight scene he's in, he's hitting someone who's already down? Maybe it's 'cause I know him through Pitch Black/ Chronicles of Riddick, but I want superhero (okay, super anti-hero) stuff. I want him in real fights. I want preternatural.The movie might have been better if it had been more violent, more sexual. Or it might have been better if it had had a tighter plot. Or it might have been better with more things blowing up. Mmm, explosions. As it was, it was fine. But I don't think I'll be watching it again.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
Tons better than I'd heard-- An entertaining thrill ride!,"This was a pretty good movie. I'm not a car freak, but I do appreciate fine machinery. That's not enough for a movie I'd go see, however, so i was hesitant to watch ""The Fast and the Furious."" I did get the DVD, though, and am glad I did. Maybe my low expectations helped me to enjoy it-- I admit that I was pleasantly surprised. There are two heros-- the blond guy, and Vin Deisel. The blond guy was an annoying weasel and wuss for the first three fourths of the flick, and then I began to like him. The other hero is played by Deisel, an amazing actor. I'd seen him in ""Saving private Ryan,"" but nothing else. This dood' screen presence is magnetic. He's got charisma as well as depth. My guess is we'll see Deisel become a solid and major star--- that is, if he chooses his roles and career moves rightly.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
Great action and illogic make this a good B movie,"The Fast and the Furious star the always good Vin Diesel as a car racer- on the streets.  He meets Brian (Paul Walker) in a good stoke of luck as he saves him from the cops.  Then some more plot comes in into the film, but it the action that counts here.Giving credit where credit is due, the film has outstanding action sequences involving car chases that haven't been this exhilarating since the infamous pod race in Phantom Menace.  Plus (and surprisingly), the film envelops you into the story, and it makes you feel some actual feeling for the characters among the blaze of the cars.  And for that I reccomend this movie for the thrill seeking audience that has chomped up the recent popcorn flicks such as Mummy 2, Tomb Raider and Swordfish (Fast and Furious is one of the best ones of it's kind so far this year).However, with most B flicks come the inevitable flaws, and this has 2 usual yet still dumb ones.  1, from the looks at some of the steamy and violent scenes in the movie, it looks like as if director Cohen was making a rated R movie filled with even more action, sexual content and dare I say naughty language in the mix.  Yet, once again, it might seem, the guys up top have made this film into yet another PG-13 flick to try and up the sales.  That's why say what you will about the South Park movie, but at least they kept on trying at it until they got the R (and that is also evident from the s**t episode from 2 days ago) unlike such movies as Bring It On and Coyote Ugly.And 2 (illogical part), this film takes place in Los Angeles, a city that is sometimes called the city on wheels.  Then how come when the race in the streets scenes come up, you almost see no cars whatsoever on the streets (unless it's used for the plot or something)?  I have a feeling that even though this doesn't have much logic in it, at least it's better here than in New York, cause then it would be just plain ludicrous.  Anyway, like I said, It's a good action movie, though not a great one.  Kudos go to the director, stunt co-ordinators, drivers and Diesel.  B+",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Worst than Worst,"I saw this movie because my brother recommended it. Big mistake. If you like cinema and movies (any kind) don't waste your time. It's just a show off of modified cars and a plot as shallow as the piece of paper it's written on. If you like cars, chases, and scantly clad women (which don't make a good movie at all), then this is for you. Shallow acting. Silly lines. Loud soundtrack. Lousy camera movements. Plastic characters. Flat performances. Amazingly predictable story line. Empty script... Finally I felt myself pushed into adding this line just to fill the minimum. There is really very little that can be added to this movie. And it's quite difficult to find word that define the rage any serious movie-lover feels at seeing this junk being released. As if one sin wasn't enough, they actually made two sequels. This proofs that the minds of the studio bosses and the minds of the teenagers (which are the only ones that can enjoy such a trash) are one and the same. Really the movie does not deserve more. 1/10",1.0,Anonymous,Crime

Fast And The Furious Decent But With Flaws,"The Fast and the Furious is decent but with flaws from director Rob Cohen whose admirable in making this movie about an undercover cop who infiltrates an underground subculture of street racers in Los Angeles. The cast for the most part are good in their roles including Paul Walker, Vin Disiel, Michelle Rodriguez, Jordana Brewster, Rick Yune, and Ted Levine but some of them (Yune and Levine to name a few) lack screen time. Ja Rule even makes a brief extended appearance but his character like others aren't in it that much to leave an impression. The racing sequences are intense but there's some you can tell is obviously CG which is okay because thats the only way they could ever show the characters going so fast in the movie. The action sequences are well executed but some of them can over the top at times. The dialogue wasn't the greatest at times either and there were some predictable things that happened. For those of you who have seen it you might know I'm talking about. If you're a fan of these type of films than you might like this one better than I did. Despite it's flaws though overall The Fast And The Furious isn't that bad it does have intense action/race sequences, some suspense, and good performances by the cast but the movie as a whole could have been better.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime

A movie for car fans and not only...,"""The Fast and the Furious"" is the first movie of the rest that it followed and I think that with the second one were the only movies which did not have so many visual effects.In this movie we watch an undercover police officer (Paul Walker who plays as Brian O'Conner) who gets involved with street racing and becomes very popular from that. Vin Diesel makes a really good interpretation as Dominic Toretto who plays as a street racer. Also good interpretations made in this movie by Jordana Brewster (Mia Toretto) who plays as Dominic Toretto's sister and Michelle Rodriguez (Letty) who plays as the girlfriend of Dominic Toretto.I liked very much ""The Fast and the Furious"" movie because it shows us how is to be in this world of super cars, races, speed and all of that stuff, and makes you also feel all of these one by one.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
What it lacks in substance it makes for in style,"The Fast and the Furious is one of those movies that everybody watches and majority of people like , although it predominately appeals to the brainless boy racer a!shole genre there is no denying th almost street racing craze it has a hand in playing. The plot is not the the brainiest so don't go expecting a grossing movie and the acting is a little drape and the script is quite crap to be honest . But then at the end of the day it is a movie that you would check out for the action as there are some very well made car races and sequences put together. Personally I would not look into it saying it is the best car movie made as there have been better ones out there like Gone in 60 secs but it is worth a rent , I mean if you get fast , cars women and action and semi good acting from Diesel , Brewster and Rodrgieuz.THE FAST AND THE FURIOUS : 6.7 OUT OF 10",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
The Ultimate Summer Movie,"I just back from seeing The Fast and the Furious and i have to say i have never been so pumped after seeing a film. Keep in mind from the moment i saw the trailer for this film i wanted desperately to see it. It had fast cars, Fast girls, and it guaranteed some pretty cool action sequences. Needless to say that i wasn't disappointed and this has made my list of best movie of the summer so far.The plot in this film is pretty basic. A undercover cop named Brian(Paul Walker) is sent to get the inside scoop on a group of street racers who may or may not be smuggling equipment from pick-up trucks. The street racing team is lead by Dom(Vin Diesel). Brian however begins to fall for Dom's sister Mia(Jordana Brewster) and things begin to become truly complicated.Why is this the ultimate summer movie? You can go into this film with no expectations and be truly entertained. It's mindless fun so to speak and it's a good way to spend 90 minutes. I enjoyed every minute of this film and as the title promises there is a lot of Furious action.The racing sequences are done really well and are the best i've seen in a long while. There are some good camera shots and camera angles and these shots make the races even more exhilarating. The best sequence has to be towards to end that involves cars and one big pick-up truck.The acting is also pretty good. Vin Diesel is going to be huge. He is a very commanding performer and he alone carries this film acting wise. The same can not be said for Paul Walker who is very flat. I said this before in my review of the skulls the guy needs some lessons stat. The girls are really good in the film. Jordana brewster displays the sensitvity and sensuality that is needed to portray her character and Michelle Rodriguez as dom's girlfriend letty is just one big ball of sass. i loved this character and i wish she could've been in the film more.All in all a good summer movie. i'm sure you won't be disappointed.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime

Go rent Casablanca or something. The cars are slower, but you'll probably enjoy it much more.That being said...I though this was a great movie...for the low/young talent, big budget action movie that it is. The cars are fast and shiny. The women are fast and shiny. Sure the acting is sub-par, the plot is non-existent, and disbelief must be suspended to watch it, but if you're expecting more from a movie about cars with a title as un-original as ""The Fast and the Furious"" then maybe you ought to stop and evaluate where the real disconnect takes place between the quality of Hollywood movies and the people who see them.And yes, this movie made a butt-load of money because it was targeted at the 18-35 male demographic, because guess what...they spend the most money!!!",,Anonymous,Crime
Where's the American Hotrod v-8?,"Ok i have to give this movie some credit, the story was (i thought) interesting.

But what fantasy city is this where there are a bunch of 4 cylinders that gather and no 8cyl car for miles??? The main character drove a Supercharged lightning and races in a crappy 4 cyl. I think that the creators of this movie forgot that the the world record for acceleration is held by a v-8. Of course there was 1 mean car in the movie, but... the first time you see it run, well you'll just have to see just what happens for your self.

"Great Cars, Cool Stunts, Bad Movie","I attended an advance screening of ""The Fast and the Furious"" with high anticipation. Here, I thought, is my cool sexy action movie for the summer. I was looking for pure entertainment with just a thread of credibilty. What I got was a lopsided movie with great cars, amazing stunts, crappy acting, and bad editing. If one-fourth of the attention given to the cars had been paid to the acting and the human film story, the movie would have been just fine. Unfortunately, this was not the case.First of all, this movie really reminded me of Point Break with Keanu Reeves, only instead of surfing, street racing is the centerpiece.Both stories are completely improbable. Both stories involve green cops sent to infiltrate gangs of thieves who use the loot to fund their expensive hobbies. In both films, the hero jeopardizes his case by gaining a dangerous level of respect for the charismatic leader of the band of thieves.  The big difference between the two films is that while Point Break works, The Fast and the Furious does not. The failing point of this film is the lead actor. Paul Walker is the sucking-chest wound of this movie. Yeah, he's pretty, but he completely unable to emote or communicate anything about his character. Even in the presence of excellent actors like Vin Diesel and Ted Levine, he is like a plank of wood. Jordana Brewster isn't too pro either. All the other actors(including Michelle Rodriguez)do a fine job.Had the basic criteria been met(competent lead actor, clean editing), The Fast and the Furious could have been great. As is, it is moderately awful.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime

To be honest, I have no idea if street racing is an Asian-American thing, but if my son is right, then this movie becomes the Saturday Night Fever of its day, Fever also being a movie based on a magazine article, where the subculture in question (in SNF's case, gay disco) is homogenized for mainstream consumption (goodbye, gay disco boys or Asian speed fanatics, hello Italian-Americans and Vin Diesel, who may be of unknown ethnicity but who is probably not of Asian descent).

Not much else to say, but whoever participated in that movie (in whatever position - from director to the last extra - except of course for Vin, who shines out in this like a shaft of gold when all around is dark) should under no circumstances quit their day jobs.

"It is a neat, nitrous oxide powered glamour film","The surprisingly humble beginnings (by comparison) of what is now a six film series, The Fast and the Furious was a hit for bringing a new lease of life to the racing film.An undercover cop, Brian O'Conner, must discover who is to blame for goods trucks being hi-jacked and stolen by drivers in high performance street cars. He puts himself into the urban culture of street racing where he meets Dominic Toretto and his team. Brian falls for Dominic's sister, Mia, in the process and threatens his investigation and his life.The film is quite a brainless piece of entertainment, its story is predictable, it follows an undercover cop who starts to sympathize with his targets, and the characters are written spontaneously to fit the demands of the plot. You gotta love the opening dialogue: ""I like the tuna here,"" ""Nobody likes the tuna here!"" Plus, Paul Walker really is a bland actor.But, that isn't why we watch the film. The Fast and the Furious does have some great car racing scenes and director Rob Cohen can shoot the cars and make them look great. What is most appealing is the physicality of the stunts and the racing; there's no CGI tomfoolery here, and there is a simplicity about the film that makes it worth watching. You don't need to suspend your disbelief, the plot doesn't shovel many excuses for racing into your face.It is a neat, nitrous oxide powered glamour film.

A Superior 21st Century B Movie,"In terms of the profile of the performers involved and the money spent on its production, this film seems to be a minor picture in comparison to the megabucks blockbusters the studios release. However, considering it was made by a major studio and apes the style of the blockbusters, you can't really call this an Independent picture either. It seems the best way to define this movie is as a B-Movie, changes in film convention and monetary inflation notwithstanding.This is not intended to devalue the film - Assault on Precinct 13, New Jack City and some of the best movies of the 1940s were B-movies. All it means is it doesn't have stars and doesn't pretend to be a particularly original work of art, and would consider itself a success if enough people buy tickets for it to make its money back. Many such films are forgettable, some are patently awful, some are entertaining on some level, while a few manage to hit the right mixture and make for very good cinema. They also used to provide a great breeding ground for new talent to try their luck with limited resources and less risk than the big leagues, and the cinema could do with more such opportunities for new film-makers to try out. ""The FastAnd The Furious"" doesn't quite hit the heights achieved by John Carpenter's early work or the golden age of Noir but I'm certainly not sorry I watched it.Paul Walker comes across as a blond Keanu but is engaging as the undercover cop investigating high-speed robberies whose culprits seem to hang around the illegal street racing scene in LA. Vin Diesel (who was superb as the convict in Pitch Black) is charismatic in the more interesting ""guy on the edge"" role, and everyone else does their job effectively. The familiar story follows of an undercover mission  becoming complicated by loyalty, emotions, and things not being as simple as they look, with some good high speed driving sequences along the way. The performances, direction, characterisation and dialogue are not exactly Oscar-winning but to use the racing analogies used by all the papers who reviewed this movie, it is flashy, has a good engine and overcomes a slight lack of finesse through pace and energy. Better still, you can tell from the opening titles and delirious first race that this is not intended as anything more than fun entertainment, so you forgive the cliches and occasional false move from the script. It certainly stands comparison with any of the $100m mega productions against which it was competing.The whole thing plays out nicely to a big action finale, and it chooses one of the handful of recognised ways for a story like this to end. Overall, it was a fun movie and worth watching once for anyone who likes a bit of unpretentious high speed fun. Rent the video, relax and enjoy.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime

Completely forgettable entertainment,"I waited a pretty long time before seeing this movie because I didn't want to deal with the rice rocket rallies during the first few weekends.  I knew, just from the previews, that it would attract a large audience, no matter whether it was actually a decent film or not.  After seeing it, I have to admit, once I turned off the analytical part of my brain, I enjoyed it. While it's definitely true that the screenplay was trite and predictable and most of the actors were seemingly hired based on looks rather than talent, this film was saved by a few things.  The most obvious of this film's saviors was the outstanding camera work during the films many chase/race sequences.  Also, Vin Diesel has a magnetic charisma that makes his even his non-racing scene watchable.  A few of the other actors, in particular Michelle Rodriguez, turn in passable performances too, although I'm definitely not impressed by pretty boy Paul Walker, who phones in a typical and contrived performance.  Overall, if, like me, you're able to turn off the part of your brain that wants you to scream ""Who talks like that???"", then you'll probably find this an enjoyable film, if forgettable, film. 3/5",6.0,Anonymous,Crime

This movie rocks,"You people!  This movie was the best of the summer.  Everyone is slamming it for not being artistic or something, but did you expect it to be?  I didn't.  I expected a major testosterone rush and I got it.FaF warranted three sittings in the theatre.  It had the best cinematography since Crouching Tiger and Fight Club, and it had good special effects.  If all anyone ever watched was a movie like Traffic that was an intellectual movie then he or she would not have a credible say about the quality of a movie.

Somehow Created a Series,"Los Angeles police officer Brian O'Connor (Paul Walker) must decide where his loyalty really lies when he becomes enamored with the street racing world he has been sent undercover to destroy.As of now (2016), I cannot even keep track of how many films there are in this series. At least eight, maybe nine, and that's not counting the original version which has almost nothing to do with this one. How this movie spawned a whole industry is beyond me.Not that it is a bad movie, but it really has no depth at all. A guy races cars, and everyone else races cars, and the guy is attracted to another guy's sister. It all falls into place so easily, no hassle, no time to find out who anyone is.

Unique and very entertaining,"It's pretty hard at this point in time to call anything ""groundbreaking"" in cinema, there's so much trash out there that is either eye candy, mindless or a rehash of some movie made much better years ago. I thought this one rises above other recent efforts largely because of the screen presence of Vin Diesel. Walker is undercover cop out to get behind recent truck-jackings in California. Diesel is an L.A. car hot-shot who is a prime suspect for the crimes. Walker insinuates himself into Vin's group and takes the lay of the land from there. Brewster is very attractive and effective as Diesel's sister and Walker's love interest. There's two things about this movie I think unique - Diesel's character (a strange mix of menace, indifference and personal loyalty), and the focus on the hopped-up econocar culture these guys operate in. I've seen bits and pieces of Diesel in other movies and he seems darker and less effective there, I think he worked well with the quietly upbeat Walker on this one. I'm hoping the new Fast & Furious can live up to this entry, well done!",9.0,Anonymous,Crime

In fact when you think about it , it's quite ridiculous. These street racers aren't kids but they are acting like teenagers and they just happen to have 2k rolled up in their pockets to bet when they race against each other! .

Who needs good writing when you have fast cars and big crashes??,"Depending on the age group you fall under, you may or may not like this movie. But then again, that's true of a lot of movies but this one seemed to have a very specific target audience and it seemed to be between the ages of 17 to 23 and predominately male. I fall outside of this age group but it doesn't mean a bad review¬Öit just means that it's not going to be a good review either. Well, it might. I guess you'll just have to read to the end of the review to find out. Typically movies aimed at this target audience tend to be high on the stunts and low on just about everything.Fast and Furious is about cars. Fast cars to be specific. And not the type that belongs on the race track but the kind that gets you arrested for going a zillion miles an hour down a city street in the middle of the night. This movie is about a young man that enters the underground life of street racing. Something that happens in every city. But apparently this past time is rather cliquish and getting in with the `in-crowd' isn't always easy nor does everyone accept you. It's not that different than belonging to a gang it seems. Get in with one group and you're the enemy of another group, which means that you're going to have the typical `turf war' issues. You're also going to have your `boy meets sister of big bad brother' side story and all the other issues that go along with it. There's a bit of a twist but nothing that I haven't seen in other gang/drug related movies that have something to do with young people. In fact this movie reminded me a lot of `Point Break' except I enjoyed that movie.If it sounds like I'm not really all that enthused about the plot line it's because I'm not. There was really nothing that was too terribly original about the storyline. In fact, if you look at the trailers, you'd think this movie was based on the video game `Need for Speed'. The colors used and the cars involved could have easily come out of that game and the characters? Definitely could have been taken out of a video game. The writing was full of clich√©s and the delivery of them wasn't overly well done. At some points I thought to myself `Did he actually say that?? That's so cheesy!' or `Please don't say that next line, please, please, please!' but they did. Not enough time was spent on developing the relationships we see. We're just kind of told about them but not in a way that really enlightens us, just that this relationship exists so accept it.So far this review is sounding pretty negative isn't it? Well, I have to say that the stunts were kind of interesting. The car chase scenes (and there's a lot of them) were pretty well done and some of the scenes they do with the semi-trucks were interesting but not all that believable.So you're wondering, is there anything worth seeing about this movie? Hmmm, maybe depending on if you fit that target group I was talking about. If you have a hot car and like to see some hot cars with neat toys and some street racing, then this movie's for you. Other than that, I wouldn't really see it. The dialogue alone would make you want to get pulled over for road rage.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime

QUITE POSSIBLY THE WORST MOVIE EVER MADE!!!!!!!!!,"This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen.  The idea of street racing is cool, because I personally do it and I love it, but this movie totally blew it's potential.  Not only that, it's a huge rip off of ""Point Break.""  An undercover cop, trying to get the inside on these street racers who are suspected to be robbing 18-wheelers, while falling in love with the girl who is on the side of the street racers.  That rite there is a horrible plot and should've been tossed at the site of that garbage.  There were also many other things wrong with the film. First, you see the driver's using nitrous on their rice burning cars like 4 or 5 times in a single race.  That is almost not even possible because the Japanese cars they are using can't take that kind of pressure on the engine block.  They could last about 2 shots of nitrous, maybe 3, before their engine block blew up and/or cracked, or before you had to do a complete rebuild of the engine, both top-end and bottom-end construction.Secondly, when they race at the beginning, they do a mile long race, which no idiot would do because to determine the winner, all you really need to race is a quarter of a mile. And lastly, the movie would have been a tremondous amount better if they used AMERICAN CARS!!!!!!  All these ""new age"" racers nowadays try to supe up their Honda Civics and their Eclipse's, and none of them were designed to race and none of them could ever compete with the kind of power an AMERICAN CAR could put out.The only two cars in the film that are worth any respect are the Ford Lightning, that doesnt even see the drag strip, which is stupid considering that it does a 10 second quarter-mile which is damn good, and the Dodge Challenger, which THANK GOD is raced, cuz if it wasnt i would have killed myself, but sadly ends up being destroyed by that idiot Vin Diesel.

"Yeah, it's funny how that works out.","The plot is similar to the 1991 cult classic Point Break. The backstories are scattered, and filled with over-the-top racing sequences and action scenes. This film feels like a standalone; at the time, they didn't seem to be thinking about a sequel. The background music fails to make an impact and is often noisy and distracting on many occasions. Some scenes, like hijacking a truck with Honda Civics to steal VHS players, feel illogical and foolish. The investigator's office scenes are boring and annoying due to poor acting and dialogue.Walker and Diesel give average performances, bouncing off one another but unable to convey a deeper emotional level. Rodriguez is particularly bad with her constant frowning and poor one-liners, while Brewster delivers a decent performance. Overall, an unoriginal undercover plot that focuses more on car racing and an unrelatable underground culture with slutty women.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime

"Point Break 2 : Less surfing, more cars","This is an 'okay' film, the acting is 'okay', the script is 'okay', the direction is 'okay' and so on. At no point does it ever threaten to become exciting, but neither does it ever try putting you to sleep. So it's definitely another movie from Rob Cohen.The main problem is that this is a virtual retread (ahem) of the far superior 'Point Break'. The plot? An undercover cop gets involved with a group of fast-living criminals and finds himself with divided loyalties thanks to a beautiful woman. If you've seen 'Point Break' you'll be constantly comparing the two and finding the older movie to be far superior.'Point Break' was well structured, there was a constant pull on the central character, dragging him into the criminal gang until he found himself deeply and inextricably caught up in their activities. Whereas 'The Fast and the Furious''s Officer O'Connor is even more gung-ho than the bad guys. Who can care what happens to the good guy if he wants to be the baddie?It's also lazily directed. 'Point Break' left your heart pounding with its chase scenes or the incomparable parachute drop. Here, there is little that hasn't been seen before and done better. The first car race does work well, but the climactic car chase is far too long, not at all well edited, and falls flat. Likewise it fails to utilise the locations. If you travel through nighttime LA, you see something between a dream and an industrial nightmare - here it is a few neon lit streets that could have been anywhere. What a waste of a great location.Finally the movie has a lazy ending which appears to have been lifted directly from 'Point Break', the cop who is friends with the master criminal in one final confrontation. Except that this time it is a gutless ending which stinks of pandering to focus groups.In its defence, 'The Fast and the Furious' has two great points, the cars and Vin Diesel. The cars - well they are astonishing beasts and lovingly shot, Vin Diesel, once again has real presence on-screen and exudes menace. He is definitely bound for greater things, perhaps even a role where he can exercise his acting?If Summer 2001 had been a normal movie year, 'The Fast and the Furious' would have done respectable box-office and then sunk without trace. With precious little competition it has done far better than expected, but that says more about the other movies than this one.All in all, it's strange that a movie that revolves around cars doesn't appear to be firing on all cylinders.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime

Still one of the best action movies.,"If you're looking for a fast-paced, action-packed movie with a thumping soundtrack and fantastic photography and cinematograpy, you can't go wrong with 'The Fast and The Furious'.With a franchise now spawning 9 films and a 10th in the making, this original film is still by far the best. (Since number 6, the films became overblown on all levels almost to the point of becoming fantasy or superhero movies, and I lost interest). The incredibly awesome cars are bound to give car enthusiasts an instant orgasm. They are STUNNING!Paul Walker plays a cop who goes undercover to infiltrate a team of street racers, suspected of hijacking trucks and stealing their goods. As luck would have it - surprise, surprise - he falls for the leader's sister. The leader being Dom, portrayed by Vin Diesel. The casting in general is very good and the experienced cast ensure credibility. 'The Fast and the Furious' is an action movie with substance, nice fleshed out characters and a good story. The sound effects are also excellent.Mother Mary, the stunts are incredible!! The truck scene towards the end is nail-biting fun. And the finale is stunning. Quite an adrenaline rush, really. With all the cars, action, adventure and great soundtrack, 'The Fast and the Furious' was destined to become a hit! This is a thrilling action movie to enjoy again and again.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

Total garbage.,"Ridiculously bad movie.  Obviously written by a couple of just-post pubescents, who think that souped up Honda's chasing each other is ""Waaaay cool!""  This film has no redeeming qualities.  If you want to watch a movie about ""guys racing for pink slips"", watch American Graffiti instead - at least IT has a plot.  And in American Graffiti, the cars are some REAL metal, not some goofy, tricked out Hondas that annoy old folks by driving down streets with their stereos with waaaaay too much bass that you can hear from 2 miles away.I just recently watched this film, and I can honestly say that I don't remember anything about a ""plot.""  A plot would just get in the way of ""cars going dangerously fast down city streets.""  There were no notable quotes. There was no notable acting.  Vapid - completely lacking any merit whatsoever.Lousy movie, Mel, I give a 1 - but only because the scale doesn't go down any further.",1.0,Anonymous,Crime
ONE FURIOUS THRILL RIDE!,"I haven't been able to get to the movies this summer to see stuff like ""Tomb Raider"" and ""Swordfish"", but I'm glad that caught ""Fast and The Furious"". This was one of the best action movies that I've seen in a long time. This movie had tight cars, good acting, great plot, and continuous action from beginning to end. This tells the story of an undercover cop who has to infiltrate a group of illegal street racers who also may be involved in a highjacking ring. But things get complicated when he develops a close friendship with the leader and falls in love with his sister. I loved every minute of this movie, even Ja Rule's cameo.

Unintentionally good for a laugh,"I rated this a 7 because I saw it in theaters when I was a teenager and it was pretty much the coolest thing ever and made for some good memories with friends. After having rewatched it recently I realized how dumb and immature I must have been back then. Decided to write my first review ever.The movie is visually great, good looking actors, cool cars for the time, most would say really hot girls although personally I only thought Mia was attractive. Music was good, cinematography was great, minus the few shakey camera race scenes. It had just enough action scenes to keep you interested and engaged.Now for the bad.. Acting and dialogue was atrocious, literally the cheesiest 1 liners i've ever heard in any movie ever, and its non stop throughout the whole movie. Vin diesel was okay considering what the actors had to work with. I Can't really think of a lead besides paul walker that would have made the movie any better, that being said he was terribly bad.(RIP) Chasing down Big Rigs with honda civics, jumping onto moving semi trucks going 70 mph makes absolutely no sense, Im sure they could have thought of an easier way to hijack the trucks, but they had to make it cool right? Paul Walker was literally the worst person ever to cast as an undercover cop, Michelle rodriguez was cringe and annoying to look at with a permanent scowl on her face trying to be more badass than vin diesel. Vince literally called Brian a Buster at one point, and I could literally go on forever with just how cheesy the movie is, dont even get me started on all the over the top unrealistic Car/Racing stuff. I just think the movie tried to take itself way too serious..Overall the movie is a good mindless watch, it really does make you laugh out loud even though its not trying to and even though the rest of the movies suck, this one however silly is an iconic film that won't be forgotten.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
A comprehensive look at a growing subculture,"This movie cannot take credit for creating the subculture it depicts, but it can take credit for the multi-millions in business it created.  As the owner of a car club, I could not wait to veiw this movie when it came out.  I went on opening night at 11pm and the theater was standing room only.I have to say I was a little disappointed that the cars used were so common. It doesn't take any inspiration to build an Eclipse or a Honda.  Anyway, the rest of the film was amazing, down to detailing how most of us get our amazing ""paint"" jobs!This film was fantasy, but these people are real.  I live this life everyday, except highjacking tractor trailers. But a word of caution, do not try to drive under a truck.  The one used in the film was raised.  And don't race on surface streets.  It happens, but it's extremely dangerous.When I left the theater, about 120 of the hooked cars in town fled in a continuous line to a road across town, where we cruised for the next four hours.I can't wait till the sequel comes out.  Vin Deisel and Paul Walker can check out my car anytime.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Great racing scenes, dumb crime scenes","Not a bad movie overall - some of the racing scenes, especially the first one, were truly awesome.  If they had just stuck to the racing, it would have been a great movie.  But they had to write in this really dumb crime plot involving hijacking of moving 18 wheeler trucks with little tiny Honda racecars.  I mean, what truck driver wouldn't just run over these little cars and be done with it?  Later on in the movie, motorcycles are hijacking moving cars at gunpoint.  Who in a car wouldn't just run over the motorcycles?  What reality do writers for movies like this live in?  But all in all, the racing scenes are good enough that it's probably worth seeing the movie anyways, but just be prepared to laugh at these ridiculous, needlessly complex hijacking scenes.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime

"""I owe you a 10-second car.""","(520-word review) Film number one is in the bag; wow, there are NINE more.Everything about this was 2000s galore; the music, the outfits, the cars, the dialogue, the personalities of the characters, and the somewhat grainy/fuzzy cinematography. All of that adds to the charm, specifically the cinematography. The time-lapses and the nighttime cinematography were good.A nostalgia trip for most people, looking back. A combination of experiencing that time and this film back then. For me, it's more of an understanding (""Damn, a film that came out in 2001 is the epitome of 2000s pop culture"") than a feeling; frankly, some of it didn't land for me, particularly the constant blasting of music, both songs and the score.Throughout this film's duration, I wasn't feeling much of a story there; humble beginnings, given what the franchise develops into. You could say the same for those films, as far as not ""much of a story there"" is concerned, and that's probably accurate. More or less. Yet part of me feels the plots in those films are better. I NEED to hear the word 'family' in every line.Either way, the ramped-up outrageousness in those films likely makes up for it if that's not the case, whereas this one doesn't have that. The calm-before-the-storm/humble beginnings nature made the lackluster story stick out.The ""purpose"" behind it regarding Brian O'Conner (also, I already knew the plot twist concerning him, but I can't remember how) was lackluster; the ""real"" purpose of the overall film was undoubtedly the aesthetic. The cars and the racing: being ""cool."" And the developing camaraderie between him and Dominic Toretto, of course.In that vein, it was the best part, starting with the final heist: the development between them, especially everything after Dom learns the truth and Brian immediately goes to his place; that scene with them was well-acted by Vin Diesel and Paul Walker.That's also when the film began moving along, picking up steam. Becoming more enjoyable, as up to that point was less so. That includes the romantic angle with Brian and Mia, which was 'there.' Nothing more, nothing less. There wasn't much focus on it anyway, for some reason, and it wouldn't have made a difference if it wasn't there.My main criticism was Paul Walker's acting (although he was good-looking: his hair, in particular). While writing this, I have no idea whether people have said/are saying anything about it, particularly in this way. But yeah. His acting was mediocre until the scene with Brian and Dom at Dom's house after the final heist; his and Vin Diesel's acting in that scene was their best in the film.Acting-wise, Chad Lindberg (Jesse) was up there with Vin, and there should've been more of him. Bars. He even resembled Aaron Paul. Or not. It was more so the vibe and personality of the character that made me think of that comparison. Chad (Jesse) could've played Jesse Pinkman.As a film that's pure 2000s style and aesthetic from the music to the clothing, the Brian-Dom camaraderie held it up, complimented by the charm and action sequences.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

If you like cars, street racing and watching a movie to see the cars only we can dream about this is it. Plus, these aren't fifth rate actors, because they spent money on the cars.

Fast And Furious,"The plot of this film is actually blunt and simple in logic, without all the thrills and twists in ordinary police movies. While performing an undercover mission, Brian fell in love with Dom's sister, and was also infected by Dom's personality charm. In the end, he solved the case but let him go, which was a very reasonable and natural ending. Although the plot is ordinary, by interspersing various racing elements, the whole film is still very fresh and watchable, giving the audience a brand new concept of speed.This film has given us too many interpretations of racing, passion, and friendship. It is obviously very exciting and fresh, but it also conveys some very traditional and warm concepts, and it has well established the plot, background and identity of the characters.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

Sometimes it focused too much on that instead of the cars, racing, and action which is why someone would watch a movie like this I assume? There were 3 or 4 really good scenes with those things that saved the movie for me. Overall kind of a mixed bag for a first installment but hopefully I'll end up liking the sequels more with the more modern it gets and higher the stakes with the characters as time goes on.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

An inconsistent attempt at what could have been so much more.,"Taking one of the words out of the title, I am furious that the film did not live up to its potential.  By this I mean the fact that yet again, we have a dumb Hollywood script laden with the corniest lines imaginable.  Credibility is also riding high in deficiency, when you consider the fact that Vin Diesel's character must be invincible, seeing as how he manages to escape injury, after colliding with a truck at over 150 mph.  Retreating back from the criticism for a moment, the cars in the film are breathtaking and the score certainly pumps out serious wattage--although that's the problem, the cars are the focus point and being that's the case, shouldnt Rob Cohen (the director) have constructed better action sequences, that actually had depth enough to keep his audience entertained.  You would think so.Struggling to find a commendable word to say I can only consider the aspects about the film that could have been so easily improved, given the subject matter; if you think about it fast cars, babes, violence and sex should make for a solid, thrilling 90 minutes.  Instead we settle for the sluggish, dull experience that most of us would gladly replace with GONE IN 60 SECONDS any day of the week.  Let's face it at least GONE IN 60 had Angelina, not to mention action guru Jerry Bruckheimer on board.Despite the distinct lack of praise from, well a large proportion of the western hemisphere, 'THE FAST AND THE FURIOUS' still managed to be lucrative by taking $144 million at the US box office.

'Corona'-Virus,"I've a couple of reasons for revisiting the ""F&TF"" franchise at the moment. There's a tenth film in cinemas now, so I could do with the refresher, but also the ""How Did This Get Made"" podcast is covering them, and I try to watch the films along with them whenever I can. Though it's showing it's age in a couple of places it was actually reasonably enjoyable.Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker) is an undercover police officer who infiltrates a team involved in illegal LA Street racing to try and find out who is behind a series of highly skilled thefts from trucks, whilst they are in motion. He infiltrates the team led by Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) but he doesn't believe that he is behind the crime, his vision though is clouded by an attraction to Toretto's sister Mia (Jordana Brewster).I was surprised about how much I actually enjoyed this. It's hilariously basic, compared to where the series ends up. Essentially, it's about stealing dvd players, that's how old the film in. There are no international terrorists, cagey CIA agents with unlimited budgets, or trips to space. There's some street racing, there's a reasonably well-planned heist and there's quite a bit of what looks like practical stunts. I was surprised about how much acting Vin Diesel does at this point in the franchise, he's warm and reasonable and doesn't just monosyllabically mumble the word ""Family"" every few minutes.It's really quite homophobic though and uses some terms that are absolutely unacceptable now. The portrayal of women is very much 'of the time', they are at best motivations for the actions and at worst literal prizes to be won or lost. The ending is a bit weak, and you wonder if they already had half an eye on the sequels by not arriving at a more definitive resolution for either of the main characters.I know there are much more exciting films to come in this franchise and a bit of a dip to come first, but I was surprised about just how watchable this one was.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

A great movie with great cars,"This movie is my favorite movie of all time- the acting was great, the story line was great and it was very fast, action-packed and well... furious!!! I loved how the movie allowed the viewer to create their own ending for themselves, and how Dominic Toretto being the villain was such a surprise. I really believed the hi-jackers were Johnny Tran and his gang!!! I would have never expected The Team.  The love between Brian Spilner and Mia Toretto was an added twist, giving the movie a lot more feeling to it then just fast women and fast cars.  Letty was great, she has an attitude that I totally agree with- it's time for the guys to take a back seat and let the girls show their stuff.  She also doesn't put up with crap from other girls when they are hitting on her man!!!  Leon and Jesse are great additions, Jesse being comical, but also being a very leading role in the whole situation.  Vince was a jerk, but without him, the movie would definitely not have been complete.  The cars were just sic, the effects and the drag racing making your adrenaline pump along with the characters'.

"Point Break, the remake or an homage","Paul Walker playing Keanu Reeves, even down to his voice and choice of sandwich (albeit different bread); Point Break is one of my favourite films, and I really enjoy Fast and Furious but it is more or less a play by play copy of the surf-ace movie ten years on. Vin Diesel is the Bodhi-esque sensei-master surrounded by his acolytes and is convincing; it's one of his best roles (along with Pitch Black 1). He's a powerhouse. The film is attractive, stylish with a hot soundtrack and showcases the street-racer subculture in Los Angeles.Paul Walker isn't just an ersatz Reeves, he is glorious in his own right; beautiful, sexy, tough, controlled and engaging and his chemistry with Jordana Brewster (Dom Toretto's little sister) was nice, but is overshadowed by the bromance between Dom and Brian. Michelle Rodriquez is a great female foil for Diesel; she's gorgeous and convincing as a high-octane junky.Hey, F&F is never going to win awards for the most intelligent film in existence but it's pretty, amusing in places, a little cheesy and poorly dubbed but good cinema and must have had something to spawn itself into one of the largest grossing film franchises of all time. It plays like a music video, with touches of CSI in the filming but much of it is a little pointless and OTT. Vin Diesel is perfect as Dom and his chemistry with all the characters is sparkling. He plays the showman well. Paul Walker is gorgeous, he really is a loss to the acting world, and this film is his magnum opus. Walker and Diesel were obviously buddies and as such it makes this film all the more special. It's great cinema but is definitely flawed, especially in the realm of script.

A Guilty Pleasure Movie at its Finest,"16 years and 7 films ago the Fast & Furious franchise wasn't the worldwide phenomena that it is now. It was once a cheesy Point Break rip-off that took itself way too seriously. But you know what, it was a darn good guilty pleasure movie. That's for sure.A lot has changed over the years in the series, but the one constant has always been that the films are about family. For all its faults, no one can deny how well this film does the family angle. It's not the best acting, writing, or directing, but you care enough about the characters to where you believe the motivations behind characters' actions regarding family. But let's talk about how ridiculous, stupid, and fun this movie is.They drive their cars (successfully) underneath semi-trucks several times throughout the film. So much so that when I was younger I believed it was possible. That word, ""possible"", will be used sparingly through the course of this film and the entire series. Where Furious 7 pushes the boundaries of reality by driving cars via one building to the next, The Fast and the Furious provides the unbelievable through street car races with seemingly a few hundred people. In the middle of the night, that is. Oh and those hundreds of people each have their own car and parking spot, that is. But that won't be the last time the film could have you roll your eyes.In fact, it's way easier to watch this film now that I've seen every installment to date. This film is extremely dated, but it's an interesting watch, especially considering where the series has gone to now. There's an underground motorcycle gang who steals DVD players and stashes them in a Thai-food restaurant. The climax of the film begins at an event called Race Wars. Creative huh? At one point, Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) tells someone to back off or she will scar her face with tire tracks. I guess my point is, if you don't accept the film for what it is, I don't think you'll have any fun with it.The real joy of this film comes by its goofiest and most outlandish moments, but also with its impressive stunts and action. In camera stunts may be this franchise's finest assets, and the last highway heist in this film is a thing of beauty. Yes, the film gets bogged down by a really dated and contrived script, but there's so much undeniable fun to be had here.

Too Fast & Furious for me,"We are all tired of fast cars as a central plot, but this is where it pretty much all started. The Fast & Furious epitomizes Racing Movies. Granted, they aren't my favourite type of movies to watch, but this one really hits the nail on the head.Foolproof storyline, star studded cast (for it's time) and of course, testosterone. Fast and Furious reeks of it, but I can only take so much. Yeah sure it was moderate action but, whether this was before HD or not, the way the cars looks when traveling at super speeds were far to fake for me. It looked cheesy and the green screen was obvious. Plus the acting of some of the cast was sub-par. I mean, who would of though that putting Ja Rule in a film would be prosperous. Mediocre at rapping, what makes you think he would be auspicious for a motion picture.I can't ignore the giant pink elephant in the room so lets get right to it. Vin Diesel. The bravado that follows Diesel in ever film he appears in is present here. In one of the ending scenes where Paul Walker's character reveals something shocking, the look that was given by Dom (Vin Diesel) was chilling in every sense of the word. He definitely out shined the rest of the actors. But Johnny Tran (Rick Yune)really surprised me. He made for a very compelling antagonist and I really wish he was is in the recent Fast & Furious'.All in all, you must see this revolutionary racing film. It has it's flaws but what movie doesn't?But what do I know I'm just a 15 year old boy.~Caesar Drake",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Fast cars, furious action, comatose plot","""The Fast and The Furious,"" directed by Rob Cohen and based on a magazine article about street racing, was undoubtedly one of the ""in"" movies during the summer of 2001, grossing over $140 million.To label it a ""surprise hit"" was erroneous. ""Furious"" was going to succeed no matter what, because, to put it bluntly, it was a dual-gratification film. The girls were aroused at its pretty-boy hunk stars, and the guys likewise at the four-wheeled penile extensions ¬ñ I mean the gaudy, overgarnished import cars.And after finally seeing it almost a year later, I wholeheartedly agree that it was ""in,"" all right: inept, inane, insipid, and inferior.The plot has undercover cop Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker) infiltrating a street-racing gang suspected of stealing and fencing electronic equipment. They spend the money on modifications to their rice burners, such as blowing $10,000 on speed-increasing nitrous oxide tanks. As Brian is accepted into the criminal fraternity by the gang leader, Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel), he also finds himself falling for Dom's sister, Mia (Jordana Brewster). Sure enough ¬ñ you guessed it ¬ñ Brian is increasingly hesitant to apprehend Dom for the thefts as their friendship grows over time. It sounds just as bad as it plays.I knew the script for ""Furious"" would be embarrassing, considering that it plays second banana to moving hunks of glass and steel, and I wasn't disappointed. I've read better dialogue on a cereal box. I mean, how can you beat lines like ""Damn, that guy's fast!"" and ""Hey, bro, you got a bathroom?""It's obvious the male leads were cast for their looks. Beach bum-looking Walker is hardly believable as a police officer or a street racer. Most of his close-ups show him staring at his co-stars with a blank half-grin. His attempt at sounding cool consists of, ""Check it out, it's like this."" If he wins the film's opening race, then he'll ""get the money and the respect."" (A telltale sign that he's a cop: he's the only driver in the entire movie who bothers to wear a seatbelt.)I must've been on another planet when it was decided that Diesel was the next big star in the making. Whatever the case may be, his popularity certainly isn't due to his acting. Here, he is emotionless when speaking lines that don't require him to scream, and as a result he sounds like he's reading off a teleprompter. He is victimized by poor dialogue as much as Walker; at one point, when Dom wistfully says to Brian, ""I live my life a quarter mile at a time,"" I wanted to spray the screen with Airwick.Early in the film, Dom and his buddies refer to Brian as ""the buster."" Does anyone even use that term anymore?Incredibly enough, both Walker and Diesel are outdone by Michelle Rodriguez in her unintentionally hysterical role of Dom's girlfriend. She performs the most grueling duty of the picture: standing around for ninety minutes with a permanent pout on her face. Then again, if I had lines like ""Why don't you skate before I leave treadmarks on your face?"" my lower lip would be protruding like a diving platform.Save for Brewster as Mia, the script prevents viewers from sympathizing with the poorly developed characters. As a result, any expressions of sentimentality come off as artificial. We don't feel sorry for characters who get shot at while stuck on an 18-wheeler, suffer a horrific car crash, or are gunned down in a drive-by shooting.The other type of race figures prominently in ""Furious,"" and the script gives it the finger by playing up stereotypes to the hilt. All the Mexican men wear khaki shorts and tall socks; one cracks racist jokes and ""has a last name but can't pronounce it."" Dom and Brian are harassed by motorcycle-riding, machine gun-toting Asians led by Johnny Tran (Rick Yune). Meanwhile, the Black crowd is so well-represented by Ja Rule in a spellbinding performance. (If you couldn't sense the sarcasm here, then you shouldn't be reading this.) When he talks, he sounds like he needs a Breathe-Right strip. Not surprisingly, he is the source of the film's only ""F"" word during his mercifully brief screen time.Big shock ¬ñ the women are portrayed as nothing more than scantily-clad armpieces in short skirts. Their sole purpose is to stand around while the cameras pan up from their ankles. The extras at the first race all cheer and jeer right on cue like Pavlov's dogs as Dom rambles about car parts. Perhaps they were amazed at his usage of big words.However, not everything is the fault of the actors. Much of ""Furious"" is just outright nonsense.For starters, I've hardly ever seen any cars that are covered in all those psychedelic graphics. The race and chase sequences suffer greatly at the hands of a combination of choppy editing and an overbearing rap soundtrack. Plus, what part of Los Angeles is deserted both day and night, and where does such a huge stretch of road exist on which four cars can race side-by-side while going over 140 miles an hour (that's over two miles per minute; I doubt that nearly eight miles of a city street can be illegally blocked off by spectators)? Are there always so many lead changes in such a short race? How can the characters afford these cars? Can someone go flipping and flying about in a '69 Charger, crash and then walk away with barely a scratch? How can Brian burn out his engine after hitting 140 and then drive away an instant later, or take his eyes off the road for long stretches of time during a race in order to operate not one, but two laptop computers?If I was a cop who was incompetent enough to let my prime suspect get away (""I owe you a ten-second car,"" Brian tells Dom before forking over the keys), my career would soon be in cinders after I was terminated for assisting in a criminal's escape.""The Fast and The Furious"" would have fared better had the script been as eye-popping as the cars. This movie does remain true to the essence of its subject matter in one aspect: it's one hell of a drag. 3/10",3.0,Anonymous,Crime

"""The Fast and the Furious""-  While the sequels have gotten better and better, the original feels a bit dated and ""safe.""  Fun, but not as entertaining as future installments.","The interesting thing about the long-running ""Fast and Furious"" franchise is that series fans seem to fall into one of two camps. Those who feel that the series started off decent but has gotten progressively better with each passing sequel. Especially as they take themselves less seriously and simply aim to entertain their audience more and more with increasingly insane and physics-defying action. And those who far prefer the earlier and slightly tamer installments for their slightly more grounded realism. And they tend to lament the fact that the later sequels have gone in an increasingly unrealistic and over- the-top direction. And as a result, I feel I must warn certain audience members... I'm most certainly in the former of those two groupings.Yes, I am somewhat sorry to say that to me, the franchise as a whole really didn't start picking up steam until about the third or fourth chapter. While by no means terrible, the earlier films haven't aged particularly well at all, and feel quite... docile and bland. Even the subject of this review- the original 2001 release from director Rob Cohen. It's a standard story and spends so much time on a plot ripped straight from ""Point Break"" (only substituting cars instead of surf-boards), that it doesn't really entertain to the same wild extent that later installments eventually reached.The film follows detective Brian O'Connor (the late Paul Walker), as he goes undercover to infiltrate the underground world of illegal street racing in Los Angeles. O'Connor and his superiors suspect that the same men and women who hold these illegal events are also responsible for a string of crimes throughout the city. He eventually forms a sort-of friendship with Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel), one of the most famed of the underground racers. O'Connors conflicted feelings about whether or not to bust him are further complicated when he starts to fall for Dominic's younger sister Mia (Jordana Brewster), and eventually his investigation will lead to a complex and wild finale through the streets of LA.The highlights here are the wonderful and at-the-time relatively unknown cast and the high-octane action that crops up here and there. This is the film that really put Vin Diesel and the others on the map. Everyone gives it their all, and everyone comes across very likable and endlessly cool in the film. Especially Diesel and Walker, who both shot to stardom in the months following the film's release. I also really liked Michelle Rodriguez, who plays a supporting role as Letty, Domonic's girlfriend. She has that tough- yet-sexy appeal and works really well in the film. Brewster and fellow co-stars like Rick Yune and Chad Lindberg similarly do admirable jobs. On the whole, just a great, fun cast.Director Rob Cohen, fresh off of a string of 90's hits including ""Dragonheart"" and ""Dragon: The Bruce Lee Story"", does a phenomenal job handling the action and adventure with his kinetic camera-work and unique use of color and saturation. Say what you will about the mixed quality of the films he's made- the man can make a thrilling sequence. You really feel the speed in the races and each crash hits you right in the gut. This is amongst his best work as a visual storyteller, and he delivers the action full-throttle. When the film goes into full- blown carnage, it works marvelously.Unfortunately, the film falters quite a bit thanks to the aforementioned stock-screen writing and for being a bit too dated when viewed in comparison to the rest of the series. For all intents and purposes, there's not a lot going on ""under the hood"" here. Every twist and turn is telegraphed from a mile away, characters fall into broad and undeveloped clich√©s (usually given a single ""quirk"" to define them, which is lazy screen writing 101), and you'll know how it ends pretty much immediately. It takes away a lot of the experience. The fact that the film is also basically a photocopy of the superior ""Point Break"" is also distracting at times and can occasionally lead to a lot of unintended giggles. In addition, this film feels very much a product of its time. This has ""Extreme 2001 movie!"" written all over it. From the music to the editing to even the slang used in conversation... the film is dated to the point it even occasionally feels a bit cringe- worthy.Still, I don't think it's a bad movie. Just a troubled one. And I do think it is still most certainly worth seeking out, especially as a prerequisite to viewing the entire series. It sets up a lot of characters and context that are expanded on in later films, and there's a lot of fun to be had with the great performances and top-notch action. For my money... It's one of the weaker ""Fast & Furious"" films. But it's still a ""Fast & Furious"" film through-and-through. And I say give it a shot.I give it an about-average 6 out of 10.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime

A Thrilling Ride with Limitations,"The Fast and the Furious (2001) is a high-octane action film that kicks off one of Hollywood's most successful franchises. The movie delivers on its promise of fast cars, intense street racing, and adrenaline-pumping action, creating an electrifying experience for fans of the genre. Vin Diesel and Paul Walker have undeniable chemistry as the leads, with Diesel's commanding presence and Walker's relatability balancing the dynamic. The film's underground car culture is portrayed with a certain charm, and the high-speed races are thrilling, providing a lot of visual excitement.However, while the film succeeds in its action and visual appeal, its plot and character development feel somewhat underwhelming. The story, centered around an undercover cop infiltrating a group of street racers, feels predictable and clich√©d at times. The dialogue can be cheesy, and some of the supporting characters lack depth, relying more on stereotypes than fully fleshed-out personalities. The film's pacing can also drag in moments where it focuses on non-racing action or exposition.The Fast and the Furious is undeniably entertaining, but it's not without its flaws. It serves up plenty of fun for fans of high-speed action, but those looking for more substance or sophisticated storytelling might find themselves wanting more. Still, it laid the foundation for a beloved franchise that would eventually grow into a much grander, globe-trotting saga.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
Fast & Furious - When Speed Replaces the Brain,"Toretto rules the streets of Los Angeles like a roaring warlord, with cars tricked out like modern knights' armor ready to slap you at 250 km/h. Paul Walker shows up, flashing his Colgate smile, to go undercover and bust the baddies hijacking semi-trucks. But instead of arresting anyone, he falls in love-with speed, adrenaline, and a bromance with Vin Diesel, the bald powerhouse who values engines more than logic. Basically, it's Point Break with chrome rims and blue neon lights under the hood.The dialogue? A mix of auto mechanic manuals and teenage trash talk. The supporting characters? As deep as an oil puddle. But let's be real-you're not here for philosophical monologues on turbochargers. You're here for insane races where drivers shift gears 14 times in 200 meters, all while smirking in the face of physics. And on that front, the movie delivers.Vin Diesel is like a tank: slow, powerful, and impossible to stop once he's rolling. The guy exudes more presence with a few grunts than some actors do with entire Shakespearean soliloquies. His Dom Toretto is part Mad Max warrior, part toxic older brother who teaches you to tune your car while dragging you into life-or-death street races.Walker plays the undercover cop who transitions from clean-cut officer to the guy who could steal your girlfriend and your car in the same night. His internal conflict? Loyalty: one day he's a cop, the next he's chugging lukewarm beers in Dom's garage, preaching the gospel of ""family forever."" But let's be honest, with that charm, he could've infiltrated any gang and gotten adopted like a lovable Labrador.Let's face it-the real stars of Fast & Furious are the cars. From souped-up Civics to iconic muscle cars, every scene is a tribute to mechanical overkill. Even when the gravity-defying stunts make you roll your eyes, you can't help but admire the spectacle, like watching a fireworks display at a cheap neighborhood fair.Fast & Furious doesn't pretend to be anything more than a motorized stress reliever. If you're hoping for introspective drama, go watch some Bergman. Here, it's all about pedal to the metal, dodging cops, and never hitting the brakes. It smells like gasoline, leather jackets, and bro-talk, but somehow, it's ridiculously fun.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

As well as being a street racer, Dom also runs a store and a garage.  His gang includes his girlfriend Lettie, younger sister Mia and friends Vince, Leon and Jessie.  Brian is drawn deeper into the glamourous world, falling for Mia and discovering a respect for Dom, which conflicts with his objectivity.Rob Cohen does an amazing job of directing this movie, even making a Hitchcock-esque cameo as a pizza delivery guy.  The film is very well acted, particularly by Vin Diesel, who manages to portray the two sided character of the carefree street-racer with the responsible older brother who looks out for Mia and the rest of his team.  His performance is by far the best of the entire film.  Apparently the character of Lettie was not in the original story and unfortunately this shows.

"Cars, speed, babes, Vin Diesel and Paul Walker","Some would love this movie, others wouldn't but you can deny The Fast and The Furious started a trend which is still on going today. Never Street Racing has been so popular since this movie came out.The street races are beautifully done and care had been applied to get the audience feeling the power and the adrenaline the pilots must feel behind the wheel of those road beasts full of NOS. There is no need to say that this is the signature of the entire series. Whatever the plot is, there is always a street race going on and each one of them is masterfully shot and scripted. This series is first of all a tribute to the cars and the driving skills of their pilots.The other asset of this movie are Vin Diesel and Paul Walker. The first one is playing Dominic Torretto, all in muscle respected and regarded as the leader of the entire LA racing community. Like her sister Mia says, everyone is attracted and orbits around Dom. Paul Walker is Brian O'Conner a promising undercover cop tasked to bring down Torretto and his team. He is definitely cute, bold and has racing in his blood. This duo are bearing the movie on their shoulders. When one is missing it has not the same impact.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
So bad it's hilarious,"""The Fast and the Furious"" is probably the best comedy of 2001. An impressive feat, considering it isn't supposed to be a comedy.Somewhere amongst all the ridiculous looking fluorescent sports cars (are these things really supposed to be ""cool""?), the inane dialogue,  the annoying music, and Paul Walker (that guy can't act his way out of a wet paper bag) we get a plot that's a complete rip-off of ""Point Break"" and racing scenes that are laughably overdone and NOT INTERESTING.Another irritating part for me (being a car nut) is the sheer ignorance of cars and of car tuning displayed in this mess. Here are a few of the things I ""learned"" from this movie:*Mazda RX-7s have six cylinder engines with overhead cams*Nitrous oxide is volatile*NOS is an acronym, and should be pronounced ""NAWWWS""*A 10 second Toyota Supra will have difficulty outrunning a 13 second Ferrari 355 but will have no trouble whatsoever keeping up with a 9 second Dodge Charger*Nitrous can ""blow the welds off"" of an intake*Mitsubishi Eclipses have 7-speed transmissions*It's possible to invest $100,000 into the engine of a Honda S2000 without putting a jet engine in it*Experienced drag racers are afraid of 9 second carsI could really go on forever, but this is just a small sampling. Maybe this film is funniest to someone with car experience, but any bad movie buff is sure to find something to love in it.1/10 (in terms of cinematic quality) 5/10 (in terms of ""Ed Wood"" quality)",5.0,Anonymous,Crime
"I Wasn't Supposed To Like This,But I Did!","Anyone who sits down to watch this movie should be looking for 2 hours of pure,forget your problems,entertainment.  Shakespeare it ain't!  However, it is a loud,action-packed diversion and it is lots of fun.  And I,being long out of my teens and a Detroit muscle car enthusiast to boot,wasn't supposed to like it!The plot is a bit on the thin side,but it is basically just an excuse to bombard the viewer with a cool,thumping soundtrack and lots of shiny,fast,little cars.  I found myself liking these characters,particularly the girls.  Both Jordana Brewster and Michelle Rodriquez did a fine job as very strong young women,each in her own way.  Vin Diesel was likeable as a character that was reminiscent of a Hollywood version of Jesse James or Robin Hood.  Paul Walker did well in his portrayal of the young undercover cop,who is torn between love and duty. I also found Chad Lindberg's portrayal of Jesse,the young genius whose potential is never fully realized,to be touching.  Certainly,having the talented Ted Levine aboard,as the voice of reason,lent an air of credibility to the whole proceedings. This man always shines,even in the smallest roles.Some of the plot was disturbing,such as the treatment of truck drivers,but it was apparent that the world of modern day street racing was well researched,by writers and actors alike.  The terminology was up to the minute and if all else fails,just holler,""NOS!""  There were definitely times that one had to suspend disbelief,but all in all,I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes cars,a flashy soundtrack and a fast-paced movie!

One of the 'better' cool car style-focused action flicks of the turn of the century,"""The Fast and The Furious"" was the ""Point Break"" of the 2000s ‚Äî a cop goes undercover to bust up a group of criminals who are into a specific ""sport,"" but he becomes attached to the very people he's trying to bust. ""Point Break"" is the better film, but ""The Fast and the Furious"" was the start of a multi-billion-dollar franchise. Go figure.Paul Walker plays the cop, Brian O'Conner, but the screenplay doesn't reveal this card until Brian has not only won the respect of top street racer Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel), but also the viewer. This small betrayal of our trust is writer Gary Scott Thompson's shrewdest move as the film goes from somewhat interesting, albeit clich√©, to more interesting, albeit clich√©.The screenplay ‚Äî co-written with Erik Bergquist and David Ayer (""Training Day"") based on the ""VIBE"" magazine article by Ken Li ‚Äî is not the focal point of the movie, of course. This was 2001, the peak of the MTV Spring Break era. The point was to show hot foreign cars, hot foreign (and American) women and a lot of burning rubber. The rock, rap and techno music of the time feature prominently, and even rapper Ja Rule had a supporting role as a racer, a reminder of how the start of the 21st century was also the beginning of the music business starting to infiltrate the movie business.All this to say, director Rob Cohen understands this is a style over substance situation. Quarter-mile races, chases, fist fights and criminal heist activity are the featured attractions ‚Äî as are the beautiful cars and beautiful people. If this film can be given any credit for originality, it belongs to the merging of heist/crime movie and drag race aesthetics. Cars had of course been featured in movies and television before, but this movie more authentically plays to the car aficionado, as a handful of films did in this era (e.g. ""Gone in 60 Seconds,"" ""The Italian Job""). There's a certain grittiness that this film has featuring real street-racing cars compared to James Bond, for example, driving something too cool to believe.The movie isn't 100 percent shallow from start to finish, however. A genuine effort is made to build chemistry between Walker and Diesel's characters. The story works best when it builds and tests that relationship. Nothing else about the movie feels worth our investment, but somehow we desperately do not want Brian and Dom to turn on each other despite all the reasons they should. Both Walker and Diesel bring likable dimensions to their characters and their chemistry is likely to be the bedrock of future films. (This coming from someone who has yet to see any of the other films yet.)The supporting cast, however, doesn't offer much. Dom's girlfriend, Letty (Michelle Rodriguez), brings nothing to the story, and the other guys in Dom's gang aren't given the chance to be anything but meatheads. The romance between Brian and Dom's sister Mia (Jordana Brewster) exists for formulaic reasons, but the fact that both of them feel kind of like outsiders to the street-racing culture gives their relationships some legitimacy.But enough about characters. ""The Fast and the Furious"" delivers some solid action sequences, especially the ones involving street cars and semi trucks. The racing scenes don't allow for much dimension, and the editing is decent to optimize suspense, but the CGI and green screen elements pull us out of what should feel like a very realistic, gritty street race.There are enough quality moments for action fans in ""The Fast and the Furious"" to overcome the MTV Spring Break music video world its characters inhabit. The 2000s were full of glossy movies with inferior story lines, and while comparing ""The Fast and the Furious"" to these films would obviously make it seem like a great movie when in fact it's an average one, it could be a suitable enough ambassador of its time and culture to movie watchers of the future.~Steven CThanks for reading!

Great Movie,"There are already a lot of comments here, so I'll keep it short, but everyone either says it sucks or it was good when you don't worry about the plot.  I went to see ""The Fast and the Furious"" with low expectations and was pleasantly surprised.  It was a magnificent movie with unquestionably fantastic special effects and stunning realism.  True if you are an actual street racer, you may see a few flaws in the realism (as happens with any movie about any non-publicized culture), but for the rest of us, it is a much needed improvement on movies like ""Gone in 60 Seconds"" (I still hate that part where Nick Cage outruns the helicopter).There is truth to the statement that this movie is very similar to ""Point Break"", though I did not notice it until it was pointed out in this site. It still has great acting and great action, not to mention a cohesive plot. I challenge those who disliked this movie to find a better action movie released this year. This is one of my new favorite movies.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
The Original and still worth the watch,"This is where it all started. The Fast and The Furious franchise has become a bit of a meme with how many there have been, but the success of the franchise owes it all to this original movie that changed the way an entire generation of men looked at cars (for better or for worse). I am not into most of the cars featured, but American Muscle makes an appearance as well in a great way. The story, the acting, the action, it is all good in this movie and it is easy to understand why the franchise has had so much success.

Good start to a great action-packed film franchise,"I love FAST AND FURIOUS movies, so I thought, ""What if I reviewed these movies?"", so I will review each film from the original film to the new film.So, I begin my second franchise review with the original 2001 film, The Fast and the Furious.The Fast and the Furious was not only released on June 22, 2001 to financial success and mixed reviews, but it also launched the careers of nearly all of it's stars, including Vin Diesel and Paul Walker, who would later become household names, as well as Jordana Brewster and Michelle Rodriguez.The film is directed by Rob Cohen with a screenplay by David Ayer, who wrote the 2001 film Training Day and co-wrote this film with two other writers including the creator of the franchise, Gary Scott Thompson.The film follows undercover cop Brian O'Conner who must stop semi-truck hijackers led by criminal and wanted fugitive Dominic Toretto from stealing expensive electronic equipment while developing a relationship with Dominic's sister, Mia Toretto and forming a friendship with Dominic.That is just a quick summary. I won't go into too much of the plot, because a lot of people should know what is the main premise of the story in this film and the other Fast and Furious movies. The franchise would later go to move away from the underground street racing plot into a plot much more cooler with the heist of $100 million dollars, gun fights and brawls and the movie that would change this franchise and bring new life into it would be the fifth entry in the series, released in April of 2011, Fast Five.The story is just really cool and amazing, but is not Oscar worthy, but the dialogue is the movie can get a little weak on a few occasions, but not throughout the whole darn movie.The action is just top-notch and the car chases in this film is as intense and action-packed as they would be later on in the franchise. My favorite car chase is at the beginning of the film and at the end of the film involving Dominic and Brian driving.The acting is just dreadful, but not all of it is. I will give credit to Vin Diesel, who plays Dominic Toretto and he pulls it off wonderfully, but while it's not Oscar worthy, he does show emotion, drama and laughter into his character. Michelle Rodriguez as Letty Ortiz, is great in this film and she would remain in that part for the other films and she would play in James Cameron's groundbreaking special-effects extravaganza Avatar and in the 2002 action-horror / zombie movie film based on the survival video game, Resident Evil.The other two that also does a great job is definitely Paul Walker and Jordana Brewster, who plays Brian O'Conner and Mia Toretto, and they do a very decent good job with the material written for them and they have such a great chemistry on the screen.Dominic Toretto's team members are just good. The actors who play the people in his crew is just incredible, with the exception of Matt Schulze as Vince.The music and soundtrack is really cool and Ja Rule is in this film, playing the role of Edwin and he provides music on the soundtrack.Overall, The first and original FAST AND THE FURIOUS is really good, but can get a little confusing in a few areas. I give it a 6 out of 10. It's not the best score, but certainly not the worst. This film is worth the watch and worth buying on DVD and Blu-Ray or watching on basic cable and Video on Demand or Xfinity Streampix.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime

Dumb- and proud!,"The Fast and The Furious is one of the most unapologetically stupid movies to come along in a while.  It's about a bunch of drag racers, but really, it's all about the drag racing itself.  The filmmakers know this, so they spent all their time on that stuff, and basically ignored usually important elements like plot, conflict, and dialogue.  The result is a movie that is extremely watchable, but nevertheless very, very dumb.If you care about plot, you obviously are thinking too hard at this movie. Still, TF&TF is about a few drag racers, led by Turetto (Vin Diesel), who gets mixed up with new kid on the block Brian (Paul Walker).  We quickly learn Brian's a cop, looking for some guys who rip off semi trucks while they are driving.  Anyway, by the end of the movie the film is so wrapped up in thrills and big explosions and things smashing into one another, it basically gives up on the plot, doesn't bother resolving several of the conflicts (Including Brian's weird love interest with Turetto's sister).The acting and dialogue are truly laughably bad.  When Vin Diesel says a line like ""I live my life a quarter mile at a time...for those ten seconds or less, I'm free."" I certainly laugh-how does he keep a straight face? These are lines that porn actors would have trouble delivering straight! Diesel is ideal for this role; he's physically intimidating (Paul Walker looks downright wussy next to him) and his no-emotion acting style really allows him to say stuff that other actors might actually think about when they delivered them and realize just how stupid they were going to sound.Still, the racing stuff is very exciting, and a heist involving an angry truck driver is truly thrilling (Even though I didn't care one iota about who lived or who died).  Even though there's a big plot hole in that scene, it'll be hours before you realize it.  The conclusion is exciting AND humorous; yet makes absolutely no sense whatsoever.  This film is in-the-moment enjoyable, groan-worthy in retrospect.Rob Cohen, director of the atrocious Daylight, and the slightly-less-atrocious, but still-pretty-horrible The Skulls, is a little better here, wisely avoiding to bathe all his pretty characters in golden halos of backlight and instead going for a much more realistic look.  He's probably aided by the exciting material not the other way around.  I'm still not convinced he's a good director.Anyway, sad to say, I enjoyed this movie far more than just about any other action movie this summer...as lame as it is, it stays fairly enjoyable throughout.  In a lot of places, the car-chase free parts stay fun cause the people talking sound so completely stupid.  I laughed, I was entertained, I wished there were more movies out like Memento.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
great action cant save a crumbling script,"Welcome to the world of street racing. Fast sleek car, hot women, and lots and lots of money. The man everyone looks to is Dominic, but he is being put under investigation by undercover cop Brian. There have been hijackers robbing trucks of their merchandise and Dominic is the main suspect. Though Brian is on the case, his judgment is clouded when he befriends Dom, but more to when he becomes infatuated by Dom's sister Mia.The Fast and the Furious is a head first trip into the world of underground street racing; but the film doesn't do it justice. It doesn't explore the notion of why people do it and just shows us that street racers are petty crimes looking for a break. The plotting is paper thin and the dialog is so hammed; they sound childish. The guys gruff their way through not showing much intelligence and the girls are given this fragile ego. All the actors try to look tuff but they don't show any sign of intimidation. The have surly looks but are giant pussy cats. They should have gotten lesson from Clint Eastwood on how to be a tough guy.Rob Cohen, though not a favourite director, does have en eye for action sequences. Most of the time his direction is very heavy handed, but when the action starts he is in his foray. The action is high energy and come at a relentless pace. He does get you right in the middle of it. Though the problem is that it doesn't keep its impact over time. Once you've seen it a few times the car chases don't really have the same intensity they had when you first saw it.It fast and has a very slick look to it, but with a script lacking development and very mediocre acting, not even the good car chases can save it from it plot holes.",5.0,Anonymous,Crime

It could be very good,"I was attracted to the movie by its unexpectedly strong box office score and the fact that I was a hard core street racer some years back.The excellent: I would rate the street racing scenes are among the best of all times. The needed improvement: The technology stuffs are too domestic and simple. I don't see other countries' street racers (Japanese, Europeans...) using nitros and decide a driver's ability on a straight line race but the states. If they can make the races from point A to B (non-straight line) and focus more on how handling tuning is as important as horsepower, the ability of the 'well respected' group leader and the undercover would become more persuasive. Conclusion: If you are a hard core racing fan, this movie could disappoint as it did to me. The movie plot is really poor.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Shallow as hell, but fun to watch","If you watch The Fast and the Furious for the script and the acting, you will be disappointed. This movie has no intention of being a Michael Mann-like philosophical action movie. It's just a silly ride that will entertain for a couple of hours without any real emotional impact on the viewer. I knew this right from the start, which is why I enjoyed The Fast and the Furious.Actually, I'm being a bit unfair, since there is one respectable performance in the film: Vin Diesel's career-making portrayal of Dominic Toretto, who is the undisputed king of L.A.'s illegal street racing. That is, until a cocky guy named Brian (Paul Walker) shows up to challenge him. Naturally, Dom wins, but in the meantime he's made friends with the newcomer, who saves his life when the cops show up.As we learn soon after-wards, though, it's all a set-up: Brian is a cop himself, going undercover to find out whether Dom is involved in a series of truck hijackings.In the hands of a better director, the movie could have been an interesting character study, with the addition of a few mandatory action sequences. Rob Cohen, however, treats the script like an excuse to stage a bunch of visually spectacular race scenes. Those scenes, as well as Diesel's charismatic presence, make The Fast and the Furious fun enough to watch, but not good enough to remember. In fact, there aren't enough elements to justify the film's transformation into a franchise. But focusing on these aspects is pointless: just take the movie for what it is (a good-looking, if shallow summer blockbuster) and enjoy it. Otherwise, watch something better.7,5/10",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

But came away with a feeling of, well, not quite satisfaction, but definitely not discomfort as the haters (aka Internet movie nerds and ""critics"") bring forth in their reviews.Sure there is action, explosions, chases, hot chicks, etc. but that's to be expected from a film called ""The Fast and the Furious."" Indeed, it is fast with its MTV style editing with furious undertones of rage and violence and crime, but hey, it's a movie about criminal car racers for crying out loud.Yes the visuals are impressive and the sound is good too. The editing, lighting, cinematography and all the other technicals are well done. The acting...not so well done but not awful - there really isn't a whole lot, nor dialogue for that matter. But what makes the story compelling is its (simple yes, but intriguing nevertheless) character relationships which form the plot.Is this film over the top? Yes. But it is done in such a way that keeps you interested, and besides, since so few of us actually do know about the undercover world of streetcar racing, who are we to say what is real and what isn't? Besides, if you haven't been paying attention, this film is a male fantasy - muscles, guns, money, cars, women...like every other video on MTV (which explains the annoying soundtrack).This film is not a great movie, but it has no pretense of being one, and that is refreshing when so much crap out there does. It is a popcorn flick, instantly forgettable but watchable over and over nonetheless. Plus, watch the DVD extras as to how some impressive stunts were done, and your appreciation for this film will grow.OVERALL RATING: 6 of 10 stars.

Fast Cars And Those Who Drive Them,"I had just come from a rather desultory day at the movies where I saw the sequel Fast & Furious to this film. I had written in the review that you probably would have had to see the first film in order to fully appreciate what was going on. Wouldn't you know it, the FX channel was broadcasting this tonight.I was partially correct, but this film had a bit more plot to it and didn't concentrate on just the special effects and the violence which was served up fast and furious. Vin Diesel is a criminal who races cars as an avocation and does hijackings for a living. The FBI wants him, the LAPD wants him and Paul Walker is an LAPD cop gone undercover to get him.Walker takes his assignment quite literally and part of getting undercover is under some blankets with Diesel's sister Jordana Brewster and getting it on with the young lady. But he also proves his driving abilities to Diesel.Diesel's racing rivals are some Asian gangbangers headed by Rick Yune and Walker would dearly like to pin something on them. Still it's Diesel his superiors want and it's Diesel they will have come what may.Paul Walker compromised his effectiveness as an undercover agent thoroughly in this film. In fact at the beginning of the sequel it is remarked that he's lucky to still be holding a job.

Not really all that good.,"Last year I rented FAST FIVE despite not really caring about the previous flicks. I had only seen the first film when it came out and some of TOKYO DRIFT on TV. I gave the fifth film a shot anyway because the trailers made it look really fun and it got good word of mouth. To my surprise, I enjoyed it. It was a nice fun stunt car heist flick with no pretensions of being anything other than it was.So here I am, watching the first film and I quickly realize why I didn't embrace the series during its initial films. This first installment is basically POINT BREAK with cars, but without The Buse. The first race is pretty fun at first but after that it just didn't do much for me.

"A fun, if brainless, start to a successful franchise","Never in a million years would I, sitting in the cinema (with my mum and stepfather, oddly enough) back in 2001, think that the auto-porn I had just witnessed would kick-start a hugely successful franchise due it's seventh instalment next year in 2015. Not that I didn't enjoy the 90 minutes of homoerotic machismo, endless gear-stick changes, scantily-clad gyrators and a cameo by Ja Rule - I actually found it highly entertaining in a Point Break (1991) sort-of-way - it's just that how much of an audience can a film about cars draw? Lots, it would seem.Undercover L.A.P.D. officer Brian O'Connor (Paul Walker) is assigned to infiltrate a gang of street-racers led by the notorious Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) after a series of high-speed truck hijackings using pimped-out Honda Civics. A highly competent driver himself, Brian uses his skills to befriend Dominic, while falling for his sister Mia (Jordana Brewster). After saving Dominic from the police, Brian earns his respect but not that of his crew, and when Dominic proves himself generous and loyal to those who offer him the same, Brian must choose between protecting his new friend and arresting the criminal he has been assigned to bring down.The Fast and the Furious' script is often bad enough to make your ears bleed. This is a film where words of wisdom are offered in the form of ""it's not how you stand by your car, it's how you race your car,"". But it's delivers on what the title promises, and the action scenes are well-staged and it's nice to see real metal bend and break in an increasingly CGI-reliant marketplace. It's loud and often crude, but the two leads of obvious limited acting range prove likable and actually generate some chemistry. It's difficult to say where the franchise will go after the sad death of Paul Walker last year, but this first instalment was a fun, if brainless, start.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
"A fun, fast action flick with all the right components","A fresh approach on the classic action flick, complete with fist fights, exploding cars and scantily dressed women.  While it's not Oscar material, it's a fun, fast ride with simple, likable characters easy to root for and exciting to watch.  Vin Diesel's performance is one of the film's highlights along with the heart-pounding effects and action sequences.  While the plot is a bit thin, the film delivers what it promises and doesn't profess to be something it's not.  I liked it enough to buy the DVD and I've watched it several times.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Hondas suck... And so does this movie...,"Movies that rely on subcultures and pop culture are generally the bottom of the barrel... the Fast and the Furious does nothing to change this it only makes me want to vomit. The average joe will watch this and enjoy because the average joe likes Hondas with NOS and pink neon. I cant stand to see the the tuner culture exposed in such a way that glorifies the idea of throwing tons of cash into cars with little to no potential. This film grossly augments the ability of a V-TEC and NOS. Yeah, okay this film was not supposed to be realistic but it is so ridiculous that I can't even pretend to enjoy. The plot is this: an undercover cop tries to bust a theft ring by entering the underworld of compact car racing. The cop meets people, races, and tries to look cool... it is horrible to watch...painful. The plot is ho-hum the acting is humorous and the races are bullcrap. At one point there is a supra that races a Ferrari...and wins. like I said before this is too ridiculous to praise.

May not be quite what you were expecting!,"This review is intended for people who haven't seen the movie and are considering buying the DVD.The best advice I can offer is simply this:  If you haven't seen the movie yet and are considering buying the DVD, DON'T.  Not until you rent it first.I won't go off and say that this movie is either bad or great.  Everyone needs to decide that for themselves.  However, as a word of caution, it may not be what you expected.  Here's what I found.Before renting the DVD last weekend, I had considered buying it for 2 reasons:1)  Vin Diesel is one of the best new actors and I liked him in his previous films.2)   I am a former high school drag racer and still love fast cars.Based on the previews and the promos for the movie, I had thought that Vin played the main character.  I was wrong.  Unfortunately, Paul Walker gets substantially more screen time and the movie is really about his character, not Vin's.  One thing I think everyone can agree on:  Paul Walker is no Vin Diesel!!!! Additionally, there really isn't as much action as you would think.  As some other reviewers have mentioned, there is a substantial amount of screen time spent with the actors standing around the cars and talking smack.  There's also an unconvincing love story (which eats up the minutes) between Paul Walker's character and the sister of Vin's character.As a result, I'm glad I didn't blow the $20 to buy it.  One viewing was plenty for me.  However, it wasn't a waste of time either.Overall, I gave the movie 6 out of 10 stars.  It wasn't nearly as good as I was expecting, but it also wasn't trash.  Sure, it's a familiar story that's been done several times before, and better, but in general I try not to let previous versions of a story influence me.  I try to let each movie stand on its own merits.I hope you find this helpful.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
Cool,"To me this movie was kinda cool, because it shows some reality of what happens in the races that they actually have.

Fast Paced action,"The one that started it all, The original Fast and the Furious is a movie that I think is often forgotten. Fans and casual viewers alike think of the extremely over the top impossible action sequences the newer Furious movies have become. But few remember that once upon a time, it was about street racing and boosting trucks.While it is essentially a Point Break remake with cars instead of surfers, the Fast and the Furious manages to stand on its own and be a thoroughly entertaining movie. The dialogue is pretty stupid at times and some stuff that happens doesn't always make sense, but the movie never fails to entertain.The Fast and the Furious is probably too good to be considered a guilty pleasure, but too bad to be considered a great movie, so I'll just say, even if it's stupid at times, and over the top, The Fast and The Furious is without a doubt a very entertaining movie I really enjoy watching every once in a while.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Big, dumb, fast and fun","Big dumb fast and fun.I was talking with a friend of mine who is into customizing cars  - he has a gorgeous Honda Accord that has a new addition every time I see him - when I saw the first trailers for this movie.  We agreed that there would be some great cars, gorgeous women, awesome racing sequences and people condemning the film for irresponsibly promoting street racing.  All our suspicions proved correct, but most surprising was the lateness of the negative publicity for the film - I didn't see an article until today (interesting side note, the author had been cruising the international custom car bulletin boards for weeks trying to get interviews, but no one would bite).Blond haired blue-eyed Brian Spindler is sent to find the people responsible for several precision big rig hijackings.  He searches for his quarry among the street racing gangs of LA, where he meets and tries to ingratiate himself with Dominic Torreto, the prince of the racing set.  Brian soon finds himself in the middle of a bubbling gang war, and is being pressured by his superiors to get a bust. Things get complicated when Brian finds himself falling for Dominic's sister and at odds with the other members of Dom's crew.  But just when he thinks things can't get any worse, Brian gets an unpleasant surprise.I'm not going to rave about an intricate plot, zippy well scripted dialogue or in-depth character studies, because they simply aren't present, indeed there are several laughingly bad lines, and the acting is generally subpar This film is about action, and the sequences are some of the best to grace the movie screen  in a long time:  the driving is phenomenal, that stunts are amazing (no digital enhancement here) and the cars are very impressive. Although the film is a little over the top in some aspects - not every car customizer uses Nitrous Oxide or races their cars (most would be terrified that they might scratch or god forbid crash, their cars)- I think they have managed to capture the spirit of this unique subculture.   The acting is definitely a mixed bag.I've enjoyed Vin Diesel's roles, even though I've not been that enamoured of the films he's been in.  In a recent interview, he explained that he's drawn to anti-heroes as he finds them more interesting than the white shirted good guys, and I tend to agree with his observations.  As Diesel recently stated, Dominic is a man of his word, who believes in honor, but happens to ""live outside the law"" and his is the only character that is adequately fleshed out in the film.   Paul Walker plays Brian as possibly the most inept undercover cop to grace the screen - the only way he could stand out more in the group he's trying to infiltrate would be to wear a Village People costume.  Donnie Brasco he ain't.   This is exacerbated by the fact that Walker's portrayal is virtually bereft of any real emotion, and his soulless delivery of several corny lines renders them even worse than they were written- quite a feat.  The biggest disappointment for me was the waste of Michelle  Rodriguez - who distinguished herself in ""Girl Fight"" - whose soul purpose is to linger on screen and scowl.  A tremendous waste of a valuable commodity.If you're looking for a punchy matinee, without a lot of dialogue or plot to get in the way, settle in for the ride.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Shallow movie about hot cars and girls - big problem: they get the ""cars"" part completely wrong!","OK, I get it, the movie is only to show hot cars and girls, so I won't comment on the thin, improbable and hole-riddled plot. Instead I'm going to list just a few thing that are wrong about the cars in the movie, which I'm guessing was designed for viewers who largely have no clue about cars, maybe because the target audience is slightly too young to drive, i.e. early teens? Well, here goes: 1. NOS seems to be the solution to everything. There is a lot more involved to make a car go fast, yet the shop is full of NOS, NOS, and more NOS parts! Oh, and exhausts, because everyone knows loud exhausts are the 2nd most important thing that makes a car go fast ;-) 2. The car ""tops out at 140"", let's add some NOS (surprise!) and it'll go faster. If your car tops out at 140, NOS will not help you one bit. Maybe you're running out of gears, maybe the engine should be built for higher revs, but NOS won't change anything about your top speed! 3. The best qualities of the type of cars driven, modern Japanese cars, are cornering and handling. What do they do? They have a drag race on a straight instead - wrong car for this purpose, any average US muscle car will beat the hell out of the Jappa there with less money spent on it (and conversely, a modern Japanese car will leave an average old US muscle car in the dust in an actual race involving lots of corners).4. Double-clutching ... oh dear, what a complete and utter nonsense! You double-clutch if you have an unsynchronized transmission - very unlikely - and even then only when you down-shift (which you never do in a drag race!) 5. 140mph is fast at the end of a quarter mile, but not that fast in principle, there are *many* European and Japanese cars that have a top speed around that figure or higher, even ""family cars"".6. Nitrous oxide doesn't run out after a few seconds (lines in the movie indicate a racer has used his NOS boost ""too early"").7. If Vin is serious about drag racing, he wouldn't have a sound system weighing a ton in his car. Note, there's a scene where the geek is explaining how to save 2-3kg of weight on the car they're building later on, so on the other hand they do seem to be interested in saving weight.8. Towards the end, Vin drives the Charger and does a monstrous wheelie. You don't get that kind of traction/wheelie on anything but big fat racing slicks, yet the car has pretty normal tires on it.9. While we're at it - the tires are smoking while he does a wheelie?! Wheelie means you have grip. Smoking tires means you don't have grip. Which is it?!? 10. A car like that Charger would definitely have a wheelie bar, especially since a wheelie as big and exaggerated as the one shown in the movie would just cost you time.11. If you're serious about 1/4 mile times, you're not going to drive a FWD car, but rather a RWD or 4WD car.12. Surely even the boy-racer scene with Jappa cars finds cheap stickers tacky (no pun intended) and would opt for real airbrush or pin-striping on their prized cars (there is one scene where they put decorative stickers(!) on a car).13. Why would you rebuild a burnt out Supra?! Apparently their labor is free and restoring the car is done in a leisurely afternoon or something. Oh, and the engine is so special that $15k turns it into a 10s car! These are just off the top of my head, and I'm not even that knowledgeable about cars myself, so I'm sure there's plenty more wrong. The movie doesn't pretend to be anything it isn't, but at least they should have gotten the ""car"" parts right in what is meant to be a car movie! ...or did I get that wrong and I just watched a very long commercial for NOS (which is a brand name ;-) ?",3.0,Anonymous,Crime

Unreasonably because there's already a lot of warning signs in this starter film - which is meant to be one of the bright spots in this decalogy - as no character is really given an identity apart from Paul Walker and Vin Diesel, the music cues are unmistakably 2001, and the most compelling story beats are given no conclusive explanation, just left to the dust as another neon-coloured attack to your eyes veers offscreen.

The start of it all,"Fast and Furious. The first one. This film came out a month before I was born, and I've only just watched now in 2018. Do I like it? Does it hold up? Let me explain.
Ever since I can remember, I've been into cars. Always have, always will be. Now, when Hollywood tries to make a film about car culture, did they get it right? Sort of.
This movie has so much good about it. The story is just solid. Car guys and girls just being themselves, sticking together. Lets you know a bit of what its like to have a crew. All the cars are iconic. Dom's Black Dodge Charger and Red Mazda RX-7, Brian's Orange Toyota Supra and Green Mitsubishi Eclipse. So many other cars that back in the day and even today look absurd with the styling and parts, but are classics because of the movies that made them. And this movie started all of it. You can't talk about tuner culture or drag racing or even Paul Walker without bringing this film up. This film had its rough spots, but those imperfections are what make this film so iconic and loved.
So, did Hollywood make a car film true to the culture? It's 50/50. They got the racing and the tuning and the whole feel of the scene, but also added in the heists and back turning that is so classic Hollywood. This film is classic, and still means something to me today.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime

A racing movie with slight depth,"Rating-6/10The Fast and Furious is a racing movie, with crime, that also serves thrills and spills all over the workshop. This is the kind of movie we so often dislike but for me, this isn't dislikeable and is actually an OK piece of film, a kind of ""give it a go"" kind of movie. The whole show is pretty well made and no one can deny the stunts involved aren't fantastically done, and the plot is actually not half bad at all.Brian O'Conner(Paul Walker) is a cop racing in street races, trying to infiltrate racing gangs and the like, and to be fair Walker does it kind of nicely. I did feel out of the main cast that Walker feels the most uncomfortable, but he still manages to lead the movie out well enough. Vin Diesel as the gang leader Dominic is OK too, he actually outshines everybody here and his acting skill really comes through for me here, proves what he has in the locker.Rob Cohen directs this a bit OK, not great but he steadies it, the film could have been more on point at times but nevertheless he still catches the right feeling the script gives off. And on that note the film Is written much the same, missed opportunities here and there and massive cheesy lines can harm it, but I think by the end of the story, your hooked on the adrenaline junkie action, rather than the wording choices.The movie has a glitzy look about it, this is Hollywood through and through and yet that doesn't matter, it feels raw enough to be believable and the stars of the movie are not famous enough for this to be yet another big budget action thriller movie, that tries too hard to be cool. The cars are for me not that nice, the one thing that really gets annoying after a while is bright green cars etc with racing stripes of fire, the cars go fast and this is good for petrol heads, but the look of it is pretty awful.I said about the stunts and there is no denying the stunts are good, there not gravity defying like so many of the sequels(Fast and Furious 7 has just left cinemas at the time of this review), they are well done and basic, sure the effects used in the cars whilst racing is ridiculous, but the fast crashes and kind of crazy things that go on, make this exciting and personally I enjoyed it quite a little bit.You know I hear a lot of people claim this is ""only for the boys"", but please disregard that, not only it being sexist but also that this actually contains depth in the story, not just mindless racing. I mean the depth is pretty high up, this only just scrapes the surface but it still has more than the cars. I felt the plot which I will not ruin for those who haven't seen, is good and it makes this kinda fun but at the same time thrilling, you honestly don't know what will happen, and although the story does play out rather basic, It still contains a fun story.Overall this is one fast paced movie I can recommend, now don't be won over by it like so many can, this honestly isn't a masterpiece of any kind, but still worth a view. I didn't feel bored at any times, all my focus was on the characters and how they develop and I think that you too can enjoy it, If you focus on one particular part, and not the cheese that this movie truly is.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
Rip off that ends up paying off,"Okay, like the trivia says, this one is too close to Kathryn Bigelow's Point Break. The plot is virtually the same.

"Simple plot, average acting but still entertains","The Fast and the Furious is an action film directed by Rob Cohen and stars Late Paul Walker, Vin Diesel, Michelle Rodriguez, Jordana Brewster, Rick Yune, Chad Lindberg, Johnny Strong, and Ted Levine.The movie is first installment of fast and furious franchise.This movie is considered as one of the best movie of the franchise and i also watched the movie with lots of expectations but was subtly unsatisfied primarily due to the plot which is very simple it's execution which is straight and the acting as apart from Walker most of the characters were not up-to the mark.Plot of the movie is very simple and very predictable and will not offer you anything exciting in terms of any twists or turns but since the movie is on car races it has a fast screenplay and the viewers might not get distracted.The acting is average and apart from Paul Walker no one is that impressive, Vin Diesel was average and barring few scenes was majorly flat faced, Michelle Rodriguez had featured in few action movies and she is quite similar to another action movies she had featured in, rest of the cast were similar and acting was either average or below par.

The Fast and the Furious (2001) When everything was simpler,"The first film in the Fast and Furious franchise is much simpler than the later ones. Here, the film focuses on something much less megalomaniacal and seeks to explore only street racing. The simplicity of the script is what makes this first film good. As much as the script is flawed when it comes to the police investigation, this doesn't sound like a problem. At no point does the film propose to be an investigation like Se7en. The focus here is entirely on the action. The setting makes the FBI plot consistent with the rest of the story. At no point does the film require an Oscar-worthy performance from the characters, so Vin Diesel and Paul Walker manage to deliver a good job, precisely because they are just charismatic and get along well. The first film in the franchise is good for not trying to be more than it is. He does what he sets out to do and does it effectively.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

The Title Says It All,"I won't go into a long drawn out review of this film. The Fast and the Furious is just what it means. You have extremely fast sporty cars racing furiously down public streets. The plot is pretty irrelevant, but if you must know, think of this as Point Break on wheels instead of on a surf board and you'll know what I mean. Paul Walker does an admirable job in this flick, but doesn't really sell his character as an undercover cop. True..no one would ever believe he's a real cop, but even when he's acting like a cop, it's not convincing. Vin Diesel does a great job as Dominic Toretto. His deep voice and statured physic fits him perfectly for this role. This guy could be the next Arnold S. with the right script. He was sensational in Pitch Black, and just as good in The Iron Giant (voice of Iron Giant). This guy is going to go far.As for the movie, it was what I expected. Lots of fast cars, crazy chases, sexy women, and timely stunts. The plot is forgettable, but the action will be remembered.

A High-Octane Masterpiece,"Buckle up, because ""The Fast and the Furious"" is a high-octane joyride that will leave you breathless from start to finish. This 2001 cinematic gem, directed by Rob Cohen, is not just a movie; it's a pulse-pounding adrenaline rush that defined a generation of action films. From the screeching tires to the heart-stopping races, this film takes you on a thrilling journey through the underground world of street racing in Los Angeles.One of the strongest aspects of this film is its gripping storyline. The narrative is tightly woven, keeping the audience engaged right from the opening scene. The characters are well-developed, each with their unique personalities and motivations, adding depth to the overall story. Moreover, the film expertly explores themes of loyalty, friendship, and the blurred lines between right and wrong, making it more than just a typical action movie.The races in this film are nothing short of spectacular. The choreography and attention to detail in these sequences are astonishing, making every gear shift and nitrous boost feel incredibly real. The adrenaline-fueled races are complemented by a heart-pounding soundtrack that perfectly captures the intensity of the moment, enhancing the overall viewing experience.The cast delivers outstanding performances across the board. Vin Diesel shines as Dominic Toretto, exuding charisma and intensity in every scene. Paul Walker, as Brian O'Conner, delivers a compelling performance, capturing the struggle between duty and friendship flawlessly. The chemistry between the cast members is palpable, adding authenticity to their relationships and making the emotional moments resonate even more.In addition to its gripping story and thrilling races, ""The Fast and the Furious"" is a testament to great filmmaking. The direction is sharp, the cinematography is dynamic, and the editing is slick, creating a visually stunning movie-going experience.

A rebuttal of Theo Robertson's critique.,"The user comments by 36-year-old Theo Robertson of Isle of Bute, Scotland, are sort of valid, although he is very dismissive and critical of TFATF's plot and ""product placement.""  Like it's a bad thing.  Perhaps living on an island in Scotland does not equip one to understand or fairly ""criticise"" a southern Californian car-cult movie.  And he's 36, ""...too old to enjoy TFATF by about...oh, twenty years?""  I am 61 and I thought it was a fun movie.  In New Mexico, we know A LOT about custom cars, low-riders and high-riders, and we understand how (and WHY)one might put tens of thousands of dollars into creating a really boss machine.  Sure, TFATF is pure science fiction, the science being the cars and the fiction being the likelihood of scores of custom race car afficionados being able to commandeer a ""deserted"" street for a midnight race.  But yes, the car cult does cross race and ethnic lines, because it's all about the cars....  And so what if the film has a lot of ""product placement""?  Personally, I didn't even understand half of what the characters were talking about when it came to custom engine parts.  The movie does one thing very well:  it entertains.  Obviously. There's a very successful sequel out now.  Compared to other movies in its sub-genre, The Fast and The Furious deserves an 8 or 9.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

The music by BT is another thing that fits well in the movie, as well as the songs. They give us the music theme of tuned car racing.

A perfect metaphor for L.A...,"In that this film can be described in three simple words: Big, Loud and above all, Pointless.The story was barely beyond one-dimensional (the ending was so so telegraphed, it defies description) as was the acting. Paul Walker find another profession or you will end in the roles that Wings Hauser would turn down.On the upside, there were the car stunts, which were stunning and my marks for this film is because of those stunts only.2 out of 10 for the stunts. A flat zero for everything else.",2.0,Anonymous,Crime
I enjoyed it...,"Okay, here we go.  I like to consider myself and intelligent individual, so when I was reading comments I was surprised to see such things as "" if you have an IQ of over 80 stay away from this film"" and other comments like ""the film spent too much money on the cars and couldn't afford good actors"" (or something to that notion...).  I personally am the type of person that appreciates a good film with a good story line, great actors, and deep underlying concepts.. but give me a break.  Not every movie is made for that reason.  The reason I enjoyed The Fast and the Furious is quite simple... it has something for everyone... well, almost everyone, there are always the people who can find something wrong with it.  It has fast cars, actors people like to see on the screen along with some fresh faces, characters that people identify with, and an action packed storyline.  What more could you want?  Some say the dialogue wasn't so great... okay, what exactly would you say when you wanted the tuna fish sandwich?  The dialogue fit in with the situations they were in... you couldn't expect more.  So, to sum it up, I liked the Fast and the Furious for the simple reason that it was an enjoyable, action packed film with likeable actors and dream-like cars.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
The king of the car films??,"SOME SPOILERS CONTAINED!The fast and the furious.... If this title is told many people think about the coolest film on earth, the greatest cars and the greatest drivers. I don't know yet why though.I am personally into cars. I'm also interested in mechanics and electronics in general and I do know about that topic so don't tell me I have no clue what I'm going to talk about.The film is made for 6-year-olds. There are ""cool"" (in my point of view pretty stupid) paint jobs, roaring engines and of course NO2! And then there is Vin Diesel who plays cocky Torreto. So they race illegally and the young cop is sent out to investigate the racing.The racing is nothing spectacular. 400 meters straight line, the best built car wins or whose engine can manage the most turbo pressure or nitrous in other words. In total there are only few races throughout the whole film and it's rather boring to watch them. The cars the characters are racing could not be as powerful as real drag racing cars so the handling should be relatively easy as well. That fact already doesn't make the racers heroes in front of my eyes.But racing is acceptable. The worst part of the movie is Torreto's gang truck robbing. It is so unrealistic and stupid that I don't have words for it. Every thinking person can understand how lame it looks. You can't hold on the truck with nothing to worry about when a truck is traveling about 100 km/h. And just how it looks. Truck drivers don't really do anything to get rid of them except the last one who starts shooting the gang.And finally the whole story limps. It's very stereotypical and overall boring. I'm not gonna spoil too much but basically the undercover working cop merges into Torreto's gang and eventually starts defending Torreto. In the end he still founds out that Torreto is involved to truck robbing and tries to put the end to that. He also flirts with Torreto's sister. Some gang members speculate he's a cop but Torreto doesn't take that seriously etc. In other words quite boring story.All in all I'd say that Fast and furious is a weak movie, unrealistic and quite boring. I don't know how this movie is so highly respected because for me it really doesn't look anything special.2/10",1.0,Anonymous,Crime
