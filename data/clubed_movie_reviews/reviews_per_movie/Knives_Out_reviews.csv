Lots of Nice Little Twists,"No, it wasn't perfect. No it was not Academy Award material. But it was a delightful story with lots of classic whodunnit elements. I thought we got to know each character well and, like in an Agatha Christie novel, fulfilled their roles. I thought Craig did a nice job and kept things moving along. Plummer was good in his limited screen time. Once again, I'm so fed up with people who decide that IMDB presents an opportunity to destroy a valid system by giving a movie such as this a rating of One. Do you really think this film ranks down there with Alligator Women on Venus. That's what the One ratings are for. It's usually because a film gets a little hype and those with no imagination or who are unhappy with their lives feel the need to throw everything off. Use lower ratings, but try to show some objectivity.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Bringing back the classic whoddunit in amazingly entertaining fashion - 8/10 ‚≠ê,"What an excellent film byRian Johnson; definitely feels like the film he was destined to make. Writing that is slick as hell, sublime performances (most notably Daniel Craig who brings his A-game in a wonderfully charismatic turn), superb editing and wonderfully atmospheric music - all tied together by masterful direction. Will probably be among the most fun you have at a theatre this year and fans of Agatha Christie and old murder mystery stories will have plenty to love here - a nostalgically entertaining time!",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Pimp My Agatha Christie!,"With the exception of my wife and daughter, and possibly my mother, Agatha Christie is the woman whom I love most on this planet. She truly was the most gifted and brilliant fiction writer who ever lived, and it rejoices me to see that her work still inspires other writers and filmmakers nowadays; more than forty years after she passed away. There are still many adaptations of her original work, but with ""Knives Out"", writer/director Rian Johnson attempts something entirely different. It's abundantly clear that Johnson was inspired by all of Christie's typical trademarks and hobby-horses, and he pays tribute to her most legendary characters and favorite settings, but the plot of ""Knives Out"" is entirely new and scripted directly for the screen. A good old-fashioned murder mystery/whodunit set in the enormous mansion of a wealthy family, full of eccentric people each of whom have dirty little secrets, convoluted plot twists, continuous red herrings that practically make it impossible to guess along, and a fabulous all-knowing but slightly odd sleuth slowly unravelling the clues.Daniel Craig is downright terrific as Benoit Blanc, a private detective with a bizarre accent and weird one-liners, hired by someone anonymous to dig deeper into the strange and sudden death of patriarch Harlan Thrombey. It looks like suicide, but literally every greedy member of Harlan's bloodline had a motive for killing and - also in delightful Agatha Christie tradition - the plot even thickens after the reading of the will. It would be a shame to reveal too much about the plot, but rest assured that is refreshing and inventive, compelling as well as humorous, complex but simultaneously light-headed and 200% entertaining. The cast is phenomenal. Craig clearly enjoyed depicting a heroic protagonist that is the complete opposite of his James Bond character, and the Thrombey family exclusively exists of great talents, including Jamie Lee Curtis, Michael Shannon, Toni Colette, Christopher Plummer and Don Johnson. ""Knives Out"" is perhaps slightly too long, but never tedious, and very well-directed by Rian Johnson (who honestly doesn't deserve all this hatred from disappointed ""Star Wars"" geeks)",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Hated Last Jedi. Loved this.,"As a fan of mysteries (Sherlock Holmes, Poirot, Columbo, Monk, Psych.etc.) I was thrilled to see someone making a classic style whodunnit...and the cast! Figure you can't go wrong. Well I enjoyed it & while the cast all have time to shine it is Daniel Craig with his Southern drawl & especially Ana de Armas that steal the show. For anyone keeping away because they hated The Last Jedi...I agree, it was my least favourite of all the Star Wars films, but this is a well written film that was well acted and I can only hope this will inspire others to reinvigorate the murder mystery genre.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Well worth tucking into,"It was very hard to say no to watching 'Knives Out' and it was one of my most anticipated films since it came out. It was due to being busy and personal problems that stopped me from seeing it sooner. A lot drew me in to watching it. Absolutely love murder mysteries and seeing a lot of comparisons to one of my favourite authors Agatha Christie and the starry cast were reasons enough for me to see it, as well as the great reviews.Found myself really enjoying, if not quite loving, 'Knives Out'. Can understand why it may not be for all, if one doesn't like seeing and hearing the truth much earlier on than they would expect, and it is easy to see the ridiculing for Daniel Craig's Southern accent (which is admittedly atrocious). Can totally understand its appeal and why it was so positively received though, because to me it was a well made, well acted and cleverly written film that shows that director Rian Johnson does have a great film in him. While not perfect or one of the best films ever made (though was not expecting 'The Godfather' or 'Casablanca' etc), it is a long way from being a 1/10 film, putting it down there with most of the films riffed on MST3K, films from SyFy and the Asylum, 'Home Alone 4', 'NeverEnding Story 3', 'Titanic: The Animated Movie' and the Baby Geniuses films is insulting. As far as 2019 goes, it is towards being one of the better films of that year if not one of the very best.'Knives Out' had potential to be even better than it was. If it didn't overdo or repeat too much the vomiting running gag and slowed the final solution down (a suitably complicated one that is explained a little too fast for my liking) it would have been a better film.Wouldn't have said no to the truth (well some of it was) being revealed later than it was, though even when it was placed when it was it was still in the final solution not at all what things initially seemed. The film is a little overlong as well.However, so much works here. 'Knives Out' looks great, full of atmospheric colour, beautiful locations (the interiors of the house are especially atmospheric), stylishly photographed and slickly edited. Nathan Johnson's score has menace and energy, without feeling overused or over-scored. Johnson directs expertly with a clear love for the genre being sent up.It is a cleverly scripted film too, shining especially in the smart and affectionate 70s murder mystery throwbacks and deliciously salty one liners and insults from Ransom. The story never felt dull to me and even when things seemed obvious too early some ingenious unexpected twists are brought in. Can totally see how Johnson was so influenced by Christie's writing, evidenced from as early on as the terrific opening sequence and with Christopher Plummer's patriarch character (a type of character seen frequently in Christie's books). A fine example of how to bring freshness to a very familiar genre often visited, while the final solution is incredibly clever though demands full attention.Moreover, the ensemble cast, one of the best from that year, clearly have a ball. There is some delicious deadpan but also some inspired but not overdone scenery-chewing. Accent aside, Craig does a great job breaking away from his Bond image and revels being comedic in a laconic way. Plummer (RIP) is perfectly cast and while his screen time is not large he makes the absolute most of it. Ana De Armas has one of the most difficult roles and shows no signs of being taxed. Jamie Lee Curtis, Toni Collette, Don Johnson and Michael Shannon all give it everything they've got. My favourite performance came from Evans, also breaking away from typecasting, he was never this witty or salty.Overall, very, very good. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

"Refreshing revisit of the classic ""Whodunnit""","Great movie that really does have all the hallmarks of the classic murder mystery. The story is fairly typical, there is a shocking death, everyone has their motives, and piece by piece the truth is pulled together by a sleuth, in this case Benoit Blanc (great name), who comes across as a more modern version of Hercule Poirot.To discuss the story, is to give away the twists and turns it takes, which are delightful. Tension is maintained really well throughout the film as you constantly try to guess and workout where this mystery is going, and even right at the end the twist that comes doesn't do anything to release that tension until literally the last 1min of the movie.The real joy though is in an all star A-list cast all performing at the top of their game, and working so well together. In many cases playing against type which is a joy to watch. If you're a fan of murder mystery, then this is a much watch!",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

fun time at the movies,"I enjoyed this a lot. Clever, interesting and plausible in its logic. I enjoyed the deception put forth by the characters. I can usually tell where something is going and was genuinely surprised by the hole in the hole of the donut.Some people might hate the politics of it, but I thought it gave a good dig at both sides while still being fairly liberal. FOX watchers will hate it, which I can see as kind of fueling the negative reviews.What can also fuel the negative reviews. is all the positive hype about it. Too much enthusiasm from the critics can hurt a movie sometimes. Viewers go into the theater expecting too much.Things never live up to the hype and this one didn't live up to it for me.

Just saw it and do not understand the hype,"I'm a mystery lover and have seen and read every Agatha Christie tale. I found this movie very slow for the first half. Second half picked up but again there was no deep mystery of whodunit, nor the charm and period atmosphere of a Poirot episode (which I can watch over and over - thank you David Suchet and the other main actors). The lead actress was very attractive, but the vomiting was definitely disgusting to watch, as well as ridiculously unbelievable (I guess that was the funny part?). Some of the characters had been under the sunlamp too many times or smoked way too often and looked weather-beaten. Did not like the sucking on cigars constantly. The last part was more entertaining and finally there was the rapid-fire conclusion thank the Lord. Agree that Daniel Craig with that southern accent was just super annoying. Great grandmother bored me after first moments of her being silent in an odd hat. Over and over. It moved pretty slowly for me at times. I guess I'm in a minority on this one.

Nice take on murder mystery!,"Generally speaking you tend to find more murder mystery TV shows than movies, this is partially since it's hard to build a complete mystery in the allotted movie running time.
This movie builds this murder beautifully by showing the different points of views of the suspects. It has a different take than other movies since it gives the viewer a little too much details mid-movie which leaves you questioning everything to the last minute.
The acting was brilliant and I didn't feel the number of characters was overdoing it at any stage.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
"""My House My Rules My Coffee""","""Knives Out,"" directed by Rian Johnson, is a refreshing take on the classic murder mystery genre that masterfully combines wit, style, and social commentary. From the moment the film begins, viewers are drawn into the intricately woven tale of the Thrombey family, who gather to celebrate the life of their wealthy patriarch, Harlan Thrombey. However, the festivities take a dark turn when Harlan is found dead, and a sophisticated detective, Benoit Blanc, played with charm and charisma by Daniel Craig, is called to unravel the truth.The film thrives on its ensemble cast, which features an impressive lineup, including Ana de Armas, Chris Evans, Jamie Lee Curtis, and Toni Collette, each delivering standout performances that breathe life into the eccentric members of the Thrombey family. Johnson skillfully develops each character, exposing their flaws and secrets, which fuels the intrigue and keeps viewers guessing as to who might be responsible for Harlan's demise.Visually, ""Knives Out"" is a feast for the eyes. The film's lavish set design and vibrant color palette create a rich, immersive world that feels both modern and nostalgic. The screenplay is smart and sharp, filled with clever dialogue and unexpected twists that challenge audiences' assumptions and keep them engaged from start to finish.What sets ""Knives Out"" apart is its ability to weave social commentary into the narrative. As we uncover the cracks in the Thrombey family's fa√ßade, the film subtly critiques issues of wealth, privilege, and entitlement, all while maintaining its light-hearted tone and sharp humor.""Knives Out"" is a brilliantly crafted mystery that successfully blends clever storytelling with an engaging ensemble cast. Rian Johnson's direction ensures that the film is not only entertaining but also thought-provoking, making it a standout addition to the genre. Whether you're a fan of classic whodunits or simply enjoy a well-told story, ""Knives Out"" is a captivating experience that should not be missed.8.5/10üî•",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

A fun little mystery with a slick pay off,"Knives Out (2019)
8/10üó°üö™üíâüí∏""Rian Johnson successfully revives the ""whodunnit"" mystery subgenre with this perfectly cast fun time, even if it doesn't bring anything groundbreaking to the table.""Knives Out is the kind of ""whodunnit"" film that will never fail to entertain. As a progressive mystery, Knives Out is a very fashionable movie with it's grand ensemble of fresh and familiar faces. With some very snarky and slick writing, these characters are albeit memorable, most notably Daniel Craig's Detective Blanc and Chris Evan's Ransome, however, the film fails to make full use of the ensemble to the greatest extent. Of course that never takes away from what else Knives Out has to offer. The intensity of every moment that leaves you questioning the motive and action behind the titled crime scene is delivered with such glorious fashion, one could say Murder on the Orient Express had a beautiful baby, this being the result, showing Rian Johnson's strongholds. While the first two acts of the movie are quite strong and promising, the third act finds itself being a little rough around the edges but manages to find it's footing upon the conclusion; one for all and all for one.Verdict: Knives Out not only proves to us that Rian Johnson is a strong director with the right material, but also displays a fashionable reiteration of what the mystery genre can do to keep us guessing what is left in store for us to see in all the right ways.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

Nice,"Good story with a creative and effective delivery. Very well written screenplay with all loose ends tied up together and reasonable foreshadowing and morals that echoes throughout, but there weren't any striking moments even to the point of final reveal, possibly due to the addition of yet more details approaching the end in an attempt to create a (slightly) forced satisfying end. Unnecessary characters and scenes that serve little to no purpose in the story other than for comedic effect were present, which maybe one of the reasons why audience may have a sense of emptyness when leaving the theatre. Nonetheless, Knives Out remains a fresh form of storytelling that is trying to achieve and convey more than your ordinary murder mystery.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Rather Dull,"Enjoyable in patches, it just doesn't engage. Hollywood has a long history of silly accents, and the accent adopted by Daniel Craig is just plain daft and simply not needed. Why oh why do actors agree to do such things. The biggest irony for me is there is a clip of an episode of 'murder she wrote' and every episode of that Angela Lansbury series was better written and acted than this film. The director can't make his mind up whether this is comedy, pastiche or a real murder mystery. Some of the acting is appalling and none of it that good. The script is badly written and the continuity dodgy in places. There have been other films that have tried such plots with dysfunctional families and none seem to work but such stories seem to on the small screen.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Massively underwhelming,"Being a middle aged Englishman I've been brought up on a diet of murder mystery stories and in many respects I've been spoilt. When the stories have translated from book to screen the production value is almost always secondary to the good conjunct story. I was very excited, having read the reviews, that seemingly in the case of 'Knives Out' I would be getting a rare trinity of a good story, good actors and good production. It certainly has two of the three. Unfortunately this film thinks it's cleverer than it is. It's simply a story of a privileged family and their pettiness with a rather trivial murder mystery chucked in as a contrivance to get them all together. Rian Johnson attempts to display the worst nature of the privileged minority with all the subtlety of a man screaming 'I am woke' at the top of his lungs at anybody who'll listen. Unfortunately subtlety and nuance are what makes for a good mystery story, you need to pay attention so as not to miss anything. With this film you could miss probably the middle third of the film and you'd not be any less aware of what's happening. A bit of a shame really.",4.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

Inexplicable hype for a mediocre film,"Knives out uses a really old idea, the ""whodunit"". Unfortunately, contrary to what many claim, there is not much here that makes it particular different or modern, except some hipster dialogue and humor (including a lot of throwing up by a specific character) and some commentary on current social issues, like the immigrant crisis, and pointing fingers at the ultra-rich, which is ironic because the writer/director of this movie is by now a multimillionaire and one of the highest paid directors in Hollywood. The writing is full of supposedly smart dialogue and ideas. In reality there not much cleverness here, while it constantly feels like the movie is trying too hard, and comes across as very pretentious and smugish. Most of the humor falls completely flat, it is overlong (130 minutes), twists are not surprising and don't really make sense. Only bright spots, Daniel Craig's amusing performance and the very talented Ana de Armas. Other than that, a semi-entertaining, mediocre and ultimate forgettable film. A perfect example of an uninspired writer/director, with a complete lack of originality, who uses a boring overused premise and accomplishes nothing new or interesting in the least.Personally I don't know much about Star Wars as I don't really follow pop-corn franchises, so I don't know what's going on with this director and Star Wars. However, it is very puzzling seeing this mediocre film which basically takes place in a house, getting so much marketing hype and buzz, while Hollywood seems to be in love with this movie and its' director.

Pure Entertainment,"2019 has blessed movie fans with an impressively strong finish to the year in film. Among the excellent movies released in the past few months, ""Knives Out"" is perhaps the most purely entertaining. The star-studded cast pairing with a virtuoso director of consistently compelling movies served as powerful ingredients in the recipe for an entertaining movie, and the dish was prepared to perfection.Despite what a few angry Star Wars fanboys will tell you about Rian Johnson and his sacrilegious creation, ""The Last Jedi"" Johnson is one of the better writer/directors in Hollywood. In my humble opinion, Johnson's Star Wars movie is perhaps the best in the saga.Nevertheless, Johnson's latest romp should please all audiences. This film boasts one of the most impressive casts in recent memory, each member of which plays against type in a delightfully over-the-top fashion. Leading the pack is Daniel Craig (James Bond himself) playing a brilliant investigator named Benoit Blanc and flashing the same accent he would if he became the new KFC Colonel in the latest commercial. Yes, his southern drawl is comically exaggerated, but that is completely intentional. Many the best lines in the movie come with an implied wink at the camera, letting us know that everyone is in on the joke. Even Chris Evans (the beloved Captain America and the perhaps more beloved Twitter voice of good) plays a loathsome spoiled child of an entitled upbringing, who ruthlessly insults his family and hates dogs. I'll let you decide which of those traits is worse.As a whodunnit, the movie is effective in ways you might not see coming and in plenty of ways you will. Even though the events leading to the death are revealed 40 minutes into the movie, Johnson manages to subvert expectations and remain steps ahead of viewers until the very end. I dare you to guess every twist and solve the puzzle before Blanc. The character often looks to be underwhelming as a detective, but that is also intentional. He eventually reveals himself to be multiple steps ahead the entire time.Raw humor, suspense, and caustic social commentary combine to elicit one of the best screenplays of the year, one that deserves serious Oscar consideration. When the dust settles and mystery has been solved, the end result is a charming and satisfying mystery/comedy. We all deserve more movies like this, and we can thank Johnson for giving us one.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

Disappointing but still enjoyable,"After having seen all of Johnson's movies except for The Brothers Bloom I expected something a little bit more from Knives Out. A more mature, cold film with it's tounge in cheek is what I wanted after previously enjoying Brick and Looper so much. I was at least very happy to see it put a curious twist on the murder mystery genre. The story takes a very different path than I expected. Sadly, it seems as though they could have gone in harder with this twist, it goes back to the usual motions after a while.As it is this has to be Johnson's most accessible movie yet. It's a star-studded cast filled with old reliabales and also some newcomers. Though I don't feel as though the actors were given very much time to properly shine it's all very lovely and nice. The high saturation and crazy colorful sets should grab the interest of most viewers aswell, though I do find the cinematography quite formulaic.If you're looking for a nice family film you can take your children or parents to you're sure to have a blast.

Old-fashioned murder-mystery thriller executed with wit,"Knives Out is a murder-mystery movie in the key of old-fashioned Agatha Christie or Edgar Wallace novels and their cinematic adaptations throughout the sixties and seventies of the last century. This sounds worse than it is because a movie without an overdose of special effects that goes back to the basics is actually quite refreshing. Elderly audiences will adore this movie and it might as well introduce younger audiences to this almost forgotten type of cinema.This thriller works well for numerous reasons. The actors and actresses are veterans and talented youngster who complement one another perfectly. Young Cuban actress Ana de Armas delivers the goods as good-hearted caretaker who ends up mingled in a crime. Veteran Christopher Plummer is excellent as eccentric author who despises his own family. The diversified Daniel Craig convinces as mysterious investigator who tries to put all the pieces of the puzzle together.The locations and settings are simple but very efficient in this movie. Most parts of the film take place in a gorgeous mansion and even though the architecture and landscapes look splendid, the tight rooms and sinister decorations give the film a gloomy vibe. The few scenes that are filmed away from that location offer some refreshing diversity in form of small appartments, charming downtown areas and rural restaurants.The plot obviously comes around with a few twists and turns. However, those don't come as big surprises if you are familiar with this type of storytelling. Another minor issue is that too many details are revealed rather quickly through flashbacks. This movie would have been even better if it had given its audience the time and occasion to come to its own conclusions and put the pieces of the puzzle together.Still, Knives Out offers one hundred thirty minutes of old-fashioned but well-executed murder-mystery entertainment and convinces thanks to a solid plot, great locations and gifted actresses and actors. In addition to this, this film also offers some soial criticism by pointing out the egoism, greed and manipulation of the rich and the famous. If you want to know what kind of movies your parents or grand-parents enjoyed when they were younger, give this film a fair chance. Sometimes, going back to basics means advancing in the right direction.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Would have been an order of magnitue better without Johnston's warbled symbolism,"The idea of it mattering more what you do with the truth than the pursuit of it is a clever one, but instead of shining a light on prejudice, bias, and arrogance, it actually encourages all of these things in the audience by confirming all of those things in the end instead of destroying them.We're led to hate everyone who deserves hating right off the bat, and that never changes. What's worse, the people we're led to find innocuous only become more so as the story progresses. In short nobody grows and it ends up being a somewhat terrible mystery. It gets points for twists and turns, but none of those happen because of changes in the characters behavior or outlook. Johnston put all of the characters in their place from the get-go and never let them even wiggle slightly.The acting saves this movie. It is definitely worth watching just for the magnificent performances by everyone involved. It is just sad that they had to 'pay the pound' for Johnston's gross soapboxing, while the penny was the movie and mystery itself.It's interesting that there was an attempt to make fun of both SJWs and Nazis in this, while it so blatantly implied that rich entitled Americans are everything bad and illegal immigrants are everything good and hard-working. Such an unnecessary subtext in a murder mystery. especially considering it doesn't change throughout the movie...it's actually the one thing that's consistent.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
The problem with the film is its unfulfilled potential.,"Others have mentioned the old house might have held some secrets (it didn't). Or that it might present a more structured ""Whodunit"" that leaves you guessing (it didn't). Or that the main character might offer a bit of verve, cleverness or pizazz, that might have livened up the whole affair (she doesn't, at all).I also take some issue with the director's choices in scene framing, especially in the beginning. There should have been more close-ups, and better initial intros for each character's little idiosyncrasies so we would could warm up to them. I simply don't care for how it was shot; it's terribly pedestrian. The fast, quick edits of the trailer are totally absent! There's something missing here. Todd Solondz, Tim Burton or the Cohen Brothers really could have drawn these characters out more and given the actors something real to work with.I thought it would sparkle with a bit more witty, dark humor. It wasn't quite as funny or snappy as I was expecting it to be. Instead, it settles on delivering more of a ""message"" about this girl, who does good, while the others do bad.There's also no need for Daniel Craig's poor Southern accent. He should have just done a British accent, it would have been fine and enjoyable, maybe given the film a bit more weight it seems it was shooting for, in the end, with its messaging.Additional viewings might reveal there's more to it, but I suspect such might reveal there's less.",5.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
The return of the ensemble whodunit - great fun to watch,"What fun must have been had by all, making this modern actors movie with deliberate fifties and eighties elements. And what fun for us viewers. It's always good news a film takes 2 hours and feels shorter watching it.
Ana de Armas - now meeting Daniel Craig as add-kicking bond girl, has a lot on her shoulders, playing the vulnerable nurse around whom hateful family member circle as ever so many vultures and lights up the scenes. More action heroes on holiday here: Chris Evans shows he is a character actor, effectively playing the nasty guy. I enjoyed Toni Collette as the hysteric one and Jamie Lee Curtis as Mrs. cool and collected. And what about Don Johnson as a clueless dad...
I've read about all Christie's work and so many elements are elegantly used. The mansion, the racketeers, the twisted family histories, even BBC 80's style the title role lettering... it's all there to enjoy

A great and surprisingly funny murder mystery like no other,"Probably the best film I have seen this year and one of the most memorable theatrical experiences I have ever had seeing it at its world premiere at TIFF. Thanks to the success of his previous studio film, The Last Jedi, Johnson gets to create a passion project that is so desperately needs to be seen in theatres.Johnson shows his love for the murder mystery genre but avoids falling into its predictable plot mechanics. The opening of Knives Out sets the table of what you would expect from this kind of premise on paper. The death of the celebrity author Harlan Thrombey (Christopher Plummer) brings in all the family members seeking the opportunity to selfishly claim his inheritance and the strange circumstances of his passing calls in private investigator Benoit Blanc (Daniel Craig) to solve the case. But once most of the character archetypes are established within the first act, Johnson allows his originality as a filmmaker to take over. From they're the perspectives shift and the twists elevate the story in a direction that is refreshing and surprisingly really funny. The humor becomes unrelenting and infectious, as everyone in the theatre could not hold back the laughter, with Johnson playing on genre's tropes and being meta about it.Johnson lets each of the cast members have fun and stand apart from one another with each playing really dynamic and complex character he has written. Chris Evans just relishes in playing the ruthless and yet complex grandson Ransom and doesn't hold back on spitting insults to anyone including his own family members. Michael Shannon plays a role slightly less antagonistic and more pathetic as youngest son Walt who gets no respect from his family. Jamie Lee Curtis continues to be a force of charisma to watch as the eldest daughter Linda. Even smaller but no less significant roles like Noah Segan and Lakieth Stanfield are also worth calling out.While Daniel Craig may get top-billing in the poster, the movie completely rest on Ana De Armas to carry the story and serve as the audience's perspective into this world. As Harlan's nurse Marta, she shows how isolated and alone she feels with the rest of Thrombley family despite they pretend to have her best interest. But as the plot progresses, De Armas gets to show range including some unexpected comedic moments and becomes more of a pivotal role in the mystery.
Daniel Craig gives full commitment to his over-the-top character. Craig as Blanc gets some of the best and most hysterical lines as he spout bizarre and confusing analogies in a super-thick Southern accent. He strikes a good balance of intelligence and hysterical as a man who is very perceptive of people's intention but also being really exaggerated and ridiculous in a good way.Similar to what he did with the Star Wars franchise in the Last Jedi, Johnson brings in social political commentary into a very old and tired genre to make if feel relevant. In this case, he uses the Thrombey family dynamic to tackle issues on the wealth of the 1%, immigration and self-entitled privilege. In the opening interview, Harlan's adult kids and in-laws all say they believe that each of their successful careers come from hard work despite flashbacks reveal they leech off of Harlan's own self-earned wealth and celebrity name. And with Marta coming from an immigrant family and being Harlan's personal nurse, the Thrombey's keep acknowledging subtly and (unsubtly in a heated family argument about politics) her lower status in society to boost their ego even they think it comes from a sense of sympathy. The oblivious nature and lack of wokeness most of the family retains (particularly with Don Johnson's and Toni Collete's characters) shows how much they have been too sheltered in their own rich bubble that creates a lot of great satirical humour.Regardless if you liked or disliked The Last Jedi, are fan of Rian Johnson in general as a filmmaker or just love the murder-mysteries in film, Knives Out is a big crowd pleaser that uses its huge big name cast to full efficiency. Just when you think you have the plot figured out, it adds twists upon twists that don't dragged down the story but elevate. Once it comes out in nation-wide theatres, see it as soon as you can.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Passes The Time,"""Knives Out"" is a perfectly entertaining, perfectly agreeable little film, a star-studded old-style murder-mystery that's good fun while it lasts. The actors involved all seem to be having fun and the plot keeps you engaged, even right up to the reveal when you will, as can often happen with these things, find yourself saying, ""Oh, so that's...hang on, that doesn't make any sense"". For indeed, plot and motivation holes abound and ultimately you're left with a decent film (although some might find the lie/reflux plot point a trifle irritating).

Disappointed,"What a waste of a stellar cast. The trailer shows almost all the scenes that the famous people are in together. The rest of the time you are watching a little known Cuban actress who is apparently the star of the movie.

So much for complexity of characters (which is usually the backbone of a good mystery!) The only family member that seems slightly redeemable is the owner of all this wealth, because, in his old age he's come upon the wisdom that the only way to fix his evil evil family is to cut them all off with out a red cent.My take away: at the end of the movie I turned to my husband and said, ""white man bad"".

Entertaining,"When the millionaire writer Harlan Thrombey (Christopher Plummer) is found dead at home, the police investigate his apparent suicide together with the famous private investigator Benoit Blanc (Daniel Craig), who was mysteriously hired by someone interested in finding if Harlan was killed. They interview the dysfunctional family members and the servants that lived or worked with Harlan in his mansion but when his testament is opened, the investigation presents twists and surprises.""Knives Out"" is an entertaining but overrated film in the style of Agatha Christie. Benoit Blanc is a kind of Sherlock Holmes and the cast is excellent. The screenplay begins without any character development and the viewer learns the characters along the investigation.

Nothing Special,"I say it's nothing special and I'm not a Star Wars fanatic. I've never even seen the film people are so angry about, so my review is based purely on my experience of watching this film, Knives Out.I definitely expected more. If it's meant to be amusing, it pretty much failed on that score. This film would be better suited as a TV movie, if they even make them anymore, or something to pop up on Netflix. I didn't pay to see it and I'd feel I'd wasted my money if I had.Visually it was enjoyable-I mean the location, the house, the production values. the family members were an unattractive bunch, so nothing to look at there. Daniel Craig's ""southern"" accent became grating after awhile, and I was squirming a bit with boredom, waiting for it to be over. And, when it was, my reaction was ""So what? Who cares?"" I can hardly remember any of it and I just watched it in the last couple of hours.Convoluted, unrealistic and tedious, like a lot of Agatha Christie stories.

I would say it's mostly a waste of time. It's plots don't twist. The 'whodunit' factor never really comes into play.

The actors were decent so it wasn't really an acting issue. Overall I felt the movie was celebrating its own cleverness the entire time. Of course when you celebrate your own cleverness it usually means you're not half as clever as you think you are.I understand there were some sociopolitical undertones that meant a lot to some folks. The sociopolitical commentary was less than subtle and pretty much just ended up being virtue signaling.

An exciting who done it!,"'Knives Out' was written and directed by Ryan Johnson, the man behind films like 'Looper' and 'Star Wars: The Last Jedi'. I have my problems with The Last Jedi, but I can't rate a film based on a directors earlier film.Let me start with what I didn't like. This isn't your normal run of the mill who done it. The first act you learn something very vital to the plot and from there you don't feel much tension until the third act. With that in mind, my friends and I were still glued to the screen trying to piece together everything that was going on. It in the end was a bit predictable, but this didn't ruin the experience for me. The other thing I really didn't care for was Johnson's use of politics. Now I'm not a very political person, but he uses this to make some characters look ""evil"". I didn't see it when I first watched the film. I was very surprised he even added it in the script, but after thinking about it, he used it as a tool to make characters look more sinister. It's understandable why, but you can write characters to be hated without being political. I even laughed at one of the jokes that was said during this scene until I realized he was actually making a jab at people who think that way. But again, I'm reviewing the film - not people's political views.Now what I liked. The acting was phenomenal across the board. Everyone was a stand out to me except for actor Jaeden Martell (Lieberher). He was previously known for his role as Bill in 2017s 'IT'. He does the best he can with what he is given but he really isn't in the movie, his character just sits around on his phone like me writing this review. I wish I could commend every performance in the film but we would be here all day. My two stand outs would be Chris Evans and Toni Collette. There was also a fun cameo by Frank Oz which was great. This film also has a great fresh style and direction. The way he opens the film really made me cheese. The way he wrote the film was also great. The little clues he gives you throughout were very clever and it kept me on the edge of my seat, literally. The film was also very funny; I was very surprised on how much comedy was in it.Ryan Johnson's 'Knives Out' was a great film with fantastic acting! The story was engaging with a satisfying ending! It was a great time at the movies and I recommend checking this one out. It's no masterpiece, but this gets me excited for what new and engaging stories Johnson has up his sleeves - just stay away from 'Star Wars'.Final verdict: 7.5 / 10That's my 2 cents!Alex Bioni",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

Rollicking Good Time,"Awards season is the only time of year I feel like theaters are full of movies for adults, when films focus on mature and serious subject matter. But I like to laugh and have fun at a movie too, and man did I do both at ""Knives Out."" Rian Johnson embraces the murder mystery genre wholesale and delivers a twisty-turner thriller that's both wildly entertaining and very funny. A superlative cast, witty screenplay, and brilliantly quirky production design are three of this movie's standout qualities. Daniel Craig, complete with Southern Gothic accent, and Ana de Armas are the leads, but they're surrounded by a cast of supporting actors performing at the top of their game. Indeed, if I have any criticism of the film, it's actually a compliment, and that's that I wish the supporting players -- like Jamie Lee Curtis, Toni Collette, Lakeith Stanfield, and Don Johnson (of all people) -- were in the film more.""Knives Out"" is mostly just a good time, but it's also got some serious barbs to throw out at its presumably mostly liberal audience about a certain kind of liberal progressive hypocrisy that rears its ugly head when issues like immigration and economic equality take center stage.Grade: A",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

"This is such a fun, hilarious, keep you guessing til the end who-dun-it!","Can't say much about the plot without giving away spoilers, but I can say everyone should go right out and see this when it hits theaters.

There were so many laughs and gasps and then outright cheers and clapping when the movie was over. It was THAT good! The whole cast was amazing! I mean, why wouldn't they be, considering what an incredible list of actors there are in this? But really, they all were on top game with their acting. You know you're going to get great performances when you can see that the actors are genuinely having the time of their life playing their characters. They were just chewing it up and the banter between them was so entertaining to watch. Rian Johnson is an amazing writer and director, there is no doubt about it. I did not want to see the movie end because I was just having a blast and then when it did, I immediately wanted to see it again. For hours after seeing it, I just kept playing parts over in my head and thinking ""My God! That was brilliant!"" With the theaters recently over-dominated with superhero movies, it's so refreshing to see a classic who-dun-it movie, and one done so perfectly well.

"Razor sharp, unpredictable and thrilling","If I had a chunk, a piece, the tiniest little fragment of Rian Johnson's mind, I'm still not sure I'd know what to do with it. Forgive me for the number of superlatives in this one.Knives Out is astonishing. An immensely entertaining, thrillingly escapist whodunnit that pulls the rug out from underneath you more times than you can count. Every line has a payoff, every hint has a resolution. It's razor sharp and uproariously funny, with Johnson giving every cast member enough juice to play with but plenty of room to still have their own unique kinds of fun. It's a writers' movie through and through, but the cast still shine.Saying any more and properly diving into what Johnson is really doing here risks spoiling elements the film, and Knives Out is not a story you want spoiled. Johnson reliably plays with formula, he riffs on Vertigo and adds layer upon layer, having a blast as he does so - and it's infectious. Sharp, fast, funny and beautifully satisfying down to its body-tinglingly cathartic final frame. Knives Out is a fiendishly and relentlessly clever film, but Johnson does what he always does - he makes it look easy.My favourite film of the year.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

The cast is probably the best part of the film, Craig and Evans in particular are very good but I also really liked Michael Shannon, Don Johnson, Jamie Lee Curtis, Toni Collette and of course Christopher Plummer although I would say that Jaeden Martell diserved a bigger roll, he was pretty good on 2017's It.

A marvelous movie with a fantastic script about a bizarre family 7/10,"""Knives Out"" is a really good and recommended movie. to me it feels weird that the same director who's in charged of the worst Star Wars movie of all time, is the same director of this massive hit. Rian Johnson clearly did a wonderful job with the directing and writing of the film. I have to admit that at first I didn't expect much out of this film. I kind of lower my expectations but at the end I became some sort of a fan. There are two things in particular that impressed me during the film: those are the characters and the plot itself. The plot is fantastic, both funny and chilling at the same time. no surprise that the genres of the film are crime, drama and comedy. but the plot and the writing are done so well that they connect to each other so good. it feels original and not forced. the viewers are not given the whole story and information about the characters but rather they need to come to conclusions on their own. the more the plot gets complicated, the more the audience needs to observe and learn what's happening. The characters are another thing to be impressed by in this movie. rather it be characters like Benoit Blanc (Daniel Craig) and Ransom Drysdale (Chris Evans) who are a pleasure to watch on screen. or characters like Linda Drysdale (Jamie Lee Curtis) and Jacob Thrombey (Jaeden Martell) who you wish something bad happened to them. there are so many different characters that everybody can relay on and every characters with his own personalities. the movie is well shot and edited: a lot of different angels, camera movements and close ups. overall this is a highly recommended film.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

"One Of The Best Films Of The Year, And Certainly Amongst The Most Entertaining","One of the sharpest, smartest & slickest whodunnit murder mysteries that embraces & subverts its genre in equal measure, Rian Johnson's Knives Out is an intelligently plotted & ingeniously directed crowdpleaser that delivers on all fronts, and is all the more bolstered by outstanding performances from its stellar ensemble.By taking the existing template & turning it on itself, Johnson provides his own spin on whodunnit tales and weaves the plot so cleverly that it's always one step ahead of the audience. The story is gripping from the get go, the set up is quick, character introductions are swift, and the juxtaposition of lies & truth offers us a better insight into each character's persona.Johnson's suave direction & sly script further benefits from razor-sharp editing that expertly juggles & interweaves multiple viewpoints into one tightly-knitted structure which is then paced to perfection & never for once loses its momentum. The entire ensemble renders their rich, flavourful characters with finesse. Daniel Craig & Ana de Armas impress the most, with latter's role being the heart & soul of this story.On an overall scale, Knives Out presents writer-director Rian Johnson at the top of his game, and is his finest film to date. An endlessly enjoyable & wildly entertaining cinematic ride that's accomplished in nearly all aspects and features a brilliant cast that nails the brief with effortless ease, Johnson's modern take on the whodunnit is one of the best films of 2019, and certainly amongst the most entertaining.

"Knives out shows that With the right people, Hollywood is still capable of creating their own fantastic stories and fabulous characters !","Movies like this help me restore hope in the modern cinematography. Rian Johnson found a really nice niche. There are not many movies of this type. Sure we had Murder on Orient Express not so long ago and as entertaining as it was it did not really offer anything new to me anyways. The staleness of the story we all read and saw so many times did not really keep me at the edge of my seat.
The same can not be said about Knives Out which is a very good take on murder mystery movies. It is full of interesting characters who are played by strong and well established Hollywood veterans. We have Christopher Plummer. Don Johnson. Jemmi Lee Curtis, Michael Shannon, Toni Colette and of course Daniel Craig, ohhhh Daniel Craig who created an extraordinary character who I hope to see more of and with the huge sucess of Knives Out this might be quite possible. Other played their roles great too, Anna de Armas, Lakeith Stanefield and many others complemented the rest of the cast really well.
The setting of the movie transports you in time, it was a very clever choice of a place for an action to take place in. Creaky stairs, period Victorian house was a clever nod to the era in which brilliant Agatha Christie's books were written in. The movie takes inspirations from her novels and does a pretty good job at it. The house also acts as a great contrast between the worlds of poor and rich.
The dysfunctional rich family and aspiring middle class migrant worker are caught in the intrigue surrounding mysterious and sudden suicide of head of the family. Minute after minute you will get sucked in into this well realized world of mystery.
I really recommend this movie to everyone. This is a breath of fresh air and a wonderful break from all the superhero movies and also a proof that you do not need wonderful books or comics to create a wonderful movie. With the right people Hollywood is still capable of creating their own fantastic stories and fabulous characters. Thank you R Johnson.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

"Enjoyable and satisfying mystery which has comedy, commentary, and a bit of ham, but not to the point of detracting from the core strengths","I'm not a regular at the cinema any more - at one point I'd go weekly, whereas now it is probably once a year at most; last year it was 'Knives Out' that got me there, and I was glad to have watched it in that setting because at home distracted by tasks, requests, and children, probably the film would not have worked quite as well as it did. In the cinema though, with nothing to be a barrier to the film, it was easy to get into its tone and very much go with it. The reward is an enjoyable and satisfying mystery. I do like these type of films, but too often I find myself either many steps behind the detectives, or just having to accept their sudden reveals because I can't keep up enough to understand where all the twists came from. With this film though the mystery is welcoming and engaging, bringing you inside it from the start, and having twists that surprise and reveal, but yet make sense within the context of the film.Within this there is plenty to like. There is a playfulness to the delivery that is regularly funny and enjoyable. It also gives space for a nice slice of ham here and there from the cast. The social commentary is there too, in the way it handles immigrants, or the way the rich try to convince the poor that the former only have the latter's interests in mind. All of these things add to the film, but importantly they do not detract in any way - ie it is never silly, clumsy, or 'woke' but rather the mystery remains the focus throughout. The very talented cast make the most of the material, and the whole production looks great and has very stylish framing and direction. The result is a very entertaining murder mystery that delivers within that genre, while also having plenty more to recommend it for.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
A great rejuvenation of the murder mystery genre,"Rian Johnson is a fantastic director. Even though many criticise him for ruining Star Wars with The Last Jedi, he has proven his skill in previous films like Looper. His new film Knives Out may be his best.Knives Out follows Benoit Blanc, a detective hired to solve the mysterious death of Harlan Thrombey, the patriarch of the eccentric and conflicting Thrombey family.I'm a big fan of the murder mystery genre so I was obviously very excited to this and the ensemble cast increased my anticipation. Rian Johnson has very cleverly and skilfully put together a fantastic homage to the ""whodunnit"" genre. The film has a very old fashioned feeling to it, despite its modern aspects, that is reminiscent of murder mysteries from the 1900s and the Clue board game. The set design, cinematography and costumes built up this incredible atmosphere to the time it's set in.One of the best parts of this movie is the cast. Everyone did a fantastic job as their characters and played off one another exceptionally well. Daniel Craig, with his Southern accent, was really funny at times and his acting was really good especially during the third act. For me, personally, I thought the standout was Ana de Armas. She plays a crucial role in this story and this is the best I've seen her act.Rian Johnson's direction is fantastic throughout as he incorporates a range of style to each shot but it's not just style over substance as his script is witty, hilarious and keeps you invested through the film's entirety. His take of this genre is vastly different from whodunnits in the past which made the experience better in my opinion as I constantly doubted myself on what direction the film was taking.A character I felt was really underutilized was that of Jaeden Martell since he does not contribute much to the film compared to the rest of the cast. Apart from that I don't have any other complaints regarding this film.Knives Out is a really fun time at the theatre. Just the premise of a whodunnit is interesting enough to watch but Rian Johnson's amazing direction, script and ensemble cast make this film shine and unique from previous whodunnits in the past. This is definitely my favourite film of his and cannot wait to see what other ideas he comes up with. Knives Out is one of the best films of the year.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
I had no expectations going in...pleasantly surprised coming out,"One of the more entertaining movies of the year. A well made quirky whodunit.
Liked a lot -
Characters were eclectic, although not too original, but were very entertaining. Daniel Craig's character, as a hired PI, was my favorite. His Southern accent caught me off guard at first. I'm guessing him and Chris Evens took these roles to get past their James Bond and Captain America characters. A nice departure for both.
Very strong acting all the way around, however the lead female actor, Ana de Armas stole the show. She had some great emotional close ups that were very captivating. This is the first movie I noticed her in but I will look for her now in others.
The pace of the file was strong from beginning to end. One of the few films over the last year that I lost track of time and was fully immersed in.
Good for all ages, which was nice since I had a 12 year old with me. All of the family enjoyed the film.So so -
The whodunit kept me engaged until the end, but the plot did have some holes. I was OK with them since they didn't play a big role in the overall story line. Also, the move was moving fast, so I soon forgot about them.Dislike -
One of the main reasons I couldn't give this 10 stars (besides the plot holes) is that the movie had the charters talk about present day politics at the dinner table. I'm very liberal and the message that was being supported was liberal as well, but I go to (comedy) movies to get away from politics. It wasn't needed and was a turn off for me. I thought the movie did the same thing, but in a much better and subtle way, when all of the family claimed that the Latino nurse (the main caregiver of the murdered father, played by Ana de Armas) was part of their family, but couldn't remember where the nurse's family was from (a running joke through out the film as the characters told what happened from their point of view). Or how the family didn't want the nurse to be at the funeral, but everyone claimed to the nurse's face that they voted that she should be allowed to attend (another running joke). I thought these more subtle ways did a great job showing how the family felt about ""the help"", making the more direct approach at the dinner table feel preachy (didn't fit the mood of the quirky comedy). The same is true about one of the characters (the grandson of the murdered grandfather). I won't go into details, but you will get my point when you see the movie. That ways over the top and not needed either.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
A Brilliant Who-donut,"The magnetic Daniel Craig as Benoit Blanc is by far one of the greatest filmic creations of 2019. This film, and specifically Blanc, brilliantly walks the line between campiness and seriousness; and, in doing so, is one of the most enjoyable theater-going experiences of the year. Just one of Blanc's ridiculous, Southern, overlong monologues about the pursuit of truth will have you laughing in a confused awe.This film's screenplay is smart, as it reveals crucial information early and still surprises and excites throughout. Similarly, this film tricks you into thinking you know the right information, just to show you how you've been missing it all along. Every detail matters, as crucial information is quietly planted in the first few scenes to end in loud, surprising payoffs.

"Family bad, immigrants good","I was recommended this movie as a classic whodunit with clever twists and colorful characters. But the twists weren't all too clever and the whodunit isn't so classic.
It is a stylish movie, but the story is actually rather lame and unexciting when you take away the A-list actors and the glossy finish. Besides, a few key scenes don't really make sense, but have to be that way because the plot wouldn't work otherwise (meeting dangerous people in dark alleys instead of crowded places type of stuff).
It was also impossible to miss the racial undertones. The makers of the film were obviously drawing a metaphor for the demographic shift in America, clearly expressing their satisfaction with a certain majority being on the way out. (Once you see the final scene you'll know what I mean.)Bottom line: You can watch it and you won't get bored, but don't expect too much.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

What a ridiculous flick,"The last few years have had some stinker wannabe ""mystery"" films, especially the recent rehashes of the Hercule Poirot detective tales Murder On the Orient Express and Death On the Nile. The forer was ok, but the latter sucked so hard it was pathetic.And then theres Knives Out...oof. This was one of the most convoluted movies i have seen in the last decade. It was almost as if the writer had watched too many films by Wes Anderson while on hard drugs and thought he could up the nuanced plot and tone down the comedy. Well great job, you succeeded in making a watered down Wes Anderson story that was barely a passable modern take on Clue. Which was alluded to if not mentioend early in the movie in passing reference.Watch with a stiff drink or not at all. Because its even worse when a British actor tries to do an American accent, and boy...did they choose terribly with the pained old face of Daniel Craig sounding like a cross between Fog Horn LEghorn and Colonel Sanders. Not as bad as hearing TOm Hardy whisper his bad American accent in the Venom films, but close. If not for the huge cast of well known actors, this would get a lower rating. BUt as it stands, it warrants only a 5 out of 10.",5.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
predictable / why is this movie so highly praised,Knives out while has an amazing cast is predictable and a real letdown. I love murder mysteries but by the time you get to the twist ending you are left rolling your eyes,,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
A very fun whodunit,"I had a fun time unravelling the mystery of Knives out, it takes so many twists and turns and executes the whole whodunit formula really well. The cast is fantastic every character in the film have very distinct personality traits that stick out and they are all played really well, Ana De Armas does a great job of being a protagonist that balances out all the exotic personalities these characters have. If one person stuck out the most in the film it was definitely Daniel Craig, the accent he puts on is fantastic while not exactly an accurate southern accent it is used in a way where its supposed to be exaggerated adding to the fun nature of the film. The writing is pretty great with the twists and turns blindsiding you at times making it more and more intriguing as the mystery slowly unravels.While I say the writing for the most part is great it has certain moments and sequences in the film that go for too long which can sometimes make you slightly bored and draw your attention away from the movie, it is quick however to getting you back to being engrossed in the mystery, if these sequences were slightly shorter and more concise it would benefit the film to me.While not perfect Knives out is a movie I had fun with and would be a whodunit I would recommend you watch especially if you're a fan of the genre or of the films fantastic cast members, 2019 is an excellent year for film and this just adds to that list.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Knives Out Review,"If I were to briefly describe Knives Out, then it would be constantly engaging and entertaining. If you were not a big fan of The Last Jedi then I urge you to check this film out and see that Rian Johnson is a more capable director when he is working on his own. It's a film with issues that are minor and were the only issues I had with the film. The film does have some political subtext to it which I liked but there were some areas where it was a little on the nose. It didn't take me out of the movie but I wished it had been handled a little better. This movie has a bunch of A-list actors and they all bring their A-game. Every performance in this movie is pretty great but Daniel Craig, Chirs Evans, and Ana de Armas steal every scene they are in. It can be a little hard to get used to Craig's heavy southern drawl at first but you eventually get used to it. Chris Evans is a nice counterweight to everyone's craziness. I felt he was one of the funniest characters in the movie except for one joke. Ana de Armas is a great protagonist to follow throughout the film along with Daniel Craig. All 3 of them disappear into their roles and portray their characters almost perfectly. It's a great redemption film for Chris Evans from Red Sea Diving Resort. The script is pretty great. There are tons of clues hidden beneath each line of dialogue and it all feels very natural. This allows for Johnson's comedic writing to shine. He is able to cleverly insert jokes that most of the time are pretty hilarious. The reason the comedy didn't work that well in The Last Jedi for me was that it felt forced and didn't always align well with the tone but the comedy shines here because it fits the film's tone perfectly. While not every joke is hilarious, a majority of them are. The jokes that go along with certain characters fit their character pretty well. Some of the funniest lines in the movie are delivered by Michael Shannon and Daniel Craig because the jokes they tell perfectly fit their characters. The story is fairly simple but Rian Johnson throws a lot of simple twists throughout that makes it feels unique. The film decides to reveal what actually happened to the victim halfway through the film and it turns into a cover up which then progresses to a pretty major twist that I never saw coming but felt necessary and made sense to the narrative. The music was also pretty good. It added tension and was interesting to listen to while the events unfolded. Overall, Knives Out is a great murder mystery with great performances, a great script, hilarious jokes, and some interesting twists.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

Knives Out,"Knives Out is a star studded whodunit where all the suspects are gathered in the mansion.It is a knowing variation of the board game Cluedo which itself was turned into a movie in the mid 1980s. The victim is best selling crime novelist Harlan Thrombey (Christopher Plummer.)A private detective Benoit Blanc (Daniel Craig) has been hired to find out if the writer's death really was murder or as the police suspect, a suicide. A recently changed will might lead to a motive.This comedy mystery is reliant on Harlan's personal nurse Marta (Ana de Armas) a woman who physically throws up if she tells a lie.Following the conventions of many Agatha Christie mysteries and the Columbo movies. Knives Out turns a lot of the essential ingredients of the genre in his head by adding several layers to the story.However it is not original as there have been several movies that have twisted the crime mystery genre.

Well.. it's hard to go against public opinion but I gotta be honest.,"Knives Out is an okay movie. There are so many haters of this film rating it 1-stars just because they don't like Rian Johnson and what he did to the Star Wars: Last Jedi apparently and a lot of others who rate it 10-stars to revoke the 1-star ratings. But the movie is basically ok. And I'm sad to acknowledge it as I really, really wanted to like it. I mean c'mon look at the cast!Knives Out is ok for basic entertainment when you don't have anything else to do and just want to have fun at the movies but it has soooo many plot holes and insults to the viewer that I can't just close my eyes on them.You know there's this saying that if you start explaining the joke then it's not funny. It's about this movie exactly! They do so much explaining that your brain hurts. It's basically an insult because I kinda sat there and felt that there shouldn't have been so much explaining. I mean sometimes you gotta trust the audience. That they'll get it. This is either inconfidence in yourself or in the audience. There's at least like 15 minutes of the movie explaining itself and what's going on but they could've done it in a more subtle way with hints, looks and feels. Not with words. The movie has so many shifts and turns that you kinda look at it funnily. And not only the plot turns but also the movie and genre itself. It's almost like it's not as self-aware.This might be one of the very few times that I'll say I didn't like the acting in an American film. They all are great actors and Americans are somehow natural at this but this film didn't even require a whole lot of range from them. It relies on its script of a ""whodunit"" and beautiful cinematography and scenery to carry out the film. Actors were acting like in a play or smth. Do you remember those theatrical experience where acting is over-the-top? When it's just too much? There's a scene at the end where a man is trying to bribe a policeman by waving money in the air, in front of them, when everybody's looking. That's zero subtlety. You feel like you're getting spoon-fed smth that could've been done in a more serious fashion.When you turn 180 degrees, you're basically back at the same spot Rian. Quit turning.

"Wickedly smart, with characters and performances to match","There are so many things I love about 'Knives Out', but possibly the one I love most is that it proves if your story is strong enough then you don't need gratuitous action sequences to pad the run time and keep the audience entertained. 'Knives Out' has one brief car chase that doesn't have a lot put into it (even the characters reference what a terrible car chase it is) and that's it. The rest of the movie is just the story unfolding. And yet it is so gripping that it is one of the best paced films of 2019.The cast in this movie is incredible. It is all-star and everyone in it plays their parts perfectly. I have to give special mention to Daniel Craig though. I haven't often liked Craig's performances outside of the 'Bond' series, but here he is truly fantastic. The accent he chose to go with took a little adjusting to, but by the end of the movie I couldn't imagine his character without it. He was a pleasure to watch on screen.This is one of the smartest movies I've ever seen. Every detail is laid out masterfully. It's a movie you could watch 100 times and you'd still be picking up on new things.

A Fine B Movie,"Mystery writer Christopher Plummer has died. Although the police have just about wrapped up their investigation, his nurse, Ana de Armas is nervous; she knows that she had given him the wrong doses of medicine, the antidote was missing from her bag, and he had slashed his throat after arranging with her an elaborate charade so she would would not be suspected. The family and police are satisfied, yet here is the great detective Daniel Craig, holding it open. He has been hired to investigate, although he does not know by whom. The plot thickens when the will is read, and the heir to Plummer's vast fortune is Miss de Armas.Once upon a time, the movie theaters ran full programs of selected short subjects, a feature film, and quite often a second feature. The second features were generally lower-budgeted movies, meant to be rented out to the theaters at a flat rate, and often genre films.... like mystery films. Some of these second features were series, and quite popular; it was not unknown for people to go to a show specifically for the second feature, a Sherlock Holmes mystery, or a Charlie Chan mystery, featuring stars who perhaps did not shine brightly enough for the major studios' A pictures, but would bring in the customers.Eventually, the program shortened: no more selected short subjects, no more second feature. Nowadays, a movie show usually consists of a feature film and previews of coming attractions. Yet, long as it is, and with such a varied and interesting cast as it has -- Chris Evans, Jamie Lee Curtis, Michael Shannon, Don Johnson, and half a dozen others -- this movie strikes me as a B picture, with an ornate plot, some small and gratifying witticisms.... in short, a superior example of the form.If you are wise enough to see this movie, you will be sorely confused, as mystery is piled atop mystery, and how to untangle them all. I know I was. At the end, all will be revealed, and the journey from start to finish will have turned out to be worthwhile.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

Postmodern Poirot,"I didn't like Rian Johnson's The Last Jedi but this is a clever little comedy/murder mystery with some interesting twists; Rian's brand of irreverent, postmodern humor works better here than in Star Wars, where winking at the audience while mocking characters and lore was noxious to the whole thing. The cast is great and efficiently delivers the required ping-pong of quips and zingers.See also the much darker (and superior) thriller/black comedy Sleuth with Laurence Olivier and Michael Caine, which probably served as one of the inspirations for this, starting with the setting, the secluded mansion of an eccentric mystery writer.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
An Absolute Blast,"When news broke that Ren√©e Zellweger was cast as Bridget Jones, I remember mutterings and complaints from British critics and audiences; couldn't an up and coming British actor have been given such the opportunity? What sort of mess would the American make of the accent? Hugh Grant and Colin Firth were cast opposite her and despite the complaints and suspicions, the film was a huge hit, spawned sequels and it now seems rather quaint to think about these complaints at all.This was in the back of mind approaching Knives Out. Director Rian Johnson directs a starry American cast (and Daniel Craig, sporting an occasionally inconsistent Southern accent) in a film he also wrote that was to be a homage to the British murder mystery in general and Agatha Christie in particular. I could imagine some of the genre most loyal fans getting uptight about an American take on British traditions, but I hadn' t heard many of these complaints - may be, Brexit and Trump notwithstanding - we're all a bit more internationally-minded now.In any case, it really doesn't matter. Knives Out is a blast. The plot is a finely constructed work of crystalline beauty; each performance from the stellar cast is given at least a few moments in the sun; the denouement has more than one 'aha!' moment as revelations fall into place; and there are more laugh out loud moments than in many comedies, all of which occur without taking the viewer out of the moment, undercutting the drama. To cap it all, the film also works - and is clearly intended to, especially in light of the ending - as a metaphor for how immigration and precisely the sort of nationalism which turned its nose up at the thought of an American Bridget Jones; but it's not a metaphor that dominates the film, nor is it an overtly political one.What it is, is a very, very entertaining film which has - if those who need to say yes to such things do so - the clear capacity to produce a sequel or three. It's one of those films likely to be enjoyed by people who don't go to the cinema, to be discussed over Christmas dinner (rather than the politics), to be curled up with in a couple of years in the week between Christmas and New Year.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Fun and well-executed mystery,"'Knives Out' is a mostly-light-hearted timeless ensemble ""whodunnit?"" Essentially, Blanc (Craig), Elliott (Stanfield) and Wagner (Segan) are investigating the death of the patriarch of the Thrombey family, Harlan (Plummer). Thankfully, there's plenty of flashbacks in the first hour, so Plummer does get some screen time. We then meet the extended family and start to unravel various potential motives and inconsistencies in their stories.The cast is huge and all solid - Marta (de Armas) as Harlan's nurse, Linda (Lee Curtis) and Walt (Shannon) as Harlan's children; Richard (Johnson), Joni (Collette) and Donna (Lindhome) as their partners; Randsom (Evans), Meg (Langford) and Jacob (Martell) as Harlan's grandchildren. I think that the main 12 characters - needless to say, not everyone gets enough time to shine, as the focus is on Blanc and Marta trying to piece everything together.This is Johnson's first film since 'The Last Jedi' and it's very assured - excellent set design and cinematography, with a simple score. The hose is literally a life-size Cluedo game. The film drags a tiny bit in the 2nd act, but comes home strong. There's plenty of fun had by the cast and Craig clearly relishes the non-Bond role - even if his Southern accent gets annoying at times! Satisfying ending - nothing revolutionary, but enjoyable.

Truly a masterpiece of subverting expectations.,"Knives Out tells the story of the Thrombey's, an upper class family of wealth and importance celebrating the 85th birthday of the patriarch Harlan (Plummer), a day later Harlan is found with his throat slit and every one in the family, including the servants becomes a suspect, as they all have motive.It is very unique to see a murder mystery that is completely original, not a book adaptation nor a property of long standing fiction. These are original character in a pretty tired premise. When I walked into the theatre I was expecting this to play out like any old game of clue, or Sherlock, with Benoit Blanc (Craig) playing the eccentric private detective that puts every piece together in the end. However by deviating away from the traditional mystery formula, along with a great score and masterful/controlled camerawork, it really unravels its performances and characters in a funny and suspenseful way.This is a stellar cast, the two shining members being Chris Evans as Ransom Drysdale the spoiled grandson of Harlan and Daniel Craig as the inconsiderate southern detective. Both of them are playing against their type are truly transformative in their roles. They were not James Bond or Captain America, they were two people trying to figure out how to solve the mystery looming above them. The supporting characters are also great, Don Johnson, Jamie Lee Curtis, Michael Shannon, Toni Collette, LaKeith Stanfield and Ana de Armas as the son-in law, daughter, son, daughter-in-law, crime scene investigator and Harlan's caretaker do not just blend into the movie as they have clear personalities and motives for what they want to do. However some of the cast do just disappear into the movie, particularly Katherine Langford and Jaeden Martell as the other two grandchildren.Given the movie's affinity for subverting expectations, it may render some plot points moot or unimportant at times. Knives Out is no exception, this movie would set up some plot points that would make the mystery loom and linger on, however when everything is revealed these plot points may not get the resolution they deserve. Also some characters really only exist for four or five lines/jokes and then are basically forgotten about by the end. However this might be because of the visual storytelling at the end. With the right context and clues, the audience can infer the real ending, based on nothing but facial expressions, prop treatment and setting displacement. This is how we know we have a true master of acting and directing, when an object is shown and it gives us much more can be deduced than just what is seen on screen.Without spoiling anything, don't go into this movie expecting a traditional murder mystery, the trailers really set it up to be one, but this is a Rian Johnson film. I understand why people were peeved at him for his treatment of Star Wars, mainly because his subversion of expectations made them mad, as people grew up with the characters and story, so in a sense they belong to the public and they didn't like the liberties he took with the new additions he made. But these characters and this story belong to him and he can do whatever he wants with them. In fact the less you know, the better. Expect some foul play.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

A Recommendation - Knives Out (2019),"Knives Out is a film in which Rian Johnson, formerly of Star Wars: The Last Jedi and Looper fame, redirects the main points of contention from his previous outings into a more suitable genre for his particular brand of directorial vision - a whodunit Agatha Christie-inspired murder mystery. As such, the less one knows about it - the better, but since this is a recommendation, perhaps the deal needs to be sweetened, before you are fully convinced that the film is worth your time. What follows will probably diminish your viewing enjoyment.
Featuring a star-studded cast, Knives Out spins a delightful web of intrigue surrounding the sudden death of the eldest member of the Thrombey family - Harlan, a writer and proprietor of a publishing company as well as vast amounts of wealth. Contentions arise concerning his will and the distribution of inheritance, as things usually go.Through a series of interviews with his decedents, one begins to paint a picture of the events that transpired on that very night. Said interviews are so cleverly bolstered by the films clever editing scheme, displaying just enough information to keep you interested, but reward you for being observant as well. One could go as far to say that part of the subtle humor of the film is a direct consequence of one paying attention to details and remembering what seemed to be insignificant red-herrings beforehand. It is honest to god fun to see Rian Johnson subvert and twist away in a genre that was built on exactly that ever-shifting foundation, rather than more generic linear narratives. The amount of foreshadowing and Chekhov's guns littered around is nothing short of amazing, whenever the guns do in fact go off in the third act.The film isn't without action, as everyone scrambles to uncover the truth, usually getting themselves caught in situations they'd rather not be in. There are thrills and suspense waiting around every corner, as you begin to believe you've finally got it and a new lead opens up unexpectedly from the unlikeliest of sources.
This is no less a product of the film's wonderful script, which features clever word-play galore, giving everyone a wonderfully fleshed out persona with its own unique quirks and still maintaining a level of realism in their depiction as real people. The performances also lend themselves nicely to the often quippy nature of every line of dialogue. Many battles of wit are held with a level of wordsmanship that leaves you laughing or shivering on a constant basis.The film even pays homage to the pieces of media that inspired the genre in some less that subtle ways; like the single-color attire everyone seems to wear and the wildly different personalities, reminiscent of Clue (1985) or the bearded sailor dummy referencing 1972's Sleuth, and many more.
The soundtrack is frankly very traditional, in the way that it plays it straight, by relying mostly on orchestral strings and short spirts of piano. It serves its purpose well in establishing tension whilst also maintaining this ever-present whimsy, but regretfully falls on the not-so-memorable side of things. A fitting score, but probably not something you would be listening to in your free time.An overall fantastic time with a film that wraps up nicely, accomplishing everything that it set out to do. If not one of the best original screenplays of the year, it is definitely one with heart and a good sense of humor. A wonderful murder mystery that keeps you asking questions and rewards you for noticing its intricate details in a way that nothing has done for quite some time. Rian Johnson shows his true talent in flamboyant display of filmmaking, that will keep you enamored until the very end. Watch it!",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

Tried to be a whodunnit film but ends up being nothing more than a good comedy,"Wow! Every single time I thought that the story had nothing left to offer and it seems like I got it all figured out, the plot would through a new curved ball again and again until it simply dumped the entire basket over my head in an exciting finale. The entite 2 hours I kept coming up with new theories and conspiracies as I was absorbed in the experience of mystery, humor and the performance of the actors. After that experience ended, I began to think about what I just watched and thats where everything changed.Knives Out is a whodunnit film so naturally, while I was driving home, I put on my detective hat and began inspecting the clues, details and plot elements. The film manages to skillfully distract the audience from its faults during crucial elements by turning up the comedy factor and speeding up the pace. As a result, you wont even notice the mistakes until the end when you are able to think clearly.What really takes away from all the suspense, mystery and the essence of the film is the political aspect of this film. Instead of being a gritty Agatha Christie styled investigation film, it feels like a Cinderella fairy tale with quirkycharacters. Sometimes, a movie needs to have only one theme. All that being said, I still recommend Knives Out as it is upbeat, funny and most importantly intriguing all the way until the credits. A good comedy to watch with friends or family.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Overrated and Boring,Not sure how this film has managed to get anywhere near to an 8 - it is a very dull film that thinks it is cleverer than it actually is! Not a case of Whodunit but more like Whocares.,1.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
True to its title,"Knives Out is entertaining, charming, and endearing. It keeps you guessing and every its plot is well-paced with twists: some you expect, some you don't. The ones you expect are more complex than they appear, and the ones you don't see are clever enough to keep you thinking.Craig is marvelous, and de Armas keeps her mystique from 2049. The ensemble has mesmerizing give and take which leaves for some genuinely inspiring scenes - if not for their content, but for their development.Its parts are great, and as a sum of its parts, it's magnificent. This well-timed, perfectly-lit film will have your face smiling, your mind racing, and the theater reeling.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
I suspect acclaim.,"'Knives Out (2019)' is the kind of movie they don't make anymore, a mansion-based whodunnit with an all-star cast and a charismatically quirky lead, but that doesn't mean it's old-fashioned. In fact, it feels fresh, modern and genre-literate. It uses its cinematic awareness to craft a devilishly enjoyable fable, a fun and evolving mystery that delivers the goods on pretty much all fronts. Despite what the marketing would have you believe, Daniel ""Bored Of Bond"" Craig isn't the protagonist. This makes for a detective story in which the detective isn't the one you want to see succeed, even though he isn't an antagonist in any shape or form, and this is rather refreshing. By giving certain aspects of its story away shockingly early, the flick leans away from suspicion and head-first into suspense. Johnson still manages to add an ample amount of wrinkles to the plot as it thickens, though. It's unpredictable and engaging throughout, peppered with the sort of surprises that the genre demands. Even though it does end with the typical, detective-led exposition dump, it's an incredibly satisfying experience. This is primarily because you're always engaged by proceedings, kept on your toes as the ultimately rather unique story unravels. It's a crowd-pleasing affair, a clever twist on its well-worn premise that still conforms to certain expectations. It's also fairly well-written, dialogue-heavy but not plodding, and has a good sense of tone, playing with the absurdities of Cluedo-esque situations without reducing its overall sincerity. It's aware of what it is but it isn't annoyingly meta. The crisp cinematography compliments its almost timeless feel, while the assured direction establishes itself as stylish yet subdued. Every core player plays their role excellently, no matter how much time or attention they're actually awarded. That includes the previously mentioned Craig, whose chewy southern drawl actually isn't as distracting as it could have been. Shannon, Evans, Plummer and De Armas stand out as being particularly good, too, regardless of the size of their role. Much of the family is side-lined for the majority of the time, but their presence is still keenly felt and they sufficiently support the more important characters. It's hard to imagine a cast better than this and everyone delivers on the unspoken promise of their inclusion. In the end, this is a surprisingly intelligent and entertaining experience. It generally keeps getting better as it goes on. When everything falls into place, it's hard not to get a smile on your face. It's great. 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Not what I expected,"When I first heard about this movie, I thought, oh, ok, another murder mystery movie. It looked good and thought. Ya, I'll see it.

A funny clever interesting story to watch,"The movie is very intelligent
I liked every part of the movie , the start , the middle and the ending.
The story is simple as it's a death of a man to be investigated. everything seems to be taking us into a normal story where you keep searching for the killer till you reach the killer in the end , however it's a very new plot that I've not seen like before.
even though it looks similar to A murder on the orient express movie however it's much better , every character has a significant role to play , you can't take any character out of the movie even the one who was found dead in the beginning of the movie. The flash back technique is very well used in the movie , you can't feel like it's overused or something , it's very useful and brings more interesting facts during the movie.
The plot is one of the best to watch in such kind of movies.
Even the comedy is very well used and really very funny in the scenes it was used for.I really enjoyed the movie and really encourage every one to watch and enjoy it.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Treading water,There was no nerve in this film. And the actors was underused. I guess it was some kind of Orient Express inspired screenplay but to compete with Agatha Christie is(even if you put a Agatha look a like in the film)pure hubris of some dimension. There is no real finesse about the film and to have Daniel Craig talk in some southern dialect make no sense. Is it supposed to be funny?Doesn't add anything to this strained and rather dull movie.

Knives Out has become a comfort movie for me in the last year and was actually the last film I saw in theaters pre-quarantine (on NYE with the theatrical director's commentary that was available for download on the Knives Out website). I absolutely love it, from the unique yet believable characters to the intriguing location filled with new details to notice every time you watch to Daniel Craig's accent and Chris Evan's sweater.

Excellent murder-drama,"Successful, extremely wealthy, crime-novelist Harlan Thrombey is found dead with his throat cut. The most likely cause is suicide but famed detective Benoit Blanc has been hired to investigate whether he was murdered or not. At least four of his relatives have a motive. Blanc finds an ally and useful source of information in Marta, Harlan Thrombey's nurse. However, Marta may know more than she is letting on.Excellent murder-drama, written and directed by Rian Johnson. Highly original and intelligent plot that starts like a Hercule Poirot mystery but pretty quickly follows its own unique track. Quite clever audience manipulation by Johnson: you think you have it all sussed out...but you don't. Wonderfully unpredictable and murky, while appearing transparent.All-star cast delivers in spades. Daniel Craig is great as Benoit Blanc, putting on a southern accent and pulling it off with aplomb. Supporting cast includes Don Johnson, Jamie Lee Curtis, Chris Evans, Michael Shannon, Toni Collette and Christopher Plummer and none of them put a foot wrong. The stand-out, however, is by the least-known cast member: Ana De Armas as Marta.

Quite good whodunit,"This movie actually does something quite interesting, it tells you whodunit right up front.

Actors are all great in their roles , although most are barely on screen and that's a shame with such a great cast . But it flows very well and things find a way to make the audience react at the right moments , this is due to some nicely directed moments and some perfectly read dialogue. I would have loved this film and given it a much higher score if it just had a little something more . If the twist wasn't so damn noticable to the point of making you say 'it can't be that because it's to obvious' . If there was just a tad more meat on its bones.

A fun whodunnit movie,"So I finally got to the movie theater and saw Knives Out. With a huge all star cast. This movie is a whodunnit. The movie stars Chris Evans, Jamie Lee Curtis, Don Johnson, & Christopher Plummer. The storyline is a famous Arthur supposedly committed suicide. But there is a fowl play. Who killed Harlem? Now this is a fun movie. Entertaining as hell. Daniel Craig is superb as the detective. The cast of characters are fun to watch. Especially Chris Evans, Don Johnson and Michael Shannon. The storyline is good, the whodunnit concept was good, but to me it was easy to pick who did it? Did you guess right? The directions by Rian Johnson was great. Loved the angles and shots he did. This is a fun movie ride. You will love all the characters and the ending to this whodunnit. My rating is 8/10.

Knives Out,"Hidden in the image of paying homage to the traditional British reasoning novels and movies, it is actually a wanton rebellion against this classic type.

It's never boring but take a few steps back and it falls apart.,"When I was watching this movie I enjoyed most of the dialogue the character interactions but then when it was all said and done I realized it didn't amount to much. There were way too many convenient plot devices that made it seem a little contrived. I think the whole thing fell apart at the end when to me it stopped being believable and turned a little silly.Rian Johnson is probably one of the most politically correct filmmakers in Hollywood right now and I think that greatly limits the effectiveness of his movies because of the rules he sets for himself. I think there were a lot of good opportunities squandered in Knives Out. There were some very interesting characters that were wasted in the favor of the story being focused on a very bland albeit pretty one. For me it just ultimately didn't deliver a satisfying experience, mostly entertaining but forgettable. 6/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
A very pleasant watch,"A very pleasant watch with decent performances, good dialogue and a fantastic set. Indeed the house with its painted wood walls, books and nick-nacks everywhere and filled to overflowing with interesting items is a marvellous background for all that happens and we feel somewhat bereft when the action switches to the highway towards the end. Ana de Armas is brilliant and her performance not only holds the attention but holds the film together. Daniel Craig is ostensibly the main star but his performance as the eccentric private detective who will solves everything is not strong enough and this allows de Armas to dominate, which I'm sure was the director's intention. Chris Evans is surprisingly good as the errant sone while Jamie Lee Curtis leads the older members of the awful family.

Entertaining quirky a bit too clever,"My Review -Knives Out
My Rating 7:10I'm a little either side of appreciating this film it's very entertaining and well acted with a great cast including Daniel Craig who is very good as the Colonel Sanders Hercule Poirot also Jamie Lee Curtis as Linda Drysdale the matriarch of a dysfunctional family of self centred opportunistic characters .They are joined by Toni Collette, Christopher Plummer,Chris Evans and Anna De Armas as the Carer to the elderly rich author Harlem Thromby.No spoilers here I'm still thinking about the outcome and a little confused but my fellow movie viewing partner says it's more a retro crime comedy so perhaps I'm looking for logic where I shouldn't be.The Director also wrote the screenplay Rian Johnson who also wrote and directed the 3 episodes of the Breaking Bad series and Star Wars V111 The Last Jedi .
So tons of talented people involved in this entertaining film but to me it was a little like watching a film of a good stage play at times and I thought trying to be a little too clever for its own good",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Not so cleverly constructed,"'Knives Out' is a (barely) contemporary twist on the Agatha Christie template: a country house, a rich dead man, all the family are suspects, and a famous detective is fortunately on hand to sort things out. It's always hokum, but it can be fun when done well. But I didn't find this film a success. The detective had no good reason to be present, for a start (and I didn't find Daniel Craig convincing as an American southerner either). More than that, we learn that the first explanation (the one that only exists to be proven wrong) is false at the moment it is offered to us, meaning that the grand reveal of the full truth upturns nothing of consequence. And the central plot device - a woman who can't lie without vomiting - is not only bizarre, it also means the hero and the audience alike get a pretty preposterous head start on what's really going on. It's entertaining enough; but insufficiently clever as to transcend its inherent ridiculousness.",5.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

Rian Johnson made something that could take to the stage someday, and I think it's that kind of audience that this would compel most.To say that it delivered would be an understatement. Every minute of the run time mattered. It had this interesting way in which information was revealed in a front-loaded fashion, and yet still left you with necessary questions that you couldn't dodge, and you constantly questioned with the people around you.

"Not Brilliant, not horrible, just kinda meh.","Who dunnit like a good whodunnit? (See what I did there?)Knives out looks great on paper. Ensemble cast filled with great talent, all sure to be delivering quirky, eccentric performances through a roller coster plot with a twist at the end. What could go wrong?Overall, I thought the actors delivered well, no real faults. Indeed, the performances are all the more impressive considering some of the odd casting.
Craig, who was horribly miscast, puts on an unexpectedly enjoyable performance as a sleuth from the Louisiana Bayou. de Armas puts on a very strong performance despite the horrible character device she was handicapped. Special mention for Evans who does a wonderful turn as creepy bad guy. Clearly Evans has been miscast in the past in all those hero roles.The dialog is decent enough as well. A wee bit Hollywood at times but not achingly so. And a fair amount of good jabs as the quirky characters cut into each other.And I'll tip my hat for good cinematography. The film did look wonderful.So what went wrong? In a word, the plot. Points for novelty, but the circumstance is just too improbable to accept Plummer's reactions. But that really isn't the worst of the film. The biggest problem is that the plot places far too much of the story on de Armas' character. So much so that all the other characters fall away and become largely irrelevant. And when one particular character stands up to assist de Armas, well, you know then and there whodunnit. That whole ensemble cast, who each should have been vying for a place as the bad guy right up until the very end, instead relegated to a bit of shouting and noise from the sideline. It's the pre-school toddler's, 9 piece puzzle version of a whodunnit.There you go, a fair and honest review without mentioning Rian or Star Wars........",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

'You have a regurgitative reaction to mistruths',"Rian Johnson both wrote and directed this tantalizing mystery KNIVES OUT that resurrects the memory of Dame Agatha Christie, the Queen of mystery writers. For those who disbelieve his stature in this film, see it now. He has created a detective figure in Benoit Blanc that rivals Hercule Poirot!As much a story about a dysfunctional family's greed as a detective tale, the story (as briefly as is possible without committing spoilers) is condensed by Lionsgate as follows: 'When renowned crime novelist Harlan Thrombey (Christopher Plummer) is found dead at his estate just after his 85th birthday, the inquisitive and debonair Detective Benoit Blanc (Daniel Craig) is mysteriously enlisted to investigate. From Harlan's dysfunctional family to his devoted staff, Blanc sifts through a web of red herrings and self-serving lies to uncover the truth behind Harlan's untimely death.' But that outline fails to focus on the intricate personality dissections of Harlan's family - and house staff: the shrewish Linda (Jamie Lee Curtis) and her cheating husband Richard (Don Johnson) and their finagling son Ransom (Chris Evans); the vitriolic son Walt (Michael Shannon) and his wily wife Joni (Toni Collette) and their children Meg (Katherine Langford) and Jacob (Jaeden Martell) and Donna (Riki Lindhome); and Harlan's ancient mother Greatnana Wanette (K Calllan). Add to the mix the policemen (LaKeith Stanfield and Noah Segan), the house staff- healthcare nurse Marta Cabrera (Ana de Armas) and housekeeper Fran (Edi Patterson) and everyone has a fine reason for wanting to see Harlan Thrombey dead!Daniel Craig shines as Benoit Blanc, despite an at times annoying overly Southern drawl, as does Ana de Armas, and the manner in which he pieces together the mystery is spot on. Excellent concept, spirited dialogue, and exceptional acting and cinematography make this a complete winner of a movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

Screenplay - 5Overall Review - 6/10My thoughtsI liked the movie, but I didn't love it.The mystery is introduced within the first few minutes, and all the characters, and world in which they live-in within the first ten minutes, so the movie starts great. But then the movie makes a bizarre narrative choice: It starts revealing crucial moments, and even the big reveal of 'who done it?', in flashbacks. So by the end of first half an hour, you know the whole mystery; and there lies the problem. Because We as a viewer, knows the mystery, the movie starts to loose interest, at least it did for me. And by the end, you are just waiting for the movie to end. Even the secondary reveals are not as impactful as they should be, because we as a viewer have lost interest by the time they are revealed.I thought everyone acted superbly. I really liked all the performance. No stand out though.The movie was a fun watch, quite literally. I laughed a few times. But overall the bizarre choice of revealing the mystery so early, was the
worst decision Rian Johnson could have made.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

He needs to stick with playing James Bond, where his poor acting skill is partially covered by the continuing action scenes. I can't begin to understand why Craig was cast in such a key role.

A Fun Old-School Mystery With Enough Twists to Keep You Guessing,"If you saw the marketing material for Knives Out, it pitches you on a classic whodunit. All of the characters have something to hide, things are often not as they appear and there's going to be a big twist at the end. Some of these elements are in Knives Out but this is a rare case in that it looks like a whodunit, sounds like a whodunit but is actually something else. They don't go the expected route and they reveal the nature of the crime much earlier than you would expect them to. It was a nice choice to subvert expectations, I was a little disappointed but they brought me around on it by the end. So adjust your line of thinking going into Knives Out, you might think you have it figured out but trust me when I say ""THE GAME'S AFOOT.""We also get a classic setup for the characters motivations, it was a nice blend of what you expect and something new. A fortune is at stake, everyone has something to gain from Harlan's death and when the shoe drops, no one is completely forthcoming. There's some depth given to all the players, I was surprised that Michael Shannon or Toni Collette weren't given more to go off of but we learn enough about them to understand why everyone is a suspect. I did get a little annoyed with how everyone was constantly lying or snickering when Blanc looked away, it shifted my thinking into suspecting many parties being involved when the reality was much more simple. There are so many red herrings that it was tiresome to keep up but I do think the ending delivered the desired payoff.The cast of this movie doesn't compare to the Avengers or you're average Marvel team up but you're going to recognize most of this cast and they've all given memorable performances in other films. I'd classify Daniel Craig as the lead and he's pitch perfect as Blanc. He gets the opportunity to be a little more laid back and comedic compared to James Bond and between this and Logan Lucky, he's got the range to pull this off. I really enjoyed the energy he brought to his character and I tip my hat to him for stretching a little in Knives Out. Ana de Armas gets the next most screen time and I thought she was good as well. She's dressed down and the role is much less glamorous than something like Blade Runner 2049 and she appropriately adapts. She's decent at being mousy and reserved and she added a lot to this movie. Chris Evans is in the cast, he's more sarcastic than when he's playing Cap but this was a nice return to a more Johnny Storm or Jensen character. But he also has to get serious and if you haven't seen his more dramatic work, he's more than capable of that and he delivers. Christopher Plummer was in the movie more than I thought he would be, he's a theatrical treasure, of course he was great. The rest of the supporting cast gets less to work with than you would think, they all get their moments but they're collectively good as opposed to 1 or 2 standout performances (all of them were good at giving the shifty-eye and twirling their respective moustaches).The best setting for a murder mystery is always a big mansion on a dark and stormy night. Knives Out has that classic kind of flavour, it isn't afraid to steer into tropes while avoiding others. I really liked the setting, it was fun and there's a lot of atmosphere despite the movie only featuring a few locations. The house becomes another character on the screen and this can be important in helping bring you into this world. The movie is shot well on top of this, the costuming and the set dressing is what you would picture in a game of Clue (it was referenced in the movie), it was only missing a ball and a character in a tuxedo. It's edited and scored to grow the tension and even though I would describe it as more workmanlike than fantastic, there were few missteps or problems which is a credit to the movie.I was pleasantly surprised by Knives Out. Despite the overwhelmingly positive critical response, I was happy to catch this when it was on streaming services. A friend of mine was eager to see it though and I'm glad he convinced me to go. I'm glad Rian Johnson got the opportunity to bounce back (I don't want to comment on the Last Jedi, my review is on the site and the screaming of opposing opinions on both sides about The Last Jedi robbed me of my enjoyment of Star Wars, thanks a lot for that everyone). I like a good murder mystery but I have a hard time reading the genre due the trope heavy kind of writing it requires. This carries over into movies but I have to admit when they're done right, they can be breathtaking (Gone Girl, A Simple Favour are both excellent movies that have come out recently). If I were looking for a comparison, it shares a lot in common with Murder on the Orient Express (the 2017 Kenneth Branagh directed movie) and I would pick Knives Out as the better effort. The cast looks like their having a blast, the characters are diverse and mysterious, the story is engaging and features enough curve balls to keep the reveal a mystery and the setting is a fun old school throwback that I enjoyed as well. Knives Out is a fun couple of hours at the theatre, its not a towering achievement in cinema or a masterpiece of screenwriting but its a well thrown change-up leading into the December ""award"" season. I'd rate Knives Out between a 8-9/10 but I'm going to round down until I see it a 2nd time, I don't know if it will hold up as well to repeat viewings. If you're interested, I'd recommend checking it out in theatres",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

Daniel craig made it worth it.,"Like the title said, Daniel Craig was really good in this movie. chris evans and armas made it kinda hard to watch and made it all seem long and dragged out. It looks like a rather amazing cast on paper but it just feels like it isn't playing to it's strengths and some of these rather secondary characters shows a lot of personality that you'd expect, but then seem to fade away in the story. having someone like LaKeith Stanfield in the movie and only using him to ask stupid questions, it just seem like such a waste of talent. It's not a bad movie and it does achieve somewhat what it tried to. would probably rate it somewhere between a 6 and 7.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

I couldn't have cared less about any of the characters or how the old bloke died.Amateurish acting and Daniel Craig's accent was shockingly bad. I always thought he was a good actor but after this shambles I have changed my point of view.The film dragged on and on and on with very predictable twists here and there, but due to poor character development and as all were totally dislikeable why would we care. Obviously we are supposed to root for the nurse but whatever.Don't believe the hype with this.

By far and away the best film of 2019,"Using the form of the whodunit Johnson's crafts a black comedy that it is at once a startling deconstuction of the genre and a reconstruction of the same to make a political parable about entitlement and just desserts. It is exceptionally difficult to explain the brilliance of this film without spoilers but the more you think you know what is going on or who is the bad person is the more the film will trick you. There is a central moment of the film that depends on an *extremely* clever use of expectations molding perceptions to hide what is going on and it is the single greatest moment in cinema this year. The script is a masterwork of layered meaning, jokes and characterizations. Simply word choice reveals so much-for a benign example the family's cruelty and indifference towards Marta is revealed in that none of them get the country she is from correct. There are roughly a dozen characters in this film and you feel as if you come to know all of them. And as meta as the film gets it is no mere shell game of playing around with tropes. The film at its core is discussing the ways in which race, material wealth breed resentment and cruelty. The final shot is a massive rebuke of Trumpianism and the film is like a dagger to the heart of some of the worst people in our society; this is a social satire of the first order. The shade of the final moment is thrown in righteous anger. It is simply great.Johnson, as a director, never lets the film dwell on its political import. Indeed, visually the film is an exceptionally crafted mood piece that combines classic compositions and style to create an atmosphere that is simply fun. You can almost feel Johnson robbing his hands together in delight. The visual construct is as clever as the writing in places. Each supports the other to such a degree that the film feels formed directly from Johnson's mind. The circle of knives is not only a striking central visual but it is part of the fun. It just looks cool and means something. This is a film that has a lot on its mind but finds its delights in delighting its viewers.And I have not even mentioned the best part. The acting is gobsmacking perfect. The entire cast is just so good in this. They all deftly blend the comedic and mystery elements. They hide the red herrings well. They all are having so much fun. It is unfair to select any one performance but de Armas is perfect in this. She makes a weird quirk believable. She is tough as nails, smart as a whip and vulnerable. Evans plays against type to a wonderful effect. Oh and Daniel Craig's Blanc is the funniest most endearing detective in about 30 years.I am so glad I decided to give Johnson the benefit of the doubt and see this!",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

An early twist in the plot puts this film on another level, distinguishing it from other murder mysteries and making it a unique experience. The characters are very distinctive, and the brisk pace means that the 130 minute runtime is never boring.

Knives Out is a wickedly fun masterpiece.,"""Knives Out"" Review
(9/10)KNIVES OUT LEADS VIEWERS ON A THRILLING AND WICKEDLY FUN RIDE AS THE ENTIRE ENSEMBLE OFFERS BREATHTAKING PERFORMANCES IN THIS WHODUNNIT MYSTERY.
Though Rian Johnson is now perhaps best known for having directed Star Wars: The Last Jedi, across all his films, Johnson incorporates story elements that subvert expectations, delivering twists viewers won't see coming. That's all to say, Knives Out fits perfectly within his wheelhouse as a modern murder mystery whodunnit thriller. Written, directed and produced by Johnson, the filmmaker also surrounds himself with an astonishingly talented ensemble cast, who execute his vision with masterful precision.
Johnson's particular talent of keeping audiences on their toes is on full display with Knives Out, which follows a fairly standard formula for murder mystery movies - in that the viewers are shown little bits about the night of the murder as the mystery is slowly unraveled on screen. The filmmaker uses a deft hand in both setting up and pulling off the twists in Knives Out, laying the foundation for them long before viewers even see them coming. Astute audiences, especially those that revel in solving a murder mystery plot before the characters on screen, will pick up on the clues, but Johnson uses their expectations against them to keep even those viewers guessing.
In a film with plenty of colorful characters, Craig's Blanc is an energetic scene-stealer, even as de Armas' Marta is presented more as the film's protagonist. The actress and her more understated performance work well to make Marta the most grounded character in Knives Out, contrasting well against the more campy, over-the-top members of the Thrombey family. Collette's Joni is another scene-stealer, dropping a surprising number of one-liners, as Curtis's Linda is a more imposing woman - though her performance is just as fun.
Every aspect of Knives Out - from Johnson's directing and Craig's southern drawl to the satisfyingly chilling score and intricately detailed set design - comes together to form this lush, captivating murder mystery. Knives Out manages to combine the campy fun of Clue with a new and carefully crafted mystery, plus infuse some commentary about everything from detective stories to modern American politics, all while allowing Johnson's filmmaking voice to shine through. In the end, Knives Out is a wickedly fun masterpiece.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Murder mystery done right,"Well, this is a fantastic piece of murder mystery theatre piece-of-art I've seen for a good long while. We all know that when you want an ensemble of complex characters that need to be whittled down to a single guilty party you type to Agatha Christie. Shes the best in the genre of murder mysteries; you think 1920 or 30s England, with all the drama and drastic class divisions... and yet, here is a modern tale that holds suspense and tension incredible well that also has said genre conventions in, however it is still told in the modern age. Rian Johnson has told a story with all the intricate details pointing towards one person but you'll find yourself guessing who caused Harlan's death right up until the final chapter is told.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
A gem in the mistery genre,"What is the big deal with this movie? No CGI, no shooting and explosions, how can anyone rate it so high?Well... It's the story.

It doesn't have stupid gaps. It's surprising.It's a mistery, but you dont'y know it's a mistery until the story comes together in a perfect circle in the end. And it just makes sense.Ana de Armas is lovely, and you can't help loving her, and understand why, the other characters genuinely like her, in spide of being mostly a bunch of jerks.Daniel Craig.... hum.

Gets Better with Every Viewing,"From the very first minutes Knives Out presents itself as a clear cut detective murder mystery, with well rounded humor. Initially everything seems almost a little too clich√©, until the second act begins and we're introduced to the true plot of the film. I won't spoil it for you, though I must admit I didn't see that one coming, and I'm rarely caught off guard.When the twist arrives the entire narrative actually does a 180¬∞ turn, and I found myself genuinely invested, and interested to find out where the story was headed. Knives Out seemingly effortlessly turns almost all of its genre based weaknesses into strengths, in a spectacularly enthralling cinematic fashion.The entire viewing experience is just so refreshingly rewarding, and from the marvelous performances to the entire visual presentation. With the stellar set design, editing, camera, writing, and Rian Johnson's great direction, there is hardly anything left to be desired.I can't recommend this one enough.

Wonderfully colorful story with entertainment for the whole family!,"Meet the Thrombey's... Although pretty late to the party, I was just on time to catch this hilarious, who-done-it mystery movie before it slipped out of theaters and I was totally impressed. Having been exposed to various members of this ensemble cast at some point in their careers I was excited to see how they would be able to co-exist onscreen as an acting family unit.The accomplished and versatile ensemble cast is one of the many reasons to see this, with Toni Collette, who left so many speechless with her performance in Hereditary, or Katherine Langford who played the vitally important role of Leah in Love Simon, to veteran actors Don Johnson, Jamie Lee Curtis, and Michael Shannon, the film seems to have the right actors to carry the story along. Most people will have seen Daniel Craig act in his many roles as James Bond over the years, but they will be in for a pleasant surprise at his ability to play a quirky detective with a southern drawl and a penchant for finding the truth, no matter where it may lead him. Audiences will too have seen Chris Evans play Captain America in his many appearances in those movies of the Marvel Cinema Universe, but they will again be perturbed and flummoxed at the impressive quality with which Evans' is able to bring his character in Knives Out, Ransom, to life.Director Rian Johnson hosted a 23 minute video with Vanity Fair where he broke down a scene in the film, which is highly worth seeing (Before or after viewing, no spoilers!), in it he offers his insight into how the scene was setup from where the cameras were being pointed, to how it was working with all of the talent, to the behind the scenes ""movie magic"" that we don't get to see. It was fantastic to see how excited he was about explaining some of the minute details of what went into making Knives Out, which in turn allowed for more of his voice to come out and be evident when watching the film. He really is an exceptional director, who we should expect more big things from in the future.Ana de Armas, who plays Marta Cabrera, has to be mentioned here, not only because she's the leading actress of the movie, but because she steals the show despite being listed third on the movie's first billed cast list. Although, she occupies a substantial amount of screen time Armas uses many subtle acting skills to bring power and depth to her role, which is important to the development of the films story.Like the above poster shows, Knives Out is a robust, dynamic multi-genre movie that has something for everybody. I saw ""multi-genre"" because it's not just a drama, it has too many comedic elements to be pigeonholed into solely that category. Additionally, it's not exclusively a thriller or mystery movie, because at it's core it's truly a family ""dram-edy"" about a mysterious, thrilling event that happens to the family.. I won't confuse you anymore, but what I'm trying to say is that Knives Out is a great American movie with something for all audiences. See it when you have the chance.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Well worth a Watch - from a confirmed Whodunnit fan :),"I've enjoyed a good whodunnit since the days of Margaret Rutherford as Miss Marple. Over the years, various versions of Marple, Poirot, Holmes, etc have been a bit of a mishmash. Some very good, some acceptable, and some that really gall. I was dubious about this one - Modern, Daniel Craig as a PI (!), and likely some moronic script with either gaping holes in the plot or an obvious murderer in 5 minutes. Well, I give it big thumbs up! It's a good plot, a good bunch of characters, and the story flows well. It really is a good modern take on the genre. I think for those that like the Agatha Christie screen versions (I never liked the books) you will enjoy it - it's refreshingly very good. For those that don't like the Agatha Christie I think you will like it because it has extra humour and feels modern. Get past Daniel Craigs accent and enjoy :)",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
"In an era of self-reflection on the movie media, this movie dared!","Knives out is such an interesting movie in our film environment today. In an era of making fun of everything before and break patterns left and right, most end up doing it in the safest ways possible. Knives Out says hold my beer and takes the ""who donit?"" and turns it sideways. I didn't vibe with everything the movie dose, but I respect it no doubt.After the death of a famous murder mystery writer, a detective trues to find out who did it of his left behind family who all expect something of him.The script and dialogue is so amazing here. It¬¥s a cleverly written movie with so many details to it. Sharpen your ears, pay attention, and you¬¥ll appreciate how well the plot is written. The dialogue of the family members are so great and contradict each other constantly. It¬¥s incredible how tight the script must be and it creates an amazing opening to the movie.The family members are all portraited amazingly. Every actor hit their character home and make them all stand out and feel unique. This together with great costuming creates a very unique looking and felling movie like the board game Clue being played out in front of you. The detective Blanc, played by Daniel Craig is an amazing character and the standout role here. He captures the old sherlock Holmesy sophisticated vibe so well and his a joy to listen to and watch.I personally didn't vibe well with what the movie did. It tells a murder mystery in it¬¥s own way and it just ended up frustrating me. I think the idea is good and works for the movie, but it didn't land for me and created a frustrating passing and plot to me.The set design is incredible. Everything at the manor the movie takes place in, looks like what a murder mystery house should look like. Big, full of hidden things. Statues of animals, paintings of the owner, dulls, just a pure joy to see. It creates these incredible scenes and shots. Just take the opening shot, it¬¥s insane.The score is also just fun to listen to. The use of strings is nice, and it really fits the movie.I also really liked the underplayed humor. It¬¥s more of a cringe/understated humor that I appreciated. It¬¥s the awkwardness of family and people not clashing that creates the humor here.Knives out is a good and enjoyable movie. It¬¥s a feast for the eyes and very fun and interesting. I just didn't fall in love with the idea and what it tried to do, I found it frustrating and made the movie feel slow to me.

Entertaining movie,"Like all crime movies, this contains plot twists, some major, some minor. I can say that most of the spoilers were, quite honestly, surprising to me, and I did like the movie overall and Craig's and Chris Evans' performance were good. However, I did predict one of the main plot twists from the beginning which made the movie from that point on to be not as enjoyable as it was before. Although because I didn't reach the right conclusions from the plot twist that I knew, the hole in the donut if you will, was coming, it was still enjoyable as a whole (pun intended.).

Murder Mystery With An All Star Cast,"Knives Out is a murder mystery film with an all star cast including Daniel Craig, Christopher Plummer, Chris Evans, Jamie Lee Curtis, Don Johnson and Michael Shannon. It centres around the death of Plummer shortly after his 85th birthday. Craig plays the investigating detective and his performance is good but the accent he puts on is nothing short of horrendous. Plummer is good as usual, and in fact not one member of the cast puts in a weak performance. Chris Evans plays against type and his performance lifts the second half of the film and drives the plot forward. At times i found Knives Out a little convoluted and the comedic aspects didn't always work. However it is undeniably well made and well shot and doesn't feel too long with a 2 hour runtime. You certainly have to pay attention to the film as the plot moves from the present to the past with red herrings thrown in. Undeniably a good film Knives Out falls short of being great, but it is certainly refreshing to have a film which is not a superhero film or a film full of CGI.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Cinematography is good. Otherwise...,"This is a highly acclaimed movie and I can't say I understand why. The main character Marta has a rare vomiting condition that seems a little odd and could actually have been used by the police at the beginning of the film to get the whole story. I have no idea why Marta would trust Ransom (Chris Evans) when he shows up. The story begins with setting up some of the characters as possible suspects (Don Johnson, Jamie Lee Curtis, Toni Collette), and then resolves them pretty quickly after that, so what was the point of having these red herrings? Pretty well everyone in the family is unlikeable. I think morphine hits you pretty quickly so when Christopher Plummer is still on his feet a few minutes later, wouldn't they figure things out? Daniel Craig's accent seemed to come and go; I thought that would be a plot twist at the end...I liked the cinematography...",3.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
A Modern Classic Mystery,"May I just start this off by saying how grateful I am Rian Johnson found his footing outside of Star Wars.Now that I've gotten that off my chest, Knives Out feels like a love letter to the nearly forgotten Mystery genre enthusiast after what feels like years of neglect. This film is a call back to the gentleman detective that we have not had in some time. I mean no disrespect to the folks behind the Sherlock movies featuring Robert Downey Jr, or the BBC show, but Daniel Craig and Rian Johnson make this movie a true treat to enjoy. I own perhaps three physical movies I'd purchased in the last decade and am proud that this is one of them.I would be remiss to not speak of the acting in this film, because it is sublime. Both the characters and the performances of their actors fall seamlessly into place, pulling the audience into both the setting and the narrative. Having worked for a catering company previously, the way the rich family treated both each other and Marta was far from lost on me and really felt like the movie was playfully winking at me specifically. It all just felt so believable, which granted may be specific to me but I feel is more in general to anyone who has worked that type of job before. The grandfather who worked for his fortune treats Marta very well while his children treat her like 'one of the good ones' at best and a convenient servant at worst, and I promise you that is a direct mirror of real life.Getting back on track, Rian Johnson does a very good job of respecting the audience's intelligence while still having the final reveal be just the right amount of exposition to re-contextualize other events they hadn't given much thought to. I won't go into details in case someone is reading this review after coming from Glass Onion, but I will say that the finer points are different and feel a bit more intelligent here than it's sequel. I will say that Rian seems to be a fan of showing just enough for the big reveal to feel truly satisfying while still hiding enough from the viewer that the big reveal is necessary. It's entirely the reason I gave this a 9 as opposed to a 10; I can't quite put my finger on it but there is exactly one thing that bothers me about Rian Johnson mysteries and it's that he always hides one key piece from the audience such that you would never be able to guess what the twist is until it's revealed. To sum it up with a Benoit Blanc quote; ""It makes no damn sense! Compels me, though.""Overall, this is a near perfect movie that many will love and enjoy. Mystery enthusiasts may fawn over it, and everyone else with most likely still have a great first watch.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Quite Enjoyable and Satisfying,"Private Detective Benoit Blanc (Daniel Craig) is hired by someone (he doesn't know who hired him) to solve the murder of Harlan Thrombey (Christopher Plummer)who just had his 85th Birthday. Blanc must sift through lies, mis-truths, and outright deception to discover the truth. The whole family is assembled for the investigation by Blanc to determine who killed Harlan, but most are concerned how much they will get when the WILL is read.This is a loooong movie but it goes by so fast you don't really notice. And get this: when the Lawyer Frank Oz (Alan Stevens) reads the WILL, it is here a whole new story starts and you don' mind one bit because now it really gets interesting. You'll see.I got a kick out of Daniel Craig's Southern Accent. Finally we see some good acting by the one who plays Bond, James Bond, and he did great. I thoroughly enjoyed it.Twist? You want a twist? You got it. There are a couple and no you won't see them coming. No one did. You know how Harlan Thrombey dies, but Det Benoit Blanc needs to figure out all the steps involved, which reminded me of the old Charlie Chan (or Agatha Christi) movies back in the day, but here there is no number 1, or 2 son to rely on/ blame for not recognizing clues. Just a thought.The key to everything is Marta, Harlan's nurse, played by the most beautiful Ana de Armas. You will know what she knows, but there is much more to know that she doesn't know. You'll see. Oh, the one thing about Marta that you will come to know early: when she doesn't tell the truth, she vomits.Notables: Jamie Lee Curtis as Linda Drysdale, Thrombey's daughter; Don Johnson as Richard, husband of Linda; Michael Shannon as Walt Thronbey, son of Harlan, but who also runs Harlan's publishing company; Chris Evans as Richard's son Ranson who knows he was cut out of the WILL; Toni Collette as Joni daughter of Harlan; LaKeith Stanfeld as Lieutenant Elliott; K. Callan as Greatnana Wanetta, Harlan's mother; M. Emmet Walsh as Mr Proofec, Thrombey's head of Security.This is a very satisfying movie and when it does end, you will wish it didn't. You'll see.

Sex: No.
Nudity: No.
Humor: Yes, at times.

Nice character mystery,"I like that this is less about whodunnit and more about WHOdunnit.
It's a predictable movie, but it seems almost designed that way. There's a lot of little twists and turns the film takes like a letter having invisible ink proving an affair or a character trying hopelessly to destroy evidence. While these things may be predictable or even plot devicey, it oddly didnt bother me much. I think that's because the movie has such an infectious personality. It's shot super well, the music is wonderful, and the cast has so much charisma. But the crowning achievement is the characters and the snappy dialogue they are given. All the characters have distinct personalities and motivations. Watching the characters interact is easily the most entertaining part. I really watching this surface level family slowly turn on themselves revealing how horrible they really are. They are all nice, but not really. They are all self made, but not really. The only truly good person is our main character and it's satisfying to watch her traverse this families mine field. You may not like the slightly lofty approach it takes but it works way better here then in Star Wars.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

The film looks good but the plot and character motivations don't make much sense in the face of anything other than casual scrutiny.
That said I did enjoy the first act. If the rest of the film had continued in that tone it would have undoubtedly earned a higher score for me.

The coin toss.Daniel Craig's pretty darn good southern accent and strong performance. Christopher Plummer's exemplary performance. Jamie Lee-Curtis very good, near exemplary performance. Toni Collette's strong & wonderful performance. The complex plot and twists - need to stay focused. No short term attention span allowed here. K Callan's (Greatnana Wanetta) magnificent minimal but major role - breathtakingly and delightfully muted intensity.The 2 hour running time is well worth your commitment.

"Really Fun, But Deeply Flawed","My review header might sound a little pompous, but hear me out. We have a mystery who-done-it with a lot of twists and turns and an ""ensemble"" of characters. But the script, unfortunately, only focuses on 3 characters and actually doesn't give more screen time to the rest of the very colorful cast.Hear me out: instead of focusing on larger than life messages that this movie ham fists the viewers with, maybe it should have focused on developing the other characters so that the mystery element would work and viewers would actually be suspicious of the rest of the ensemble, instead of the main 3 that the film focuses on.It's a very, very weak mystery film, as there are some very obvious dead giveaways. On top of that it wastes majority of the colorful cast and only focuses on a handful of characters, which also serves to undermine the mystery element of the film as well. But otherwise, it's a really fun time, with some really good jokes, and if you ignore a few bad accents, the acting's great too.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

Honestly, it sounds like the cartoon rooster, Foghorn Leghorn, and it is endlessly distracting.(The next time you hear an Englishman complain about Dick Van Dyke's fake British accent in ""Mary Poppins"", remind him of Mr Craig's absurd effort to sound like an American in these two movies.)",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

great mystery if you fall for the convolution; way too talky and pontificating; solid performances nonetheless,"With the ""twist"" being revealed thirty minutes into this 2 hour movie, you know that can't be true. It's basic reasoning. So that said, the real twist or conclusion won't be exposed until the ending. I'm often terrible at guessing mysteries, but I correctly assumed the guilty party 45min in, as it seemed achingly obvious. Nonetheless, the film wasn't without its little surprises here and there. For the most part way too talky, there were scenes in which I silently begged Daniel Craig's character to shut up; which isn't to say he didn't do a great job, as he in fact was quite amazing. Performance wise. The overcomplicated vocabulary and diction, however, was tiring to hear for nearly two hours, although at least evidence that the acting was on par. Everyone involved excelled, even he or she who I correctly guessed to be guilty early on. My favorites were Don Johnson, Toni Collette, and Chris Evans. I suppose what it comes down to was the convoluted script, a major albeit transient plot hole (wish I could divulge, but alas, no spoilers here), and some very obvious clues that I'm guessing most people missed out on. I found the introduction of characters quite annoying, filmed via overlapping and slightly altered flashbacks that, in hindsight, had no effect on the outcome (or even progression) of the mystery itself. The sets, costuming, locations, and performances were all very laudable. I can't say that I'm a fan of Rian Johnson's work, with the sole exception of Looper (2012), which is easily one of my favorites of all time. So...it is what it is. That so many people enjoyed the movie as much as they did is no surprise.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

Knives out movies reviews,"Rian Johnson's ""Knives Out"" is one of the most entertaining mystery films in years. It's not just a wildly fun mystery to unravel, but a sarcastic bit of American social life in 2019. The story is about Harlan Thrombey, who was a wildly successful mystery writer, and he's dead. His corpse, with a slit throat and the knife in his hand, was found by his housekeeper, Fran. A couple of cops come to the Thrombey estate to do an investigation with Thrombey family members, including daughter Linda with a husband named Richard, son Walt, daughter-in-law Joni with Meg, grandchild, and Harlan's nurse and carer Marta. People, each of whom have dirty little secrets. The death of Harlan is believed to be a suicide. But the arrival of the famous detective Benoit Blanc changes the case. Blanc was delivered a news story about the suicide and an envelope of money. Not only is the detective unsure whether the death was a suicide, but he is also on the trail of the true killer, and all the suspects are gathered in the enormous house.Knives Out is an excellent murder mystery with a large ensemble cast. The way this film mirrors a classic murder mystery but is still unique is something to behold. It was amusing, intriguing, and enjoyable. Everything is set up and signaled throughout the movie to be the clue. The plot was well-developed, and the twist was fantastic, with the cause of death revealed early in the film. It will have you guessing who the culprit is. The plot thickens when the will is read, and the heir to Harlan's vast fortune is Marta. Each of the actors delivers their roles perfectly, and I love the dialogue in it. Daniel Craig is downright terrific as Benoit Blanc, a private detective with a bizarre accent and weird one-liners. This movie is a chance for Chris Evans to break out of the superhero mold he's found himself in. And Ana de Armas is great as Marta Cabrera, who is the liar and thief at the heart of this story. She really had outstanding performances. The tale seemed to drag at times, and the build-up to the final reveal should have been shortened. The conclusion was predictable, without a wonderful surprise. The ending was really awesome, with a perfect twist that I honestly didn't see coming.Knives Out is a great combination of a detective movie with a great plot twist and a comedy with great jokes, all mixed with a great cast. At the end, all will be revealed, and the journey from start to finish will have turned out to be worthwhile. This movie is worth watching.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

You're constantly thinking that the person who did it, will be caught (since you, as the viewer, knows exactly who did it, yet the characters don't), and that makes for a great story, eventhough you're misled and lied to at every turn.

The Butler Did It!,"Knives Out (2019) -While I enjoyed this film - It's got Chris Evans and Daniel Craig in it, how could I not? - It doesn't quite have the pace and the finesse of others of the same style.There are hints of Wes Anderson's 'The Grand Budapest Hotel' (2014) and obvious nods to Agatha Christie's 'Poirot' and even a bit of 'Midsomer Murders' (1997-) in some ways. It's a crime drama/thriller/comedy, it's easy to see such similarities, but yet it still does it well and in a slightly unique way.The cast all give performances that are enjoyable, even some of the lesser known or less recently observed names like Don Johnson give what is needed and they keep you guessing throughout as to who the killer is (Obviously). Even when you think that it must be 'Insert Name' there is still a doubt that you might be wrong or maybe that they had an accomplice. And isn't that what we watch films of this sort for - The test of our own detective skills? In that respect it does a good job and I'd happily watch it again in ten years time, when I might have forgotten who did what, but it's not such a great that I would want to watch it any sooner, regardless of knowing the outcome. I can easily watch repeats of Peter Ustinov's Poirot films - 'Evil Under The Sun' (1982) and 'Death On The Nile' (1978) knowing full well who the naughty murderers are, because the production values and performances are all noteworthy and perhaps there is an element of nostalgia to them that a new generation might find in this film, but for me it just seems to coast along a bit.There's nothing wrong with that of course. Sometimes that is all we need from a film, but I can't get super excited about viewing it for a second time, because it's missing something that Mr Ustinov's films had to make them more accessible and polished.I would be happy to see another film with Daniel Craig as the detective Benoit Blanc taking on his next challenge, in a similar way to the Poirot idea, but I would hope that another one would give me something more. A little extra that I didn't get here. Maybe Chris Evans naked would be a good start?699.91/1000.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

A well made Giallo that adds something new to the formula.,"""Knives Out"" is a movie that I have genuinely enjoyed. This is a major Giallo feature film, with a well written script that kept me entertained for a couple of hours. The movie has the perfect length, and by the end you have the solution of the case. The director exploited the well working narrative formula, used for decades, and mixed it with some modern storytelling and editing techniques: he added his personal touch. This is why it works so well in my opinion. There are certain plot twists that really surprised me, by changing the entire perspective of the story. It never takes itself too seriously and there are many funny jokes that actually made me laugh. I do not even remember when I felt like this while watching a big production released in recent years.Daniel Craig completely stole the scene, confirming once again his talent. I really like his interpretation of the detective Benoit Blanc with the almost comical British accent. His name is a clear reference to Poirot. I am actually very surprised by how many big actors were involved in this production: Ana De Armas, Jamie Lee Curtis, Michael Shannon and Chris Evans are just a few examples. Performances were absolutely astonishing, but with a cast like this one, I was not expecting otherwise.I wish that Hollywood would consider making more films like this one.

Cable Knit Sweaters are going to make a big comeback!,"Initially I avoided this film because the trailer just didn't do anything for me, and Daniel's Craig Deep South accent generally puts me off any film it appears in. But I was convinced by positive reviews from friends, yep I'm looking at you Dave!Wealthy patriarch of the Thrombey family - Harlan (Christopher Plummer) commits suicide and his dysfunctional and money hungry family come a calling. The police have to make sure the cause of death was suicide and then things get a bit back stabby and mystery based. Well, you actually find out what happened to Harlan about halfway through the film but the rest is the real mystery part.If Carlsberg did film casts, then this would be right up there. I could go on and on about how great this cast is and it is, Christopher Plummer, Jamie Lee Curtis, Michael Shannon, Don Johnson, Toni Collette and Riki Lindhome are as always superb, I mean that is a dream team of actors and actresses right there. But I wanted to focus on just a couple of members of the cast. First up, Captain America himself Chris Evans, after the Avengers, this is his first big film outside of the universe, it is nice to see him playing a more complex and less heroic character and much as I loved him as Cap, I'm looking forward to seeing him spread his acting wings now. Then you have Daniel Craig and his accent and you know what I was able to ignore it and focus on a great performance, he plays a detective who at first seems a bit out of place but soon develops into
Columbo/Quincy/Poirot and Miss Marple all in one package. His revel at the end is in the best detective tradition. We also have Ana de Armas as Marta, Harlan's nurse and the true star of this star-studded film. A Cuban actress who though appearing in quite a few films, this is the first time she's really taken centre stage. She's great in this role as someone trying to do what's right in a really mucked up situation whilst being played by everyone around her. And finally, Katherine Langford as one of the younger Thrombey's and Marta's friend who is torn between friendship and family, a real case of nature vs nurture - she and miss de Armas should both be stars of the future.I went into this film with quite low expectations and was very happily surprised, there are a few twists and turns and to be fair they're quite easy to spot a mile off. If you don't know who the baddie of this film is straight away then you need to watch more films! But is well-written with some fantastic ideas and an interesting path to get to the conclusion. It is sharp and witty and Chris Evans single handily has revived the chunky knit wear industry. The cast is stellar and Rian Johnson holds it all together with superbly, not a surprise as he wrote it as well. Each cast member on the poster deserves 1 point, Mr Johnson 2(1 for writing and 1 for directing) and because I was wrong, Mr Craig's accent can get a point and finally Dave earns the film another point by convincing me to give it ago. So, 15/20 for a film I had no interest in. Nice one murderous type peeps! I'm off to buy a White Cable Knit Sweater.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

Excellent Murder Mystery,"First off, I'll say that true murder mysteries are not my favorite genre. My parents love this type of thing. I typically get massively bored about 20-30 minutes into a ""inspector so and so whodunit."" This movie held my attention and was very well done.Lots of people on this board seem to be latching on to political or social statements. I didn't really see this as some sort of statement movie.What I did see was a fun, well spun, captivating movie that was also humorous. A number of scenes got chuckles out of the audience. No uproarious laughter, but keeping a mystery light can have positive elements.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
A good murder mystery for people that things go over their heads easily,"First of all, I know this is weird to start out with but the musical score, composed by Nathan Johnson, was amazing and helped bring people into that old school murder mystery feel. The music sounded like it came straight out of an old mystery movie. The acting in this film was well done by everybody but three people really stood out to me. The first-person being Chris Evans, who plays Ransom Drysdale. He's mainly known for playing Captain America and this role showed people another side to him that I really hope we get to see more of because he played this character to perfection and I just have to say this because Marvel geek but somebody needed to tell him to watch his language. The second person is Daniel Craig who has a weird accent in this movie that needs time getting used to but it doesn't take away from this marvelous performance. One thing that I love about mystery movies is the detective's process of figuring out the case and he delivered on just that. The last stand out is Ana de Armas, who plays Marta Cabrera. This movie could have easily lost me but she was one of the main reasons I kept interested in this movie because she brings so much to this role that it captivates you and want to try and help her out. Now, I will say this if you can easily pick up on things then this might not be the movie for you because after the big reveal happens you realize all of the clues that you should have picked up on and face palming, personal experience. In the end, Knives Out is a great movie for everybody and I do recommend seeing it. But, like I said if you can easily pick up on things, which I usually can but due to the annoying person next to me I couldn't, then you might not enjoy it as much.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

effective take on a familiar genre,"On the evening of his eighty-fifth birthday, wealthy tycoon and patriarch Harlan Thrombey celebrates (in a manner of speaking) with his combative family members, but is found dead the following morning. With the questionable circumstances surrounding his death only compounded by the issue of his final will, the game's afoot as crackerjack private detective Benoit Blanc is brought in to investigate, but upon meeting the patriarch's diligent eldest daughter, his smug grandson, his mooching daughter-in-law, and his dedicated nurse, it's difficult to discern who--if anyone--is guilty of foul play. Wisely never taking things too seriously, this is a vibrant, voluble take on the whodunit genre with a unique assortment of characters, clever twists and turns, and an ending that doesn't cheat the audience. Craig gives a colorful, finely tuned performance as the debonair southern shamus who may know more than meets the eye, de Armas is right on target as the vulnerable caretaker, while Evans has loads of fun in a role far afield from Steve Rogers. ***",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Sometimes-fun but uneven murder mystery,"This homage to Agatha Christie is Rian Johnson's first film since ""Star Wars: The Last Jedi"" (the only other one of his films I have seen, which I thought was alright but not great.) I love Agatha Christie as well as the cast of this film, and was looking forward to an entertaining and darkly hilarious homage to classic murder mysteries. While the film has some laughs and moments of sharp writing that make it a somewhat entertaining diversion, it unfortunately feels less than the sum of its parts.The initial setup is simple: a popular and acclaimed crime novelist is found dead, with a slit throat, right after celebrating his 85th birthday in his mansion. From there, anyone related to him could possibly be a suspect. The film's first act is really strong, with great production design of the Thrombley family mansion, a good score and clever use of musical cues, sufficient character development, and some snappy and well-paced writing. After that, though, things start to get rather uneven and anti-climactic. The acting is generally good, although none of the characters get much of a range. While there are pockets here and there of good dialogue, the film's numerous attempts at political and social satire feel very hollow and forced. There are a few recurring juvenile gags that get annoying after a while as well. Parts of the film are quite entertaining for sure, but overall I'm not certain how well it holds up in its entirety or whether it really lives up to the rave reviews it has received. 6/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

Classic murder-mystery,"Knives out is a typical murder-mystery movie. It is the first movie Rian Johnson made after Star Wars the Last Jedi, and that in itself is more puzzling than anything that you see in the movie.It is very classical in its approach: there is a murder; it is a mystery of who done it. The twist on the premise is that the murder is not actually a murder and we follow the investigation through the eyes of the perpetrator.I feel in a lot of ways similar emotion as when watching the Last Jedi. In theme, tone and subject these movies are obviously very different, but there is something distinctively Johnson-esque, to both of them. They are a re-telling in a Rian Johnson fashion of movies/tropes that we are familiar with (that lead to an end-result that is arguably underwhelming).For one thing all the ingredients are good or excellent. The actors are all great to the point where I regret not seeing more about them. The characters are somewhat stereotypical but that is expected from these types of movies. The set design is cool, it is a mix of quirky and gothic. There are callbacks to classical horror/thrillers, but it remains light and playful. The costumes are also very well made and are used to convey information efficiently. The cinematography is not anything groundbreaking, but I felt that there was an effort to emphasize the sets and the costumes and therefore the put forward the tone and the plot.The plot is Achilles Heel of the movie. Not that it is bad, but it is merely passable. For all the flair and ingenuity the movie displays it is rather bland. The plot has twists, it had turns. Some characters are charming, some characters are despicable. There not really any element that stands out.Also you don't really get anything form it. There is no moral, no metaphor. There is not really any kind of reflection on anything.
To be fair, there is a mention of politics in the film, and there might be some commentary on immigration or immigrants. But it is too subtle to be taken seriously. The political commentary the film has, is more evocative than definitive. It feels sneaky. It feels more like a way to ground the film or to do characterization rather than an honest take on the topic. There is one character that is alt-right, but it does not inform on his behavior or his motives. He is just alt-right.
There is no broader meaning to the film.In a way that was not what I was expecting from the movie, and it is not something the movie advertised. The feeling I have is that this movie, with everything that it is and that is does, could have been a quiet masterpiece. Instead it is rather prude, bland and frankly forgettable.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
A twisted twist,"The setting with many suspects and a detective in the middle of it, the great revelation in the end which is quite different from what seems to be the case, the beautiful set- nostalgic and perfect, reminded me of an Agatha Christie novel with a modern spin and witty dialogues.

Exptected more! 6/10,"Review:
Although the cast is pretty amazing, I did find this film to be a pretty average ""whodunnit"", which is a shame because it started off pretty well. Once the main character, Marta (Ana de Armas) reveals the true story behind the death of Harlan Thrombey (Christopher Plummer), I didn't really see the point of the film, and it seemed to go round and round in circles, which I found pretty annoying. It's obvious that there was more to the plot because of how early the ""suspense"" element goes straight out of the window, and I knew that Chris Evans (Ransom) would play a big part in the conspiracy because he is one of the biggest names in the cast. As for Daniel Craig (Benoit Blanc), he certainly wasn't in the same league as Sherlock Holmes or Poirot, especially with that weird Southern accent, but he produced a touch of genius towards the end, which saved the film. Like most Agatha Christie type movies, everyone is a suspect, and one of the fun and amusing aspects of this film is the interrogation of the suspects at the very beginning, but even that was short-lived. I did like the chemistry between Daniel Craig and Ana de Armas towards the end, and all of the family members in the house put in a great performance, which is why I was expecting more from the film. You do end up sticking with the plot because your expecting something amazing to happen, which it kind of does towards the end, but it's isn't memorable. It just seemed like an episode of Quincy with some fancy actors. Anyway, I personally think that it's only worth a one watch because once the plot is revealed, I cant see people rushing to see it again. Average!Round-Up:
This movie was directed by Rian Johnson, who also brought you Brick in 2005, The Brothers Bloom, Looper, 3 episodes of Breaking Bad and the Last Jedi. It's been announced that there will be a Knives Out 2, after the profit that this movie made, so with Daniel Craig not playing Bond anymore, I'm sure that he will step up to the plate to play Benoit Blanc once again. Although I found this film to be overrated, I still think that it's cleverly pieced together towards the end, but not that surprising. And what was it with the whole doughnut analogies? Anyway, I got the moral of the story, that good always outdoes the 7 sins, but I still thought it was slow and predictable in places.Budget: $40million

Biggest Disappointment of the Year,"This movie has arguably the worst writing I've ever experienced. I was incredibly excited to see it for months. I tried to stay away from excessively watching trailers or reviews to come in with as little of an expectation as I could. Which for me was hard. I adore the entire cast, I have thoroughly enjoyed some of Rian Johnson's earlier work (Star Wars excluded), and I got caught up in the nostalgia of a thrilling ""whodunnit"". Upon seeing it, I was very quickly shocked by the lack of originality, the completely cheesy dialogue, and a horrendous and obvious plot. I have never walked out of a theater in my life but this is the closest that I've ever come. I openly laughed at how bad the dialogue and plot points were.

Amazing!,"I saw the trailer and I was skeptical. Yet, this film far exceeded all my expectations and then some.With special homage to Clue & Murder on the Orient Express, Knives Out is a murder-mystery.

While it's common to assume who's responsible, we learn that every detail given is as important as the last. Audiences' suspicions will change continually throughout the film in an organic way.Though Rian Johnson created this masterpiece, more special appreciation to the absolute A+ cast in this film. In such a star-packed film, it's surprising that chaos no one actor claimed most of the screentime. Special shout-out to Daniel Craig's (fake but hilarious) southern drawl, Chris Evans' as the prodigal son, Jamie Lee Curtis as the tough-as-nails mogul, Jaeden Martell as the young alt-right jerk, and the rising stardom of Ana de Armas & Lakeith Stanfield and many more.

Should only work for people who haven't seen anything in the genre,"I want to start by saying that I live for crime mysteries so I am 100% in the target audience. I'm quite familiar with the genre and I love everything in it by default.However, this movie had too many flaws and I can't understand how it has such a high score. My only guess is that most of the people who voted are incredibly unfamiliar with the genre and don't have a reference point.Anyway, let's get to the chase. For a crime mystery it's incredibly important to get the audience to ask the right questions. There have to be very few very clear and interesting questions. And this is the most important thing the movie does not get right. The questions change all the time, they are too many, they are unclear, too simple, some too easy to figure out anyway. And we have this issue both in regards to the plot and to the characters. So the mystery part is done incredibly poorly.The crime part is almost OK but a lot of the time it's all over the place. We didn't get a proper view of the picture in regards to the crime that took place. What exactly was done and how, what the police see as being suspicious and why, dissection of the motives of the characters and, you know, and actual investigation. It would have been fine if it wasn't such a crucial part of the story and if at least the mystery or the drama was very good.So, next on the list is the drama. This is the only genre that actually has something to offer here. Trying to work with the characters' differences in moral stances and ethics was a very good idea, unfortunately this part of the script was in embryonic state. I believe that if they went with that as their main guiding line and main genre the movie could have been very good.Lastly, if you go in expecting comedy... I hope you will be able to see any. It is beyond me how this is even listed as a genre here. The movie is light and easy to digest but that's not really comedy.Other general notes:1. Casting was fine but I have no idea what they were even trying to do with the Daniel Craig character. In the beginning I needed quite some time just to get used to him and for the rest of the movie he was below average. I admit, I truly can't even guess their intentions there. Other than that I found the casting and acting to be enjoyable.2. I found the music to be just as messy as the story and the mix of genres. I am sympathetic because it must have been really difficult to figure out what the movie is supposed to be and therefore how to make the soundtrack.3. I would really like to say something good or that I would recommend it anyway to people who haven't seen anything of the genre at least, unfortunately I just can't do that. It felt undercooked and messy. I would not watch any sequels they decide to make. Any British crime movie or TV show is a hundred times better in all aspects so why waste my time.I hope this is not where detective movies are headed. First Kenneth Branagh and now this... There are plenty of people who know how to make these movies right, just give them a chance, Hollywood!",3.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

"Not bad dumb entertainment, but not a clever crime story","It's a fun enough movie to sit through for some casual entertainment, but don't go into the movie expecting a clever crime / mystery story. The ""culprit"" is revealed way too early, making me expect there was more to it, which it hardly was. The rest of the ""reveal"", isn't much and is obvious at the point it's being revealed. If you have ever read a good crime mystery novel, it will leave you disappointed.The acting overall is fine. But Daniel Craig's southern accent is terrible, he should have stuck to speaking British accent. It wouldn't have hurt the plot or movie. But I guess Ryan was subverting our expectations on that one.There are a bit too much underline throughout the movie as well.

A Fun but Forgettable Whodunit,"To put it mildly, director Rian Johnson's experience behind the camera last time around was a highly interesting and career defining one.Charged with taking over the new Star Wars saga in the form of the hotly debated The Last Jedi, Johnson found himself victim of countless online trolls, critics and universe obsessed fanboys, as his franchise turning feature found itself scrutinized like very few films do.With its issues, The Last Jedi was still a film with some great moments and interesting ideas and the man who gave us Brick and Looper has always been a fine filmmaker with runs on the board, so it's great to see the keen aficionado of mystery and whodunits deliver an enjoyable and fun romp without any pre-conceived constraints holding him back.Knives Out is the type of mystery film of old, filled with a rag-tag collection of characters and possible suspects as Johnson builds off the foundation of authors such as Agatha Christie and filmmakers like Alfred Hitchcock, to concoct an extremely well-written and acted film that is sure to insight much fandom moving forward.It's not a film of much lasting substance, despite some already looking to deep into its underlying political themes born out of the Trump era, but Johnson and his cast are just having an old-fashioned good time here as Daniel Craig's ""KFC"" southern detective Benoit Blanc and Ana de Armas's (Brazilian, Ecuadorian or other various countries of origin) nurse Marta Cabrera team up to uncover the mystery of author Harlan Thromby's untimely demise.With Craig on top form here and going the whole nine yards and de Armas continuing to prove to us all she could well be the ""next big thing"", Knives Out is a joy to watch whenever they get too command the screen and surrounded by one of 2019's best ensembles, that is highlighted by an against type Chris Evans going to the dark side with his loathsome Ransom Drysdale and Michael Shannon dialing it back as Thromby's son Walt, Knives Out is always watchable.It's a shame Johnson included one too many characters into his film though, as not all of the supports feel that needful to the story, particularly Jaeden Martell's teenage internet troll (regardless of what Johnson intended, this feels like a character getting a say at the Star Wars keyboard warriors) and Katherine Langford's granddaughter Meg, these type of characters feel like mere wallpaper in a film that shines best when focusing on its best components which remains throughout de Armas and the usually gruff Craig.The other slightly disappointing aspect to this murder mystery is the fact that its final pay-off doesn't exactly come off as much of a surprise and at over two hours, it would've been nice to have felt more rewarded with a genuinely mind-blowing reveal, but they're high expectations born from a film with a great premise and some lovingly staged ideas.Final Say -A fun statement from a director who seemingly had the world against him with his last film, Knives Out is a well-played whodunit and while the film doesn't quite stick the landing, there's much to enjoy leading up to it thanks to some great central turns and whip smart script work.3 1/2 doughnut holes out of 5",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

A modern twist on the classic cozy mystery of the Golden Age era.,"""Knives Out"" is a film that can be categorized as a classic whodunit murder mystery, in the vein of the popular novels of the infamous Golden Age of Detective Fiction era in the 1920s and 1930s, but there are plenty of twists regarding the genre's well-known and overused tropes that give a kind of postmodern character in the production. The movie features a stellar cast with Daniel Craig as the detective protagonist and Ana De Armas, Jamie Lee Curtis, Christopher Plummer, Michael Shannon and others in the supporting roles. The director. Rian Johnson ( Looper, Star Wars: Episode VIII ), creates a proper cozy mystery atmosphere while at the same time playing with the audience's expectations by twisting the already known rules and primary tropes of the genre's films.The premise of the story is reminiscent of an Agatha Christie novel: An elderly patriarch, Harlan Thrombey (C. Plummer), a renowned crime fiction author, is found dead in his room by his maid. His throat is slit and the police investigators initially dismiss the case as a suicide. The night before, Harlan held a party in his mansion where the members of his wider family were invited. In the first few minutes of the movie's runtime, we watch one by one of Harlan's children being interrogated by two police officers and a mysterious private investigator, Benoit Blanc (D. Craig). Blanc suspects foul play in Harlan's death and he immediately detects the lies he is told by all the witnesses/suspects who seem to hold each one a motive for wanting their father dead. Until now, we are witnessing the classic build-up of a whodunit murder mystery story where every character becomes a suspect in the eyes of the viewer. But after the first 25-30 minutes, the truth about what happened to Harlan is revealed to the audience. Thus, the director overturns the genre's usual timeline which dictates that the truth regarding the murder is divulged only in the finale of the film, constituting its climax.Nevertheless, the story doesn't lose its excitement and intrigue as we now watch as the guilty party is trying to sabotage Blanc's investigation by various means in order to shift any possible suspicion from him/her. I don't want to write anything more about the story as it would ruin a remarkable viewing experience. The film's plot is solid and unravels in an even tempo with each shot having its own importance and place on the overall puzzle. The acting by every member of the cast is impressive and especially Jamie Lee Curtis after a long time delivers a memorable as well as hilarious performance as Harlan's daughter, Linda. Craig is doing an equally splendid job in the role of the brilliant, mercurial private eye who shares some common characteristics with some of the genre's most beloved protagonists-detectives of the classical era.The element that makes ""Knives Out"" a worth-remembering picture is its great sense of humor which is expressed mainly by the quirky characters on-screen and the truly exceptional dialogue. I can't remember a single whodunit title from the past that featured such great interaction sequences between the characters. It should be mentioned that Rian Johnson is also the screenwriter of the film and he proves that his talent extends much further than directing. This is a movie for all, as I doubt that there will be many who will dislike ""Knives Out"" . It can be recommended to families too, as there is a total absence of gory images and/or profanity.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

Chekhov's Knives,"Even tho Rian Johnson really didn't do Star Wars any favor with ""The Last Jedi"" and I didn't wanna see any of his other films after it, I needed to give this a shot after hearing so much good stuff about it and knowing that he directed Breaking Bads best rated episode ""Ozymandias"".As a fan of crime related stuff and murder mysteries, from dark and grimmy like ""True Detective"" and ""Se7en"" to lighter and a bit more comedic like ""Sherlock"" and ""7 Psychopaths"", I wanted to see just how smart this will be and if I can figure out who it is before Rian tells me.So, even tho I knew who it was halfway through, I didn't know all the details and I certainly didn't expect it to be this intricate, I was surprised by all the revelations about what exactly happened despite knowing who it was. An achievemt I would say.Paying attention gets rewarded, every scene matters in this film, even the seemingly most insignifacnt ones are there for a reason, there were no loose ends by the end of it, which shows how well structered this film is.And it's incredibly satisfying seeing all the pieces put togetherSome people watch a lot of crime stuff and others don't, but I think Mr. Johnson did a great job balancing the two, without genre fans calling it predictable, knowing exactly what happened before it gets revealed and casual viewers getting confused just by the amount of characters alone.I loved it, this could be a ""Whodunnit"" classic.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
An entertaining Sherlock'ess with a GREAT story,"Perhaps I'm just old fashioned but, this movie has ALL of the components that make a detective mystery complete!Daniel Craig is probably one of the most adaptable actors around. He fits this part so well I firmly believe he could pull off the Pink Panther role in a heartbeat. And the rest of the cast are memorable and make this a great movie with plenty of 'twisty bits' that help to keep you wondering right up until the inevitable 'room full of suspects' scene.The cinematography is one of the greatest parts of this movie, the sets are somewhat limited (it's a manor house detective movie, what do you expect!), but if you have a tendency to admire the photographers artistry, you will with this. The panning and focus isn't something that I would normally notice, but in this it is carried out with utter perfection, which adds a depth of art that is frequently missed, or simply not present, in many of today's offerings.Synopsis: great set, great acting, great story and delivers the required caveats when and where required.

There's a nasty racist joke at the very beginning about Italians.I guess my biggest disappointment was the ending.

"Really great, entertaining and fun movie!","Knives Out is one of the most entertaining movies of this year. It is funny, witty and suspenseful. My favourite things about this movie is the cast, production design and obviously the story.The cast was superb, Ana de Armas was super good in the movie but my favourite has to be Daniel Craig, especially with that weird Southern Accent. I thought it was weird at first, then I was quite used to it. Chris Evans also pushed his boundaries this time with his character and he did really well.This movie is shot really well, the light and colours are amazing and there are a variety of shots they used.The Production Design is the best about this movie, especially the house. That's one of the most beautiful houses I've probably ever actually seen. It feels luxurious and rich but also feels very homy and cozy, It doesn't feel unrealistic at all.The score really adds to the movie as well, giving it kind of a classic vibe. Like a fun murder mystery you see on TV when you were young which makes the whole concept of the story feels nostalgic.The story is gotta be the best thing about this movie. Rian Johnson made a simple story and turned it into a complex and astonishing story with charismatic characters that are very well written. As the movie goes, the more the plot thickens and it builds up. It is really worth the watch just for the plot itself.The only thing that I didn't like about this movie was some characters. You know they're there just for the laughs or as someone that you don't really know them and they come in just to kinda help with the plot. But other than that, everything is fine.Overall, this movie is really worth the watch. With great a great story, cast, cinemotagraphy and score.

A MURDER MYSTERY MASTERPIECE,"I loved this AWESOME ensemble cast, murder mystery thriller, the talent is mega here with a huge cast of fantastic actors such as Jamie Lee Curtis (Halloween franchise,The Fog) & Daniel Craig (James Bond) & Chris Evans (Captain America) & Ana De Armas (Knock Knock) & Michael Shannon (Man of Steel) & Don Johnson (Machete) & Toni Collette (Hereditary) & to top the rest ensemble off with Lakeith Stanfield, Katherine Langford, Jaeden Martell & Movie Legend Christopher Plummer!!!! A hell of a great cast.The exciting, interesting & super smart story is about a renowned crime novelist Harlin Thrombey (an excellent Christopher Plummer) is found dead at his huge mansion estate just after his 85th birthday & a Brilliant & debonair private Detective Benoit Blanc (a Brilliant Daniel Craig) is mysteriously enlisted to investigate. From the crazy & dysfunctional family & his devoted staff, Blanc has to sift through a huge web of red herrings & self-serving lies to uncover the truth behind Harlan's death. Each actor brings so much richness & detail to their character, it's a beautiful piece of filmmaking in my opinion with a truly stunning setting with the massive mansion setting that is just beautiful, old looking & richly detailed & a place you would want to explore, the look of this movie is gorgeous too with a lovely cozy look & set during the Autumn & simply lovely cinematography. The real knockout performance here is from the beautiful Ana De Armas, this lady is truly a phenomenal actor who really carries to the whole movie & interacts with everyone of the huge ensemble cast of characters & holds it all together perfectly, her performance is fantastic as she struggles to help others & keep secrets & its a great performance. I was also really impressed by Chris Evans as he's moved onto such a different role than what we know him as (Captain America) & it's a fun part from a guy who is only really known for his Marvel movies work, he's a great actor here. This is also the best I've seen Daniel Craig in a film, he's excellent here as the smart Colombo type Detective with a deep southern accent, another great performance. Jamie Lee Curtis is another legend of Cinema & as usual she's great here & alot of fun, always been a Jamie lee Curtis fan since i grew up watching the Halloween films & The Fog. The whole cast is terrific fun & the movie is a huge piece of entertaining fun & with a real cozy atmosphere.

The good people are of course illegals, but the film spoils its own message that people given everything are ruined with hypocrisy, it is after all an ideology built on inherent contradiction.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Kinda good but Johnson lost his thoughts,"Good one-timer movie with great potential, ruined by poor, usual and boring tools for revelations..Its good family comedy/drama crime story.. Some things and ideas were clich√© , some were good and funny.
Certainly its not movie which you will return to every 2 3 4 months like ocean eleven or predator, but it has quality..
Im not the one who trashes Johnson for Last Jedi but i dont think he is some kind of genius either.. Knives Out is very good one-timer with incredible cast and with the most beautiful living thing on the Earth (Ana de Armas).
My problem with this movie is the cheesy , predictable and very usual choice of ending and picking the tools to create final revelation.
The hidden flashbacks are key and its sad (or stupid ?) to decide NOT to show them to audience because you as the viewer cant play along and decifer who is the killer or the bad guy..
The most and second (but the biggest) problem is second half of the story. It derails from solving the murder case and focuses on social drama regarding with money and greed..
I mean i was very saddened how Johnson decided to finish this movie bc it derailed from detective crime comedy/drama to very mediocre and usual stuff with good guy (de Armas) and bad guy (..?..)
Lastly , i blame Johnson to create very stupid and unnecessary political message by trying to say very liberal-ish ""Trump bad, illegal immigrants Good, common sense BAD , socialism Good ) . I mean, almost every movie by those very soft directors MUST annoy the half of audience and losing the touch with reality.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

Entertaining Whodunit,"I enjoyed this film from start to finish. It has enough twists and turns to make Agatha Christie proud. A family patriarch worth millions - ironically, from his outrageously successful mystery novels - dies in his huge country mansion following his eighty-fifth birthday party. Although it appears to be suicide, a world-famous detective who arrives on the scene isn't so sure.There are certainly plenty of suspects - his voraciously greedy family members have been sponging off him for years, and live in constant fear of being cut out of his will. Added to the mix is his young, sweet-natured nurse, who is the one person in the household he genuinely likes.What went down that night is revealed before the movie is halfway through - but is it the whole story? The detective (played with a Southern accent of indeterminate origin by Daniel Craig) and the nurse team up to unravel the old gentleman's death. But can either one of them trust the other?A sterling cast is in fine form - Jamie Lee Curtis as the victim's daughter swanning about the huge house, the incomparable Toni Colette as his widowed daughter-in-law and self-help guru, Don Johnson as the blustering son-in-law, Chris Evans playing against type as the smarmy grandson, and numerous others. Cast standouts are Craig and Ana de Armas, who shines in the part of Marta, the pretty nurse.There are humorous moments, but don't expect big laughs. Try to count the number of different South American nationalities ascribed to immigrant nurse Marta by this phony bunch as they keep insisting she's ""one of the family""....I'm not sure if they ever got the right one. There are a few pointed references to the social and political culture we live in as well.A very well-done movie, with the most natural-sounding dialogue I've heard in modern films - nearly all the characters talk like ""real"" people, with a singular lack of artifice. And I appreciated the fact that the gorgeous gothic mansion in its parklike setting is in itself one of the film's most outstanding characters. Its interiors must be seen to be believed.All in all,a highly enjoyable experience; I recommend it.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Funny form the start but takes a while to get interesting.,"But I guess that's how the structure of a murder mystery goes. The closer you get to solving the crime the more your investment pans out.
It's starts off being humorous from the moment the movie begins, and the laugh out loud moments never end.
Sometimes it seemed like a waste of a great ensemble cast because a lot of people were not doing much but then you realize sometimes it's the little things that get the biggest laughs, it makes sense that the players are all-stars.

Little nitpicks but overall enjoyable!,"If I have one criticism to lob at the movie, it's that halfway through it changes from a passive viewing experience to an active one. What I mean is it transitions from a movie where you are watching the story unfold with the detective, trying to figure out who did the murder, to a movie where you are expected to root for the characters and their lives/outcomes. That's not to say this is necessarily a bad choice, it's a creative take on the traditional ""whodunit"" method, but it does create a bit of tonal dissonance, and I don't feel like the main character was established well enough to make it work all the way.That said, that's really my only criticism, and everything else is done incredibly well. The shot composition is gorgeous. The dialogue is witty and funny. The movie is quirky and fully embraces the absurdity of itself. The social commentary doesn't get overbearing. The acting's also fun. It doesn't expect you to take the cheesy, cringey bits seriously, which I highly appreciated. Some performances were over the top, but it's very clear you're laughing WITH the movie, not at it.The best part of this movie, I think, is (surprisingly) the amount of rewatch value it brings, which is uncommon for a ""who dun it"" story where you already know the ending. The comedy is very well-done and well-integrated into the story. There are a lot of subtle gags that are easy to miss in the first viewing, like when a shot suddenly cuts to a shaky cam following the main character around that seems incredibly out of place at first, but it actually turns out it was the kid livestreaming on Instagram a second later. Stuff like that is really subtle, shows the creative team put in the effort, and actually makes me want to pay to see the movie again.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
One of the most ridiculously entertaining murder mysteries to grace cinema screens in a long time,"Knives Out is a whodunit mystery film written and directed by Rian Johnson (Looper, The Brothers Bloom). Starring Christopher Plummer, Daniel Craig, Chris Evans, Jamie Lee Curtis, and Ana de Armas, it is one of the most ridiculously entertaining murder mysteries to grace cinema screens in a long time.One day after celebrating his 85th birthday with his dysfunctional family at his large mansion, renowned crime novelist Harlan Thrombey (Christopher Plummer) is found dead in his study room. The police are soon called to the scene to investigate the causes of Harlan's death and to determine if foul play was a factor in all of this. Joining them is the famous private detective Benoit Blanc (Daniel Craig), who has his own unconventional methods of figuring out the situation, much to the chagrin of the other Thrombey family members.With its slick production values and witty dialogue, Knives Out injects so much quirky energy into what is widely considered to be an archaic genre and successfully modernises it as a result. Writer/Director Rian Johnson, who clearly has an affinity for this type of movie, takes a great amount of influence from the work of Agatha Christie, with the singular setting and oddball characters rounding off what would normally considered a surface level murder mystery. In addition to this, Johnson detracts from the usual European vibe of the genre to give the film a considerably more American feel, reminding his audience that the genre is universal and not necessarily restricted to a particular continent or culture.There is so much beautiful visual flair in this film. Each scene felt articulately laid out with such clever use of colour and symmetry. One part of the film's set involves an expensive looking seat with a plethora of knives surrounding it in a circular pattern, which can catch the viewer off guard during some important scenes. This again feels like a callback to the whodunits of decades ago, which implemented the surroundings into the story, making the audience question whether or not certain things played a role in the murder itself.Every character was used brilliantly throughout the story, with each one serving a purpose no matter how minor it seemed. All of the family members have a reason to be involved in Harlan's death and deducing who has the strongest involvement kept the film moving along at a brisk pace. However, to single out too many characters would give away the ending so I will only single out one: Daniel Craig. Craig is clearly having a wonderful time playing Benoit Blanc, who can only be described as a southern US Hercule Poirot. At first, Blanc seems like a total goofball with a funny accent but the further the story advanced, the more it felt like he was a figure the audience could trust at solving this mystery.In conclusion, while whodunits may seem dead to some, thanks to the efforts of Rian Johnson, there is proof that there is still so much enjoyment to be had. Even veteran viewers of the genre may be surprised at some of the twists the film throws at them. I urge modern audiences to give it a chance, whether you care for these types of films at all. You never know how much you may end up liking it in the end.I rate it a solid 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Entertaining,"A fun movie. I suspect writer/director Rian Johnson of attempting to sneak in a political message, but if so it is completely drowned out by the noise of merrily preposterous whodunnitry.Daniel Craig is a very good actor, so he gets away with being miscast as a Deep-South detective. Everybody else is effortlessly perfect, but it's really Ana de Armas' movie. She's excellent as the nurse to an uber-successful author (Christopher Plummer) whose family assembles for a get-together which was never going to turn out well. Ms de Armas' endearing rabbit-in-the-headlights quality belies a brilliantly controlled performance.Lots of delights elsewhere. Great to see Jamie Lee Curtis, Michael Shannon, Toni Collette and Don Johnson enjoying themselves so much. Interesting to see Chris Evans out of his Captain America uniform. K Callan has very few lines but reliably steals every scene she's in. And there's Frank Oz, delightfully deadpan, plus a cameo from the mighty M Emmet Walsh.It's designed, filmed and edited with enthusiasm. Nothing to dislike, really.

Knives Out (2019),"Directed by Rian Johnson. Starring Daniel Craig, Ana de Armas, Jamie Lee Curtis, Michael Shannon, Don Johnson, Toni Collette, Chris Evans, Christopher Plummer, Lakeith Stanfield, Katherine Langford, Noah Segan, Edi Patterson, Riki Lindhome, K Callan, Frank Oz. (PG-13)When the rich patriarch (Plummer) of a family of avaricious eccentrics dies (by suicide, it appears), private detective Craig--replete with a thick Southern drawl (""CSI: KFC,"" per Evans)--is on the case, trying to figure out what really happened and why. Entertaining mystery with a heavy dose of humor and social commentary keeps the twists coming at a fairly consistent clip throughout, modernizing the classic Agatha Christie-style potboiler without sacrificing the elegance and idiosyncrasies (wealth aside, this is not a family one would like to be a part of). Some of the surprises can be guessed pretty easily, others may prove challenging, but it's great fun no matter how good a sleuth the viewer is. Well-cast, with Craig, Collette, Curtis and de Armas being the standouts; because of the size of the ensemble, it's not always easy to keep everyone sorted out in relation to where they all fit on the family tree and beyond, but like solving a mystery, it all becomes clear by the end. Despite saying only a handful of words throughout the entire movie, Callan steals most of her scenes by virtue of vacant gaze alone.83/100",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
One Of The Best Murder Mysteries Ever!,"Knives Out is about the dad of the family committing suicide or what they say. Someone hires a detective to investigate the the murder when there is a bunch of fishy things going on.Knives Out is one of the best films of the year. I knew it was going to be good, but not this good. They did something I haven't seen in a murder mystery before. I won't say because it will get into spoiler territory. I just thought it was really cool and surprised me. The acting was something you had to mention. Chris Evans had the best performance in my mind. He was funny and also really serious when he needed to be. You haven't really seen him play a character like this since Scott Pilgrim Vs. The World. Daniel Craig was pretty solid. It did take me a little while to get used to Daniel Craig's weird accent, but I did. I wouldn't really say it made his character any better. I thought he could have been talking normal and the movie would have been the same. Ana De Armas was pretty good in this film too. She was the main character easily. I think a thing nobody is really talking about is how well the cinematography was. They had some pretty impressive zooms. Like I talked a little bit about earlier was how well the story was. The only thing I didn't like was in the middle act it started to drag a little. It is a really hard thing to make the middle act interesting and keep the same pace as the start of the movie. I really praise a movie when they do that. This movie didn't do it was well as others. Now the third and final act was a masterpiece. I really have to say, it was riveting and intense while also pretty darn interesting. It explained everything for the whole movie. The start of the movie was pretty solid too. It didn't really start as I thought it would, but it still started out with a bang.Overall, Knives Out was a great film that definitely reunited the murder mystery genre after the film Murder Mystery and the remake of Murder On The Orient Express. I would definitely recommend it.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

"Sorry Rian Johnson, but you are no Agatha Christie.","I was genuinely poised ready to love this film. A mystery movie with great reviews and a stellar cast? Definitely my thing. And... I liked it. I didn't hate it, but I didn't love it either. I liked the cinematography, the characters and the acting a lot, even if Daniel Craig's accent got on my nerves a bit. It was really an enjoyable watch. But if I'm being honest the movie frustrated me, in that for the majority of the film it seemed to be solved in the first half hour. Of course, I knew straight away that what was being presented wasn't actually what happened, but it took a while for me to feel like everything was all heading in a direction and that's what was frustrating. As for complexity in the mystery, I had solved it a half hour before the ""big"" reveal. I also figured out the minor twists before they happened, like with the knife and the ink, because there were some pretty displaced clues and comments. Which in great mysteries, these clues would have been hidden well enough that you miss them the first time so that the twists and reveals are shocking, and the clues become apparent as you understand what happened or when you see the film a second time. But they were pretty obvious straight away in this film, that I predicted everything before they happened. So although this was a good mystery, it did not reach great. I like what they were trying to do, but they definitely thought it was cleverer than it actually was. Hence, sorry Rian Johnson, but you are no Agatha Christie.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

Harmless Fun,"Knives Out is a who done it mystery thriller directed by Rian Johnson. The same director who did The Last Jedi, and has garnered an infamous reputation because of that film as well as his reaction to fan backlash. However, this movie is much more in Johnson's wheelhouse than Star Wars. He excels in more grounded thrillers, which is what this film is. Rian Johnson is a competent director if given the proper material.This is the first mystery thriller of its kind to come out in theatres since Murder on the Orient Express I believe. I liked that film better, but Knives Out, while not great, is a fun time with a stellar cast. You have amazing actors like Daniel Craig, Chris Evans, Jamie Lee Curtis, and Michael Shannon. Daniel Craig and Chris Evans steal the movie for me, mainly because I love those two as actors. If I had to pick Daniel Craig is the stand out performance here. Yes, his southern accent is over the top, but I think was intentional. Ana de Armas does good in the movie as well. I like her in Blade Runner 2049, and I like her here too.The film is very well shot especially inside the family mansion, which looks fantastic and gives off a great sense of style and atmosphere. Being inside this house gives you the feeling you're watching a period movie, even though it takes place in modern day. Unfortunately, the outside shots don't invoke the same kind of atmosphere.This film, for a who done it story, takes a very interesting turn. It starts out as your typical who done it mystery. But then it gives you significant info early on to make you think you who the culprit is throughout the entire second act, only to spin it around again at the end. It really plays on your expectations. Though, if you were expecting a more straightforward mystery story this might not be for you.The film does get a bit slow in the middle. I'm not saying those scenes didn't need to be there, but I'm just saying the second act is slower isn't as interesting as the first and third acts. Plus a couple of the characters feel pretty stock and disposable.Overall, Knives Out is a fun mystery flick. It's not a masterpiece, but it's style, cast, and character interactions make it a fun time at the movies.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

While Chris Evans (Ransom Drysdale) brings charm and personality to the character and Ana de Armas (Marta Cabrera) stole the show, Daniel Craig's (Benoit Blanc) southern accent was painful.

"Believe the hype: truly phenomenal, brilliant, & funny","This film's reputation precedes it, and at last I see why: Rian Johnson is brilliant, and 'Knives out' is exceptional. It's a murder mystery - with twists of both comedy and noir - filled with sharp, smart, snappy dialogue, and varied and complex characters with wildly different beliefs, values, and motivations. The cast is extraordinary, both for simple name recognition and in the performances they give. From start to finish the acting is characterized by vibrant, electrifying energy, to say nothing of fantastic range, nuance, and poise. Daniel Craig is an absolute joy as Benoit Blanc, adopting an affect that cheekily defies our most familiar conception of him as an actor, while Ana de Armas gives a commanding, sympathetic portrayal of Marta that in my mind marks her as someone deserving of much more to come. And every one of their co-stars is just as excellent in bringing their characters to life. I had high expectations when I sat to watch, and still they've been blown away: 'Knives out' is phenomenal, an instant classic and must-see.There is no element of the production that isn't perfect, and a paragraph could be filled simply listing all the nuts and bolts of which a film is comprised. Apart from the cast, however, it's filmmaker Johnson who must be especially singled out, and lauded, for such a truly magnificent creation. His direction is impeccable, and every scene is rife with rich detail and orchestrated with such vivid, clear, natural precision as to immediately resonate. Above all, though, his writing is utterly terrific. The narrative takes inspiration from noir, mystery, and thriller stories of many years past, with familiar ideas serving as anchors - a genius detective, a dysfunctional family, a big reveal - but whips every last iota into a wonderful, new, wholly original form. From the unassuming opening, through every charged, biting, and sometimes rancorous turn, to the concise and witty ending, 'Knives out' dazzles with a story that's wide with possibility even as we think we already have a complete image. I don't know how much highly deserved praise I can lavish on the plot without betraying foreknowledge, or exhausting a thesaurus, but it is deeply absorbing, and superbly entertaining, never missing a beat.I can't imagine I have much to say that many others haven't already, but it feels important to emphasize once more: for all the great acclaim to greet this movie upon its release, it has earned every last bit of it. There is no exaggeration to be found in any remarks on its utmost quality; this is an instance in which the hype is no jest. The performances are exquisite, every technical aspect and rounding detail is stupendous, and the writing is flawless. It's not enough to say 'Knives out' is a ""really good"" movie - it's an outstanding movie, among the very best to have been made in recent years. It pays respectful homage to murder mysteries and crime flicks of long ago while building something all its own, and in the process joining that rightly revered company. It's exciting, captivating, funny, thrilling, rewarding, and indeed fulfilling. Simply put, 'Knives out' is one of the most tremendous viewing experiences I've had, and a mere ""recommendation"" hardly seems enough - this is essential.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
A very fun homage to mystery novel adaptations,"Because of the way he responds to criticism, I am not a fan of Rian Johnson, but you have to render unto Caesar the things that are Caesar's: this movie was well written, well acted and filled with love and attention to details. It feels like an homage to Hercule Poirot films, even having one character watch an Angela Lansbury episode of Murder She Wrote at one time. You get the house of rich a-holes who all have a reason, the victim dying in strange circumstances, the innocent character that the viewers can identify with - if anyone can truly identify with Ana de Armas... - and, of course, the weird private detective with a strange accent. Perfection!But then still, you get more love. A cast of celebrity actors for even the smaller roles, a story that has all the elements in the clear, inviting the viewer to solve the mystery themselves and a clear feeling of people enjoying their work. I have to say, with sadness in my heart, that being used with movies having the twist at the end based on ad-hoc information than the viewer wasn't even privy to, I didn't even try to figure the mystery out. I invite you to do so, because once you try, it's pretty satisfying.The movie is a bit too long and for people not feeling nostalgic about the mystery series they were watching when they were children it might feel a bit dry.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
A light whodunit for Thanksgiving.,"""This is a twisted web, and we are not finished untangling it, not yet."" Benoit Blanc (Daniel CraigIt's tough to mix crime and humor, but writer/director Rian Johnson does it well with Knives Out. A spoof of Agatha-Christie-like murder mysteries involving family, Knives is sharp with off-handed humor, especially through the sleuth detective, Benoit Blanc, who has a dry delivery almost as irritating as his ersatz Southern accent.The investigation afoot is the suicide of the patriarch, Harlan Twombly (Christopher Plummer), which Blanc suspects is a murder. The many relatives, all to benefit from a favorable will, are suspects. The house, of course, is gothic Victorian seen more than once from above in the now-common drone shots.The humor comes in turning upside down our usual expectations for a whodunit. A suspect immediately arises, and the resolution comes with innocence in the forefront. Neither of those circumstances conform to the usual tropes, but added humor comes from the expert acting of those who deliver irony deftly and subtly and the contemporary references such as Baby Driver and Juuling to make it modern.When Joni Thrombey (Toni Collette) exclaims about Benoit, ""I read a tweet about a New Yorker article about you,"" current culture is updating the old mystery formula. And it's all in good humor.
At times the dialogue flies between characters as if Robert Altman were running the show. Overlapping swift repartee can leave some of us behind, especially as we like to savor each word. Yet, the speed gives an energy to an otherwise not remarkably ingenious plot.The contradictions to the mystery formula are often surprising and fun. After a full day of Thanksgiving, including the often-thrilling mysterious dinner, Knives is a welcome joy and reflection, happily neglecting to murder smart-aleck patriarchs like me.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

Enjoying The Sharp Humor To This Mystery,"Mystery movies can certainly be fun, but the refined art of mapping out a crime can be a challenge in this world with ever shrinking attention spans. However, there are still writers and directors out there ready to give it a try in hopes of bringing thought out plots back into the popular trend. Tonight's review holds such a promise and even more so it holds another redeeming trial for a director whose involvement in Star Wars was not the best received. With lots of advertising, I'm sure you have seen the trailers so let's get going as I review:LIKES:Acting
The Cinematography
The Plot Is A Good Mystery
Better Twists Than Anticipated
Involvement With Most Of The Cast
The ComedyDISLIKES:
Some rather worthless characters
The Run Time
The Pace
Perhaps A Little More MurderThe VERDICT:With an assembled cast such as this, you can best bet the acting will be at least moderate, and for me it was a fantastic display of work. All parties assembled really play the dysfunctional role well, portraying the motive filled shouts and complaints to an art that did not annoy or go overboard. Too many names to place I'll say that Craig was entertaining in his role of Colonel Saunders (a running joke) meeting James Bond as the detective, primarily in his interactions with Marta. Ana de Armas was the star for me not only because of her character, but more so in the way she played the levels of emotion perfectly and interacted with the squad the most to balance this art. Past the acting, the movie really picks up in terms of the visual presentation, feeling much like a detective movie from the 50s-80s, but modernizing it to the present day. It should captivate many mystery lovers, but more so generic fans who can point out a lot of devices and nods to famous detective sagas. However, the movie's main selling point is the presentation of the story that let's face it has been told time and time again in a Hallmark like fashion. Johnson, for me, accomplished the role of bringing out a good mystery, not only in the classic hunt for clues and mapping out suspects, but adding some nice twists to the mix. If you are paying attention to time and some info, you'll start getting an idea, but this film's twists (no matter how convoluted) do manage to spruce up the dusty manor of detective works. An even better angle for me, is the character utilization, while not perfect, every character has a purpose in some form or angle, with few sitting off to the sides as just mere bodies to fill a convenient hole or bridge. If not for the sake of the plot, then the character was used for comedy and that may be my favorite part of this movie. Knives Out manages to be very humorous in the regards of the comedy aspect, with well written dialogue, delivery of those lines, and timing wrapping up nicely to leave many laughing during my showing. That I feel will be a pull for many audience members, though don't expect usual slapstick, banter, and ridiculous, logic defying stunts to be pulled here, or you'll be disappointed.For such an artistic film though, there are still a few things I would have liked tightened up. Though all characters were utilized in some form, I can't lie at least three could have had more involvement than what they did. Hinting at being a part of the plot, these characters were left to the passing comments or joke props until that one moment a clue contributed. That family engagement they sold in the trailers, needed some more development for me to keep everyone entangled in the mess as opposed to on the side. In addition, the plot could have used a little more murder and threats to help spice up the drama/mystery, as I am partial to the deadly games of hunting in my movies, than anything else. For a movie selling that murder, I had kind of expected something else, but it's a mere trinket. I can say the thing I had the hardest time with was the run time and the pace. Knowing it's a Johnson movie, I expect it to be long, and for the most part the movie ran at a good enough pace that it did not feel super long, but other times did show the dragging I dreaded. I can say that there were parts that could have been cut out to shorten the length, or at least rewritten to include the character interaction I mentioned above.So in conclusion, what are the thoughts on this controversial movie/tale. To be honest, I do think it is a reimagining of Clue, and took a step into the modern world to help reach out to the new audiences. It's got the presentation of a mystery, with twists to help bring our well-acted characters together and entertain us with their drama. Comedy is also pulled out of the sheath and I think these two elements are the biggest selling factors to brave the nearly 2.5 hour run time Johnson has put forth. As such, I feel this movie is worth a shot at hitting the theaters for those looking for a drama/mystery/comedy, while others will most likely enjoy from the comfort of their homes.My scores for Knives Out are:Comedy/Crime/Drama: 9.0
Movie Overall: 8.0",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
"Mostly entertaining ""whodunnit"" in the vein of Agatha Christie.","My wife and I watched this at home on DVD from our local library. We enjoyed it but I have a hard time sharing all the high praise for this movie. It is one where near the end lots and lots of exposition is required to explain what all happened and how the inspector figured things out. To me that is a flaw in the script and directing.The most curious character is Daniel Craig playing a deep south (think thick Georgia accent) detective Benoit Blanc. He is called in by the family after their very wealthy partiarc is found dead, seemingly of suicide. But there's a lot going on in this eccentric extended family and when the will is read all hell breaks loose.The movie is mostly entertaining but the first part, where the detective and local police interview each person, moves a bit slowly.

Subverts expectations in the best way possible,"Now, I'm not a fan of the Last Jedi but that's no reason to dislike Rian Johnson as a director. I think he is best suited to doing things that aren't part of a franchise but let him unleash his creativity, as he has proven previously with Looper and now with Knives Out. This movie was beautifully shot, very well acted, the script was great and on top of that it is also genuinely funny. All the actors are great in their roles and everyone gets to have at least one moment in which they can shine as their respective character. I was very surprised that I could not see where the movie was going to go at all. It truly does a murder mystery movie completely differently and I am glad that the trailers did not reveal any major plot pointsl. Compared to a movie called the Good Liar that I saw recently, which was also a movie with plenty of twists Knives Out is at least a league above it. Whilst the Good Liar's surprises felt weak and preposterous, the twists in Knives Out are great and constantly keep you guessing. I was totally engrossed throughout and I was not bored even for a minute of its running time and fully recommend it.

Magnifique.,"The murder mystery isn't really a genre that has seen much exposure in Hollywood over recent years, studios more intent on setting up more profitable cinematic universes. Step up Rian Johnson with Knives Out, a classic whodunnit that brings us cinema's next great dysfunctional family.When Harlan Thrombey (Christopher Plummer), a wealthy novelist, is found dead in his study, private eye Benoit Blanc (Daniel Craig) is brought in to investigate his death, leading to clashes with the eccentric members of Harlan's combative family.With Knives Out, Rian Johnson has woven a tapestry of delightful twists and turns to keep the audience on their toes and guessing right until the end, littered with memorable dialogue and enough family feuding to last a lifetime ensuring the path to the truth is an extremely entertaining one. It's also one of the funniest films of the year, Johnson lacing the film with intricacies that can be easy to miss but play a major part in siding against such a despicable family. The attention to detail from Johnson in his narrative is nothing short of stunning.The Thrombey family would be nothing without such a high calibre ensemble bringing each and everyone of them to life with such verve and class. Daniel Craig is the star of the show with an exquisite performance as the eccentric private eye Blanc, Craig having a ball with the southern drawl and nailing the comedic beats to a tee. Ana de Armas gives her best performance to date as Marta, Harlan's nurse, the innocence and vulnerability shining through her incredibly emotive features.There isn't one member of the ensemble who feels out of place, the likes of Jamie Lee Curtis and Toni Collette bringing the sweetness as well as the viciousness when required. Chris Evans looks to be having an absolute blast playing a Tony Stark type character after playing the boy scout for so long in the MCU, his line deliveries having me in stitches at times. The great thing about Knives Out is that I have my favourites from an initial viewing however, the characters are all so good that my favourites could change every time I revisit it.Knives Out is one of the best cinematic experiences I've had all year, Rian Johnson serving up a real treat of a whodunnit for audiences around the world. If there's one character I'd love to see more of, it'd be Daniel Craig's Benoit Blanc.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

I must admit that on first hearing Daniel Craig's southern accent I found it a little odd, but on watching him in the rest of the film, he was just brilliant and played a great part. For us he was no longer Craig but the P.I. At times, early on, his character reminded me of inspector Clouseau, when the the clues were right under his nose and he was completely missing them. Very funny.I didn't know what to expect and as the story unfolded we wondered where it was going and who did what. It is so well acted, with the great cast bringing all the characters to life. It was comical how the family 'loved' Marta, the nurse, and thought of her as 'one of the family', yet each one gave a different country of her origin! Proving that actually, they didn't - as long she looked after Dad/Grandpa, they couldn't care less about her.I loved the way that Craig's private detective put all the clues together, just as Christie did in her books.

"An engaging, tense, fun murder mystery!","I wasn't sure what to expect when I walked into the Icon Cinema movie theater in Albuquerque earlier tonight to see knives out. Knives out is... astonishingly good. I have seen my share of murder mysteries, and this thing is ridiculously fun. Between a well-crafted murder mystery, a great cast and wonderful performances by them all but ESPECIALLY Daniel Craig, Chris Evans, Christopher Plummer and Jamie Lee Curtis.There's a lot of mysteries set up in this movie and strangely enough, the tail end of the murder part of this mystery is actually revealed near the end of the first act. But from there there's still a lot for this film to reveal, like who did what, why did this happen?(I know I'm being vague, trying to avoid spoilers).As of my writing this review, I can see that 591 people have given this movie a 1 out of 10. My guess is that those 591 people have in fact NOT seen this movie and are little more than pathetic trolls trying to downvote this movie because of their comically overblown intense hatred for The Last Jedi and Rian Johnson.This is sad, because Knives out is a genuinely great film. Some elements reminded me of Agatha Christie's ""Appointment with Death"". Anyway I guess what's most important is that I had a great time.

Humorous and clever whodunnit,"Knives Out was a delightful experience from beginning to end. At first I assumed it would stick to the general conventions of the whodunnit, as the movie started with Agatha Christie style suspect interviews. But from there it diverted slowly into its own modern twists. As the stakes got higher and events kept getting stranger, I became both excited and apprehensive for the story's direction. Could the ending really tie up all these loose threads? How will Marta or Blanc resolve any of this?Several times I thought I had the answer. And then I realized I hadn't. This movie was really good at that: keeping me in the guessing game until the very end. It had this push and pull with the pacing so that I always felt like I was just one step away from solving the mystery myself, only to get to the final reveal and get blown away. It was just so satisfying.And the performances were great too. As humorous as Knives Out was, there were also some politically charged scenes. These things can get a bit awkward depending on the performance, but I felt it was handled with great wit and care. It helped that all the characters were written very well. While the Thrombey family were all entitled rich pricks, they each had their own special shade of entitlement that I found very amusing.There is nothing bad I can say about this movie.

Johnson's script craftily jumps on the bandwagon of the racial sensibility by pitting Marta against the whole bunch of white rich bigots, among which, Jamie Lee Curtis as Linda, Harlan's firstborn, vehemently goes berserk with both barrels in her hypocritical outburst, but we should also feel sorry for her, as a business mogul, she is saddled with a cheating husband (Johnson) and a deadbeat son Ransom (Evans); Michael Shannon's Walter Thrombey, Harlan's youngest son, goes with a different approach, tentatively dragooning Marta with veiled menace. But, as empty vase makes the most noice, up till then, most audience would be confident that they're all red herrings (Toni Collette is toothsome in her shameless freeloader mannerism as Joni, the widow of Harlan's deceased son).""read my full review on my blog: cinema omnivore, thanks",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

While set in modern times, the film has a really timeless feel to it, similar to the stories by Agatha Christie. While the formula is familiar; rich dysfunctional family living in a big mansion, all with secrets to hide, the twists and turns are quite surprising.
The entire experience is engrossing, and, while the story did not quite go where I initially expected, the ending was great, and actually smart. The whole thing was also really funny at times, adding to the whole entertainment value of murder mysteries.
Daniel Craig, playing detective Benoit Blanc, really goes to town on his role, with a southern 'accent' I never really heard before. Ana de Armas really shines in this movie as well, and the ensemble of great actors playing the eccentric family members all made their screen time memorable.

"All is not forgiven, but it's a good start.","After giving us the godawful Star Wars movie The Last Jedi, I was ready to get my knives out for anything directed by Rian Johnson, but I was pleasantly surprised by this engrossing, star-studded whodunit. While its twists aren't always unpredictable, the film is still a whole lot of Agatha Christie-style fun, as private detective Benoit Blanc (Daniel Craig) tries to unravel the mystery behind the death of wealthy novelist Harlan Thrombey, with numerous suspects among his family and staff.Is Harlan's Guatamalan caregiver Marta (Ana de Armas) responsible for her boss's death as she believes, or is someone else guilty? As the plot unfolds, one becomes convinced that Marta is simply a pawn, but quite who is making all the moves remains unclear until the very end, when all the pieces are finally put together by Blanc. It's an enjoyable ride, and there's more fun to be had after the film has finished in trying to remember all the plot twists and see if they check out. I'm satisfied that they do.With such a great cast (Jamie Lee Curtis, Toni Colette, Don Johnson, Chris Evans, Michael Shannon), the performances are solid, and everyone looks like they're having a whale of a time with the old-style murder/mystery shenanigans. If you push all thoughts of The Last Jedi out of your mind (a big ask, I grant you), there's a good chance you'll have a good time too.7.5/10, rounded up to 8 for IMDb.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
A Good Old-Fashioned Whodunnit,"This was such a fun whodunnit that was pretty hilarious and well acted. Chris Evans and Ana De Armas bring such powerhouse performances in this film. The dialogue is witty and well written, there are twists and turns that I did not see coming. I think Rian Johnson is not as clever as he thinks he is, the script is solid and pretty tight, but in the end it's nothing different from what we've already seen before. I suppose that's my biggest issue, I'm not sure I'd say it's a different take on the whodunnit genre like some others have said, because in the end it's just the same old trick. The message and the commentary in this film was pretty obvious, ham fisted, and heavy handed. There are some other elements to the story that were stupid, but other than that it was a thoroughly enjoyable film with an amazing cast, great acting, a solid script, and pretty good directing.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

I miss movies like this.,"This movie does not involve capes or ""IP."" It is not a sequel. It is not adapted from a novel. It is not an art house flick or Oscar bait. Which begs the question...how did it get made? All I know is Rian Johnson just proved it is still possible to write and direct a great genre film that is self aware but still takes its story and its characters seriously (and even manages to make some points without trying too hard). The cast is great. The homages to classic murder mysteries are fantastic. The humor is both hilarious and subtle. The twists are just right. I hope EVERYONE goes to see it because EVERYONE can enjoy it. Here's hoping more filmmakers (and studios) are willing to tell these kinds of stories. In an era where most blockbusters feel derivative, sometimes originality is just telling familiar stories really damn well and making them feel new again.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
The kind of thing Rian Johnson should be directing,"A funny, witty, and clever just like the movie Clue. As far as Who Dunnit? movies go, it's pretty solid and deserves some credit for it's take on dark comedy and characters. A lot of people are gonna say it's a Clue ripoff, but you can blame the trailer for that. There are similarities, the house is a character unto itself, and it's filled with a bunch of wacky weirdos trying to solve a murder, but that's as far as it goes. It has great production design, a fantastic cast and a very funny script. I love a good dark comedy, like Clue, Death to Smoochy, or anything from the Coen Brothers. Daniel Craig has one of the best parts in the movie, but everyone steals the show in their own way. It's the kind of movie Rian Johnson should be directing, something original, quirky and fun to watch. A lot of old people in the theater, which was funny, because we all know they like Murder, She Wrote. You could almost guess what might be going on, but it still manages to be it's own thing. It's a fun watch, and it's good to see something like this still being made.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

"While Entertaining, Overhyped and Underwhelming","While the movie is entertaining, it places political themes over plot quality. While this isn't a negative in film per se, the plot is integrally important to whodunnits, which this purports to be. As a fan of mysteries and thrillers with twists, I found the resolution obvious before the halfway point, leaving me pretty disappointed.This is another entry in a string of recent political movies posing as a film of any given genre. Jordan Peele's ""Get Out"" and ""Us"" did it beautifully, Boots Riley's ""Sorry to Bother You"" did it shockingly badly, and Rian Johnson's ""Knives Out"" falls somewhere in the middle.

A fun diversion from the frantic holiday prep!,"My husband hadn't heard of this movie (outside what I told him) but knew I wanted to see it and surprised me with Early Release tickets. We went last night and it was just a fun time at the movies and a happy diversion from all the holiday prep we've been doing. Don't regret going at all (like you do with some movies).Knives Out recalls the days of the black and white PI movies and the television shows of the 70s and 80s, while bringing the genre firmly into the modern age.It felt formulaic at times. That said, there were enough surprises to make you laugh, think, or even cringe and that keeps it from being too predictable! We were delightfully surprised that we couldn't figure it out completely. As one reviewer said, the tie-up wasn't quite a surprise (the Who) but the rest (how it all comes together) had some elements we were surprised about.It walks the line between brilliant new Whodunit and tongue-in-cheek throwback parody. There are enough references to previous renowned PIs (without shoving them in your face) to make it feel almost a parody. Especially with quips like, ""CSI KFC"". Yet, they have created a unique Whodunit in wonderful style that mostly keeps you interested.There were points (especially in the middle/middle-end) where I felt it dragged a bit, but it picked up again quickly and we were drawn back into the story almost as soon as I realized I was getting restless.I personally think the actors were the best part of the whole thing. I realize they are actors and this is their job, but it seemed like they were having a ball with their typecast/stereotyped characters. Most notably, Daniel Craig and Chris Evans. It was pure joy watching them enjoying their roles so much. You could feel their fun coming off the screen. It didn't hurt that these are roles we don't relate to these gentlemen often so it was such delicious fun to watch. (Seriously, good-guy Captain America to spoiled Trust Fund Playboy? He had so much fun with it.)Overall, it probably won't end up in my top 10 favorite movies. At the same time, if it's on, I'd probably watch it again and again.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

Great and Entertaining,Knives Out is entertaining and quite a win. It has a stellar cast and uses them well. The story and mystery has echoes of Agatha Christie in this decent whodunit.

It was also easy to understand and follow the series of events. Not unnecessarily complicated. The film did feel a tad bit long.

A Sharp Send-up to the Whodunnit Done Well,"GRADE: BTHIS FILM IS RECOMMENDED.IN BRIEF: An highly entertaining murder mystery that harks back to an early time and succeeds as a delightful tribute to the classic whodunnit genre.JIM'S REVIEW: Knives Out is a nifty little murder mystery that pays homage to the once popular whodunnit genre. Rian Johnson assembles a fine cast of actors and writes his carefully plotted screenplay to masterful effect. Any armchair detective or moviegoer should enjoy this intriguing diversion.Mr. Johnson sets up his mystery in an elegant old mansion, the home of Harlan Thrombey (Christopher Plummer), a successful mystery writer who sets the plot in motion on his 85th birthday celebration by agitating family members with secrets and scandals afoot. His demise seems like a foregone conclusion with many of his children and their offsprings all having enough anger and motives to do the old fellow in.The main suspects and possible heirs to the family fortune include: Linda Drysdale (Jamie Lee Curtis), Harlan's eldest daughter, and her husband, Richard (Don Johnson), Harlan's youngest son, Walt (Michael Shannon), who is in charge of his father's publishing house, and Joni (Toni Collette), Harlan's free-spirited daughter-in-law. Also brought into the fray are Harlan's spoiled grandson with the unfortunate nickname, Ransom (Chris Evans), Meg (Katherine Langford) and Jacob (Jaeden Martell), two more of Harlan's grandchildren, and Marta (Ana de Armas), his loyal and loving nurse who cannot tell a lie. Along with the local police team investigating the case, Detective Lieutenant Elliot (Lakeith Stanfield) and Trooper Wagner (Noah Segan), is super sleuth and private detective, Benoit Blanc (Daniel Craig). The cast is uniformly strong, and watching them inhabit their roles is a particular pleasure, with Mr.Plummer, Ms. de Armas, and a wonderful Mr. Craig as stand-outs.Knives Out keeps one guessing as all good mystery should do and while it stays within the Thrombey home, the story remains true to its roots. But, in the third act, the film unwisely opens up its atmospheric setting and loses some of its cherished momentum with an unexciting car chase sequence, some unnecessary plot twists, and a slightly disappointing ending.Still, Mr. Johnson's solidly uses style and ingenuity in his overall construction of his whodunnit and directs with flair. This is especially true when he incorporates his visual images to reveal the true goings-on of the events in question which directly contradicts the suspect's alibis. The audience seems to get the upper hand before the team of detectives start their deductions, making the story more complex and entertaining.Knives Out is a clever nostalgic send-up of the old murder mystery whodunnit done well. This Clue-like stage has been set for an old-fashioned murder and the mystery formula remains intact. Yes, this modern update is a welcome reimagining of the classic whodunnit and has enough charm and intelligence that would make Dame Agatha proud. Sleuth on!",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
"A fun, modernized whodunnit","Rian Johnson has crafted an enjoyable new spin on the murder mystery genre. With a stacked cast led by Daniel Craig and Chris Evans having loads of fun in their roles, Knives Out is very much set in today's world and updated accordingly. I liked that the story was a complex web, but not one impossible to follow if you pay attention to the various little clues throughout the movie. Even if you can guess what will happen, there are still some extra twists that can throw you for a loop.

Knives Out Cuts Deep,"Knives Out isn't a Who Dunnit. It's a How Dunnit. It's a disassembled, deconstructed murder mystery that makes a mockery of the entire genre. Whatever you think is going to happen here, doesn't. That's fascinating. Rian Johnson is a really talented guy. I feared that this film was going to suffer cliches and lulls throughout, but not for a second was I not invested. I loved the convoluted nature of the mystery. The cast themselves help bring it all together. The standout is Daniel Craig in the most gloriously fun role he's ever delivered. It's hammy, it's over-the-top, but that's the point. He plays an old-school southern detective with an unorthodox knack for cracking completely absurd murder mysteries. He puts Sherlock Holmes to shame. The rest of the cast fires on all cylinders. This is the rare instance of an ensemble cast in which everyone compliments each other beautifully. I believe we'd go from a really good film to a great one with a trim of unnecessary dialogue. A few key pages of this scrip hint at a larger political message that doesn't materialize into anything meaningful, nor was it necessary. Some characters are seen, but seldom used, like Lakeith Stanfield as the lieutenant detective. But overall, this movie is nothing but fun.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

Overhyped and Plodding Pace,"This was a letdown. It's at an 8.1 on this site now and I can't imagine how it got there.So many critics raved about this, one saying something like, ""So hilarious and smart it made my brain hurt."" Whoever that was is easily overwhelmed. It dragged in the beginning, it took a long time to go anywhere.The pacing was very slow on and off. The acting was generally mediocre. Christopher Plummer as Harlan Thrombey, a mystery author, was very good. Daniel Craig as Benoit Blanc, a private investigator, had an awful forced accent that never, ever ended. He was trying to channel Frank Underwood and missed. It should have been a great ensemble movie, sadly it was not. It fell flat.I love classic mysteries. An important part of a whodunnit is pacing. The actual killer wasn't a surprise, the full details of the manner of death were more boring than thrilling. This movie never got to classic mystery status. I don't think the movie knew if it wanted to be classic like Agatha Christie or quirky like Casino Royale.If I can think of anything good it is particular parts of the house and some statues that are related to Harlan Thrombey's mysteries. A piece of furniture and action scene at the end was very well done.I could have skipped this movie, but was drawn in by clever editing in the trailer and some over the top reviews that do not match what I saw.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

to quote David Spade i liked this movie better when it was called Clue.,"Seriously just watch or re-watch Clue(1985)and youll get everything that you need from this ""film"". While corny murder mysteries have NEVER been inside my wheelhouse apparently lots of people like them so if you are one of them you will most likely enjoy this rehash of things weve all seen before. I personally have always found such tropes tired and cliche but apparently people love seeing things that they have already seen before just repackaged as something new and the slow thinkers out there will really love trying to piece together the ""mystery"" as it gives them some sort of simple reward if they think they can figure it out ahead of time before the big reveal.

Clever and Original...enough,"KNIVES OUT was one of the films I had circled on my calendar as a ""must see"". It seemed to be a perfect antidote to the CGI-Fest films that are very prevalent in the multi-plex today. So...when life got in the way and I couldn't get to this film for about a month, I tried (and succeeded) in not getting this movie spoiled for me in my various Social Media feeds.And I'm glad I went to such lengths, for I found KNIVES OUT to be a truly original and entertaining film that kept me guessing throughout the length of the film - right up to the ""big reveal.""So...if you haven't seen this film...stop reading this now...go see it...and come back.Still here (or are you back)? Okay...let's continue...Directed by Rian Johnson (known by many as the Director of THE LAST JEDI, but I think this movie owes more of it's heritage to his breakthrough film BRICK or his Sci-Fi action flick, LOOPER), KNIVES OUT is an old-fashioned, Agatha Christie-type murder mystery complete with an oddball Detective trying to figure out ""whodunnit"" that features an All-Star cast of suspects as well as an Oscar winning murder victim.As I stated above, Johnson has traversed a murder mystery-type film before in his neo-noir homage BRICK, but in this film he really let's his wings fly as he plays, marvelously, with the drawing room murder mystery pastiche. Johnson wrote and directed this film and the twists and turns and originality of his vision is apparent on screen, playing with expectations without being too clever.He has assembled an All-Star cast of actors playing interesting characters. Jamie Lee Curtis, Michael Shannon, Chris Evans, Toni Colette, Don Johnson and Jacob Trombley all bring star power and charisma to their roles and each one COULD have been the murderer. As often happens in these types of films, each one gets A scene to shine, but only the one ""whodunnit"" really gets to step out.As the Law Enforcement on their trail, Lakeith Stanfield (GET OUT) and Noah Segan (LOOPER) play off each other well and they play off of Daniel Craig (James Bond, of course) very well. Craig plays Private Detective Benoit Blanc with some sort of Cajun-type accent that works more than it doesn't, I enjoyed his performance enough to find it charming and not annoying.Special notice needs to be made of the performances of Christopher Plummer - as the murder victim (I'm not spoiling anything here, it's in the trailer) and Frank Oz (the famous Muppeteer and Director). Both are ""old pros"" who bring a grounding to the proceedings. Their performances are almost down to earth commentaries on the other characters/performances and they both helped out this film tremendously.Finally, the film revolves around the journey that Ana de Armas' character, Maria Cabrera, is on in this film. She is the audience's eyes and ears into this story, having clues and plot points revealed to her as we, the audience, have them revealed to us. I fell in love with de Armas when she played Joi in BLADE RUNNER: 2049 and she is pleasant enough company here to search out this mystery with.With all these pieces - and characters - to put together and move around, I did find that this film suffered a bit by ""too much"" and ""too fast"" at times that caused me not to care about certain people and circumstances (especially at the beginning), but that was quickly forgotten/forgiven as the film progressed and I was engrossed in the mystery - a mystery that I did not know how it was going to end.And that, is unique and rare enough for me.Letter Grade: B+7 1/2 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

vibrant panache and punctilious.,"Knives out is the kind of whodunnit film & very fashionable movie that will never fail to entertain. It's grand ensemble of familiar faces. Everything was beautifully done in this movie, the story, the flow & the scenario.The film filled with surprises with turns.

10 stars,"'The film follows a family gathering gone awry, after the family patriarch's death leads a master detective to investigate.' Entertaining, amusing and fast paced. An excellent plot with a fantastic cast. Daniel Craig is on top form here as detective Benoit Blanc and the plot keeps the audience guessing with its constant twists and turns.Putting a modern spin on the classic 'whodunnit' Agatha Christie type plot is nothing new, but Knives Out manages to pull it off with incredible ease. Craig's performance nicely caught the balance between David Suchet's Hercule Poirot and Peter Falk's Lieutenant Colombo. Top marks all round, very pleasant watching.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
It's decent,"Few filmmakers try so hard as Rian Johnson which is the main reason most of his movies fall apart by act 3, at some point the highwire act just sef-defeats. This is true of Knives Out as well, but the film works a little better than his others because it commits to its shallow house of cards act. It is all a series of artificial sleight of hand movements with Johnson's direction going as theatrical as he can to sell them and actors doubling down in the caricature. The political stuff would be embarassing well meaning Hollywood liberal material, but feels as much a put on as everything else, if this had been made after Looper as I assume was his original intention he would grab whatever commentary on class talking points would fit mid second term Obama and little about the movie would've change. In the end, everything here from the Gravity's Rainbow joke to every time Craig repeats Armas has a good heart to the film not resisting to remark on Craig's accent serve the same function to keep the artificial closed-off mystery machinery going. Good on Johnson to take his Disney clout and put it on making the ideal Rian Johnson movie, his model train runs smoothly, I will likely watch 20-30 minutes of it whenever it is on at late night cable and think ""Knives Out is nice"". I just wish the ideal Rian Johnson movie had more to it than just its own effectiveness.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
"Dear Lord, this movie is obnoxious","I usually hate movies that treat viewers like morons, and this movie is pretty insulting in that aspect.The ""quirky"" detective played by Daniel Craig was the worst part of it, I swear this movie would have been one million times better if he had died. Preferably in a rather undignified, anti-climatic manner.I honestly think people was so happy for finally having the chance of seeing a Hollywood film that wasn't a remake, sequel, reboot, or part of a franchise that they
didn't mind very much the film in question being total garbage.This movie won't survive the test of time, and it will become one of those movies that were beloved at their time, but completely forgotten shortly after.",2.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
a completely enjoyable movie,"Knives Out is a completely enjoyable movie. That's it! I recommend watching it if it seems like something you might be into (well-acted mystery movies with well known stars). Why it feels like a slight to not bestow this film with an avalanche of additional praise, I'm not sure. There's an odd cult around Rian Johnson that feels manufactured. He's a really good filmmaker, both technically-speaking and at putting together a compelling story with his screenplays. He's no genius, however. This film is a super fun romp, but it's not nearly as clever as it thinks it is. Its twists aren't that twisty. Its Scooby Doo ending is highly Scooby Doo ish. I'm glad this film made a lot of money and has a lot of fans, because it is really good. That's it. That's the review.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
I was really impressed with this mystery!!,"A really fun watch! It looks boring at first, but watch it carefully, it will definitely shock you as it did us!Great murder mystery",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Tailor-made for the lovers of whodunnit mysteries! [+77%],"Well, well, well... we have an engaging murder mystery movie featuring a spectacular ensemble (led by Daniel Craig & Christopher Plummer) in our hands. The character played by Ana de Armas (who I remember from Knock! Knock!, War Dogs & BR 2049) is what drives the film forward to captivating twists and turns. A movie like Knives Out is best savoured by not having read the one-line-plot or seen the trailer.The first act, in my opinion, is what particularly stands out. Private detective Benoit Blanc (Daniel Craig) is investigating the supposed murder of wealthy crime novelist Harlan Thrombey. Writer-director Rian Johnson carefully toys around the audience with a few leads, a few red herrings, and even a few shots that reveal more than what they're supposed to (a second watch will prove this right). Yet, it's Rian's eye for detailing that mostly works in the case of Knives Out. Craig is fantastic (as always) and his appearances out of the blue in certain scenes were a treat to watch.While Knives Out is a modern whodunnit, it really evokes the feels of reading an Agatha Christie mystery novel. As each page turns, you know you're one step closer to finding out who was behind the ghastly crime (or you don't, until the very last page). The mansion and its surroundings provided the right amount of intrigue for a storyline such as this. The score by Nathan Johnson also added an extra layer of obscurity to the proceedings. Steve Yedlin, a frequent Rian Johnson collaborator, captures the wintry vibes of Massachusetts perfectly.Knives Out is probably one of my favorite films of 2019 owing to two reasons: a) I totally dig murder mysteries b) Knives Out is astonishingly well-written and made. You may not be completely blown away by the climax twist, but the way the film builds up to it is impressive. Ana de Armas is going to have a lot of good-to-great directors approaching her shortly.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
"Mildly irritating, but good whodunnit.","Great story. Good acting. Keeps you guessing until the end. Irritating southern accent attempt from Daniel Craig. He's a great actor, but from a southerner linguist point of view, he should stick to his British accent. Also began to get a little political with immigration policies becoming an issue in the movie. I'm not a fan of Hollywood pushing political agendas on either side. All this being said, we really enjoyed the movie and happily recommend it.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Outstanding,"Not really a fan of Rian Johnson after his Star Wars abomination but I have to tip my hat to him here. This film has it all; fantastic casting, acting, directing and writing.

What a wonderfully surprising movie!,"I just watched this movie on Prime. I did not go into it with much in the way of expectations but I judged it worth a look going on its rating here. I am so glad that I did.The movie is something of a slow burn. The pacing of the first act seems slow, but then builds up in the second act. The third act is awesome and represents a huge payoff for those who stick with it.It is an incredibly clever movie which by the end of it will amaze you with its attention to detail.Anna de Armas puts in a delightful performance of Marta. What a gem!I am somewhat torn by Daniel Craig's performance of Benoit Blanc. I think the accent that he affects is too distracting. I am not sure exactly why. Maybe it is just not Daniel Craig-esque or maybe it is not maintained at a consistent level.Chris Evans plays what appears to be a bit part. He is hardly sighted in the first two acts and I was a bit disappointed as I want to see how he does in a role post Captain America. However, that is just a ploy and he comes into his own in the third act. It was a wonderful performance that almost stole the show from Anna.So why not 10 stars? I have asked myself that question a number of times. I struggle to give an answer. It just did not feel like a 10 star movie. Maybe 9.5 but we only have whole numbers to work with. I think the reason is the pacing of the movie in the first two acts, although I am wondering if in fact I am being unfair as I think the slower pacing at the start leads to a bigger payoff in the end. You be the judge...",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Overrated,"For the most part, this is a pretty good movie, but it doesn't really get going until the second half. However, once again, Rian Johnson cannot keep his politics out of the script. (And this is coming from someone who for the most part will defend ""The Last Jedi."" (minus Admiral purple hair Holdo)) So much of it is focused on debates about immigration, and other politics. Why couldn't this have just been a mystery movie? When it satirizes the mystery stuff, it's done well, but, again, the political commentary is eye-rolling and distracting. I will say, Chris Evans was robbed of an Oscar nomination. His performance is by far the best one here, and this is a pretty star-studded cast! (It's kind of funny to hear him cursing, and at one point saying the F word, because of how many times he told people to watch their language in Avengers: Age of Ultron. That's some dang irony!) Daniel Craig's Southern accent is hilariously bad, and even the film points that out. I don't know if that was intentional, or if they just put Craig in this for name recognition. Either way, it was kind of weird. The political stuff is most likely why this nearly has a perfect score on Rotten Tomatoes and why it was nominated for Best Adapted Screenplay, even though the film itself is just kind of average.

"Entertaining movie, full of great actors, but unclear resolution, with multiple plot holes","I really enjoyed this movie in terms of pace, acting, cinematography, and the classic crime ""who's the murderer"" movie, mixed with some dark comedy and the casting is a very interesting one, but after finishing I was thinking something doesn't add up.I went back, watched the whole explanation/resolution and still didn't add up. Gave it more thought, read comments, plot hole forums about this movie, and I really didn't see an explanation to some big plot holes I don't want to discuss here as I don't like giving spoilers on reviews.The movie/ crime works anyway, but it's quite a big thing that's brought to the story and acts as a big clue to solve the crime that doesn't make sense. Maybe it's just me, as I didn't see many people commenting the same thoughts, but it definitely affects my rating and final thoughts on the movie.I know, you may think I didn't understand the movie, but I really put a lot of thought and read about the topic, and there's definitely a big plot hole, look online for it if you don't mind spoilers.The movie as a whole is good and entertaining though, so this issue doesn't make it a bad movie at all from my point of view.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

"Slick, witty, fast paced and hilarious",I didn't know much about the film before going in bar it was a whodunit with Daniel Craig and a dodgey Southern accent. But wow!

"Very impressed, one of my new favorite movies","I loved mystery book and movies, specifically Agatha Christie's. Loved (past tense)...because a few years ago I lost interest in any kinds of books and whodunnit mystery movies. I don't even know why? I guess it's depression, I dunno. I tried to bring back my interest by watching or reading whodunnits, but I just could never finish them. So I gave up and thought maybe things just change or whatever. Anyway, all I want to say is that Knives Out brought my love to the mystery genre back. Suddenly I'm obsessed with Agatha Christie books again, and I'm currently planning to read the Poirot ones in order again. Also planning to watch a lot of mystery. And I can't wait for Knives Out 2.Anyway Knives Out is such a gem of a movie. The story is brilliant, I love the cast and acting, and everything about it is just perfect, for me anyway.

Johnson Subverting Expectations Again!!,"I just got out of Knives Out, it was a packed screening at 11am on a Wednesday.Once again Rhian Johnson pulls the old bait and switch, I went to see one movie, but got another!! Oh how this guy loves subverting expectations!!It's hard to say if I liked it or not, as I was disappointed to not get the all star, murder mystery ensemble I had been promised in the trailers, but I did enjoy what I got though, and I laughed a few times. I'd say it's a thriller more than a murder mystery. Oh and it has a political message too!! They are not subtle undertones, they hit you over the head with it.All of the big stars have don't have that much screen time, Daniel Craig probably has the most, whilst Jamie Lee Curtis has the least, Ana de Armas gets the most screen time, and she is hardly in the trailers.The cast are all having fun in their roles and its hard not to enjoy yourself when they are in screen, but I'd have to say Ana De Armas is the best one here.I can't get into what I didn't like too much without going into spoilers etc, but all in all I enjoyed it for what it was, instead of hating it for what it wasn't.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
And the person whodunnit is.......??????,"Above average film whereby I enjoyed the fact that a film like this gets released in the first place. So your settling down in trepidation of what's to come and to work out all the computations of whodunnit, but unfortunately I was so disappointed as it could have been so much better. Sorry Daniel Craig fans but that accent was terrible. If that accent was so important to the character then I'm sure there are loads of actors out there that could have done a better job than Craig. The rest of cast were OK but nothing special. I've seen better whodunnits with just as good but less known actors with better plots on TV. It wasn't a waste of money that some reviews suggest. Was the plot obvious? well it wasn't to me but the so called ""twist"" wasn't anything special or a ""took my breath away in amazement moment "" I'm still glad I went to see it as it was entertaining for me and I go to the movies to be entertained.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

Lovely performances by the entire cast. But it's so cool that in a place like Hollywood, such a stellar cast can come together to play roles while a newcomer takes the lead role. Doesn't happen in India.

The overused greedy White people at a will reading trope is given a 2019 woke makeover, as they try to screw over the South American employee.As most other poorly starred reviews have said, it's not a patch on what it thinks it is, it's also too long and it has an unpleasant undertone of 2020 style rasicm.Frankly, it's embarrassing, Rian Johnson strikes again, he should be unemployed.",2.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
