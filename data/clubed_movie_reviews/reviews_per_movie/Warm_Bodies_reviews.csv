More original than you might think,"Finally the great zombie romance? Well, maybe not, but it's the closest I've seen. You get to see zombie life from the perspective of a zombie, who starts to get feelings for a girl who's alive. Through a set of circumstances, he ""rescues"" her and they take refuge in a grounded plane at an airport overrun by the undead. There were several original elements that I had never seen in a zombie movie. First and foremost is the narration by our young zombie giving us insights into his condition. He can barely utter words, but weirdly, in his head, he seems smart and talks normally. I liked that part and I was kinda sorry when he got somewhat better at talking, therefore evacuating most of his thoughts. Second original element was the romance. I wasn't impressed by it, but at least it was slow-building, somewhat charming, avoiding most of the disgusting stuff, and you kind of rooted for them by the end.Third original element would be the zombies not stuck as they are. They can ""evolve"" (our hero) or ""devolve"" (bonies, zombies who shed their outer skins, looking almost like black ghouls or skeletons). Speaking of bonies, I thought they looked amazing, creepy even, but their movements were stiff and made them look computer-generated. Also, who knew that eating brains for zombies could be a way for them to live vicariously the past life of the person they ate, through visions. It's not even the only way they can ""change"", although the other way, though nice, seemed a bit far-fetched and too quick. Fourth original element was that there was sometimes a humanistic, hopeful even, vibe to the proceedings despite the dramatic elements. There's something at the end involving the zombies and the bonies that I had never seen before. So the movie is more original than one might think, however the execution wasn't flawless.Sure, overall, I found the movie had charms, but for me the laughs were few and far between, like most romantic comedies I suppose. Because it's supposed to be one of those, but with obviously more somber elements. The drama could have used more ""teeth"" to make this film truly memorable and moving though. The movie even made me think of Romeo & Juliet as well as Edward Scissorhands, not bad stories to be associated with. The creators never really went into total parody or silly mode, which I think was a smart choice. What really took me out of the picture at several occasions though is that they didn't follow their own internal rules. We're told by our hero that zombies can only shamble slowly, yet not long after, we see zombies running. It's like they can have bursts of speed at will. Also, bonies, for some reason, move fast despite being in a more advanced stage of zombification. Also, I know it's a short movie, but zombies ""evolve"" too quickly, especially the best friend. Acting was fairly good, not exceptional, but I particularly liked the main character. Why? Because he's a nice, smart freak, quite lonely and having trouble to express his feelings in words and actions, but able to be slowly ""healed"" by kindness and love. It made him interesting and relatable to me and probably others. Yes, the movie could even be seen as an allegory on solitude, not fitting in, and how hard it is to truly connect to others in modern society.Zombie makeup was rather minimal, and they managed to make the protagonist kind of attractive, in a goth-like way, mostly because of his great hair and pale blue eyes. I thought there were wasted opportunities with the concept, but it could have been done much, much worse. So, I liked the movie, I would even recommend it to most people not allergic to zombies to see a different take on them. It's very minimally bloody and the most ""gory"" part is when they show a zombie shedding his skin to become a bonie, and even that's not too disgusting. I think it would make a good date movie. Warm Bodies didn't leave me cold and the more I dwell on it, the warmer my feelings for it get.Rating: 7 out of 10 (Good)",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Romance"
I Loved This Cute Movie,"In a post-apocalyptic United States of America, the survivors live in a city surrounded by walls that separate them from the living dead. Their leader Grigio (John Malkovich) sends a group of teenagers, including his daughter Julie (Teresa Palmer), her boyfriend Perry (Dave Franco) and her friend Nora (Analeigh Tipton), to the outside to collect food and supplies for the population. However, they are surprised by a group of zombies. Among them, R (Nicholas Hoult), who is a young zombie without recollections but very introspective.R eats Perry's brain and revives his memories and sensations with Julie, and he falls in love with her. R saves Julie from the other zombies and hides her in the plane where he lives. Along the days, they develop a weird relationship and become friends. When a group of zombies led by R's friend M (Rob Corddry) finds Julie, R protects her. Soon the zombies including R change their emotions and are capable to dream. But the fearful Bonies are seeking out Julie and R to eat them.""Warm Bodies"" is a movie that combines comedy with romance, horror and action genres. The story is brainless since the very beginning; for example, a group of teenagers go to a dangerous environment without any skilled soldier to help them. But the delightful story is worthwhile; the zombie with existential crisis is adorable; Julie comparing R with the cover of Lucio Fulci's ""Zombie"" in Blu-Ray is cult; the chemistry and the romance are adorable and in the end I loved this cute movie. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""Meu Namorado é um Zumbi"" (""My Boyfriend is a Zombie"")Note: On 01 May 2019, I saw this film again.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Romance"
Entertaining from start to finish,"'Warm Bodies' is a fantastic film about a zombie named 'R' who falls in love with a human and tries his best to protect her from the rest of the zombies.The plot is very strange but if you embrace its weirdness and eccentricity then it is brilliant. A lot of people have described it as being like Twilight except with zombies but it is far better – there's depth to the characters, a lot of really funny and embarrassing scenes but there is also a lot of really frightening parts which I did not expect. I am glad there were some scary moments, with zombies you expect a little scare here and there regardless of the genre but, I am surprised at the films' 12a rating. The plot is well paced and you're not bored or waiting for something interesting to happen – the film entertains you from start to finish.Nicholas Hoult is brilliant in this; it must have been difficult to do this role – especially without blinking most of the time. It's good to see that he is making it in large popular films now because he fully deserves it. Theresa Palmer is also really good; it's nice to see a female lead have some humorous scenes for a change compared to the mind- numbingly dull Bella in Twilight. Dave Franco was also really good here but he was not in the film for very long which is a shame because he can be really funny.Overall, this is a really funny film with a decent amount of horror included. If you are considering taking children between 8 and12 you should know that there are some pretty frightening scenes. There's a fairly small amount of gore but the 'boneys' can be quite scary – particularly towards the end. However, the film is really nice, funny and even heart-warming sometimes.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Romance"
Enjoyable zombie flick with comedic elements.,"A genuinely pleasant surprise! Here's a film that takes a dead-on-arrival plot (no pun intended) and turns it into something that is fresh for the uber-popular zombie genre. While the film gets off to a slow start and the acting can be *ahem* stiff at times, we as an audience are invested in this endearing and lovely relationship between the zombie, R, and his living girlfriend, Julie. We want to see them live happily together and survive in the odd, post-apocalyptic conditions that plague their world. I also can't help but dig the nice use of music in this film. Nice work!",,Anonymous,"Horror, Romance"
I'm surprised,"When I was going to see this movie, i was thinking that it gonna be another teen movie about a girl that's discover the natural identity of her boyfriend, but it wasn't like this, it was so much better, with alternative focus and interesting events this movie comes with a brand new type of history, a very well produced time line that will keep you with your eyes opened until the last second, it's simply awesome, great for family, adaptable for all ages, and will touch even the youngest and the oldest person that goes to see it, it's not a reflexive movie, that will be in your head for a long time, but it's a huge font of entertainment, i recommend it for all the people in the world. Of course, this movie has a lot of existing elements, that make it a little boring to see, but it's a great film for a Saturday night, to see with your friends. Thanks all of you, and sorry about my English, i'm from other country.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Romance"
Loved it,"I was looking forward to this since the moment I saw the trailer and so got myself out of bed for the 10:05 am showing on opening day. It looked funny, like 'Shaun of the Dead,' and seemed to have its own interesting take, which is rare in the zombie genre. Usually the plots of zombie films are about as aimless as the zombies. The best way to describe this film is a zombie romantic comedy. It does have some action and some tense moments later on but the initial set up is the zombie, R's, emotional growth and how meeting this girl sparks something in him to evolve. This is nothing like 'Twilight,' and those that are saying that have either not seen it or are too absorbed in the fact that the two leads are good looking, which is the only commonality this film has with 'Twilight.'But, let's face it, the majority of leads in films are attractive, so, that's not much to base a similarity on. 'Shaun of the Dead' was just a comedy, where this is a comedy with heart and depth. It's a satire, but they don't force feed the point of the film, instead they make it very subtle, which is nice.It wasn't a laugh-out-loud comedy, but I don't know that I necessarily thought it would be when I saw the trailer. It definitely had more emotional depth than I thought it would which gave me a much fonder attachment to the film than if it had simply been made for laughs. The two leads had great chemistry and were believable and well cast. The directing, writing, and pretty much everything in the film was well done. I have no complaints. It delivered what it said it would and exceeded my expectations which is rare these days in entertainment.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Romance"
"Give it a try, it may surprise you!","This movie was great! I brought my friends and they thought it was going to be lame but they ended up loving it just as much as I did! Go see this movie, its adorable! I loved how its dark and gory in a cute way. This movie is funny, suspenseful, a little bit of a horror and romantic; its the perfect date movie! I don't get scared easily but this movie made me jump a few times... The whole movie i was entertained! I was very impressed with the way the make-up and hair team were able to make the zombies so realistic! R was very easy to relate with and this movie has a little bit of everything for everyone. I suggest going even if your a bit skeptic about it. Go out and see this movie!",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Romance"
Zombie Love,"R (Nicholas Hoult) is a zombie, but he's trying to remember his human life. He's barely about to grunt a word out, and he has a friend (Rob Corddry) sort of. While hunting, R runs into human Julie. He falls for the girl, and saves her from the zombie pack.There are a lot of zombie movies out there. I mean aaaalottttt. So it's not surprising that people are trying to explore a more expansive zombie universe. Zombies are faster, slower, funnier, and parodied. Now zombies are falling in love.It's something new. I wouldn't say it's funny. It's not. It is curious, and somewhat sweet. Nicholas Hoult is a good emo zombie. The difficulty lies with the grunting halting speech. It makes the dialog hard to listen to. This makes the interior narration absolutely vital. It was probably important to try even more internal dialog.As for Teresa Palmer, I'm not sure she's star material. She's a really pretty girl. I really like her, but I still see her as the girlfriend character. The other girl in the movie is Analeigh Tipton. She might be marginally better as the lead. She seems to have a little more comedic skills.I am very happy that people aren't just doing the same old zombie movie over and over again. This story had obvious obstacles. I think it overcame most of them relatively well.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Romance"
"""Warm bodies"" embodies so many parodies","I went to see ""Warm Bodies"" on opening night, something I rarely do. I have to say, I wasn't disappointed in this strangely romantic comedy. Don't be turned off by the premise of a zombie romantic comedy - it manages to parody human relationships on many levels the way ""Shaun of the Dead"" parodied zombie movies. Nicholas Holt does a wonderful job parodying the awkward teenager filled with angst and a longing to connect, yet his inner dialog makes for much of the movie's comedy. He manages to have a bromance and a romance and make you laugh at the same time. Rob Corddry does a wonderful job holding up his end of the bromance if you will, and I didn't even catch his part in aiding the Shakespearian nod. Yes, this movie manages to pull a pun on Shakespeare while also light-heartedly setting out themes for what defines a person as human. Teresa Palmer does a wonderful job rounding out the chick flick humor with Analeigh Tipton. I thoroughly enjoyed the film and will be going to see it again. I was too busy laughing to see the plot holes.I also have purposefully avoided reading the book, so I wouldn't have any preconceived notions of the movie. I get that the book was much darker than the film, which would set a viewer up for disappointment in a romantic comedy.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Romance"
Surprisingly lovely,"This film isn't your usual Zombie film, yes there is a load of zombies in it but it is with a twist. This time it is about good zombies. There is still quite a few fight scenes but nothing over the top/too gory.I didn't think this plot could work, a zombie and a human forming a relationship? it sounds silly but it actually works! The excellent Nicholas Hoult portrays 'R' the zombie extremely well and the on screen friendship he forms with Julie (Teresa Palmer) is really touching. OK it is a bit predictable but the way it all developed is great and we are left with a great ending.I think this film will really surprise a few people, it is definitely worth watching. A romantic film which includes zombies and is also funny, a winner for me.8/10",,Anonymous,"Horror, Romance"
"""The unspeakable in full pursuit of the uneatable."" - Oscar Wilde","Ah, a love story that proves you ""R"" what you eat. Taken from the original story of Capulet and Montague - revised as ""R"" and Julie.Before you get the feeling that this is just another cross-species love story you find it also an action movie with a fast car and guns. There is some nice music; too bad that they did not play ""Muskrat Love."" We even have a swimming pool scene in which they are not wearing swimsuits. The balcony scene is a tad too familiar. It is the East and Julie is the sun!This presentation is a cut above a lot of the later zombie movies. It is a story about love and redemption. It may even have a redeeming value for us as we learn all zombies are not the same.For DVD viewers there are the standard extras that do not add much to the experience except for the voice-over that tells what you are supposed to be seeing.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Romance"
Zombies Can Be Good Guys Too?,"Cutesy and heartwarming. I enjoyed it. To be realistically critical, Nicholas Hoult really carried this movie. I've watched it a few times because it really is a feel good movie while also being clever. This was released during a heavy ""zombie"" movie time, and managed to stand out. While not making fun of the genre, it does make light and make the genre a little more fun. Anyone can change right? Rob Corddry is an amazing addition! As a sidekick he nails the timing and, weirdly, subtlety needed to almost steal the show. But Nicholas Hoult can't be out done. There's lots of cheese in this movie and Hoult makes it palatable. His progression out of a mythological stereotype in to a hero trope is a fun journey. Hoult shows depth in each stage of his character, while also making the transition between stages feel seamless and human. Worth watching, don't take too seriously, enjoy!",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Romance"
Thoroughly enjoyable movie,This movie was a lot of fun to watch. It is a twist on the zombie genre unlike anything you have ever seen. There is nothing too offensive or gory in this - the creators kept it clean and not too scary for a full-on zombie flick. There are your typical shot to the head to kill the zombies but those quick scenes are nothing compared to watching 10 minutes of The Walking Dead or the like. I am always concerned because I have seen so many movies over the years where the creators did not know how to properly end the story. So many movies are great the first hour and then end poorly. I thought this had one of the best endings I have ever seen. Enjoy!,10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Romance"
Zombie movie with lessons for humanity,"Warm Bodies is a movie that I did not expect too much from. zombies, head shots and jump scares as normal zombie flicks, but it turned out to be unexpectedly beautiful.The movie revolves around a zombie who seems to be semi-conscious from the very beginning, and is narrating the movie all by itself. but trapped in a zombie body, he is unable to communicate and even speak clearly, all he can do is fumble a few words time and again. as the movie advances, he meets a human girl and starts have feelings for her, and that feeling of love makes him gradually more and more human. That is what the movie basically is about, but on the deeper side, the zombies in the movie try to teach what is it to be feel love, pain and how precious it is to be human, a simple fact that we are taking for granted. The movie also conveys the message of accepting change and getting along with each other. Most importantly, what i believe the movie says is that love, compassion and humanity lies at the very core of being human, and love can break down the strongest of walls. All of this is in the 90 some minutes of fun filled journey, with good acting and considerably good screen play, and quite funny dialogues. A nice movie that i would recommend to everyone.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Romance"
Romeo and Juliet... and Zombie,"I have to say 'Warm Bodies' is more of a love story than of a zombie story. For the first part of the movie, I was a little confused that zombies in this movie do not show typical characteristics of them: empty, rotten, slow, infectious, turning others into zombie by eating flesh, making monstrous sound, and etc. R can run, think, and feel. I was holding onto something I could not solve. I kept thinking 'Gosh, somebody explain how this Zombie works. This does not make sense. Why is R so different from other zombies? How does it define Zombie?' However, once I let go of the zombie part, I could finally be engrossed in the story and appreciate the movie as it is. 'Zombie' part is just a tool to emphasize the differences of species. It is interchangeable: looks, heights, skin colors, ethnicity, nationality, social status, and anything that parts human beings based on narrow views. Ordinary zombie movies are full of violence, blood, grotesque, clamor, and chaos. However, 'Warm Bodies' is even serene. Audience can empathize that R and Julie have really missed the nature and the open field because the director portrays sunset and rain so nostalgically. Finally I want to add I love Nicholas Hoult's acting. He 'nails' at being vulnerable but protective of the one he loves. R is hopelessly in love with Julie, and Hoult really conveys passion, eagerness, and affection with his acting.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Romance"
Irresistable,Very beautifully made movie . As a viewer you are actually getting to know the life of zombies . I just loved this film as it's so wonderfully made.

"Why, oh Why","First: Zombie with white teeth. Because if there's one thing the human flesh eating undead care about, it's dental hygiene. I'm in the first 37 mins of this movie and I can only ask myself why I wasted my time (seeing it free so not my money). And what is Hollywood's obsession with trying to make young ladies like me fall in love with zombies, werewolves and vampires. Are they just setting us up to lower our expectations about all men? Choose between an animal, the undead or the actual dead. Honestly, I'm watching this movie as a parody because I cannot see how it can be addressed otherwise. I will not address the plethora of faults in every scene and in the plot because my fellow reviewers have done it justice. Skip this movie. To my friends who are making me watch this un-ironically; we might have to reconsider our relationship.",1.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Romance"
Make way for a teenage zombie that is sure to be the best surprise to kick off the new year.,"Here's something you don't see every day: A romantic comedy involving zombies. Thus, ""Warm Bodies"", a fresh, fast-paced, sensational and truly original delight that is sure to knock your socks off from beginning to end. Start with the premise: After an plague has caused people to turn into zombies, the real humans including General Grigio (John Malkovich) separate themselves from the brain-eating zombies by building up a wall in order to keep them away. Along the way, we get to meet one of those zombies. Meet R (the charming British heartthrob Nicholas Hoult). He doesn't quite like this life, knowing that he has to eat brains in order to survive and to live off the memories of the humans he's killed. He's looking for someone to connect to, which is really explained through his facial expressions and inner monologues. Then it's love at first bite, when he's finally connecting to Julie (Australian beauty Teresa Palmer), daughter of General Grigio. When he sees her after she shoots most of his friends, he decides to protect her and to ""keep her safe"". Yes, this zombie is in love. Protecting her in his abandoned airplane filled with vinyl records, a record player, and other resourceful things, R finally gets to realize that something was missing in him all along, leaving his heart beating to realize that he loves her. That's when R, his friend M (a wonderful Rob Corddry) and the other zombies are starting to change. That's all good, until the CG skeletal creatures known as Bonies will do anything to prevent that from happening, which leads off into the film's fantastical climax. ""Warm Bodies"", directed by Jonathan Levine (of the delightful comedy-drama ""50/50"" and the incredibly wicked ""The Wackness""), who also adapted the film from Isaac Marion's bestselling book for young adults, combines a mixture of 5 different genres (comedy, horror, romance, drama, even a little bit of sci-fi) that makes the film more smarter and even more better than ""The Twilight Saga"". (Take that, Jacob Black.) What also makes it work is the inspired casting of Nicholas Hoult from ""About a Boy"", ""X-men: First Class"" and the upcoming ""Jack the Giant Slayer"". As R, he literally dives deep into the emotions as well as having terrific comic timing through his expressions and his inner monologues by using a spot-on American accent. He also develops great chemistry with Teresa Palmer, known as the butt-kicking alien Six in ""I Am Number Four"", who, as Julie, has a tough and fearless personality as well as a emotional side to her. The supporting cast is also incredible, including Analeigh Tipton, who is hilarious as Julie's friend, Nora, Dave Franco (James's little brother from last year's ""21 Jump Street"") who gets a brief amount of screen time, but really sticks it out as Julie's ex-boyfriend, Perry, who (in order not to spoil this) gets called for a dinner date that includes brains on the menu and the great John Malkovich excels as a man who believes that the zombies are nothing more than just flesh-eating corpses looking forward to get shot in the head, but doesn't believe that his only daughter is in love with one. I know what you're thinking, this is just another zombie movie. But ""Warm Bodies"" is certainly different than that. It revives the zombie genre by bringing something original to the screen. For those who love the TV series ""The Walking Dead"" and the other zombie comedies ""Zombieland"" and ""Shaun of the Dead"", not to mention George A. Romero ""...of the Dead"" series, you actually will get a taste of what the zombie world is like through the eyes of one. And maybe like R's, your heart will warm up too. This is the best surprise so far this year. Note: ""Warm Bodies"" is pretty tame, but pushing the envelope for a PG-13 film involving zombies who eats brains and Bonies who consumes hearts. Those are hardly seen, but there are people who shoot zombies in the head with guns. That works in order to keep it very organic.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Romance"
Romeo of the Zombies and Juliet of the Humans,"Many references to the typical impossible love stories of a Romeo & Juliet kind. Entertaining, with humour and teenage problematics. More than I expected.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Romance"
Borderline Unwatchable,"I really, really wanted to like this movie. I liked the idea of the perspective shift, the trailer narration presents R as an interesting misfit, a little too alive to be a zombie and much too dead to be anything else. I love a good horror-comedy, and what better to poke fun at then undead romance? The storyline centers around a near future where the unspecified virus breaks loose and the remaining humans build a fortress to keep out the zombies. It adds its own twist that zombies, while some stay conscious like the hero, R, others simply give up hope, and become the 'Bonies'; a skeletal group of who are merciless and bloodthirsty, you know, like a zombie. So in that, I guess I was thinking there was a good set up for some more psychological conflict, especially if it's supposed to be based off of Romeo and Juliet where people do, you know, *actually* die.I don't know why I was expecting so much. I was already expecting zombies, but none of them have so much as a missing hand or a vacant eye socket. It's the equivalent of the glittering vampire; unmutilated zombies, who are pale, blue eyed, and stare longingly. Of all the plot holes you could drive a convertible through, that one bothered me the most. To be fair, I think one of the little kid zombies was missing teeth.I would give you a synopsis of this movie but there doesn't seem to be a point. It's pretty typical boy meets girl, falls in love, overcomes differences. As for being a comedy, the plot is too straight forward for anything besides a few cheap laughs. It takes itself too seriously to poke fun at things like Julie's controlling father, or how awkward zombie kisses could be, and not seriously enough to give any kind of emotional depth to the characters. The relationship between Julie and R reminded me much more of Tarzan and Jane than Romeo and Juliet.I suppose if you're looking for a fun date movie with the all the appeal of the word zombie and none of the gore, horror or anything relevant to the title, and you're still in high school, this movie has appeal. Maybe if you read the book you'll have some appreciation that I didn't. If you have to do your own laundry, or have ever had a relationship with any real emotional substance, Warm Bodies will at best leave you feeling a bit tepid.",1.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Romance"
Clever,A cute and clever take on the zombie-genre. Hoult's narrative adds some that helps the zombie lover in me get through it all. I view it less as a zombie film and more as a romantic comedy with flesh-eating as a backdrop.,7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Romance"
"To hell with Edward, here comes R!","Old conception, new point of view. Anyone who wishes to discover in detail the future universe in which zombies are crowding the planet, anyone who claims elaborate answers for the hows, whens and whys should go elsewhere. This movie is sweet, funny and entertaining. It possesses all the elements a good romantic comedy should and still it's not too cheesy. The performances are decent, not very memorable but believable. Nicholas Hoult's performance is beyond average. The soundtrack is excellent, it fits the movie's style and mood perfectly. All in all this one works much better than the similar-themed Twilight saga but it's not a big miracle considering that the latter doesn't work at all...I recommend it to those who wish to be entertained by a well-thought out, funny romantic comedy with a lot of action and originality considering it's genre.

A pleasant little zombie film,"On the face of it, 'Warm Bodies' is a very interesting film: one part zombie-action movie, one part comedy-romance, and one part whimsical science fiction. In practice, it isn't quite as interesting as it sounds, because each of three elements is actually quite generic, even though they're cleverly interspersed. Overall, the film has a nice mood, although veering heavily towards the sentimental, supported by the kind of folkie soundtrack that seems to be de-rigour in a certain sort of movie (in spite of the genre-bending, think 'Garden State' and you won't be too far out). And if it seems strange to summarise a zombie flick as pleasant viewing, in this case it's correct call.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Romance"
Cold body. Warm heart.,"Before the trailer was released, everyone thought ""Warm Bodies"" was going to be ""Twilight with zombies,"" although some would argue that ""Twilight"" was already filled with zombies. However, I'm happy to put this issue to rest: ""Warm Bodies"" is nothing like ""Twilight."" They're not even in the same family tree. In fact, ""Warm Bodies"" is a clever take on the Romeo and Juliet story, spinning the zombie genre on its head. The way the film subverts and even breaks the rules of your typical zombie movie gave the film some freedom to play with the material that no other zombie movies have done before.Now this may anger die-hard zombie fans, like how ""Twilight"" angered vampire fans. After all, zombies can't talk. That's just pure blasphemy! In this world, they do. Pure and simple. If it takes a film to break the rules in order to breathe in new life to a certain genre (i.e. ""The Cabin in the Woods,"" ""Scream"") and to tell more refreshing stories, I want more filmmakers to start breaking the rules. ""Warm Bodies"" is unlike any zombie flick OR romantic-comedy you've ever seen before. It's original. It's unique. It's invigorating. It's just plain exciting to watch unfold on screen.The film has its funny moments and its horror moments, but what really sells the film is its genuine heart. Its plea for hope, compassion, and empathy is something rarely seen in films, and it works without feeling like it's hitting us over in the head with it. There are moments where you get to know the characters - and I mean really get to know them - that are so poignant and unexpected that it hits you right in the heart. And I cried. Oh, yes, I did. Several times, in fact. It also helps that the film's leads, Nicholas Hoult and Teresa Palmer, are terrific and have great chemistry as well. Rob Corddry is quickly becoming one of my favorite actors, and he has some great moments in the film. Additionally, Dave Franco is pretty damn good, especially if you consider the unconventional way the filmmakers develop his character.To say the least, ""Warm Bodies"" blew me away. It's an extremely well made film with an even greater story to support it. However, coming from ""50/50"" director Jonathan Levine, it also shouldn't be that surprising. ""Warm Bodies"" is already a contender to be one of the best films of 2013.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Romance"
Twighlight officially sucks after watching this!!!!!,"YES..it is another vampire love story movie, but guess what? There's better humor and of course the point where its definitely a unique type of story. The part of the movie that makes it more interesting is they made it to the way comedy/love/vampire gore and most of all action scenes to were they should be placed at the right moment. Although, its the typical zombies eat human, who would ever thought of why not making a Romeo and Juliet zombie kinda movie. Its pure genius, Better yet..Props to the person who wrote it.

Girlfriend being kidnapped by lover in a plane and felt so at home....reading books, listening to music....oh come On!And those white teeth R has after eating human brains.....Don't know if i miss a scene of R brushing his teeth after every meal.Lucky I walked out, would have gone mad seeing them kiss in the end.**warning** this movie murders the walking dead TV series... if you watch the walking dead, DO NOT WATCH THIS.",1.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Romance"
"Funny and Sweet, like Wall-E mixed with a zombie movie","And they said you couldn't have a zombie romance story. Take that vampires!The zombie R was surprisingly strong, but sensitive, sweet, loving, and protective. He wanted to talk to the pretty girl but had trouble finding the words, or at least vocalizing them. His determination and frantic antics were endearing.Julie was not some wussy victim or brainless babe. It made me happy to see she was tough and could take care of herself. She had a rebellious streak that made her entertaining to watch and a softer affectionate side that showed itself with R.I can honestly say I liked both characters and wanted to see them succeed.I particularly enjoyed the scenes where R eats the brains and we saw more of Julie, her old boyfriend, her father, and how they all fit together. It was heart felt and well-done. The relationships and the complexity of them was less evident in the movie than in the book but I could still feel it. If you liked the movie I highly suggest reading the book, by the way.Warm Bodies was well paced and acted, and one of the better zombie movies I have seen.

Too bad the marketing ruined it,"I've read the book and like most adaptations, it would be easy to say the book was better. This one is not the exception, unfortunately. But let's focus on the movie.What ruined this movie is the simple fact that they spoiled the entire story in the trailers and marketing. ""Their love is the cure"". Seriously? Am I supposed to hope they DON'T fall in love? They could have based the trailers and marketing on the fact that ""R"" (Nicholas Hoult) is a self-aware, thinking and undead zombie and it would be enough to make me wonder what a zombie's life is about. They thought knowing the climax from the start wasn't a problem apparently.For those who like to compare this to the Twilight franchise, personally I wouldn't. It's not meant to be neither epic or a ""saga"". Yes, it's a surreal teenager love story but they clearly don't have the same approach. If you look for Twi-like movies, watch the trailers before Warm Bodies and you'll find plenty.This movie is still somewhat fun with some funny lines and expressions but quite inconsistent. The characters felt dry and shallow. The drama bits were barely affecting the characters or the story. The action is basic and mostly made of CGI. The story felt simply felt rushed and there was no tension to keep me entertained.Maybe this flick will appeal to younger people and those who haven't read the book but as a movie on it's own, I can't give it more than a 6/10. It's an ""ok"" movie.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Romance"
"Wry and clever, tonally unique.","This reviewer was drawn into an early screening designed to generate buzz concerning the worth of the same, so I suppose my end of the deal is to afford such. With this firmly in mind, well - so be it! I rather liked the promotional trailer, drawn as I was to the wry tone and unlikely re-imagining of the zombie genre even as I care little for horror or gore. Fear existed that the premise wouldn't be exploited to the full or that the film would register across just the bits shared in the preview. Such anxieties were misplaced for the film proved consistently entertaining throughout and perhaps better than expected.Much relies upon the capacity of the viewer to accept if not celebrate the understated tone of what is nevertheless an over-the-top zombie picture. The voice over narration provided to us by the 'R' character, affording calm, matter of fact reportage concerning the 'lived experience' of being one of the undead; i.e. charting meaningless time spent will either connect or not connect, where I was pleased to note that the audience in attendance quietly gathered and enjoyed many a little nuance presented for our collective delectation. No one could help by find the tone and direction of this pleasant lark of a date movie anything less than winning. Expect to have a nice time.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Romance"
"Short, sweet and crisp","I had skipped on this one expecting it to be another zombie movie and since I had not read the book I was not sure whether I wanted to actually watch it but then I recently read some blogs that carried praises for this movie and that Is why I decided to give it a try.Warm bodies is a simple and fortunately well paced movie that does not stall or hover around much and thus giving a decent watch. I for one did not find this movie overly exciting or boring. It was good and watchable with certain elements of humor though for some reason I found the plot a bit undercooked. But it is kind of a recurring phenomenon with any movies that is adapted from a book. Usually during the transition from a book to movie, the details get omitted, maybe because of time constraints or for movie sensibilities.In short it is a sweet romantic comedy that follows the age old story of Romeo and Juliet except in this case our Romeo is a zombie and Juliet a living person.Review after reading the bookafter reading the book, i feel that the book is a much better version though yes certain blanks were filled on reading the book and the movie had kind of left out certain parts but still book was kind of tough to keep track of and movie was much more enjoyable in terms of plot and narration",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Romance"

A further extension of the great zombie genre,"Warm Bodies (2013)A surprising, imperfect, slightly adolescent movie that has enough guts and originality to make it glow. It actually toys with being a masterpiece—but don't go comparing it to ""The Hunger Games"" which has a similar audience and much more complete follow through. ""Warm Bodies"" takes the notion of zombies that have a little heart, and hope, and turns it into a vaguely Romeo and Juliet story.The star, the zombie who shows signs of depth, is pretty amazing, and he makes the movie. Nicholas Hoult, who had a significant role in the excellent Tom Ford movie ""A Single Man,"" comes across here with far more nuance than you're supposed to get with a zombie. And that's the idea. He plays it from all ends, the automaton and the deeply feeling youth.Across from him is Teresa Palmer who is fine, though she leaves the transcending to Hoult. Palmer's character is Julia, and Hoult's is just called R (because he can't remember the rest)hence a hint of Juliet and Romeo. (There's even a balcony scene, though they don't play out the echoes beyond that.) Julie's evil father who doesn't understand the other side of life is played by John Malkevich with familiar distinction. Well cast.Around them all is a world that is not so different from other zombie worlds— the endangered human sections and the wild and dangerous zombie sections. They are separated by a wall (just as in ""World War Z"" and others) and the wall, of course, is breached. This is a given, and a good necessity. What zombies eat, and what becomes of them, you'll have to see. This movie takes a slightly different take than others, and that's its optimistic magic.But it's not a riveting masterpiece. There are some sections that just don't work outside of their core audience—young people in love. The posturing and conversations sometimes dip into obvious clichés. But not often. And the best parts are original and great fun.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Romance"
A wonderful film in every sense. Watch it and fall in love again,"""Opposite attracts"" - Have not we heard of this phrase before ? Warm Bodies follow the theme of classic fairy tale - The Beauty and the Beast. It is warm , affectionate , loving and exciting.Soon after Julie gets trap into the world of Zombies , R protects her and keeps her safe. They develop a strong bond and soon creates situation which will embark on new journey for lifeless and give zombies a chance to regain their life back.Based on popular novel of same name by Isaac Marion, Warm Bodies is directed by Jonathan Levine who gave riveting drama 50/50. The glowing reviews and good box office collection of Warm Bodies made me watch the film and I loved it immediately. Right from the beginning , the narration-style is interesting by Nicholas Waltz and so is his wonderful acting. The story becomes more catchy when he bring Julie to his world and chemistry between them is awesome. Direction is simply superb . Levine brings yet another film which is entertaining and soulful. The screenplay is crispy and tight. Dialogues are punching. Editing is very good. The art direction is great. Cinematography is decent. I like the background score of the film. Nicholas Waltz ( Aboout a boy) is the next superstar . He is definitely an actor in making. He is spontaneous, humorous and fits into the character. Teresa Palmer has girl-next-door charm and still gives a commendable performance.Overall , a wonderful film in every sense. Watch it and fall in love again . Excellent 4.5/5",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Romance"
A different twist on the zombie genre,"Warm Bodies is harmless fun. It's a new twist on the zombie genre that features pretty good acting from the cast, especially Nicholas Hoult. The movie did feel a bit rushed, though, and some plot ideas aren't fleshed out (ha!) enough. The story isn't as sappy as I was expecting, but it also isn't as funny as I was expecting, either. Warm Bodies could work as a gateway movie to get certain people to watch other, better zombie movies.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Romance"
"Definitely not the new twilight, take that however you wish","In case the summary caught your attention let me explain. A lot of people where expecting this movie to be the new tween supernatural romance flick ala Twilight now that the series is done with making movies. Whether you want it to be or not Warm Bodies is NOT a twilight movie. In fact it's almost a parody of the twilight-esc genre that apparently exists now. If you knew about this movie and didn't expect the next twilight you where probably expecting the next shaun of the dead and well... it's not really that either. Most of the observational humor on the zombie genre is given at the beginning of the movie and then that's kind of it. Shean of the dead is a romantic comedy with zombies in it. Warm bodies is romeo and juliet except romeo is a zombie. Seriously the zombie's name is R and the girl's name julie.To be honest it's really not that bad, it stays funny the whole first act then slips into romantic territory for the second, but not twilight romantic where absolute jack sh** is happening between the two lovers except sexual tension and stupidity, but more of the romantic comedy style that this movie is trying to be so that's nice. And the third blends the comedy and romance with a bit of zombie flick action. The whole thing is a bit too cutsie poo for horror fans and a bit too scary for kids so there's a pretty small demographic for this movie but I'd recommend it none the less.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Romance"

There are some genuinely funny moments.I rented it to start and like it so much I bought two DVDs, one to keep and one to loan. Everyone who I know loved it as well.

Charming Zombies,"Who knew that zombies could be so charming? I didn't know much about Warm Bodies going into it, and I left pleasantly surprised. The two leads have excellent chemistry and Nicholas Hoult fully embraces his role.There are some overly convenient plot points, specifically those involving Julie's dad. Honestly, if you could take him out of the movie, it would probably go up a point (I never thought I would say that about John Malkovich).While a little more depth would have been nice, this film is a fun ride. There is a purity to it that I enjoyed and that is largely due to the two leads.Best Character: R

Surprisingly great,"This movie came as a surprise to most people when it was initially released. I expected great things from it after having read the book and that's exactly what I got. Warm Bodies is a charming teen zom rom com. What makes it works as well as it does is the effective chemistry between R played a sexy Nicholas Hoult and a feisty Teresa Palmer. The supporting work from John Malkovich, Analeigh Tipton, Dave Franco and especially Rob Corddry isn't to shabby either. Jonathan Levine takes his premise seriously but also with a winking eye. The movie can be creepy, funny and romantic and the red stuff is kept to a minimum but is there surprisingly. Also impressive is Levines screenplay it keeps the story, engaging and creative taking the concept into unexpected and appreciated areas. All in all it's a fun, surprising little gem that's quite entertaining.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Romance"

Zombie narrator discovers Twilight love,"What if zombies had thoughts running through their heads as they lunged around? And what if you made a movie from their pov? That seems to have been the whole concept here, and a story was worked out. The idea itself is a good one, not unlike the Tucker and Dale movie from last year, and perhaps long due. Horror, effective horror, has been all about placing us closer to the nature of the horrific experience, it's why as early as the 1960's, monsters were dragged from swamps and castles and moved next door to Bates motel.And what better placement than making us the monster?So they could have this as a black comedy, and I'd be a happy viewer. We'd see all those situations we know from zombie movies, but from behind the zombie mist of dumb instincts looking out at human instincts, in a way that drove home the absurdity and dumbness, drawing the same parallels that Romero did in his time. We are in Romero's timeline anyway, Land of the Dead.But for reasons that strike me as more shrewd than creative, they decided this should be a romantic movie. The idea here is to have the zombie narrator as one of the target audience, a teenager baffled at the 'deadness' of modern life, a music geek and awkward with the girl he loves, stuttering every time. Clever so far.Where it completely loses me as a viewer, is that the decision was made, and this had to have been part of a shrewd business plan, that there is currently no better mode to rope more of that teenage audience than Twilight. The franchise has come and gone, but the ripples are still being felt, especially in a film like this.What the Twilight influence means is that there is the angle of forbidden love, forbidden because of social constructs. They found a mopey, Kristen Stewart lookalike to be the sullen heroine. There is a more elaborate mythos, introducing zombies which are more evil than 'regular' ones. And it all has to culminate with an 'epic' battle and redemptive aftermath. Worst of all, and this is why I rate the film so low, is that mopey, wistful tone that probably passes as introspection in high-school corridors. There's even the inane visual bit, the equivalent of sparkly vampires, with the hearts of 'awakened' zombies beating red!You'll know the filmmaker is a dull mind, if you observe the scene, it's a small moment but very indicative, where 'good' zombies have decided to make a stand, rousing Scorpions music kicks in the soundtrack; instead of giving us say a flat, comedic side-shot where zombies simply limp along into the frame one by one, he has them coolly walk towards the camera... in slow motion!Which defeats their actual stumbling in slow motion, all so we can have a useless Reservoir Dogs effect.",,Anonymous,"Horror, Romance"
The power of Love,"Well, it's my 1st review here and I wish it would be helpful for others who are going to watch this movie. The power of Love can do anything, even can make Zombies change and bring them back to life. This is the movie message, I think. I'm not a Zombies fan at all but I really liked this movie. Go watch it and you will really get inspired. I liked the movie story and scenario. May be the actors performance wasn't v.good but you can say that it was satisfying enough. I liked M(Rob Corddry) scenes, his performance was really good.I thought that I was going to see a movie like Twilight, I think that it's totally different, romantic scenes here are not made in an exaggerated way like twilight. I liked the sound track of warm bodies v much as well.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Romance"
Irony befalls this title.,"After seeing the trailer for this film I knew I had to see it. It's an interesting concept about the human condition being the cure for all things, even the zombie apocalypse...Grant it it would never work but the charm is there. Here's where irony befalls this title; all the charm and character in this film is found in the undead characters. If it was intentional by the writer than kudos, but I highly doubt it.I loved the zombies in this movie if it had been just a 40 minute short film it would have really worked. Lets say the zombie R was a lot closer to the human enclave not living in an airport; the group of survivors get swarmed, hopefully in a much more intelligent manor, and R of course saves the girl but she returns home. Periodically R visits her after following her through her secret entrance one day after she goes out and gathers supplies a second time and a bond finally forms when she realizes she can trust him. Bing bong boom there's your foundation. Just a thought because there were so many plot holes with the idea of these kids growing up in a zombie infested world; why would they be so careless. Okay step one when scavenging supplies don't play video games you stupid ass! Step two if there is only one door why not put a couple people on it to secure any dangers, especially when you think you hear something that could be a potential threat, and finally why the hell would you let a zombie get that close to your face!?!!!?The humans in this movie were dumb! Just completely and utterly stupid! I did not care about them at all and if they were to die than good riddance because they were too stupid to be a survivor; dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb only begins to describe them and their actions and sadly there was no plot except for the love story...oh wait yeah there were the ""Bonies"" which is a dumb name but I get the reason for it those enemies are skeletons...clever. But if those things were not involved than what would be the conflict...oh the f*cking zombies!!! See your story falls apart when you throw in a weak subplot known as the ""Bonies."" It's a lame stretch to make it so the human looking zombies are little better than the skeleton zombies. No!!! What you do is actually flesh out your characters you gave R a reason to be compassionate he wishes to communicate again to feel alive; why not have some of the zombies understand his motives and wish to help while others are just crazy cannibals. Than you have even more plight when the humans have to fight off the zombies because now they can't judge by appearance alone, makes it a bit more gripping.Now don't get me wrong I enjoyed 40% of this film the stuff with the zombies was great, it was funny at times and the character R was charming. The girl he falls for however was boring, stupid, and lacked all personality. It was like watching Kristen Stewart if Kristen Stewart was blonde had a better rack and no chipmunk teeth. R shows a lot of personality and character with his undead hobby of collecting and listening to vinyl and the guy likes Springsteen which is awesome! That girl would not know who Springsteen was I'm sure her modern day personality would go straight for the Justin Beiber and never look back. She barely talks about anything pressing except when can she leave...hmmm why not use your survival skills and leave you are the daughter of the leader of the human resistance you can't fight with melee weapons are you dense!! Doesn't matter point being even in the flashback or dream sequences she yammers on about how life is so detrimental and we need to exhume humanity...ugh now you sound like a pretentious hipster who uses words like exhume to sound smart, I hate you.I'm pissing a lot on this movie I know, but its because they took a very charming short film concept and padded it out with pre-teen nonsense; driving a car real fast on an airport strip would be fun I don't want to watch that though, not in a zombie film. Also if it took place more in the survivor enclave then we could have dove into the social hierarchy that was obviously going on. Near the end our characters go down into what looks like a refugee camp, in comparison to the mansions these white girls were living in; okay what the hell is that about why are these people living in filth and you are living it up in a mansion. I can assume because your dad has power but now it looks like he abuses his position and makes him a bit of an asshole; bam another plot point that would have been so much more interesting to see!!!Yeah you guys dropped the ball on some real social issues that are plaguing our society. But I do appreciate the daydream of life before the outbreak where R talks about how it must have been great to simply enjoy the company of other human beings back then; however, it shows a bunch of people on their cell phones and ipods not paying any attention to the physical presence of the people around them...Brilliant!!! You just made a perfect analogy of our modern lifestyle to that of a zombie apocalypse, we may as well all be dead because we lack the abilities to socialize, f**king brilliant!! And you capitalized on it by showing a zombie trying so damn hard to simply speak to a living human being....BRILLIANT!!!!!!!!! But then you dropped it and made it a teenage love story, as if like we haven't already suffered the Twilight saga.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Romance"

I loved it because I was so engrossed in the film. During the action/thriller scenes I was at the end of my seat, hoping everything would turn out okay. During the comedy scenes I was falling back laughing at what had just happened. During the romance scenes, I was tearing up and even thinking of how much I love my boyfriend.

Pretty good,"While this is above the Revenant level of humor/horror (conceived as PG-13 mind you), it still is unable to reach the heights of a movie called Deadhead. Still if you are looking for a romantic zombie comedy and you have already watched the ""Deadhead"" movie (which also includes the ""road movie"" aspect), than there aren't that many movies to chose from anyway.The lead actor is good and his ""side-kick"" is pretty funny too. Our female lead is as beautiful as it gets and while not all of her decisions seem rational, this still is a movie and shouldn't be measured to hard on that front. The internal logic is working and the movies pace is good enough. Of course it is predictable, but that doesn't mean you can't have fun with it",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Romance"
Great little film,"I rented this film because of the trailer. I'm not a zombie fan, in fact this is the first zombie film I've seen, but the trailer was funny and I thought, why not? I totally enjoyed this film. It's a sweet, well acted, little gem. Analeigh Tipton is brilliant! I will be looking for more of her work in the future. I'm not sure that this film will please die hard zombie fans. Not much gore really and it is more of a love story but it is amusing, down right funny in places, and the characters are all likable.""R"" is not only charming and handsome, the inside of his plane is fabulous, a set that's little bit of paradise for ""quirky stuff"" mongers, like me. So overall I certainly recommend this film with the caveat that it is subtle. If you want buckets of blood, a lot of violence, amazing CG gore and wild, over the top laughs this probably is not for you, which is fine because I highly recommend it to just about everyone else.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Romance"
"about equal with ""Shaun of the Dead"" and ""Zombieland""","These zombie-genre-benders have had a good run, and ""Warm Bodies"" love story theme works about as well as I could have hoped.There are many ""explanations"" that could have been better developed/explained, but some sharp casting, solid art direction, and fantastic music really pull this thing together to be one of the early, pleasant surprises for 2013.While I said that some things could have been better examined, and they could have, the lead character's journey comes off as completely genuine. The timeline for his ""transformation"", and the ""heart"" behind it are pitch-perfect.The humor is subtler than it could have been, but that actually fits the mood of the entire film.Theresa Palmer and Nic Holt have fantastic chemistry and bright futures.The film wouldn't work without all the early, well-written narration. And the more I think about - the lack of explanation may be there, but the story has the backbone to help the audience draw many of it's own conclusions.I don't want to raise expectations too high, but this might be about even with Shaun of the Dead, and perhaps a touch better than Zombieland(even though I rated all 3-7/10). IMO Zombieland starts out funnier than this but fizzles a bit late. Shaun of the Dead is funnier too, but for me that music(I'm buying this soundtrack) and the love story(which probably gives this more mass appeal) make ""Warm Bodies"" as good or better.You might like this if you liked:duh..Zombieland, Shaun of the Dead, or Dear Beautiful(2009).73/100",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Romance"
Zombie film is no horror but rather a labour of love.,"Entering the new post-'Twilight' era, a few teen-romance-type films have been showing around St Valentine's Day. 'Beautiful Creatures' is one, 'Warm Bodies' is another. Both films are essentially love stories and both have the same plot. Whilst 'BC' competes with 'Twilight' on a 'I Married A Witch' type of plot, 'WB' has a zombie theme. However it should be clearly stated that this is a teen-romance love-story not a zombie film. The zombie theme is there and provides the backdrop to the story. All the basic plot-lines of zombie films are there, but are cleverly subverted in this rom-com film.Like 'BC' this film opens with a narration by the male lead. In 'WB', Nicholas Hoult, a tall thin lad, plays the male lead. As the credits roll, he explains that he is a zombie in a zombie-inhabited post-apocalypse world. This world is seen through his eyes throughout the film. This is his film and his world. At the start of the film the zombies appear rather like many stoned teenagers; they slouch about a lot, they wander aimlessly about with hunched shoulders.By a quirk of fate, male lead encounters female lead played by Teresa Palmer. Fate throws them together as it did Richard Hanney and the girl in 'The Thirty-Nine Steps'. Not handcuffed in the Highlands, but brought together, and hiding together, in this dangerous post-apocalyptic zombie-infested urban world. The result is the same. Male lead however, is a gawky youth, who struggles to impress the more vivacious girl. These scenes are played very naturally, the two leads play their roles well and convince in the reality of their relationship and the reality of their situation.The situation that is their reality, is the old story of love across the tracks. It becomes clear that this is a modern reworking of an old love story. It is blatantly so and the film revels in it. The standard themes are there, circumstances seem to prevent a relationship, their worlds are so different and the gulf between them too big. Like 'BC' we have the complication of family. We just know that the girl's father is not going to be accepting of this relationship.The stern father is played well by John Malkovich. Two other supporting parts are also well played. Analeigh Tipton gives a very believable performance as the girl's best friend. Rob Corddry, who this reviewer last saw sitting in a hot tub and a time machine in 'Hot Tub Time Machine', a surprisingly good and thoughtful film, in which RC gave a performance of some depth, in this film, he RC, plays the best friend of the gawky youth. Despite the subject matter of the film, here again, RC, gives a performance of depth that convinces in his role.Watch out for some scenes that are truly well filmed. The post-apocalypse suburbia is most impressive as are some of the swooping panoramic camera shots. No less impressive are the country scenes, the dream scenes and the gritty city scenes. Rated 12A in the UK, the film, whilst not gore-filled, is surprisingly grim. Dining-out is of course part of the film, and the zombie chase scenes are quite scary. The trailer for this film showed zombie fight scenes, and this reviewer was not impressed with those or looking forward to them. However, in the film itself, the fight scenes were done well and fitted well. Having said all that however, this film is a rom-com, and as such is entertaining and quietly funny.In boy-meets-girl romance stories it is very difficult to make a film that entertains, holds the tension, keeps you wondering if the romantic interest can grow into love, and how it will end, all the while maintaining, and not breaking, genre rules. This film does all that perfectly, from the very start to the very end.'WB', like 'BC', is a perfect date-movie for all young lovers, it did, in fact, surpass my expectations and therefore I have no hesitation in awarding it 10/10.",,Anonymous,"Horror, Romance"
Where for art thou R.,"Warm bodies is the story of zombie R and his journey back to humanity after he meets the girl of his dreams. A journey that not only changes his life ( or unlife ) but also those similarly afflicted.After bumping into Julie while her and some other survivors are out looking for supplies. He feels something change in himself and decides to rescue her from his zombie cohorts and it's from this point on we see R shamble his way back to the world of the living.The movie is a great romantic comedy. While not laugh out loud it does have it's moments. The two leads relationship is very convincing and is good fun to see it grow throughout. Even the smaller interactions Between Julie, R and their friends are good fun too. There are some great riffs on the whole Romeo and Juliet angle ( R and Julie ) even down to a whole balcony scene.It does have a tendency to go a bit too syrupy at times (one E.T. type moment) and it does occasionally border on the cheesy but never enough to ruin it.The make up for all the zombies look great as does the set design for the post apocalyptic world. Effects wise the only thing that lets the movie down are the Bonies. The skeleton like evil zombies should have been creepy but they just looked a bit too cartoony and could easily have been done with some super skinny actors in Prostetic make up. The fact they looked so lame did suck the tension out of some scenes but it was still good.Warm bodies is a great date night movie and has something for everyone.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Romance"
Zombies CAN be Funny and Romantic,"A Zombie finds love in the shape of a victim's girlfriend and feels something 'stirring'. Underneath the smart Alec jokes, grim setting and Zombie 'frolics' what you have here is basically a morality play that proves the old adage that 'love conquers all'. The film starts off in familiar Zombie Apocalypse territory with hordes of the reanimated shuffling around an airport then we meet Hoult's 'R' a Zombie clearly struggling with his new found place in things. The most refreshing part of the film is not the Zombies and the Land of the Dead-esque situation but the blossoming love story between the leads which is handled brilliantly and sets up the ending very well. All in all a good 'Rom-com' that plays on its strengths but will probably annoy the hell out of hard bitten (heh) Zombie fans.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Romance"
Great Film,"To be honest I wasn't expecting much from this film given how the storyline read on the cover, I didn't really believe it would be my my kind of thing, but being a fan of zombie movies in general I thought I would give it a go.

It was very funny in places with an odd and very dark humour, also scary and quite jumpy from time to time, and it has to be said the strangest storyline ever. I love the way it gave an alternative view on zombies, giving them personalty. The character R was played extremely well by Nicholas Hoult, you just love him from the start and root for him until the end, brain munching and all! Highly recommended, and a must see!",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Romance"
Great movie from start to finish,"Warm bodies is now one of the best movies I've seen this year. The idea was great. In all other zombie movies, it's always about how zombies are disgusting and for the amount of blood you see. But in this one, the zombies, they hate their life, they want to change back. At first, I wasn't to sure about always hearing R (Nicolas Hoult) speaking to himself, but as the movie continued, I thought is was very interesting idea and that was the comedic aspect of the movie.I am a big action-horror-comedy movies fan, so I adored this movie. You laugh, there is the horror part when the zombies attack the group in the pharmacy and of course the action part during the movie.So I advise you all to watch this movie, it is so good.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Romance"
The sweetest zombie movie ever made,"This is probably among the most unusual zombie movies ever filmed, but before you prepare yourself for fright, there is very little. However, there is some wonderful narration all coming from the mind of the mostly dead character portrayed by Nicholas Hoult and there is a lot of humor in this, but mostly and oddly its biggest attribute is warmth. This is a love story between a normal young woman and a dead young man. None of it makes any sense, which is an odd thing to say about a zombie movie since the whole concept doesn't make any sense, though there are some general zombie genre rules that are not followed here. Hoult is the focal point and he is delightful in the most unusual ways. He somehow also manages to still be adorable even as a dead man. The person that revitalizes the humanity in him is played well by Teresa Palmer with added fun supplied by Rob Corddry and Lio Tipton. This is pretty much unlike any other film though that doesn't make it uniquely great, but it is an enjoyable little movie.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Romance"
Only Lukewarm,"""Warm Bodies"" is only lukewarm. A zombie named R (Nicholas Hoult) eats the brains of Perry (Dave Franco) and thereby falls in love with Perry's girlfriend, Julie (Teresa Palmer). The movie is meant to be a bit scary, a bit funny, and a bit romantic, but I wasn't much scared, I didn't laugh, and the romance was stale and flatfooted.Julie and R jump into a sports car to escape from menacing zombies and skeletons. The top is down; it begins to rain. They drive into an abandoned, post-Apocalyptic suburban neighborhood. Julie is cold; she has to take off her clothes. She does so in front of R. Teresa Palmer is a very beautiful young woman. R is a frustrated teen zombie madly in love with Julie. The director does absolutely nothing with this scene. There's no special lighting; the camera doesn't show us Julie's beauty as desperate, lovestruck R would see it.There are multiple chase scenes, none of which make much sense. Julie sees her well-armed father in a convoy and does nothing to join him, but later escapes on her own to join him, a much riskier trip. Why didn't she go earlier? No explanation.If you're looking for a funny zombie movie, check out ""Shaun of the Dead,"" and ""Zombieland."" If you're looking for a fully realized romance between a living woman and a dead man, watch ""The Ghost and Mrs. Muir"" and ""Truly Madly Deeply."" If you like romances between women and monsters, see Jean Cocteau's ""Beauty and the Beast,"" or ""King Kong.""""Warm Bodies"" isn't a bad movie. It has its moments. R whines to his fellow zombie, Rob Corddry, about Julie, and Corddry's one word responses is the funniest line in the movie. The movie's conclusion is heartwarming if a bit half-baked.",4.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Romance"
Not at all what you think it is,"I watched this film because my teenager wanted to watch it, but I wasn't expecting much. I thought, ""Oh, it's just Twilight but with zombies."" Boy, was I wrong.From the first few moments of R's voice-over narration, you can tell that it's actually not cheesy. He sheds a humorous light on his predicament and you're immediately rooting for him. The actual plot of the movie, while not totally unique, is oddly refreshing. You get the sense that both R and Julie are sincere & not that much different from any other teens their ages. They're just in another place and time.Warm Bodies has elements of sci-fi, action/adventure, romance, drama, and comedy. Even if you don't like sappy romance movies or don't think you can sit through one more zombie movie, see this one. You won't be disappointed.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Romance"
Cold body. Warm heart.,"Nicholas Hoult (""Renfield"") plays ""R"", a zombie in a post-apocalypse future. He calls himself that because all that he can remember is that his first name possibly began with ""R"". When he sees Julie (Teresa Palmer, ""I Am Number Four""), a scrappy human survivor, something stirs inside him, even more so when he eats her boyfriends' brains. Now, he is truly smitten with her, to the point, that he'd rather keep her safe than eat HER brains. And she, in turn, realizes that he's not like most zombies, and feels something for him as well.Scripted by director Jonathan Levine, from the novel by Isaac Marion, ""Warm Bodies"" is a zombie film with a difference. It's not really for hardcore horror fans or people who shy away from anything they perceive as ""mushy"", but it has a real heart & poignancy, not to mention the kind of humanity that you don't always get in zombie films. There IS some ropey CGI; there are digital monsters called ""bonies"", which are basically the final stage of zombies. There's also very little gore for a zombie film. But people hoping to see a fresh spin on this enduring sub-genre will be rewarded with an appealing romance that just happens to take place in a horror film setting.Hoult and Palmer are very engaging, and they receive strong support from able veteran John Malkovich (""In the Line of Fire"") and a creditable Rob Corddry (""Hot Tub Time Machine""), who plays a fellow zombie who is loyal and helpful. He has an especially effective scene where his long-buried memories are re-awakened.At the core is a memorable main character whose thoughts are still quite coherent and intelligent; ""R"" can reflect on his condition even if giving voice to his thoughts is difficult.All in all, I have to admit that I enjoyed this one.Seven out of 10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Romance"

"A Hilarious ""Zomedy!""","When we imagine a post-apocalyptic world, it usually includes a lot of broken down buildings, stray dogs and a bunch of raggedy and tough survivors, but rarely zombies! Warm Bodies, rated PG-13, is a hilarious look at what could be, a world in which humans are uncommon and zombies roam the land looking for fresh bodies to eat.This may not sound appealing, but according to 15-year-old KIDS FIRST! Film Critic, Raven Devanney, it's actually quite hilarious. And if your grandkids aren't squeamish about the idea of zombies, then you might consider this film for some mid-winter entertainment. As a quirky romance / comedy / horror film, it stands to remind us of the true meaning of humanity and the importance of staying connected with others.Go here to see Raven's full video review! http://www.you-tube.com/watch? v=iDEmy4NlziMWarm Bodies Reviewed by Raven Devanney, KIDS FIRST! Film Critic, age 15The newest addition to the Zombie, Romance, Comedy and Horror genre. I call it, a Zombromance, or a Zomedy! It's set in a post apocalyptic world consisting of zombies, bonies and a small population of humans. When a zombie named R (Nicholas Hoult) meets a Human girl named Julie, he starts to feel like there is more to life than just being the walking dead. He begins to cure himself, retrain himself to talk and become more human. He inspires more zombies to try to cure themselves, and slowly they begin to become more human. Will R and Julie defy the odds and stay together, or will the fact that one of them is a zombie keep them apart?I absolutely adore this movie. I will definitely see it over and over again. When I think of zombie movies I think of nasty rotting creatures and lots of blood and gore. Naturally the zombies eat people in this movie, but it is filmed in such a way that brought a sense of humor to the whole thing and the blood was very minimal. Even the zombies don't look that bad. In fact, Nicholas Hoult makes one attractive zombie! I like the lighting and sets in this film a lot. You can definitely tell that it is a post apocalyptic world, but the zombies still try to maintain somewhat consistent routines. I thought it was cool too see zombie security guards and janitors. Although they weren't doing much, you still got the sense that there was some humanity left in them.My favorite character is R because he is such a sweetheart. He goes against his urge to eat people to save Julie and he proves that he is more than just a mindless flesh eater. Even though he is relearning how to speak, he is still quite slow so he can only mutter out simple words and phrases. Nicholas Hoult does a fantastic job keeping this character dull and Zombie-like, while still giving glimpses of his emotions and personality. This movie shows that R still has completely normal thoughts, he just can't express them, as if he is trapped in his own mind. R voiced over most of the movie and it was hilarious to hear what he was thinking, compared to what he was actually able to do. He made me laugh even in more intense situations, making him my absolute favorite character.I can't say I have a favorite scene because this whole movie is incredibly well done. I do love all the times that R and his Zombie friend M or ""Marcus"" interact. They try to communicate and connect and it's so funny and touching to see their friendship show even though it's challenging for them to express it. I also really enjoy the seen when Julie (Teresa Palmer) and her friend Nora (Analeigh Tipton) give R a makeover. R is so reluctant to have makeup put on him, which I thought was funny because most teenage boys are. The music in this scene was particularly funny and entertaining and it is a memorable scene.I think there are so many underlying messages in this film, but the one that stands out to me most is that we need to take the time to connect with our surroundings and the people in our lives. In this film it shows a flashback to the world before the zombie outbreak, and R is saying that back then everyone could connect, but in the flashback everyone is on their phones texting or playing video games. It is a really strong reminder that we are so wired and constantly tuned into technology that we often forget to be with our family and connect with our loved onesI recommend this film for ages 13 and up because teens and even adults will love this movie, but kids under the age of 13 may find it to be too mature. I give Warm Bodies 10 out of 10 stars so go check it out at a theater near you!",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Romance"
New good twist on the genre,"This is something different, a zombie movie but a Romantic Comedy at that, and a movie where it for most parts take the Zombie side, shows what he/they think and do and how they live.The genre being comedy might be a bit off, yes it has humor and funny moments, but it is mostly small laughs not big ones, and there is many moments where it is more in drama mode and maybe even action mode, well maybe comedy suits it all right.This is a new good twist on the genre, there are good performances by all the actors, especially the main characters R played by Nicholas Hoult and Julie played by Teresa Palmer do a very nice job, but also the side characters have great personalities and characteristics.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Romance"
"Cool concept, not much else","Warm Bodies is the story about a zombie called ""R"" which falls in love with a human. The idea of this movie is pretty cool. It is very different from all of the other zombie movies. The idea of zombies having personalities and such is pretty cool.Apart from that, the movie is kind of boring in my opinion. Like, nothing really interesting happens. Most of the time is spent developing the two main leads, which have a very boring chemistry. The rest of the characters are clichés like ""the over-protective father"".Im giving this movie a 6/10 because I did like how the protagonist develops throughout the film into a more rounded character, but besides him, the rest of the characters don't have much development.I saw this movie in a 12 hour long trip in a bus, and that is exactly where it belongs. A fun movie that you can watch in TV or in a bus when you have nothing better to do. It provides some original and fun concepts but nothing else.If you want a better zombie comedy I suggest you watch ""Shaun of the Dead"" or ""Zombieland"" which I absolutely love.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Romance"
A high school movie of a Romantic Zombie,"This zombie made all zombies a joke. Of course Hollywood approved this trash but nevertheless here it is on IMDb with a rating of 7.3. Simply amazing that this movie has garnished such reviews and ratings. What were people thinking when they seen this? Cute? Heart-warming? Loving? I mean this movie wasn't realistic in any sense even for a Zombie movie. Zombies uniting together and having hearts of a human??? Original in a bad way people but because the people of today are very much simple minded and perhaps there are many women rating this or something is beyond my understanding. Movies that really deserve a 7 or higher get rated 4's and 5's but this one has changed my mind on folk who do rate low.Production value is not bad, acting not bad, Ponies not bad, lol and idea wasn't bad but this movie had a strong way of annoyance with the humans and zombies working together due to a couple comprising of a boy zombie and a girl. Talking Zombies is not bad but those that feel... can love... can become human again is not something that should have ever been done. Kissing the dead... BIG NO! What perverted person could ever get away with away with that? Let it been a woman zombie kissing a man and this be on the cover of Newsweekly for a sham.This is a movie for a group of illiterate high school minded folk who get kicks of this mess. Pure calamity of the horror genre. Waste of my time after watching another waste of my time watching Jack the Giant Slayer. Hollywood could only be the one to get away of Zombies becoming Human.

"Surprisingly fleshed out, heartwarming, self-aware and not overly-romanticised teen romance story.","Expecting a Twilight-inspired romanticised version of another well-known supernatural concept that are zombies with an underdeveloped cliched post-apocalyptic setting, the movie surprises the audience with a well-realised world with a light-hearted and not overly-romantic love story with a deeper relevance to the overall status quo than most.While movies of the same ""genre"" portray a love story centered in the unlikely relationship between two different ""species"" of creatures, this movie approaches it by deconstructing, in a way, the ""zombie science"" behind not in a way that could scientifically explain the logic behind the decisions it makes throughout the movie but rather by applying a viable approach to a more visceral cure to the zombies.The film is not meant to be taken too seriously as it's many inconsistencies and unrealistic portrayal of the zombies provide a more plausible chance for both the leads to have a resonating romance. However, the story feels well-developed thanks to the inclusion of other creatures and characters that provide more layers to the story making it possible for it to have more to say than simply study the possibilites of a cross-species romance.While some of the supporting characters may feel bland and underdeveloped the mere presence and attempt at a backstory in all of them and the fact they have a purpose to the story makes it not only welcomed but engaging. Some situations would seem unlikely and there are some scenes that do feel misplaced as their sole purpose do reminisce of teen movie-tropes like the typical makeover scene or several of the slightly abused montage scenes.Moreover, while at first the overall execution of zombie mannerisms such as growling, slow walking and dismembering due to rotting flesh began to lack as the plot unraveled, rather than becoming an overlooked inconsistency the movie stands out for providing a reasonable explanation pertaining to the core of the story. And the film provides a sense of finality and earned romance between the two leads as it provides a conclusion to the problem of the zombie apocalypse.Regardless of whether the novel it's based on belongs to a saga of more books, the film provides a self-contained decently fleshed out story that benefits from not receiving follow-ups to its story as it has told everything it needed in a single film. While some matters and situations needed of a little more development, the movie decides to rush through them in order to meet the runtime. Matters that could have benefited from those extra minutes are instead tailored to allow a consistent story and a good pacing to a story that is too creative to fit in only one film.IN CONCLUSION, the movie is a well-realized, endearing and light-hearted story of two teens that fall in love in an unfashionable way but whose story holds more weight in the overal story and outcome of the setting it takes place. It isn't too deep or has relevant themes to learn from or communicate to the audience, it's self-contained and affects solely in the story that it's trying to tell. But it's a feel-good and uplifting movie.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Romance"
Should have been weirder,"This film is weird, but still not unique enough to stand out much in my mind. The cgi hasn't aged well. The premise is interesting but overall it turns into a ""Romeo and Juliet"" type love story which was disappointing. I also think they could have shown the impact of zombification more on those left alive which would have made one reveal later in the film to be more impactful. I don't think it's a bad film, but it could have been better. If you scare easily and still want to get into zombie films then this might be an ok starting point for you.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Romance"
Now we know what all those zombies are REALLY thinking,"In the long annals of walking dead fiction, ""Warm Bodies"" is likely the first work to ever actually get inside the head of a zombie. And it turns out his thinking process is not all that different from yours or mine - if you can just get past that whole ""I want to eat your brains"" thing, that is.Skillfully written and directed by Jonathan Levine, ""Warm Bodies"" may not be the first attempt at a zombie-movie parody - ""Shaun of the Dead,"" ""Zombieland"" and ""Fido"" got there before it - but I'll bet it's the first to apply a ""Romeo and Juliet"" template to the genre (his name is ""R"" and hers is Julie, and there's even a charming balcony scene between the two to clinch the parallel).Nicholas Hoult plays a young walker who's been reduced to shambling aimlessly through the zombie-infested airport, playing vinyl records on the grounded jet he's converted into a comfy little ""home"" for himself, and mulling long and hard over what it means to be living out one's existence as one of the undead. He's not exactly proud of what he's become, but he's pretty much learned to accept it - that is until he devours the brain of Julie's boyfriend, thereby appropriating his memories and falling immediately in love with her. Our unlikely chivalric hero thereupon takes it upon himself to become the young woman's sole companion and protector as she tries to make her way through this dangerous and hostile world. And as Julie (Teresa Palmer) and R grow together in closeness and mutual understanding, R slowly but surely regains many of those precious qualities that once made him human.Based on the novel by Isaac Marion, Levine's screenplay, with its romantic tone and wry voice-over narration, is a subtle, gentle movie parody rather than a smart-alecky one on the order, say, of the ""Scary"" movie franchise or ""Date Movie"" and such. And it works beautifully from beginning to end, thanks in no small measure to the extraordinary chemistry between Hoult and Palmer in the starring roles (and Rod Corddry is equally great as R's best friend among the living dead).Corpse or no corpse, it's been a long time since the ineffability of young love has been captured so winningly on film. And the movie caps it all off with a coda that is about as sweet and uplifting as anything you're likely to see at the movies all year, guaranteed to make you feel proud to be a member of a species that, for all its faults, can still be pretty darn terrific when it puts its collective mind to it.It's nice to be reminded of that every now and again.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Romance"
Still a better love story than Twilight,"The movie uses forbidden love between two persons who present two completely different worlds which is not a new method but love with zombie, that is insane ! Recently, ghosts, vampires, and beasts have been noticeable as wonderful lovers in chick flicks. Nobody would think zombie would stand out (or fit in) as such sweet, attentive, WARM lover. Zombies in Warm Bodies are far from their relatives in The Walking Dead which people have been familiar with. Zombie R aka the narrator, for example, is a very good-looking, insightful, lovable brain-eating creature. The horror and romantic implements tremendously parallel throughout the movie. The love story of R and Julie is very interesting. The movie is funny and cute, not a bash of romance but full of optimism and actually clever.

Nothing special...Despite the premise,"I really wanted to be entertained with this flick but I just didn't find this movie to be all that enjoyable as I wanted it to be. If you seen the trailer everything about this flick is predictable and they put all the best parts in the trailer. Although this happens often and just lacked good development, emotion and humor. It's a romance flick that might get guy's attention since it's about a romance between a zombie and a human girl. But that is basically the only unique thing about this flick. What irritated me the most is the constant plot-holes that just doesn't make any sense. Usually I try to look past this but it just becomes to much. It's like they just didn't care and wanted to make a zombie romance flick. There is also this group of monsters called the Boneys, it's basically monsters that transformed from being zombies after a long period of time. But they are just in this flick so the humans and zombies can have a common enemy. The script just didn't seem well crafted or unique despite the human zombie relationship aspect of this story. Vampire romance has been done many times, even werewolves and other monsters or creatures and now it's zombies. And that is where this movie falters, it's just quickly becomes boring despite the premise. It's a watchable movie and better than the ""Twilight"" flick but just nothing special. I wouldn't be shocked if the makers of this was inspired by a video on Youtube called ""Zombie Love Song"" which is a more entertaining to watch.6.2/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Romance"

It's OK,"This movie makes you believe it is going to be hilarious, but not as many laughs occur as one would hope. The underlining tone of Romeo and Juliet is obvious.

Even if one could believe that a zombie could come back to life - the zombie should not lose all of it's scars that it earned along the way during the transformation.

Nicholas Sparks this ain't,"When the zombie craze hit America, circa 2009, it seemed to have swept everyone up except for myself. What can I say, I guess zombies just aren't something I will make a totally conscious effort to watch. I've enjoyed several zombie movies in my day, including George A. Romero's Dawn of the Dead and Ruben Fleischer's Zombieland, but have never watched a full minute of AMC's The Walking Dead. Perhaps I've just thrown all my zombie-credibility down the drain by revealing that.Nevertheless, I can hold an opinion on Johnathan Levine's Warm Bodies, a somewhat unique romantic-horror story centering on the romance between a beautiful living girl and an attractive dead boy. We open by seeing ""R"" (Nicholas Hoult), a young zombie wandering around an airport after a fairly recent zombie apocalypse that has claimed a good portion of the country's citizens. ""R"" can not speak coherently, holding conversations with passersby that rarely channel anything besides grunts and muffled groans. We get all his internal thoughts through open narration about how he can not remember his name, or how he became a zombie in the first place, and just wants to go back to being a normal human being.One day, ""R"" and a group of other dead souls run into a group of perfectly undead ones and a shootout begins. ""R"" winds up feasting on the brains of an innocent young male, and begins to get the man's memories flowing through his head. In them, he sees a beautiful, young, vibrant woman of golden blonde hair (his girlfriend), who just happens to be in the same room as this shootout is unfolding. She is Julie Grigio (Teresa Palmer), who ""R"" looks not to harm, but to protect from the undead army of people invading the remainder of the country. He takes her to an airplane that will serve as their closeted sanctuary, where she will teach him the ways of a human, and he will assure she is protected and cared for properly. The only minor problem is that Julie's oppressive dad (John Malkovich) runs a violent human group that is hellbent on searching for zombies and slaying them on impact.Writer/director Levine, who, two years ago, made one of the most heartwarming comedy-dramas of 2011, 50/50, juggles two genres here that haven't had the best treatment in recent years. The horror genre, which is so dreadfully lifeless it mimics the onslaught of zombies brought forth in this picture, and the romantic comedy genre, which is usually just reduced to incredulity and emotional manipulation, are merged with somewhat satisfactory results, yet this leaves the tone of Warm Bodies jumping all over the place. One thing that remains consistent, however, is the slowburn technique that Levine employs early. The film takes a while to get from place to place, and rarely focuses on anyone either than Hoult and Palmer, leaving a lion's weight of dependability on their chemistry together. Their chemistry works and elevates the film to a respectful status, and is without hesitation, the best part about this film.The problem with the tone is the main distraction, though. Warm Bodies jumps into so many different genre pools that it only manages to pull them off fairly, without much notable charm. The genre that comes out with the most due payed to it is definitely the romantic one, and as one watches the inevitability unfold, it's nothing but blunt to the audience that this is trying to attract the tween audience and get them hooked on what aspires to be the next big thing. Comparisons to the Twilight series have already been made, but this is a far less melodramatic exercise than those films proved to be. Yet, while Warm Bodies may provide one of the love interests with a different twist, it still carries us down the path of contrivance and inevitability we can foresee before the halfway point.Had this been R-rated, no pun intended, the horror possibilities could've been further exploited and the story may have evolved into something more than tween-fare. Alas, this isn't how the idea came to fruition, and perhaps this tween direction would've been more profitable and well-received than the path I would've rather seen this story take. Everyone involved is capable, the inspiration drawn from Romeo and Juliet is apparent, and the idea of focusing on a zombie character for once is a good one, and it should satisfy those seeking out a different kind of romantic comedy that injects flavor, wit, style, and potency without bearing the name ""Nicholas Sparks."" But the girls who are ""creeped out"" by zombies can comfortably standby for two weeks when Valentine's Day brings a film more up their alley.Starring: Nicholas Hault, Teresa Palmer, John Malkovich, and Rob Corddry.

A tender romantic zombie film,"I started watching it thinking it would be a simple parody, but I was shocked, it ignores all the rules of the zombie genre.The film tries to mix the tragic story of Romeo and Juliet with the adventures of a world full of zombies, which is quite absurd.It manages to cleverly transform a more than familiar story, with its drama, humour, a touch of horror and a nod to 90s romantic comedy, making the film a refreshing cliché.The make-up work is appreciated throughout the film, the acting, the soundtrack and the script.The film is narrated by our protagonist in a sarcastic manner, which is quite a comical touch, as he reveals his deepest thoughts and emotions, while his character can only communicate through grunts.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Romance"
I kissed a zombie,"Warm Bodies is a slacker zombie romance film with heart.It does owe a debt to the Twilight movies as well as Romeo and Juliet.

A zombie-romantic-comedy, if you like, which shows how original it is as I doubt any other movie has been described as that.Very interesting, quirky plot. Starts intriguingly and gathers momentum as it goes. Has a few periods when it becomes a bit of a mundane chase and/or action sequences, but these are short. Plot isn't entirely watertight either, but, considering the science-fiction nature and quirkiness of the movie, it can be forgiven for erring on the side of entertainment over flawless plot.Has some funny moments too.

The Vidiot Reviews,"Warm BodiesThe best thing about dating a zombie from a woman's perspective is that they don't have any issues with eating you out.However, this horror-comedy is told from the male zombie's perspective.Uninterested in the afterlife, R (Nicholas Hoult) is more intrigued with girls - one in particular.When R and his friends attack Julie (Teresa Palmer) and her boyfriend (Dave Franco) - who are on a mission for Julie's father (John Malkovich) - R falls in love.By ingesting her beau's brain, R's privy to Julie's memories, which he uses to woo her.But the two are torn apart when both their species are targeted by the next step in zombie evolution.An optimist outlook on the zombie apocalypse, Warm Bodies aptly balances satirical comedy with Bard inspired besotting, creating cult movie-like capabilities.Incidentally, which body-part would a zombie have to eat to learn how to get aroused again?Green Lightvidiotreviews.blogspot.com",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Romance"
Didn't care for it,"So I listened to acacia-ash23 and was disillusioned. I wasn't taken on a journey, just the airport and a plane and some halls and 2 houses.I think there wasn't a story to be told. Nothing in the film stuck with me. I was disappointed 'cause the trailer looked good, but the script was so far off from what I imagined it to be. Hmm, I also disliked 50/50 because the girlfriend seemed unrealistic, and the humour wasn't my style, and I found Kyle to be another stock character.

Unexpectedly entertaining,"I didn't expect much from this movie. There have been more than enough zombie films lately and the idea to mix it up a bit with Twilight-style romance didn't make it any better. But the trailer was interesting enough and the ratings were decent so I gave it a try. 1. The film is very even. And by that I mean there are no weak moments that you would like to skip. 2. There are no unnecessary details over what caused all the mess and why, and I liked it that way. 3. The soundtrack is worth noting. There are numerous nice old songs throughout the movie, a few modern ones (Chad Valley's Shell Suite was a find for me) and some original tracks when they are needed. 4. The acting is very good. I especially liked the supporting by Analeigh Tipton and Rob Corddry. Nicholas Hoult (R.) was good but since his zombie basically was deprived of emotions for the most part it is hard to judge his performance. Teresa Palmer was great at most scenes (especially showing terror), but some of others were unimpressive (balcony scene for one). I feel like in some scenes she didn't really understand what was required of her and the director didn't really help or correct her either. 5. There are enough funny moments. Just many enough and funny enough. 6. What I especially liked is how the important moments were mostly silent scenes. Really shows you don't have to talk to make a point, something I would like to see in other films. 7. The romantic part was charming and heartwarming. The leads definitely shared some chemistry.So overall I definitely recommend this. It's a romantic comedy and it nailed those aspects. It doesn't have the deepest of meanings but it's not shallow either.",,Anonymous,"Horror, Romance"
"I liked it, nothing like good clean wholesome zombie fun","So for those who haven't done their homework this is obviously a very different kind of zombie gig, and being how vampires, zombies, not to mention the imminent and ever approaching zombie apocalypse, mustaches, and glow in the dark zebra print duct tape are all in full bloom now, why not a touchy feely zombie flick? I mean really why not???Who knows, maybe we as a people have overcooked the same ham time and time again but I do have to say for what it's worth this film is original in that it's from the perspective of a zombie, and not only that but a zombie with thoughts who changes and causes others to change, and all for love. I mean what a sediment...So anyway, the movie is not one that I'd put in my top 10 list and will probably be forgotten over time as most spoof like movies are for me, but it was put together and flowed rather well. It had a different kind of heartbeat all on it's own (pun intended) and was enjoyable for me to watch. And that really is what it all boils down to is entertainment value right? I don't care if you're watching a movie about aids or a total comedy, if you are entertained and came out of it with something well then isn't that the whole point? This is obviously a lower budget movie with no big stars except for John Malkovich as most zombie like flicks are, but it had a totally different approach as pretty much given away by the trailers and such.In the end I liked it and wanted to see it first before showing my kids to make sure it was worth watching and not too graphic as they are totally into Plants vs. Zombies gig and all the like and would probably love this and I'll show it to them when it comes out on disk. The movie could have done without the one 'F' word scene although for me it made a good laugh, so eh nothing's perfect. It's by no means a summer Marvel blockbuster nor a Steven Spielberg great, but it stands on it's own and I give it a thumbs up.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Romance"

Now that's definitely not an award winning film but that's not the point; it does what it sets out to do, which is being entertaining from beginning to end in a cute way. On a personal note, the moral of the story that even a dead guy can find love when I can't manage to do that myself is a bit vexing but that's obviously a me problem.

Funny and Cute,"Let me just say that I typically don't like ""zom-coms"" for the simple reason that most of them just aren't that funny. Additionally, the idea of a romance between a person and a zombie fills me with revulsion. Having said that, I fully expected to be bored to tears or completely disgusted with this particular film. I was pleasantly surprised. Essentially, ""R"" (Nicholas Hoult) is a zombie who ambles along--day in and day out--doing what zombies typically do. Then one day he and a number of other zombies stumble upon a group of humans and while he is chowing down on one happens to see a beautiful woman named ""Julie"" (Teresa Palmer) who is surrounded and totally vulnerable. This strikes a strange impulse in his brain to protect her and lead her to a safe location. What follows is a story that is both funny and cute without getting too morbid or syrupy. Be that as it may, judging from some of the other reviews my opinion is not shared by everybody. To each his own. In any case, I didn't think this film was too bad and I rate it as slightly above average.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Romance"
A sweet and sincere Zombie themed romance with heart and brains.,"Following the zombie apocalypse, a zombie named R (Nicholas Hoult) shuffles aimlessly around his undead colony at an abandoned airport wishing for more meaningful connection than his exchanges of grunts and monosyllabic responses with his best friend M (Rob Corddry) before awaiting the inevitable fate of all Zombies where they shed their flesh and turn into the aggressive Boneys. On one of R's ""hunting"" trips to the city, R and his pack encounter a group of survivors and begin to feed. When R kills the groups leader Perry (Dave Franco) and engages in the act of eating Perry's brain for the purposes of reliving human emotions, a chance encounter with Julie (Teresa Palmer), Perry's girlfriend, leads R to try and protect her and take her back to his home. While Julie is initially scared of R, over time the two form a friendship that becomes something more and may even be the key to ending the zombie apocalypse. But both R and Julie must face off against the aggressive Boneys and Julie's battle hardened father and leader of the human survivors Colonel Grigio (John Malkovich).Based on the 2010 novel of the same name by author Isaac Marion, the film was written and directed by Jonathan Levine whose previous film, the critically acclaimed 50/50 served as a bridging point between Levine's indie material to more mainstream fare. At its core the movie follows a romantic setup similar to the likes of Beauty and the Beast or Edward Scissorhands (which Hoult said was an inspiration for how he approached the character) in finding the beauty beneath the surface, but the movie tackles this age old premise with humor, heart and brains.Nicolaus Hoult shows how strong a leading man he truly is in the role of R as much like the book, R is barely vocal with most of the insight into his character coming through in the form of voice narration and physical actions such as R's penchant for collecting Knick knacks or other articles for his collection in an old passenger jet he uses as a home. Hoult's performance both in voice over as well as on a physical level is really strong with his weary shuffling and guttural utterances gradually softening over time as we see his transformation towards becoming more human which aligns with his growing love of Julie. Julie makes an excellent foil for R with her optimism among the hardened denizens of the survivor colony making her an engaging character and a perfect match for R with them both trying to hold onto what it means to be ""human"" in a world of feral skeletons and battle hardened survivalists.The writing is really strong with Levine doing well translating the key aspects of Isaac Marion's book to screen keeping in tact the book's emotional core while adjusting some elements such as streamlining the workings of ""zombie society"" that were more detailed and in depth in the book but would not have leant themselves to narrative flow. The movie also gives one of the human characters a redemption arc where as in the book they were more an obstacle to be overcome and while some have said the book's take is more ""realistic"", I think the redemptive arc they take with the character falls more in line with the underlying theme of recapturing that lost humanity that both the zombies and the humans are trying to hold on to.Warm Bodies is one of the few Zombie films that will leave you feeling optimistic and hopeful for humanity's future and is a strong showcase for the talents of Nicholas Hoult and Teresa Palmer. With strong writing and insight on what it means to be human, Warm Bodies carries an unusual optimism not usually found in the subgenre that endears itself to the audience with likable characters and a strong emotional core that keeps you invested.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Romance"
Romeo and Juliet and Zombies,"Although an adaptation of a novel, ""Warm Bodies,"" the book and the movie, are clearly a reworking of Shakespeare's ""Romeo and Juliet."" ""Julie"" is short for Juliet, and ""R"" is for Romeo. Julie and R... are star-crossed lovers, and the feuding corpses and the living are the Montagues and Capulets. This all becomes exceedingly blatant in the balcony scene. Modern rom-coms, however, lack the heart, brains or guts for tragic romance, let alone iambic pentameter, and so we get skeletons, too, and a different ending. Instead of poetry, popular music. The awkward teenage yearning is still there, though. Dreams and monologues, too.I'm surprised to see that some commenters are surprised that they enjoyed this at all. ""Romeo and Juliet"" has been revered for over 400 years, and ""Warm Bodies"" is ""Romeo and Juliet""--albeit watered-down in its transmutation to the modern rom-com and zombie genres. But, yeah, cribbing Shakespeare works to an extent, because some of it's still as good as Shakespeare. It's just a rather, if you'll excuse me or not, undead version of the bard--grunting more than literate, not original but exhumed. There's a reason the zombie is the protagonist and narrator (other than traditional sexism); it's because this romance doesn't invent culture--doesn't breath life into it--it collects and hordes it: records, snow globes, even red convertibles and a lousy issue of People magazine. It consumes culture and life like zombies do flesh and brains, half-remembered and cannibalistic.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Romance"
Surprisingly fun and enjoyable zombie romantic/comedy,"While attempting to help rid the world of zombies, a woman finds that the zombie who saved her from an ambush has changed enough to fall in love with her and they set out to ensure those changes are brought to bear on their war with the undead world.This one was a pretty enjoyable and ultimately different take on the zombie film. What really holds this one up here is the fact that there's a really enjoyable attempt here to bridge the paranormal teen romance trend with a more traditional type of horror effort here, and its best moments are a combination of the two. While at its core the film is about the star-crossed romance between the zombie and a human, there's the attempts here at humanizing the zombies more than ever before in the genre here by showing them not only capable of simple, rudimentary behavior outside of the mindless need to feed on humans here by showing them gathering in diners, airports and shopping malls with a basic sense of familiarity to their previous lives, giving them crude language skills and other cognizant capabilities that are shown here to grant the romance more legs. While these here manage to make that aspect more believable, there's still a semblance here of this one being a horror film which makes this one still treat the zombies themselves as threats that need to be exterminated, from the opening ambush in the supply room where the whole adventure starts or the different encounters here with the bone-skeleton zombies who are much more of a general threat here by even having the zombies afraid of them as much as the rest of the humans are. As well, the film's big action scene battles here with the full-scale war between the two sides coming to fruition in the baseball stadium makes for a great showing of what the influx of the romance into the proceedings means here as they manage to make it not seem hokey or gimmicky that they've joined up here and come together, and all of this manages to make it quite enjoyable. There's a few small problems here, mostly with the fact that this one doesn't feel all too much like a true horror effort here with the concentration on the romance here, as while it's an integral part of the film it does tend to hold off the attacks possible to still keep the zombies as important figures here off in the background while they're together, and the fact that they don't even try to mount a search parties is a big flaw on its own that would've been a fantastic way to resolve those two issues at once. Likewise, there's also the fact that the skeleton-zombies here look utterly ridiculous with the atrocious CGI that doesn't come close to looking the slightest bit realistic or capable of putting them in the same scene with the rest of the cast here they stick out so badly here. Otherwise, this one was quite fun and much better than expected.Rated PG-13: Violence and Language.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Romance"

"A comedic 'human extinction' kind of approach, where the viewers feel no humor merely a tingling feeling of pity; towards the character and the screen writing.","A comedic 'human extinction' kind of approach, where the viewers feel no humor merely a tingling feeling of pity; towards the character and the screen writing. Warm bodies, a movie, describing the light in the end of the tunnel, for a disease that has taken over and spread throughout the world. A disease mentally and physically affecting the body to transform into a zombie, obviously. The humans have barricaded themselves from these low life creatures using a wall, calling it 'the wall,' obviously. A group of human volunteers were set on a mission, in the zombie territory. A girl by the name Juliet - played by Teresa Palmer- is saved from the terrors of zombies, once the mission failed,by a zombie called 'R' –played by Nicholas Hoult. He returns to his crib namely the airplane with the girl and the romance begins!It is always obvious what a movie is trying to reach out for; the underlying message the movie conveys through the characters. Even in the worst of circumstances-in other words-when it has failed to accomplish it"". This movie defines this statement. Warm bodies has attempted to enlighten the mind of the viewers that even the dead can be enlighten with love. Love is the pulse and beat of the heart. Indeed the events were in front of our eyes, the zombie was cured using love but the movie has failed to make us truly believe it. Probably the comedic approach was a little far-fetched, and ruined the message. The background narration by 'r' where we understand that the human and sane 'r' is speaking to inject humor into the movie. The humor thrown in between the lines was not caught by me, and felt irrelevant. Moreover, the idea of music playing every couple of seconds made me feel I have paid to watch a concert, a lifeless concert! The idea of music might have been to introduce life into the zombie and make him use it as a means to feel the richness of it words fall gracefully on his ears- like humans. Yet again failed and felt unbelievable!Since the movie is embarking on a 'zombie' journey, a new life has to be created by the screenwriter, a life with new rules. Where humans are on the edge of extinction and zombies have taken over! The new rules set in this movie seemed unrevised and reluctantly thrown into a paper using words and called a 'script.' I couldn't digest what the zombies can and cannot do. What was life there, the viewers couldn't live it. Can they talk? In the beginning the narrator states that conversations are at a minimum where one worded gestures are sufficient. Then 'r' suddenly is talking with a stutter to his comrade but what seemed a proper conversation.A scene three-quarters through the movie where R is looking for Juliet, and she happens to be on the balcony. That moment struck me; R and Juliet in a balcony THIS WAS A ROMEO AND JULIET SHOWDOWN. Where the high born Juliet is looking down at the low life, where their romance is odd in their society; and deemed as an impossibility. That moment will probably go down in history as the clearest example of a cliché, and how screenwriters grind through the chain of events to reach to something what they consider as epic but is silly at best. A screenplay's chain of events should be left to flow on its own, make it as if it was handpicked from life and shown in a four sided box.If R was make upped to look dark and gloomy then he is the light of this movie. His acting was rightly fit for this character, his change in his walking/running style was impeccable! The scene where he started devouring someone's brain and started exploring his memories; actually caught my eye a little off guard. I wished and hoped that the dramatic approach would be constantly used in this movie, but sadly disappointed.The 'memories' theme of the movies can be categorized under what worked in this movie. Along with 'r's acting, and the make up, the vitality of memories was felt by the viewers. It was really the thing which kept us thinking; and shows how the attempt was successful.If you want a romantic horror movie with a sprinkle of humor, and filled with clichés then this is your movie!",5.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Romance"

Good enough to make you root for it.,"""Warm Bodies"" is a nicely directed post-apocalyptic love story--that is at the very least--a fresh approach to a zombie film that is fully realized, and flushed out to satisfaction. ""Warm Bodies"" is a light comedy, which is often witty and consistently enjoyable. Levine's latest is well shot and possesses impressive production values. The film lacks any real thrills or major conflicts, but the romantic and comedic aspects are pleasant and effectively delivered with fine all around performances, while Jonathan Levine exhibits his skillful abilities behind the camera.Written and directed by Jonathan Levine (""50/50""), and adapted from the novel by Isaac Marion, ""Warm Bodies"" takes place in a post-apocalyptic world, following a plague that has wiped out millions. The remaining humans live behind a wall, surrounded by soldiers led by the human leader Grigio (John Malkovich). Meanwhile, the zombies mostly shuffle around an abandoned airport, only making occasional trips outside to feed on the living. Nicholas Hoult, our protagonist zombie named R, is amusing--stumbling and grunting his way around the airport. R explains his feelings in the voice-over narration, so the audience is always aware of his dreams and desires, and what is actually possible. When he meets Julie (Teresa Palmer), he is at the ultimate disadvantage - he's dead.On a feeding encounter with a human gathering party, R meets Julie and feels an urge to protect her. This sparks the beginnings of a strangely warm relationship that causes R to start to regain his humanity. As this change spreads throughout the undead population, Julie and R eventually find they are facing a larger issue--even as their friendship is challenged.""Warm Bodies"" lacks the ability to surprise, which makes it seems longer than it. However, Levine does a good job with the screenplay, balancing the right amount of fun and romance, as well as human dialogue with 'zombie talk.' Simply put, ""Warm Bodies"" is heart-warming and charming, when it could easily have been a romantic zombie disaster.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Romance"

But awkwardly he fell in love with a girl and that chemistry between them was so beautiful. Most zombie movies I have watched(resident evil,I am legend...)portrayed them negatively. But that's the first time you can see walking dead actually having a heart and can love.At the end that was the cure LOVE.Overall a really nice movie for everyone that conveys more than just being cliché romance. A good family-movie!.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Romance"
the strangest adaptation of Romeo & Juliet I've ever seen - fun zombie romance!,"As loose Shakespeare adaptations go, this could be the most unusual; zombies and humans as opposed to the montagues and the capulets. This was another success for Nicholas Hoult, who is ""so hot right now,"" and he was endearing, engaging and heart-warming in this as the zombie with a soul who falls in love with the girlfriend of the guy's brains he just ate, and got to know her through the guy's memories. She lives in the post-zombie apocalypse world, and her father is the general/leader of the army who is protecting humanity and obliterating the zombies outside of the city.R (Hoult) is the narrator of the film, with his inner thoughts that are still quite human. As he gets to know Julie, form a bond, he becomes more human again. Yes it's predictable, and rather fairy-tale-esque, a morality tale, but that doesn't detract from it's cute, romantic, funny and pleasing storytelling. It's definitely a feel good film, with a lot of heart. R reminisces about a time when people were together and connected, before they were zombies, and you see a flashback to people isolated all on their phones not communicating at all... poignant, perhaps suggesting that in the digital age when we are all connected but insular we are like zombies walking around in our own little earphoned worlds.Really enjoyed this, great special effects, stunts and make up and the CGI of the 'bonies' - the too-far-gone zombies who have given up the last of their humanity - was pretty good. John Malkovich in an unusual role of him, was good of course, and Teresa Palmer was also convincing and a sympathetic character as Julie. The viewer immediately is drawn to the gentle humour of R and he's just so adorable! Analeigh Tipton, Rob Corddry and Dave Franco were also good... Rob Corddry very good, actually, as the M the best zombie friend of R. Cory Hardrict - Kevin, one of the soldiers - was rather yummy! I recommend this, it's good clean fun; an improbable love story where true love conquers all, including being a corpse. A good zombie film for a girls night in or a romantic evening!",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Romance"
"I read the book, so...","OK, I have to admit I was very disappointed, but I was expecting it. For those of you who haven't read the book, please read it. There's much more to this than what the movie literally ruins. The only thing good I found on this movie were the actors, all of them 10 out of 10, and that's the only reason I'm giving the movie a 5 (specially for the actor playing M). I don't understand why a studio buys the rights for such a great story and then this is what they have to give us. They changed/removed what the story had best: depth and a message. It seems they decided to make this a ""twilight"" of zombies or something. So, I advise you all, read the book or you'll be missing out.

The film is not nearly as bad as 'TWILIGHT' (it's not even in the same league)!,"'WARM BODIES': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five)A zombie romance film based on the popular 2011 book, of the same name, by Isaac Marion. The film was written for the screen and directed by Jonathan Levine (Levine also directed the exceptional 2011 comedy-drama film about cancer called '50/50'). This film stars Nicholas Hoult (who's most well known as 'Beast' in the latest 'X-MEN' films, in which he met his now ex-girlfriend Jennifer Lawrence) as a zombie who is self aware and starts to become more and more human as he falls in love with a human survivalist (played by Teresa Palmer). It co-stars Rob Corddry, Analeigh Tipton, Dave Franco and John Malkovich. It's an interesting and unique take on the classic zombie film (as well as romance and it's been compared to 'Romeo and Juliet'). Whether it works or not is debatable but I mostly enjoyed it.The film is set in a zombie apocalypse where most of the human population has been turned into the undead, either the 'classic zombie' or a more severely inhuman skeletal like zombie creature known as 'bonies'. The surviving human population lives in a walled off enclave and are led by General Grigio (Malkovich). One day the General's daughter, Julie (Palmer), leads a group of her friends, including her boyfriend Perry (Franco) and best friend Nora (Tipton), out into zombie land to find medical supplies. They're attacked by zombies and Perry is killed by one, who's later known as R (Hoult). R is self aware (and narrates the film) and is immediately drawn to Julie. When R eats Perry's brain he's able to see his memories and learn more about her. He quickly develops feelings for Julie and rescues her from the other zombies and takes her to an abandoned airplane at a nearby airport. There the two oddly get to know each other as R becomes more and more humanlike.The film has been praised and condemned for being the first zombie romance but it's not actually the first of it's kind. There's another zombie-romance-comedy film (a 25 minute short) on YouTube called 'REVENGE OF THE DEAD' (written, directed by and starring Tim Hellman) and it's a much better film. The movie has also been compared to 'TWILIGHT' for taking another classic monster film genre and turning it into a sappy romance; involving a 'hot' young girl falling for a 'hot' young monster. The film is not nearly as bad as 'TWILIGHT' (it's not even in the same league)! It's much better acted, much more cleverly written and much better directed. That's not to say it doesn't have it's flaws. I don't like all of the liberties it takes with the genre and Malkovich and Corddry are wasted in the film (what's the point in casting Rob Corddry if he doesn't have any lines, he's only a genius comedian because of what he says and how he says it). Palmer is strikingly beautiful in the film and a nice tough heroine (much better than Kristen Stewart) and Hoult is decent as her zombie love interest (which is much more than anyone can say for Robert Pattinson or Taylor Lautner). The movie isn't a great zombie film but it's a nice change (for the most part).Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fP2Kjuc4BQY",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Romance"

It is like Twilight but you know it is good.,"The naughts saw a whole slew of zombie films released-such titles as 28 Days Later and Land of the Dead. Eventually, you started to get more off-beat comedic offerings-i.e. Shaun of the Dead. For my money Warm Bodies, an utterly delightful romantic comedy, is the best thing to come out of this trend. The film does ever you expect a Zombie love story to do. And it does it all so well. The movie is sensuous, scary and above all funny. Its inventions within the zombie form-why the zombies eat brains here is quite clever as a plot device, thematic point, and as genre revision-are all clever. This film is so lovable as a zombie film. It is loveable as teenage angst. It is lovable as romantic comedy.Much of the film rests on Hoult's star turn. With very few lines of dialog, he captures the audience's heart and runs away with it. He is perfect for the role of R and the character ends up being a iconic teenage heartthrob. He is absolutely hysterical when he needs to be. And he makes an utterly distinct believable character all within the Zombie persona. Probably the most endearing moment of the film is when R takes a moment to get into the practice of walking human. Palmer is no slouch and her Julie completes the R(omeo) and Juliet of the star-crossed lovers.Levine directs and writes with relish. He manages to sprinkle in just enough genre gore to make this a proper zombie film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Romance"
Chappy Watched: Warm Bodies,"So I'll start off by saying that this film does have Twilight themes to it but is 1000 times better and manages to tell a better film in one movie as opposed to four.The film starts straight away; there is no dwelling on how it all happened or even how far into the world it reaches.If you are expecting a Walking Dead, Dawn Of The Dead or Resident Evil level of zombie, flesh, blood and violence then you are going to be disappointed. This is a different take on zombies; they still eat flesh but it's a lot more toned down than any of the previously mentioned titles.The film is narrated by 'R', as he spends his days hanging around an abandoned airport, on the outside he is sluggish and struggles to even get one word out but he seems intellectually capable and aware in his mind. I did find it weird that these zombies are more functional than most, having the ability to open door and play records.It's also different to see that when the zombies eat a person's brain, they get their memories, feeling and emotions and there are also two types of zombies; the more human ones that can evolve or the 'bonies' that gave up on life and just become an empty shell.It has a really good cast with most of the focus on Nicholas Hoult, Teresa Palmer and Rob Corddry but with Dave Franco, John Malkovich and Analeigh Tipton rounding out a good group of actors.The soundtrack is also worth a mention with songs by Bob Dylan, Bruce Springstein, Roy Orbison, Guns N' Roses and Bon Iver.An enjoyable movie that should at least be watched once but I wouldn't be against watching it again.",5.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Romance"
Excellent twist on a zombie flick.,"I'm not sure why this is described as a comedy! Yes, there is pretty of humour but that's just a bonus to the strong drama in this near apocalyptic tale.It's a story of love and hope for humankind.Superb acting from the cast with exceptionally strong performances from Nicholas Hoult and Teresa Palmer. I've been a fan of Mr Hoult ever since his early performances in the TV serial Skins. I almost feel as if he is a friend of mine.I really can't fault this movie. Not quite a tear jerker but it certainly causes an emotional response. I was absolutely glued from start to finish. I would definitely recommend watching it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Romance"
remember Twilight?,"I already had mixed emotions when I see the add saying it was also a romance. That brought in mind immediately the Twilight series. A thing that just wasn't out for me being a horror buff. Sadly I had the same emotions while watching it, not only that, it's also slow so the remote control was in my hands to stop this flick which I finally didn't do due the name John Malkovich, but he also couldn't save this flick. he's doing what he has to do and that's playing the pain in the *ss, what he does best.It started okay and I had a bit of a smile on my face when R, the zombie, is telling about his life and it even had a few funny situations like walking to town where R stated, God it will take a while like we are walking. But from there on the romance comes in. Still R stays a zombie but towards the end it's just some Twilight or Romeo and Juliet situation that it really is out there for teenagers.I don't think that any zombie buff will like this very much. Yes there are head shots but for a zombie flick it doesn't have any gore or blood. The CGI used looked nicely done in the beginning and it didn't mind me at all but it was really the story that makes it not watchable for me.

Odd progress of caring and love,"I have heard about dozens of zombie movies, but I am not eager to watch them as I prefer evil being purposeful, not doing harm involuntarily or for plain survival. But I heard lots of good words concerning Warm Bodies and I watched it today... Well, better than expected. Although the plot is not smooth and has some logical caps, the presence of diverse zombies, inclusion of boneys, use of varied music, and some fine acting (particularly Nicholas Hoult as R - Hoult should obtain more praise for this role - and John Malkovich as Colonel Grigio - well, Malkovich is always pleasant to follow). The idea beyond is nice as well, the ending is expected, but warmhearted; a twist could have been included, however.All in all, the 1,5 hours pass without blah! feelings, and Hoult's facial appearance and expressions are something not to be missed.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Romance"
"A little too sweet, but there's a lot to like.","As a guy, sometimes this movie would really work for me. The cast is great from top to bottom. Rob Corddry was perfect. Analeigh Tipton never wastes a minute on screen. I've never seen Teresa Palmer before, but I'll be looking out for whatever she's in next. And Nicolas Hoult keeps showing me range I didn't know he had.But at times they just pushed too hard for that sort of...fairytale...hakuna matata...""the world is made of roses"" vibe. They'd show some really interesting, quirky ideas of life in a zombie outbreak, but then they'd get really sitcom-y when things should've gotten a little more serious. And a lot of it just felt too written. Like they didn't earn something that happened, a writer just decided it's time to happen now.R talked too much, too soon. Soldiers dropped their weapons too quickly. Everything just got accepted so quick. It felt like everyone was just playing their part to help these two's love story, instead of being real characters that act in any way that makes sense.It's a great idea. There are some really nice moments. And even when it gets dumb, it doesn't get as dumb as a lot of summer blockbusters can get. And it makes sense for the story it's telling. It just kinda disrespects zombie movies a lot. And doesn't find the balance between fear and love like it wants to. And kinda wastes a really really great premise, taking shortcuts to help make these two's world-changing love work.It's kind of a testament to Teresa Palmer and Nicolas Hoult that the movie stays together and still pulls you in. They make odd leaps and choices at weird or off times. The problem is, this movie really respects the love story it's telling a hell of a lot more than the world they built around it.But I still liked it.Like a lot of people, I'm a sucker for zombies. And I think guys and girls who are just happy to see a prettier Kristen Stewart who can act and Tony from Skins doing a really good job will like this. And zombie fans who don't care too much about the details or scares and have been itching for Zombieland 2 will like it as well.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Romance"

"A Romantic Comedy, with Zombies","When the trailer for Warm Bodies it was mocked for looking like Twilight with zombies. Fortunately the film does live not up to that as distinction as a zombie, R (Nicholas Hoult) starts to find his humanity after falling for a young woman, Julie (Teresa Palmer) and their relationship could end up being the key to a care for the zombie outbreak.Most of the comedy in Warm Bodies is frontloaded to the first third of the film, using Hoult's voice-over and physical actions and seeing how the zombies continue rambling about in a deserted airport. He has the best lines as he talks about R's existence and attempts woo Julie with his thoughts of don't be creepy - a little like the thought processes Mark Corrigan in Peep Show.Warm Bodies was adapted and directed by Jonathan Levine who is at making comedy-dramas and he did a solid job with Warm Bodies. Despite the zombie apocalypse being in full flow Warm Bodies was a mostly light hearted as the relationship budding between R and Julie. However when there was action in the third act it was very small scale and the limited budget was obvious.Warm Bodies was a decent offering and worked best as a new twist on zombie genre by looking at zombies themselves, giving them personalities and desires.

Rom-com spin on zombie flicks that isn't just satisfied with how clever that idea is,"The zombie genre has gone the way of vampires lately, except that it managed to dodge the romance bits — until now. Yes, it's even possible for the undead to fall in love, though considerably more difficult. ""Warm Bodies"" introduces the zombie romantic comedy (yes, zom-rom-com), and despite all the ways that in name alone it sounds as though the film could fail, it manages to carve its own niche among zombie pop-culture.Luckily for us, Jonathan Levine adapts and directs this Isaac Marion novel. The director of ""50/50"" and ""The Wackness"" has yet to disappoint, and though the premise of ""Warm Bodies"" brings him dangerously close, his grasp on romance and making young love work on the screen serves him well yet again.Levine's talents aside, ""Warm Bodies"" is a premise-driven film, which has its pros and cons. Other filmmakers could've executed it in ways that would've yielded countless movie reviews featuring the word ""cold"" in the headline, but a zombie who struggles with being emotionally dead inside and having to prey on human brains has its inherent merits. Conceptually, it takes on a certain life of its own that Levine mostly capitalizes on whenever possible.The film begins in our main character's (Nicholas Hoult) head as he copes with being a meandering, flesh-craving zombie and dreams (even though the dead can't dream in the literal sense) about getting something more out of this paltry existence. The film widens in scope with each passing scene, and though it never gets any better than it is when it's more intimate, it doesn't go so far off the rails in the finale that it loses sight of the charm that got us to pay attention up to that point.Everything changes for R (that's all he can remember of his first name) when he and a band of hungry corpses encounter some of the survivors from whatever outbreak caused everyone to become zombies eight years ago. A young woman (Teresa Palmer) catches his eye, and he unknowingly devours the brains of her boyfriend (Dave Franco), thereby receiving his memories of the girl, named Julie. R instantly becomes protective of Julie and helps her escape to his personal jet (an airplane stranded on a runway that R calls home).R convinces Julie she is only safe if she stays with him, deceiving her for companionship purposes. They bond in a number of ways as R's use of language drastically begins to improve. It's clear he's becoming more and more human with time.Hoult and Palmer have the difficult task of creating chemistry between their characters, which had to have been one of Levine's biggest challenges making this film. Presumably, Julie would be grossed out by her undead protector, but she senses his humanity rather quickly. To slow things down from there, however, she tries to ditch him at first. If her romantic interest had grown too quickly, it would've trashed the entire film. Given his track record, Levine should get a lot of the credit for allowing the audience time to warm up to their relationship.Palmer has been in a number of young-adult geared action films (""The Sorcerer's Apprentice,"" ""I Am Number Four"") but her performances have been either overshadowed or crushed by these giant turd blockbusters. ""Warm Bodies"" is a better fit with its indie sensibilities. She makes Julie's combination of fear, curiosity and love come together into a smoother blend than you'd expect from this kind of film.Hoult, on the other hand, has to find a perfect balance between zombie caricature and a thinking, emotional person. The narration crucially helps us connect with him, otherwise we'd never get to know him as a character, but he finds a way in the more traditional scenes when he interacts with Julie to express those feelings with grunts and slow-forming words. Think of all the cheesy monster movies when the ""thing"" expresses his feelings out loud for the first time. Just the mere thought of that has my eyes rolling, but Hoult keeps them firmly interested in what's going on.The story falters a bit toward the end because its trajectory is so apparent. R is becoming more alive, so he'll either become ""a real boy"" again or get killed before it happens, perhaps even by Julie's cold father, the leader of the survivors (John Malkovich). Suddenly we have a war of ideologies between Julie and those that believe zombies have the capacity to change and become more human and those who think they're nothing but animals who'll snack on your insides the second you let your guard down. It's a pretty classic motif, but you probably never figured someone would apply it to a zombie movie.Some unidentifiable spark between R and Julie, or perhaps between Hoult and Palmer, sticks through to the end of the film, even in the more action-oriented finale. ""Warm Bodies"" also doesn't ever lose its sense of humor, helping talk us down from taking it too seriously. And even though characters such as the best friend (Analeigh Tipton) appear to serve only comic relief, it doesn't try too hard for the awkward zombie joke.""Warm Bodies"" twists things up with this unusual genre riff and Levine subdues it rather than ramming its uniqueness down our throats. He makes it foremost about two people who seem like an odd fit that come to love each other — and that's really the essence of the better romantic comedies of all time.~Steven CThanks for reading!

A Zom-Rom-Com Do we really need those?,"I don't like zombie comedies, and I especially don't like zombie comedies in which the zombies can think, feel, talk or – god forbid – slowly transform back into human beings again! I often wonder how far nowadays directors can and will go exploiting the concept of zombie comedies even further. The days of George A. Romero's original zombie trilogy are long over and nail-biting suspense has gradually turned into absurd comedy and annoyingly ambitious story lines. The majority of zombie comedies are pretty lame, with some notable exceptions of movies that accomplished something particularly refreshing or innovative, like for example ""Shaun of the Dead"", ""Fido"" and ""Wasting Away"". ""Warm Bodies"" is definitely also one of the more watchable zombie comedies out there, but this is merely thanks to the solid directing of Jonathan Levine and the excellent performances of Nicolas Hoult and Theresa Palmer, rather than to the dire and derivative subject matter. Following a not specifically mentioned type of catastrophe, 99% of the world's population turned into zombies while the last remaining human survivors entrench themselves in a fortress and listen to the orders of John Malkovich. But the shuffling zombies here are quite different than the usual type of braindead monsters, as they somehow still have remnants of emotions and intelligence left in them. The young R – he can't remember the rest of his name – lives at an airport where he cozily decorated his own private plane and he manages to contemplate about his life (or, better yet, his death) and even produce a few words. During one of his quests for human brains to feed on, R falls head over heels for the tough chick Julie. He munches Julie's boyfriend's brains – and memories – but rescues her and bonds with her in his airplane. Problem remains, of course, that R is a corpse and Julie is the daughter of the leader of the human resistance fighters. ""Warm Bodies"" contains a handful of really good ideas and – it has to be said – R's monologues are extremely witty. It's hilarious to finally hear zombies say about themselves stuff like ""God, we move slow!"" After an enjoyable first half, the film becomes dull and ordinary. The sequences with the skeletons or ""Bonies"" (zombies in a final state of decay and completely devoid of emotions) are downright pathetic, because of the unfitting violent tone and the miserably bad CGI-effects. The fairy-tale climax is as soft and weak as you would expect from a zom-rom-com",4.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Romance"

Zombies need love too...,"I was rather hyped up about getting to see this movie, as I am a big fan of all things zombie, and the trailer did seem really interesting, and not to mention that I had the book way before this was ever turned into a movie. And now having seen it, I am somewhat sitting here with a little bit of a strange taste in my mouth.While the movie is great, yes, there was just something very superficial and shallow to it, as its storyline progressed without really delving into anything but just brushing over the surface of everything. There was just something profound missing from the movie to make it unique.I am not saying that the movie is bad, far from it, because it is rather entertaining to see the 'apocalypse' from the zombie's point of view, but truth be told, then this movie is meant for a lovestruck audience that have just gotten over their romantic sparkly vampire crush and seeking love from other members of the undead. Despite its sugar-coated, candy-sweet love-story, then the movie is enjoyable for a zombie aficionado as well.The zombies are nicely detailed, though there is a strange lack of missing limbs and decay here. You are either recently deceased or long-time deceased in this movie - zombie or bony. The bonies were rather unique though, lots of good details and decomposition here.The story itself, well yeah, it was meant for a teenage or young romantic audience, as it tended to get overly sugar-sweet and cliché-filled throughout the course of the movie.As for the cast, well people did good jobs with their given roles, and it was nice to see John Malkovich in a movie such as this.But in itself, then ""Warm Bodies"" is a great, albeit rather unusual type, addition to any zombie aficionado's zombie movie collection. This is essentially ""Twilight"", just with zombies. But as such, it is bearable, and also the lack of sparkly skin and big hair makes it all the more better.

Great Start,"The first half of this movie is actually EXCEPTIONAL, the second half is not as good, it was slightly above average.The first half was seriously creative and fresh, it was something new that you don't see often.

The second half got too big for it's britches, the writers took a wrong turn and tried to take on to large of a scale of a movie. The story turned from a concentrated sweet love story to; WE NEED TO SAVE THE WORLD THE BAD GUYS ARE COMING. A very noticeable and quick pivot in the story line. The movie took itself too seriously in the second half as well, which made it it a bit cheesy, less lighthearted and ""quirky"" (hate that word).

"A Romantic, Comedy, Drama, Horror Movie","3 February 2013. This rare blend of comedy and drama with a romance, horror genre is a difficult editing and scriptwriting challenge. To maintain the tone and balance is a juggling act where too much horror can easily destroy the comedy or too much comedy will make too light of the drama, or the romance can be easily lost as just a fluffy add on. In Warm Bodies, this uneasy mixture seems to have developed into a full flavored banquet that is emotive, meaningful, thrilling, and tender. As with The Devil Wears Prada (2006) and Electric Dreams (1984) the melodic music is well adapted to this movie and in a few places actually carries the movie itself. This is a predictable romantic comedy with strong dramatic elements with the zombie horror action thrills presented with a great comedic voice-over. Unlike Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet or West Side Story (1961), this movie comes at a time in American history where the Great Recession appears to be over and besides global warming and international alarm, our Country is more hopeful in its outlook while facing an emerging Hispanic population and the movie's tone appears to embrace similar challenges that we face today. Unlike Escape from New York (1981) where the President's plane crashes behind the towering walls surrounding Manhattan that has been turned into a national prison, the walls that have been built up in America will need to torn down, a message that seems to underlie the larger framework of Warm Bodies, along with the magical power of love.Warm Bodies appears to build on the comedy-drama of All About Steve (2009) with flashes of the comedy flare of Ghost Town (2008). At the same time, this movie also incorporates the more biting drama-comedy as found in Terry Gilliam's The Fisher King (1991). The same way that The Demolition Man (1993) brought together elements of comedy into science fiction action genre or Tropic Thunder (2008) set in a comedy set in a deadly serious Asian war arena where the characters believe its all a movie set, is where each of these genre necessarily brushed up with sharp rough edges, Warm Bodies was necessarily cut where horror scenes would sour the lighter comedy elements, where the transitional scenes between comedy and drama and action threatened to become boringly slow was filled with impending, hauntingly beautiful music to carry the mood through to the next scene.Warm Bodies even takes is underlying romantic theme from Roman Holiday (1953) where a sheltered princess is exposed to the love experience with an American newsman in Rome. Romantic flashes of Total Recall (1990), Dances with Wolves (1990), even the classic sci fi The Day The Earth Stood Still (1951) or Blade Runner (1982) reverberate throughout this movie.It's difficult to assess whether the awkward newness of this fusion of genres, the unsettling mixture, the at times slow pacing, it's seeming predictability are a product of a weakness of this movie or whether its boldly forging ahead with these momentous changes in movie plot developing incorporating major distinctively different genres are reflection more of a brilliance is hard to say.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Romance"
A movie about zombie falling in love with a girl.so is this a another Twilight?,"A movie about zombie falling in love with a girl.so is this a another Twilight? No. The basic premise is about that world where there are a lot of zombies,there is a zombie called R and we are introduced to the world through his voice. He's an introspective zombie who thinks and if you are puritan who don't like there mythical creatures to be messed with,then probably it is not for you. Good thing is the makers knows the plot and have comic elements in the movie and don't push our down throat as serious drama with Bland characters giving cheesy dialogues throughout the film. The lead Characters is nice and acting is well done,and i think you can buy into the whole love story of these characters and R is very much likable dude. Around 90 minutes of length ,it is not boring , Apart from love story there is added storyline of Bonies who you can call as alpha zombies who are the villains,adding to that supporting Characters specially of another zombie M is Cool,the zombies feeling warm again and some good background songs this makes up for an fun time watch.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Romance"
Likable feel good quirky romance,"This Zombie - human romance comedy works and is worth a watch.Nicholas Hoult looks better as a Zombie because his features are a bit crooked especially the mouth. The whole get up actually suits him. His role could have been a bit idiotic but he pulls it off quite well. Teresa Palmer looks just like a blond Kristen Stewart. She acts well and is cute. Supporting cast is good including John Malkovich, Analeigh Tipton and Dave Franco.Liked the tongue in cheek vein of dark humor that runs through the movie. It doesn't take itself too seriously. There are some moments of laugh out loud humor but not quite enough.The story is quite satisfying and feel good that's why it was a hit.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Romance"
Undead on Arrival...that's my clever way of say it sucked.,"Warm Bodies is one of the worst films I have ever seen. I was praying for a zombie to jump out of the screen and eat my eyes, but that would be way too graphic for a shamefully hindering PG-13 rating. I could barely get past the opening credits before I started to wish I was dead. Ironically enough, the script was so excruciatingly awful that after my brother and I made it about 10 minutes in, it started to hurt our braaaaaaaaaaaaaains! All kidding aside, because I don't want this review to come off as cutesy and nauseatingly candy-ass as Warm Bodies itself, one has to wonder if this entire god awful production/crap-fest was completely funded in secrecy by Hot Topic in a desperate attempt to sell more hoodies. It is one thing for a movie to be stupid, but when it is pretentious to boot, I just can't stomach garbage of that magnitude and in this regard, Warm Bodies is by far the greatest offender of all. In all seriousness, the synopsis/tag-line to this film should just be ""zombies are like so adorable."" I mean chances are that was the pitch the director gave to the studio. Hell, I wouldn't be surprised if that was the screenplay as well. George A. Romero's poops should have more credibility in the realm of Zombie cinema than this debacle. It could have been a Disney film, but there wasn't enough blood. Never mind that it was so boring, predictable, wrote, and hackney that I was doing more moaning and groaning than the freaking zombies as I struggled to watch it. If there is one positive thing that can be said about Warm Bodies, assuming you take it out of context, I guess it would be that watching it truly is a zombifying experience.P.S. Shame on you, John Malkovich!",1.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Romance"
Not Bad,"All in all this movie was entertaining. It wasn't that long and didn't have me checking my watch every 5 minutes. That being said it also didn't have me on the edge of my seat. The humor, i felt , was a letdown. This was one of those movies where 90% of the funny parts were in the trailers. Don't get me wrong, i liked the movie but its definitely not Oscar worthy. Its not very scary, its not too lovey-dovey but if also not extremely funny. You'll laugh but not a full belly laugh, more of a chuckle. Definitely not a ""must see"" but if you're looking for away to spend an hour and a half this will do just fine.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Romance"
"Unique, but didn't Take my Breath away,","Warm Bodies is a decent movie with a well developed storyline and a good cast. It is a very unique film, set in a completely different universe from our own, zombies may be a very overused device in film and television these days, but in this movies defense, it uses them in a very different way, giving us sympathy for them instead of simply wanting them all dead. I know a lot of people like this movie, but it didn't really win me over, the romance was the strongest part of the story, but I really didn't find Nicholas Hoult and Teresa Palmer believable, they didn't have a lot of chemistry and once Hoult's character became able to speak properly, their unconditional love became even less believable. I felt like it tried too hard to be several different genres, it wanted to be a comedy, with a lot of romance, a fair amount of horror and even a little action, I think it should have stuck with romantic comedy without so many scenes that were meant to be scary and intense, R and Julie's relationship could have been much more effective without these scenes. It's definitely not a brutal film, but Warm Bodies has too many flaws that left me feeling underwhelmed by a movie I thought had a lot of potential, and because of that I couldn't recommend it.Set during a zombie apocalypse, a girl begins to fall in love with a zombie with human traits, despite her father planning to annihilate them all.Best Performance: Nicholas Hoult",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Romance"

👍,"""Warm Bodies"" (2013) is a unique romantic zombie comedy that offers a fresh take on the familiar tropes of the genre. The film centers around R, a young zombie struggling to cope with the monotony of his undead existence. When he encounters Julie, a human survivor, he experiences a surprising emotional connection, a spark of humanity that begins to reanimate his decaying body.The film cleverly subverts expectations by portraying zombies not as mindless monsters, but as emotionally stunted individuals yearning for connection. R's journey of rediscovering empathy and love is both heartwarming and thought-provoking. The film explores themes of loneliness, loss, and the power of human connection to overcome even the most profound isolation.""Warm Bodies"" is a visually appealing film with a distinctive style that blends humor, romance, and horror. The performances are strong, particularly from Nicholas Hoult as R and Teresa Palmer as Julie. The film's unique take on the zombie genre and its exploration of deeper themes make it a memorable and engaging experience.While some may find the film's tone uneven at times, ""Warm Bodies"" is a charming and surprisingly touching love story that offers a unique perspective on the undead and the human condition.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Romance"
Sexist role-perpetuating rubbish...,"While some writers/editors/producers of movies where there's an opportunity to detach from one-can-always-depend-upon-family 'values', do detach, and do things like balance the abilities of the female as well as male characters in violent settings,.. others go with pitiful she-can-speak-for-herself-BUT- limits ... where the female is still in effect a traditionally-screaming-child/helpless-maiden sort of thing, where they're either a daughter, a gf, a wife, or similar, where also of all the main/secondary characters there is ALSO no female with power in-amongst side plots, amongst relationships, group identities, etc... and there is a distinct AVOIDANCE, of who has power to change events, in the plot development.This movie might not be as bad as they come, but it's pretty bad - expect to feel patronized-against and offended after watching all of it, if not also disappointed in terms of the undead genre - but of course if having expected that in the druggie-as-a-zombie portrayal/film-exploit then you'd've expected that ... but to few amongst few male-partner-of-a-m/f-couple-watchers who like the undead-genre but are dissapointed when yet-another undead-genre movie she's chosen, turns out to be be another drug-user-metaphore lecture,.. would NOT-find, this patronizing/sexist, with of course, the daughter of the protective father, 'deserving' nothing but YOUR personal change ... don't think about yourself ...

This steaming pile-of bleep ... by comparison, will treat you like roadkill, and the producers of it, will not care less about the INdiscriminations, or failures of differentiation, that 'daughters' as of it's intended market audience,.. will then be more likely to inflict upon you.",3.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Romance"
A good usage of fusion between two very derivative narratives,"This movie does two things; 1. show a zombie-apocalypse from a new perspective, and 2. everything it can with something that is not new or super high-concept.Fantastically displays how zombies feel and how socially anxious they would be. It is amazing how it manages to portray such a relatable zombie.This is a typical love story so it does have some tropes here and there, like the ""come sleep in the same bed as me scene"", but the fact that it merges two very derivative narratives provides freshness in both spaces, so the movie earns those tropes.It also sort of plays like a Disney fairy-tale. You've got transformation/curse, unlikely romance and even a disapproving father.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Romance"
So you got some sleep,"The film leaves a mixed impression. On one hand, it seems naïve, filled with plot inconsistencies and at times outright absurd moments. On the other hand, it exudes sincerity, kindness, and features several standout qualities that make it hard to overlook. Let me share my subjective opinion on Jonathan Levine's work.Pros:
1. Nicholas Hoult (R). His portrayal of a walking corpse deserves applause. The shuffling gait, expressive facial expressions, and measured speech make the character feel alive (in a way) and touching. Even in the role of a zombie, he manages to look appealing, and his relationship with Julie is full of humanity, care, and endearing awkwardness. Particularly impressive is R's inner conflict and his yearning to regain a human life.2. Supporting characters. Nora and M. Nora is charming during R's visit to Julie's house, while M consistently brings a smile throughout the film. The umbrella scene in the finale is especially amusing.3. Music. The soundtrack by Marco Beltrami and Buck Sanders beautifully complements the film's atmosphere. The selection of songs is delightful, particularly M83's ""Midnight City,"" which plays during R's transformation. This moment stands out as a highlight thanks to the perfect blend of music and visuals.4. Humor. Witty and occasionally touching lines from R add a sense of lightness to the film, making it more memorable.Cons:
1. Teresa Palmer (Julie). Her performance feels monotonous, and her emotions seem shallow. However, there are exceptions: the airplane scenes with R and the water finale. One particularly memorable moment is when Julie plays a record and starts dancing - she truly shines in that scene. However, the character herself feels implausible. After losing her boyfriend, she's happily enjoying life the next day, and when R reveals the details of his death, her reaction is cold and detached. This stark contrast between her forced toughness and lack of genuine emotion is jarring.2. John Malkovich. His acting, as in most of his films, feels repetitive. The role of Julie's father adds nothing new to his repertoire.3. Plot inconsistencies. Why does R know how to use an iPod? How does he charge it? How does a decaying zombie suddenly have a beating heart and circulating blood? These moments undermine even the fairytale logic the film tries to maintain.4. Pacing. Some scenes feel unnecessary and slow down the narrative, which dampens the overall impression.Conclusion:
This film is worth watching at least for Nicholas Hoult's performance and the fantastic music, which will undoubtedly enhance any playlist. Despite its flaws, the movie contains philosophical depth, kindness, and an unpretentious attempt to tell an unusual love story. It's not perfect but will undoubtedly find its audience.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Romance"
a zombie movie with a crazy plot,"This is the craziest zombie movie of them all. First just forget everything you think you know about zombies because this movie throws all that out the door. R is a zombie that can think and he eats the brains of Julie's boyfriend, hence getting all his memories, that's one of the new zombie twist. So when R has a chance to attack Julie, he recognizes her and begins talking and gets her to safety. How is this possible? Well it seems the zombies are coming back to life, of course this is never explained. They are the walking dead, but come back to life, really far fetched. Of course, Julie's dad doesn't understand the blossoming love between her and R, but it's easy for her friend to accept. And the bad guys in this are the bonies. Zombies that have ripped all their flesh off and look like skeletons.FINAL VERDICT: This movie makes up a lot of new rules about zombies. The plot is too much to take, skip it.",4.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Romance"
Juliet and Zombie Romeo,"Nicholas Hoult plays R, a zombie who cannot remember his full name. He shuffles around an airport with dry, witty narration filling his thoughts. M (Rob Corddry) is his best friend, and sometimes they get hungry and team up to go look for brains. During one of these meals out, R eats the brains of Perry (Dave Franco), and R finds Perry's feelings for his girlfriend Julie (Teresa Palmer) becoming his own. R then saves Julie and hides her in his Wall-E like shelter full of the remains of human society.Director Jonathan Levine made the indie coming-of-age film The Wackness, which was reasonably entertaining if not very original. His follow-up feature was the terrific 50/50, which was a great convergence of actors and script. Warm Bodies ends up somewhere between the two. The highlight of the film in terms of both actor and script is Nicholas Hoult. His depressed narration includes most of the best lines and Hoult manages to get across a lot of emotion despite sticking to the grey, dead features of the classic Hollywood zombie.The supporting cast fits the film, but no one is trying too hard to make Warm Bodies a very serious film, which for a Rom-Zom-Com is the best choice. Rob Corddry just plays himself, Teresa Palmer is a beautiful and relatable lead, and John Malkovich agreed to be in this movie, which is less impressive now that his recent work has included Transformers: Dark of the Moon and Jonah Hex.As for the story itself, if R and Julie wasn't enough of a hint, Perry sounds like Paris, R's best friend is M, and Julie's best friend wants to be a nurse. The star-crossed connections become painfully clear when R approaches Julie at her balcony. And this is the main flaw of the film. Director Jonathan Levine keeps the focus on the Shakespeare romance instead of on the zombie comedy. This is only a problem because it places the audience in the awkward position of rooting for necrophilia, an obstacle that even the most dedicated romantic would have trouble overcoming.Warm Bodies is an entertaining riff on Shakespeare that seems very original at the start, but soon reveals its conventional side. It's not gory enough to be a zombie classic, but it's good enough to be a worthwhile (unconventional) romance.http://charlieposts.blogspot.ca/2013/02/warm-bodies.html",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Romance"

Zombie awakening,"To keep it short:I love this movie. The reference to our zombie-like society makes this comedy deeper than you'd like to think at first. The soundtrack is great. The plot is simple, but it's touching. It makes me think about whether or not we can change, as human beings. I have lived a zombie-like life myself, and I don't think I am the only one. Losing contact with my body, my feelings. So to me, this movie is about Waking Up, and it serves a much greater purpose. So goddamn good it's a funny and somewhat ironic movie as well.

A quite different zombie movie. Not bad.,"This is a quite different zombie movie. I think it can best be described as a romantic zombie movie with a humorous touch and some action thrown in for good measure. It is not at all a bad movie. I do prefer the ""shot everything that moves and when it doesn't move anymore shot some more just to be sure"" type of zombie movies but I still quite enjoyed this one. The words ""romantic"" and ""zombie"" is of course two words that you really would never expect to see in the same sentence. Surprisingly enough it does indeed work in this movie.I think my main enjoyment of this movie was the voice-over with R's thoughts though. At times it is incredibly funny. The actual story, that the zombies' magically starts to heal themselves is of course pretty nonsensical but you do not really watch zombie movies for their elaborate plot anyway. I have seen worse and this was not really supposed to be a horror-zombie movie anyway so I can live with that.This is the first zombie-movie that I have watched where you actually see the story from the zombies perspective. Another thing that, surprisingly enough, worked quite well. The voice-overs helped a lot to make that happen.The special effects are fairly low key for being a zombie movie but I would say that they are just about right for this movie. The ""bonies"" are the most monster-like ones in the movie and their make-up is quite cool. Unfortunately their movements are quite stiff and look decidedly computer generated. That is a shame and pretty much the only complaint I have concerning the actual implementation of this movie.Unless you are totally allergic to zombies I would recommend watching this movie. I would especially recommend it if you are not normally into zombie movies. You are likely to be surprised.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Romance"
George Romaro Is Rolling In His Grave Right now.,"I was wrong about Thor: The Dark World being the worst film of the year. At least it was credible. This movie on the other hand, is the biggest travesty since Iron Sky. A Insult to the zombie genre itself by insulting fans of the zombie genre in this poorly acted, abysmally written movie.I didn't even finish watching this film and I know its the worst film of the year. Its so bad it makes Twilight look like a better love story than anything.The film is about a Zombie played by the very gifted actor Nicolas Hoult. Unfortunately, this model/actor has to work with such bad material. This Zombie named R has more problems in life than a Disney Princess. He wishes he was Human and how he wants to be free. This is unbelievably stupid.But not until he meets a human named Julie. Then he falls in love with her. He takes him back to the airport where she is creep-ed out by him but... *Sigh* she begins to like him. So the movie is basically about him narrating every five minutes about his stupid life.The movie's most insulting scenes are ones where R is getting healed. The things that most offended me was that he eats people because ""IT MAKES HIM FEEL HUMAN"" BS! Zombies cannot feel human! They cannot breathe! Also, He Can Dream. WHAT THE ACTUAL F#@$!? HE DREAMS!? Who wrote this crap? OH WAIT. LEVINE HIMSELF.Not only is that the worst of it, but the zombies can also talk. OK. Zombies don't talk. Even if they did, would they sound like depressed Goths? The acting is horrendous. The girl who plays Julie has about as much emotion as Bella Swan. This movie is a poor mans version of Twilight.The music is incredibly misplaced with 80's pop songs that sound like they should be in a real romantic comedy than a film about zombies. Even though some of the songs are OK, the score is a stupid dumb tech-no soundtrack that should be placed in a film like Tron: Legacy.This also is a stupid Romeo and Juliet Post Apocalypse film which I hadn't noticed until I saw a balcony where Julie is looking into the sky.This is a disgrace to movies. Its a disgrace to filmmaking. Its a disgrace to writing, its a disgrace in every sense of the meaning. Warm Bodies is the worst film of 2013. A clumsily written, horribly acted, and awfully directed film from the man who brought us a movie called 50/50 which I haven't seen but I know it should be good.I feel sorry to all the 13 year old girls who like this movie. They obviously haven't developed taste yet.8/100 F",1.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Romance"
"Best zombie comedy since ""Shaun of the Dead""","Obviously intent on drawing Twilight crowds, director Jonathan Levine brilliantly redefines a genre laden with history mixing the expected romantic twist to the tale with the unexpected hilarity of subverting teenage drama into a zom-com. In a not-so-distant future the world has been overcome by zombies with the last outposts of the living in heavily guarded fortresses. Meanwhile the dead walk the Earth, pointlessly and repeatedly wandering along oft-tread paths, mechanically searching for live brain. Those zombies, who have entirely detached from their humanity (given up the vestiges of hope), have turned into soulless remnants called 'bonies', entirely ravaged by the virus - now faster and consumed by an overwhelming blood lust.The rest, like R (blue-eyed Nicholas Hoult) still hang on to some past memory of being human, eating brains a way to re-immerse into the living (brain-eating causes the zombie to steal other peoples memories), whilst spending the multitude of spare time collecting vinyls and having quasi-conversations with fellow undead M (Rob Corddry). When Julie (Teresa Palmer), daughter of general Grigio (John Malkovich), falls into a zombie trap, R (after prior munching through the skull of her fiancée) creates an unusual affinity to the girl, thus causing him to spare her life. This soon brings about a spiral of events, which surprisingly causes R to slowly uncover the ability to speak or to harbour feelings.Levine obviously was inspired by the vampire craze initiated by the Twilight series, audaciously deciding to take Teresa Palmer as the female protagonist. Due to significant facial similarities coupled with a dose of mimicry Palmer could well claim to be a sister of Kristen Stewart. But ""Warm Bodies"" uses these similarities to introduce a new take on the zombie genre, while bringing in new crowds in on the fun. Bound to cause some confusion amongst Meyers fan-base as to what exactly this movie is, Levine isn't however really interested in making fun of ""Twilight"" (although certain nods can be easily distinguished). Instead he quickly finds his own pace and style within this illogical romantic scenario of a dilapidated corpse falling madly in love with a live girl. Masterfully balancing the more sincere, dramatic moments with an onslaught of well timed, brilliantly thought out comedy, the movie succeeds in throes, delivering one of the freshest pictures of the season. Much praise must be given to the obviously restrained Nicholas Hoult, who mostly communicates with 'ughs' and 'ers', throwing the occasional crooked smile, while delivering the comedic underpinning with a wry narration of his thoughts.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Romance"
A worthy entry to the Zombie sub-genre,"Before writing the main part of this review, lets deal with something else first. There seems to be a lot of talk about Twilight series surrounding this film. The hatred for that series has become so intense – almost militant – that it is seeping into completely unconnected projects. Don't get me wrong, I am most definitely not a fan of those films, but they and Warm Bodies have about as much in common as The Whole Nine Yards and Godfather.Warm Bodies is a fresh, if not completely original, addition to the Zombie genre. Shaun of the Dead and Zombieland have recently started to bring this horror sub genre to the masses by upping the laughs and limiting the gore; Warm Bodies takes it a step further by adding a much stronger romance sub plot (actually, it could be argued that the zombie apocalypse is the sub-plot here with the romance being the central plot). The film is not without its scares though. The zombies are self aware and for the most part, are not happy with their condition. Those that essentially give in to what they are gradually turn to ""bonies"" – skeletal creatures who are much quicker and more aggressive. Whilst for the veteran zombie fan, these will cause little more than a flutter, for the casual observer they are enough to give the movie an edge. There is also an excellent soundtrack full of classic songs.There are a few questionable character decisions and bending of its own rules, which are used to take the action to its required destination. John Malkovich is also criminally underused for an actor of his ability and seemingly perfect fit in the role of chief zombie hater. Other than that though, this is a thoroughly enjoyable film with a decent, at times witty, script. There's even an early moment that suggests the film is going to tread in Romero's steps and be a social satire too. Unfortunately that never came to be though and ultimately that prevented this film entering the realm of brilliant.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Romance"
"In a post apocalyptic world, a zombie falls in love with a human","Maybe I'm cynical. Maybe I'm just cold. Either way this movie sucked the life out of me.The movie stars ""R"", a Zombie (played by Nicholas Hoult) who displays affection for Julie, (played by Teresa Palmer) a human girl whom he captured in a search for food. The more he falls for this girl the more human traits he begins to develop until he himself becomes human.The concept of the movie itself is actually pretty interesting and kept me engaged just enough to see it to the end. With that being said, only clocking in at about an hour and a half, this was probably one of the LONGEST movies I have ever seen. Every scene could be predicted as soon as the plot reveals itself, and all of the characters portrayed are very 2-dimensional. What may have started as a interesting concept quickly becomes one of your usual ""boy meets girl plot-lines"" found in all romantic comedies. All characters beside R and Julie are only there to move the plot along and seem to have no lives or motives of their own. And every attempt at a comedic moment does nothing but register a pity laugh, because nearly all of the jokes fell flat.My biggest complaint about the movie is that Julie, the romantic interest, is the most helpless character in the entire film. Her inability to defend herself or her compliance to do whatever R tells her to do is beyond any rational mind. She was raised to hate zombies, her boyfriend was eaten by zombies, she has to scavenge for food and supplies because of zombies, yet she has the audacity to fall for a zombie after 3 days of capture. My head hurts from just thinking about it...All in all this movie is nothing but average. It reeks of a reused plot line, 2-dimensional characters, standard movie clichés, and a sub- par script. As I said before the concept could have made this a great movie, but it was executed so poorly that it solely exists for you to give it a chance.",4.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Romance"
Quality zombie entertainment,"Warm Bodies seems like something fresh and peculiar when compared to movies released nowadays. Sure some aspects are more than overdone by Hollywood on a regular basis. What makes this movie stand out among the others is the fact that it was carefully made and everything about it fell into place. Our lead character is someone that will get you off on the right foot with the story that is going to be told. He is funny, interrogative and sort of fits in with his kind, but seems to wanna break free. When he meets Julie, a human girl sent out to get supplies, he senses a need to protect her and therefore takes her home. From then on he will change as he spends time with her and begins to bond. This change will progress from R (the boy's name) to the other zombies, as they begin to feel and dream like they hadn't in years. Despite these good news, danger is present when the bonies (zombies reduced to deadly skeletons) become aware of what's happening and both the humans, led by Julie's father, and the evolving corpses face extinction. Not too long, the movie manages to entertain with competent acting that makes you root for the characters. The fine directing helps as well as it is quite compatible with the smart script, based on the novel. Warm Bodies is a good movie experience for people who not only appreciate this genre but also enjoy logical romances filled with thrills.Rating 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Romance"

Surprisngly heart warming movie,"This film definitely deserves a 9/10 review but as im only seeing this as 6.9 i feel like it deserves to be higher. So im hoping people will realise how good thos filn is to bring the average up. This film was brilliantly done for the script it had so dont read unless you want spoilers although ive kept them to a minimum. So if you have seen the film just think how stupid the original script must of sounded.
Basically zombies manage to invade the world and even take over every countries military with ease and have a group of survivors build a wall to protect themselves (maybe this is what trump is trying to prepare for). Then a group of teenagers who cant even shoot a gun straight, seriously when you watch this film dave franco had the perfect shot to take them out with a semi automatic but still f$&#s it up and gets himself killed. But in some weird sort off karma this then contributes to the survival of everything (dont want to say to much as it is spoilers).
But with both Nicholas Hoult and Teresa Palmer's acting and not to forget john Malkovich's co starring they manage to turn what sounds a stupid as s%#t film into something brilliant that just grabs your attention from the start and wont let go till the film ends.

Great Soundtrack,"The one thing I try not to be is a sucker for the romance movies. I am certainly not against them in any fashion but I find most to be very contrived and obvious that they are almost offensive. It is with that in mind that I avoid the much 'hyped' ones like the drinking water in Sochi. The ones I truly am interested in seeing, I do so with cloak and dagger tactics so no one recognize me entering or leaving. I'd probably be less embarrassed caught leaving a porn shop than caught leaving some big budget romance film. I do recall seeing previews for Warm Bodies and felt it was safe enough as a comedy / romance to brave the chance of embarrassment. This movie is about Zombies. In a time when Zombies are all the rage, someone found a way to make this a part of the rest. The movie centers around 'R', a zombie who provides us with his internal monologue. While he and his Zombie brethren are out feeding, he sees Julie and is immediately captivated by her. Instead of eating her brains, he protects her and takes her back to his 'sanctuary' (a home he has made on a plane parked at the airport). Julie discovers he is different and seems to be trying to communicate with her. They develop a bond and R begins to change, slowly regaining his speech and faculties. As Julie starts to notice this as well, the two embark to spread the word in hopes of curing all zombies. I know that synopsis sounds lame but I cant give too much away. There are some typical zombie feeding scenes and battle scenes between the undead and the living- so don't fret. At the end of the day, this is a wonderful movie about an unlikely pair reminding people what it is like to be 'human'. I still tear up at the end of this and regard it as my favorite Zombie romance movie.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Romance"
Warm Bodies,"Hoult is a zombie who falls in love with Palmer. Malkovich her father is the leader of the gun toting zombie slayers.Well handled, straightforward fun attempt to play with the zombie story which works pretty well. There are a few laughs as well as some tension. The 2 leads are solid and Malkovich is, well, Malkovich.",5.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Romance"
Warm Bodies - brief,"To paraphrase the oft moaned female lament, ""He couldn't keep it up."" Zombie film as told from a detached, wry, dryly humorous soul. Hmm, do zombies even have souls? Pointedly funny, satirical contrast of disconnected vs dead. Brilliant flash of the zombie recollection of ""happy"" disconnected humanity, lurching their ways, eyes glued to cellphones and similar devices. Thirty minutes on, love enters the narrative and the overall edge wilts. Movie turns romantic, then preachy. Rom com, at least in this movie, does not equate to razor honed satire. The story gets mushy. For zombie gourmands, very few unhappy meals.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Romance"
Clever Twist On Genre,"WARM BODIES marketing campaign probably hurt it cuz you couldn't tell if it was a romantic comedy WITh zombies or a zombie movie WITH comedy. But we finally watched it and I thought it was very clever and funny. Hoult & Palmer were terrific. The opening monologue was hilarious and immediately showed how funny sharing the inner thoughts of a zombie would be. LOVED that John Malkovich was the militaristic leader. Haven't liked most of the other films Jonathan Levine has made but this was very well done. Romeo & Juliet with a BITE! They satirized everything from makeover montages, sidekicks, zombie folklore, etc. And the music used throughout was GREAT! Bravo! Hoult has really grown up since being the little kid in ABOUT A BOY!",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Romance"

New Spin on Zombies,"At first glance this looks like a Twilight/Zombie flick but after watching it you start to think a our Undead friends in a new creative way. It's funny, nostalgic, and a great movie to watch with your friends!I enjoyed it from start to finish. Not the best acting but comical at that. The characters are developed nicely and they don't seem like strangers at the end of the movie.The music is pretty good too and everything seems to kind of fit together in a way that's not confusing and ill humored....Watch This...",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Romance"
Saved by the undead,"Wanted to see this film from the moment I saw the trailer at Christmas. I rarely give anything a perfect rating, however, this little gem deserves top marks. I am not a fan of the zombie genre but for the movies message to work, the hero really needs to be a member of the undead. The characters are intriguing and the story is heartwarming, literally! The take away message, or the parable if you will, is that in order to overcome being undead, you have to be human. It is all about relationships and communication, preferably face to face rather than being glued to your smart phone and tweeting your every thought or mundane activity to an electronic cosmos that literally is not a warm body. Will watch this one again and again and can't wait to get the book too!!!",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Romance"
Warm Bodies — Love with a Z as in teenage zombie romance,"Warm Bodies wants to be a new take on the zombie genre. I'll give them partial credit for the result.There's several unique elements about zombie life that really make this flick worth seeing. Its biggest novelty achievement is using a zombie apocalypse as a backdrop for a romance, and casting a zombie as one of the lover. That's definitively well done.However, this movie is fortunate to have a fresh spin, because there are many logical flaws in its scenario. More over, beyond the suspension of disbelief that comes with the concept of a zombie, you have to make an additional large concession for the healing process and how it comes about which is borderline cheesy.If you don't mind mixing teenage romance and zombies, it's nice entertainment.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Romance"
Twilight with zombies,"Yeah, WARM BODIES is a mess, and unlikely to thrill the viewer unless they're an American teenager, because this film is squarely aimed at the TWILIGHT market. In fact it's pretty much TWILIGHT with zombies instead of vampires, and it's a film that serves to thrust post-modern mindless slacker humour down the throat of the viewer at every opportunity. Needless to say that I hated every moment, and sitting through it was a chore indeed.The unlikeable Nicholas Hoult plays 'R', one of many zombies in a post-apocalyptic world, who inherits the memory and emotion of a random jock guy when he eats his brain. He ends up falling in love with the guy's girlfriend, a blonde bimbo type whose name I can't even recall. John Malkovich co-stars as the girl's tough dad and you feel sorry for him being mired in such an outing.The plot is essentially Romeo and Juliet, but with lots of laughs and undead jokes along the way. There's some supernatural stuff thrown in too, like a twist involving the whole zombie epidemic thing which I didn't much care for. Plus, with the zombies being good guys for once, there has to be a breed of super-zombie as the real villain, which is all nonsensical. Anyway I was never going to love this film as it's the sort of soft, mainstream nonsense I automatically hate; your mileage may vary.",2.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Romance"
"Inventive, original and funny!","We know, you are like totally over the whole 'zombie' thing. Well, Warm Bodies is not a zombie movie, so simmer down and get ready to laugh.Two star-crossed lovers from opposing houses, one a zombie and the other, wellnot, go against the societal norms of the zombie apocalypse and form a relationship in Warm Bodies.Being undead is a real drag, wandering around aimlessly, unable to remember anything about being alive, conflicted and lonely. Quirky doesn't even begin to describe Warm Bodies. Based on Isaac Marion's novel of the same title, Warm Bodies is a zombie tale from the zombie perspective in a hilarious and original fashion. The jokes are dry and odd and put a spin on the humdrum aspects of real life. The re-imagination of the zombie apocalypse through the infected's eyes is fresh and innovative.Nicholas Hoult is R, R because that is all he can remember from his old life and human name. Oh yeah, did we mention R is the star of the film and a zombie? Just as the tagline of the film states, he is dead but he is getting warmer. Only Hoult could play a flesh eating zombie and make the audience feel the character's humanity. With subtle nuances in posture and glances, Hoult is entertainingly laugh-out-loud funny.""It's the end of the world as we know it"" seems to be a theme with movies in recent times, doesn't leave much hope for the future. But Warm Bodies leaves a lot of hope for the zombie genre, and puts the quintessential period on the subject. Warm Bodies is an inventive modern take on a Shakespearean tale with lighthearted humor and steadfast vision.Please check out our website for more complete reviews of all the recent releases.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Romance"
Subverting the genre ?Not quite..,"Its summertime in America, OK not really, since large swathes of the country are still blanketed under snow, but for Hollywood its about blockbuster time.Its that time of the year when America must suffer another apocalypse, which of course means there must be a CGI-ed post apocalyptic America to gawk at, which gives the studios a raison d'être by offering us yet another spin on how America may bounce back again from the dead.The makers of this film take this notion very seriously indeed and they give us a Zombie romance where the undead become the unloved, as a tiny zombie shuffle towards redemption.I saw a Twilight film once, (yes yes, I know), and to be honest, thought it was a perfectly entertaining film. And I totally understood the hysteria surrounding Robert Pattinson and Kristen Stewart.While watching Warm Bodies I was completely fooled into believing I was watching Ms Stewart when it fact it was Ms Teresa Palmer, her clone.Now thats a cheap trick but then who cares.Warm Bodies is another riff on the Zombie genre and tries to be cash in on the current craze for paranormal romance, just the way Beautiful Creatures recently did.I walked out of that affront of a film but this one was a little more tolerable.We start at square one, there has been a deadly epidemic and most Americans have turned Zombies, but this time there is a class divide, some are badder, the ""bonies"",erstwhile zombies, who against their better(ahem..) judgement have peeled away their unnecessary layers of skin and flesh to become lean mean killing machines.Now if you were a zombie, shuffling along slowly, seems a terrible handicap when hunting fitter humans for food, but zombies cant think, can they? Except to sniff out human flesh, and lunge for it? We will let this pass since this is a zombie film, remember? We see a zombie in a red hoodie who can't recall much about himself except the first alphabet of his name, R (Robert Pattinson maybe?). He has delusions of grandeur, he feels he has a heart and is capable of human emotions like befriending a fellow zombie.In this mix arrives Julie( lookalike alert!) and R eats her boyfriends brains, ingests his memories in the process, which will help him hook Julie.Julies father is Grigio (John Malkowitch) who is the leader of the last surviving group of humans, armed to the hilt , he has the whole arsenal of NRAs(whose members must have turned zombie too) legacy at his disposal, so he cant complain, and is determined to blow every zombie brain off, that he can find.That will undoubtedly pose serious problems for Julie and R when they do fall in love.What Malkotcih is doing in this film beats me, making pocket money maybe, but undoubtedly his presence is likely to sell quite a few tickets but loose him a few fans in the process.The makeup guys get the transition of the zombies to human just right, and so do the actors. Nicholas Hoult nearly pulls of a badly written role with his disciplined performance, the same cannot be said of Mr Malkowitch and Ms Palmer.Jonathan Levine has made a mixed bag of films which showcase his ambition but unfortunately he seems more preoccupied with become a saleable director than a good one. Warm Bodies tries to subvert the genre of zombie movies but in the process produces a film bereft of the charm required of a rom-com. The scenes between R and Julie have no chemistry and the sequences which set up their romance just do not add up to the imagination bending premise of a hot babe falling for a zombie who just killed her boyfriend. The scene where Julie reunites with her father is so devoid of emotion that it should alert us the director does not have his heart in the right place, unlike the zombies whose hearts are beginning to beat again.Jonathan Levine, the director is certainly not dead, just hope he gets warmer.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Romance"
"enjoyable, cute, unconventional zomedy","With a fresh point of view and a lack of unnecessary drama (unlike most of the recent Dawn of the Dead type films), this film is a real treat for the zombie fan. The baddies (skeletons) and the leader of the good guys aren't developed much or are very 1 dimensional, but the main character and his supports are great fun. This aspect makes it feel a bit like a short story/graphic novel where a larger scope was attached for the film but not developed.The soundtrack and use of music throughout was a big plus for me. I wouldn't have minded some more R/TV-M type gore (walking dead), but for PG-13, there are still a few entertaining hits.That said, this one is worth paying for.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Romance"
Wonderful Zombie Romance,"Its my best Zombie film I've ever seen. Undoubtedly the whole team worked hard for the result I guess .

Nice choice and nice tracks according to feelings and expressions. I will give 8.5 for the music.Acting : Nicholas is so hot and damn handsome zombie I admit. He did good. Palmer was looking so cute and sweet here that I wish I could be there. Her stuff was cool. The supporting roles were average.

"Childish, Cheesy and Boring.","I decided to watch this one weekend afternoon because it's received decent reviews and was recommended to me by a co-worker. I was very disappointed. If it wasn't for the last portion of the movie I would have given it a 3/10 but the ending somewhat redeemed it. However, the fact remains that the first 3/4 was very boring and cheesy. It felt like they were trying too hard to create something different and funny. What resulted was not what I had hoped for. There was so much error in logic (what logic there can be in a zombie type movie). It just didn't make any sort of sense. Throughout the movie I kept hoping for it to improve, increase suspense or at least keep me interested. Unfortunately, it did not. I would classify this as a B level horror film meets chick flick. Not something I would recommended unless your only other option is watching something Tyler Perry created.",5.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Romance"
Wonderfully Fresh,"When I first heard about Warm Bodies a few months ago, I was a bit intrigued. I thought, ""Zombies being cured? Not so new. Falling in love?! That's new..."" So, safe to say, I was interested in it for quite awhile. Then I saw the trailer, and several movie clips, and thereafter, I was hooked; hook, line and sinker.When I watched the movie two days ago, my first reaction was, ""Not too shabby."" But, as I've thought about more and more, I've realized... This was one of the most refreshing movies I've ever seen.When it comes to genre of horror movies, romances, comedies, and even mixtures of the three, I think it's safe to say we've seen it all and then some. Well, let me tell you now: Warm Bodies just blew that out the window.This movie is refreshing because I've never seen, or even heard, of anything quite like it.Now that I've discussed how much I liked the idea of the movie, let me tell you about what I thought of each individual aspect.The acting goes from decent, to great. Most of the acting is decent, while Nicholas Hoult plays R quite splendidly. R is a zombie that isn't quite as typical as the rest... He has quite a bit of thought running through his mind, and has a desire to connect with people; humans in particular. However... His being a zombie, as you can imagine, makes that quite difficult. When he sees Julie, there's an instantaneous connection that feels with her, causing him to want to protect her, instead of eating her, like the rest of the Dead would do in his position.It may be a bit surprising, given this movie's protagonist is a zombie... But, this movie really does belong in the genre of comedy. R is quite hilarious, you see. He doesn't talk much, but with his thought narrating the movie throughout, the things he thinks about are quite amusing. I thoroughly enjoyed his amusing perspective on life.While the way the trailer shows R's heart beating once (in a very cheesy way) when he first sees Julie, let me ease your fears... It's not that cheesy. That's in the trailer. The movie's different. Better, actually. Anyway. The idea, put in this particular way: ""The zombie was cured with love..."" is a bit corny. But, the way it actually is, is that R's heart begins to be revived with love, but Julie actually teaches him how to be human, again. The longer he spends with Julie, the more human he gets.There was one part, at the end of the movie (I will NOT say what it is; if you see the movie, you will know), that was unrealistic with what would happen with a shot to the chest...Overall, the movie was refreshing, new, keeps you on the verge of being on the edge of your seat, funny, and cute, all wrapped up into one, gruesome, romantic package. Although, from what I've read with other people, you either love it, or you hate it. But, then again, it was the same with The Avengers....Most definitely, and irrevocably, 10 out of 10 stars from me.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Romance"
Warm Bodies delivers an undead love story,"It's no secret the zombie craze is in full force thanks to some great films and TV shows on the subject. At this point there are so many zombie themed films hitting the market, there is very few that have anything unique to add to stand out. The latest Warm Bodies attempts to step out of the shadows of the others by creating a love story of sorts, mixed with some humor but is it effective or dead before it comes to life?Warm Bodies follows introspective zombie who, much like the rest of the population is cursed to walk as the undead feeding on human survivors. During a routine feeding, he meets a beautiful woman that he suddenly feels compelled to protect. As their relationship begins to grow so does the temperature in his body as he slowly begins to regain his humanity. Soon this effect starts to spread through the other zombies shining a beam of hope on humanity, but first they must contend with not only the trigger happy humans, but also the ferocious Bonie zombies who threaten everyone. The story is easily one of the more unique to come along for the genre, breaking all the zombie rules, but working pretty well. The first bit of the film is a bit slow, but not in an all bad way. As it moves forward things start to pick up a bit as the audience is given an inside look at the zombie's side of things. There is little explanation as to how the change really occurs, but makes little difference other than being a bit irritating. In addition there are some disconnects here and there in relation to how people would have acted towards a situation, but it is minor enough to not hurt it. Besides that this film works pretty well. It keeps itself pretty light, even during the darker moments and somehow manages to deliver an effective love story.The looks of the zombies fit the idea and feel of the film really well. They aren't overly gory like the norm, but can't be for this story to really work. Instead they introduce the Bonie's, which are skeleton type zombies that are there just to feast and kill anything in their path. The effects bringing these guys to life works pretty well and adds the much needed kick to keep it from being slow and sappy. If you are a zombie fan, then you will want to give Warm Bodies a chance. If for no other reason as it takes the genre into a fresh new direction, even if the characters are dead and rotting.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Romance"
Turned it off after an hour!,"I rarely give up on a film midway because I do my research before watching. Unfortunately with this one I just had to. It may have been a different take on the zombie theme (a zombie with feelings) and starred a couple of credited actors but sorry, it just did nothing for me. The story was ridiculous and took the zombie theme to a new higher unbelievable level. The usual display of intelligent people doing stupid things. After an hour the film seemed to be going no where and by then I'd put it in the category of pointless movies. Off button pressed.

"Zombies in the ""Twilight"" zone","While watching this movie I frequently thought: Wow, this storyboard must be written by a true illusionist. At the same time I thought what a freaky movie to be presented within afternoon hours. The zombies and especially the ""bonies"" look creepy like taken directly from a horror movie. Some parts of the movie are full of suspense and thrill. At least one could think it a teeny horror movie. But that is only one part of the story. The other is an rather ugly dead boy falls in love with a beautiful living girl. Sounds a bit like the Gothic version of ""Beauty and the beast"" or like ""Twilight"". But I bet that most teenage girls have experienced moments with boys their age which made them believe boys are zombies. You might know guys who could do with a good shower and some hairstyle before presenting themselves in front of the living. And I'm sure that lots of teenagers very clearly know how to behave, just like R, but when they act they rather feel like zombies. So you see, after all it's just an coming-of-age comedy.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Romance"
So... this is a thing,"The zombie apocalypse has come and a group of young survivors have left the safety of their walled community in order to search for supplies. Naturally the zombies attacks and our young female heroine's boyfriend gets eaten. At which point the movie decides to become a romantic comedy as the boyfriend-eating zombie in question decides that he's in love with her and promptly takes her back home with him.After that the film can do pretty much anything and it would be acceptable because it has already veered so far off the beaten track. And although the film doesn't go outright bat guano insane, it does contains some really weird scenes, which all still meld together rather well. The movie has a logic of its own it follows, even if that logic is so weird.The actors are also rather good. Special mention should go to Nicholas Hoult who manages to pour such presence into the lifeless corpse he plays. His zombie character plays all the zombie notes correctly, moaning, grunting and stiffly walking around, yet you can still somehow read a lot of emotions from his rotting face. This is at least partially helped by the fact that we get to follow his inner monologue, which in itself is one of the best parts of the movie, especially because Hoult's delivery is surprisingly well- suited for dry comedy.All that being said, the ending is rather disappointing. You can see it coming by looking at the film's overall tone, but it's still so filled with sugary fluff that I swear it gave me new cavities. I'm not saying the ending should have been filled with gore and suffering, but a modicum of moderation would have been appreciated.Still, not a bad film to check out if you're looking for a zombie movie that's different.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Romance"
A different story in Zombieland,"This movie Warm Bodies , I first saw with a couple of teachers who showed this movie Musttafa Quraishi Moiz Hanif in Arena Multimedia Institute . We could see a little bit maybe forty-five minutes of the movie, cause mostly we were just joking around while watching this movie, the class and everyone 😂 and the period was short . So yesterday after going through all the zombie movies and games. I finally saw this movie, and I have to say .. it's a uniquely different movie , you know cause these huge mega zombie franchises like Resident Evil and the Last of Us or The Walking Dead . There should be a cure which sort of ends the zombie fray which they showed in Resident Evil The Final Chapter . So here in this movie, we get to see first the zombie's point of view and a very different kinda best possible ending, since all the zombies were innocent humans once with emotions and sentiments , so the storytellers decided why not to change them drastically to becoming human again rather than eradicate them, it's based on a best-selling novel . So the bonding connection which R shares with his friend leads to a finality of the truce between humans and zombies, but the bonies which have completely converted to skeletons can't change back and they die . A very different movie.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Romance"
A whole different view,"I loved that someone referred to this as Wall-e with Zombies that is a very accurate description.It's not all blood and gore with a storyline that is from the humans perspective.

I don't know if I would have picked it initially but I'm glad I did. We all enjoyed it very much.If you're looking for a romantic comedy with a twist and excitement and crazy this is a good watch.

"Packed with Action, Comedy, & Zombie Romance.","8 Stars!I have to admit when I first saw the trailer I had absolutely no interest in seeing this. Finally I decided to give it a chance & I wish I did sooner. So let's dig right into it.Saved by the undead?!?! Who would have thought the undead could be heroes.The characters are intriguing & the story is heartwarming, literally! The message here is that in order to overcome being undead, you have to be human. It's all about relationships & communication, preferably face to face rather than being glued to your smart phone & posting your every thought or mundane activity to an electronic cosmos that literally isn't a warm body. It's not about the zombies. You notice that in the first few minutes of the movie. Look past the zombies & you'll see that it's a story about us. Humans! The world that we live in right now, is kind of like this. There's a sadness here because today in reality everyone has become a Zombie. So it's relatable.The music score was brilliant, blended into every scene, & was truly meaningful. Zombies communicating their feelings to living humans through old records was a great idea, & the rest of the score amazingly relevant at every scene. This was the final piece of the puzzle that planted this movie in my brain enough to want to watch it again. Though, one issue that bothered me was that some of the songs on the movie's soundtrack could have been left out or changed to something more original rather than the same songs you have heard in dozens of other movies before. To me it's too repetitive & unoriginal. It happens too often in movies today.As far as romantic stories go that has classic monster as one of the other significant half, Warm Bodies proves to be a sheer winner for its romance & comedy. Fans of the romance genre should look this one up as well, as it comes with that stamp of recommended approval!Overall, you can expect comedy, romance, action, suspense, & some 'cheese' :) but it's forgivable because it works for this type of movie. Warm Bodies has enough heart that makes this a zombie love story like none other.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Romance"
Mostly boring,"I generally do not like Rom-Coms, but I do like comedy horror so I thought the bend might be watchable. I was wrong. The concept might have potential...maybe, but the execution here was abysmal. I could not get into this movie on any level. And that's not just because the prolific musical interludes kept interrupting the story, if you want to call it that. The writing was blah, the acting was mediocre, and the pacing both monotonous and jerky. So the dood is dead, but is also capable of higher order thinking and self-reflection.

Twilight + Zombieland = Warm Bodies,"First of all, when I first watched the official trailer of the movie I didn't really liked it and I hadn't high expectations about it. Eventually, it wasn't as bad as I had imagined and it's way more better than the trailer. The plot of the movie was very interesting and innovative, because it's probably the first zombie romantic movie I have ever seen. The storyline was well-written, well-explained and easy to understand. The characters were very interesting, well-developed and really likeable. The casting of the movie was nice and their performances were decent, Nicholas's acting as a zombie was good. Also, it wasn't a scary movie, there weren't any jumpscares and the zombie's appearance wasn't creepy, at all. It wasn't a very graphic zombie movie and most kills weren't bloody, at all. I have to admit, the opening scene was very boring and not really promising. However, the 2nd and 3rd act were both very enjoyable, especially the ending scene. Sadly, it wasn't a very funny movie and there weren't many action-filled scenes.

Finally an American romantic zombedy,"Few would ever assume that a director could be ambitious enough to attempt to bridge the Twilight and Dawn of the Dead crowds until now.Unfortunately the Twilight crowd was obviously the group treated preferentially but the end result was still a solid combination of comedy, romance, and a splash of horror.This light-hearted ""zombedy"" tells of boy meets girl, but unfortunately boy has been on a steady diet of brains for sometime. Die hard zombie fans may want to look at other titles like Fido before taking a dip in the tween genre, as the zombies are indeed infected with the dreaded plot- convenient-zombie-virus.If you are looking for a fun date movie that has a little bit of the mainstream and the fringe then look no further.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Romance"

"A love story wrapped up in a zombie flick, a perfect date movie perhaps","Zombies, shuffling living dead with decomposing bodies and dead eyes, craving human brains to sustain them.But what if you were a Zombie and were conflicted about it, going through the motions, the shuffling, mumbling and munching but maybe with a trace of humanity left, could you be saved? Turning the traditional Zombie flick on it's head, this has ""R"" (Nicholas Hoult) finding his inner human when confronted with a pretty vivacious victim, wanting to protect her rather than chow down on the usual grey matter.Making a Zombie/Human love story has significant risks but largely the film pulls it off. This is mainly down to good casting with Hoult and Teresa Palmer as ""Julie"" making for a good couple, notwithstanding the obvious obstacles in the path of true love.Following the usual zombie apocalypse, ""R"" lives in a deserted airliner complete with vinyl based music system, as it sounds purer, who knew that zombies had such audiophile good taste. When the surviving humans venture outside their protective wall for food and medical supplies, they are at risk. Capturing or saving ""Julie"", after a reasonably scary opening sequence, the film makes fun of the genre, as ""R"" teaches his new girlfriend how to mumble and shuffle. Less is more, is the approach in case you are ever faced with that situation.The shocks are reasonably scary, the gore is largely off screen or implied, in keeping with the PG certificate, which overall is a good choice for this light and frothy tale.Of course no zombie film can exist without the military turning up with assorted weaponry, this time complicated by the leader of the group ""Grigio"" (John Malkovich) being the father of ""Julie"". Understandably this father/daughter dynamic changes the story somewhat.There is also a pecking order of zombies with ""Bonies"", which are provided by CGI, the lowest of the low and irredeemable. This provides a handy disposable enemy, should events turnaround later.Julies friend ""Nora"" (Tipton) adds to the fun, when the pair decide to makeover ""R"" to make him more presentable, or even ""hot"". If only the internet was available to enable them to update their Facebook page, ""Bummer"".There are faults, the dialogue is occasionally clunky, Malkovich gets very little to do and ""R"" manages to recover his vocabulary remarkably quickly. The post apocalyptic world is presented believably, albeit on a budget and the effects are more than adequate. The story, once it makes the turn, gets wrapped up rather quickly and neatly, not outstaying its welcome at a short 98 minutes.There might have been a better story for a third act, drawing parallels with certain administrations whereby the authorities are actually the bad guys using the threat of ""zombies"" to control the masses. Zombie threat inconveniently disappears but they have no wish to give up power but this is not that film.Instead the story is about love or connection and the power of redemption it can bring. Although the film does add a touch of irony when the ""real world"" is seen, with everyone in their own private world with their mobile phones.SummaryGood fun with a few scares, essentially a love story wrapped up in a zombie flick, a perfect date movie perhaps?",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Romance"
"I Am Dead, But It's Not So Bad...","This movie tries really hard to be an updated Romeo & Juliet, even going as far as to name the main characters after them...or at least a call out to them. I really like Nicholas Hoult and Teresa Palmer, so I probably enjoyed it more than it deserved. The film isn't horrifying enough to be a great Zombie movie, and not charming enough to be a great Romance. Its relatively short run time still felt like way too long and that, to me, is a result of the movie not having a clear vision of what it wanted to be. I rarely expect movies to be entirely believable. They are there for entertainment after all. That being said, in order for the basic premise to work, the Zombies had to start off way more intelligent than any reanimated corpse would ever be and that only served to make it very difficult to go with the flow. It isn't a terrible way to spend an hour and a half because the leads are invested in what they are doing, but I wouldn't really classify it as good.",5.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Romance"
Expected the worst,"So I heard going in to watch this movie is that it was ""zombie twilight"" and I thought to myself, ""dear god how are they going to try to make rotting corpses into teenage sex symbols"". The movie doesn't take itself too seriously and as long as you aren't looking for seriousness, it's a very funny and interesting movie to watch. Sure the ""power of love"" and all that jazz is overdone, but it didn't go over the top with the romance, it was just quick paced and humorous. And hey, John Malcovitch is great in any movie, so it's worth checking out just for that. The music really makes this film and sets the tone. If the music had been super serious twilight stuff I would have just laughed at the ridiculousness of every scene where romance was involved, but there were a lot of funny song choices. Which made me laugh WITH the movie and not AT the movie. And I was genuinely surprised to see that they did actually make zombies sexy at a point, that's a pretty strange achievement.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Romance"
a true rom-com-zom,"Horror and comedy don't usually make a good combination (there are a couple of exceptions like Shaun of the Dead/Zombieland) but in this instance they've hit the nail on the head. Don't get me wrong, you want need to leave the bedroom light on after watching it but in dealing with the old 'apocalypse/zombie' theme you're automatically entering the horror genre.Nicholas Holt makes a great zombie, maybe that's a reflection on his natural acting ability. His character is likable from the offset, his Hugh Grant-esque first person commentary witty, heart warming and thought provoking but he also carries off the undead pimp limp with great aplomb.I love the way the story develops, adds a bit of tension and excitement and then leaves you feeling content and a wee bit fuzzy like anything with a bit of romance in it should.At the end i turned my other half and we both said 'good film', that rarely happens!",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Romance"
A Nutshell Review: Warm Bodies,"With werewolves and vampires hogging the cinema screens in the last few years under romantic genres, perhaps it is timely now to explore if zombies can fit into the same picture as well, and being a more interesting prospect at that since there's no icky bestiality involved, nor necessary have to be uber-sexy and charming like a vampire should be. Zombies are basically rotten walking corpses of the undead, lumbering – or in recent times, running - around seeking out humans for food, with a preference to feast on human brains as a delicacy. They're easy to put away with conventional rounds into the head, unlike werewolves and vampires that require specialized skills and weapons, so they go around in hordes where strength in numbers tend to overwhelm.Then came writer Isaac Mario and his idea for his novel, to get into the shoes of the other side, and walk around in them for a little. As far as I recall, not since Fido had we a cinematic zombie who tried his darnedest best to assimilate back into the life of a human, with thoughts still lingering about filling an intense void in the unbeating heart of his. Zombies can hardly talk, save for the occasional grunts, and what director Jonathan Levine managed to do, is to have the film's narration peek into the thinking head of R (Nicholas Hoult), a zombie who is experiencing existentialism issues, and providing us a quick update into the rules of the game in which Warm Bodies operate under.And no, there's no sparkling nonsense under sunlight. What was proposed were highly feasible and worthy addition to the zombie canon, where the first person perspective here provides us with that up close and personal look at the dilemma of being an undead, where the feasting of humans, and their brains specifically, allows for the zombies to momentarily adopt the memories of those they are consuming, and allowing them that slightest chance to feel alive again. If that's the case, then I don't see why they behave the way they do, with that dietary preference. And for those who are zombies for long, they eventually lose all sense of humanity and become skeletons, whose sole objective is to feast. And there were a number of essential presentations that just serve to enhance those parameters the narrative has to operate within.The story truly begins when R, on a feasting hunt, meets up with a surviving bunch of humans outside of their walled city to look for medicine, and smitten by Julie (Teresa Palmer), takes her under his wing to keep her safe, as well as the ulterior motive of romancing the girl. Conveniently living aboard a jetliner at the airport, which provides that airtight condition to keep her human scent from other zombies, close proximity with only each other meant plenty of opportunities to get to know the other party, and who would have known, fall in love. It's a modern day Romeo & Juliet story set against a zombie apocalypse backdrop, with that instantly recognizable token balcony scene to boot, that would set the hearts of romantic die- hards aflutter, since adversary comes in the form of Julie's dad Colonel Grigio (John Malkovich).In this love conquering all tale, Levine perhaps wanted to tell the tale of how love provides the key to what would be a seemingly hopeless situation, especially amongst those ""Zombiefied"" amongst us who live life as soulless routines. There never was any attempts so far to suggest how zombies could revert to human form, and this story had the audacity to do just that, making that bold statement to set it apart from the competition. Between the two leads of Nicholas Hoult and Teresa Palmer, clearly Hoult is now seeing his star shining brighter, with lead roles here and in other blockbusters like Jack the Giant Slayer, cementing his status to heartthrob levels with his boyish charm on the big screen. With the material, he did his best rendition of the lumbering, awkward zombie R who finds his heart getting warmer and his mannerisms slowly giving way to become more human like. Palmer didn't have much to do as the damsel usually in distress, though having moments to show she's no pushover as well. But ultimately it's a role that could have been played by any other starlet, save for her solid chemistry opposite Hoult.As far as romantic stories go that has classical monsters as one of the other significant half, Warm Bodies proves to be a sheer winner for its romance and comedy, together with its eclectic selection of pop tunes that make up its soundtrack. As a fan of Rob Corddry, I have to make note of his supporting role here that came as a surprise to have been a little bit more than expected, but I'm not complaining. Warm Bodies has enough heart that makes this a zombie love story like none other. Fans of the romance genre should lap this one up as well, as it comes with that stamp of recommended approval!",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Romance"
"Comedy, romance, evil creatures, apocalyptic setting, war & hope, in a light-hearted zombie wrapper","For those who overlooked this funny, entertaining film because, basically, it's about zombies, you're missing out. There are few good and myriad poor examples of the teen supernatural love story film out there these days, but ""Warm Bodies"" falls pretty well into the ""good"" end of the spectrum.R, well played by ""About a Boy"", ""Skins"" and ""X-Men: First Class"" actor Nicholas Hoult, is a relatively self-aware zombie who does all the right zombie things. He doesn't remember his human life, shuffles around the airport where he ""lives"", grunts ""conversations"" with his best friend M (The Daily Show's Rob Corddry), and participates in feeding raids where he devours the brains of the few remaining humans for sustenance and the chance to live a little by experiencing their memories as though they were his. On one feeding frenzy, after eating the brain of her boyfriend (Dave Franco), R encounters Julie (Take Me Home Tonight's Teresa Palmer) and spontaneously decides not only to not eat her, but to protect her from the other zombies. The more time they spend together, the more human he becomes – gaining more and more speaking ability and knowledge, and less and less desire to mindlessly kill and do nothing. And the awareness is spreading. But danger lurks in the form of super skeleton zombies, who have lost every last shred of humanity (including skin and hair) and are much taller, faster and more agile than your average zombie, and in the human-protection-through-zombie-extermination philosophy of Julie's military leader father, played by John Malkovich.I'm ashamed to say it took me longer than it should have to catch the obvious play on Romeo and Juliet here (I mean, R and Julie, come on, right?!), but it's a very loose interpretation (as half the cast being zombies alone attests to). The story is straightforward and not overly developed or reliant on heavy mythology. Zombies have already taken over the world when the film starts, and we don't know, or really care, why or how. The commentary by R gives voice to his physically comedic, mostly-silent acting, and is genuinely funny. Hoult and Palmer are an engaging pair of young actors, carrying their irreverent roles with aplomb, and solid turns by Corddry and Malkovich make their roles memorable. Franco and former America's Next Top Model contestant Analeigh Tipton, as Julie's best friend, deliver acceptable performances but don't stand out. It's no Oscar contender by a long-shot, but ""Warm Bodies"" is a gore-and-war, comedic, supernatural love story that will make you smile and leave you feeling, yes, warm and satisfied.

I <3 this movie,"Adapting a popular novel to film is always a very challenging thing. You have to try and please the fan base as well as making it accessible enough so that people can find a way to relate to it. It's even trickier when that source material is so uniquely weird. It's a hard thing to pull off such a successful adaptation and that is the reason why Warm Bodies is so damn impressive. Centering around a zombie who calls himself R played by the adorable Nicholas Hoult who while on a hunting spree with his fellow undead finds himself falling in love with Julie played by the really impressive Teresa Palmer, one of my new favorites. There's a little more to it than that but it's hard to explain without it sounding a little too bizarre. I myself have read the book and was a big fan of it and although the film differentiates from the source material it really nails the feel and ultimate message of it all while remaining true to it and just completely committing itself to it's cooky concept. In some instances it even enhances it with subtext of about adolescence, human connection and society in general. It also helps that strong performances populate the film throughout most notably by the 2 leads and Rob Corrdry as Marcus R's best friend. The film is funny, a little gross, a little scary and just really endearing. It's a sweet but dark valentine for people who want there rom coms a little edgy. Zombie fans may be a little disappointed at the films lack of actual horror but if their open will find an exciting new angle to revisit the now clichéd material. I've heard a lot of people comparing this film to Twilight and the truth is although I'm a fan of that series this is far more complex, clever and not as mushy. Warm Bodies is a film that should be celebrated as it takes the chance to break new ground and for that alone in a slew of unnecessary remakes and sequels that is a truly special thing. 4/5",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Romance"

Brilliant,"***may contain spoilers*** When I went to the cinema with my friends I kept thinking about how many other things I could be doing at that time instead of going to that ridiculous movie. When the movie started I was thinking, ""Brilliant, how long is this movie again?"" But as the movie progressed and I got familiar with the story line I began to enjoy it. I was really impressed with what they had done. I loved how it was Shakespeare related, especially the part when R goes to Julie's balcony(Romeo and Juliet, R and Julie). This is a great romance film for couples and a great suspenseful, horror movie for friends. If you are one of those people thinking this movie is lame and not worth your time I would greatly suggest giving this movie a chance. I have heard that the book is much darker and gruesome so I am going to have to find that book! Anyway, great movie, great cast, just a brilliant movie.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Romance"
"Warm Bodies is a quirky amusing twist of old ideas, wittily written and warmly entertaining.","Otherwise known as Romeo and Juliet in Zombie Apocalypse, also despite the overwhelming Twilight vibe oozing from it, Warm Bodies is a funny undead flick and quiet charming in its wordless execution. Its self-aware lightly toned comedy composes lay back youthful attitude in the form of a zombie's monologues and his deficit on vocabulary. The antique plot may seem rigidly predictable, fortunately it has some freedom on delivery, making it a fresh tongue-in-cheek dystopian humor since Shaun of the Dead and Zombieland.Nicholas Hoult as R, is a good pick for the lively-minded undead protagonist. He has tall thin frame and apparent cheek bones, making him a believable zombie after a few touch of pasty foundations, all while cosplaying as the latest apparition of Dante. To his credit, this role suits him perfectly, he has minor motions that are cleverly stiff and humorous, which fits the novel sensation of courting living female. It's amazing that with much scarcer lines, he triumphs over his role as the recent Jack, the digital giant killer.Julie, played by Teresa Palmer, is your typical blond gorgeous chick. She moves rather well, although not full blown action star yet, but she makes for a convincing role of someone who grows up in cryptic world with daddy issue. Her emotions are expressed gradually, she has natural ambiance and it will attract the young audience, and even if she didn't stand out much in acting department, her looks elevate her performance. John Malkovich as the source of Julie's daddy issue is emotionally imposing. He has the air of someone you don't want to mess with, standing near to antagonism.Graphically, it's captivating. The world after zombie virus is depicted with great cinematography, barren gray dye, and still pertains few of its charms, which are subtly placed beneath a crumbling civilization. The set might be grim, but it doesn't depress, landmarks and trivial places have distinct salvageable atmosphere to them. Its use of make-up and wardrobe is simple, most often lacking color as R's red lackluster jacket, it emphasizes the little humanity left without going full zombie.CG for skeletal extremely-dead undead is rather plastic, it's obviously fake. There are some plot devices that are set conveniently as well. Details like these might not ruin the enjoyment, but they still register as annoyances. Warm Bodies is a quirky amusing twist of old ideas, it is wittily written and warmly entertaining.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Romance"
Good Start :-) .......................Poor Finish :-(,Warm Bodies opened quite cleverly with humorous dialog and an understanding of characters. However the direction of both the story and humor seemed to go only downhill from there. Ultimately in the end the combination of zombie horror genre and romantic humor just did not seem to mix well.Shuan of the Dead is an fantastic example of a mix of genre done well (Zombie Horror and Humor) and has a good build up of characters.Warm Bodies provided characters that were shallow stereotypical teen types and really everyone just seemed to shallow to care about. I must give credit to the FX peps who did the Skelton Zombies they looks scary and if the movie had involved more action it may have been better.,5.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Romance"
Unexpectedly great,"No spoilers here so don't worry.So I began watching this film with the intent of just making fun of it and laughing AT what was going on rather than WITH the intended jokes. Because to be honest, a ZOMBIE ROMANCE FILM? C'mon. Zombies are probably the least romantic and attractive of the supernatural category. But man, was I surprised.From the first moment, I was completely invested in the fate of the main character because of his dry, awkward sense of humour. I only realised after a while that he's played by Nicholas Hoult, i.e., the Beast from X Men: First Class.And sure, the basic plot of the film is a bit predictable but by the time the viewers reach that point, they honestly wouldn't care or would completely agree.This film promises to make you laugh and fulfill your wish of a romance genre too in a high school teen romance between a pretty girl with an overprotective father and an awkward social outcast who just HAPPENS to be a zombie in an apocalyptic scenario.I'd give it a 7/10 overall and I suggest you all watch it!",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Romance"
A funny comedy with minor problems,"When it comes to zombies, everybody pretty much shares the same opinion. If you were to come in contact with one, either run as fast as possible or shoot it in the head. Although this situation has never occurred, it's at least some kind of solution to an extremely difficult problem. The zombie itself has changed numerous times over the past several years. Initially with its introduction in George A. Romero's Night of the Living (1968), the zombie has been portrayed as a mindless eating machine. An empty vessel looking only to gorge itself in its crave for human flesh and to do nothing else. Or at least, this is what we uninfected humans believe. What if under all the decaying exterior and faded color was a functioning brain that was aware of its current condition but could not control the system that carried it? What if there was an actual cure for the plaque that made everyone so lifeless? Well that's what Isaac Marion's novel explored in the book of the same name Warm Bodies. This adaptation of it is well done too.Written and directed by Jonathan Levine (50/50 (2011)), the story follows a zombie named R (Nicholas Hoult) who is indifferent on his current state. He only eats when threatened but on the off chance of finding him, he'd rather try to communicate. As far as R knows, he's the only one who started out with this thought process. One day when hunger gets the better of him, he manages to come in contact with a female human named Julie (Teresa Palmer) and brings her back to his home (which is an abandoned airplane). As they stay with each other, they begin to bond. Meanwhile on the sides, both protagonists' parties don't catch on. Marcus (Rob Corddry) one of R's zombie pals almost mistakes Julie for food, while Julie's father Grigio (John Malkovich) looks to annihilate all zombies in his way. Considering the director who also acted as the writer handled this production, it's impressive. There's quite a bit of development that goes on among characters and that's for both factions.To help the viewer understand R better, much of the reasoning and motivational decisions made by him are explained through voice-over by Hoult in order to know what he's thinking. There's also explanations given as to how R understands other people and as to why he eats aside from being threatened. However, the one aspect that Levine did not cover is how R became self-aware. How did it happen? When did it happen? Of all the zombies around him, nobody felt the same way he did anywhere else? It's possible but highly unlikely. The only other issue this horror comedy has is its rating. In the past there have been horror films released by the MPAA with a PG-13 rating. Yet for this movie, the violence isn't super gory but there are a number of bloody scenes. Even one of the characters drops an F bomb, so why not just go all the way? It's obvious this could have been rated R too because all the ""blood"" that's on screen has mainly been coated in a black ooze color. This is what keeps the MPAA from giving it the restricted label. Seriously though?Nonetheless, the acting is great in this picture. Nicholas Hoult as R has quite the charm going for him being undead and all. There are some real moments that show that there's something ticking inside his head. Teresa Palmer although representing the female strong head trope in horror films, her character's courage is noted and her chemistry with Hoult is amiable. Plus as both develop, the audience will see the struggles both need to accept. Rob Corddry as Marcus plays a funny counter to R in his mannerisms and actions. The same can be said for Analeigh Tipton who plays Julie's friend Nora. Both actors act as the protagonists' backup in a comical manner. John Malkovich as Julie's father has a much smaller role to play and although he's not around for long, his motivations are clearly defined and explain why he acts the way he does. There's even an appearance by Dave Franco playing Julie's ex; he probably has the least amount of development among the rest of his cast members. The antagonists are called bonies, walking skeleton zombies.For the bonies, they have no conscience whatsoever. Special effects wise, they seem to be the weakest aspect because of just how rigid they move. They have a look that resembles very close to Stephen Sommers' The Mummy (1999) CGI. However, the cinematography Javier Aguirresarobe was handled well. Even for the chase scenes, the camera felt very steady. All scenes captured the right amount of landscape, whether being in R's airport or in the humans' bunker. Aguirresarobe also filmed for the Fright Night (2011) remake, Goosebumps (2015) and The Finest Hours (2016). For music, Marco Beltrami and Buck Sanders (a Beltrami collaborator) composed the score. Surprisingly, this is the second score (the other being The Sessions (2012)) produced by Beltrami that rarely sounds like his previous horror scores. There are moments that involve blaring horns, but much of the score is comprised of bells, harps and piano that represent themes for R and Julie. They are simply one the most beautiful themes ever composed by him and it is by far one of his most recognizable and its quite pleasing.Writer/director Levine forgets a few areas in the script to elaborate on when it comes to logic, but a lot of the time, it will wholesomely immerse the audience into the mind of R. It also could've been rated R, but aside from that, the comedy between the leads work, the camera-work is good and the music is the heart tugging centerpiece.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Romance"
"Not Terrible, but Forgettable Wasted Potential","Warm Bodies was a movie that I really wanted to like and one that I thought I'd really like. A zombie love story is a concept that is pretty promising. You would think it would be comedic, clever, cute, and creative. However, I found it to be none of these things. I found Warm Bodies to be boring, predictable, and uninspired.I feel like the movie is trying to advertise itself as ""Not your typical romance story."" But that's exactly what it feels like. I personally don't feel any connection between the two characters. Neither of them are particularly likeable, which is a problem when the whole story revolves around those two characters. What's even more frustrating is that I think R could have been a really lovable character. R, like the other zombies, can only speak in broken English, but the audience can hear his internal dialogue. This specific reason is why R is unlikeable. There's something so endearing about monstrous characters with a soft side, and all of that is thrown away when they make him such a main character for a teen romantic comedy. As for the love interest, Julie, she's even worse. There is no level of relatability to attach to her. That's not saying that every character should be relatable or even likeable, but like I said: The movie revolves around these two.Warm Bodies is extremely predictable and cliche. And I hate the word ""cliche"" but it's really the only word to use here. Every plot point, every scene, every bit of dialogue can be seen ahead from the very start. This may seem like an inconvenient factor that wouldn't affect the movie, but it does. Just because there's zombies, that doesn't make it at all creative. In fact, it feels like one of the least creative movies I've seen in a long time.In conclusion, Warm Bodies is... not good. I'm not going to say that this is one of the worst films ever because it's not by any means. There are many films that are technically worse.

Can Zombies be sweet?,"I read the book before I saw the movie and I was pleasantly surprised that they translated it well.Zombies were not of the ""Walking Dead""variety ... think TWD PG Version, but I think think that choice worked well with the mood of the movie.Comedic and romantic moments are well placed and well acted.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Romance"
A refreshing take on humanity,"I felt that this movie was a great movie, it had parts that didn't make sense to us as people who know what a zombie is or does. As you watch it you slowly your mind starts to accept whats going on and you find yourself encouraging ""R"" silently. You want him to succeed. I found myself in certain points nodding my head in approval of the things that were going on and hoping for a full change, Willing him to not ""relapse"" into zombie mode. This isn't the walking dead. Know that before you go and see it. walk in with an open mind and you wont be disappointed. To the cast of this movie. Great Job! Bravo.

The Romeo and Juliet Factor,"Well, some fun scenes make Warm Bodies an okay movie.

Rom-zom-com with more rom than zom-com,"I thought it was great, a very sweet touching and gently amusing movie - although, at it's (undead) heart this movie is a romance first and foremost. There's a bit of 'horror' (that would be the zombies and their bony frenemies) and a bit of comedy (if you count the deadpan - no pun - monologues from R and a few nice one liners from M) but there's a whole lot more romance. I think many viewers mistook the movie to be more horror/comic than it actually aspired to be.I really enjoyed it - because I'm one of those people with a guilty pleasure that is romantic comedy - and found the lead actors very convincing. R's self musings were wonderfully written and I also liked that Julie wasn't the kind of girl that inevitably falls over, while wearing underclothes, during a chase scene or screamed every 5 minutes for no discernible reason. Overall is it clichéd? Sure - but who cares? It was a cool take on an old theme, with a couple of chuckles and nice undead makeups thrown in.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Romance"
New Idea and Well Done,This came out amidst zombie movie after zombie movie that all seemed to tell the same story. This was a very fresh idea and it was incredibly well done. It knows what kind of movie it is and it nails it. Warm Bodies takes a more intimate look into what life would be like during the Zombie Apocalypse.The development of the characters is excellent. I loved R's character throughout the whole move. He's quite relatable.It's not a deep or groundbreaking movie but it's certainly a different idea to see the world from the point of view of a zombie.I absolutely loved it and have even gone back to watch it a few times over the years.If you missed it you need to see it.,8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Romance"

"Really wanted to like this movie, but ...","I really liked the idea of transforming the stale zombie genre into something other, but this movie takes itself so painfully serious it´s embarassing.1. Really good costume design makes the bad CGI creatures even less believable.
2. Things happen and characters change motivation without any explanation.
3. If You want to establish different zombies, maybe you should do some worldbuilding first.
4. The things they establish aren´t coherent. I.e. slow zombies become fast just because.
5. Too little on-screen chemistry between the main characters for my taste (my god, I sound like a RomCom snob)
6. Worst of all: this movie takes itself too serious to establish a tongue and cheek interpretation of a horror trope.",4.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Romance"
A fresh twist to the zombie genre -cute and heartwarming,"This was cute, funny and kinda heartwarming giving a fresh twist to the zombie genre. Based on the book by Isaac Marion, the movie managed to capture 'R's' self deprecating, sarcastic and humorous voice especially in the beginning, as he describes his ""life"" to the viewer, what an average day is like for one of the undead shuffling around a post apocalyptic airport.The beginning of this movie was super good. If I'm honest though I did find parts of this(maybe even as a whole) a little slow.R is kinda tortured, seeking a connection as he feels there must be more. After he rescues 'Julie' from a zombie attack the two form a relationship and he experiences a profound transformation, becoming increasingly more human. There is a definite Romeo and Juliet vibe going on here as Julie is the daughter of a military leader (John Malkovich) charged with eradicating the undead. Their romance aspect was cute.Teresa Palmer plays Julie and at times reminded me of Kristen Stewart, something about her look and the frown in her brow, her awkwardness. Nicholas Hoult does an excellent job as R, I enjoyed watching his transformation, his struggle with speech, memory, making his body work properly. I also liked Analeigh Tipton and Rob Corddry in their BFF roles. Dave Franco has a smaller ""brainer"" part.The soundtrack mostly consists of 80's music and I should mention the ""Bonies"". They're the bad zombies here and reminded me of those stop motion sword fighting skeletons from that 1963 movie 'Jason and the Argonauts'. Very jerky looking. Not sure if this was intentional or not? 7/1/15",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Romance"
A Very Charming Film,"I have seen just about every Zombie and Vampire film and series out there and found this particular twist to be quite entertaining.From the first internal monologue I was drawn into the story.It is an entirely different and delightful film that is devoid of stupid frustrating moments.It has a few predictable parts but the overall staging and emotional investment that is massaged by the film sure seem to make those issues irrelevant as one waits for the continuance of the warm charm that this film offers.I particularly liked the sub themes of friendship, love and loyalty that are comedically weaved into the tapestry of this movie.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Romance"
It had me at hello,"""Warm Bodies"" is a solid entry in the ""fun zombie movie"" sub-genre. It tells very unique story in a nice way. The two lead actors, Nicholas Hoult and Teresa Palmer, are very appealing. Their interaction is really cool. Did I cry watching this movie? No, I didn't. Will I cry in the future (because I expect to be watching this movie quite often)? Probably. I liked ""Warm Bodies"". I think it's the kind of movie that gets better with each viewing.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Romance"
More Brains than Your Average Rom Com,"Zombies have been all the rage as of late, with undead themed movies and TV shows reaching near saturation point. Naturally this has resulted in a fair number of parodies, each with their own take on the genre. Zombieland mashed gory horror with a road movie. Shaun of the Dead was The Office with zombies. And now Warm Bodies reimagines the zombie apocalypse as a rom com in which love is you need to recover your humanity.It starts predictably enough with a zombie eating a young man's brains. Only in the process he gains his victim's memories, plus his feelings for his girlfriend- who the zombie proceeds to save and take home with him. And from there love eventually blossoms, with wider implications for relations between humanity and zombie-kind.I know: on the face of it, the idea of Zombies coming back to life by learning to love sounds like a really stupid idea. It's one that could easily have dissolved into sappiness or pure ridiculousness. But this movie manages to make it work, with hilarious and sometimes heartwarming results. It works partly because it's stated clearly and very early on that in the context of this movie Zombism is a metaphor for emotional detachment and feeling dead inside. And of course, the cure for that is personal connections, especially love. So in that framework the premise mostly makes sense. It's actually believable, if scientifically impossible, even by the standards of zombie movies.The premise also works because the protagonist is so likeable and adorably awkward. For a zombie he's a really nice guy. He eats the brains of the living, but he feels really bad about it. He sort of remembers being human and wishes he could go back. He even has a best friend, kind of. And his constant internal monologue is charmingly geeky and kind of neurotic, like Michael Cera in one of his better roles. And things only get cuter and more awkward as his relationship with his new girlfriend starts to unfold.At first, she's naturally afraid for her life, and he nervously tries not to scare her any more. It's quite charming to see her feelings for him gradually develop into non-revulsion, then trust, then something approaching love. The movie wisely takes its time with this, never rushing or forcing the relationship. The added twist also fixes some of the problems plague most romantic comedies. For once, there's a good reason for the awkwardness and stupid misunderstandings that get in the way of their love. He literally can't talk to her. And she has a much stronger reason than usual for not wanting to bring him home to dad.Just as interesting as the relationship itself is the gradual transformation back life to that accompanies it. Watching him regain his humanity bit by bit is quite inspiring, especially when the effects prove contagious.The one major criticism I have is that the movie kind of wimped out and never made a major reveal between characters that should have been a major part of the plot. And admittedly Warm Bodies isn't very scary, even compared to Zombieland or Shaun of the Dead. But there are some pretty frightening scenes at the beginning, and a good amount of action and suspense towards the end. And above all, it's a very sweet and surprisingly smart romantic comedy. The zombies may be lifeless and brain-dead, but the movie isn't.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Romance"

A Unique Romantic Comedy with a Touch of Shakespeare,"Romantic comedies are particularly difficult to reinvent. They are typically a formula of ""boy meets girl, boy looses girl, boy wins girl"" with some variations. There is usually another romantic interest. ""Warm Bodies"" adds a totally unique and fresh twist to the formula. Boy meets girl, but he's a zombie.This movie is very much based on Shakespeare's ""Romeo and Juliet"". Instead of the Montagues and Capulets it's the living and the zombies. There are many more subtleties that reference Romeo and Juliet.The music in the movie is incredible! It is used very effectively.There are also several scenes that are far more artistically filmed than one would expect in a romantic comedy.Before seeing it, my teenage son was very critical of a romantic comedy zombie movie. He found it to be nearly as enjoyable as I did. It is a feel good fun movie. It is well worth seeing.I should note that I gave it a ""10"" rating because it currently is below 7 on IMDb (which it shouldn't be). In my opinion it should be in the upper 7's or low 8's.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Romance"
Best surprise of the year so far. Genuine and hilarious.,"Who knew the simple combination of a socially awkward teenager and a zombie could be so hilarious and heart-warming? I expected something pretty silly from this film and was surprised when it grabbed me in its first minutes with its relateability and its kinetic atmosphere. I was curious as to how this film would be executed and I was delighted to find that it's through the disassociated narration of Nicholas Hoult's character. There's something brilliant about how he's a zombie on the outside with that kind of inner monologue, it highlights that huge gap teenagers have from their thoughts and actions. The story takes relatively predictable steps from then on in but its blissful simplicity, quirky sense of humour and creative choice of antagonist tiers keeps it engaging. It's very cinematically shot as well with a great soundtrack. It completely won me over when a character chose to play a Bruce Springsteen track for a bonding montage. Jonathan Levine disappointed me with the lifeless 50/50, it seems he was saving it all for Warm Bodies. Best surprise of the year so far.8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Romance"
Zombie Romance? That is executed really well.,"The idea of a zombie fallen in love with a human is a ridiculous concept, but the execution is done really well. The story builds up their relationship really great on how first she doesn't trust him, but soon grow attractive to him. I also think the idea of love is a cure for zombies is a silly and interesting idea for a movie. We also see how the zombies are slowly becoming more alive throughout the runtime of the movie which works in with the development of the movie. The comedy is done pretty well for it and there's a couple of clever funny moments in the movie.The horror aspects of the movie (other than the zombies) are the Boney which fits in well in the movie showing them more threatening than the zombies in this movie. I also love the climax where the zombies and the Boney fight each others which is both entertaining and suspenseful. And I like how the movie ends.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Romance"
Fun Twist,"Warm Bodies had some unique twists and turns not seen in other zombie movies that came before it as well as some good performances. Our main zombie was very well cast too, perfectly suited performance and screen presence. There weren't detractors from the far too common poor excuses for wit or poor language in so many scripts. It's great to see movie makers without the need for those weak crutches. I enjoyed this flick thoroughly when I saw it originally and again these years later.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Romance"
The Cutest Zombie Ever,"This is not going to be a helpful review! I just had to say this... I did not expect this movie. If a Zombie can be considered cute, it is R!

I also loved how Julie got over her prejudice fairly quickly.But this, this is not horror. Is you don't take into account the few gory scenes, this was fluff all the way.

A Revenant Zombie film that appeals to the romantics who can laugh at absurdity,"Look up ""Revenant Zombie."" ""While conceptually very old, and the prototype from which many other undead derive, this trope has fallen out of favor for more modern breeds of zombie, and for the bloodsucking vampire."" This is not the first zombie movie to show talking/reasoning zombies (Return of the Living Dead, The Nightmare Before Christmas, Wreck it Ralph, Day of The Dead, Land of The Dead). This is not the first romantic zombie film (Fido, Bride of Frankenstein, ""Fear Itself"" New Year's Day, My Boyfriend's Back). This is not Twilight (Twilight and its 3 sequels are Twilight, and we don't have to fear it's gonna get us. Don't worry, there will still always be dark and gruesome horror films. And for Twilight fans, there will always be darkly romantic films for you. No need to fight.) I have seen around 100 zombie films, and this is by far not even close to some of the crappier zombie films, though it was pretty unique and sweet and funny.You have to have a soft spot for romance to enjoy this and you have to notice that it is a commentary on society without love. Life without love is no life at all. That's the message and I think it's powerful enough to resonate with those who don't require the usual cliché zombie film. We have plenty of zombie films that are just about surviving, but we have far less about living.If you want to watch a realistically dark zombie film, maybe this isn't for you. If you want a very violent and gory zombie film, maybe this isn't for you. But if you don't hate films just for being different or appealing to romantics, you might just enjoy this. It's not Oscar material, but I genuinely prefer the quirky stuff that isn't widely accepted. That's where you find films that speak to you directly, as we are all different.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Romance"
Emotionally Powerful,"Watched on Netflix, never heard of a movie with zombies being able to change from the inside. Warm Bodies is a unique take on the immense zombie world in the film industry. When we think of zombies, usually it consists of cold blooded killers with no room for development besides becoming stronger zombies.The concept of zombies with the potentiali to re awaken due to human emotions is immense. Possibly a good reminder anyone could change if they had the right help and guidance.The violence and horror is still there yet the story is powerful enough to take the lead. Having characters take the lead to become better is always worth watching.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Romance"
"Ingenious, a zombie love story!","This is an ingenious work of art. One of the things that stuck out to me was the acting. Nicholas Hoult and Rob Corddry, along with the extras did an incredible job of depicting zombies that still have some vestiges of being human. They all did a great job of doing the ""zombie walk"".This movie is also funny. There weren't many moments that made me crack up, but the writers and the actors were able to maintain a consistent level of silliness throughout the film.Nicholas Hoult stole the show, and viewers can't help but fall in love with him as the film progresses. I feel like this film would have been a big hit if it would have been marketed heavier.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Romance"
You can't help but love it!,"When I first heard about this film it didn't really appeal but a friend watched it and told me how good it was so I gave it a go and I'm really glad I did! It's such an original story, a zombie love flick! Who'd have though it? It's not even a spoof, although it does have quite a few funny moments it does actually take itself quite seriously, the story really draws you in and you find yourself actually caring and rooting for 'R' (zombie lead character). I've never really been a fan of Nicholas Hoult, I guess I still picture him as that annoying little kid in About a Boy, but he plays this part really well and comes across as (I know this sounds daft) but a really adorable zombie! You can kinda compare this to Twilight, there are a few Twilight-esque moments in there, Terasa Palmer even looks like a blonde Bella but to be honest it's no bad thing and if your a Twilight fan you should give this a go, it's just as good if not more so just for its originality!",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Romance"
very good little movie,"I am surprised at the people on here saying they wanted to walk out of the theatre part way through the movie. I don't know, maybe some folks are so used to having someone else do their thinking for them they've forgotten how to and this movie does require you to think a little. The basic premise of the movie was pretty clear in the trailers so it wasn't to hard to work out what the movie was about really. It makes me think of the parents who took their kids to see Jurassic Park years ago and then complained that it was scary, ridiculous. Also I agree with previous posts on here saying if you walked out part way through your comments are not valid, that's like walking into a restaurant, smelling the cooking food then leaving and declaring it inedible.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Romance"
A Welcome to the Zombie Genre!,"Warm Bodies is an interesting and rather fresh entry into the tiring zombie genre. Despite lots of good entertainment, we really haven't been offered something new, not until this movie came along. It's more of a romantic comedy than a horror and the film is told from the perspective of the main zombie, R. This film is touching, sweet, gruesome, and action-packed. I think everyone from both genders will enjoy the film.Jonathan Levine's follow-up to his 2011's 50/50 is a radically different story, but still emotionally-infused. This film is about a zombie named R who develops love for this human girl named Julie. But if his love is to be protected, he must avoid being killed by the humans and even more undead creatures called Boneys.The acting is actually really good. Nicholas Hoult does a great job as R. Teresa Palmer is really good as Julie and both the actors have great chemistry with each other. Rob Corddry has many scene-stealing scenes as R's best friend, M. John Malkovich is rather restrained, but that's because of the source material.Overall, Warm Bodies is an excellent movie and so much better than expected. This isn't the Twilight of the zombie genre as many feared it was going to be. The romance is actually endearing and bearable. This film is funny, smart, action-packed, has good special effects and is a really sweet film. I rate this film 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Romance"
Just good entertainment with plenty of exceptional moments.,"This is a bias review because I bought the DVD and have subsequently watched it over a dozen times in the years that I have owned it.
There is no chance that anyone with a pulse couldn't like this movie, it is exceptionally well acted, has an exceptional soundtrack, marvelous sets, brilliant story and above everything else John Malkovich is in it!
The concept is truly original, probably the only movie of its kind to have a real conclusion that is as plausible as the initial cause, which by the way is only briefly mentioned but is totally superfluous as the movie carries the plot without it!
I personally believe that this movie should be up there in the 'classic zombie dramedy' list for anyone that enjoys light hearted humor along with a great and extremely well acted stories.
And then there is the soundtrack, oh my, whoever selected the music for the specific scenes deserves an award for their choices.
John Malkovich is never anything but a brilliant, talented and adaptable master of his craft and this fits in with the history associated with everything he has ever done. As convincing as possible with the hints of his personality thrown in as usual. By the way, even his small roles such as that in the Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy only he could have pulled off in the style that he did.
Overall, a brilliant movie with great music, however, not for the faint hearted as some of the scenes deny the younger viewers an opportunity to watch this.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Romance"
"Well made, original take on the zombie world.","Movie review:What an entertaining flick this was. I often don't start by saying this, but you should definitely see this movie. The story is about R (Nicholas Hoult) who is a zombie that is just plain sick of his mundane existence. Yes, you did read that right, the central character is a zombie. The zombie apocalypse has already occurred and the zombies quarantined outside of a walled in city just go about business as usual, wander around, groan, walk into things, the usual zombie like stuff. But R is different, he is lonely, bored and looking for companionship. The closest he has is a fellow zombie, M ( Rob Corddry).This of course is difficult because, well, he is a zombie. The audience is privy to what R is thinking which leads to some very amusing scenes from the very start. Well, like zombies often do, they get hungry, and need to travel to find food since they have already eaten everyone local to their area. When they set out for a search for humans, they run across a team from the city (that is run by the one and only John Malkovich) that is searching for pharmaceuticals. Well, in the zombie like feast, we learn that when a zombie eats a brain, he absorbs the victims memories, sort of like a daydream, and during the melee R attacks and eats the brain of our heroines boyfriend. Julie (Teresa Palmer), the aforementioned heroine, is saved by R and takes her back to where the zombies ""live"" In this time, R slowly develops a small vocabulary to try and communicate but of course, she is still at first terrified of him. But this is a romantic movie and the two begin to develop a strange sort of symbiotic relationship, hers is need to survive, his is desire. Now this is basically the meat of the movie, but there hasn't been an antagonist yet. Enter the bonies, zombies that are far to gone and have no feeling but hunger, so we can call them the really bad zombies, not the regular zombies. When the bonies realize that not only is a human (food) hanging around the zombies, but the zombies are slowly regaining more human like traits. So, like bad guys do, they go after R and Julie. By this point, R and Julie are ""friends"" and decide to warn the people of the city of the impending attack from the bonies and zombies alike (the ones that haven't started feeling). This movie plays out just so incredibly well, you may find yourself forgetting this is a zombie flick. Yet don't expect blood and gore, it is virtually non-existent. What does exist is an extremely original and well made movie that finds a way to excel where typical romantic movies fail, that is by making you believe in the characters so much, even under the ridiculous premise that it has and if you can look past that, you will absolutely adore this movie. Fine performances are turned in by Hoult and Palmer to make you really sympathize with the world they are stuck in. An excellent movie all around from slow moving amusement to a nice finale that will make you smile. 7.6/10 IMDb 7.1 My only gripe, I know they needed to use cgi, but it was pretty bad. I know, low budget. Very small gripe though. Thanks Bec for viewing this with me, it was nice to have someone in chat to laugh with, even if it was just typing LOL to halfway across the planet. Not very easy to watch a movie with someone when they are 15 hours ahead of ya. Timing is a b*tch.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Romance"

I remember leaving the cinema with a big smile on my face, surprised at how much I enjoyed it. The film is fun, humorous and has some nice parallels with Romeo and Juliet (main characters are R and Julie, you will notice some light connections throughout the film).
After finishing the film, I read the book by Isaac Marion and loved that too - The film absolutely does the book justice.
This film takes you on a journey and may have some moments you do not expect.

Breathing new life into this 'corpse' of a genre,"I don't want to mention Twilight, but, let's face it, it was 'vampires for teens,' just like Beautiful Creatures was 'witches for teens.' The 'teen market' is very profitable when it comes to film-making. Therefore, what with the trend in zombie movies in the last decade or so, it was only a matter of time before someone made a 'zombies for teens' movie.Amazingly, it's actually pretty good.It starts in a decimated world where the undead outnumber the living (nothing new there then, eh?). Only one - former teenage boy - zombie is starting to have 'feelings.' These remembered emotions lead him to make contact with the last few human survivors and strike up a friendship with a living girl.It plays out like Romeo and Juliet (check out the unsubtle nod to the Shakespearean play in the 'balcony scene') where the boys 'zombie family' don't take too kindly to a living human among them (that they can't eat) and the girl's human settlement doesn't relish the possibility of a brain-eating flesh-eater wandering among them.If you can move yourself out of the typical 'dumb' zombie world we're used to from George Romero and The Walking Dead etc and step into one where zombies can now talk, reason and even love, then you should give this one a go. It's not just for teens - zombie/horror fans like myself are treated to a healthy dose of gore and skeletons ripping people apart. There's a small helping of humour in it too and, on a personal level, I actually preferred the film when it was being an out and out comedy, but there's not too many laughs, so don't expect them coming thick and fast.In a market saturated by one rubbish zombie movie after the next, fair play to Warm Bodies for trying - and succeeding - in bringing something a little different to the genre.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Romance"

I always avoid watching any zombie movie, because it's so tiring have a fear that you're not safe anywhere, running all the time, avoiding anything, and the worse, you must kill someone you love because he or she is now a zombie. I think if I were in a situation where people change to be zombie, I would just give my hand to be bitten so no need to run anymore and all of us just be zombie. Hahaha...
So I think this movie is very different, quite delight, teenager's film that you can smile when watching a zombie movie. I liked World War Z because it's quite good ending for a zombie movie, but I think I just love this one. Finally zombies become humans again... Yeeay...",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Romance"

We get to see things through a zombie's POV!!!,"¨You miss himlike a boyfriendyou miss your boyfriend? ¨Jonathan Levine surprised me a couple of years ago with 50/50 and now he tries his luck on a very different genre in Warm Bodies. With the success of The Walking Dead television series the zombie genre is probably as popular as ever, but Levine does something different by turning things around. Instead of having us run away from the incoming brain eating zombies, he puts us inside their heads as we get to see things through a zombie's point of view. The main character's name is R and he is a zombie. We get to experience everything he is thinking as he narrates the film. This is probably what makes this film so fun and entertaining because we get to see this misunderstood zombie grunt and walk around so slowly while his mind processes things so quickly. Zombieland had already broken the predictability of the zombie genre by making fun of the premise, but Warm Bodies takes a different turn in that it makes the zombie one of the protagonists. These zombie eating villains might have a heart after all and we get to experience it in this romantic comedy. Nicholas Hoult, who is also the star of Jack the Giant Slayer, plays the leading zombie in a very funny way using a lot of physical comedy. The fact that he is given some very clever lines also helps this film. The screenplay was adapted by Levine himself from Isaac Marion's novel and it is very loosely based on the Rome and Juliet story (the balcony scene pays homage to that Shakespearean play). Teresa Palmer plays his human love interest with whom she shares great chemistry. She is very talented and the two make this film work thanks to some very funny moments and a touch of romance. Warm Bodies is really well paced and has a little bit of everything, combining comedy with romance and action. It is probably my favorite film of the year so far.In a near future zombies are now in the top of the food chain, and humans have been reduced to live inside closed walls. R (Nicholas Hoult) is a zombie living inside an airport with a bunch of other zombies. He seems to be a little tired of his daily routines which involve walking slowly around the airport, spending some time sitting around with his best friend M (Rob Corddry) just grunting at each other, and eventually going out to find something to eat. They have to eat, although they do feel guilty about it. R claims that eating a human brain is what makes them feel alive again as they can access the memories of that person. It is as close to feeling alive as they can ever get. One day they encounter a group of humans who are out looking for pharmaceutics. Julie (Teresa Palmer) is one of the members of the expedition along with her boyfriend, Perry (Dave Franco), and friend Nora (Analeigh Tipton). R ends up eating Perry and gets access to his memories. He ends up falling in love with Julie and decides to protect her from other zombies by spreading some blood over her face and asking her to remain still. R takes her to an abandoned plane inside the airport which he uses as his personal room full of items he collects including some records. R is a different kind of zombie, but this new connection he feels for Julie has made him feel more alive than ever. Not only R begins to feel alive again, but some of the other zombies seem to slowly be recovering their humanity. The problem is that Julie's father, Grigio (John Malkovich), is the general behind the closed walls that is determined to exterminate all the zombies and they are running out of time.The film is perfectly well paced with some memorably funny and clever moments. The film is funny, romantic, and lots of fun. Levine seems to know his craft and he uses this well known genre as a sort of parable to how through all the new technology we seem to be living as zombies and losing real human connections with each other. This film reminds us of the power of human connection, but that is just one point that Levine tries to get across without seeming to preachy. The film has some very funny performances and some great moments as well. This isn't a perfect film, and I probably enjoyed Zombieland a little more, but it definitely is a new spin on the zombie genre and it really worked for me. I have to give this movie a lot of credit for being so original and taking us inside the rotten mind of a brain eating zombie. Levine once again takes a huge risk here, but it really pays off nicely. One would never expect to be rooting for a lead character like this but you can't help but sympathize for this guy. I had a great time with Warm Bodies!http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Romance"
Really? Some of these reviewers don't seem to understand this movie at all.,"Some people complain that this movie is not a laugh a minute - well, that's because it's not a flat-out comedy.Some people complain that the story runs slow and loses steam - well, that's because this is not a flat-out action movie.Some people complain that there's no gore and a lack of danger to Julie from R - well, that's because this is not a flat-out horror/thriller.If you go in expecting a raucous comedy, you'll be disappointed, though it does have a lot of humor. If you go in expecting a zombie shooting action movie, you'll be disappointed, though it does have its share of action sequences. If you go in expecting a gory horror zombie thriller, you'll be disappointed, though it's not completely without gore or danger.If, on the other hand, you go in expecting an odd but ultimately sweet love story, with plenty of witty humor, a few action sequences and shootouts here and there, and an uplifting message about the human condition, then you'll be right on the money.That said, I did feel slightly disappointed that they left out some of my favorite scenes from the book, although I suppose those somewhat darker scenes wouldn't really fit in with the lighter tone they chose for the movie. And if you haven't read the book, you'll never know the difference anyway.In short: this is a greatly enjoyable movie, as long as you don't expect it to be things it isn't. But that goes for any movie - if you expect Iron Man to be a zany comedy, you'd also be disappointed.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Romance"
A refreshingly different kind of zombie film.,"R (Nicholas Hoult) is a zombie who spends his days shuffling aimlessly around an airport, snacking on the brains of any human who might stray across his path—but he hasn't lost all of his human qualities just yet: he still has interesting thoughts, can grunt the odd word to his zombie pal M (Rob Corddry), and enjoys listening to music.Julie (Teresa Palmer) is one of a handful of survivors who occupy the city behind the safety of a massive wall. When she takes part in a mission to the dead zone to find supplies, she comes under attack from zombies, but is saved by R, who—having just eaten her boyfriend's brains—begins to have feelings for the girl.With other zombies on the prowl, including the terrifying 'bonies' (the zombies who have deteriorated the most), R insists that Julie spends several days in the safety of his home, a deserted passenger jet; as R's feelings for Julie become stronger, he discovers that he is gradually becoming more human.Warm Bodies not only works well as a charming, unorthodox romance but also as a smart allegorical tale about how society has become dehumanized to the point where many people sleepwalk through life in a zombie-like state, glued to their mobile phones, only communicating via social media or experiencing life through other people's Facebook accounts. It is only when a spark is ignited by someone who is truly alive that a 'zombie' can begin the gradual journey back from the dead.With gentle comedy, romance, action, brain eating, AND social commentary, Warm Bodies is a welcome and innovative addition to the zombie genre that offers something to delight almost every demographic. Hoult, currently appearing in cinemas as war-boy Nux in Mad Max Fury Road, is on particularly fine-form, absolutely nailing the zombie routine. Who would have thought that that bowl-haired kid with the weird eyebrows from About A Boy would turn out to be such a star?",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Romance"
Warm hearts is more like it!,"(2013) Warm Bodies
SCIENCE-FICTION ROMANTIC DRAMA/ HORRORAdapted from a novel by Isaac Marion, co-written and directed by Jonathan Levine, and by looking at a title called ""Warm Bodies"" I thought it reminded me of a title for a porno movie but when you watch it, it's really the zombie equivalent of 'Romeo & Juliet' love story and uniquely original- another film that doesn't depict zombies as grotesque and disgusting things we often are accustomed to seeing. This can also be the kind of movie you can bring your date to. And people expecting plenty of 'blood and gore' or plenty of zombie killings, similar to ""Zombieland"" and ""Dawn Of The Dead"" will be very disappointed, since it centers on an evolving relationship between a zombie who calls himself ""R"" (Nicholas Hoult) and a young teenage girl named Julie (Teresa Palmer). It asks specific questions, such as can a zombie fall in love? Can this teenage girl love him back, despite the obstacles? Can her human friends accept this too, despite the odds being stacked up against them? All these questions and more would be answered. Written and directed by Jonathan Levine which starts off with a zombie who is unable to remember his name narrating his experience while being a zombie. And while he admits to eating people he doesn't know why. The only thing he does know is that when he eats peoples brains that he's also acquiring some of his victims memories as well which this entire scenario has never been shown before because it's shown from the zombie's point-of-view. At the other side of the story involves a huge percent of the population has already been consumed by zombies and it's depleting little by little every time because they often lack provisions. It's lead by Grigio (John Malkovich) who sometimes select and send a small group of people for, and it was during this time is when the two main characters meet for the very first time. And while this small reinforcement group is being killed zombie ""R"" manages to reach and gain Julie's trust, he vows to protect her on any circumstances since he's bringing her into the environment he knows. The main question is whether or not it can convince viewers whether or not this relationship can work, and the answer is yes, because it uses many scenes of 'subtlety'. Julie starts out being afraid and after we get to see what she sees by knowing him we begin to start accepting him and we too also want him to succeed. This is only the second film that uses the reverse psychology scenario that uses the idea about sympathizing with the zombies called ""ParaNormon"" and for awhile I couldn't believe what I was seeing from that film either.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Romance"
Lovelorn of the Dead.,"Surprisingly competent mix of paranormal romance and rumination on the ambiguity of who really is your enemy or ally.Given the very internal nature of R's journey, it is more than justified we should get some voice over narration and it all works. This is an atmospheric piece of post-apocalyptic story telling with individual internal rules regarding its zombies and really adds something to an otherwise tired subgenre.It's a bit insta-lovey but it sort of tries to justify it in an interesting way. The worst thing about it sadly the immensely bland female lead.Our lead is much better. He's funny, cynical, sympathetic I can believe he's the kind of cute boy your daughter jerks it too and all the zombies here look brilliant.It's a sentimental story but never in a way it doesn't earn. A lot of people probably assumed this was a variation of ""Twilight"" and although I don't hate that franchise, this is far more than the ""paranormal chick flick"" I suspect a lot of boyfriends assumed it would when they were dragged to see it.Well, I'm a boy too and I saw it alone so no sexism intended.This movie is a sort of high 7 or low 8 so I think I'll round it up because it masters a certain charm we haven't really seen in teen movies for a while.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Romance"

"A Fantastically, Well-made Zombie Dramedy Flick which Represents New Elements","Stating from the above summary title, that pretty much sums up what I thought of Warm Bodies. It wasn't my initial thought but when I went in and then walked out of it, I found that my perspective was of something I have just mentioned in the summary. Warm Bodies which is a modern take on of the Zombie sub-genre of Horror manages to pack quite a punch with its great acting and characters alongside it's excellent story and themes whilst showing us how good some Horror films can still be in this age today.One aspect of the film that I thought stood out was the ""About a Boy"" and ""Skins"" actor, Nicholas Holt. He was perfect for the role and for very good reason. *SPOLIER ALERTS* (If you haven't seen the film, please don't read on). He gives the character life in all aspects of his changing form into becoming human. On the other side of the spectrum, the reason that he gives this character a true nature and great entity of life is because of how he portrays him. He portrays him as a sympathetic character who tries to live with what he's got. I really enjoyed his performance because he put much effort into it so he could make it look as realistic, sympathetic and as creepy as possible. The other actors and actresses did a stunning job as well, but I still think Holt takes the medal here.One fact to touch upon is the CGI with those skeleton like beings. I wished that they had maybe used material or non computerized technology. That was a point or element which could have been more scary, however they decided to skip it. It wasn't a major issue but it just would have been good to not use CGI there.I thought the combined sequences of action, drama, horror and comedy alongside the vividly detailed, and well paced plot helped the film greatly to stay in touch with me as a viewer so I could care about what was happening with our main protagonists and what perils and dangerous situations they got themselves into.The element I found the most interesting and fascinating however in this modern zombie flick was how they treated the sub-genre. In many zombie films of the past which consist of Shaun of the Dead, Dawn of the Dead and Dead Snow, the zombie genre just continued to improve entities from before and become scary. At this moment, I'd say that Warm Bodies takes that place at enclosing and expressing the full entity of the sub genre. In the film, the zombies start to slowly turn human when they either eat human brains or have personal connections with the living. Later on throughout the film, Nicholas Holt's character ""R"", starts to fall asleep, have dreams and then finally bleeds. It really showed what the director was doing and where he wanted to take the direction of the zombie concepts and film in general. I believe that the aspects of a zombie slowly becoming human is a great one for the sub genre because it kicks new ideas to a whole new level now.Overall, I believe Warm Bodies is a film that shouldn't be missed in the cinemas. It's fun, it's bloody, it's beautiful, it's lovable, it's legendary in it's roots of the zombie genre and it's just damn creative. I highly recommend it. 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Romance"
Warm Bodies is a great romantic movie with an added twist of zombies,"""Warm Bodies"" successfully brings together comedy, romance, and zombies. Based on the novel by Isaac Marion, the movie tells the tale of zombies coming back to life through the power of love. While the whole story is very cheesy, it is still very entertaining. The story is told through the thoughts of R, describing the daily routines of a zombie who doesn't remember much of his past life.The acting in ""Warm Bodies"" is superb. Nicholas Hoult, who plays R, is excellent at portraying the quirky young zombie. His facial expressions really tell the whole story of the movie. It is amazing how much can be said without words. Julie, played by Teresa Palmer, is the tomboyish human love interest of R. Her emotions vary wildly, from the loving daddy's girl, to the emotionless zombie killer, and everywhere in between. The emotional interactions between the characters of R and Julie give a sense of realism, with Julie starting off terrified of her captor, but eventually trusting him to lead her to safety, and finally falling in love with him.The atmosphere of the movie is very dim. The broken down airport, the abandoned houses, and the depression era Hooverville appearance of the human settlement represent the deteriorating state of the world as it is overrun by zombies. Yet there are also scenes of open fields and sunny days that bring back the romantic side of the movie. The costumes and make up for the movie are all well done. Each zombie looks as if they have truly died, many with scars all over their bodies. Their clothes are all ripped and blood stained. There are also animated zombies, known as Bonies, that have their flesh peeled off. The animation done for these monsters is well done, including lifelike movements that instill fear. The humans, while not as bad as the zombies, also have an appearance of living a rough life.All of the concepts that make a good movie are present within this picture. ""Warm Bodies"" is a movie that contains a little bit of something for everybody, whether it is a romantic tale, a light hearted comedy, or an action filled zombie thriller. It is recommended to see this movie because no matter who you are, you will find something in it that you like.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Romance"
Ignore the bad reviews,"I must emphasize I was not a big fan of the zombie genre until the walking dead came along, and even that creeps me out a bit, but when I saw the trailer for this I was intrigued.I'm not going to bore you all with a complete rundown of this film, I'm just going to help you decide whether its the cinema or DVD.Both is the short answer, its one of those films you could watch over and over. It has lots of humor and lots of love, and not too much gore.It was also good to see Nicholas Hoult again, hadn't seen him since About a Boy, though he has done quite a lot since.So ignore all the bad reviews and let this movie take you on its journey, and let me tell you its a funny one.Enjoy.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Romance"
Socially Aware Allegory plus Zombies,"This movie seems like it could appeal to audience members looking for comedy, romance, or action. (If you're looking for a suspenseful horror movie you're gonna have a bad time.) While Warm Bodies offers a small bit of action, a few warm chuckles, and quite a bit of romance, it excels most as being a socially aware allegory that reaches out to a wide audience because of its incorporation of zombies, which seem to be big ticket sellers of todays pop culture. While the two main character's names, and a balcony scene, alludes to a certain Shakespearian play, the zombie's awkward behavior and inability to communicate with one another, the human's fear and hostility towards the zombies, the exclusive walled city the humans live in, and the dark, looming shadow of the ""bonies"" are all articles of a deep allegory which I can't really tell you about without using spoilers.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Romance"
"Weird premise, awesome movie","I have not read the book so I didn't quite know what to expect from a zombie meets girl love story, but I had heard good things so I decided to give it a shot. Which was definitely a great decision; I was laughing my head off from basically the first second of the movie. The story is an amazingly refreshing twist on the zombie genre; it totally flips the script. I had no idea how they were going to make a zombie come across as sympathetic, but the voice over element is genius and hilarious.Despite the obviously high-quality source material, the whole thing easily could have been a disaster if not for a brilliant performance from Nicholas Hoult, who plays the zombie protagonist simply known as R. Even with extremely restricted dialogue, facial expressions and body language, he still manages to convey an impressive range of emotions and elicit audience sympathy.In the interest of full disclosure I have to admit that I have been a huge fan of his ever since ""Skins""; anyone who has seen that show knows that Hoult is a fan-freaking-tastic dramatic actor, which is obvious in this movie as well. But I was even more impressed with his comedy chops; between him and Rob Corddry (who plays R's best zombie friend and is also amazing)I was cracking up all over the place.Also little miss Analeigh Tipton (who I will never not associate with America's Next Top Model, sorry) was super likable as the leading lady's best (human) friend Nora. Like, I don't even know if she is a good actor or not; she just has such a charming and magnetic personality that I want to be her BFF.Yes, John Malkovich obviously deserved more screen time and Dave Franco deserved less, in my opinion (which it pains me to admit, since I do love me some Franco), but the only real issue I had was with Teresa Palmer as the love interest Julie. Granted, she didn't have much to do besides act perplexed by R's strange, un-zombie-like behavior, but she basically struck me as a blonde Kristen Stewart, frowning and sighing and eyebrow-furrowing her way through the movie.This, by the way, is the one and only valid comparison between Warm Bodies and Twilight; despite any superficial similarities the two are not actually alike in any way so do not under any circumstances let that put you off, you'd be doing yourself a great disservice in avoiding this movie for that reason.So yeah, basically it's funny and poignant and suspenseful and a little bit creepy and a little bit cheesy, and basically just generally adorable. I loved it a lot and I think you probably will, too.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Romance"
Not a horror film girl but this is outstanding if you have a little imagination and humour,"Love love loved Nicholas Hoult in this film and his chemistry both with Teresa Palmer and with his fellow dead is outstanding. And Analeigh Tipton is just so relatable and fun. And the musical score is so well paired with the story.....Warm Bodies is a fascinating and clever hybrid that, at its best, manages to be funny, lyrical and yet reek with zombie gory. It is so not a typical Zombie film and if you don't like the sweet rising and the quirky humour elevating the charm, its not for you.This is my No 1 favourite ever Zombie movie and so exquisitely original. It has all the R&J feels without the heaviness - it has been coined Twilight with Zombies but this short-changes it, so much more.....",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Romance"
"Unique, fun, charming spin on horror/comedy tropes","Not since Zombieland has a horror/comedy been this much fun and charming. It was surprisingly poignant in some scenes and hilarious in others thanks to a sharp as a dagger adapted screenplay, from the novel by Isaac Marion. Jonathan Levine is on a winning streak and to me he is almost like a John Hughes of horror filmmaking as he seems so in touch with his viewing audience. The story combines in a well-balanced way with a star crossed lover's story, a zombie apocalyptic story and a comedy all wrapped up neatly in the most humane way possible. Warm Bodies is the first solid, wide released genre picture that cleanses away the bad after taste of the other genre bending horror efforts at the beginning of this year.The performances were chemistry filled and nails it so much better than the asinine Twilight films could ever do, thanks to a great director and his adapted screenplay. The film stars Australian beauty Teresa Palmer, who can still be mesmerizing even when she says nothing, she can probably have chemistry with just about anyone or thing. Teresa plays Julie, one of the surviving humans of a now dying and zombie infested world. When several zombies ambush Julie, her boyfriend Perry, played by James Franco little bro Dave Franco, and her best friend, played by charming and promising newcomer Analeigh Tipton, it results in the death of her boyfriend. Julie is now stuck with the zombies and loses contact with her friend and family. She has a change of heart when one of the zombies spares her and saves her from danger. Julie starts to form a connection with one of the zombies, R who is played to a tee by former child star Nicholas Hoult from About a Boy. Nicholas is establishing quite an impressive start so far a leading man. Who knew that a romantic horror/comedy with zombies can have such rich characters with a meaningful message, that if we all come together and unite we can make a positive change.Writer and Director, Jonathan Levin has made a breakthrough horror/comedy with Warm Bodies and hopefully more horror, genre bending efforts in the future. The was such a nice surprise considering that I had no hopes for it and zero interest in seeing it when I first heard about it. It's a shame that this film got such a better and fair release and start than his chopped up and deserted first effort, All of the Boys Love Mandy Lane, for which put Amber Heard on the map. Since his shaky start in 2006, Jonathan Levin finally gets his break with 50/50 and now Warm Bodies. Jonathan's talent as a director and writer is definitely relevant to today's culture and I can't wait to see his next handcrafted gem.Overall, Warm Bodies will touch you, make you squirm on the edge of your seat, make you laugh, liven your spirit and enlighten you with its thoughtfulness. Not too many horror/comedies have those abilities, making the film a potential cult classic in the making, a movie men and woman alike can sit down and enjoy together.

The Cutest Zombie Movie ever,"Well, how do i start. If this movie can be compared to any animated pixar movie then it would be Wall-E. This is no zombie horror flick that you watch every now and then. Talking about the cast; Nicholas Hoult is a perfect choice for a zombie like this. I don't think any other actor would have been able to potray this heartful zombie. His face was perfect for the role and had its own cuteness. The actress did her part very well too. Nothing in the movie seemed to be pushed hard. There was nothing stupid done. From the beginning till the end, it was a very grasping movie indeed. The screenplay and the editing is well done indeed. The entire transition from a zombie to a human shown in the movie is quite commendable. For emotional folks like me who cry in almost every movie, this is indeed a great movie for you to watch. All the things that the zombie did to gain the human's trust and to bond with them again; all these little things shown in the movie tell us that the director has done a great job. The director has shown various types of emotions all throughout the movie and has given a message that in the end ""love prevails"". Love has the power to change everything. No matter how bad you are, love can change you in no time. So, in the end all i would say is that please please please, watch this movie with anyone you love; your family, your girlfriend, whoever you want. Its a complete entertainer from the start to the end. And this movie is nothing like the normal zombie movies, this is truly different. A much better movie than expected. If you are on a date the this is a perfect movie for you to go to. The cutest zombie movie ever. My rating is 9 out of 10. Awesome Just Awesome. :)",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Romance"
Amazing movie!,"Warm Bodies is a smart, funny and touching film about a zombie named R who saves Julie from a zombie attack. It has great performances, a brilliant script and intelligent directing.First I need to talk about the two leads. I was a big fan of Teresa Palmer in I Am Number Four (underrated I think), where she showed that she could kick ass and take names. She still has an element of being tough in this movie, but the character is far more complex. She shows such a range of emotions that pull you in and make you fall in love with her as quickly as R does. Warm Bodies has been compared to Twilight (they were both made by Summit) and the criticisms that have been leveraged against the character of Bella (passive, submissive to Edward, not a good female role model etc.) are nowhere to be seen here. Julia is quite possibly the hero of the movie, but not by just being a 'male' character portrayed as a woman.Go to my blog for a full critique of the movie.http://mydreamtank.co.uk/",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Romance"

It is very witty, doesn't take itself too seriously and is full of great humour and clever parodies. Nicholas Hoult's acting is very good and really brings the audience along his journey.The movie also provides a very fresh perspective - the world from a zombie's eyes and shows us their side of the story, I haven't seen any other movie providing this perspective before. You could say the story is a little predictable but given such a fresh angle, and great written lines, the story catches you completely from start to end.Like most of the audience in the theatre, I laughed out loud countless times and thoroughly enjoyed the movie, walked away with big smile on my face and a warm feeling in my heart.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Romance"

Warm Bodies: A Zombie Love Story,"http://filmthroughmyeyes.blogspot.com/INTRO:On a bit of a zombie kick with this and the World War Z reviews, but hey I'm not complaining. Warm bodies is very much a different kind of zombie movie, a love story. I was skeptical of this movie turning out super corny or teen drama-ish, but luckily these stereotypes were avoided.ACTING:The film stars a few recognizable faces. Perry is played by James Franco's little brother David Franco. R is played by Nicholas Hoult who was Jack from Jack the Giant Slayer and Beast from X-Men: First Class. Rob Corddry plays M. He has been in various movies from Hot Tub Time Machine, Blades of Glory, and What Happens in Vegas. Julie's father is played by the one and only John Malkovich from Burn After Readng and many other films.Julie is played by a stunningly, gorgeous Teresa Palmer who was in I am Number Four and The Grudge 2. She looks like a mix between Hayden Panettiere and a blonde Kristen Stewart. Palmer throws in a great acting performance as Julie. She plays a very dynamic character ranging from the serious, broken hearted version of Julie to a the newly love struck Julie at the end of the movie. Julie is a strong willed character throughout the entirety of the film.Palmer's male lead co-star, Nicholas Hoult, also delivers a fabulous acting performance as R. Playing a member of the undead who is the main character is hard enough. Showing zero emotion is more difficult than it sounds, but the audience watched the slow development of Hoult's character grow throughout the entire movie. Hoult executes this progression effortlessly and seamlessly.Overall, all the acting is pretty spot on in this movie. The great makeup artistry of the film crew aided this as well as the costume work. The disheveled zombie look was nailed on the head.TAKEAWAYS:The uniqueness of the film adds in new dynamics previously never explored in a zombie film. There are numerous laugh out loud moments that keep the audience involved with the awkwardness of a human, zombie relationship. The puns are placed perfectly and the stereotypes are executed just crafty enough to not seem corny yet remain humorous. The premise sounded strange, but Jonathan Levine, the director of 50/50, executed the movie flawlessly to combine a chick-flick (I hate this title because not only do I enjoy most of them and it's just another gender role stereotype that limits societies outlook), love story with a comedic variant of a zombie movie.I'm putting this on my must see movie list. I highly recommend you see this movie in whatever manner you'd like: Netflix, Redbox, actually buying it, etc... I can say that I'll be watching this movie again sometime soon to introduce it to others.One of my favorite movies of the year.RATING:The film gets 4/5 Chuck Norris thumbs ups.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Romance"
Unique Zom-Com,"A zom-com set post-apocalypse, when the world is what it isWhilst comedic, with elements of laugh-out-loud humour, it is the warmth of the romantic thread that gives a new touch I've not seen in other movies, and adds something almost warm-and-fuzzy to the otherwise obviously Zombified laughsThat the infected could be affected, is not something you really think about...

Feel the magic of the bodies getting warmer!,"On the wave of hits like ""Twilight"" and similar unconventional and impossible love stories involving different worlds, ""Warm Bodies"" is a sweet tale on the love between a human and a zombie both living on an apocalyptical world. It's about zombie R (Nicholas Hoult) and human Julie Grigio (Teresa Palmer) and how one saved the other's life amidst the conflict between their species and the Bonies, horrific and dangerous creatures more powerful than the zombies itself, slow in movement and speech and reduced to strange groans.It all started when R noticed the girl while they were under human attack and he end up killing her boyfriend (Dave Franco) yet saving her from being attacked by his own zombie friends. At first she doesn't understand his reasons since he can only mutter words, the most he can say is ""Not safe"". But since she's the daughter of the human's resistance leader (John Malkovich), a tough colonel, she needs to go back to the stadium where the few human survivors are based, at the same time R notices changes on his deteriorated condition, now capable of doing more human things like dreaming, expressing his thoughts in a better way and more. And now? Love and trust trying to survive in a shattered world that is about to face more conflicts and perils.What's underlined such simple story? True love and true respect that doesn't see appearances but sees actions, it's all about what's inside and not what's outside. It's different, it's far from the usual, you get suspicious but you try to know the other one and discover the world others have to offer. It seeks union in the difference, even at its most awkward. A good call to its target audience (teens) and the way they perceive changes and go through them. Invisible to majorities, sometimes alone in crowds, walking around like zombies and only getting truly noticed when they like someone, love, friendship or any kind of bond. Just a way to put it, not necessarily an universal truth, but appropriate.Easy going, profound and far from being corny like many of same traits, ""Warm Bodies"" manages to be better than its original source, Isaac Marion's novel (good yet depressing), not betraying his intentions, changing a little here and there but being a little funnier. But they should have stick with Sinatra's songs (changed for obvious reasons but replaced by Springsteen and Guns N' Roses, equally great in my book) and also present R's zombie family and his adopted kids.Relatively impossible to happen but please, give Nicholas an award for his role in here. The first of its kind, here's an unusual zombie, one that invites you to his world and deeper thoughts, one you create an enormous empathy even when he kills people to survive. He was the perfect R, in movements, expressions, actions, reflections and all and we get a bonus because he's incredibly funny and charming while being an awkward and good-looking zombie. Palmer was a good companion to him, and Malkovich played a good antagonist but Rob Corddry steals the show from time to time as M, R's best friend. Interesting to see him playing a more restrained character, a little amusing, different from the loud characters he plays.One of the year's most entertaining films, greatly presented and acted, humorous and romantic despite the minor horror in it. 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Romance"

What would happen if we were less indifferent and afraid of each other?,"You have to decide. You can chose to be someone better than who you are, or you can give up and be a walking corpse. You can either help, or stand in the way. These are the core ideas Warm Bodies is built around.Personally, I love extended metaphors, all the better when they're written as a comedy/horror.If you've read this far, you know what the movie is about. What I want to tell you is how good the performances are and tell you that when the zombies don't live up to the rules they laid out, that it ties back to that central theme.If you watch this -- I hope you do -- remember that this is the first zombie film that isn't a statement about consumerism or retribution for everything humanity has gotten wrong, rather it's a film that says we have within us the ability to change the world even after the apocalypse.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Romance"
Hollywood knows its audience,"This movie should not have earned its budget back. But it did, and then some. Why? Because despite the weak story, the horrible script and the spotty acting, Hollywood knew what spice to add to this undesirable dish in order to make it palatable.
Their method was simple: make it look good and make it sound good. To this purpose, they first added a decent repertoire of songs, masquerading as a soundtrack, a tasteless but effective touch. They then proceeded in adding some product placement, namely a veteran actor, an up and coming star and a pair of the most mesmerizing baby blues to come out of Australia this century. Oh and there was a BMW thrown in there for good measure, and better profit.
Lastly, the ever popular, but often overlooked secret ingredients of filmography: the light tone and the standard romance. After all, there's nothing about a zombie apocalypse that can break the spirit and take the fun out of Armageddon. Oh and nothing in the world can possibly stop love, not even differing species.In conclusion, Hollywood might have forgotten how to make good movies, but they'll never forget how to sell their products. As for this latest effort, I say, rejoice in the positives. The movie has enough of them to make it watchable.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Romance"
Very very good,This is going to be a very short review.This film was excellent i thought. I seen it advertised and thought it would be a refreshing twist on the zombie genre of film and it was.It was very entertaining from start to finish and i felt actually sorry for the corpses in the film at times.

Humorous Zombie romantic comedy,"After watching this movie I was keen to log on to IMDb to write up my review but now that I have seen so many reviews on here that basically cover most of what I wanted to say, I'll try and keep it brief. My expectation was not high as I don't particularly like the lead actor Nicholas Hoult, however a wry smile appeared on my face within a moment or two of the movie starting. Zombie movies are ten a penny and we all pretty much know what to expect. This is a little off the beaten track and it doesn't take very long to work out it's direction, however I found that this didn't distract me from the movie and settled in nicely to see how it would progress. No spoilers here but suffice to say movies are all about entertainment and this one entertained me thoroughly. I enjoyed this immensely, while some of the special effects could have been better, the direction was thoughtful and visuals not overly dark. For an offbeat zombie this is a watcher even if you don't wish to own it. Miss is and miss out!.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Romance"
Great movie!,"This movie contains booth horror and lots of love, great for couples and everyone who has the age required for this movie :)The Boy ""R"" meets a lovely girl when she and a ""team"" are looking for medicines for the human camp. People with hearts, zombies and bones which have been zombies for so long that they can't become human again. If the movie should have been any better I think another actor would fit the role as dad in this movie better. The role is well played by John Malkovich, but not well enough. The movie also have other weaknesses as it is too overdone in the way of editing special effects.Great movie overall and sometimes touching, I give it therefore 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Romance"
Www.. www... Whoa! Something new to me,"The first word I tried to utter while watching this, was: Www www whoa. Warm Bodies (WB) is nothing like any typical Zombie movies that I've seen before. The film stands out because it is told from the perspective of a Zombie. And it shows that even these walking-dead could still have some human characteristics, despite the need to eat people.The Apocalypse world in WB is survived by three groups: Humans, Zombies and Bonies. Zombies who have lost humanity and any bits of hope would shed their own flesh and become Bonies. Bonies, as the name suggests, are nasty skeletal figures who prey on anything that has a heartbeat.The film is based on a novel by Isaac Marion which bears the same name. I highly respect the originality of humanistic nature of Zombies in Marion's ideas. The film starts off with the protagonist named R (a young ambitious Zombie-lad) wandering in an airport, while narrating to us his daily routine such as communicating (grunts and moans, actually) with his best friend M, hoarding, and listening to vinyl records.One day, while touring to the City with his packs of Zombie friends, they bumped (attacked, actually) into a group of humans seeking some medicines in a pharmacy. There, R met a pretty hot girl named Julie, among others. It's love at first sight! The story goes on, developing the relationship between R and Julie.When my sister said (and showed the trailer) about the bizarre elements of this film, it enticed the curiosity in me. Thus, I've set my mind to be as open as possible, and regard this as a light-watching. Man, I never thought I'd be this thrilled and satisfied! Perhaps because it's been so long since I've last watched any romantic-comedy genre.Seriously, some of the scenes are like damn funny. You would grin at the very least. And the l'amour. Sigh. The story gives you many hints of Romeo and Juliet references. Just look at the names R and Julie for starters. Chick flick? Nahhh, I wouldn't be as mean to label this as that. But rest assured, it's not Twilight.The cast gave their best. Nicholas Hoult (R) and Teresa Palmer (Julie) had this sweet chemistry. Rob Corddry plays M while Dave Franco and Analeigh Tripton acted as Julie's boyfriend and best friend respectively. And with John Malkovich as Julie's father, you could expect his wittiness coloring the film.WB has this awesome soundtrack too. I dare say the music and score help the success of this film. I personally love Bruce Springsteen's Hungry Heart! It's one of those song that would stuck into your head, and you'd reminiscent the scene over and over. Just check out the videos in YouTube, and you'd see many people thanked Warm Bodies in making them searching for the selected song(s).My only problem, a slight one, is the appearance of Bonies. Looks very computer-generated. But hey, the film is not that serious (deviate from orthodox Zombie-rules), so I tend to get over that. The plot is superb, and at the end, well, it's wonderful. Needless to say, WB becomes one of those movies that I'd recommend my friends to watch when they come over.Verdict: Rrrrrrrrrr Read my last sentence above.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Romance"

"Surprisingly Refreshing, Funny, and Heartfelt","When I first heard the premise of Warm Bodies, I thought that it could be a serious flop. However, I was pleasantly surprised to find that my initial thoughts were completely wrong. This film has a refreshing plot that is really quite different than anything else I have seen. Not only is it quirky and extremely funny it places, but it also carries a great message of open-mindedness and acceptance. It has a romantic storyline that keeps the viewer rooting for the two lead roles the entire movie, who both happen to have great chemistry together. They keep the romance quite lively (hardy har har). Strange as it feels at first, you find yourself hoping the zombie gets his girl.I found Warm Bodies to be very entertaining, and quite charming.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Romance"
Interesting Movie,"Warm Bodies is a modern sci-fi ""horror"" iteration of the classic Shakespeare work of Romeo and Juliet. The term ""horror"" can be very loosely used; the majority of the movie follows an awkward romance scene and the scary parts are few and far between. Don't be fooled! There are a few jump scares. Clearly, the biggest allusions to Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet are the characters names, the feuding houses now the feuding populations, and even the story's progression. The similarities are clear enough, but Warm bodies is unique enough to stand as its own story. However, the ending differs greatly with the couple living happily ever after (more or less). This is a nod to its modern approach and setting where audiences are much more receptive to a happy ending. The film is overall a great watch and can be enjoyed without any background literary knowledge.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Romance"

Sympathy for the Zombies,"8.3 of 10. Original zombie horror/comedy seeing the world from a zombie's point of view.While there's furiously beating hearts and affection, it's too simple to call this a romantic comedy that just happens to involves zombies. It is truly a zombie horror film that just happens to involve comedy and young adult, 20-something attraction.While there are zombie comedies (Zombieland & Zombie Strippers being the only other ones that are not pure nonsense), and brief comedic/satirical elements in some of the more complete films (Land of the Dead (2005), Resident Evil), the only film that seems somewhat similar to this is Woke Up Dead. The Zombie POV and different stages of zombies give it something unique to zombie films even without the comedy/love.While the film is not perfect (narration, zombie speed inconsistency, and the soundtrack is like someone stuck in the 1980s), its failing moments detract only temporarily, the acting is consistently real, and there are logical new answers to why zombies snack on brains.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Romance"

Best (color) Zombie Movie I've seen,"A wicked sense of humor elevates this movie but the other aspects are all strong, too. Evil monsters called 'The Bonies' are genuinely scary, the comedy is funny (and well hidden in parts) the drama and love story are convincing.If you like 'An American Werewolf In London' then you'll like this.My hopes were low... I don't like zombie movies and teen flicks just annoy me, but the opening narrative from the leading man soon had me in a different mood altogether.Highly intelligent script, comedic timing and a superb direction are the icing on the cake. Much funnier than (the massively over-rated) Shaun Of The Dead.The irony of R (Nicholas Hoult) looking at a magazine with Kim Kardashian on the cover with a confused expression on his 'Edward Scissorhands' face is priceless. But I have a feeling that it's intent will fly above the heads of it's intended audience....and finally, a shout out for the terrific sound track. Any movie that finds time for a classic Bob Dylan track (Shelter From The Storm) is all right by me, and there are another 20 or so audio clips that were all funny, appropriate and most importantly of all...

"I really like this entry of Twilight, unlike its predecessors, it has heart, and even Kristen Stewart seems to be alive! Whatdifferent movie? Oh that's a relief!","""Don't be creepy, Don't be creepy, Don't be creepy"" Yes, be creepy, and funny and do your thing, after all you and the girl are probably the same age, but, what about you being a Zombie? Sorry, I got caught on the moment and forgot I suppose to review this movie that unfortunately, avoided for quite a while. Because of the poster and the awful marketing, I thought it was another stupid flick directed just to young audiences and not to people like me, that ask more brains (no pun intended) in a movie. The zombie in question, ""R"" is the kind of zombie that maybe under the right circumstances you would like to have as a friend. I have been following the career of Nicholas Hoult, since ""About a boy"", and I am really glad that he will be in ""Dark Places"" one of my favorite books, (Believe it or not I predicted that one day the movie would be made). So as you can see the casting of this movie is as good as it can get and as a bonus we get to see the always welcome John Malkovich, and Teresa Palmer, whom I haven't really paid much attention before, and she has the acting skills that what's her face? Doesn't have, As Julie, Teresa made me smile, then giggle and finally laugh and completely care about her character. The chemistry between this very weird pair made of this silly movie, a fun-love-story, and the soundtrack, Oh man, awesome!

Who says zombies are heartless?,"Initially, I never really gave a thought for Warm Bodies until last week, when I read the book in a day, and immediately went out and bought the DVD afterwards. And I was very, very glad I did.It's such a fresh and original take on the zombie genre. Up until now, I'd only ever seen zombies be brainless (pardon the pun), moaning and groaning, absolute dehumanised... things, really, and never a film from the perspective of the zombie them self. And yes, these zombies moan and groan too, but it's either funny (case in point, R and M's ""almost conversations""), or endearing when concerning R (is it weird to find a groan endearing?)Nevertheless, R, played brilliantly by Nicholas Hoult, really is an endearing character. He's a zombie with a conscience - which is such an oxymoron that it's brilliant - which enables him to behave a little different to the rest. As his dialogue (not including the voice over) is minimal, we're mostly left to rely on his facial expressions for prompts, which I think Nicholas does so down to a T. His eyes say a lot. And I liked seeing his character develop, thanks to his interaction with Julie (played by Teresa Palmer). The relationship between the two mains is sweet, but not over done. And I think they're both capable enough in themselves that neither of them ever seems ""weak"" - vulnerable, yes, but not weak. The chemistry between the two is nice as well. The scenes with them in the plane I thought were especially good. The voice-over was a nice touch, because without it, well, we'd be a little lost between moans and groans until things begin to develop a little later on. It's also pretty humorous, and helps to lighten the atmosphere of the film as a whole, I think.It's clever, too. There are deeper issues to this film that render it with a good sense of substance. The social commentary included that shows the zombies are really only what they are because of their loss of their own humanity. I loved the symbolism. And personally, I liked the homage paid to Romeo and Juliet.I really enjoyed this movie, and it stays relatively true to the book, which is great. I would have liked to have seen more scenes translated from book to film, but I understand that obviously, not everything can be included.One of my favourite films of 2013, so far.

The feel good movie of 2013!,"The feel good movie of the year .......... and it's a Zombie film. Based upon the book by Isaac Marion, this film tells the story about how one Zombie Apocalypse actually has a cure, but what is it? Our main character is a zombie, appropriately named ""R"" (Nicholas Hoult ), because he can't remember what his real name is, begins to change back to normal after running into the beautiful and understanding Julie (Teresa Palmer). Not sure if its love or plain old understanding and teaching that helps the zombies come back to human, but the feelings are there and you don't care why they are getting better. They just are and it makes for a terrific story. It does feel like Twilight (2008), ala' zombies, but who cares.Another aspect of this particular Zombie Apocalypse is the new idea that when a zombie reaches a certain stage of their ""evolution"", to the fact that they give up all hope, they then undergo a transformation and turn into ""bonies"". They become living (or non-living), engines of destruction with no reason, just pure killing. Also Julie's father (John Malkovich), is the leader of the post-apocalyptic city where all of this is taking place and he vows to kill every dead being around him. What develops is a very cute story that is playful and is also a commentary on certain prejudices that plague the real-world and shows us that understanding and love can make us all get together and help each other.The fact that this is a romantic comedy and that the idea of a ""change-back"" is happening helps the film-makers (Directed by: Jonathan Levine), get around a lot of the classic zombie lore and you don't complain that zombies don't do this or that. I did not read the book, but a friend told me that the film-makers took a lot of the gore out of the book so they would have more time to explore the ""love-story"". What is happening to everyone and the changes that are occurring, made me think that was a very smart move. I felt good after seeing this film.8.6 (B+ MyGrade) = 8 IMDB",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Romance"
R by any other name...,"Okay. Just finished Warm Bodies. It wasn't until the balcony scene that we really put it together.

That actually made it better because at first, we weren't lovin' it. But now, I can give it at least 3 stars and even 4 for that connection and the performances of ALL (did I mention John Malkovich???). So a good, solid 4 for Netflix and 7 or 8 on IMDb.

Also didn't help that Teresa Palmer really reminds me of Kirsten Stewart for some reason. However, within the first 5 minutes, you realize that the movie doesn't plan to go down that road. R's inner dialogue was hilarious and this was more of an off-beat comedy than a romance. That being said, the relationship between R and Julie was really cute and innocent. Sure, it started a little unconventionally, but it was strong enough to literally change the world. Nicholas Hoult is just too adorable as R. His mannerisms, facial expressions and inner monologue are great. Don't judge a movie by its trailer I guess. The story is simple and the miracle at the end is not really explained, but hey.

The music was perfect, blended into every scene, and was truly meaningful. Zombies communicating their feelings to living humans through old records was brilliant, and the rest of the score amazingly relevant at every scene.

Near perfect,"Very rarely do I come across movies that I can call ""personifications of myself"". Let's be honest, it's a once in a lifetime thing- to know that if you as a personality, were to be converted into a movie, it would be *this* one.
Except that's how I feel about Warm Bodies. It's got EVERYTHING- horror as a first impression, humor as a second, with a subtle hint at romance, all cooked together and served with a sprinkling of the feeling that none of this should work together, but somehow it does, and it is beautiful!
I bet even Gordon Ramsay wouldn't yell at you if you served him a helping of this movie :p

Different from the classic zombie movie,"This film is certainly different from the classic zombie films because a sweeter and '' human '' vision of the zombies is undertaken in it. The plot is original for the zombie theme but if taken alone it is quite banal and very disheartened. Overall though, this is a good movie that manages to fully entertain the viewer from start to finish.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Romance"
loved it,"I didn't think It was gonna be as good as it was ... looked like a Zombie version of Twilight actually and i was prepared to be a lil cringed ..... (and was trying to figure out how Zombies can actually be Hot or Unlike Vampires have feelings/ Emotions or have a relationship with someone ""Human"" well after watching shows like Walking Dead and Resident Evil .. thats all the idea we really get that zombies areBut was a great Movie and def funny in parts .. I took my 10 yr old nephew whos a Walking dead / Zombie fan .. and thought that he wouldn't like it as much as it was touted as a zombie ""romance"" but he loved it and said was soo funny !! some classic lines but the cast and wasn't too scary for kids (but wouldn't take anyone under 10 to it) but still had enough gore for us action fans and the romance was sweet enough to be there but not full on like twilight (like Love declared within 20 mins of the movie) def recommend plan to see it again too :)",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Romance"
"Funny, cute and different","A quite different take on the zombie theme. On the surface a dumb and dumber premise but artfully handled and nice allusions to Zombie lit, Shakespeare and world politics. This film is often surprisingly beautifully shot with some nicely understated CGI and even more understated humour (even if occasionally borrowing from Shaun of the Dead...but who could resist?).Not rip roaring laughs but delicate film making meshed with dumb zombie humour in a way that somehow works. Overall premise seems a bit cheesy but supported by the film's metaphor of accepting/understanding others ... difficult when someone wants your brains.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Romance"
Pleasantly Surprised,"I like English movies and didn't really research the film before I saw it, I just knew Nicholas Hoult was in it so assumed it was English.Imagine my dismay when the opening scene was Nicholas Hoult putting on quite possibly the worst American accent I've ever heard. Nails to a chalkboard is quite fitting.However, it got less annoying as the film went on, mainly due to his dialogue really. You'll see when you watch it, I won't give anything away.I didn't really understand the whole zombie thing if I'm honest. To me it seemed like a last minute idea to make a romance movie a little more exciting. You could re-write the entire storyline around street gangs, Vampires, Werewolves, Witches, High schoolers or Supermarket workers really and it would still fit.I think the rash of dire zombie movies out recently probably spawned the idea off.That being said, I really enjoyed the film for what it was. It's well written, very well acted and no real major plot flaws. I expected it to be another low rent B movie like all other horrors that seem to be creeping out of the woodwork recently.I've given Warm Bodies an 8 out of 10. Would have been 10 but the make-up for the zombies wasn't great. Nicholas Hoults accent, hair and chin put me off full marks too.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Romance"
Romeo and Juliet...with zombies!,"Don't be fooled. ""Warm Bodies"" is not some syrupy teen romance brimming with tears, angst and regret. This film is artfully done, brilliantly acted and directed, and really, really good. It is by turns exciting, funny, thrilling, and touching. It is literally a modern remix of Shakespeare's ""Romeo and Juliet,"" told from the perspective of ""R,"" a young man recently killed and zombified, but who still retains a glimmer of human consciousness. He cannot remember his name, only his first initial, ""R."" During a hunting raid in the city as a part of a zombie pack, R kills and eats the brains of a young hunk, and gains his victim's memories. While envisioning these memories, he realizes the young hunk had a hot girlfriend named...Julie. R (the word ""Romeo"" is never uttered in the film) starts to feel strange feelings he thought were impossible. Instead of killing and eating Julie, R is overwhelmed with a sudden surge of protectiveness, and rescues her from the zombie horde. His sudden alliance with a living human sets in motion a chain reaction of events that just might change a world decimated by plague. I'm only scratching the surface. You owe it to yourself to see this film, which I believe was Nicholas Hoult's first.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Romance"
A Successful Out of Box Effort,"I was never.. never a zombie movie fan. It has always been a plot that I could not digest. Initially, I had the Jack and the Giant Slayer in my mind when I planned to go for a movie. However, one thing let to another I found myself convincing my family members to go for this movie instead. Perhaps the trailer that my brother showed me some months ago played a huge part in it. This zombie movie was nothing like any other zombie movies that I have watched. It was an unusual plot - very different and was presented in a way that was so enjoyable. Kudos to Isaac Marion for a creative thinking and Jonathan Levine for a powerful narration. Despite some scenes of discomfort (which i accepted as after all it is a zombie movie) it was largely entertaining. I also found the movie quite hilarious especially the scenes where we get to hear the inner voice of R. Nicholas Hoult played his part brilliantly meanwhile Teresa Palmer captures our heart with her beauty just the way she has made the zombie feel in the movie. The supporting characters made their presents felt too. So, take my word for it - this one is a good one!",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Romance"

A great film. Very different from those zombie films.,"I didn't know this movie until a friend posted on Facebook that this film is kind of a great film. So, I watched it.This one is very much different from those movies I watched. It's unusual that the lead character is a zombie. I mean normally, directors make films from humans' points of view. They never make anything from a zombie's point of view. But in this film, you'll see it's difference.Changing the point of view makes the film very different and very good to enjoy. Some people get tired of zombie films because every time they see is that zombies are bitting people and people are killing them. But in this film, you'll get the new taste which is one of the best thing of this film.The actors and actresses' performances are very good. I totally love them. Because of their awesome performances, this film becomes better and better.As time passed, we all forget how much old films are good. And some people don't watch films that are over three years old. But this film is better than some films produced in 2018. All in all, the film is flawless and very enjoyable. I recommend you to give it a try. You might not regret watching it.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Romance"
"Fun, Intelligent, warm love story (w/ the undead)","I was very pleasantly surprised and had fun watching this movie. Think Wall-E with humans and the undead instead of robots. Warm Bodies is an intelligent, warm love story that includes themes of redemption and interpersonal communication. The simple but effective Romeo and Juliet type plot is well crafted, the actors do a very good job, and it is directed flawlessly. The soundtrack is one of the best I've ever heard. A good candidate for those couples who can't agree on a chick flick or a horror movie. It may sound silly, but you might spend a little time thinking about how you relate to those around you after watching this movie.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Romance"
"Funny, charming and even somewhat thoughtful","I decided to watch Warm Bodies because of the funny and fast paced trailer, which suggested something like Zombieland + Romance. The movie turned out quite differently: It was of much slower pacing than expected and only featured a few uninspired and generic action scenes, but in my opinion it scored quite high in other fields.The characters, humans and zombies alike, were very likable and have been performed convincingly. The general sentiment of the movie was warm and kind and, although always on the edge of stereotyped cliché, never overdoing it. The characters showed some development and i really enjoyed the growing romance between the two main protagonists. Fortunately the cautious borrowing from Romeo & Juliet was integrated nicely into the movie and not striking in your face, like in some other recent productions.I wouldn't go as far as to say that this movie was deep or ambitious, but it featured some interesting themes like ""wandering around, not knowing why or where to go"", ""looking behind the surface"" or some spot on zombificated versions of real life romance / relationship building.One of the best ""young adult"" romantic comedies currently around and it really strikes out of the all those other one-dimensional and superficial movies of that genre.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Romance"

I didn't expect to be that good.,"Teresa Palmer is gorgeous. Anyway...I was hesitant to watch this movie because it had to do with 'Zombies' and I typically hate anything to do with them. Boy was I wrong about this movie. It started out slow but just kept getting better and better, which is something I love in a movie. The characters were very interesting from the get-go and the plot-line was intriguing also. I just went through the whole movie with this thought like 'This movie isn't going to be much good', and it just kept proving me wrong at every turn. The acting is great, effects are great, atmosphere is great. Teresa Palmer is gorgeous.So by the end I found myself thinking, 'what did I just see?'. One of the best movies of the it's year is what I saw. I would recommend this movie to anyone of any age. It's just great.Also did I mention Teresa Palmer is gorgeous?

"""Warm Bodies"" is a flawed but entertaining mix of ""Night of the Living Dead,"" humor, and romance","Zombie movies are a dime a dozen right now. This charming little mix of action, horror, and a love story changes things up a bit. It provides a satisfying experience, yet left me surprised there wasn't more funny parts.""Warm Bodies"" tells the tale of a zombie named R (Nicholas Hoult). R spends his days wandering through an airport aimlessly. One day he saves a girl named Julie (Teresa Palmer) from an attack by the walking dead. The two become unlikely friends, which appears to restore R's humanity over time. Have they discovered a way to bring the zombie masses back to life?As a whole, ""Warm Bodies"" works. I have to say I was expecting more humor than I got. While it was funny, it fell short of delivering the grins trailers promised. Director / Writer Jonathan Levine did a great job with creating a bond between the two lead characters. However, Julie accepts the fact that R ate her boyfriend way too casually.The zombie carnage and gory imagery isn't downplayed anywhere near as much as one would expect in an adaptation of a young adult novel rated PG-13. There's plenty of scenes of the living dead eating dinner. Creatures called ""Bonies"" also offer a higher level of horror than what one would expect from a zombie romance / comedy.Although ""Warm Bodies"" doesn't deliver the laughs I was expecting, it's still an entertaining and warm film. It's a less campy and more serious mix of 1993's ""My Boyfriend's Back"" and ""I Am Legend."" There's something for horror fans and romantics to enjoy in this movie.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Romance"
I like it,"I was looking forward to this since the moment I saw the trailer and so got myself out of bed for the 10:05 am showing on opening day. It looked funny, like 'Shaun of the Dead,' and seemed to have its own interesting take, which is rare in the zombie genre. Usually the plots of zombie films are about as aimless as the zombies. The best way to describe this film is a zombie romantic comedy. It does have some action and some tense moments later on but the initial set up is the zombie, R's, emotional growth and how meeting this girl sparks something in him to evolve. This is nothing like 'Twilight,' and those that are saying that have either not seen it or are too absorbed in the fact that the two leads are good looking, which is the only commonality this film has with 'Twilight.'But, let's face it, the majority of leads in films are attractive, so, that's not much to base a similarity on. 'Shaun of the Dead' was just a comedy, where this is a comedy with heart and depth. It's a satire, but they don't force feed the point of the film, instead they make it very subtle, which is nice.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Romance"
Awesome movie!!!,"Funny, I was going to watch ""Cloud Atlas"" as a ""transformational"" movie and then watch this as entertainment. I decided to go straight to the entertainment and I think it had a great and healing message and I had fun too! I love seeing Nick Hoult! He did a great job! Even John Malkovich seemed normal-ish!It's a romance so it is a movie about love and unconditional love and going for it with your heart, even when you don't one! I liked that the CG stuff wasn't overdone so the movie had an organic feel. This added to the realism in the movie. SO many movies now days don't integrate their CG well and it ends up looking cartoon like where it should not. All in all, a very enjoyable movie!",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Romance"
What this movie really is about,"I'm a 29 year old guy who truly despises Twilight movies and everything alike. Warm Bodies was none of that. Twilight is a movie tailor made for idealistic teenage girls who know nothing about real life. Warm bodies is tailor made for intelligent and cynical people who have some knowledge of psychology and politics...The key to understand this movie is to overlook the zombie aspect. The zombie apocalypse is just a metaphor for the dehumanization of our society. The Zombies are just normal apathetic people, who walk through their lives without ever being truly human. They are like the teenagers of today who can only send text messages to each others, or play on their Iphones, or the bureaucrat who can't bother to greet you properly when you go and renew your driver license...They can only «eat a brain» to feel, by stealing other people's thoughts. Which is a metaphor that means that they have no original thoughts, they try to be someone else. They are people who are not themselves, people who are slaves to the thoughts of other people, who cannot be «free».In the beginning of the movie, R walks in the airport, goes through a metal detector with a TSA zombie who is still doing his job, not unlike an actual TSA worker... As R describes his «life»; walking around, not talking to anyone, looking at the ground,stuck in his own little bubble, he wonders how things were before the Zombie Apocalypse... And the next scene shows that things were EXACTLY THE SAME before...Then comes the girl, who truly is alive. She is a true human being. She listens to no one but herself, she truly is free (from herself). The apathetic, emotionally dead young man, upon seeing her, begins to feel again. Anyone who has been emotionally dead at some point in his-her life, and then experienced true love, can relate to that.The reality of our time is that about 85% of the population is brain- dead and emotionally drained to the point where they are basically non- human. Modern society destroyed us. A lot of those people were good kids, who could feel, who could love, but modern life got through them. Many just feel hopeless, they would love nothing more than to be human again. Others, are just plain scum, they have no more souls, they cannot be saved.This movie was pure genius.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Romance"
Heartwarming,"In Warm Bodies the world is in shambles, the population is split between the zombies, the skeletons, and the humans. Julie seeks refuge outside the bubble of existence and gets in a bit a trouble, only to befriend a zombie who takes a liking to her. This unexpected adventure seeks to understand the divide between the living and the dead. Some good intense scenes and with John Malkovich, you are taken on a wild naughty adventure. It gives new meaning to the old maxim ""can't we simply get along?"" The movie does a good job of making light the often serious consequences of turning into a zombie. It also showcases how youth is wasted on the young and sometimes they see what their elders fail to admit.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Romance"
"Feel Love, Feel Warm!!","To begin with ...It is the craziest idea, to cure zombies with love, but well hats-off to the team to make it believable, everyone, from director to actors did their job nicely.Story - Its crazy, refreshing and adorable.Acting - Nice, everybody is almost good.Direction - Amazing, it wasn't slow, and didn't miss out any front (emotional or thrill) you may not like it only if you think love is lame.Verdict - Its a movie wroth watching, and can be enjoyed with everyone (not with kids of course), well i loved it!!",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Romance"
Oddball zombie thriller has found a winning formula,"Nicholas Hoult also stars in a sci-fi thriller called Equals (2016) with Kristen Stewart. Here, with Teresa Palmer in 2013, I found an odd similarity between the two, as both are love affairs. Equals is a regimented, sterile society with space travel, whereas Warm Bodies is an enclave and hard and gritty with zombies outside, but both stories are somewhat Romeo and Juliet. I wonder if one was the inspiration for the other. Warm Bodies has high production values. There is good cgi throughout, and as they have gone to the expense of using good cgi for some of the zombies, this movie has managed, in my mind at least, to jump from just another nod to cult popularity, to the true realms of really good sci-fi movie-making. Breathtaking backdrops on a scale like I Am Legend enhance the apocalypse vision here. I had to tag a point for never quite commanding the line between oddball (romance) and serious (apocalypse), as well as at least one minor flaw in the story. Aside from that I found it one of those movies that aims to get better, both visually and in terms of excitement, as the story progresses. This is a really good zombie film, and one where, even if you aren't a fan of zombies, you may just find yourself enjoying it.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Romance"
plot and opinion,"Considered to be a science fiction film, warm bodies was directed by Jonathan Levine in January 2013. Starring Nicholas Hoult a R, and Teresa palmer as Julie, the leader of the survivor's daughter, whose father hates zombies. After an apocalypse in the USA, the survivors live in a city surrounded by tall and thick walls for protection. Julie, among others, is sent on a mission on the outside, where the group is attacked by zombies. R eats Julie's boyfriend's brain, gets all his memories and falls for her. He saves the girl from the other zombies and hides her in the plane where he lives. They develop a relationship and become friends. Soon the zombies change their emotions and are capable to dream, but the Bonnies, the evil zombies, are after Julie and R. The movie has incredible special effects and very realistic make up and costumes. It also has excellent performances. It's a fantastic film to enjoy in family. This film appeals to sci- fi lovers and zombie fans, though it also has romance and adventure as well as action. It's a film recommended to everyone, young and old.",,Anonymous,"Horror, Romance"
Warm indeed,"""A romantic-zombie-comedy-drama-thing? Uh no thanks"" I said when I heard about this, and I kept saying ""nah, I won't see that"" for months. Shame on you past self! While utterly predictable this movie is funny (as in I laughed out loud several times), sweet and generally warm.The plot is simple, inspired by the old tale of forbidden love (more specifically, Shakespeare, but we can all agree he didn't make up that concept) and as such isn't very interesting, but R's jokes (and perhaps, my love for Nicholas Hoult)are funny and the post-apocalyptic setting is a nice backdrop. It is a tale of love and hope and I enjoyed it a lot, and know that others will too if they get past the whole ""zombie falls for human"" part, which I didn't until someone told me to. If you need a light, funny, hopeful movies then give it a go, you can always turn it off if you hate it.",,Anonymous,"Horror, Romance"
Cute and unique but not memorable,"This movie is a unique take on the zombie genre but requires us to look over a lot of plot holes and character motivations.The main leads are cute and have a good chemistry between them but the dialogue and plot is quite generic.The addition of John Malkovich is baffling because it could have very well been any other old male actor. I feel like his acting skills were kind of wasted in this film.The romance is cute and this movie is probably the only film other than Shaun of the Dead to make me feel for the zombies.The antagonists could have been developed further to represent hopelessness and loneliness but they are unfortunately wasted with a simple, hungry and boney creature.",,Anonymous,"Horror, Romance"
