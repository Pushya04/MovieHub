I get the point,"Vulgar, disgusting, hilarious and brilliant all rolled into one.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
A graphic religious allegory (and not for kids),"Nothing in the trailers will prepare you for this movie, including what it's actually about. SAUSAGE PARTY is an allegory about religion and how ridiculous it is, but also about how we can overcome our differences and learn to get along. Granted, there is no solution proposed nor does the humor rarely rise above obvious sexual puns and stereotypes (different foods represent ethnic groups, minorities, etc.), but the throw-everything-at-the-wall approach guarantees that at least some of it sticks. And importantly, for a comedy, there are plenty of genuine laughs to be had. Then there's the ending, which I will not spoil. Suffice it to say that it seemed oddly appropriate...and that you can get away with quite a bit more in an animated film than live-action. This wasn't the craziest or funniest thing I've ever seen, but it made for a few dollars and a couple hours well-spent.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
The fact that this film was greenlit is a cause for celebration,"Sausage Party, the latest button-pusher from Seth Rogen and his usual crew, has so far grossed $135 million on a $19 million budget, receiving mainly positive reviews from critics and assisted by strong word-of-mouth thanks to a climactic scene which won't allow you to look at a hot dog in quite the same way again. Essentially a movie about anthropomorphic, sexually repressed food items who long to escape the confines of their supermarket home to reach the 'Great Beyond' - taken home by us humans - Sausage Party is a mixed bag. On one hand, it's a bold religious parable featuring some extremely creative animation, but on the other, at least comedy wise, this is on par with some of Rogen's most mediocre output.In a supermarket named Shopwell's, the various tasty treats that line the shelves spend their days praying they will be picked and taken to the great unknown by shoppers, who they view as gods. Each morning starts with a sing-a-long, and they try to live their life by a set of rules they believe will led to them being chosen, including no sex until they're out of their packet. Hot dog Frank (Rogen) only allows himself to touch tips with the bun he's in love with, Brenda (Kristen Wiig), saving themselves for the inevitable day when they get carried off into paradise. But with the return of Honey Mustard (Danny McBride), who claims that he witnessed torture and horror at the hands of the 'gods' who devoured some of his friends, Frank sets off on a journey of discovery and awakening.Similar in many ways to Pixar's Toy Story trilogy, Sausage Party imagines what it would be like if the food we consume to eagerly could talk to each other and wonders what they would make of us. But while Woody and co. would flop to the ground whenever a human walked in the room, the characters here exist in the 'fourth dimension', unseen by humans. This allows more freedom for directors Greg Tiernan and Conrad Vernon to deliver as many outlandish set pieces as they would like, and two scenes in particular - one inspired by Saving Private Ryan (1998) and the other featuring an Irish potato being skinned alive while his friends watch - are actually quite terrifying. The film is certainly at its best during these moments, and there are scenes of real ingenuity amongst the carnage.The first half whizzes by and is a blast, but then the film seems to lose direction and wander aimlessly from one scene to another. It also struggles to tickle the funny bone, and relies too heavily on tired food puns, familiar shtick from the likes of James Franco, Jonah Hill, Michael Cera, Paul Rudd and Bill Hader, and outright vulgarity. Someone should point out to the writers - which include Rogen and regular collaborator Evan Goldberg - that using ""f**k"" every other word doesn't automatically make a film 'adult', but quickly becomes unpleasant and completely unnecessary, especially when the characters are otherwise perfectly likable. Also, the inclusion of Douche (Nick Kroll), the cavity-cleaner who holds a grudge against Frank, serves only a distraction from the more interesting central plot.Still, despite its many flaws and irritating tics, I very much enjoyed Sausage Party for what it is, and it's like nothing I've ever seen before. If you haven't enjoyed much of Rogen's previous output, chances are you won't love Sausage Party, although there's plenty of visual splendour to savour in between the d**k jokes. At its best, it offers interesting parallels to real-world issues, such as the relationship between a lavash named Kareem (David Krumholtz) and a bagel named Sammy (Edward Norton doing a pitch-perfect Woody Allen impression), and their bickering over shelf space. Of course, this is the edible version of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and while it may embrace comedic stereotyping throughout, Sausage Party never intends to offend, and instead offers a surprisingly sympathetic message about the necessity of religion. Whatever your view, the fact that a film like this can be greenlit and unleashed on a mainstream audience is cause for celebration.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
An enjoyable send up of Disney Pixar films,"Sausage Party is an adult CGI animated comedy film. I'm a big fan of Disney Pixar animated movies and this film is a fun and enjoyable parody of them. Even though the humour sometimes felt forced, the film's message of self-discovery is what I believe holds it up.At ""Shopwell's"" supermarket, all the anthropomorphic groceries on sale dream of one day being picked by customers to be taken to their new homes. However, some of the groceries soon learn the terrible truth of what happens to them once they have been purchased by humans. A sausage named Frank (voiced by Seth Rogen) attempts to warn his fellow Shopwell's grocery items of their inevitable fate before it is too late.Filled to the brim with crude jokes and political incorrectness, Sausage Party is an enjoyable send up of Disney Pixar films. The animation was nice to look at and definitely on par with most of today's CGI animated features. The jokes didn't always work, but the ones that did had me laughing out loud. This film is not for the easily offended and definitely not for children, but if you enjoy the comedy of Seth Rogen and his stoner buddies, then I recommend seeing it.I rate it 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Vulgar, Crass and Incredibly Funny","Sausage Party is a foul, crass, mean-spirited little film that pits grocery products against the horrifying realization that their use in this world is to be consumed and tossed away without a second thought. Centering on a courtship between a sausage named Frank (Rogen) and a hot dog bun named Brenda (Wiig), the very fact that the discontented ten year old in all of us didn't just giggle at the thought of how they consummate their love is enough proof that this film is juvenile. Yet despite leaning, nudging and winking towards the least discerning of low-brow audiences, Sausage Party is funny enough to have people rolling in the aisles, smart enough to lend itself to cogent meta-commentary and vulgar enough to live in teenage-screen-hopping infamy. Make no mistake, this film is the brass ring, the real deal, the funniest film you're likely to see this year and given this year in comedy, I say it's about damn time.Before the events of Sausage Party, Brenda and Frank live inside their separate packages; Frank being partnered with friends Carl (Hill) and the diminutive Barry (Cera) among others. Every morning, the denizens of Shopwell sing a song of joy while they lay in waiting for a benevolent god (human) to choose them and take them to the ""great beyond"". Failure to be chosen, or worse dropped on the floor, means produce is to be thrown away in a seemingly bottomless abyss of a grocery store garbage bin. Frank and Brenda however like their chances. It's a few days till red, white and blue day; what could go wrong? One returned container of Honey Mustard (McBride) who forecasts doom is what can go wrong. That and a particularly testy Douche (Kroll) angered by a grocery cart accident that sullies his chances to be useful.As an animation, Sausage Party is artfully, colorfully and simplistically rendered. Each section of the grocery store lights up with a look and feel that compliments the local produce. After the doors close the Mexican food area resembles a rustic western cantina, the cookware section beams with the silvery glow of shimmering straight edges and the alcohol aisle is just one big rave. Environments outside the store are limited yet realistically depict the kitchen of a prim housewife and the dingy living room of a bugged out druggie. The less I tell you about the brief street scene, the better. Overall, it's obvious there were limitations in the budget yet if compared to the similarly themed Foodfight! (2012), this film's animation is an artistic triumph.The embedded oddness of the story lends itself to some pretty unique and funny jokes. Ones that hit the funny-bones of all not easily offended or grossed out. Such highlights include a bagel (Norton) and a lavash (Krumholtz) arguing about having to share an aisle, a Grits (Robinson) package being misplaced by ""dirty good-for-nothing' crackers,"" and legions of sourkraut looking to exterminate the juice. Needless to say there are times when the film get's lost in the tall grass with over-broad ethnic stereotypes (A Native American liquor bottle named Firewater certainly ranks among the most egregious). But let's face it, if you're sold on the premise of a R- Rated animated comedy about food-stuffs you probably won't be too concerned.Sausage Party is a funny, funny, funny movie that doesn't just hand in shock value laughs for the sake of shock value laughs. It's also a well-created hero's journey with something to say and avoids all the pratfalls of modern comedy by A: not relying on broad improvisational humor and B: lands that third act like it's its b***h! Speaking of which: don't take your kids to go see Sausage Party. This is not the film you can harangue ""cool mom"" points with, seriously. Keep those little tykes at bay at least until their old enough to purchase their own heroin syringes.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Hilarious, raunchy and, yes, cleverly written","After watching Sausage Party, one thing is certain - You will never look at your food the same way again. In this film, Rogen and Co. employ all their humorous tricks in the book to bring to life a highly original idea. Along for the ride are fellow comedic gems including Jonah Hill, James Franco and Kristen Wiig to boot.The film tells the story of a world of anthropomorphized food in the fictional grocery store Shopwellers. Life is great for all the food items, whose dreams are to meet the ""gods"" and to (relish?) the life outside their confined shelves. But when Frank the sausage learns the truth of their fate as human meals, he must warn the rest of the food items and find a way to escape and find their elusive freedom, free from humans.The plot sounds ridiculous and it is even more over the top than one might expect it to be, especially those last 30 minutes or so. The amount of crude humour and constant innuendos keep its free flowing story a hilarious one. But for a film that centres around food, there exists a great level humanity embedded in its plethora of characters, who are as endearing as they are vulgar, filled with the same urges, ambitions and fears that any normal person would have.With its constant food puns and raunchy humour, it certainly isn't for everyone. But Sausage Party is special - it offers both humour and substance, some food for thought if you will. It has an extraordinary charm stemming from its lovable characters and occasional nuanced moments. A seemingly shallow storyline delves much deeper into the concept of religion, hope and perspective. The idea is highly original and provides a surprising dose of pathos and provoking moments.An 'ate'/10 for me.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Nihilistic, uninspired, and predictable.","Seth believes in absolutely nothing, and it shows. This is a man who seemingly only gets his kicks from making the viewer's lip curl in disgust. Vulgar for the sake of being vulgar, this is the film equivalent of a teenage boy who just learned the F word. Morality aside, the movie is cringeworthy, hard to watch garbage. Don't even watch it ironically.",1.0,Anonymous,Animation
It's More Than What You Expect It To Be,"I was moderately interested in this film just from looking at one trailer; I was open to the vulgarity of the film, but I didn't think it would be as good as it was.The theme of the film and the delivery is genius by my rating.The base of it's humor is sexual jokes, blunt insult and passive aggressive sarcasm; so if it isn't in your taste then you clearly won't enjoy it. I highly suggest to avoid taking younger viewers. The film delivers to both those that enjoy the immature types of humor and those that like the sophisticated hidden humor (you have to have some base knowledge to understand the jokes).The reason for the high rating is the films use of personification; if you're well educated in the sense that you understand different cultures then you'll definitely laugh at some point.The plot isn't all that great as it's a search for knowledge type so the searching part is what is typically hard to illustrate in films. All in all, this watch could be added to your itinerary and compliment an easy going night.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
why are there so many bad reviews?,"This film was genuinely funny. What's the problem? That the film questions religious beliefs? Or that it makes references to previous and modern-day conflicts? Or was it the profanity? I like to think that well-placed swear words only add substance and make us feel alive. I abhor films that use ""gosh darn it"" or ""friggin'"" or some other avoidables. Say it like you mean it. I was thoroughly impressed by how the film managed to assign a backstory to each product, in line with their country/region of origin. There are so many details I am sure I overlooked that I will definitely have see it at least a couple of more times.Good job, guys.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Definitely an Original Comedy,"Say what you want about this movie but at the very least acknowledge that this is a creative story. Sausage Party is about a sausage that learns the true fate of all the food that resides at Shopwell. He must convince his girlfriend as well as everyone else the truth before it is too late. While all of this is going on a douche wants to seek revenge on the sausage and his girlfriend.There is not much of an intriguing plot to the story. What the movie does have is many funny gags and jokes to keep the viewer entertained throughout. These jokes are however pretty dirty and vulgar and will make you think ""did he just say that?"". This movie is certainly not for kids or adults who dislike heavy amounts of violence and sex in their movies. This movie also really focuses on religion to the point where you are about to say enough, we get it. It didn't get under my skin like so many other reviewers on this site. I still found myself enjoying most of the banter though.This movie will offend a lot of people much like Seth Macfarlane's projects. If you enjoy shows like Family Guy and American Dad you will definitely really enjoy this movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Wurst movie ever made,"This movie should have been buried quietly where it could do no harm but unfortunately it was something of a success. It manages to be nastily offensive to just about everybody without ever once being funny, and the scenes of violence, rape and fornication amongst food products make it horror rather than comedy. Watching the whole abomination will cause PTSD in any normal person.",1.0,Anonymous,Animation
Best comedy of 2016,It's vulgar. Over the top. And completely hilarious. It even has a serious message about religion and why we are here. Anyone that says this movie is not funny does not have a sense of humor. I never write reviews but this movie was just to funny to see people on here claiming it's not. They just broke new ground for a genre with adult animation. Why not? I'm tired of all animation being just kid movies. Easily best comedy of the year. I hope they make a sequel because I think it will be even better knowing they did something outstanding. Every character has its funny moment. I loved nick roll as the douche and Danny mcbrides honey mustard. I'd like to see mcbrides with a bigger part in the next one because he is just too funny. Krumholtz as lavish was awesome. I believe it will be even funnier a second viewing. And the final 20 minutes there is a scene so bizarre and hilarious the fact it's animation is just awesome,10.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Crude Comedy, but Original Spin. It hits the target audience","The mission, write a review. The movie: Sausage Party. Robbie K here, and I'm back with another assignment to give you the 411 on the latest movies to hit the theater. Tonight the latest animated ""masterpiece"" is my subject, one crafted by the masters of raunchy comedy. Let's get started.LIKES:  Originality  Clever writing with wit  Killer Soundtrack  Short run timeIf the trailers weren't enough to convince you, then let me assure you that Sausage Party certainly is a more unique film than most. The idea of food coming to life and navigating a supermarket is not something we get these days. Add on the sexual characteristics and personify to add depth to their characters brings even more shine to the movie. I mean making an antagonist who is an actual douche is new to me.And with originality often comes cleverness, which this movie manages to bring to the mix. There are plenty of movie references and stereotypical humor integrated into the movie, much of which is well times to have you laughing in your seats. I myself enjoyed seeing warzones unfold in Saving Private Ryan manners, or seeing science fiction movie plots breaking into the spot light. But most of you are probably looking for the sexual innuendos promised in the trailers and to your relief it delivers on its promise. The focus of the movie is certainly on promiscuous side with so many descriptions for sex jammed into the 90 minute run time. So many people lost it to the aggressive insults and descriptions for genitalia that it was sometimes hard to hear the movie. There were also plenty of cheesy puns thrown into the mix to relieve some of the dirtier comedy. And for the moments where they broke the fourth wallthat too was a very good choice.While you certainly don't care about soundtracks in a comedy movie, Sausage Party gets points for the songs they chose. Various classics over the last few decades grace the speakers such as Three Dog Night's Joy to the World, Meatloaf's song (sung by a meatloaf) and a few other tracks to fit into the deranged mood. It's fun, flashy, and a nostalgic twist to only amplify the comedy of this film and well placed throughout the movie. And did I mention that it is only 90 minutes long. A perfect run time to get the message across before going into the overdone territory.DISLIKES  Disturbing  Jokes that cross the line  Some lazy dialogue  Some tactics that went staleIf you didn't catch the trailers you might have missed some of the more graphic scenes of the movie. Seeing perishable characters be brutally dismembered while hearing screams of despair, anguish, and suffering drowning the theater certainly wasn't the most enjoyable thing to see. Some might find the destruction of food laughable, but the presentation was a bit more disturbing to me than anything. But these fail in comparison to some of the violent fates other characters fall into. Despite the corny, comical theme, those who cringe or feint of heart might want to steel themselves for the chaos at hand. And as for the orgy scenes, well seeing food do it really isn't my cup of tea. But if death and violence aren't enough to cross the line, then perhaps some of the more inappropriate jokes will do it for you. Our writers certainly set out to poke various snakes, making fun of various cultural references that had me sometimes laughing and other times wondering who it will set off. Surely many people will find this movie offensive, especially when customs and traditions are adulterated with sex and monogamy. I won't lie I laughed at it sometimes, but some of the things certainly hit below the belt. Throw in some lazy dialogue moments and you add further insult. Why cursing must become the key ingredient in a comedy, I don't know, but nevertheless Sausage Party doesn't hesitate to haphazardly add swearing to the point of getting annoying. As for jokes growing stale, surprisingly it doesn't happen much in this movie, but there are some gags that lose their punch. Random food popping up at their mentioning is one example, arrogant bragging of the douche was another. To their benefit though, the jokes were pretty well spread out and the short time prevented them from going too overboard with some of the jokes.VERDICT:It's hard to score this movie as it isn't the comedy I might prefer. However, keeping in mind its intended audience and joke style, I have to say the movie certainly delivers on its promise to be sexually slanderous and mind numbingly stupid. The story certainly isn't the greatest (or that strong to be honest), but this tale is certainly original in many ways and so creative. However, all the insults and disturbing moments, not too mention the cheaper, low key dialogue moments, take away things for me. So who do I recommend this movie for? Fans of Seth Rogen movies, those who can't get enough raunchy humor, or those who want to see food do it. Worth a trip to the theater? I have to say it is for the audience it delivers for, but hold out until the RedBox if you can wait.My scores: Animation/Adventure/Comedy: 7.5 Movie Overall: 5",,Anonymous,Animation
Very Funny,"I was shocked how much I had fun with this movie. I usually don't enjoy Seth Rogen/Evan Goldberg comedies, but this movie was much more unique. While there was still raunchy and drug humor throughout the movie, the combination of this and the animation made it even more hilarious. The voice cast was surprisingly great. Even though the voices are noticeable, it fit well with the character they were playing. One of my favorites was Bill Hader voicing a Native American –type alcohol bottle. The things that happen throughout the movie are so strange that I could not believe what I was witnessing. The ending of this film was easily the most I've laugh this year. Anyways, this movie is not for everyone. The film is a bit stupid, but that's intentional. The film did not have as much laugh-out-loud moments as I wanted, but that is not really the movies fault. The trailers gave away so much funny bits in the movie, that the hype for the movie would have never been met. But, overall I had a great time with this movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Uh. It was, interesting.","I thought the movie was funny, love all the actors. But I have to say, I was pretty disturbed and as soon as I left the movies I went home and they made tacos which was even more disturbing then I originally thought. So as I am eating my taco, I wanted to throw up but laugh at the same time. I don't really know how to feel about this movie then say it was interesting. Not something you see everyday. Still can't look at food the same way just yet but you know, I'm getting there. Hot dogs were already ruined for me when I ate a moldy hot dog one time. No harm done there. It was quite an interesting movie.. Thanks for the laugh and the vomit still coming out of my mouth. You're the real MVP.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Uproarious Vulgarity and the Search for Higher Purpose,"""Brilliant"" is a word too loosely used, but the sidesplitting and deceptively cerebral ""Sausage Party"" is exactly that, as intense raunchiness is leveraged to skewer self-assured beliefism in what is one of film's greatest yet most derided satires.Every character in ""Sausage Party"" is a food item at a grocery store. And each wants to be purchased, sharing a belief that a higher purpose awaits beyond their limited shelf lives. What a brilliant metaphor for our own need to perceive something greater in store beyond what our life expectancies offer.Bringing together the disparate concepts of outrageously sexualized humor with the search for higher purpose is what plants ""Sausage Party"" firmly on the short list of film's most aspirational satires. - (Was this review of use to you?

A Funny Wonderful Journey To Seek Out The Truth,"I recently seen this hilarious comedy piece at my local theater and i would say that i didn't regret it. Seth Rogen( as well as most of the cast list) is already well known comedians. The movie was never a bore to me (there were some slow parts, but there was always surprises) and it's a great movie if you've ever watched The Night Before, 50/50, or Super Bad. What i found interesting was that Greg Tiernan (Directed Thomas & Friends) and Conrad Vernon (directed Shrek) made this film look so kid friendly and delighting to watch at the start, and then just really made it raunchy, disturbingly obscene, and utterly hilarious that it was without the doubt the best change-up for a beginning of a rated R animated film. It really does deserve a rating of 7, without a doubt it's as funny as it looks on TV previews, but it's even more shocking once you watch it. Now, there is many parts where it did get a little slow and not all of the jokes were funny, nor did everything run its course like other ""kid-friendly"" animated films, but it did do a good job at explaining the question, ""What would it look like if food had human personalities and were conscious of their surroundings?"" So in the end would i recommend this film to watch at home with your eight year old child? Hell no i wouldn't, but when you're at home or want to watch something funny and new then this is the movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
It's like a Disney film on acid,"I knew what to expect going in to this, coming from the insane minds of Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg. I saw the trailer, and thought to myself this is gonna be one insane ride. When I came out of The Secret Life of Pets with my mom and my nephew, saw the poster to Sausage Party, I told my mom ""Don't be fooled by the poster, that is not a kids movie"".The story speaks the insanity for itself, about food in a grocery store, and that is all I'm gonna tell ya. The animation is top notch, spoofing those Pixar films. The actors really do voice there characters well. Seth Rogen really brings his humor well to his role has a hot dog. If your not a fan of vulgar humor, and gross out gags, then you should probably avoid this like the plague, cause this pulls no punches, it goes straight for the throat. It was very funny, there is perfect timing to all of the gags. It's not a masterpiece, but just a fun time for fans of this type of humor. Expect nothing or less.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

Also, just read what it's about!Giving a movie bad reviews because you're too clueless to recognize that this is an adult film is just, in my opinion, lazy parenting.It's not fair to the movie that people review it poorly based on that.Watch this movie for what it is, a very funny & crass ADULT film.

Should Seth Rogen Write Children's Movies? Let's Take a Look at The New Raunchy Comedy Sausage Party!,"Should Seth Rogen Write Children's Movies? Let's Take a Look at The New Raunchy Comedy Sausage Party!IS THIS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU GET STONED WHILE WATCHING CLOUDY WITH A CHANCE OF MEATBALLS?!Life is good for all the food items that occupy the shelves at the local supermarket. Frank, played by Seth Rogen (Knocked Up, Neighbors) is the hot dog, Brenda, played by Kristen Wiig (Bridesmaids, 2016's Ghostbusters) is the hot dog bun, Teresa Taco, played by Salma Hayek (Frida, Everly) and Sammy Bagel Jr. played by Edward Norton (Fight Club, American History X) can't wait to go home with a happy customer, because they see human beings as Gods. Soon, their world comes crashing down as poor Frank learns the horrifying truth that he will eventually become a tasty mouth watering meal. After warning his pals about their similar fate, the panicked perishables devise a plan to escape from their human enemies. Sausage Party is raunchy, rowdy, completely insane, and an animated blast at the theater.Once again, we have the entire Seth Rogen entourage returning in this movie. We have James Franco (Fly Boys, Pineapple Express), Jonah Hill (Superbad, 21 Jump Street), Michael Cera (Superbad, This is the End), Danny McBride (Your Highness, This is the End), Paul Rudd (The 40 Year Old Virgin, Ant-Man), Bill Hader (Superbad, Trainwreck), Craig Robinson (Knocked Up This is the End), David Krumholtz (The Santa Clause, The Judge), and Nick Kroll (Get Him to the Greek, Dinner for Schmucks) . They all do exceptional voices, especially Bill Hader.From the opening scene, you are already on edge, smiling, giggling, and you soon find yourself busting your gut and spilling laughter. It was such a funny and clever opening. Especially if you know how a majority of children's animation movies open. The directors of this movie are Conrad Vernon (Shrek 2, Puss in Boots) and Greg Tiernan. So these two know how to craft an exceptional animated film, and once again, they proof to us they can do it again.LET'S SPOON! FORK OFF!Even though this film is offensive, foul, use a ton of profanity, it actually is thought provoking, entertaining, funny, and has a message to its audience. The movie actually does get a little emotional and mentally deep. For instance, how is peanut butter made without the death of peanuts? How is jelly made when you murder grapes? What makes us who we are? Etc. This movie had me laughing aloud when I first saw the trailer. On the other hand, the actual film is trying to show us a message. A message about religion, God(s), race, politics, history, war, separation, poking fun at Disney movies, stereotypes, how and what we consume in our bodies for fuel, health, and I'm sure there are a lot more I may have missed. You gather all these themes, put them in an R rated animated film and you get Sausage Party (even though our main character Frank is a hot dog).TOO MUCH MUSTARD ON THAT ONEThe movie was not consistently laugh aloud funny as if I thought it would be. After a while, the profanity got a little stale. Yes, I understand a hot dog saying f#ck is funny, but they could have toned it down. In addition, the movie gets a little too wrapped up in the message it wants to share with the viewer(s) at times. One thing I personally found awkward, was it felt like the movie kept reminding us we are in an R rated animated film. FOOD FIGHT!Accordingly, the film starts to show us more of this world. We start to realize it's not just food that is alive. Condoms, bathroom supplies, and other objects come to life as well. I really felt bad for toilet paper. In the film, a hot dog asks toilet paper, ""What do they (the humans) do to you?"" Toilet paper responds, ""You don't want to f#cking know."" At this point, this is when the food and other objects get together to fight the humans, and fight for what they believe in.So these are my final Bitchin' Buddha thoughts on Sausage Party. I enjoyed the film, I thought it was smart, had a message, and made for good entertainment. Some of the jokes do fall a little flat, and get old. Nevertheless, they make up for it in so many clever ways. Please if you have children do not take them to see this movie! Unless you want your child to have a panic attack in the middle of a Publix. I believe Sausage Party earns7 Sausages Out of 10!his review is brought to you by Boogie Buddha, and remember, don't just get down, but get Boogie. Thank you all for reading, and or viewing, and I hope you all have an amazing day as always. :)",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Leave The Kiddies At Home And Let The Good Times Roll,"Surprisingly clever adult animated film. It is offensive, racist, crude, sexist, and low brow in the extreme - which is were its charm lays. Being a fan of animated Grindhouse films like Fritz The Cat, Heavy Traffic, Shame Of The Jungle and Hey Good Looking to name a few, it feels great to have something like this in theaters in this day and age. It gives a much needed middle finger to our atmosphere of enforced ""politically correctness"". It tries very hard to offend everyone equally in a manner that allows the audience to laugh at their own short comings and beliefs. On top of the low brow humor there is some very clever plot twists and gimmicks - which I'll leave you to discover.

Too Much Message...Not Enough Comedy?,"Now it is certainly unsurprising that Sausage Party, Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg's latest film collaboration originally struggled to get financial backing as it is one hell of a weird watch.What is most interesting about it is not particularly the shock value humour that the film plentifully employs (too much one could say) but the underlying commentary on social aspects in U.S. society including themes of the political & racial persuasion & most prominently the role religion or non-religion plays in society.Now who in their right mind would of thought that I would be coming out with a comment like that in reference to this film?...not me for sure.It must be said that given that this is a film that is supposed to be a comedy I actually thought it was lacking in out & out comedic moments, in fact the commentary/message that the film seems to channel actually overpowers or even takes over what I would consider to be the films lack of humour.Like I said previously in reference to the shock value level employed by the film, too much of said humour is left to that device and given that the film is constantly employing it it only then lessens the effect of it, don't get me wrong I did laugh at quite a few of those moments but there is a point where it did start to wear thin with me.The film itself is kind of a curiosity purely from its place in the cinematic landscape, I mean how many adult animated comedy films can you think of?...You could literally count them on one hand.It's interesting me mentioning the above given that a film or even TV series that goes by the name of South Park is surely the godfather of adult shock humour and surely of great inspiration for this film yet what their cinematic exploits featured was not just a message but some ingenious musical routines and most importantly humour that never seems to let up on the viewer.However the film does have to gain credit in doing something that I never thought possible as given that I'm a South Park veteran viewer it really does take something extraordinary to shock me and the apparent mutilation of food in a variety of ways really did have me grimacing with some regularity and they certainly didn't hold back on the 'adult' nature of the animated comedy.It's certainly an interesting film project but it doesn't quite fulfill its purpose/potential given the ideas the film has to offer.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation

Twizard Rating: 63,"The animation is easy to watch with its unique look and feel, and the grocery puns are usually very clever and well thought-out, but besides that, Sausage Party is more gag-inducing than funny. And you can't help but think that it's merely for shock value.As thought-provoking as it intends to be, it's mostly in vain due to its irreverence. The items in a grocery store are all brainwashed to believe that humans are their gods, and that they must be ""chosen"" to reach the Great Beyond--which is unknown to any of them at the time.It's led by a sausage, Frank (Seth Rogen), who is slowly discovering the truth--that humans aren't gods, but monsters set out to murder all of them--but no one will listen to him. The storyline has promise, but much of the time is spent on extraneous sex jokes, for the sheer purpose of having sex jokes made by pieces of food.It has its moments, but you spend too much time cringing or laughing out of discomfort. And even within the ridiculous logic of the film, certain things still don't always make sense.Certain characters are enjoyable, like a chewed up piece of gum who cannot die because he's a piece of gum. But on the other hand, there's a villain (besides the humans) whose motives are foggy and entirely unconvincing.Honestly, the film's strongest aspect is making us truly want to know how it will end. But when it does, you're still not completely satisfied.Twizard Rating: 63",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Hilarious!!...if you're twelve.,"How could anyone over 12 possibly find any of this funny? The movie is planted with way too much sex jokes, drugs and curse words. Believe me, I'm not against these sort of things when it comes to comedy, but this movie overdoes it way too much. You know those 11 year olds on Call of Duty cursing and making adult jokes like crazy in a cringy attempt to seem older? That's this movie. Instead of actually using real humor, the writers thought that adults would crack up every time someone dropped the f-bomb (which, btw, is every sentence). Way too much effort in making this adult theme, not enough effort in producing good content. The plot had potential, but it was executed awfully. I don't normally rate things so low, but this movie is godawful.",2.0,Anonymous,Animation
What You'd Expect from a Sausage Party Movie,"Sausage Party (2016)** (out of 4)From the pothead mind of Seth Rogan comes this adults only animated feature that takes place in a grocery store. The basic plot is that the food has been led to believe that if they are chosen and taken to the outside then they have a great life ahead of them. They do realize that the Gods (humans) are actually taking them out of the store to eat them. A hot dog and a bun, madly in love with each other, must try to convince people of what's really going on.You know, I didn't hate SAUSAGE PARTY but at the same time you can tell that a bunch of stoners wrote it. I can just imagine the group sitting around a table, passing a joint around and once their minds are blown they begin talking about weird stuff and the idea of talking food comes up. I can see them grabbing the various foods in the house and acting out what would eventually come the screenplay. All of that is fine and good. Back in my younger days when I smoked I came up with some pretty funny and weird things.This movie would have worked a lot better had it been a thirty-minute short film because clocking in at 87-minutes there are just way too many jokes that don't work and on the whole the film just really seems to drag. After all, there's really not much of a plot or any sort of character development. You're basically watching talking food carry on and say a bunch of dirty words and sexual innuendo. Again, some of it is funny but for the most part I just didn't think enough of the jokes worked. The vocal performances are fine. The animation is great. It's just not funny enough to really be worth watching.",,Anonymous,Animation
"the Best, Craziest  Seth Rogen' s comedy","Before I watched the movie, I was thinking about what will happen in the movie. Weed, drunk, party, and swearing. However, this one is way higher than my expectation. It's like the movie Zootopia.(not exactly) they create the world with different types of food which represent the different types one people on earth. The animation is good, but still need to improve on some of the detail. The thing I don't like is the still dialogue. Yes, it is a rated movie, but swearing in the movie is really not that funny anymore. And it does show the strong relationships between each other. That is why I give it a 6.

"An Adequate R-rated, Vulgar, CGI Comedy","Realizing this is the first full-length, CGI animated R-rated flick, I just had to see it for myself. Since Seth Rogen and his crew admitted this movie is an intentional spoof of Pixar and DreamWorks films, it left me further curious on what was to expect. When it ended, I thought to myself, ""Past animated movies went the R-rated route before, so is this a step further?""The story revolves around Frank (Seth Rogen), a sausage along with his friends wanting to be chosen by human shoppers or as the foods call them ""gods"" to find a new life in what they call home. Though it's not all what it seems when they find out the horrific truth of their fates, so he and his fellow foods must band together to follow their own destinies.The concept of personifying inanimate objects is something that existed many times before, but by giving it the R-rated treatment, there's no holding back with sexual content and foul language. My nitpicks of it were the lack of proper depth in the human characters (save for the druggie) and the excessive cursing just to be funny wears thin easily after a while, though the food puns sure had me laughing especially its shock value in the various predicaments each of the food characters face (albeit forced and a tendency to be predictable that I sometimes turned away out of embarrassment).In the past, I've watched a handful of R-rated animated films of different genres whether of domestic or overseas origin (some of which were milestone pieces that broke ground or shaped the medium much differently compared to the ones for younger audiences), but marking the first CGI-animated in this category is something that's not often done. Story-wise, it toys with themes of existentialism, religion and even reality-bending material. Among the various Seth Rogen comedies I've seen (""Paul"" still one personal favorite), it's like ""This Is The End: Food Edition."" With the voices of Rogen, Jonah Hill, Danny McBride, Bill Hader, Kristen Wiig, and other Judd Apatow regulars, they sure sounded like they had a riot lending their voices to these characters on screen, not to mention the irony of involving Disney veteran Alan Menken composing the music and the opening number. On another note, it's like it's trying to follow in the footsteps of the last R-rated, animated box office success that was South Park back in 1999 (which coincidentally parodied Disney animated musicals of the 90s). Although it wouldn't be fair to compare Rogen's brand of humor to Trey & Matt's South Park, I'd say it's wanting to reach similar ranks in terms of violent, vulgar humor if not exactly high standard. This is a rarity in this current era of CGI animation, check it out and don't expect your kids to watch it anytime soon since it's obviously not for them.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation

Almost Great,"This film is the first movie in a very long time that has renewed my belief that you can challenge social boundaries head-on.Some of the characters are hilarious, some of the dialog, while not clever, is great because it's willing to confront social taboos.WARNING! No matter how open minded you are, this movie is not for children. This is totally an adults only movie. There is some violent and gruesome imagery, many explicit references to sex and homosexuality. If you heed that warning, you will be spending a lot of time explaining adult references.The stand-out performances were from Seth Rogen and Kristin Wiig as a hot-dog and bun. Kristin is so true to herself and her comedy helped the movie shine.The animation is mediocre. It's definitely not bad. It reminds me of Toy Story 1 in its simplicity.If the movie has faults, it has profanity for the sake of profanity and it is about 10 minutes too long. The movie became tedious toward the end and I was a little too eager to see it finished.If you're looking for a movie that challenges social norms and will certainly offend anyone Politically Correct, this is your movie. However, it's not quite the clever movie it could have been. If you had the likes of Mel Brooks on the writing credits, he would have provided the secret sauce to take the film from funny/profane to comic gold/social commentary.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Weird, obscene and just plain out offensive but quite enjoyable to watch.","Okay, to start this off: this movie is definitely NOT for kids. It definitely deserves its R-rating. Sausage Party is one of those movies that will make you say: what the hell am I watching?To be frank(see what I did there?), this movie fulfilled every bit of expectation I had, no more and no less in its ""well, I think I've seen enough"" factor. What I mean by that, is that this is the most vulgar and xenophobic animated movie I've ever seen but in a good way. As obnoxious as this movie is, I can't help but giggle half the time when I'm watching it, even though how disgusting and indecent some of the scenes are, especially at the end. And mostly because of that, I will never see food the same way ever again(the animation is pretty good though).Maybe my only true complaint about this movie was the ending, since it seems it was just tacked in there ""just because"" but to be fair, the movie was already weird as it is. So yeah, the ending for me felt kinda random and I feel that it should've ended in that particular scene before it but overall, I don't think it won't affect what most people thought about this film. Though I expect that this movie will offend a lot of people but to hell with that! let your immature side take over for a while and enjoy this film about food getting it on and on and on..... and on.If you like humor that is both weird and outrageously crass but still remotely funny, then look no further since Sausage Party is the movie for you.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation

"Five-Word Review: Dumb, Funny, Sometimes Cleverly Subversive","Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg have carved their own niche of American comedy films close to the Apatow brand but more crass. The roster that includes Superbad, Pineapple Express, and This is the End now adds Sausage Party, a decidedly adult-oriented comedy designed to offend and shock, insulting just about every race and belief imaginable. Little would you expect it could also make you think at times. A starry cast supports this animated riff on Pixar stories such as Toy Story, with the likes of Rogen, Edward Norton, Michael Cera and Kristen Wiig lending their voices to the story of sentient foodstuffs discovering that their 'gods' are actually humans who kill and eat them.Sausage Party often feels like two films in one. On the superficial level it is a dumb, crass, raunchy sex comedy with talking, orgy- loving food characters to appeal to the same stoner crowd as Pineapple Express. On another level, it is an intelligent and well- observed social commentary with witty takes on current social issues related to religion, race, sexuality, and world conflict. This is the film's strength and flaw. The worst of the film is when it is being too dumb and juvenile, with punchlines extending to nothing more than a blurted profanity, a lazy racial slur, or a sex joke that would make a 13 year old laugh. Too much of the film is like this, and a probable sequel would be much improved by focusing up and being less immature.Nevertheless, there's a lot that's funny in Sausage Party. Some of the parodies are on the nose - including excellent riffs on Saving Private Ryan, The Terminator, and, in one grotesque scene, Ratatouille. The situations the foods find themselves in are often very clever - a bagel and a lavash personify (foodify?) the Israel- Palestine conflict, and the main hot dog bun wants a bigger role in life than to just be filled by a sausage. Meanwhile, the voice cast is superb. Nick Kroll (Parks and Recreation's Douche, in a similar role) expertly plays a rapey gymbro character. Norton is unrecognisable as the Jewish 'Sammy Bagel Jr.', while Rogen, Cera, and Wiig are all stellar.Overall it's a funny film that is worth a watch, and is a nice counterpart to similarly plotted animated films aimed at kids, such as Toy Story. It just feels like it could have been better at times; hopefully the sequel can combine this film's strengths with some improvements. 67/100",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

If you're going to try to take this movie seriously in any way, you're going to hate it and feel like you wasted your time and money.So, the movie is quite clever, oddly charming at points, extremely unique and the baseline of the story, however absurd it may be, continuously flows.As far as the rating, it's a tough one because it can't really be compared head to head with any other movie. It's uniquely entertaining to the right person, its comedy is in its own realm, surely it's not worthy of a rating reserved for truly exceptional movies (7 or higher), but surely it's not worthy of a rating reserved for utter garbage (3 or less).

(Though I read somewhere it took Rogen 10 years to write?!) Also because I feel obliged to add this brief review to warn others even though it does not deserve or warrant any further attention or time spent on it. Just so you know this is supposed to be animation for 'adults', Rogen throws in religion, violence,sex, sexuality,drugs,rape, constant profanity - indeed anything where he hopes offence can be generated. If you have nothing funny to say then Rogens' philosophy ( I use the term lightly) is grab all the taboos and chuck them back in the hope the audience at least react. It is a pitiful attempt. It tries so hard it falls flat. You would think the dialogue was written by an overexcited,immature, half-witted teen who had just discovered the word 'fuck' and every character repeating it is hilarious.

Seth Rogen got talents like Edward Norton, James Franco and Jonah Hill. There's quite a few really good actors attached to this film.

I think I probably smiled 2-3 times.For me there was so much swearing it spoilt any developing 'plot' I wouldn't recommend to anyone, whether 15 years old or older",1.0,Anonymous,Animation
Highly Disappointed,"The minute I finished watching the trailer, I was eager to watch this here film. At the time, I believed as though this movie would be hilarious. I was proved wrong. Extremely wrong. I suppose the creators of this movie put all the good parts (if any) into the trailer. I have an immense sense of humor, I enjoy laughing throughout day to day activities. I found that I did not genuinely laugh once. Not once. I find humor in sexually-geared jokes, but none of the jokes in this film were funny. I am a huge fan of the actors/actresses involved in this movie. I feel bad that they were forced to succumb to being involved in such a poorly executed film. 1/10: Would not recommend to my worst enemy.",1.0,Anonymous,Animation

"Funny, and original","Sausage Party is a deceptive food cartoon by Seth Rogen and his collaborator Evan Goldberg, which initially focuses on anthropomorphized food using profanity on supermarket shelves. However, the film's world-building is surprisingly thorough, as the supermarket is a total institution with occupants from around the world who are kept compliant by an unprovable belief system. If they obey the gods, they will be chosen and taken to the ""Great Beyond"" outside the automated doors in a cart. However, the ""unfresh"" sausages and buns are tossed into a dusty bin by a sadist tormentor. This fear prevents them from getting intimate, despite their urges to conjoin. The lead sausage Frank is upbeat and cheery for his shelfmate Brenda, a bun who returns his affection. All is well at the store, with the happy food singing songs of praise to the gods who will one day scoop them up. However, when the shellshocked honey mustard returns with stories of the gods being bloodthirsty monsters, things start to change. The first of several extraordinary set-pieces occurs when the heroes are selected, but an overturned cart leads to chaos and a punctured bag of white flour provides a 9/11-esque cloud. The film has a shocking amount of proper, terrorizing fear, which is necessary for the comedy to work. Frank and Brenda are disoriented and must return to their aisle to repackage themselves without getting tossed. They are joined by a Jewish bagel and an Arabic lavash, who believe in the Great Beyond and are doused in 77 bottles of virgin olive oil. They bicker and discover they are being hunted by an angry vaginal douche, a play on steroid-jacked Italian-Americans. Racial stereotypes await on every aisle, and the movie features an adorable potato singing Danny Boy and shouting ""Jaysus Fook!"" The movie has a richer message than the goofy moments, such as a doper on bath salts seeing and hearing living food in his house and a Stephen Hawking-inspired piece of chewed-up bubblegum. It is a pro-reason, pro-knowledge story that vehemently opposes the corruption found in organized religion.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Tedious and uninspired profanity.,"When I first saw this film advertised I really looked forward to it. Within minutes of it starting I thought, ""Yeah, oh well... let's give it a chance"". Pretty much everything from that moment is lost time I will never re-coup.Maybe if the plot was good I could give it more stars, maybe if the jokes were funny I could give it more stars, maybe if the scenes were engaging, maybe, maybe maybe. But none of that was to be. The only reason I gave it 2 was that the animation was pretty good, but that's hardly a redeeming quality to overcome the the vacuous and childish premise of the whole film.I like swearing just as much as the next red blooded Australian. But only 10 year old's would find the way it was used in this film more than slightly amusing. Along with that and the infantile sex jokes, the whole thing took me right back to primary school... except we weren't subject to such crass stupidity from adults then. We were kids and made it up for ourselves. It was a very short lived phase of childhood. I find it hard to believe there's people out there that didn't mature past that point.Gladly I can say that I didn't watch the whole thing, neither will I waste my time writing much more about it. You can save yourself further disappointment now, too. It's not too late.Avoid.",2.0,Anonymous,Animation
bun bites,"Not your typical animation, Sausage Party is a look into one of the modern world's obsession-food. It delves into the grocery aisles and tells the story from their perspective. Where the love interest of a particular hot dog and bun yearning for each other so intense that they delve into tip play. Raunchy at times, this adolescent humor is funny at times and as long as you enter with that in mind, the movie is pretty good. No stereotype is left behind as you discover a talking taco and whole cast of misfits. The hot dog through his odyssey discovers foods fate and uses it as a cause to warn others. The danger of the human gods and how food nourishes their cravings. There are tender moments where the foods come together for a united front. These horny treats leave nothing behind as the audience is left with there is not better to satisfy a craving that indulge in a little food play.

Probably just offended people of which the current decade of rife with. Or maybe seeing a animation done in the game style and CGI as many innocent/family friendly one's but with such adult humour is to out of place for some to look past. It's about food items in a supermarket awaiting paradise (paradise being to be selected by a customer and leave) but they are unaware of what awaits them once they leave the supermarket.Could it have been better? Probably, with more thought or emphasis on wit for viewers to catch than the straight in the face obvious humour; something many family animations aimed at kids manage to squeeze in for the parents.

Classless bilge,"I'm not one to shy away from adult humor. This was not humorous. Not even remotely funny. I kept thinking it would lead up to some redeeming quality, but the pit in my stomach just grew deeper with each minute that laboriously ticked by as I realized this dirty diaper of a film could not be redeemed. The plot went from bad to worse, and then downhill from there. They scraped the bottom of the slime from the bottom of the barrel and decided that it wasn't filthy enough. Crass and vulgar are okay, but this was also artless. They left nothing to the imagination. There was no subtlety or room for audience interpretation of any of the dim, witless drivel they call humor. If you blew your infected-sinus nose onto the filmstrip it would be worth more. I'd pay double the ticket price to unwatch this tripe, and I'm truly thankful that it was so unmemorable. Consider yourself warned.",1.0,Anonymous,Animation

You can't use animated cows pigs and harvested fruits, grains and vegetables too many Child movies have sentient animals.To enjoy the film or the polarized debate of Hedonism vs Faith (Obviously the comics are Atheist/Agnostics based on the ending and what 'The Great Beyond' is.You have to abandon that once most of the market items happen to all be dead already. The Beef Hot Dog is part of the cows afterlife?Like is the sequel they're eaten and become sentient pieces of fecal matter? So try to just enjoy the metaphor.But the concept of animals or lower beings or inanimate Toys believing there's something more misguided or not has been done. This takes that into a grocery and adds the category of clever toilet humor.The ""Sanitary"" nemesis was unique and salvaged the entire story.I found it to basically be the same as ""The End"" at James Franco's house with more characters and some social commentary thrown in besides the Hedonist vs Faith.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
A Meaty Mess or a Sizzling Success? Eyebrows and Appetites Are Raised in Equal Measures by Sausage Parties!,"The boisterous animated comedy Sausage Party gives the usually family-friendly genre a novel and surprising spin. The film offers a wild and unusual experience for those looking for a change from the norm, pushing the bounds of animated storytelling with its daring and irreverent comedy. The voice cast, which is lead by Seth Rogen, gives animated interpretations that give the anthropomorphic food characters a quirky and sometimes thought-provoking amount of personality and wit.However, not everyone may enjoy the movie's heavy focus on crude and filthy humor. The bold approach to animated narrative may be appreciated by some viewers, but others may find the constant stream of jokes aimed at adults to be bothersome and even offensive. Although the story is creative, it periodically becomes disoriented in the middle of the mayhem, which makes some viewers wonder if a more nuanced harmony between humor and content might have improved the movie. ""Sausage Party"" is a divisive experience overall that will either make you laugh aloud or shake your head at its ridiculousness.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation

This is one movie that should be thrown out to never be seen again, such a waste for the people who took the time to voice the movie, and create 3D models and scenes.

It's A Party,Sausage Party is an actually well thought out comedy/parody cartoon movie. Seth Rogan absolutely let's out all of his crude humor in this one and it's non stop. Its such a creative and unique movie taking creative liberty with food from a grocery store as characters. The writing and ideas behind all the characters and how they interact with each other are actually very well done and thought out. I found myself laughing throughout even though sometimes the lines and humor went a little too far and was a little over done. Regardless I still found this worth the late night watch and laugh.

Horrible movie. Had to walk out,"I gave this movie 40 minutes to entertain me. That's about as long as I could tolerate before I had to walk out. It's just an abysmal pile of crap. It's the kind of thing a bunch of twelve year olds would write during recess. This is the epitome of stoner humor: Just cuss a lot and you'll get doped up morons to laugh.It's not clever. It's not funny. It's just stupid. Every line of dialogue is awful, and pretty much every attempt at humor makes me wonder if Seth Rogen should be tested for retardation.I'll give you an example. So the wiener and the bun want to get together, and they tough fingers through their wrappers. They refer to this as ""just the tip"" which makes no sense at all. That's NOT what ""just the tip"" means, and yet it's a running gag that produced NO laughs from the audience I saw (half) the movie with. In fact, I heard no audible laughs for the duration. Hell, the trailers got more laughs, and most of them looked stupid.",1.0,Anonymous,Animation

Trying too hard...,"...to be edgy or offensive, and it shows. A lot of it flowed naturally and worked fine. But closer to a quarter of the film was A Bit that was specifically sexual, or racist, or whatever, never meshed with the rest of it, interrupted the action, and usually wasn't even especially funny.Also didn't like any of the Explain What Is Happening. 4th dimension? And people high enough can see them then? No. Bad idea.Wish I could just hate it, but the core was pretty good. A sort of fully-horrifying version of Toy Story 2, with a secret life under our noses, and a terrible truth to it. Liked the premise, liked the parts that stuck to telling that story.

Crazy - in a mostly good way,"'Sausage Party' is... well, just plain nuts! Probably the best description is ""absurd"". It's certainly unique, being the first 'adult' GCI film (not just a cartoon like the 'South Park' movie) and it does all it can to push the boundaries of making sure you remember it's not a kids film (even though it starts with a song), with so many swear words, racial stereotypes, sexual innuendo and drugs in the first 30min that you can't forget it's a Seth Rogen film. Frank (the sausage, Rogen) and his girlfriend Brenda (the bun, Wiig) can't wait to get out of their packages and be united in the ""Great Beyond"" outside the supermarket.When Barry (Cera) and Carl (Hill), Frank's sausage buddies, are bought and find out the truth of what happens to food, they try to return to warn the others. The voice actors are great - Sammy (bagel, Norton), Lavash (Krumholtz), Teresa (taco, Hayek), Douche (Kroll), Firewater (Hader), Grits (Robinson), Honey mustard (McBride). It's part road trip, part action/'Die Hard' and part stoner rom-com. The ""human world"" vs ""food world"" distinction is done well, with faded colour vs vibrancy. Some of Rogen's almost-sermons on not following the religious crap you're fed without proof is good, but the anti-religion message is lost in the chaos.It's not as uproarious as I was hoping - it's certainly funny and has a lot of chuckles, but there wasn't many truly hilarious moments for me. Part of that is my expectations being too high - I've been waiting for this film for three years and it's nowhere near as good as 'Knocked Up', 'Superbad' or 'Pineapple Express'. Some of the best bits are the morbid/violent bits, not necessarily the dialogue. The last 20min or so didn't really work for me - a bit too much. There's so much going on and so many things to look at and listen to that some jokes are lost or skipped over.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
One more stoner movie by the Apatow Gang that fails miserably,"So I have nothing against Seth Rogen and I quite liked some of his other R rated movies like This is the End and Interview. This one though, gets no where near to being remotely entertaining and the lack of effort in making this movie is plainly visible. I imagine Seth got the idea for anthropomorphic grocery during one of their weed sessions and then decided to make a film about it. The producers at Sony probably hurried them into making this so they could follow in the footsteps of Deadpool and profit. You can't just throw crass humour and expect it to come good always. You need to write a ton of jokes, pick the better ones and then improve on them. The only way you can entertain people with the first thing that comes into your mind is if you are a comedic genius; unfortunately there aren't any in the Jew gang.",1.0,Anonymous,Animation
Wonderful comedy that summarizes the nature of the human life,"*Possible Spoilers!*This movie will be emotionally rejected by highly religious people without a thought. Although the language can be quite shocking, the movie reveals the real nature of humanity and survival instincts. I like this movie because it was a different and brave show of cultural references like Freudian psychology, racism, antisemitism, the new look at modern science, and has connections to Stephen Hawking, and even critiques the distant spirituality in our consumerist society. The movie gives us a twisted view of the question ""What if you can be consumed"". With small pop culture influences and a great finale in reference to the world-recognized book by German author Patrick Süskind, Perfume: The Story of a Murderer, this movie turns out to be a great message to people who are real literates.

a full course meal of a very dangerous comedy!,"Some of you may be too young to remember (or maybe too old, who knows), but once upon a time a man named Ralph Bakshi made hard-R rated animation that was decidedly not meant for simply for families to gobble up, so at the same time Disney put out something like Robin Hood, he had Heavy Traffic, which was an semi-autobiographical, ""X-rated"" look at life in Brooklyn with all the rough edges showing, or in 1975 (his masterpiece to me) Coonskin, which took off from Song of the South to make a scathing satire on race using black caricatures, blaxploitation and other characters like a naked woman with red-white-and-blue body paint. But of course times have changed and now animation is practically never even made much less released at a wide scale (when was the last time, South Park, maybe, or by extension Team America). So, with this in mind, and ironic to say given the subject matter, but thank God for Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg for Sausage Party.Is it a perfect movie? No, but who the f*** cares? This is one of the smarter films of the summer, if not the year, and surprising in that it delivers one thing in its marketing - a parody of all of these talking-whatever movies (you know from Pixar, ""when the lights go out X is actually alive and talking, and there's an adventure story where one or two characters get separated and have to find their way back etc etc"") and with the kind of ""explicit"" language that Rogen-Goldeberg and company have put out there since Superbad nine years ago. However if you see the movie it delivers something deeper, subverting expectations that come with something that looks so goofy (the film's directors have credits ranging from Monsters vs Aliens, with Rogen did a voice for by the way, and Thomas the Tank Engine videos!) but is about... religion and the power and susceptibility of beings towards faith.That may sound like blowing hot air like, how can this be anything more than its surface-level crude comedy and stereotypes? But right from the on-set, where the characters refer to the ""Gods"" and the opening song (the only main one so it's not a musical) where it's all about praising the Gods and the ""Great Beyond"" which is, of course, the Great Lie of being chosen by humans to be taken away as what they're meant for, the writers of the film take an opportunity and don't settle only for the gross-out... this is not to say this is not a filthy, raucous, ludicrous film that includes such things as, well, bath salts that make people hallucinate to the point where they can SEE THE FOOD TALKING (is that what they do, I wouldn't know, haven't tried it, sorry), and stereotypes of every thing you can think of from Irish potatoes to a Jewish bagel and a Muslim falafel and a Mexican (Lesbian!) taco to a Firewater Native American alcohol can (and Craig Robinson... well, see the movie to know about that).Because, yes, they're here in spades! What makes Sausage Party impactful is that it takes a leap to be *about* something, even if it ends up being rather gruesome and very, horrifically, violent (yes, for an R-rated movie this is one of the more violent pieces of escapism - perhaps in its way more honest than something like a PG-13 Suicide Squad despite/because of things like decapitated heads or exploding organs and so on). It even has a point about what it means to be an inspiration to people, that to change minds you can't simply show the ""truth"" right away and that different factions can't process that information. If that sounds odd, well, this climax is especially odd and totally insane. But it's also a brilliant conclusion to a very good movie, full of balls-to-the-wall action and a don't-take-no-prisoners attitude towards the food vs the humans. It reaches Inglourious Basterds level catharsis.Again, it's not totally up there with This is the End or Pineapple Express, the landmarks for this duo and their collaborators. On a first watch the Jew/Arab duo were a little one-note as a joke (so are a lot of the characters, which are fine, but these are here for longer period), and it also didn't make sense completely what could or couldn't talk (i.e. why the food AND things like a d**che or toilet paper or so on, what about the shopping cart or a television, where's the line drawn?) But these are relatively minor complaints in a movie that gets by by being so harrowingly hysterical in how it delivers its comedy - these guys have the opposite of fear, which is what you need for comedy. They have confidence in their vulgarity, so who cares if it has like 400 f***s? It has zero of them to give! Add on impressive voice-work (Edward Norton as the bagel! And James Franco gives one of his best performances in a while as ""Druggie"") and you got yourself a winner, and a fine successor to people who used animation as a mechanism for delivering hardcore, drag-through-the-mud satire like Bakshi or Mike Judge.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

Raw and gross,"Boiled down to the basics, it is set in a supermarket, where all the products take on characters, most are potty mouths, with a lot of F words and plenty of sexual overtones, most quite blatant. Instead of innuendo, it is right out in the open. Clearly for adults, and sometimes I feel it goes overboard into juvenile humor, but certainly not for those under age. There has been a myth spread that when they are bought, they are taken to the great beyond, which is to be the goal of all of them. Being selected is their idea of heaven. There is a lot of cleverness in providing human attributes to the different items. And even ethnic characters for cultural products. There probably is little middle ground to this movie. One will either love the grossness or be offended. If offended, why didn't the person read any reviews as to what the movie is about? This is the type of movie one would have roared about laughing if one was 14, but certainly would never have been allowed to watch. And they probably wouldn't have understood some of the sexual humor.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
It was okay,"Unique and irreverent approach to the concept of grocery store products coming to life.Sausage Party certainly stands out for its bold and adult-oriented humor, offering a satirical take on the supermarket and the beliefs of the food items within. The film's premise is inventive and original, bringing a fresh perspective to the animated genre.The voice cast, featuring Seth Rogen, Kristen Wiig, Jonah Hill, and others, brings energy and enthusiasm to their food character roles. Their comedic performances add to the film's humorous moments and make the food characters surprisingly relatable.Visually, Sausage Party is colorful and engaging, with the animation capturing the essence of a bustling grocery store. The attention to detail in bringing the food products to life is commendable, creating an immersive world filled with talking groceries.However, while Sausage Party has its moments of hilarity and clever satire, the film's humor may not be to everyone's taste. Its adult themes and raunchy jokes might alienate more conservative viewers or those expecting a typical family-friendly animated film.Furthermore, the film's satirical elements, while thought-provoking at times, can feel heavy-handed and overdone, taking away from the enjoyment for some audiences.In conclusion, Sausage Party offers a unique and audacious take on the animated genre, bringing a bold sense of humor and satire to the world of talking groceries. While it delivers on some laughs and creative visuals, its adult-oriented content and heavy-handed approach may not resonate with all viewers.If you're open to trying something different and appreciate irreverent humor, Sausage Party might provide an amusing and unconventional cinematic experience. However, if you prefer more traditional animated comedies, this one might not be your first choice.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation

"Hysterically Crude, Clever, and Heartfelt","Comedy films are a special breed. While the main criteria for them is to be funny, I believe they should also strive to be actually good narratives. Comedies are still films and deserve to be taken just as seriously as any drama, thriller, or what have you. They are films all the same, all just with a different agenda of what emotion they want to elicit from the audience. Comedies may arguably be the most challenging type of film to make, as not only do you need a good script to keep the audience interested, but you also have to make them laugh. When that comedy film is also animated and totally R-rated, it becomes an ambitious and interesting project all its own. Sausage Party, the new, crude animated film from the deranged minds of Seth Rogen and his entourage, absolutely succeeds in every respect.In the drab and depressing real world, food takes on a life of its own in the ever so vibrant and colorful Shopwell's. Every morning, the entire inventory of food and various other supermarket products break out into a song, claiming that one day the Gods (humans) will come and take them to Paradise. Our hero is a hot dog named Frank (Seth Rogen), whose main goal is to get all up inside his future soulmate, the hot dog bun Brenda (Kristen Wiig). Luckily, they are both chosen by the Gods, but unfortunately for them, a shell-shocked jar of honey mustard that has returned from the great beyond and reveals the horrifying truth: the Gods love torturing them and devouring them. After a catastrophic grocery cart spill where Frank, Brenda, and other foodstuff characters are stranded in the closed grocery store, they all embark on an epic journey throughout the vast supermarket in order to find out the truth and hopefully save their brethren from certain doom.There's something to be said about films that completely shatter your expectations, but this one doesn't just shatter them. It keeps rebuilding them and shattering them over and over until you're absolutely numb; numb from laughing so hard. I honestly can't remember that last time a theatrically released comedy film has put me into tearful hysterics. While the premise initially seems it will wear itself thin, as they really open the flood gates of vulgar and raunchy humor from the beginning, the film keeps sucker punching you with hilariously clever visual gags coming from all angles. It does absolutely everything it can with the unique premise and puts it into overdrive until the end credits finally role. A lot of great comedies over the past few years have had some great laughs throughout, but they were usually somewhat spaced out. With this, I felt like I was laughing throughout every frame.Not only is the film hilarious, but the script is actually very tight and well written. However, this doesn't come as a huge surprise to me, as I think Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg are the best working comedy screenwriters in film today. With the help of Kyle Hunter and Ariel Shaffir, who both had a hand in writing last year's fantastic Seth Rogen vehicle The Night Before, they are all smart enough to know that outrageously raunchy humor isn't enough to keep audiences completely invested. The characters actually have their own distinct motivations and arcs, the plot keeps going in crazy, yet logical directions, and every single joke and aspect to the movie has a great set-up with an even better payoff. There's even some commentary on religious and personal beliefs thrown in there, that really make the novel concept feel even more unique and rich. Everything about how this film was written and executed was pretty much flawless. I feel like Rogen and his entourage don't get enough credit, as people usually say their films are nothing but ""pot humor"". While their films always have that content, there's still always that humanity and sincerity to it, and the characters always feel somewhat relatable and real. Who knew I would ever actually be invested in the plight of a cartoon hot dog? Credit must also be given to the fantastic directors and animators who brought this film to life. Everything is just so beautifully detailed. Cereal boxes with concerned eyes line the shelves and observe characters arguing, bottles of alcohol are all throwing a crazy party in the middle of the night, and many other clever visual gags throughout that I don't want to spoil. The world felt so alive. I can't wait to watch it again to see all that I missed. There's a visual dichotomy between the grungy, almost black and white real world, compared to the bright and colorful world that food experience, which was a great touch in order to differentiate the two worlds. Everything is supremely detailed, especially during the amazingly visceral sequences of violence. I think personified food getting gruesomely murdered is quite possibly the funniest thing I've ever seen in my life.Humor is completely subjective and this film is certainly not for everybody. There is a lot of humor that many would consider offensive, but for my sick sense of humor and the way the film handled it all, I couldn't get enough. Personally, not only is Sausage Party the most clever, unique, inventive, and hysterical animated film I've seen all year, it's the best film I've seen so far this year, in general. Nothing but laughs, beautiful animation, fantastic voice acting from the entire cast, and a carefully well written script to hold it all together. Congratulations, Seth Rogen and company, you made a film about a hot dog and a bun getting horny for each other my favorite film of 2016. Hats off to you.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Not a good movie for any audience,"not made for kids, old people or those with taste. I don't mind the anti god, or crude language, just hate poor jokes not matter how far they go.I guess if you are an adult with a low IQ you might like this type of thing, but I can't understand how. I think this movie was put together without much thought or imagination. I don't write books or movies, but this motivates me to do something, can't believe someone was on so many drugs that they thought funding this project was a good idea. If you do have a movie, send it to these producers, obviously these guys need some good scripts.

"Plenty on the Plate, Lacking in Flavour","Arguably flattering its 18 rating, Sausage Party is very much a party - with an abundance of food, drink and some unwelcome surprises.Anthropomorphic food items in a grocery store believe that humans are divine beings who take them to a better place. However, they are devastated to find the true reason for their existence.The film oozes fun, it is one naturally to make you laugh in its quirky and animated fashion. Seth Rogan, Jonah Hill and Evan Goldberg take credit for the vision of the project, one which erupted in the cinematic universe of animation. An 18 for animation was very rare, particularly including sexual references and coarse language, though, its warning is present and perhaps unwarranted. The movie could've gotten away with a 15 though some jokes hidden between the lines takes only the mature to understand its immaturity.There is little to talk about in terms of the quality or disappointments with the film, so argue you don't get what you set out to expect, and what to see a more graphic, inappropriate approach. Others believe it is a welcome alternative to animation and comedy in that a perhaps missing-substance plot is of just right measure to entertain its target audience.For me, Sausage Party ticks only a few boxes, however its climatic release and high anticipation may leave you despondent after viewing.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation

Zootopia...with Sex Jokes,"The element of surprise is the cornerstone of comedy, and Rogen's crew has proved more than capable of catching us off guard with their brand of childish-adult humor (ie Knocked Up, This Is The End). Their latest venture, a bawdy animated-food comedy, finds them in an undeniably original medium. While much of the surprise in the individual jokes is gone in favor of broader concepts, Sausage Party still works, thanks to its comedic thoughts on faith and prejudice. It's a mixture of foody and racist puns that, while far from consistent, provide plenty of easy laughs. Sausage Party is the story of a gang of grocery items who go on an adventure of self-discovery and terrifying revelations. Its surprising main ingredient is its interest in social pigeonholing; think Zootopia without the cute animals and family-friendliness. Thoughtless religion and selfish bigotry are on abundant display, including a hilarious opening song (akin to the worst of modern evangelical music) and a straight-up explanation of our tendency to compartmentalize people with religion and race. Even with that self-awareness, its stereotypes are pretty tired (the bagel is a scared Jew, the taco is a sex-crazed Latino). Its racial typecasting isn't the only thing that pushes the envelope in this hard R. Cartoon parodies of violent horror and war films, drug-trip scenes, and a finale so hilariously / offensively vulgar I'm not sure I can even mention it; it's like these guys knew they could get away with more in an animated world. So while Sausage Party's inventive ideas never quite cook the jokes to their full transcendence, it's still pretty dang funny.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Why is this thing getting favorable reviews?,"I guess that if you're happy hearing the word 'fuck' being repeated ad nauseum, have no idea what subtlety is or care for it when in the service of making an allegory or can watch and actually laugh at a ninety minute single note joke that would be a ten second, throwaway, Airplane (Flying High) or Naked Gun gag then Sausage Party is for you!My girlfriend and I were anticipating a great night out at the movies with what was purported to be one of the funniest movies of the year and a landmark in animated films, period. What we got was bored. There were no jokes that you didn't have to have a wasted mental capacity to enjoy.Then there was a heavy handed subtext about religious freedoms that even the movie itself ignored.Don't get me started on the dick jokes. Christ, it was painful. The constant crass humor had no nuance or measure to it, it just kept coming and none of it was funny. It came to a horrific climax towards the end which just left me wondering if it was part of a joke I just wasn't in on. Then again, apart from our nearest neighbour to the north, no one else got it either. The audience started off excited and was led in nervously laughing at the abominable, grotesquery the heaved and lurched and vomited vile streams from it's noise hole but after a short while they fell silent and just stared as I did.If you must see this film, make sure to get yourself a lobotomy or at least take an interpreter, say the fat idiot who sat behind us and literally NARRATED the whole movie to his moron friends. He told us, by proxy, that his favorite parts were the fact that Tequila featured in the movie and so did the liquor aisle. Riveting and very telling, thanks half-wit.",1.0,Anonymous,Animation
Sausage Party is a R-rated animated comedy,"Sausage Party is a R-rated animated comedy written by and starring Seth Rogan as Frank, a hot dog who learns the truth about what really happens to food when it's purchased by ""the gods"" (humans). Frank has to tell everybody else in the food market before it's too late. Other featured voice talent includes Kristin Wiig, Michael Cera, Jonah Hill, and Edward Norton.This movie is HILARIOUS! I haven't laughed so hard at a movie this year ad much as I did during the opening scene of this movie. The jokes range from over-the-top (how do you like them apples, etc.), and the message might speak to some. I also really liked the animation style, especially in the food characters.My only complaint with this movie is how raunchy it was. I'm not against foul language or crude humor, but there still needs to be some context with it. When a f-bomb is used every other sentence, it really waters down the effect when language like that could, as Spongebob would say, act as a ""sentence enhancer."" I was desensitized to the language after 10 minutes of film, so it never effected me when it should have.Overall, if you can handle some really heavy profanity and humor more offensive than Deadpool, you'll love this movie. If you've ever been offended by language, sexual humor, or racial stereotypes, this movie is not for you.Source: http://www.huludb.com/movies/222408-sausage-party",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

A reminder that the entertainment industry is a crumbling mess,"I myself tend to try and find the good in every film, even films that completely tank in the box office, but 'Sausage Party' was such an awful, terrible, boring, and vile film that even I cannot find a single positive characteristic in this mess of a production. The plot was boring and unoriginal, the anti-religious theme was so blatant and repetitive that I honestly have a genuine dislike for almost every actor now, and the content was so crude and void of humor that I can actually count the number of times I laughed at this film on one hand. Though I tend to think of myself having a dark/edgy sense of humor, this waste of 89 minutes showed me that some peoples' sense of humor isn't actually humorous, it's just a culmination of random and sick narcotic-fueled ideas.Coming from someone that actually enjoys watching South Park, Family Guy, and listening to Daniel Tosh's stand-up comedy, as well as not even being phased by the elephant scene in the 'Brothers Grimsby', DO NOT SEE THIS FILM.

Far Better Than It Should Be,"Frank is a sausage who has always wanted to be purchased and ""go home,"" but he does not yet know the truth. What he does not know is that his kind is used as a snack and he strives to find the truth of his existence in this cruel food-eating world.From the trailer, I figured this was going to be 90 minutes of profanity. And for the most part, that is accurate. The cursing is excessive, far beyond what should ever be in a movie. (I'm not opposed to profanity, but at a certain point it goes beyond the way any real person would talk.) What saves this film from just being curse words and mediocre animation is its social commentary. Maybe it does not say anything original, but it says the unoriginal in an original way. And, more importantly, it explains that beating your point of view over someone's head -- even if you're right -- is never the wise move.Great movie? Hardly.

"I Have An Open Mind - But This Takes The Cake, Even For An Adult Animated Film.","Nonetheless it is a fascinating watch because it brings common food items potatoes, sausages, buns, juice cartons, bagels etc., etc., to life with a voice and mind of their own.These days people are sexually open so we see references to homosexuality and lesbianism in the film. There are also graphic sex scenes played out at various points in the film. The use of the ""F"" word is predominant throughout the film alongside other use of slang. There are also few scenes of gore.Plot in brief: In a supermarket called Shopwell's, the foods and other grocery items who live there worship the human shoppers as gods who take them to the ""Great Beyond"" when they are purchased. Among the groceries in the store is a sausage named Frank (Seth Rogen), who has dreams of living with his hot dog bun girlfriend, Brenda (Kristen Wiig), in the Great Beyond, where they can finally consummate their relationship. Frank lives in a package with his best friends Barry (Michael Cera), Carl (Jonah Hill) and Troy (Anders Holm), who also look forward to life in the Great Beyond.Frank and Brenda's packages are chosen to leave Shopwell's, but their celebrations are cut short when a returned jar of Honey Mustard (Danny McBride), who has also been chosen, claims to other groceries in the shopping cart that the Great Beyond is not what they were led to believe. Before committing suicide, Honey Mustard tells Frank to visit a bottle of liquor named Firewater (Bill Hader), who is purportedly knowledgeable about the Great Beyond, so he can learn the truth.Watch the film to find out what happens next...Don't get me wrong, the animation is brilliant and there are many hilarious scenes in the film. But all this is overshadowed by the vulgarity which could have been watered down.Better animated films to watch(non CGI): Watership Down(1978), The Secret of NIMH(1982), The Plague Dogs(1982), The Great Mouse Detective(1986), Grave of the Fireflies(1988), The Secret World Of Arrietty(2010 based The Borrowers written by Mary Norton).I also recommend Mary And Max(2009) which is a stop-motion animated movie and a short animated film The Snowman(1982).",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Enough, Seth Rogen","I came into this movie hoping that it would make me laugh at least once. I mean, it's Seth Rogen, co-writer of This is The End and Superbad. I regret to inform you that I didn't laugh once during the 89 minute run time. What started out as an odd but interesting premise turned into an honest bore of a film. Each joke was more predictable than the last. The characters lacked personality and wit. I couldn't for the life of me describe Kristen Wiig's character Brenda. She was only there to be the love interest in a forced romantic subplot. And all the cultural/racial stereotypes were just weak. A Native American bottle of booze named Firewater smokes weed and sounds like he came from the 1950's Peter Pan film. The Black box of grits played by Craig Robinson sounds more like a group of white people trying to write a black person. The whole ordeal was just embarrassing.

If Pixar Had a Problem Child.,"Sausage Party, Seth Rogen's appropriately named Pixar-spoof/raunch fest, is here and it is actually pretty entertaining, if you're a sarcastic adult who enjoys shitting on everybody. Much like Deadpool did to the comic book genre earlier this year, Sausage Party takes aim at the animation genre, finally making an animation for adults. Sausage Party is as funny as it is clever, gleefully filled with profanity, but is also surprisingly thought provoking. Sausage Party never quite reaches the level of quality, of that which it pokes fun at, but does manage to do everything it set out to do.Watching this film it's incredible the ensemble cast that Seth Rogen was able to gather for this film, featuring James Franco, Jonah Hill, Paul Rudd, Edward Norton, Salma Hayek, and so many more. The plot of this film is actually a fairly entertaining one, but the real strength of the film is it's humor. That isn't surprising, considering the group behind it, but the film in essence jumps from one joke to another never leaving a dull moment. The main reason that the film is so funny is that the film is clever in how it pokes fun at the world of food.Another reason that the film is so funny is that instead of trying to be politically correct, the film almost revels in it's ability to insult whoever it can. Animation has, over the years, proved to be a genre mostly directed at kids, besides a few exceptions (South Park, Family Guy, the Simpsons.) That being said the use of excessive profanity within that genre is so rare that it often elevates a raunchy animated comedy. Seeing a bunch of talking hot dogs, and buns that are animated to look like sexual images, and then swear non-stop ends up being one of the funnier elements of the film.It seems surprising that Pixar didn't beat Sausage Party to this story though, because it could've been an even better Pixar film. By that I mean that the story of this film is actually quite clever and thought provoking, when you say to yourself, what food think if it could talk. The plot is not as focused as a Pixar film and the characters are not as emotionally involving, so Sausage Party feels more like a cheaper, raunchy Pixar film. However, this film does manage to attack a fairly thought provoking and deep storyline.In the end, Sausage Party is a really good and often entertaining spoof of the animation genre for adults above a certain age, and of a certain mindset. The film tries to remain clear of racism, simply by insulting every group of people, without prejudice, we'll see if that method works. The film is clever, funny, thought provoking, and gleefully profane. It should be stated that not everybody will enjoy this movie, but that's partially the point.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Seth Rogan was high.,"In my opinion, this movie was simply born because Seth was way too high and thought of a plot. He was like: ""hey, I got money- why not?"".I love darker, dirty humor, but this movie was kind of underwhelming. The rated-R part was is simply that they use at least 3 swears in every sentence.I think it has the same effect as ""Mack & Devin Go To High School"" where it is pointless to watch sober.

A guilty pleasure,"In a world in which food had mouths, eyes, ears, hands and legs, and is desperate to be chosen by a ""god"", thus being taken to ""The Great Beyond"", a sausage and a bun find themselves out of their package, running away from an evil douche, searching for answers regarding their existence and purpose.Sounds stupid? Well it is, but this makes this animation, which is nothing else than a filthy mouthed and erotic parody, an enjoyable watch for almost any adult. Be aware though, this movie should never be seen by any child as is content is way beyond what he or she would be allowed to see until they're 18+. Although it uses the F word as it was trying to break a record, it has a stupid plot and some idiotic characters and almost every scene features something erotic, it manages to be enjoyable until the end. It is also very funny due to its stupidity, grabbing very often a laugh from your amazed figure.You have two options when it comes to this movie. Either you have some expectations from it, case in which you'll be very disappointed and you will hate it no matter what, either you'll treat it as a laugh like I did, and enjoy it overall. I cannot recommend it to anyone unless we're talking about an adult who doesn't get easily offended by swears, who is able to take a dirty joke and find something funny about it.

"Sausage Party, nothing great from Seth Rogen but is just good","I wasn't excited for this movie because i'm not for see a lot of R animated movies. But even i saw it, i liked it. There's a really fight between this movie if is good or terrible. The first thing of Sausage Party that the best of this movie is the voice cast of the movie who makes a great job in the voices of the characters like Seth Rogen, Kristen Wiig, Nick Kroll, Micheal Cera, Jonan Hill, Edward Norton and others. The movie has some likable characters like Frank, Brenda, Barry and the villain Douche who has some of the most funniest moments of the film. The humor is a miss or hit. Sometime it can get hilarious moments, some others a funny moments and sometime really bad bad jokes like Kristin Wiig improvisation or so many insults. The score and the song ""The Great Beyond"" is great and they do have some of the best themes that i ever heard. And the last good thing of this movies are some thing of the animation like some of the takes are really good, some of the designs are decent and the backgrounds are great. But, it doesn't mean that everything of this movie is great, it has some problems. The animation is one of those. Even that is not the worst animation of all, the designs of the humans and the rest of the products are terrible. The jokes like i say, sometimes fail and when they are not funny, they suck. And all the orgy scene was the most boring scene of the movie. Is not funny or interesting so it doesn't have a purpose to be in the movie. So yeah, Sausage Party is not the best animated film of all, but is just good. I hope the animators get some justice for the idiot director Greg Tiernan who his role as a director of this one is terrible. Conrad Vernon makes a better job that him. For those who are interesting in this, i tell you that this is good for you if you are more that 16 years old to see this. For those who think is a kids film, don't be so idiots. This is a RATED R Movie. So don't show this for your kids until they have 16 years.7.3/10",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

At all. I actually did not laugh once the entire time. And that's something considering that I laugh at Drawn Together. Not a single joke hit home. That is by far the biggest sin a comedy can make. Not being funny. It doesn't matter what your theme is, or even what terrible message you're trying to get across. If you are a comedy and you are not funny, you have completely failed. And this movie completely failed.Something that I shouldn't even have to say, but unfortunately apparently I do, is that it helps if some of your characters are likable. None of them are. They are all idiots. I was not rooting for a single one of them. That's another problem you can have with your movie. Complete audience disconnect. If you don't care about the characters you don't care about their plight.It's at this point I feel I should talk about the elephant in the room. The moral\theme of the movie. Look. I am not the most religious guy in the world, but even I felt incredibly disgusted by this film. It was like they were channeling Seth McFarlane at his worst and using it to give the middle finger to the majority of America. The atheistic message was so blatantly in your face that it really felt like they were insulting people for being religious and honestly, even 'I' was offended. And when it comes to religion, that's hard to do.They were obviously trying to push some boundaries and limits they were allowed, especially with that....last scene (anyone who has seen it knows what I'm talking about) and it just caused me to facepalm and feel uncomfortable throughout the entire scene. I could forgive this movie a little if it was even the slightest bit funny. But it wasn't. There was no charm, no wit. No chemistry. No nothing. So why does this movie get a 2 instead of a 1? Because, while it was stupid and terrible, at least i can look back on it and not be angry. I just feel sad that so much talent, time, and money was wasted on a useless piece of garbage.From what I heard, this film was made in an attempt to make adult movies that rival Pixar or Disney. And honestly, if THIS is what you come out with, please leave the adult animation to the adults. Not the large children that think they're being funny by throwing in sex, atheism, and bathroom humor.Hopefully this will be this company's last film. Normally I am all for companies having not so good first movies and getting better, but I have never seen a first movie that was THIS terrible and then them going on to make decent level quality. I think it's time to close up shop. I would say you had a good run, but I would be lying.2 out of 10.",2.0,Anonymous,Animation
One Long Joke That Fails,"I'll start by saying the story and plot of the movie was good. Or gave it the purpose to make an actually movie about talking food. Otherwise the movie itself, and I like to put it this way, is one long sex joke! Seriously. Besides a couple of morbid deaths of the food and other things that I was expecting more of, you get a lot of sex jokes. And most of the jokes bored me. It gave me a few chuckles but otherwise I was just not finding it funny. Believe they could have done better but I suppose with it starring Seth Rogen, I should have expected it to be a hit or miss and it was a miss.Close to the end of the movie, not the actually ending, but close enough a scene comes on in which I basically knew was coming. And when it happened, it was the most annoying and least bit of funny to watch. Won't go into detail but its a build up and you will either laugh or just wonder when it'll be over. I can't really find much good on the film.Animation was decent. If I had laughed more or didn't see that one coming moments I believe I would have rated the movie higher. But because I can't really think of much good from the film and how bored I was throughout it I truly believe the movie deserves a 4/10.Think this movie falls into the stoner movies and that could also explain why I didn't find it as funny either. It did however make me hungry thinking of food but the movie itself didn't make me feel guilty about going into the grocery store and ""killing"" the food by eating it.All in all I recommend finding another movie, I prefer This Is The End also starring Seth Rogen and a few others. That movie was way better than this.",2.0,Anonymous,Animation
'Sausage Party' Brings Raunchy Laughs and an Oscar Worthy Song,"Animation has never been such a fantastic blend of fun and dirty as seen in ""Sausage Party"" from Sony Pictures. Created as the movie your perverted older brother made in high school but you can't help but love him for it, the definitely offensive but enthusiastically rapturous romp is the surprise hit of the summer.Directors Conrad Vernon and Greg Tiernan helm the ship that was written by Evan Goldberg, Seth Rogen, Kyle Hunter, and Ariel Shaffir with a steady hand as they play off social and racial stereotypes in the vein of something we would have seen on ""South Park."" Trickle in a talented voice cast that includes Rogen, Oscar nominees Kristen Wiig, Jonah Hill, James Franco, Edward Norton, and Salma Hayek, and you got a formula for something downright hilarious.""Sausage Party"" takes no prisoners as the profanity and graphic nature makes an educated film-goer wonder ""how the hell did this just get an 'R' rating from the MPAA?"" Shock value will bubble to the brim and likely spill over as we see food make sexual advances, dirty and used condoms interact with a smaller hotdog, and an orgy that might manage to trump any movie in the last 15 years.Taking the ""Toy Story"" premise and asking the question, what if food could talk? ""Sausage"" gives its characters a dynamic range of emotions as they mix in the very questions of today that marry the ideas of religion, purpose, and tolerance. I'm sure somewhere deep in the bones of every Pixar writer in the world, they've wanted to make THIS kind of movie. Why wouldn't they? The animation is tenderly bright and vibrant, creating a world of chaos but clarity. They work through the material with a bold and fearless nature that the Academy Awards would feel so lucky to be included among their Animated Feature nominees in 2017.Stepping outside the box with a raunchy song, Alan Menken's compositions and work stand just as high as anything delivered this year so far. Vivaciously alive in every beat, you can't help but smile ear to ear as the party rolls on. I'd surely say Menken is the hunt for an Oscar nomination in Original Song.The rest of the voice works of Bill Hader, Michael Cera, Danny McBride, Craig Robinson, Paul Rudd, and ESPECIALLY Nick Kroll are purely delightful.This is not the movie for Mom, unless your mother is awesome in every way. This is not the movie for your kids, because I can't wait to hear the headlines of the general audience goers that brought their kids to see thinking it was just a ""cute cartoon."" This is not the movie for your sophisticated movie friend because he or she is probably going to call you dumb for laughing at the jokes. This IS the movie for the Friday night, bring your girlfriend or boyfriend, watch their jaws drop, and enjoy the company of just plain old fun at the movies.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

A very smart film that sadly misses some laughs,"When the first trailer for Sausage Party came out I was shocked by both the name and the trailer. The concept sounded so amazing that I knew I had to check it out and so I did and while I enjoyed it a lot I also found myself not laughing a whole lot. Which was strange to me. The cursing and the violence started to blend into the rest of the film and in the end just left me more intrigued by what the movie was trying to say than what the jokes were.Sausage Party is a idea that was came up by Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg. This idea however came along while they were doing a little AMC show called ""Preacher."" Coincidence? I think not. Preacher is a TV show based on a comic about a man named Jesse Custer who gains the power to basically make anyone do what he wants them to do. This comic book is highly renowned for its commentary on the state of Religion at that time. It talks a lot on the idea of God and him being more of a dictator than anything else.Sausage Party does the same thing in this film. It makes a religious allusion that ""God"" is the humans and the food is us in our world today. We see God as the amazing figure and don't ever question why he was put there in the first place, and I love that about the film.Its social commentary was so good and fun that I had to give this movie a 6/10.Now if only we could get more jokes that hit",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
No one should enjoy this film (and yet I did),"There are some films which should probably come in blank DVD boxes. That way, when they're mixed in with your collection and you have friends or family round, they will never know that you really enjoyed watching an animated sausage discover the meaning of life in a supermarket by indulging in everything from murder to... I'll stop there when it comes to details (that's for the film's final act only).Yes, seriously, 'Sausage Party' is basically the polar opposite to all those delightful Disney/Pixar movies we've been taking our kids to over the years. Pixar films are delightful fun for all the family. Sausage Party is something you want to keep your kids away from for as long as possible. As I mentioned in the opening, a hotdog learns the (awful) truth about his existence. This particular hotdog is one of many different food types, all living in a supermarket (where else?!). Every morning all the foods for sale cross their fingers (yes, most at least have arms and hands, if not legs, too) and hope upon hope that a friendly human will 'choose' them for a better life in the great beyond (basically through the supermarket's sliding entrance/exit doors). Naturally, our hotdog (voiced perfectly by Seth Rogan) soon realises that his 'perfect life' will ultimately involve being roasted alive before being ground up in a human's mouth and then pushed out through the afore-mentioned human's rear. Hardly an attractive ambition for a sausage in love.Therefore, he – and his various buddies – set on a plan to escape this. At first it's a little hard to work out where this film will go. It's almost entirely set inside the supermarket and you may well wonder if this setting gives the film enough scope to really go anywhere. I'm pleased to say that that's an incorrect assumption. It never really lets up for a moment. The (very adult) humour comes thick and fast and, if you've seen any other recent Seth Rogan movie, you'll know to expect much profanity, sexual references and the – seemingly obligatory – getting high scene.You may not be able to tell some of the actors who have leant their vocal talents to this film by their performances, but Edward Norton and Salma Hayek are both newcomers, along with Seth Rogan's usual bunch of suspects such as James Franco and Jonah Hill. If you're into their collaborations then you should enjoy this. It's hard to imagine it will ever be that successful as the concept is just too 'niche' to ever get a mainstream following. It's definitely not one to watch with your grandmother, but it is extremely gross and adult fun if you're in the mood for that sort of entertainment.Oh, and as a Meat Loaf fan, I loved the 'Bat out of Hell' sequences, but that's probably just me.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
walked out,"This is the first movie I have walked out on in 12 years. The film would likely be somewhat enjoyable if you were stoned, tripping or just plain drunk. But the absolute putrid attempt at humour is so insultingly pathetic that I only wasted 45 minutes of my life on it before I left . Perhaps this film is popular with the high school and college age party folk? let me summarize : STINK STANK STUNK CRAP EXCREMENT POOH CACA SHITE PUSS FILLED SCAB, REGURGITATED CAT VOMIT, The fact that the Hollywood thought police are promoting this turd to get an Oscar??

"Raunchy and dumb comedy - some will love, some will hate","Saw the preview for this movie and had to see it. Saw it on opening weekend and the movie was more over the top than what I was expecting. The humor was dumbed down, from sex jokes to religion/race jokes, and finally about drugs. The end result was the most that I've laughed in a movie theatre in well over a decade, and the majority of the full theatre was also laughing hysterically. This movie will get a lot of complaints from prior who will want something deeper and meaningful, out the whole animation fiasco that's going on. At the end of it all this movie gets a 9 from myself as it is a solid and entertaining movie in my book.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Completely out there comedy,"Good:Sausage party is a completely out there, extremely offensive and hilarious comedy. It takes the innocent feel of a toy story like animation in which food is brought to life. Yet is twisted with adult jokes and some forms of deep relations to real life, especially involving the stereotypical theme of continents each food originates from. The idea itself is genius and brings a new, exciting and different type of comedy we haven't seen. The type of comedy in this film is extremely offensive and doesn't hold back on bad language, sex references, stereotypical forms and utterly weird scenes that leave you thinking how on earth did they come up with that. Admittedly this film definitely wouldn't be enjoyable for everyone but for people like me into dark and over the top humor. Many scenes left me losing my breath from laughter (especially towards the end) and shocked in a brilliant way as to how they came up with such creative and unique jokes. I particularly enjoyed the small backstories as to what the supermarkets were originally like and how they were very much linked to real events such as sauerkraut (a typical German food) being portrayed as Nazis in their past reign.Bad: Although Seth rogen did a brilliant job at creating this story and hilarious jokes. For me him and many of the other voice actors were not fitting well with their characters. I felt like the larger stars such as Jonah hill were not assigned the right role for their usual style of character. I also felt as if there was very little attention added to the other hot dogs and buns closely involved with the story seeing as they were friends with the two main characters and shown being taken to the customers house to meet their fate.Aside from the comedic scenes created from the plot, i found that the story was very slow going and dragged on a while but was fortunately excelled in the big finale which was brilliantly executed.Summary: this film is worth the watch unless you are easily offended and will gather a large amount of laughs throughout the film.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Terrible!!,"I knew this movie was going to be crud and childish but the writers of this movie need to see a therapist. I think every other word was the F word coupled with a reference to a sexual body part. I loved ""neighbors"" and ""this is the end"" but this movie took everything way way way too far!! I was so exited to see this movie but was extremely let down. I think all of the positive reviews are in some way fake or paid reviews. I will never watch or go to another one of their movies again.

Absolutely Hilarious. See this movie.,"Every time Seth Rogan comes out with a new movie I've doubted it. Then when I watch his films (aside from The Interview) I always find them hilarious. So I brought my wife and we loved it. It was much better in theaters because all of the people laughing around us made it all the more enjoyable. (especially a scene at the end)Without spoiling anything, the animation was great, the voice acting, characters, story, and above all writing. Seth Rogan, Evan Goldberg, and Jonah Hill hit it out of the park. I really enjoyed this film. Again, everyone should consider going in theaters. I never see comedy in theaters but it made it better.This is definitely one of Seth Rogan and Evan Goldberg's best. Absolutely worth it.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Seth Rogen serves up a filthy, funny 'Sausage Party'","The makers of the movie proudly proclaim it the first R-rated computer-animated comedy and do not mistake ""Sausage Party"" for a kids' film, regardless of how cute the advertising may appear. The film is not quite smart enough to overcome the clichés and stereotypes it acknowledges but can't entirely dismantle. A violent, sexy, crazy action about supermarket products that rebel against their human consumers, Sausage Party is one of the funniest and most deeply offensive movies of the year (it's obscenely funny). Seth Rogen proved that he is genius in adult comedy even in an animation. I go with 3.5/5 for 'Sausage Party'.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Flat-out Disgusting and Corrupt.,"Honestly this movie was so sick. I watched the trailer, I knew there would be cussing and perversion-- but there was TOO much of it. I kid you not, 99% of every sentence in this film had an overuse of cuss words. The perversion was completely overdone and out of hand. It wasn't funny, just flat out disgusting. Save your money and don't watch it in theaters or on Netflix, just watch it online for free when it's out if you really want to see it... but I and there other 6 friends I went to see it with highly recommend you don't. The stuff they promote is sick. So corrupt. The first few minutes of the film you're fine, but get a little startled at the amount of cussing you hear. People who normally cuss don't even cuss that much, so it wasn't realistic. 20 minutes in and you're in utter shock by what you see. As the movie continues to progress, you'll find yourself horrified and struck by disbelief. It's awkward and so WRONG-- all of it! I mean you see rape here! Murder! Threesomes! Drug abuse! And let's not even get started about the blasphemy and complete disregard of faith in God. I walked out. I couldn't finish watching and nor did I want to.

"Grotesque, Even for Rogen Fans, but It's Endlessly Entertaining","As entertaining as it is to watch food be voiced by Seth Rogen's squad, Sausage Party becomes increasingly grotesque and uncomfortable with every scene. Though I will say the ending may be one of 2016's greatest treasures.Along the same lines as Toy Story and Secret Life of Pets, we just had to know what every type of food and drink were thinking as we grabbed them off the shelf at a market. On paper, this is exactly what I would want Rogen and his writers to tackle. There's something about a sausage and a bun try to escape a market that seemed to fit what Rogen has done in the past. To be fair, they take it in all the directions you would hope they would go and tell all the jokes and innuendos you would expect, but sometimes it's just a little too much.Filled with endless amounts of talent both voicing and behind the camera, Sausage Party always keeps you entertained. There's never really a dull moment on screen, but as the film progresses, those moments just become overdone gags and jokes that tend to take things just one step too far. It's not that I ever wanted realism with this type of premise, but I would have hoped for a little more subtly in certain areas.With all this said, I pretty much got out of it exactly what the trailer sold me. Putting aside the amazing Saving Private Ryan tribute that was shown in the trailer, there's plenty of other pop culture and movie references that put a smile on my face as well. Plus, getting Academy Award level talent like Edward Norton, Salma Hayek, and composer Alan Menken to come on board this ridiculous romp is pretty dang awesome.If you liked the trailer, I think you'll enjoy Sausage Party. It's fast paced and has several insane moments that make the theater experience all the more surreal. The gags go on for too long and the story suffers, so it isn't the most even Rogen pic, but it's worth watching for sure.+Always entertaining+Movie references and tributes+Voice talent-Keeps pushing the same jokes and gags-A little bit too grotesque6.5/10",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Though Slow Moving, a Bizarre Plot makes it a Winner,","Sausage Party is a good movie with a reasonably well developed plot and a terrific voice cast. It is a very strange movie, without a doubt the weirdest one you will see all year, as we follow a group of talking food in a super market who soon learn the truth about their existence, it certainly was special to see an R rated animated film.The cast is the highlight for me, Seth Rogen and Kristen Wiig shine in the lead roles, there is some great, unrecognizable, voice work done by the likes of Edward Norton, Bill Hader, Nick Kroll and Jamee Franco.The film was, on the other hand, very slow moving, it is mainly set in the supermarket, which can make it feel a bit tiresome, and it tends to go back over the same points over and over again.It should have been more outlandish, the only scenes that truly deliver the absurdity you would expect was the musical number and the scene at the end, other than that it a bit flat. The humour relied too heavily on sex and drugs, it should put more emphasise on parodying animated Disney films, something that Rogen said the film would do, although the only thing that really did so was the song.I do feel that this film's success will bringer better projects now that people can see that it is profitable, there is a sequel set up at the end with a plot line that is very meta and exciting, I look forward to seeing what Rogen has up his sleeves. It is more flawed than I would have hoped, but Sausage Party is wildly funny and unlike any other movie, worth the watch if you are looking for a good comedy.A group of food in a supermarket, waiting to be chosen by the Gods, soon discover the shocking truth of their existence.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
imaginative obscenity,"Shopwell's Grocery Store has all the products. Unknown to the humans, the products are alive. They believe that people are Gods. When they get picked, they go out to the heaven-like Great Beyond. Frank Wienerton (Seth Rogen) is a wiener and Brenda Bunson (Kristen Wiig) is a hot dog bun. They are overjoyed to be picked but they fall out of the shopping cart. With Kareem Abdul Lavash (David Krumholtz) and Sammy Bagel Jr. (Edward Norton), they go in search for the truth. They are joined by Teresa del Taco (Salma Hayek) and hunted by the evil Douche (Nick Kroll). Meanwhile, deformed sausage Barry (Michael Cera) arrives in the kitchen and discovers the true nature of the Great Beyond.There is no arguing that this is imaginative and obscene. It gets full marks for being ridiculously childish and high satire at the same time. Its originality wears thin after awhile. I think it has a lot to do with the constant swearing. It never stops and everybody does it. There is a childish glee that is derived from it at first but it becomes a crutch for the humor. I also would have liked for the group to stay together. There is so much wackiness that any additional chaos is not necessarily welcomed.

"So Bad, I walked out... and I never walk out.","I loved the beginning of Seth Rogen's career. I love raunchy humor and adult cartoons. But... After the 10th ""let me put my sausage into your bun"" sex joke, I was done. It wasn't REALLY funny the first time, much less the 10th. All the innuendos were VERY tired and overdone. I felt my brain melting and getting stupider the longer I sat there. I was embarrassed to even be seen in this theatre.Nowadays, I keep asking myself how Rogen keeps getting hired to make movies at all. He hasn't done anything funny in years. Then I look at the box office receipts and get my answer. LOTS of people actually pay money to watch this dude NOT be funny. He must have a HUGE following of 12-15 year old boys who sneak into the movies. Because I can't imagine anyone with any level of maturity liking this.Sausage Party was just plain bad. I wanted to like it. I was eager to watch. But this... I just don't have time for it. If I was a teenager, maybe. But I'm just not the core audience for this garbage.

The writers are interested in being progressive by a lot of the dialogue, yet by the same token make fun of a large group of people by using the same types of stereotypes.

Adults only,"A terribly vulgar picture that was developed by the great master of toilet humor, Seth Rogen, for almost ten years.At first glance, it may seem that apart from the swearing that flows in a thick, fetid stream from the lips of the characters, and the dirty jokes that the main characters of the cartoon make at every step, there is nothing. But it is not so. In addition to parodies of several films, for example, ""Ratatouille"" or ""Saving Private Ryan,"" the scriptwriters take a good look at existential crisis and religion. Faith in a better world for almost all heroes without exception, faith in the infallibility of people who will show the way to a bright paradise, where every sausage will get a soft bun, will turn into a terrible discovery that their fate will be inevitable and terrible - they will be stupidly eaten. Food will ultimately come to the conclusion that gods do not exist, that there is life only here and now, that you need to get everything from it while you can.The animated film is okay, quite funny and capable of making you laugh, but only if you're up for some rough and offensive humor.

Sausage Party: A Hilarious Descent into Food-Based Frenzy,"Imagine a grocery store aisle where the vegetables plot rebellion, the condiments wrestle with existential dread, and the hot dogs, well, they just wanna get to the Great Beyond (the hot dog bun slicer, that is). Welcome to the delightfully outrageous world of Sausage Party, a film that throws caution (and common decency) to the wind for a laugh-a-minute ride through the supermarket underworld.This is not your grandma's Disney cartoon, folks. Sausage Party cranks the raunch factor up to eleven, peppering its dialogue with enough profanity to make a sailor blush and jokes so crude they'd make a bagel wince. It's the kind of movie where a lavatory humor pun rubs shoulders with a surprisingly insightful existential crisis, all delivered with the animation quality of a Saturday morning cartoon on a sugar rush.Think Toy Story meets South Park, with a generous dollop of Monty Python thrown in for good measure. The humor is unapologetically crass, but often surprisingly clever. You'll groan, you'll chuckle, you might even snort out loud at some of the sheer audacity of it all. It's the kind of movie that leaves you wondering, ""Did they really just go there?"" And the answer, my friends, is usually a resounding ""Yes, yes they did.""However, beneath the barrage of bodily fluid jokes and food-based innuendo lies a surprisingly thought-provoking core. The film explores themes of faith, purpose, and the nature of existence, albeit through the lens of talking hot dogs and bagels. It's a bizarre mix, to be sure, but one that somehow manages to work, leaving you pondering the meaning of life one toilet wine joke at a time.So, should you watch this meaty masterpiece? Well, that depends. If you have a penchant for the absurd, an iron stomach for potty humor, and an open mind about animated grocery items questioning their very being, then Sausage Party is a wild ride you won't forget (or possibly forgive yourself for enjoying).

Time I'm not getting back,"Normally I like watching 15/18 rated stuff like Big Mouth, South Park, Family Guy etc but this film is the most unfunny film I've seen in a long time. It's just a series of overused F Bombs. The jokes just don't resonate with me as much as they are so boring it's the type of puerile humour I would've found funny when I was probably 10 or 11.If you're like me who likes watching shows like South Park, Family Guy, Big Mouth, Beavis and Butthead or anything like that please don't bother with Sausage Party it's pretty much an 18/R rated version of the god awful film everyone hates the Emoji Movie.",1.0,Anonymous,Animation
'Sausage Party' – Finally an Animated Feature for Adults,"As a parent, I see more than my fair share of animated features. To be honest, I love movies so I don't really mind. Still, 'Sausage Party' is a refreshing–and long overdue–change of pace. Finally there's an R-rated, full-length animated feature for adults. OK, maybe it's for adults with a somewhat juvenile sense of humor–but adults nonetheless.I spoke with the directors--Greg Tiernan and Conrad Vernon--about the experience. As I suspected, the initial concept was pitched by Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg. I imagined Rogen was high and started pondering how the food on the shelves feels, and then BOOM! Artistic genius. It was interesting to learn how much raunchier the movie COULD have been, and how they had to cut scenes to bring it down to rated R.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Worst film ever,"This film made me not laugh the rest of the day thats how unfunny this is a couple of the ideas are kinda funny but it is not preformed well at all this isn't even stupid funny like adult swim shows or other obsurd comedies I cannot see the appeal for anyone to like this film Its not even so bad its good it just stinks I know comedy is subjective but this is objective unfunny it is painful to watch and has little redeeming quality and it even has decent animation but that's the only good thing about the film the people who made it where all high while writing it. This tries to be like a adult swin show or something but atleast adult swim shows are atleast funny sometimes a lot of them are very funny but this is garbage I hate it and I cannot understand how anyone could like this film

Never seen anything like this before....,"Prepare thyself. Sausage Party is unlike anything anyone has ever seen. This animated comedy is HARD R rated. By far the most explicit adult animation ever made. So please if you're going to watch then don't allow the children to be in on it. The movie starts off at a supermarket where we see all kinds of food items singing a song praising the ""gods"" (humans), because they believe the ""gods"" are good and nice and will give them everything they've ever dreamed of in ""the great beyond"". They all believe that ""the great beyond"" is when humans purchase them and bring them home with them. They soon find out though that this fantasy is completely false. The main characters are Frank the sausage (Seth Rogen) and Brenda the Bun (Kristen Wiig). They are in love and I liked wiig and rogen voicing them, good casting. All the hot dog wieners want to ""fill"" the hot dog buns in the great beyond. Fancy way of saying they want to have sex and lots of it. The comedy in the film is pretty hit and miss lots of the time. The movie is 1 hour and 20 minutes and I laughed three times. That is why I say it's hit and miss. The majority of the comedy stems from extremely crass/crude material, and very sexually explicit material as well. Sexual jokes and potty humor abounds. And so does profanity. F**k, s**t, c**k, c**t, absolutely nothing is left unused as far as cursing goes, so just be prepared and know that that's what you're in for with Sausage Party. I didn't mind the cursing at all, I never really do with any movie, although I did mind the unoriginality to a lot of the comedy. A lot of the comedy is just very middle school, I think a lot of the times the writers just injected extreme cursing to get laughs. And that just wasn't very funny. I liked the characters and I thought the movie was funny a few times. Another thing I liked was how they handled the plot, it was surprisingly thought provoking. It's all about questioning what you've been fed as far as religion goes, actually looking into things for yourself, not just believing something blindly. And that's a good lesson. But then.... after a good message at its heart is displayed, there's a full fledged food orgy. Complete with thrusting, moaning, masturbation, BDSM, oral sex, and other stuff.... With all of this considered I give Sausage Party a 6/10. A few funny moments and some good characters, but there are better options.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Truly shocking in the best of ways.,"Sausage Party is directed by Greg Tiernan & Conrad Vernon and stars Seth Rogen, Kristen Wiig, Jonah Hill, Bill Hader, Michael Cera, James Franco, Danny McBride, Craig Robinson, Paul Rudd & Edward Norton.A sausage strives to discover the truth about his existence.Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg are one of the best duos in comedy filmmaking. Their humour is focused heavily on gross-out situations, over-the-top performances and somewhat relatable characters. Having watched their movies - Superbad, Pineapple Express & This Is The End, for example - many times, I knew I had to see this. I was not disappointed. Sausage Party features all of the crazy stuff you'd come to expect from the duo, yet packing in moments that will genuinely surprise you.The writing is ridiculously fun, fast-paced and outrageous. I think partly what makes it so much more enjoyable is the animation. It's supposed to look and feel like a children's movie, but you couldn't be more wrong. With the ecstatic performances from all the cast throughout, it delivers for the most part. Though a majority of the jokes are brilliant, there were moments were it seemed unimaginative, almost bland in taste. That said, seconds later another character will jump in to save the scene. So although it's not completely fluent in translation, it's a fairly decent comedy flick.Music by Christopher Lennertz & Alan Menken is pretty average, though you couldn't ask for more with such a movie. The opening song/theme is tightly written and composed, introducing you to the world our characters live in very nicely. Overall, an unnoticeable addition to the feature, but by no means a bad one. Lennertz is actually one of the best composers in the comedy genre, so whoever was in control and made that decision did a good job.Highlighting Seth, Kristen and Jonah for their seemingly 'off-the-cuff' portrayals, absolutely stealing the show and bringing the laughs. From the beginning to end, these characters truly shocking in the best of ways. I advise against watching the trailers, as a few of the better scenes are featured, however this won't completely ruin the surprise. There's still a lot of crazy, disgusting, vulgar writing by Seth, Evan and Jonah that must be experienced. I use those descriptive words in the 'pre-eminent' sense.This movie definitely isn't for everyone, but fans of Rogen & Goldberg will almost certainly approve.Verdict; Sausage Party is an extremely unique take on the comedy genre and while sometimes the humour may lack, the story, somewhat ostentatious animation and shocking pay-off will leave you with some confusing afterthoughts whilst grinning.Sausage Party, 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

A special kind of humour,"This is an animated story about the lives of some food that believes that when they leave the supermarket they enter Nirvana.This has quite a heavy Seth Rogen vibe about it. Expect a lot of lewd and inappropriate humour.The main character is a sausage who wants to enter Nirvana inside his hot-dog bun girlfriend.There are lots of clever play-on-words as well as a smattering of not so clever ones.I wasn't expecting a lot from this, and it was quite offensive, but I did find it quite funny and was an easy enough watch.The film reaches a high point about two thirds in then gets seriously dumb. The ending is absolutely rubbish. I wrote a similar ending for a story at school when I was about seven and my teacher made me rewrite it on the grounds it was utter cack.Not a great film but if you are a Seth Rogen fan you are sure to like this.

Too far into the lewd territory for my own liking - I didn't hate it though,"Those scenes at the end... they really went for it!'Sausage Party' is as dumb a film as you'll find, it's purely nonsensical and extremely crass at times - pretty stereotypical too. Even with that being true, it does have some amusing gags in there; it got a few laughs out of me. It's uneasy, yet somewhat refreshing, to see an animated film be so raunchy. They do take it too far though, especially at the conclusion.Seth Rogen is the lead as Frank, he is exactly what you'd expect from a Rogen character; drugs et al. There are a number of other well-known names, from James Franco to Salma Hayek to Jonah Hill to Kristen Wiig. I can't say any of them stand out in my memory, admittedly. Animation-wise I found it fine.I commend them for going the full distance with this, but that probably harms the film in the long run. Adult animated films definitely have an open market and it would be cool to see it rise, but this film takes it too far into the lewd territory for my own liking - I didn't hate it though.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
A lot of rawness but nowhere near enough sauce,"The concept was a pretty intriguing one and unlike any other concept personally seen before. Reading the very polarising reviews, mostly from audiences that had people defending it and others hating it with a passion, and being aware of what kind of humour there'll be and what to expect, there was no trouble knowing what to let myself in for.'Sausage Party', after seeing it, is not as bad as has been made out by those who hated it (understandably), there are redeeming qualities here and there are far worse animated films out there that are much more cheaply made, poorly conceived and offensive in their lack of quality. 'Sausage Party', with that being said, also could have been much more, an intriguing and unique concept with severely under-cooked and muddled execution. Crude, juvenile humour doesn't always offend me and am constantly saying how annoying the constantly spouted ""it's a kid's movie"" cliché needs to be nipped in the bud.It's wholly dependent on how the crude, juvenile humour is executed, 'South Park' is as crude, as bold and as controversial as one can possibly get but executes its very satirical, daring and takes-no-prisoners humour much more sharply and cleverly. How 'Sausage Party' executes its crude, juvenile humour is instead excessive, repetitive and gratuitous.Certainly there are good things. Have no qualms about the animation, which is rich in detail, colourful and quite inventive in places. The soundtrack is catchy. The voice cast is good, and even they alone are reason enough for anybody to know what to let themselves in for (Seth Rogan and Kristin Wiig are no strangers to the humour seen in 'Sausage Party').Nick Kroll and Edward Norton, the latter's dead-on channelling of Woody Allen being the most inspired the film gets, are particularly good. Rogan and Wiig also bring personality to their roles. There are parts that are inspired and equally horrifying and hilarious, like the scene with the can of spaghetti spoofing 'Saving Private Ryan', and some witty dialogue but it's Norton's Allen channelling that provides the biggest laughs.However, too much of 'Sausage Party's' writing falls flat. The cussing and sexual raunchy innuendos epitomise excessive and gratuitous (some of it is very out of place as well), while the vulgarity is not as witty or as clever as it likes to think and some of it is very repetitive. The dialogue makes one cringe more than laugh and completely lacks wit or fun, it's just dumb and insipid.For all the voice cast's best efforts, the characters are either bland or annoying with little personality or development. 'Sausage Party' started off well but wore thin quickly and felt very over-stretched. It's not a long film, but the thinner the concept got the more of a long haul it felt. The story does not have enough to sustain the length and apart from a few moments of genuine inspiration it's dull and under-cooked to the point of rawness and with not enough fun to give it sauce.Overall, not that bad but rather lacklustre and could have been so much more. Loved the concept, no matter how silly it could easily have been, was underwhelmed by the wanting execution. The low rating is with regret, and with knowledge that, along with the other less-than-positive reviews, will be blasted by those vehemently, ignorantly and condescendingly defending the film (thinking that only their opinion is right and everybody else is wrong). 4/10 Bethany Cox",4.0,Anonymous,Animation
Sausage Party review,"Sausage party brought in a whole new kind of movie into the film industry. It is the first ever R- rated CG-animated film. Because of this, it created much hype around the country as many people were dying to see this movie when it first came out. Unfortunately, it did not live up to the hype. As matter of fact, it didn't even come close. Not only is the movie disgusting and corny, it's just not very funny.The movie opens with all the items in the store singing a song dedicated to the gods. These gods are humans who arrive every day to shop and buy these items and supposedly take them to ""The Great Beyond."" Seth Rogan stars as Frank, a hot dog in a package of eight. As all the items start singing in the morning when the market opens, one can hear Rogan's horrifying laugh to start off the movie on a bad note. The tone and enthusiasm in Rogan's voice in the first scene indicates that the whole movie is going to be the obnoxious laugh of the sausage Frank. As the movie progresses, it only proves this point to be correct. Towards the end of this movie, Franks laugh is like hearing nails on a chalkboard repeatedly. It's hard to have bad acting in an animated movie, but Sausage Party accomplished that.Yes, swearing food is humorous at first, but the 100th time a sausage curses in a ten-minute scene seems to be a bit excessive. The language chosen in this movie loses its originality after the first two scenes when cursing food becomes the ordinary. By the time the movie hit the last scene, I was worn out of food items cursing and having sex, praying the movie will finally be over soon.The overall plot of Sausage Party had some potential. Making a movie of this degree though is asking for failure. With this plot, the movie would have had to have been directed and produced brilliantly to make Sausage Party worthwhile to go see. This did not happen. The whole movie is a herd of food items swearing at each other while a hot dog and bun go on a quest to make love. One can tell at the start of the movie that the film will end with them eventually being together, making the movie very predictable and not suspenseful. It's a rare site to see a movie like this nail it, and you can add another check mark in the loss column.So ask yourself. Should you go see this movie because of it's one of a kind nature? I would say no. The film was put together by two people who live in the same fantasy. The film wants you to see it the way they do and live in the fantasy with them. I can tell you from experience that this is a very hard task. The acting, language, and plot scared me away from liking this movie. A faulty movie is not made better by cursing vegetables or horny sausages'. It's still simply an inadequately made movie.",,Anonymous,Animation
The supermarket is their world and uprising to liberate it.,"How many R rated animated films have you seen? This is not a hentai, but the Hollywood's rare animated-adult-comedy. Most of the big names are here, especially the young generation. The film took me by a surprise. I did not know when it was made and what its genre, but the posters made me very curious the with double meaning punchlines. It was a silly story, something like a parody of Pixar's 'Toy Story', but a very enjoyable film as it is a rare product.If you check the last two decade's records, the animation films tore apart the live-action films in the box office clash. It is shocking, but the fact that animations make good revenue. This film is a trend setter in animation genre that targets the adult audience. Like Hollywood found its counterpart from the Japanese hentai. It just cost only $20 million to make and the production quality was not very standard, but acceptable. Hope there will be more like this in the future, but I would seek a sequel for this.Seth Rogen was the main man behind this film. The rest of the cast too was good. Nothing but theirs voice lending made all the difference, especially you would know who were who, while a watch, that kind of familiar it was. The story of supermarket products from all the categories who fight for their freedom.I really enjoyed, it was short too, as well as a fast narration with some good adult jokes. There are a couple of negatives about it, like the first one was there's no innovation in it, like it is very familiar, but a different kind of comedy. And the next one was all the characters, I mean the supermarket products are American. So if you are a non-American, nearly 90 per cent you won't get what those items are. The adults should watch this, because I don't know when you will get another one like this in the future. So I definitely favour it.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Not a bad way to end this terrible Summer,"Normally my reviews are very lengthy so this one I'll try to keep short.I've been waiting a long time for a decently written movie addressing the absurdity of societal prejudice. I finally received what I've been praying to the almighty Lucky Frog for.What I appreciated most out of this movie was not just the horrific brutality shown towards multiple forms of prejudices but the non- religious way they accomplished just that.A major theme throughout the movie did not seem to me that religion is a bad thing and should never be. Instead what I got out of this movie was that religion was simply no longer necessary.Too many people fear the hellish depravity humanity will fall into without religion telling them how to govern their own and others' lives. ""Sausage Party"" maims this laughable notion in a very laughable way!Highly enjoyable, I don't recommend it if you love religion too much to laugh at yourself.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Yuck! Now I know why I hate sausage.,"Movie has the same ingredients as the wiener. Full of pig lips and edible plastic fillers. Still, Seth Rogen and his crew certainly know how to exploit the dumb movie genre and line their pockets on this garbage.So how did I end up in the theater watching it? Because my nephew turned 17 and that's what he wanted to see for his birthday. Of course he loved it and I suspect many his age do. Goes to show how the Beavis and Butthead formula can just be recycled over and over again for each naive up and coming generation. A generation that seems to have less brain cells than the generation before them. Are we finally seeing the consequences of feeding our youth too much GMO foods? Perhaps.I also have to be completely honest, if I see Seth Rogen's name on a film, I avoid it like a bad taco. I just don't find him funny or appealing. In truth, I find his work mediocre and banal. So I'm bias toward anything that has his name on it. But even so, the film still sucked.... big time. It's not even a film, it's a ridiculously awful cartoon!

Sausage party was a complete disappointment. Viewer be warned. The satirical bash on religion is the strongest I've ever seen,"After watching the trailer and then watching this movie, I feel that I have been completely lied to. In my opinion, the only good parts of the movie were the parts shown in the trailer, leaving the movie goer misinformed of the actual plot and strong satirical base.If you are a person who believes in any higher power, I would strongly recommend skipping this movie. The plot and satire on religion was so strong that I felt physically ill while watching this movie. Although there is an occasional funny scene the constant language and sexuality displayed do not leave room for any punch. It is way over played and detracts from the comedy.If I could rate this movie using integers, I would give it a negative ten.

If someone asked me what is the most explicit movie in Rated R, it will always be Sausage Party.Sure there are other ""extreme"" movies like TED or The Dictator, however this movie is at the peak of adult level humor. It contains essentially everything to fans of nasty level humor. The casual racism, sexual innendos, the hyper aggressive insulting, violence beyoned comprehension, the list goes on and on. Instead of hating on this movie, people should be impressed Sauage Party has achieved the incorporation of many themes while not being convoluted.The story is damn straight simple, probably as easy as any family friendly movie.

Simultaneous the most clever and stupidly obscene movie you might ever see,"Only Seth Rogen, Evan Goldberg and Jonah Hill could come up with something as ingenious and totally stupid as an animated film that imagines what would happen if food was self-aware and learned of its true purpose.Rogen and Goldberg – along with Hill and all their other pals, you know who they are – have long owned the the stoner comedy market, and ""Sausage Party"" is their most ambitious means of pedaling drug and dick humor to their audience yet. At least the sheer amount of creativity required to bring this film to life provides a satisfying balance to its excessive and pointlessly foul parts.In ""Sausage Party,"" all the foods at the ShopWell supermarket believe their destiny is to be chosen by the gods (humans) to be taken to ""the great beyond"" past the sliding glass doors, where they'll be loved and cared for. For hotdog Frank (Rogen) and bun Brenda (Kristen Wiig), who sit next to each other on the shelf, the opportunity to be chosen together means they can  yeah. But when a returned jar of honey mustard (Danny McBride) starts screaming that it's all a lie, he sends Frank and Brenda – and some other food friends – on a quest for the truth.The supporting characters include a constantly bickering Bagel (Edward Norton doing his best Woody Allen impression) and Lavash (David Krumholtz), whose arguments dip a bit far into Israeli- Palestinian conflict territory, a deformed hotdog named Barry (Michael Cera), a sexually questioning Taco (Selma Hayek), a Douche in the literal and figurative sense (Nick Kroll) and a few non- perishable foods who take hits from a kazoo to numb them from the truth. Our heroes journey to various aisles from the nightlife in the liquor section to a saloon full of Mexican foods.Rogen and Goldberg, who co-scripted with ""The Night Before"" writers Kyle Hunter and Ariel Shaffir, are clearly after a parody of Pixar films, which often build clever, unseen worlds. (There are even a couple direct references to the animation giant.) In many instances, ""Sausage Party"" manages to capture that same degree of imagination, only they twist it to their perverted purposes.A key component is matching the level of visual artistry as those films is the hiring of animation directors. Conrad Vernon is one of the trusted names at DreamWorks Animation (""Shrek 2,"" ""Monsters vs. Aliens""), while Greg Tiernan has directed a couple dozen ""Thomas & Friends"" videos. The two know the techniques that create the look and feel of a film on this scale and can sell this kind of concept to an audience. Doubtless they enjoyed employing their skills to delinquent ends.How one can be so simultaneous impressed and disgusted by the cleverness of a film is easily the crowning achievement of ""Sausage Party."" It's as relentlessly creative as it is relentlessly abhorrent. It even has a feel-good message as it descends into obscenity. Ultimately, however, most movies this outrageous don't even have half as many good things that can be said about them, which makes ""Sausage Party"" among one of the better ones by default.~Steven CThanks for reading.

Terrible Movie,"I was actually thinking this might be a good cartoon. I enjoy a good cartoon like like all 3 of the kung fu panda movies, the Ice Age movies, Toy Story, etc etc. I found I could be entertained by them. They had a good story, whit, comedy and great animation. This one had none of those. What it did have in it was F bombs and expletives in just about every sentence. And it was clear that was the main focus of this movie to keep that pace all the way through. It got really old after about 5 minutes. I guess they all thought that was going to be the comedy by just using those words over and over and over again throughout the entire movie. I can imagine them sitting down over a script to see how of them they put in the shortest space possible. In high school I could cuss with the best of them but even then there a lot of people who took it to the extreme where they could not talk without cussing. Always irritated me a bit to talk to people who were like that. Many of them had almost no vocabulary at all without the cuss words. I downloaded the movie to watch and couldn't bring myself to finish it. I lasted probably 20 minutes hoping it would tone down a bit but it never did. I guess everyone involved in making this junk movie just thought it was going to look cool to be able to cuss all the way through the movie with no restriction and thought that would be enough to carry the film. This movie was not a bit funny to me despite the over used f bombs. Then they got all these actors to fall in this nonsense. I guess a bucks a bucks cause I sure can't see a higher calling than that. This movie was just bad, and they actually tried pretty hard to make it bad.",1.0,Anonymous,Animation
Sausage Party,"Sausage Party is the latest Seth Rogen project that has been on my radar since the concept was announced. Imagining a raunchy Toy Story with the brain of Rogen behind it was quite appealing to me, and this movie delivered on all cylinders.Not only is Sausage Party hilarious, it is also oddly philosophical. Following the journey of Frank (Rogen), the film delves into topics such as the afterlife and sacred texts. At times the film is as downright preachy as the fiery evangelicals that Rogen and Goldberg skewer, causing the film to get bogged down toward the third act due to Rogen obsessing over every flaw of organized religion. Overall Rogen ends the film on a more open minded note, redeeming the message he is so adamant on sharing.The true star here is the writing, as the film cleverly uses every food pun imaginable all while balancing it with a solid story. Inventive is the greatest compliment one can give this film due to its hilarious cast bringing to life a wide array of characters, withe Nick Kroll taking the cake as the most fitting voice casting choice. Although falling flat on a number of jokes, the film picks itself back up quickly for a doozy of an ending that anyone watching this film will never forget.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

"Juvenile, but with some Hidden Depths","A fun dark comedy about the insane premise of sentient food struggling through an existential crisis of being eaten by humans. As usual for most Seth Rogan comedies, the comedy is pretty hit-or-miss with an unhealthy reliance on cheap stoner humor, excessive swearing, intercourse jokes, and shock value. However, there is a surprising layer of thoughtful commentary on the affects of religion as a means of a coping mechanism against our inevitable mortality. How it can be used for good or evil, depending on who wields the power of prophecy. And how atheists must be careful to not push away their theistic loved ones or else suffer a fate of loneliness. However, the blatant mistreatment of the animators is disgusting and should be condemned. Overall, I laughed more times than I cringed, so ultimately I'd recommend this as long as you have decent stomach for Seth Rogan's raunchy comedies.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
The Last Scene Ruined It For Me,"When I knew that an animation–comedy movie have the writing contribution and the voice of Seth Rogen, I was directly drowned to it. For me Rogen is one of the big masters of comedy that we have today, and that was enough for me to view this piece. Above that fact we have the well-respected Eduard Norton voice on the cast, plus the irreverent Jonah Hill, Salma Hayek and James Franco, all great and talented names in the business. However, in my opinion this doesn't make this work an enjoyable movie, because although we just expect a lot of bad words, this was too much! And we watch a constant list of low level sentences throughout the film for no reason. It aren't funny nor is needed to the development of the story. On the other hand, the concept of bring the food to life, and also the inherent feelings, dreams, goals and perspectives are a brilliant idea, but the dialog/ scrip and specifically the last scene ruined it for me.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Willie Wurst,"Astonishingly this R rated vulgar CGI adult cartoon is a lot better than my initial low expectations I had of it.In fact it really is some kind of rude, crude version of Toy Story with an anti-religious subtext as food products in the supermarket come alive, waiting to be selected by humans but not realising that a worse fate awaits them. They will be cooked and eaten.The film starts with a Disney lite song (written by Alan Menken) and is about a hot dog who falls in love with the attractive hot dog bun, just the right fit for him and once he discovers the truth he needs to get back to the supermarket and warn the others of what life outside the supermarket really is like. There is another product whose nozzle was damaged that goes after the hot dog as he blames him for his deformity.The makers play with stereotypes such as the Jewish Bagel, all calm and pacifist and the Arab Lavash being arrogant and rather old fashioned but honourable underneath. You have the German beers who are horrible to the juice.There is a sexy taco who also has the hots for the hot dog bun but that means a same sex relationship which is taboo. However the film ends with a literal food orgy, straight, bi, gay.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation

Satire animated film that leaves you to question everything you buy at the supermarket.,"Sausage Party is unlike any animated movie I've ever seen. Having seen the trailer before I had a hunch of what was to be expected and yet I wasn't prepared. Being familiar with Seth Rogen's work the humor wasn't too vulgar for me.The idea of talking food is brilliant and the setting for the story to evolve is a good one. What makes this movie special is not the story itself, but the satire and twisted humor that follows. Had it been told among humans instead I don't believe it would have been as special.This is definitely not suited for kids! From an adults point of view it's a hilarious film that rather makes you question yourself why you watched it in the first place. The last twenty minutes was anything but leaving you in a state of shock.I'm not going to recommend everyone to watch this movie, since it's humor won't definitely suit all. But, if you're keen on satire, twisted plot and a killing spree among food you should have a look!I like it, but not sure if it's worth a 7/10 rating.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
The most unorthodox comedy in recent history.,"Striving to offend as many minorities as possible without so much as a hint of subtlety, the Seth Rogen masterminded 'Sausage Party' is a razor-sharp animated feature that proudly competes with 'South Park: Bigger, Longer and Uncut' for the title of most distasteful R-rated cartoon. Everything from homosexuality to the Holocaust is targeted in this unashamedly disrespectful, though at times somewhat profound, mockery of Disney and Pixar's finest.Likely originating from the dulled neurons of a particularly stoned Hollywood actor, this film wears its influences proudly with its constant riff on the animation format, right down to the Alan Menken musical number. The result is a bizarre, surreal experience that somehow manages to exist as both a racial commentary and a religious allegory.Much like Pixar are consistently able to get so much mileage out of a single premise, 'Sausage Party' wastes no time in reeling out pun after pun, meaning that for every joke that doesn't impress, there is one mere seconds away that is bound to stick the landing. There are far too many visual gags to appreciate in one sitting, and chances are you'll be laughing so much that you'll miss many a good line.Rogen's associated acts, as per usual, are on board either as an effort to establish a stellar billing or merely because its convenient, and this reviewer is inclined to believe that it's the latter. Ultimately there is no real charm to the casting; whereas the relaxed nature of these performers essentially playing themselves worked in 'This Is The End', here it is more of a distraction. It speaks volumes that, apart from Edward Norton's standout as a Jewish bagel, the only other player seemingly having fun with their role is one of the storyboard artists.In a bold effort to be thoroughly crude and overly offensive, 'Sausage Party' succeeds in abundance by throwing everything including the kitchen sink at the wall and watching what sticks. The end product is the most unorthodox comedy in recent history - a simple barrel of laughs that still manages to leave you scratching your head at the end - but it's also some of the best work that Rogen and his contemporaries have ever put out.",,Anonymous,Animation
Seth Rogan does 3D,"Sausage Party is a Seth Rogan film, indeed, in the closing credits he appears several times, and that's the problem. Even though the animation is as clever as anything you'll see out of Dreamworks or Pixar, this is still a Seth Rogan film with, now, very familiar style of humour. I did laugh out loud once, and to be fair, the animation (if not the humour) was sufficiently inspiring for me to see the movie through to the end. Hollywood as well as Britain has a similar problem with comedy that is does with sci-fi, in particular superheroes, zombies and anything initially successful, in that it will endlessly repeat such successful themes. From America come Adam Sandler and Will Ferrell comedies, one after another, which to some of us appear more of the same. From Britain come huge sex-based comedies such as Little Britain. Seth Rogan comedies follow a similar pattern, although his movies This Is The End (2013) and The Interview (2014) did represent something classically different. In the same way Sausage Party represents something different again. It's still basically powered by massive sexual innuendo and stoner culture however, like almost all of his work. Much as I'm sure that that is exactly why people love him, for those that find such humour immature, then I think it important in a review to point out that that is still very much what one is getting into when you elect to see this show.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation

Sausage Party: An Observation of the Modern World,"Observation manages to combine all of the stereotypes shared by different cultures of one another, intertwine this with raunchy humor, ultimately painting a portrait of how intolerable this the planet is becoming.A few facts (for those whom would prefer NOT to hear the ramblings of a long- time film fanatic): The film has been estimated to have been built on a $19- million budget, grossing about $34-million opening weekend (USA). For your comparison: Finding Dori (2016) cost an estimated $200-million bringing in about $135-million opening weekend (USA). Whether a fan or not, there is clearly something to be said regarding the brilliance that is Seth Rogen.One thing is clear: this was hand-crafted by Rogen and therefore filled extensively by his observations and humor from start to finish. The script was something he had in the works for nearly ten years!I suspect many will turn away from this due to religious affiliation. I am an atheist but would stress that with all of the violence, racism, sexism, and every other ""ism"" in the world, that this was an attempt to address the way that many denominations and organizations are misunderstood by one another.A female coworker at my office came by on Monday morning to exclaim that it was indigent humor, and I quote ""racist."" To those who would even have the slightest inkling of accusing this work racist, you have completely misunderstood. In fact, one of the messages that could be drawn from watching this would have to do with the necessity for removing the ""racist"" culture and indirect racism that can be created through attempting to group individuals by religious affiliation or any other characteristics.DO NOT take your children. The entire run-time was packed with bad language, a ton of sexual innuendos, so you've been warned.Enjoy the film, appreciate the message, don't take anything personally. It was not the intent of Rogen or any other Directors/Writers.Oh, and just to make this ""review-worthy""... the film uses various Super Market foods, drinks, and items to represent humans incorporating the different stereotypes often heard of for numerous Religions, ethnic groups, and sexual preferences/identities. By using such simple characters, it attempts to put some of the world's problems onto the simplest of stages for the world to see and take in for themselves.----- 5/10 STARS -------- Review by Searsino -----",5.0,Anonymous,Animation

Quite funny in places! 6/10,"Review: What a crazy film! I really didn't expect this movie to have such foul language and sexual content, especially as it is an animation film. The concept was definitely original, and I doubt that the top studios, like Pixar, would ever make anything in this league but I can't see this film getting a wide audience, like some other animated movies would. Anyway, the movie is based on a hot dog type Sausage called Frank and a hot dog bun called Brenda, who are dying to go into the outside world, so they can get it on. Whilst on the supermarket shelves, the whole store believes that humans are gods, mainly because they take them into the outside to be free but a honey mustard jar returns to the shelves, after being mistakenly bought, and he tries to tell everyone about his bad experience in the outside world, which no one believes. During Honey Mustards outburst, the packet of Hot Dog buns and Hot Dogs, with Frank and Brenda in, are taken off the shelves by a consumer, and while Frank is trying to save Honey Mustard from committing suicide, the basket tips over, causing the contents to fall out of the basket. One of the baskets items, Douche, damages his nozzle, which falsies the manager to throw him in the bin, so he makes it his mission to destroy Frank and Brenda, who caused the basket to tip over. Whilst separated from there packets, Frank and Brenda join forces with Kareem Abdul Lavash and Sammy Bagel Jr. to make there way back to there department in the store but Frank wants to find out more about the outside world from Firewater, whose in the stores liquor aisle, so they take a quick detour and they wait for Frank to get his information. While Frank is smoking weed with Firewater, the rest of his crew are on the run from Douche, who has used his wicked ways to hunt them down but with the help of Teresa, a small taco, they manage to escape from Douche, and finally catch up with Frank, who tries to convince them that the outside world is pretty awful. Nobody wants to believe Frank about the so-called gods, so he uses the information that he got from Firewater, to get some proof and then he goes back to the market to show everyone what happens when they are taken off the shelves. Crazy but true! The movie then goes down an avenue of drugs, violence and an outrageous orgy, which is quite shocking if your not used to Seth Rogen's type of comedy. I did find the movie quite funny and the crazy plot was well put together but I did think that some of the scenes went a bit too far. It will change the way that you buy and cook food in the future, in a funny way but it's definitely not for kids, and some adults who will be offended by some of the jokes. If you don't take the movie seriously, you will find it fun, and it's one of those films that you can watch, to put you in a good mood but I doubt that it will go down as an all time classic. Enjoyable!Round-Up: With such a huge amount of actors supplying there voices to this risky comedy, I'm not surprised that the various characters brought different styles of comedy to the big screen, which made the movie work. It's directed by Greg Tiernan, who has directed Thomas and Friends cartoons since 2009, and he was the animation director for Happily N'Ever After. The other director, Conrad Vernon, 48, directed Shrek 2, Monsters vs. Aliens and Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted, so he was the perfect choice to bring Seth Rogen, Evan Goldberg and Jonah Hills story to the big screen. The animation was quite impressive, for a movie about food, and the expressions on the various characters faces, were spot on but the orgy scene really took it to another level. I personally can't a sequel in the near future, unless they name it Burger Party, so for a stand alone film, I would say that it was a decent achievement, which made a healthy profit.Budget: $19million Worldwide Gross: $140.5millionI recommend this movie to people who are into their animation/adventure/comedies, voiced by Seth Rogen, Kristen Wiig, Jonah Hill, Paul Rudd, Craig Robinson, Edward Norton, Danny McBride, Salma Hayek, Bill Hader, James Franco, Michael Cera, Nick Kroll, David Krumholtz and Anders Holm. 6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Animation

"Better Than Expected, But Still Not Anything Great","The trailer for this film broke the internet. For a while, everyone was talking about it and claiming that it was going to be the best comedy of 2016. I wasn't really in the same boat. While I thought the idea of anthropomorphic food items discovering the truth about their existence was a creative idea, I failed to see how well it would carry a feature film and felt like it would've been better off as a short on SNL or some other sketch show. But after seeing it....it was...better than expected. Although that doesn't make the movie amazing by default.Like I said earlier, the concept is pretty creative and they do surprisingly take a few advantages with it. There's some pretty creative ideas buried underneath and they try to work in some satire involving prejudice, immortality, and identity. They obviously don't go very deep in depth, but they do it decently for a film whose protagonist is a talking sausage.But the absolutely biggest flaw with this movie is the fact that it's not really that funny. By far this movie's biggest faults that bogs it down, is its jokes. While they're not necessarily terrible and there were only a few that I actually groaned at, nothing about them were really laugh out loud hilarious or even worth much more than just a small chuckle.While the film kind of fails in terms of comedy, I do at the very least give it props for its creativity. A good chunk of the satire works, it boasts a pretty imaginative concept, and the animation is actually pretty solid (despite the working condition controversy) that actually does add to the subject they're satirizing (Pixar.) So the film overall is just okay as a whole. It isn't great, but it is a lot more creative than it should be.6/10.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Vile Humor Yet Satisfying,"Sausage Party had some really raunchy scenes in it. I was actually surprised and horrified at times. It had many funny moments, though I cannot say it kept me involved throughout. The cast is friggin incredible though, with lots of famous names and Rogan regulars making appearances. I liked the voices too.The story is about a grocery store. They celebrate the moment when they are picked up by humans and taken outside of the store. However, only a handful of the items know what really happens once they leave the grocery store: they get eaten. And so the story goes on about these grocery store items, hot dogs and buns specifically, trying to discover the truth and make their ways through the grocery store.It got a lot of attention when it came out. It fell shot for me though. There was just too much boredom in between. The ending was great/gross/funny. The beginning was pretty good.Worth a watch6 stars",6.0,Anonymous,Animation

The only thing I find offensive is how unfunny and dull I found this movie to be. I will concede that maybe this movie was never for me.

Despite being an animated film, this is so very glaringly obviously NOT for kids. Parents, stick to Pixar and keep your kids away from this one. The schtick here is that it's an ""adult"" animated film. While that's been done many times before, this film goes out of it's way, sometimes so desperately, to show you how ""not for kids"" it really is; in short: it tries too hard and because of that the dialogue feels forced and awkward at times. While it attempts to touch on real world issues like the Palestinian/Israeli conflict, religion and belief in the after-life, conservative vs liberal beliefs on sex, etc. It doesn't really work and all of that is just seems like the writers siting around going ""haha, what if we did THIS? Wouldn't that be so cool, you guys?"" in between puffs of ganja. There are some scenes that are genuinely funny but they're far and few in between an hour and a half of dumb unfunny prepubescent jokes fired off in rapid succession for shock value and again to reinforce the idea that the viewer is watching something controversial and adult despite it's colorful cartoony polish. After 45 minutes of this mess, you'll be praying for it to quickly come to an end and when it finally does, it's dumb and uneventful. There's no great climax here. It just sorta ends.

"Refreshing,","I enjoyed this movie, it doesn't purports to be something it's not, a very direct ""straight to your face"" movie which is not afraid to slay certain cultures and criticize them at the same time, as an a Jew and an Israeli I find Seth Rogan's humor towards Jews very funny, loved when the so called ""Nazi"" Mayonnaise sang about killing the ""juice"" (Jews) for example and I can testify that the entire crowd in the movie theatre shared the same reply of laughter after this joke.I loved the way they reprimanded about the Israeli- Palestinian issue, the Israeli is represented by a begal and the Palestinian is represented by a láfa (taboon food), the Israeli was described as a vulnerable pacifist while the Arab was described as an aggressive and arrogant food.The Mexican tacos and tequilas were expressing their willing to start a new life in another aisle. But most of the criticism were obviously pointed to the American culture of nowadays where the sausage and the bun just can't wait to finally have an intercourse, the bun is very judgmental of her shape and body and always wonder if she is not as pure as she was when she was in the packing.In summary, I love racial and cultural jokes and that's what I was laughing about in the vast majority of the movie and I can't say that one of the last scenes where the foods, alcoholic beverages and the hygiene products had sexual intercourse didn't leave me traumatized, it took my innocence away.I enjoyed the movie as it gives you a decent break from reality and life and just let focus on the struggle of the living supermarket products to exist.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

But if you're going to take shots at something at least do it in a clever manner. Making obvious stereotypes of Christian, Jewish and Islamic dogma isn't witty or sharp; it's just making obvious and shallow stereotypes. Same goes for the portrayal of homosexuality in the film, which could have worked if the gay men weren't portrayed as lispy and effeminate while the lesbian was portrayed as sex obsessed with a one track mind.At the end of the movie, I was just trying to figure out what the point was. If the whole idea was just to get to an overly long to the point where it gets uncomfortable ""food orgy"" then the movie didn't have to take as long as it did to get there.There's no ""heart"", lessons or humor to be found here.

"So hilarious, So so funny, great, great comedy!!","Not the strangest animated movie I've ever seen as far as the animation is concern. It's very straight forward. What Seth Rogen does with this film is take the traditional archetypes of cartoons and animation and puts a hard R spin on it, with some of the most out there jokes you could only get away with by animating food. No sexual undertones, everything was pretty out in the open.Truly from the makers of This Is the End as it stars most of the cast of that movie (minus Jay Baruchel) and adding such voice talent as Ed Norton, Salma Hayek, and Kristen Wiig.Seth Rogen plays the voice of Frank, part of a pack of sausages, Frank's world is no bigger than the isle he lives in. He spends his life waiting for the moment when the gods will select him to travel to the great beyond so that he can finally ""enter"" Brenda, a hot dog bun that happens to be his girlfriend. however, Frank discovers that the great beyond is not the paradise that was described.It's a bit disturbing. I'm use to Disney's anthropomorphic ducks, and got use to talking cars in Pixar's Cars, and even though I was raised on Duck Tales, It has not stop me from eating duck. This is different. This movie is basically telling me that bread and vegetables are alive, which means I can't eat anything. It's weirdly hilarious watching a a half eaten cookie cry because someone took a bite out of it.Like a typical cartoon, Sausage party has a hidden agenda, with all the foods being separated in isles that represent the culture that they belong to, the different food has to work together and get past those differences in order finish their quest to discover what the great beyond is all about, which is the second agenda as the movie does point out the oddities of religion in a cleaver way.It's so funny, there is far too much to point out cause it all made me laugh so hard (Although, Nick Knoll plays the voice of a Douche, and it was gut busting).Not since This Is the End have I laugh so hard at a Seth Rogen movie, It's definitely worth seeing.http://cinemagardens.com",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

What a dumb mess!,"I mean, it is such an inappropriate movie that kids would never wanna go see on my watch! It wasted the talents of Seth Rogen, Kristen Wiig, Michael Cera, James Franco, Jonah Hill, Nick Kroll, Seth MacFarlane, Paul Rudd, and even Bill Flipping Hader! The animation is uncanny, I think, and the story is very weak. The concept is so idiotic, considering it was an animated movie that kids cannot watch that is meant for adults! The characters are annoying, hateable, and horrible! The setups are so messy and mediocre for its concepts and scenes, and the language and adult s*x are so inappropriate. For starters, I would rather watch Phineas and Ferb, SpongeBob, and VeggieTales (which is way better to look at than this useless, pathetic, annoying pile of junk they call a movie about food)! The world building is very stupid! Again, this is one of the WORST movies to ever be released in such a strong year for animated movies! Again, Frank and Brenda are terrible protagonists, and the voice acting is obviously wasted (as mentioned earlier). Also, the writing is so dumb.

"written by high schoolers, for high schoolers","I searched for several minutes to find my IMDb login for the sole purpose of bashing this movie.While I do like me some adult comedies and certainly have no problem with swearing, gore or the likes, there needs to be some payoff in the form of humor. This is simply not the case here; as others have mentioned, there is NOT A SINGLE joke in this movie. Instead of humor we have a gazillion crude allusions to sex (haha wieners in a bun haha). And this topic doesn't even bother me, I'm sure there are plenty of fine wiener-bun jokes to be had, but this is just done too stupidly!

The Funniest Film of the Year,"Sausage Party is fine work from the usually funny Seth Rogen as he and an extremely talented voice cast work their way through a hilarious script who bring laughs the entire length of the film, cleverly playing on the Pixar Formula that if something other than humans could have emotions or feelings (in this case: food). The jokes hardly ever fail and the writers provide very relevant social commentary which they deliver it in an amusing, fast paced script. Where the film falters however, is in the non-human antagonist who becomes old and worn out after a while. Also, there is an unfunny running gag between Kristen Wigg and her character involving nervous singing which lasts way too long. All in all though, Sausage Party is an exuberant watch with great characters and an ending that takes it way too far perfectly and hysterically (bare in mind, the final scene doesn't feel like it has to be there at all and probably would have worked better as an end credits scene).",4.0,Anonymous,Animation
8/10,"In the supermarket of 'Shopwelles' the food is alive and they all believe that once they are taken by customers, they pass the great doors of the supermarket and they are brought in a paradise for food were humans are their gods. By a left turn of events Frank (Seth Rogen) discovers the truth about food's existence and once he does he takes it onto his own to spread the word to everyone and rebel against the gods.As I have now said probably an unhealthy amount of time, I am the biggest fan of this comedy group there is. I've seen almost every comedy Seth Rogen, Evan Goldberg, Jonah Hill, Judd Apatow and Bill Hader have done and have loved the majority of them, finding great joy and inspiration in their comedy which has never left behind character. With ""Sausage Party"" these people have just added a crowning jewel to their body of work and have made a completely insane film that still manages to stick together and make for a compelling ride.The premise is absolutely fuc*ed up as described by Rogen himself, it is totally crazy, but these guys don't simply stop at that, they build around it a world, characters and dynamics that are even more bat-sh*t crazy. This movie is simply not holding back and that is why as an audience member you do not feel cheated by it. Every gag is rewarding in its own way and whilst some of them might fall a little flat, there are so many thrown at you, you don't even realize the ones that aren't hitting.Be it raunchy, grotesque, outrageous, slapstick, stereotype, sexual, druggie, abusive, dark, satirical, parodist, musical or light-hearted humor, this film hits all of them and it hits them right multiple times, which is ultimately why it is such a success of comedy. Can you think of another film that hits every single one of those notes? I certainly can't and it is definitely a great merit this feature has. All of the comedic brilliance these incredible individuals have managed to muster in all their years is brought to the screen gloriously and it is a joy to experience.What is also something that managed to really surprise me and ultimately keep me pleasantly engaged is to see how this story unfolds. I did not know what to expect and what I got was incredibly intelligent from a filmmaking point of view. There is an incredible variety of characters that you follow and they are all handed to an inter woven narrative that is solidly crafted, but even better is just as insane as the film's content, which really gives the whole product an even bigger comedic value.Of course there are a couple of stumbles along the way: some of the secondary characters aren't really well developed and sometimes the filmmakers push for you to feel something that you aren't actually feeling, some of the chemistry between the characters doesn't really gel together. This also makes some story points fall flat and occasionally pull you out of the film for a couple of minutes.But there's really not much of a point in trying to dissect any negatives of this picture. ""Sausage Party"" is an immensely dense comedy that is as irreverent and funny as I could have hoped for it to be.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

Freedom for all; regardless of nationality and sexual preference,"The movie gives a clear message of how we make our world so challenging to live with taboos that are created by religions. It teaches us, how actually hard it is for us to show our unity and respect everyone with their life decisions. Of course there are many parts in the movie that you can find amusing and just laugh, yet the overall point is to make you realize that most people are scared of an unknown source of power that is going to punish them unless they 'act' in a way that this hidden power commands.It certainly worth to watch it and just ignore these religious people, who give it a low rating on purpose. Actually ignore those people in real life as well, they just don't like the idea of absolute freedom, which we currently need so much.I gave it 8 because the story needs a bit of improvement.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

Funny and Insightful - Pixar for Adults,"Sausage Party is more than just Seth Rogan and friends in animated form making obscene and offensive jokes, Sausage Party brings up many valid questions about our society, religion, and how we view ourselves.In some ways, Sausage Party is exactly what you think it is. A silly animation movie full of raunchy jokes and laughs. If you take this movie for face value, it will still be very goofy and funny. There were times were I could not stop laughing. The pun game is out of control. Some of them will probably go over your head if you are not paying close attention.The thing that put this movie over the top for me though, is that it is almost like a Pixar film for adult themes. The most common and blatant one is God. The movie makes a lot of comparisons to modern religion raising the question, ""Does God exist?"" They even through in a lot of references to how the Bible came about, and how many people believe the Bible has been changed throughout the years.The also bring up many cultural problems with race. The different foods don't always play nice with one another and it makes for some intrigued insight on modern society.Finally, they make a strong point about how women are punished and judged much more harshly in society. The main point is that women should not be judged harsher for being sexual when men are the same way.Ultimately, I think the point of the movie was to not hold back and enjoy life not worrying about consequences that may or may not exist. We can't all just wait for happiness in the great beyond. Nothing is guaranteed in life. You have to live in the present.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

ATHEIST EVANGELISM - Possibly the WORST Propaganda Movie I Have Ever Seen :-(,"This movie was little more than an atheist propaganda piece and was simply abhorrent.It cracks me up when I read reviews of Christian movies like ""God's Not Dead"" and see comments like, ""If I wanted to go to church, I would go to church, not to the movie theatre"", or, ""Preachy to the extreme and mere propaganda"", etc., yet reviews of this piece of cinema garbage known as ""Sausage Party"" are, for the most part, rating it highly.Let me be clear. Sausage Party is not a funny movie. It is not an entertaining movie. It's dull, rather humorless, boring and little more than a badly done propaganda piece of atheism evangelism in cinematic form. It's sort of like an atheist version of some of those rather horrid ""Christian"" films that have poor writing, are of poor quality and do little more than ""preach"".What is really sad is that Sausage Party could have been hilarious, and when I saw the previews, I thought it would be. Had the script stuck to telling an interesting and entertaining story rather than going on an anti-Christ, anti-God, anti-Bible, pro-hedonism idiotic rant, it could have actually been an entertaining and interesting movie.However, the entire point of this movie is to mock religion, blaspheme, offend religious people and try to ""convert"" everyone to being a pro-hedonism atheist.However ... I wouldn't even have as big a problem as I currently have with the movie had the actors and executives simply made it clear that this movie was made to mock religion and convert people to pro-hedonism atheism. In fact, I still would have went to see the movie, or at least rented it, just to see what was being promoted through cinema these days. However, all the previews I saw for this film made it seem like it was simply supposed to be a funny, scary and rather adult cartoon.It would be like Disney running previews of a new version of Snow White and the 7 Dwarfs that show it in a scary light and with an ""R"" rating. Many people would still go see that movie. However, if when they saw the movie they found out that the movie's actual goal was to promote homosexuality and hedonism by showing portraying the dwarfs as homosexuals who engage in wild orgies every night and Snow White as a lesbian who fornicates with witches, you better believe the masses would flip out and leave 1 star reviews until the cows came home.The simple fact is that this movie was dull and boring and that the actors and producers were extremely deceptive with the audience, thanks to the extremely misleading previews of this film.However, I will say one good thing about the movie. The script is so poorly written that while it's obvious the entire point is to ridicule God and religion and to convert people to pro-hedonism atheism, by the time one finishes watching it, it is so abundantly clear that pro-hedonism atheism is not only disgusting and something to be avoided like the plague, it is also idiotic and only a self-worshipping and prideful loon would actually choose to reject their divine Creator in favor of a hedonistic lifestyle and atheism.Of course, anyone who believes that ""everything came from nothing"" is scientific and more plausible than the Biblical account of creation, has abandoned sense, logic and reason long ago, in a quest to live for self and without rules.

"There are sausages, but no party in this offensive bore.","With a deliberately inappropriate name, Sausage Party is about food items from a supermarket wanting to be purchased and taken home...only to find out that we eat them, and so they most warn others of this revelation. This was heavily marketed as inappropriate, offensive and ridiculously funny...heck even critics have rated this highly, so it must be all three right? Wrong. It's definitely inappropriate and offensive, but funny? Hardly. Let me start off with the good points, the voice acting is great with many comedic Hollywood actors being involved (particular praise to Kristen Wiig and Seth Rogen) and it brought bit of life to the characters. The animation was OK, nothing spectacular but it did the job for the most part, it did look bit clumsy and unfinished in certain scenes. Right, now for the negative aspects. Oh my word this film is offensive! It has everything from racial stereotypes, religious backlash, extreme profanity (as extreme as food profanity can get), a ridiculous amount of innuendos and to top it all off, encouraging drug use. Now I might be pushing it with the last part but seriously when a script is so forced to be offensive in every line, it grows tiresome after the first 5 minutes and this is where the problem lies. With an 89 minute runtime the 'jokes' become old fast and with thinly written characters it just means its extremely difficult to care for them and the story as a whole. The last 15 minutes of the film was actually funny and enjoyable (not to mention it has scarred me for life, if you've seen it then you know what I mean) but at that stage I just didn't care for it. The film would've benefited from some clever dialogue...where were the puns? Instead all we got was sex jokes and racial stereotypes from food items, because apparently we all laugh at Salma Hayek voicing a taco because she's Mexican or noodles impersonating Japanese people. I see what they were attempting to do, portraying the supermarket as a smaller scale version of the world and the different cultures, but it was just plain offensive and completely misused. Then there was one scene attempting the whole ""religion is just belief as there is no proof that God exists""...it got under my skin, the screenwriters weren't even trying to hide what they were doing, they might as well have got the food items to say ""science beats religion!"". The last 5 minutes of the film sealed its fate, what was the point!? What would they have gained by revealing what they did? Apart from the potential of a sequel (please...no no, don't even!). Alright...I'm calm, I'm done. Overall, Sausage Party had the potential to be offensive and witty but instead chose to use racial stereotypes, extreme profanity and innuendos in attempt to gain laughs from this borefest. I shan't be watching it again.Review at: http://www.themoviediorama.com",3.0,Anonymous,Animation
Seth Rogen gets animated,"To say the least, I was excited when I heard Seth Rogen was gonna make his first animated movie, about foods as well. This was long ago though and it felt like it would take forever before I saw it, but now I have and all I can say is...It's a very funny movie, and well put together as well. The voice acting is top-notch from everyone in cast. Not just Rogen, but practically all of the voice actors brought something of their own. Of course, Rogen, Kristen Wiig, Jonah Hill and Edward Norton (Yep, he's actually in there) bring their fullest as they usually do, but names I'm less familiar with like Scott Underwood (his acting debut) and Nick Kroll did solid jobs as well. As for the characters, there are so many great ones, most of them have their own quirky personalities and their memorable one-liners. But my favorite has to be Teresa El Taco. I loved how she just kept hitting at Brenda all the time, and was so adorable as well. I rooted for her throughout the movie, and Brenda and Frank's romance didn't really feel that believable anyway.Most of all though, I was either laughing or at least had a smile on my face for the majority of the time. Every scene had near-impeccable comic timing, and all the food puns I wanted were definitely present. Sometimes the silly puns were even funnier than the sex jokes they went with. Every time a new character was introduced, opportunities for new kind of jokes showed up. You gotta love when a poor almost used-up roll of toilet paper speaks with a frail shaky voice about the traumatizing s'hit he's been through. Or the war-esque sequence where every piece of food is dying, like the jelly for the peanut butter (easy joke, but still got to me). And I won't spoil what happened in it, but the talked-about food orgy which occurs at one point... It's a little gross and yes, really, REALLY stupid, but I laughed my ass off nevertheless. It's not *that* graphic however, not the NC-17 material Rogen & co. thought of it as, but still stands as one of the craziest scenes I've witnessed in an animated movie. Jesus.There's a present undertone about religion as well (with the foods thinking they'll go to The Great Beyond, but it's really just a load of crap) which I think they handled well. Yes there are jokes which will bother some people (like most around Lavash, an Islamic stereotype), but I just loved them, not to mention Lavash wasn't such a horrible stereotype. He's been brought up on out-dated values, but isn't depicted as a crazy, deranged lunatic. I didn't mind the movie being atheist in nature either, and everyone believing in The Great Beyond weren't depicted as stupid, just misinformed.If I have any negatives, it's only that despite my praise, my expectations were still too high. I almost expected The Interview levels of funny, but it didn't really reach that bar. Some parts of the movie felt a bit slow (like the fire circle scene) and a lot, but not *all* of the jokes hit like they should've. The ending is not a problem for me though, I freaking loved it. I know it has resulted in mixed opinions, but I didn't see what was the problem with it. You ask me, that's the best possible one they could have used.Sausages, sausages for everyone!

very clever in a not so subtle way,"this is not for everyone. i'm just putting that out there. this movie is for the most part, a not so subtle social commentary on everything ranging from Sex, Sexual Orientation, Race, Religion, God...and much more. for the most part, I thought this movie was funny and well done. some people might find the vulgarity (which there is a lot of) off putting and that's understandable. what I found interesting about this movie is that it embarks on a quest to give us the very answers we seek in our daily lives. Frank (the main sausage protagonist) embarks on a quest to find the truth about the gods (us) and what lies beyond. when he discovers the horrifying truth, he attempts to inform his brethren of the reality of the world only to be mocked insulted and generally dismissed. it takes his friend Carl (another sausage who figured out the horrible truth), who makes him realize that its not about the message but how its delivered. if you insult peoples beliefs,how then, can you expect to get people to see the truth? the movie also utilizes a variety of racial and sexual stereotypes to prove its point and I found the utilization to be very effective in order to promote the message the movie was trying to promote. all in all I really enjoyed the movie, but I realize, that where the movie fails, was in going against what the movie was all about. discovering the truth and finding a respectful way to spread that truth. a lot of people will find this very disrespectful and very vulgar. in that since it failed, because the message will be lost within the whirlwind of foul language, sexual innuendo and racial stereotypes. then there is the ending...you will never see tacos, hotdog's, flatbread's and bagels the same way again. all in all I really enjoyed the movie and i'm glad it was a financial success, because I want to see the sequel.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Sounds Exaggerated, But Maybe The Worst Movie I've Ever Seen","When I saw ""Knocked Up"" in 2007, I became a fan of ""Seth Rogan humor"", as I consider that film to be hilarious. Ever since then, I've usually had an ear or eye open when one of his projects comes down the pike. It was that thought process that got me into the theater for ""Sausage Party""...and experience that I sincerely wish I could take back. While perhaps not the worst movie I've EVER seen (but...maybe), it is easily the worst I've ever reviewed here on Amazon.For a basic plot summary, ""Sausage Party"" begins like ""Toy Story in the grocery store"", with all the different foods wanting to be ""chosen"" by beings (humans) they believe to be Gods. Frank the hot dog (Rogan) and Brenda the bun (Kristen Wiig) want to be chosen together (for obvious reasons) and that seems to be exactly what happens...until the plan goes awry and they become separated, having to decipher the mystery of ""the great beyond"" for themselves.I could spend oh so much time painstakingly going over why ""Sausage Party"" is truly an abomination, but I'll boil it down here to three main areas:1. It's wildly offensive, both in language and tone. I'm not terribly sensitive to the f-bomb being dropped in movies, but when it happens every couple words it is clearly just lazy dialogue. The whole ""we don't have anything really interesting to say, so let's just curse a lot"" sort of mentality. It is also one of the raunchiest films (in terms of content) that I have ever seen. Again, I'm no prude, but every single joke is of the most crass or sexual nature possible. 2. The whole thing wants to work as a critique of organized religion, but it falls flat (again, I think, because the crudity and profanity overshadow everything else). 3. The plot is completely and utterly pointless. It is mainly just these animated characters wandering around and finding themselves in bizarre and gross situations.Put it this way...as a person who thoroughly enjoys quality cinema, I am able to find not an ounce of redeeming value in this movie. Call me a snob if you will, but I enjoy shows like ""Family Guy"" and other low-brow pursuits. ""Sausage Party"", however, is what happens when you let Seth Rogan take ""stoner humor"" to its maximum (and then beyond).With the possible exception of ""Dumb and Dumber 2"", this is undoubtedly the worst movie I've seen in the past 2-3 years. Maybe I've seen worse in my lifetime...but maybe I haven't, either.",1.0,Anonymous,Animation

I did not laugh at any of this film either. I know that it can be amusing that scene about the dope head scene. But really! I can watch Toy Story over and over( which is better and more sense).................",1.0,Anonymous,Animation
If I could give it less than 1 star I would.,"For the first few minutes I found the sexual referencing and swearing in song pretty hilarious, but as the movie went on it was just going too far. The swearing was far too excessive, there was a lot of drug use (which says something about the guy who wrote this movie), and there was also a fair amount of offensive stereotyping too. It got beyond amusing and was just plain offensive with half the script being nothing but profanities. When I eventually got to watching it through I was not at all entertained but was angry with myself for letting myself watch it through. It went from being plain offensive to absolutely vulgar just for the sake of pushing how far they could go with this movie. Very distasteful and pure garbage. There were very few moments where I found the movie funny but this paled to the amount of frustration and disgust I felt in watching the majority of it. You don't have to be sickening to be an adult movie.",1.0,Anonymous,Animation

Deviant Pixar,"When I saw the trailer for this movie, I thought, this looks so twisted I'm not sure if I want to watch it. But by the end, I thought, this looks so twisted I'm going to have to watch it.The movie is styled after typical animated kid's movies like Toy Story, with anthropomorphized foodstuffs in a grocery store chatting and singing. Their song describes the joy of the moment when the ""gods"" will take them to the ""great beyond,"" and the movie is mainly concerned with the horrific truth that the great beyond is where food goes to be sliced, boiled, and eaten.Deaths are both clever and horrific, as when a jar of jelly lies on the floor, its life-jelly oozing out, while a jar of peanut butter weeps. I mean, the people who made this movie are really sick.There's also a lot of jokes about sex. It's possible that sex jokes make up 50% of this film.Surprisingly, even though the movie is full of sick humor and cheap sex jokes, this is a surprisingly smart movie. The story is well designed, the characters are relatable, and the movie has interesting takes on religious belief and approaches Mid-East tensions . It's well animated and voiced and often really, really funny. This really is the movie Pixar would make if they decided to make a really tasteless movie about sex between hot dogs and buns. Seriously.I would expect a lot of people to hate this movie. It's basically a movie of foul-mouthed food telling sex jokes and dying horribly. But for a certain sort of twisted individual, this movie is a blast.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Wildly unfunny,"I'm a huge fan of both Seth Rogen and Jonah Hill. The pair have delivered some of my favorite movies over the last decade. The thought of an R rated comedy also appealed to me. I'm a big fan of 'Family Guy', 'American Dad', 'South Park' etc. and would happily watch a feature length film of them with an R rating (the 'South Park' feature film is one of my favourites of all time). So all the signs were positive going into 'Sausage Party'. Then the movie started and it got off to quite a clunky, awkward and stunted beginning. That's okay though I thought, they'll ease into things as it goes along and the jokes will start to flow. I waited, and waited, and waited some more. At about the halfway point I realised I hadn't laughed once, didn't care in the slightest about the story, and was frankly bored out of my mind. What was this nonsense? What part of this exactly was I supposed to be finding funny?Did they think that the concept alone, of food being alive, could carry an entire 90 minutes of film, and that consequently they didn't have to write any real jokes? That's how it came across. I read that Seth Rogen had a hard time getting this picked up by film studios because of its dark nature. I now suspect they were just being polite in saying that was the reason, and truthfully they just knew that it was an incredibly weak script. To say I was disappointed would be an understatement. It won't put me off anyone involved, but I do hope they steer clear of the animated genre from now on. Stick to what you do best. You're brilliant at that.",3.0,Anonymous,Animation
Awful. Excellent. A disaster and a masterpiece,"This movie is definitely not for everyone. It is crass, irreverent, full of crude sexual innuendos, racial stereotypes, drugs, sex and violence. If none of this bothers you it's great lol. It's essentially a movie about a bunch of food in a grocery store that doesn't know when it gets bought it's going to be eaten. Once they find out all chaos ensues. And one of the very last scenes is.... A lot.... To say the least. Like I said it's not for everyone but I found it hilarious. It even has a few of the stereotypes who hated each other in the beginning end up ""friends"" in the end. It's not a wholesome moment or anything, but still lol.

"A good idea, but doesn't have enough to go the whole length","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningIn a big American supermarket, some foodstuffs including a talking sausage, secretly come to life when no one can see them, and dream of being chosen and taken to the 'great beyond.' It seems like their time has come, but then they all get separated by accident, and learn of the true fate that awaits them when they're taken away.Seth Rogen spreads his brand of adult humour further with Sausage Party, expanding in to animated territory and turning the Disney/Pixar trend on its head with something apparently innocent looking that seriously isn't for kids. Its a subversive idea, that runs on the premise of being an animated film with loads of swearing and sexually explicit references, but it's a one joke premise that wears thin pretty quickly and doesn't really have the durability to sustain a feature length production, and would probably have worked better as a sketch.The whole film sees food products re-imagined in humanistic form, which makes for some subtle references to real life people, and dutifully leaves political correctness to the side lines. And so we have the Israeli/Palestinian conflict re-imagined as a bickering bagel and taco, a permanently drunk bottle of Mexican tequila, as well as a whole parading army of Nazi sauerkraut (that want to exterminate 'the juice.'). It certainly pushes the boundaries, but has no great plot to guide in, and so ends up being just a pile of occasionally funny set pieces, rounding off with a big, massive 'food orgy', for want of anything more fitting.Toy Story for adults, then. If only there was a bit of a 'Story', and one that had something more to it and helped keep you interested during the admittedly small length. **",4.0,Anonymous,Animation

Don't listen anybody......just enjoy the fun,"First of all, I want to say if you are a fun lover and animation movie fan then this is a fair choice for you. This is a movie with a good story, enough adult jokes, and a very good political message. It is a good combination of comedy and serious double meaning message. If you are confused about the theme then please don't listen anybody....just enjoy the fun.This is a story about some sausage snacks who lived in a supermarket and they just want to expand their experience and they wanted one of any customer choose them and bring them home. A hot dog sausage named Frank with his friends, want to warn his friends of their terrifying future, and in the process, wages war with the human race. The story is charming and the script is full of energy to give you the right humor. If the question is the story, I think this is good.Performance-wise Jonah Hill has done a very good job and Seth Rogen also has done a fair job with their voice. Rest of the cast is good. The storytelling style is nothing new. Sometimes I felt it is not new and Movie Like ""cars"" already use this strategy. So the style is predictable. First, 30 minutes the movie has horrible pace and the story is not gradually built but after all, pace is not bad. Animation quality is very good and the plot also holds some good point. The director duo Greg Tiernan and Conrad Vernon were trying to give you the fun and I think they are successful.

A Pedophiles Dream,"Unfortunately if you watch the YouTube clip with Rogan commenting on the last sex scene Rogan says it's vile. That applies to the whole movie. The unfortunate part is that he's actually admiring his own work. What does that say about him? It's a known fact that pedophiles show badly made cartoon character porno films to children to entice them into sexual relations. A copy of this highly polished professionally made cartoon porno film is a pedophiles dream. Putting it in the hands of those people is criminal. If you know someone who you think is a little suspect and you know has bought this film do not allow your children alone in their home. The cartoon promotes IV drug use as mind expanding, depicts anal assault, oral sex, multiple partners, suicide and much, much more. I know it's an adult rated film but the fear is that impressionable children will find a way to watch it if it's accessible. Believe me your children will hear about it from school friends who's parents don't care about their children and there's plenty of those. Please, if you buy this film please lock it up like you do your guns. As a society we admonish and stop retailers who use the cartoon format to target youth for cigarettes, alcohol and other damaging products. But our modern Hollywood ""censors"" allow this trash to be made and distributed. It's no wonder other nations see the U.S. as morally bankrupt. Yes I saw it.

Unfunny Juvenile Garbage.,"I think they tried to make an r rated version of toy story with some clever satire commentary about diet, lifestyle, religious fanaticism, and sexual purity.I can assure you they have failed miserably, this movie is bad, unfunny, repetitive, preachy and stretched out.This could have been a great movie, but there are several factors that made it into the garbage that it is.Trying to shove politics into this movie was the biggest mistake.Putting in Christian morals was the second.The whole mechanism of the sentient food articles was not very well grounded either.

Adult satire of Toy Story,"I'm not sure how I'm going to write a review for this. It seems natural just to describe its main points and personal opinion on those points but that's more an extension of the movie summary, isn't it? So I'll try to review it in film terms.Well the plot is quite simple and the humour is basic distaste sort of humour. The message is very clearly anti-religious and yet the alternatives presented are either negative or questionable. I'd go so far as to say it is aimed at viewers of the anti-religion, anti- morality persuasion... If you are not such a viewer you may struggle to enjoy the movie, unless you are the thinking kind, in which case you may well find it challenging.The idea of food being alive (unlike toys) is actually incredibly disturbing from an eating point of view and could put you off eating ever again if you are 5 and watching this. It is a 15 in Britain so that's unlikely, and R-rated elsewhere. For some of the end content I'd only recommend it to adults really.I'm still not sure what to say. It was OK but a lot of the stereotypes were typical. I don't want to spoil a lot either but it has its trippy moments. The horror movie factor seen in the trailer was quite minimal and more sexually explicit part was brisk, probably all for rating/release issues.

"I like the idea, but this needs a much better script","With this kind of merrily vulgar humor, I guess it's kind of a feat that ""Sausage Party"" was greenlit in the first place. Honestly, this had me at Disney parody, but its targets are much more varied: organized religion, racial division, consumerism. And its cheap animation is at odds with the voice talent (seriously, look at that cast). I think that cheapness contributes nicely to the middle finger that is this movie.On the other hand, as an actual comedy, this is the worst I've seen in a long time; chock-full of facepalm gags and insufferable dialogue.

Fun Food,"This is my review of Sausage Party (spoiler free)**** (4/5)Cast: Seth Rogen, Kristen Wiig, Michael Cera, Jonah Hill, Jay Baruchel, Bill Hader, Edward Norton, Salma Hayek, James Franco, Paul Rudd.Plot: Shopwell's supermarket is full of happy groceries, waiting to go to the 'Great Beyond'. But one day they discover evidence to suggest there is a much darker future in store for them.In the original Shrek, the Gingerbread Man is tortured by the malevolent Lord Farquaad. Dunked in milk with his legs ripped off, he's threatened with even worse bodily harm. ""No, not my buttons!"" he squeals. ""Not my gumdrop buttons!"" It's apt that Conrad Vernon, the man who both created and voiced 'Gingy', is also one of the directors of Sausage Party. Because, like the scene described above which is arguably the most violent that movie can get apart from the beer fight. This unlikeliest of summer-season animations is a weird hybrid of cutesy cartoon and horror flick, a tale in which awful things happen to sentient food products. It may be a weird hybrid between the two but it's both very very rude but very very funny in its use of random rudeness but that particular influx of randomness pulls through in what could be the greatest animation ever. It's arguably an intended spoof for the creators of Superbad Evan Goldberg and Seth Rogen to make a mockery of all the animations that they love/loved as either children or adults. Our hero Frank (Rogen) who has unimaginable feelings for his bun-friend Brenda (Wiig, on top form once again, and also more confident than ever) and he shares his packaging with Barry (Cera, in his bravest role ever), and Carl (Hill, in possibly his shortest role ever as he doesn't last very long) see that life in the supermarket isn't quite what it seems, as Frank goes off in search for the truth. There is one point in this cutesy animation that makes it a creepy horror flick, because this also uses violence not the slapstick you normally get in films like this but guts out violence, in what could be described as the most violent scene in any animation ever. Beyond all the Pixar-like feelings this film will give it is nowhere near child friendly but with its charm and vulgarity it shows that adults can love animation too.What if the premise of a film like Toy Story, in which inanimate objects come to terms with the meaning of their existence, was pushed to its logical dark-as-hell conclusion? There is an increasing amount of glee in Sausage Party (a tale about pork that is more sex-obsessed than Porky's) as it heads towards its demented denouement. Brought to life by sub-Pixar but decent CGI, as it bustles with anthropomorphic edibles. There is a tomato voiced by Rudd, a sultry taco with the tones of Salma Hayek and even a Hitler-esque sauerkraut shouting ""exterminate the juice."" In case how man food based puns there are; the answer is a lot. At first though it seems that, that is all this seems to offer, with enough raunch to make a beetroot blush. Gradually, though, this reveals itself to be a bold piece of work with some rather big ideas. The return of a panicked jar of honey mustard (Danny McBride) to the store, raving about the abuse meted out to food items by humans, triggers an existential quest for Frank to go on and he goes to extreme lengths (pun intended) to search for the truth. There is a concept of organized religion that is explored, as the lone sausage tries to convince his blissed-out companions they not be headed for a glorious after life, but rather a knife-assisted oblivion. Even the Israel/Palestine conflict is riffed upon, through the unlikely medium of a relationship between a lavish (David Krumholtz) and a bagel (Edward Norton, doing a big, goofy impression of Woody Allen and just about stealing the show).There are smarts to Sausage Party that are well-concealed between layers of utter filth, which ramps up and up until a late set-piece that will likely make you choke with laughter: think Caligula re-enacted by condiments. Bringing to mind a go-for-broke vibe of South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut, the final reel unleashes debauchery and mayhem of a kind that makes you wonder if a studio exec ever checked in on the production. There are some barren bits – there is a villain that is an actual douche (Nick Kroll) who's more loud than funny, and some of the gags have the feeling that the writers got them from a box of Christmas crackers – but Rogen and Goldberg have succeeded in cooking up something truly original. Also in its incredibly short run time it delivers laughs out the whazoo, rudeness and food related violence and sex. The finale, meanwhile, suggests yet another Meta sequel could be on its way. It leaves us to believe what these sausages could get up to next. You may even forgive it for being incredibly short. It's nice to see Seth Rogen on top form once again.Verdict: It sounded like the dumbest movie of all time, but it's actually smart, subversive and packed with famous voice, saying wonderfully unspeakable things. In fact, it's a banger.8/10 balls out entertainment.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Raunchy adolescent humor?,"After seeing previews of this film, my 12 year old daughter said she wanted to see it because it looked funny. So as with all films I previewed it before permission was given. I was simply amazed at the number of F' words used in this film among many other disturbing things. This brings up an issue of advertising. I really believe there should be a specific and separate warning for ""cartoon"" films that say ""not suitable for children"", kinda like Camel Joe for the tobacco industry. The R rating just isn't enough. No one pays attention to those anymore because there is not always a definition to the warning. So which is more harmful, violence, nudity, drug use or perverted behavior, etc. I believe my daughter would have been traumatized by watching and ""listening"" to this movie. Fortunately my daughter is very good about accepting my guidance as to what is appropriate and would not watch this without my permission. But I worry about other kids that might be drawn to and get access to this film, and you can't always dump it off on the individual parent. It takes a village. This type of film has no business being advertised like any other animated cartoon movie. Its a crappy movie and the humor is only funny if your a deviant.

We got three plots revolving around Frank, the main character figuring out the truth of his religion, the deformed sausage who I can't remember the name of is to warn everyone about the humans, and than the douche who really has no effect on the movie though he is the most interesting character. Overall bland characters and terrible pacing.The jokes in Sausage Party is just garbage. Like I said before the jokes are childish dick jokes, swearing, stereotypes and sex which is NOT original. Whenever I'm not facepalming at the edginess the stereotypes are just so boring. I chuckled maybe twice this whole movie but thats it.Overall this movie was terrible with few redeemable parts.

"Layered, onion style","Many people see this movie as ""extremely and excessively vulgar"", and I can see their point of view. I agree, it has all kinds of ""toilet humor"" (even literally), but when you scrape off some surface layers, it has a strong message.The story is about food that is convinced there's a new life beyond the store's door. The movie itself is the satire of the current society we live in, mostly alluding on religious and racial prejudice. The main protagonist, Frank (this is obviously a ""Jesus character"", since both of them hide ""truth"" behind their name) discovers that ""god's"" are not the way they're presented. Although the fruit believes there's ""fruit heaven"" behind the door, and they talk about it religiously, they soon find out that they've been lied to all the time. Frank comes with the proof of it (although all other supermarket products are skeptical at first), they unite despite their differences, conquer ""god's"" (humans) and at the end have an orgy of a life-time.Since they're basically obsessed with copulation, just like humans are obsessed with ""better life after death"", they prove that, if united, they can have their ""heaven"" before they go through ""great beyond"". I see this as a strong message to people to stop hoping for unknown tomorrow and enjoy life right now.Humor itself, word play, wise nice.F**k the Juice!",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Get it? They're cartoons but they say the sex,"When I reviewed The Little Prince, I named some things that don't automatically make you or anything else ""adult"". For instance, you don't need to let go of the whimsy of imagination and you don't need to conform to a system that dictates the entirety of your existence. When it comes to movies, meanwhile, there's a lot more to being adult than dropping F bombs and referencing the human mating ritual. This is where Sausage Party, which brags about being the rarity that is an R-rated animated movie, comes in.The thing with the R-rating is that you can always tell when the rating is a byproduct of the film that got made, versus when the film that got made set out to be rated R. Much like Deadpool, which was a purposeful attempt at an R-rated superhero movie, Sausage Party has just the right amount of forced sex jokes and crude language you'd except from a purposeful attempt at an R-rated animation. Does that make it dreadful? Not necessarily. But it does make it obvious.Speaking of obvious, every character in the film is some sort of grocery store item and their gender seems to be determined by which ones are phallic and which ones look vaginal. The voice cast, as usual, is all stars and no voice actors but some of them do an ample job. Seth Rogen leads the film as a sausage who is brought from the supermarket to ""The Great Beyond"" (the average human home), and his co-stars include Johan Hill as yet another sausage, Kristen Wiig as a hot dog bun (get it?), Michael Cera, Craig Robinson, Paul Rudd (as one of the few human characters), Edward Norton, James Franco, Salma Hayek (as a taco shell that's also a lesbian), Bill Hader in a dual role, Danny McBride, and Nick Kroll.The plot, naturally, is that all the items come to the realization that The Great Beyond isn't all that great and that a fate of getting eaten, or worse, awaits them. There are some laughs and sparse moments of cleverness throughout the movie but nothing about it wowed me the way it has evidently wowed movie-goers. I got a good chortle out of watching these guys gaze in horror as their friends got turned into dinner, though not only did the shtick seem familiar to me, but it also would have worked better as a short sketch on YouTube. Even the mind-screw ending reminded me of certain parts from The Lego Movie.The film was directed by Greg Tiernan with a little help from Dreamworks' own Conrad Vernon. The writing was done by the likes of Rogen himself and his good friend Evan Goldberg, which goes without saying if you've seen any of their other films prior to this one. They've had some legitimately great and smart films, but you can always tell that they love to throw in their t-ttyf-ck jokes and drug humor when they concur that it's getting a little slow. When you get used to the formula, you kinda stop being impressed.Certain jokes are Foodfight-level food product puns except dirtier (somehow). There's also the occasional ""douche"" pun in the form of a character who is a douche both literally and figuratively. If you don't get it, in spite of the fact that even the most toddling of toddlers would, then don't worry - the joke goes on for a while. There is also music, and whenever it's not ""whatever the kids are listening to on the Spotifies these days"", it's a score by Alan Menken. Your guess is as good as mine, dear reader.Although the animation isn't technically anything remarkable, it's worth mentioning that almost half of the animators weren't paid for their work. As I'm writing this, they're even looking to take one of the production companies, Nitrogen Studios Canada, to court for wage theft. When a movie gets made under such inexcusable circumstances, it's hard for me to be appreciative of it. And independent of this unhappy behind-the-scenes fact, the film still ain't especially great. I'm rating it 2.5/5 douches.At least Rogen and Goldberg and the rest of the crew can rest easy knowing they made the world's first animated feature film that isn't meant for kids. Except for Heavy Metal, the South Park movie, Waltz with Bashir, Anomalisa, Mary & Max, Down and Dirty Duck, Fritz the Cat, Beavis & Butthead Do America, Felidae, and The Killing Joke, which came out just a few weeks before Sausage Party even. But other than that, though...",4.0,Anonymous,Animation

The market for these 'films' are Millennials (Gen Wussers) who live in their parents basements,don't have drivers licenses, don't own cars or houses, run around playing Pokeman (?) on their cell phones like 6-year olds, want a Nanny Government to provide everything for them from cradle to grave without working, and generally have forsaken adulthood for permanent adolescence.

I feel less intelligent after watching this,"This movie was just the worst.The target audience is definitely 14 year old ""edge lords"". I shudder to think of anyone who actually appreciates the so called comedy in this film. There are very few actual jokes, and mostly just inappropriate and crass lines of dialogue that feel very, very forced.The movie relies on the exploitation of racial, religious, cultural and sexual stereotypes that are harmful to their respective communities. There are ways to satirise and poke fun of certain groups that can be done in an amusing and intelligent way... this is not one of them.The reference to drug use just seems painfully shoved in, and unnecessary. In fact, this whole film is unnecessary. I was waiting for something remotely funny or amusing to happen and I sat through an hour and a half of pure profanity and mindless sludge until the credits started rolling.Visually I guess the film is impressive- but the character models seem odd and unnatural. I can't fault the animators for this though, given they have to make literal cans of soup into characters. This film should have been stopped as a bad idea on paper long before it proceeded to also be badly executed.In conclusion, I hate myself now. This movie has made me hate myself. I can often laugh at Seth Rogen's comedies; Superbad is a very good film, This Is The End had it's moments and even The Interview had one or two moments that made me smile. This film offers nothing. It tries way too hard to be edgy, and comes across as pathetic for trying so hard. A hard pass.",1.0,Anonymous,Animation
That was something different,"I just saw a clip of this movie and decided to watch the full movie. It was a different experience watching an adult animated movie. It was quite enjoyable. The movie entertains you from the start till the end. The story was so different and nicely executed, the direction was good, the animation was also good and the voice performances were also good.

Sausage Party (2016),"It may not be as funny as some, I included, may have hoped- but what Sausage Party lacks in comedy, is made up in worldbuilding and cleverness- and a surprisingly deep moral message deep down inside. I did expect a bit more of this flick to be honest, expecting it was a foulmouthed comedy in the glorious form of CGI animation. Granted, there are many many scenes in this film that are absolutely outrageous, but it feels forced at times, and to have no point than to just show how far they are willing to go to reach the point of uncomfort. I chuckled a few times throughout this film, but never did I laugh like I expected to, and I found that to be the most disappointing flaw the film had to offer. Besides that, I did end up enjoying this raunchy little flick. It's animation is nothing special, but it's interesting and entertaining to see the world of food be brought out to us like this, and I found the world that they built in the process to be very well thought out, which I did not expect in the slightest. Its start is a bit predictable, but once you get into the plot of the film, you can't help but feel it is anything but basic. The voice actors are talented as always, namely Seth Rogen, Bill Hader, Nick Kroll, Michael Cera, and Ed Norton- to name a few. I also enjoyed Salma Hayek as a horny taco, although I did feel her character, as well as parts of the film in general, were a bit needlessly oversexualized. In the end, Sausage Party was not what I expected but a decent watch nevertheless. What it lacks in laughs, it makes up for in cleverness, and though that may not be enough for some, it was plenty filling for me.

Finally some 3D animated dirtiness,"Even as a Pixar and Disney enthusiast, I got enough of a kick out of this film and it is true enough that just because something may be animated don't mean that it's for any age. I mostly feel a 3 1/2, but the extra 1/2 is for that rare and crazy idea for Rogen, Hill, Cera and the others to come up with another raunchy film, yet animated style. While it may have gone a bit further than I thought with the R-rated content, it was overall enough of what I expected. As unexpected, it had an interesting and well unpredictable storyline. The movie itself featured many hysterical gags that you would most likely hear from an adult world with adult talking foods. It also may have been a bit too witty and sometimes a little too carried away, but this kind of idea for a comedy I thought was as clever as it was raunchy, even well before the film was released.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Crass, Crude, Vulgar, Nasty, Funny","Before watching Sausage Party, I read a few articles about the movie, as I do before I watch virtually any new movie. What struck me most was my finding that the movie originally earned an NC-17 rating. I wondered how a movie about cartoon food could possibly accomplish that.As it turned out, I only needed to watch the opening few minutes before I understood. After the remaining 90 minutes passed, I wondered how the movie in its current form managed to escape with a mere R rating. I saw an abundance of reasons no one under 17 should watch the movie, including the avalanche of explicit sexual descriptions, graphic drug use (apparently food can use drugs, who knew?), and sins against humanity committed by a douche. And that's not all. Not even close.From beginning to end, Sausage party will disgust you. It will appall you. It will make you never look at tacos the same way again.The entire movie is a gigantic f*** fest. By that I mean verbal f-bombs are dropped left and right, and (minor spoiler alert, but who I am kidding—you should know what's coming) all the foods literally take part in a gigantic f*** fest.The filmmakers save this for the end, of course. In the final scene, the store's foods erupt into an all-inclusive, heterosexual, homosexual, bisexual, interracial (at least, as much as cartoon foods can have races) and wildly creative orgy that would make a progressive citizen of 2016 proud. Or just really grossed out.As repulsive as that may sound, the movie isn't all bad. Somewhere along the way as you view all that lewd, pornographic material (at least as much as cartoon foods can be pornographic, which as it turns out, they can be jarringly pornographic), you will laugh. Maybe it will only be a confused, disbelieving, uncomfortable laugh. But you will laugh.Even after reading this, the depths of unhinged sexuality in this movie will still surprise you. I laid out in no uncertain terms, what you should expect, and the sexual content will still surprise you. And that's not the only surprising aspect of this movie, which is a cartoon. Did I mention that? Even if I did, it bears repeating.The other startling aspect of the movie is the volume of racial stereotypes unleashed through the portrayals of food. At first, this struck me terribly distasteful and unfunny. Soon I realized that these stereotypes were so grossly exaggerated that they actually functioned as a sort of self-aware jab at racial jokes made in typical R-rated comedies.In fact, I'm just now realizing that the entire movie is essentially an ironic depiction of the typical R-rated comedy. They turned the sexuality up to 11 to poke fun at the other movies that fall back on obvious sex jokes to create laughs.On many members of the audience, this intention may have been lost. It likely only became evident to some of the most discerning movie-goers as they watched (it may also have dawned on some of the less discerning viewers days later as they wrote about the movie).So there you have it. I didn't bother addressing any specifics of the movie, such as, character names or plot lines. If you want that stuff, fine. One hotdog is named Frank and the foods freak out when they learn that humans eat food. Not quite as complicated as Inception.Anyway, if you're looking for a crass comedy to supply a few laughs, this could be the movie for you. If you desire something self-aware that takes a subtle jab at the average raunchy comedy, this movie could also be for you. (It's odd to realize that there's a subtlety to this movie, considering that most of the sexual jokes contain absolutely zero subtlety. It's a neat trick).Whatever your preference, just don't see Sausage Party with your parents. Even if you're thirty and have kids of your own, don't see it with your parents. I bet it would still be weird.",4.0,Anonymous,Animation

"Hilarious, confrontational and very cleverly made","Oh my, I thought the trailer was brilliant, but I never thought this movie would be this crazy. It was funny, very clever and brutally honest on some world- and society problems like different religions refusing to co-exist, like the Arab Lavash and the Jewish Bagel.Many taboos and a lot of bigotry and sexism passes by and some people walked out of the movie (yes, that started after the street-scene) but 90% of the audience were in a hilarious OMG mode: 'No, they didn't!' A stranger next to me just couldn't stop laughing and was crying his eyes out - so was I. Especially near the end there is a scene (no spoilers) where I found myself in shock with awe and I just couldn't believe my eyes. And I am not easily shocked, I can tell you. The animators most have had the time of their lives, creating that scene in particular!Apart from this hilarious experience I happily got to share with the rest of the viewers, the story was good, steady and filled with jokes. The voice-acting was brilliant, (what a cast!) and the animations were well done. Okay, three points of criticism: the evil Douche is not really adding to the story or necessary for the actions of the main characters. The biggest antagonists are the humans already. He does have a few good jokes. The second is some irregularities because e.g. in the street scene - without spoiling - that is not food talking, so that is simply not correct. Deadly funny though. Same counts for Douche or toiletpaper.And the biggest reaction of the audience. The last thing is the ending. But how can you end a movie that has that huge 'ensemble- scene' at the end. If you'd end it there, that would leave the fate of the characters unanswered. How they make it end now feels a bit too fabricated. But okay, after this hysterical roller-coaster ride, it doesn't really matter anymore.If you are easily offended and are a big fan of little house on the prairie, don't watch it. If you like a cleverly written, acted and animated adult animated movie which is also confrontational at times and has many layers underneath the ridiculously hilarious surface - this is for you. A solid 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
With no Spoiler.,"Honestly, if I could, I won't rate even 1 star. This xxx xxx only deserves negatives. This movie is awful. The lowest movie I have seen in my life. It causes me nightmares.

From the outset it slaps you in the face, punches you in the gut and finally goes below the belt for the final blows!! Every second word was a profanity, I'm no choir boy when it comes to swearing but WTF! The underlying plot of the movie was simple, predictable and centered around the ""love"" of a hot dog for a bun BUT there were definitely twists and turns in the story with the final twist ending the movie in an unexpected way. There were some really good characters in it, Edward Norton's voice as Bagel - excellent, and reminded me of a young Woody Allen.

The IMDb rating at the moment (6.2) is quite low as well the Rotten Tomatoes audience score (50%). Sausage Party can be defined as an R-rated version of Toy Story.

Eat mushrooms first.,"It's not very easy to find words to describe this movie. What is obvious, the World would be a better place without it. In general, I find Seth Rogen as some sort of Anti-Midas. Everything he touches turns into excrement. I read a few reviews of the movie (mostly very negative) but I decided to give it a fair chance. I'm not disturbed about jokes about religion nor am I very uptight about being politically correct. Maybe it's one of those misunderstood movies that are actually really good? Fat chance.What I, like many other reviewers, noticed first was the excessive use of curse words. Not that I have a problem with strong language but if it doesn't serve any other purpose than shock value, it's just lame. And truly lame it was in this movie. Then came the absurdly bad taste in jokes. Not bad taste in the sense of being vulgar or improper but childish, clichéd and simply stupid. I found penis/gay/racist jokes funny when I was twelve years old but not anymore, sorry. If you're an adult and watching this movie makes you laugh, I warmly suggest you take a good, long look in the mirror.Oh yeah, there was supposedly a deeper message in the movie about being open-minded and not believing what you're told at face value. It's just as bad as Damon Lindelof's sad dabbling with religious themes. Trying to make a very bad script have more depth by heavy-handedly inserting aspects about religion makes it only cluttered and worse.I did sit through the movie, mostly because I wondered if there would be even one thing that would make me laugh out loud. There wasn't. I snorted once or twice and that poor a reward is just not enough for the pain of tasting through the whole smorgasbord of absolutely untalented directing.By idiots for idiots, avoid at all costs.",1.0,Anonymous,Animation
This movie is awful and stupid,"This movie is the dumbest, most disgusting and vulgar, waste of 90 minutes that I have ever seen. I think Seth Rogen is brain damaged. Tasteless dialect, gross racist characterizations (Mexican Tequila Bottle, Selma Hayek Taco) served no purpose to further the story line..which was lacking at best. As a viewer I didn't sympathize with any of the characters, nor did I care what happened to them..because there is no plot. The ending of this movie was the weirdest and stupidest thing I have ever seen. None of the humor could be considered smart, with all of the jokes being on the nose. This movie is overrated in my opinion. If you are looking for adult content, watch Rob Zombies new movie 31, which is at least interesting and unusual.",1.0,Anonymous,Animation
"""Sausage Party""-  Clever scripting and amusing high-concept satire overcome the consistently hit-and-miss gags.","I'm honestly surprised it's taken so long for such a high-concept satire as ""Sausage Party"" to hit the big screens. A hardcore R-rated take on the incredibly popular works of companies like Disney/Pixar and Dreamworks Animation, the film is very much a timely sort-of parody of modern pop-culture giants while at the same time serving as a more broad and biting commentary on concepts like religion and bigotry. It's a film that's surprisingly far more clever than it's raunchy and suggestive title would imply, with plenty to say beneath the bodily function and drug- related gags that take up much of its screen time.Frank (voiced by co-writer Seth Rogen) is an anthropomorphic hot-dog living a seemingly idyllic existence in a supermarket, where the food view human customers as gods that will take them to a heavenly ""great beyond"" once they are purchased. He is also insanely devoted to his ""girlfriend"", a hot-dog bun next to him on the shelf named Brenda (Kristen Wiig) with whom he hopes to consummate a sexual relationship once they are ""chosen."" (Although it is strictly forbidden for them to do so before they ascend.) However, when a bottle of Honey Mustard reveals to Frank that the ""great beyond"" and indeed their religion as a whole is a lie, and a shopping cart accident flings he and Brenda out onto the floor, the two food items (along with a small supporting cast) go on a journey to learn the truth...The strength of the film lies in its clever and often shocking use of the computer-animated feature format to tell a fairly relevant and even troubling story using the most unlikely of characters. The film's commentary on blind religious devotion and conflict is actually quite well-developed and very amusing, raising many good points despite the cast being made up of foul-mouthed food-stuffs. Particularly uproarious is an ongoing dig at the Israeli-Palestinian conflict revolving around a lavash and a bagel respectively voiced by David Krumholtz and Edward Norton. (Yes, Edward Norton.) While some have bemoaned that the film- a glorified stoner-comedy filled to burst with sex gags and lowbrow humor- has tried to delve into more subversive and societal commentary, I actually applaud it. Yes, it's treatment of serious subject matter is quite broad and not particularly complex, but I found that it still worked very well and definitely gets you thinking about these matters. And that's nothing to sneeze at. If a talking hot-dog who drops f- bombs like it's nobodies business can actually get an atheist and his religious friends into a healthy and friendly debate as did indeed happen to me and my friends after viewing it, you know the film is doing something right.The cast and overall production is fairly top notch for the budget level and somewhat notoriously troubled production. Rogen is a capable and very charming lead in much of his work, and that continues here. He gives Frank a likable personality and you want to see him succeed. Wiig is a good bit of fun, particularly when her character is given a great deal of self-doubt as the film reaches its second act. Supporting roles by the likes of Jonah Hill, Michael Cera and the aforementioned Krumholtz and Norton are just a blast and add a lot of flavor (bad joke, I know) and laughs to the proceedings. And a surprise supporting role by Salma Hayek as a lesbian taco is a treat all around. Animation is smooth, fluid and nicely stylized, with a good visual aesthetic that is very reminiscent of early CGI animated features. Character design is very simple but elegant. And the limited but highly important song numbers are very tightly written and generally quite amusing.However, there is one issue that I have to mention, and it's where the film loses major points. And that is the humor, which I just unfortunately found to be a bit too hit-and-miss. When it works, it really works. And there are definitely enough big laughs and soft giggles to make it a worthwhile watch on the whole. But it does falter quite a bit, particularly early on. I know I can't be the only one to find the villain (a literal douche) to be grating and completely unfunny, which is troubling given his amount of screen time. (And yes, I understand that he's supposed to be unlikable... but he should still be able to get a chuckle out of the audience here and there.) A bizarre gag involving the song ""I Would Do Anything for Love"" seems very forced and out of left field. And it does take a bit too long for the major laughs to set in.Thankfully, the film's wonderful satirical elements keep the audience invested long enough for the story and the humor to hit its stride, and eventually the laughs do start to come at a mile-a- minute once the first act wraps up. And once it gets going, there's no stopping it. ""Sausage Party"" might be a bit of a troubled comedy due to a number of flat jokes early on, but its easily elevated thanks to the clever writing and bizarrely complex commentary that the script so excels at. While it might not go down as one of Seth Rogen's funniest films, it's still a great addition to his ever-growing body of work, and has a lot to say about the world behind all of the zany gags and foul jokes. And so I give it a good 8 out of 10. Definitely worth checking out.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

Really good movie if you are into crude and immature jokes.,"As the movie title and cover clearly portrays the type of film it will be, it succeeds in showing many inappropriate jokes throughout the movie. Although the jokes are not all about sex, it pokes a lot of other topics too. If you think about the script, they've been able to make fun of many topics and they should be applauded for that. They make fun of religion, drug users, men, women, Indians, gays and much more. Although the humor isn't for everyone, the plot is rather interesting by deciding to present what food would be like if they were alive is an interesting path to take. The characters are all distinct and are remembered. The main antagonist is surprisingly not one of the humans but actually another inanimate object which is a douche and ironically he is quite a douche in the movie which I found to be quite clever on the scriptwriters.With all of the good things said, the movie isn't perfect. In the near end of the movie, they take the literal use of the term ""food porn"" and it can be quite cringing especially of how long they drag out the scene. While there are plenty of inappropriate jokes throughout the movie, they are not afraid to be a bit controversial in some sections of the movie. Two scenes stuck out the most and one involved with the debate of reality verses religion. While the other scene can lead viewers to have uncomfortably witness a murder and rape. In terms of any sexual jokes, they seem to be really written by a 15 year old and it can push some of the mature adults away but the movie seems to really target young adults that seem to love sex jokes and are more open minded about everything. In fact I believe this movie is really intended for a small minority as the writers have essentially put up jokes that can offend anyone. If you have seen the trailers, you should know what to expect from the movie but for those who haven't, you'll be very disappointed and worse if you brought children to see this movie under the assumption that animated movies are meant for kids and that is the worst mistake that some one can make for a movie like this.

"Zany, irreverent, and foul: an all-star voice cast more than delivers","""Sausage Party"" (2016 release; 88 min.) brings the story of a group of grocery store food items. As the movie opens 9with a glorious opening song), we get to know Frank Wienerton, a sausage, and his friends. They are all hoping that today will be the day that a customer will choose them, so that they can 'go to the great beyond"" (i.e. leave the grocery store). Then one day, indeed Frank and a bunch of other food items are picked and tossed in a grocery cart, only to see things go wrong at the last minute. Is Frank stuck in the grocery store? To tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this movie is the brain child of Seth Rogen, who has for years been trying to bring this story to the big screen. Now finally a studio decided to fund it, and Rogen and his circle of friends came up with this zany, energy-jumping, extremely raunchy adult cartoon. ""We keep our wiener in our packages"", screams one of the sausages, and that's one of the more benign sexual double-entendres that pepper the movie. I assume you know yourself better than anyone else, so if this is going to bother you, do yourself a favor and stay away from this. I don't understand the many screaming headlines in other reviews that this is not for kids. The movie is rated R, so why would anyone even think about having kids watch this? The movie sports an incredible all-star voice cast: besides Rogen himself (in not one but two voice roles), there are Kirsten Wiig (as Rogen's girlfriend Brenda), Jonah Hill, Bill Hader, James Franco, Paul Rudd, Edward Norton, Salma Hayek, and many more. I mentioned the rounding opening musical number, and as it turns out the music is from none other than multiple Oscar and Grammy award winning composer Alan Menken, as well as Christopher Lennertz.Bottom line: ""Sausage Party"" is not for everyone. But if this is something that you think you might enjoy, it doesn't get much better than this this. The movie did much better than expected at the box office, and Rogen has already been quoted as saying he's been thinking about a sequel. Can't wait for that: ""Sausage Party 2: The Wiener Works""?",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
'Sausage Party (2016)' relies too heavily on one key joke: the animated food swears. And this goes on for eighty-nine minutes.,"'Sausage Party (2016)' is an animated comedy conceived by Seth Rogan and crew, a supposedly subversive satire centred on a single premise: its anthropomorphised animated food swears... a lot. The flick should have used its R rating to its advantage by telling a more adult, nuanced story that appeals to grown-up sensibilities and issues. Instead, all we get is a preposterous PG plot peppered prominently with plenty of profanity. Seriously, the only jokes in the film revolve around the characters cursing and that gets tiring after mere minutes. In fact, you very well may be tired of it after seeing the trailer. Once you accept that the food are all adults and will therefore say adult things using adult language, there is nothing to laugh about as no actual jokes are being made. There isn't any subtlety here, with immature crudity perforating the picture and seemingly replacing actual comedy at times. It is a missed opportunity, one with few surprises and even fewer laughs, which comes across as severely undercooked.The plot, as I said, is like something ripped straight out of Pixar's 'discarded ideas' pile. Instead of breaking down and circumventing the traditional Disney-esque formula, the film panders to it indefinitely. As such, the story is very generic and very predictable. The central premise is also inconsistent; some of the characters aren't actually food-stuffs (i.e. A condom or a toilet-roll) but still appear alive, whilst other similar objects aren't sentient at all (like shoes and shopping carts etc.). The other issue also comes when it is shown that cereal boxes and bags of crisps are sentient themselves, as opposed to the individual fillings, but the hot-dogs are shown to all be alive despite being contained in a packet similar to the aforementioned items. This hurts the credibility of the piece and, though it isn't a huge issue, it takes me out of the movie on more than one occasion. The actual narrative seems like it could be a kid's film, with a number of the jokes feeling ironically childish, so the added sexual humour and frequent cursing almost seem like an afterthought. Instead of using the R rating to its full potential to craft an adult tale, in the vein of other animated features like 'Anomalisa (2015)', the creators simply throw juvenile jokes and immature crudity at the proverbial wall and hope it sticks. This means that the feature seems like a one-trick pony, riding entirely on a premise that was funny in a 2-minute trailer but can't sustain itself for a full feature. It culminates in an outlandish third act that's a little too out there even for a movie about talking sausages. There is a scene towards the end that is very vulgar and over the top, but it isn't funny and goes on for ages. I can see why this would make people uncomfortable as it kind of comes out of nowhere and is very unnecessary. Plus, the final revelation is unearned and ridiculous - so much so that it leaves a sour taste in your mouth after the flick ends.The most glaring issue with the picture is that I don't find it funny at all. It made me crack a smile maybe once, which means that it sort of fails as a comedy. Like I mentioned, the food cursing gets old fast and starts to become a little obnoxious. Other than that key premise, there isn't much to laugh at aside from a few tired and oddly childish food puns. I'm not going to lie though, a gag about 'meatloaf' and a reference to 'Terminator 2: Judgement Day (1991)' were both subtle, fairly amusing and generally well done. The other main element to the piece is its satire; a hyper-stylised view of religion, as well as a push towards blatant atheism. It culminates in a pretty positive message of acceptance, teamwork, hope and respecting people's beliefs but is half-baked on the whole. The allegory doesn't gel properly with its real-life counterpart, meaning that it lacks in impact and ends up going around in circles. Every character is a stereotype, too, which some people may find offensive. There are no real character arcs and none of them have any depth; they mainly exist to illicit a chuckle at the expense of the culture, race or religion they represent without actually making a joke. The flick seems to think that stereotypically portraying a culture as a specific food-type is enough to count as clever comedy.The voice acting is all fairly good here but, aside from Edward Norton, the players aren't doing anything special; they are convincing though, giving off the appropriate emotions at the appropriate times, and can be quite nuanced occasionally. The animation itself isn't the best, but is competent and convincing despite a clearly lower budget. The actual CGI looks rubbery and the character designs, especially those of the humans, are often flawed. The people are pretty poor here, looking disproportionate and generally weird, but luckily there isn't too many of them. The music is generic and unnoticeable, with an opening musical number coming across as out of place, nonsensical and overly cheesy.Overall, 'Sausage Party (2016)' is an under-cooked disappointment that relies too much on a joke that was only moderately chuckle-worthy to begin with. Its animation is decent but not outstanding, its character designs are odd, its narrative is generic and their generally just isn't funny. I don't hate the film, of course. I mean, it isn't egregious and is certainly not the worst of the year. However, it could have, and should have, been much better: 4/10.",4.0,Anonymous,Animation

"Funny, but not nearly as funny as I wanted it to be","The biggest problem that I had with this movie is that while there were plenty of jokes that landed, they were few and far in between for much of the movie. There are big stretches of the film where characters are saying really shocking and raunchy things, but none of them got laughs. It would essentially feel like I was watching a hot dog and a bun just talk about sex in really grave detail, and when it wasn't funny, it just kinda felt weird to watch. It takes up until the last 20 minutes of the movie for it to be consistently funny, and when it got there I was laughing pretty much non stop until the end, but up until then it would be like a laugh every now and again. The jokes that do land are really funny, and this movie is incredibly creative and clever in a lot of different ways, and I think the way they depicted food being killed was genuinely hilarious, but if you're going to make a film this raunchy and dirty it needs to be hilarious through and through, otherwise it just comes off as immature and stupid, which is how a lot of the film felt to me.",4.0,Anonymous,Animation

It Smells Like a Dirty Diaper,"This turd floated onto NetFlix this week, that in itself says volumes. Great movies don't show up quickly or at all on NetFlix. But I gave it a look because while I don't have kids, I do have friends with children and they do not need to be exposed to this crap. Kids will ask to watch something and if you didn't know better, you might let them and have the legal system after you.The animated movie started by all the food singing about their various beliefs in religion. This is obviously anti-religion films to get a variety of groups upset and boost the hype. Sadly the only moral you come away with is; ""God or Gods don't exist. Have sex now with anyone, age, race, gender, or consent don't matter. Please yourself and get an orgy going because you are going to die and there is no reward except life itself. Do anything you want.""The idea that some nut has a religion trying to cram it down my throat sure doesn't appeal to me. Why does the creators of this crap think cramming atheism (another belief system) up my colon is going to be better?They did a bunch more stuff that was incredibly stupid and might I say irresponsible to promote as being ""cool"". Rape, bath salts, cannibalism, etc.. If I was a law enforcement officer after viewing this film, I would be keeping a close eye on those who took part in the making of this film.

"hilarious, immature, and let's be honest, cleverly written animated flick that is so R-rated it sometimes feels like too much","I really only have three gripes with this movie, so let's get them out of the way so I can praise it. One is lesser than the others, and that's the portrayal of the people. They're so utterly cartoonish (for the men; and oversexualized for the women) it's a level of absurd that feels gratuitous even for this movie. The second is the anti-religious theme, at times it's ubte and clever but more often than not it's way too in-your-face and tiring, which is coming from an atheist. My last and primary complaint is the profanity. We get it, you're rated R! The frequency of the F-word is so high it gets annoying early on, and again, this is coming from someone who thoroughly enjoys that word. But in this it just felt outlandishly forced. Now, the rest of the movie. Great voice acting all around, especially Kristin Wiig, Edward Norton, and Nick Kroll. The writing, while plagued by the excess F-word, was overall pretty clever in my opinion, the whole plot original and extremely creative. Also, getting Meat Loaf to sing in it AS meatloaf was ingenious. The animation itself is undeniably great and smooth. The hilariously explicit clax (pun intended) was laudably over-the-top. Now, the more I think about my complaints, the more I mean toward an 8, but I give a 9 for my sheer enjoyment and creativity props, although of course as a comedy and the immature material involved, it's highly subjective.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

"Sausage Party has it's delicious moments, even if the crass novelty becomes repetitive","Animation has the ability to give live to things that we previously would have never considered. Disney and Pixar in particular have brought cars, toys, rats, bugs, fish, and robots a humanized life and a study on what their purpose is, now with thoughts and feelings. There's a magic within that, so it's not uncommon for other things we could explore to see what their perspective of the world would be like. For toys in Toy Story, it's a joy land of children and imagination, but with a dark side of childhood eventually ending. For bugs in A Bugs Life, it's more of a survival of the fittest as their several kinds of insects out there. How about food?Today's movie shows that food may have the worst when it comes to their purpose. Writer and actor Seth Rogan not only wanted to explore what that world of humanized food would be like, but to do in his adult context. R rated animated movies are a rarity, but it's nice to see a studio like Sony take a chance on a risk. You could even argue that because adult cartoons are more popular on television now, R rated animated films could have a bigger opportunity. Let's see if Sausage Party invoke more adult animated stories.In a market called ""Shopwells"", each morning opens with the food signing (it's made clear in the beginning that people cannot see them move or talk) about their desire to be chosen by the ""gods"" to be taken out of the store into the ""Great Beyond"". One area with all the forth of July food, contains sausages and buns. One sausage, Frank (played by Seth Rogan), along with Carl (played by Jonah Hill) and Barry (played by Michael Cera) are hoping to be chosen with a set of buns next to them, which contains Frank's girlfriend, Brenda (played by Kristen Wiig).When a jar of honey mustard commits suicide, this causes the shopping cart where the sausages and buns were chosen to collapse. This causes Frank and Brenda to slip out of their packaging, leaving them behind in the store while everyone else goes to the ""Great Beyond"". Frank and Brenda are told to go to a set of imperishable foods to learn the truth about their existence. Along the way, they encounter a taco lesbian Teresa (played by Selma Hayek), a Jewish bagel Sammy Bagel Jr (played by Edward Nortin) and bottle of Liquor Firewater (played by Bill Hader).I cannot stress enough of how important it is to understand that Sausage Party is not for children. I'm twenty-nine and I'm not old enough for this. I'm not even sure if my parents are old enough for this. There is so much swearing, violence, and sexual content (including a three minute food orgy somewhere), that Sausage Party has earned it's R rating and them some. Within all the crass is a well-written script that is sort of an analogy to real life religion. While I wouldn't call this movie an atheist story, I can understand that many people would be turned off.I can defiantly say it's a smart script, though I'll admit that the constant crass does wear off after a while. It's funny, but when your dialogue is almost nothing but swears, it makes for a repetitive attitude that I doubt the film is aware of. Story wise, it does feel a little stretched (and this is an eighty minute movie). Part of me thinks this might have worked better as an hour long special on Netflix, but you can still tell by the number of comedians in this along with some great animation that Sausage Party has it's moments.I'll give this five hot dog sausages out of ten. Sausage Party is an acquired taste movie, and though I might watch it once more, I can see a lot of people playing this at parties. Speaking of which, Sausage Party is an ADULT PARTY ONLY. LEAVE THE KIDS AT HOME!",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
Get your facts right,"You see, I understand this is a parody of religions and religious people, but the one thing that bothered me most of all was how they depicted the conflict in Palestine as being between Muslims and Jews. It's not a religious conflict, you so-called writers who wrote this long, lame joke of a movie, and it's not about having enough ""room on the shelf"" for everyone, it's about Zionists stealing the lands of the people who have lived there for centuries, Muslims, Christians or whatever, and mass-murdering them for the past 70+ years. Yeah sure you seem to think it can all be solved if everyone f***** each other, but I assure you our leaders have been doing that for years, they are making sweet love to the racist, criminal Zionist leaders and it seems to be going great for them as they are getting richer and richer while the people continue to be killed, their houses continue to be demolished and their lands occupied.

Test your friends,"This movie was designed as a scientific test for the purpose of finding out more about the people you know. You make them watch this movie and then ask them what they thought of it. If someone starts talking about how it's just offensive and vulgar rather than funny, well, that's how you know if you want to hang out with them or not. It is interesting to see how the reviews for this movie fluctuate so much, and that is not a coincidence.The plot feels loose. Seems like it was never very important. The makers had a number of scenes or dirty jokes they wanted to make and loosely strung them together with a single premise: what if food products didn't know what happens to them after a human buys them, which is in itself a set-up for a few minutes of average stand-up comedy material. Mostly, this movie is a vulgar racist d*ck joke, and what sells the said d*ck joke is creative animation and a good delivery.The humour is hit and miss, yes, that is true. Mostly, it's very harsh and direct. The entertainment value is in the degree of vulgarity and bluntness. If you do not think that extreme vulgarity can be funny on its own then this is movie is not for you (and I'm sorry, but we can't be friends).Is this movie worth watching more than once? No. Absolutely not.Is it funny? In the case of this movie, it really depends on your sense of humour.Personal sidenote: I don't understand how The Interview got the same score as this movie.

In the Category of Best Cartoon Ever,"9.6 of 10.

Teens and up should be viewing this, not that requiring it will be necessary. The combination of comedy, sexual innuendo, music, and action will draw viewers to it and keep interest rising.

An R-rated adult version of Toy Story that is really an indictment on hard core religious followers. I absolutely loved it.,"""Everything we've been led to believe is a lie."" Frank (Rogen) and the rest of the food in the supermarket dream of one day being chosen and taken away. They dream of a utopia and think its the best thing that can happen. After a jar of honey mustard comes back from the outside the things he says challenges everything they know. Now Frank, Branda (Wiig) and the rest of the food must look for the real answer before its too late. This is a movie that is not for everyone, at all.

Original,"This movie really took food to a different level. I really appreciate this, because my own personal beliefs have dictated that everything has a living space within our lives. This movie elaborated on that, in the essence that, all of what we do and think and feel within a supermarket is within a grasp of reality that is not easily obtained by sheer logistic measure. I'm not saying that things in the supermarket are alive or dead. But what I am saying, from a consumer point of view, is that we are all much better off with our ability to just grab and go then we might realize. This cartoon is original, and you haven't seen anything like it before. It contains adult context and the ability to entertain at the same time. Was it meant to be a movie on your shelf? No, but it was meant to appeal to you as an adult. Children should not watch this movie, and you should make it your mission to make sure that they don't!

Flat,"Im giving 5 stars in comparing this animation to other good animation with good stories. First, the story is just mediocre, like an adult version of low budget toy story. Is not a breakthrough story, more like emoji movie kind of story. Second, I appreciate the idea of matching the story to nowadays issues, like religious and racial issues. I get the messages that they want to tell us about god and creation, human relations and love. Third, There is so many things that cannot make sense like how the foods walking, (while toy story make it more logical, like the toys is 'play dead' when there are human around.) Overall, this animation is not so bad about the meaning, but I can't really enjoy the jokes, really just flat emotions throughout the film.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
Truely Amazing But Funny,"Sausage Party is an adult animated comedy film that takes place in Shopwell's supermarket. Life is good for all the food items that occupy the shelves at the local supermarket. Frank (Seth Rogen), the sausage, Brenda (Kristen Wiig), the hot dog bun, Teresa Taco, and Sammy Bagel Jr. (Edward Norton) can't wait to go home with a happy customer. The once-happy supermarket shelves are plunged into chaos and despair as poor Frank learns the horrifying truth that they will eventually become meals. After warning his pals about their similar fate, the panicked perishables devise a plan to escape from their human enemies.I like the film because it's funny, irreverent, and cleverer than its premise suggests. My favorite character is Frank, a heroic sausage who is willing to help the other foods and who dreams of living with his significant other, Brenda, in the Great Beyond. Frank is different from the other hot dogs, as they long for proof or evidence of their belief system. He is also inquisitive and determined to find out the truth. Frank is taught many things while growing up in Shopwell's grocery store, including that hot dogs ""grow up.""
I would recommend this 5-star film to anyone under 17 who needs an adult to see it, and it is suitable for adults who enjoy raunchy humor and satire.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
"""edgy"" comedians trying to out swear eachother","I normally wouldn't even notice profanity or bad language in movies, there a place for it in story telling, showing emotion or even comedic purposes but this was just weird. It was like they ran weren't confident in the jokes standing on their own merit so bolstered them with just the most over the top poor language iv heard since listening in on truckers talking over the uhf. It just made the whole thing weird and try hardish. Iv never really found seth rogan funny so maybe it's my biased opinion of him but I just thought the movie missed on a topic that had potential.",3.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Best Animated Film For Adults, in History!","This film is hilarious! The actors are the new generation's funniest actors! This' the funniest adult animated film since, ""Fritz, The Cat""! It's much funnier! If you think about it? It actually has a deep message! That is, if you're not too ""Baked"" watching it? You can't help it! It's there! However, the film was made for laughs & it's got great lines & some animated scenes, that will blow your mind! The main song, should have been nominated for an Oscar by the Academy! As usual, the academy never takes comedy seriously, like all other art forms!",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Just bad,"I went in expecting some silly, crude, easy watching adult humour. What I got was something that just wasn't funny at all. I turned it off after an hour, very bored.It's a bit like if you go out in a group and there's an annoying person out with you and no matter how hard they over try, they just can't get a laugh. That's what this is like. A person with a lame sense of humour desperately trying to get laughs.Now I did laugh a couple of times but considering the film had nothing else there and was attempting to be a comedy, and nothing but a comedy it was just an empty shell. No great sound, character design, character development, story etc. None of that. The jokes, puns and sarcasm were just not good enough to carry this rubbish.",1.0,Anonymous,Animation
