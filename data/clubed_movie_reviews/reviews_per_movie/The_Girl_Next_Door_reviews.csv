Strange but appealing,"The Girl Next Door is just simply an entertaining movie.  It's got plenty of flaws - almost every single scene of the second half of the film seems to act as the climax, and then the movie keeps going - but it's also got one of the most appealing casts I've seen in a while.  Emile Hirsh (Dangerous Lives of Altar Boys, Emperor's Club) is the central character Matthew, about to graduate from high school.  He's just plain likable.  The drop-dead gorgeous Elisha Cuthbert (Kim Bauer on 24, in a very different type of role here) is the title character, Danielle.  Matthew's two friends and one of Danielle's associates played by Tim Olyphant are particular standouts in terms of comic relief; the movie is genuinely funny.  Funny, a bit silly, and at times honestly sweet, it's an entertaining movie that's harmless and worth seeing.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
One of the best teens movies ever made for the 21th century.,"Matthew Kidman (Emile Hirsch) is a high school student and he is also a straight laced overachiever. Matthew never really lived life until he falls for his hot new neighbor (Elisha Cuthbert). But Matthew and his new neighbor have a nice relationship going until Matthew's close friend (Chris Marquette) discover that Matthew's girlfriend is a former porn star. Matthew's sheltered existence spins out of control.Directed by Luke Greenfield (The Animal) made an fresh, somewhat original High-School/Romantic outrageous comedy. Hirsch is a young likable leading man. Cuthbert is simply beautiful. The film's scene stealing performance is Timothy Olyphant as a Porn's Producer. The film also stars:James Remar (The Warriors) and Paul Dano (L.I.E.) in nice supporting roles.DVD gas an sharp anamorphic Widescreen (1.85:1) transfer (Also in Pan & Scan) and an fine-Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. DVD also has an commentary track by the director and a trivia track.The Unrated DVD has the same Widescreen transfer and sound quality with the same commentary track by the director and a trivia track. The DVD new features are a behind the scenes featurette, an extremely funny featurette, a hilarious hidden feature and more. Some people might call this ""Risky Business"" meets ""American Pie"". But this is a good hearted wild comedy. Do not miss this. Screenplay by Staurt Blumberg (Keeping the Faith), David T. Wagner (National Lampoon's Van Wilder) and Brent Goldberg (Underclassmen).

Reminds me of what teen films used to be,"Oh, to a neighbor like Elisha Cuthbert.  Not that my neighbors are bad. Want a cup of sugar?  Just knock.  Want help will the ball cock in your toilet?  Ring next door.  All of this is incredibly beneficial, but oh, to have a neighbor like Elisha Cuthbert!Elisha plays the 'girl' in the new teen film The Girl Next Door directed by Luke Greenfield (The Animal).  Her name is Danielle and she arrives just when neighbor Mathew Kidman (Emile Hirsch) is writing a speech in hopes of getting a scholarship for his portrayal of moral fiber.  But one look at the stripping Danielle from his bedroom window to hers leaves every fiber pointing in a different direction.This small act of voyeurism leads to all sorts of trouble as Danielle notices her admirers' gazing and immediately heads next door to confront young Matthew.  The result of their new courtship would lead to public nudity, breaking and entering, skipping school, taking drugs and everything else that we used to brag about without merit in High School.And just as everything seems to be going extremely well for the young Matthew, one of his geek buddies reveals her true identity, that of an up-and-coming porn star.  This revelation comes shortly before the arrival of her pimp film producer Kelly (Deadwood's Timothy Olyphant) who throws a wrench into the infatuational plans of the two neighbors and leads Matthew down a path that jeopardizes his endeavor to win the scholarship.   Soon, Kelly and Matthew are attending strip clubs, meeting in Vegas and eventually, the two are involved in a robbery where Matt tries to win the freedom of the young Danielle.Much has been made of The Girl Next Door's resemblance to the 1983 Tom Cruise film Risky Business.  Truly, the comparisons cannot be more obvious. Instead of hookers, we have porn stars.  Instead of a house party, we have a prom, and where there is a family heirloom in play with Cruise's film, Hirsch must pull out all the stops in order to obtain a $25,000 bank account that was amassed to bring a Cambodian teenager to America.But with all these comparisons evident, I enjoyed The Girl Next Door more. The High School situations have been updated, and I believed in how Matthew could be easily drawn into his world of love and admiration, something I didn't feel with Cruise and DeMornay.Don't get me wrong, The Girl Next Door will not have the impact of Risky Business nor will it be the catapult for either Hirsch or Cuthbert that Business was for Cruise.  But it still was a rather enjoyable film.  Not filled with situations bordering on the asinine (see American Pie's 2 through 3), The Girl Next Door was a smart film that resembled a John Hughes film of the early 1980's.  I enjoyed all the characters from the geeks who are trying to find their sexual niche to the awkwardness and mature awakening of Matthew through the ordeal of following his dreams.  Whereas adolescent films recently have skewed into gross out comedy in such entries as The New Guy, American Pie and Van Wilder, The Girl Next Door gives us something fresh, a progressive out of character plot backed by the love of a beautiful woman.All these funny and interesting struggles lead to the senior prom where the result might seem far fetched, but at least it seems as if the director meant it not to be taken with any notion of seriousness.  We understand the good guys from the bad guys and the movie makes no attempts to throw a surprise or two our way.  Maybe in its simplicity, it has found the answer to rejuvenating the youthful film movement.So, back to my original blabbering.   Oh, to have a neighbor like Elisha Cuthbert!  First noticed wearing pink panties in the 2003 popular film Old School, she is something to behold.  But can she fix a ball cock?  Don't answer that!",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
The sweetest R-rated (or 15 certificate) movie in recent memory.,"Responsibility for ""The Girl Next Door""'s poor performance at the US box office - as well as over here - can be laid firmly at the feet of Twentieth Century Fox's marketing people; the tagline ""Matt never saw her coming - but all his friends had!"" made it seem like a full-on sex comedy, when it's actually a lot more than that; director Luke Greenfield and writers Stuart Blumberg, David T. Wagner and Brent Goldberg put more emphasis on the characters than the raunch, which makes all the difference. There's more to the movie than the sight of Elisha Cuthbert in a thong (in interviews she revealed that it is indeed her there... if not elsewhere in the movie).The debt this movie owes to ""Risky Business"" - starting with the score by ex-Tangerine Dream member Paul Haslinger (Tangerine Dream scored ""Risky Business"") - is pretty clear; both movies have bright but slightly life-challenged graduate students given to fantasising about things that go wrong as their main characters (step forward Emile Hirsch as the sympathetic hero), both have sex-obsessed best friends, both have women in the sex business as the main female characters who come into the hero's uptight life and help to liberate him, and both have sleazy male bosses (Timothy Olyphant plays the Guido equivalent). The movie also has the same mostly restrained view of its story where other movies would have played up the farce aspects - the only real hi-jinks come when the movie's plot takes in the Adult Film Convention in Las Vegas - but ""The Girl Next Door"" is a lot more engaging and has a lot more heart than ""Risky Business"" (good though that movie is, charm is not its strong point), with the title character seen as more of a person than a masturbatory object both by our hero and by the movie. When she goes with a motel with him and starts to play up The Porn Star, you really hope they don't go through with it.The mood set up in the early stages is so convincing that when Olyphant's porn producer character turns up the movie seems to turn into another one entirely (and if you go to see this because of Elisha's ""one for the men"" status, I must warn you that she spends alarming amounts of time off-screen); it's still a good one, but it damages the overall movie's tone, and for most of the rest of the movie it veers back and forth between sweet and sleazy... but the amazing thing is that ""The Girl Next Door"" actually manages to find a happy balance of the two by the time the prom climax arrives (with more echoes of ""Risky Business"" en route, for sure).True, there's no actual sex seen and little nudity, but the cast works so well and the movie's so sincere that by the end it doesn't seem like a ripoff. With good use of songs blending with the score, well-done fantasy sequences, and a welcome dose of intelligence in its writing, ""The Girl Next Door"" is probably the most adorable movie to get an R rating since ""Pretty Woman,"" and well worth seeing even if you don't have a thing for Kim off ""24."" But this isn't for the ""Daily Sport"" crowd. Which is their loss.""The juice was worth the squeeze.""",,Anonymous,Romance
This movie actually managed to surprise me!,"I went in for what I thought would be the typical teen rom-com of the early 2000s, with the usual pattern (common to many movies actually): 1. Protagonist isn't satisficed with their situation 2. Something unexpected happens and things are starting to get better 3. When things are good they start falling apart, culminating with a real bad thing leaving them worst off than when they started but 4. In the last act they figure out what went wrong and fix everything; happy ending. That movie went through that cycle twice when I realized I was only halfway through and I really didn't know where they were going with it, which was refreshing. The story is fairly original, and the actors are all doing a decent job. Fun, entertaining, and original; recommended!",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
DIFFERENT,"The movie starts with all the vibes of a classic teenage movie with high school prom, football events, popular kids vs unpopular etc.... but after Danielle(the girl on the poster) starts to establish herself in the movie everything changes..... The story becomes original by using sexy situations in a different, more naive ways, showing the love between a senior in high school and a young girl with an interesting past through some weird situations.It's a funny sexy comedy with actors well guided by the director. Feels like a better edition of american pie movies and i think is oriented on the same audience.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Timothy Olyphant shines,"This is an enjoyable yet ultimately forgettable film. The ""boy rescues cute girl from terrible life"" plot has been done many times before, no doubt in many better ways. Emile Hirsch performs passably well with the material he is given, and the luscious Elisha Cuthbert provides plenty of eye candy that she could not show in 24. The rest of the characters are one-dimensional and barely worthy of mention. But the show belongs to Timothy Olyphant. Although he does not even appear until halfway through the film, his role makes the entire movie worth watching again. He screen presence is palpable as the ultra-cool bad boy that every man secretly wishes to be. Scruffy, chain-smoking, alternately funny, friendly then dangerous, he owns every scene in which he appears. Seeing this film makes one that much more anxious for the next season of JUSTIFIED to begin!",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Random plot, not fun, just dumb","Why did I see this movie? Why did someone make this movie? I can't answer either of these questions. This movie had an unsatisfying, disturbing, boring and demented plot. Partially funny moments were mixed with disturbing scenes of cruelty and randomness (lots of adults being mean to kids - lovely). I came out of the theatre feeling annoyed and extremely uninspired. The themes in this movie were incredibly superficial - what about the ""I'm so ashamed to be a porn-star"" theme - all I have to say about this is ""what!?!"" The acting was bad and there was no subtlety or beauty. I strongly discourage the viewing of this movie - I'd rather blow my nose with sandpaper (continuously).",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
The juice is definitely worth the squeeze,"Here we have a great example of how decent writers, armed with creative juice to spare, can take a well-worn plot and rework it to make it seem fresh.  Just when you think you've got the next twist figured out, you're surprised.  This happens throughout the movie, making The Girl Next Door one of the most charming, smart and subversive teen comedies I've seen in a long time - beautifully written, perfectly cast, a real pleasure from start to finish.Emile Hirsch, Elisha Cuthbert and Timothy Olyphant shine in their respective roles as the young man at a crossroads in his life, the girl next door of the title, equally confused, and the scuzball with a heart who knows he has to do the right thing even if it goes against his 'business instincts.' These characters are not one-dimensional, thanks to the superb writing, nor are they caricatures; they come across as genuine individuals, and the comedy in the film comes not at their expense but rather organically, as part of their journey. As Olyphant's character asks Hirsch at one point: ""Is the juice worth the squeeze?"" In this case, it most definitely is.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Could have been a really good movie.,"Sadly this movie is centered around the pornography industry and therefore tries to promote their own self interests.  Hollywood using another movie to try and justify all the sex and profanity it likes to push off on the American public and call it art.  Instead of portraying the porn industry and it leaders as the sleeze balls they are who pray on young women, it makes them out to look like honorable people with a heart for others. Take out the nudity, the profanity, and change the scenario around a little and this could have been a really good movie.  I would hope parents will keep their teenagers away from this movie and send a message to Hollywood.  The most popular movies ever made that grossed the most income were not movies of this type.  When will movie producers ever get that?",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
Engaging Homage to 80's Teen Flicks...,"THE GIRL NEXT DOOR, Luke Greenfield's sexy yet sweet teen angst flick, owes a lot to both the RISKY BUSINESS premise (HS Senior, his goal a prestigious college, has his life turned 'upside-down' by world-wise 'Pro'), and the internal structure of John Hughes' 80's teen 'classics' (geeky hero, and his two geekier friends, gain acceptance and prestige through his relationship with a 'dream girl').Close your eyes, and you could easily picture the young Anthony Michael Hall or John Cusack filling Emile Hirsch's role, with Rebecca De Mornay or Kelly Preston replacing Elisha Cuthbert as his ex-porn star girlfriend. THE GIRL NEXT DOOR, however, actually works quite well, thanks to Greenfield's 'tongue-in-cheek' approach to the naughtiness, and a flawless supporting cast, particularly Timothy Olyphant as a likable but ultimately ruthless porn producer, and Timothy Bottoms and Donna Bullock, as Hirsch's clueless but blindly supportive parents.Emile Hirsch shows a propensity towards 'soulfully earnest' expressions, but does provide one of the film's funniest scenes, as, while high on Ecstasy, he attempts to navigate through a crowd awaiting his speech on 'high moral fiber'. While some critics tended to brush off Elisha Cuthbert's performance as just another skin-baring 'boy toy' variation, she actually conveys the vulnerability and pain of her character's past quite effectively, balancing it with sly humor and a LOT of 'sex appeal', done within the restraints of her ""No Nudity"" contract clause...Sorry, guys, while you'll see a LOT of her skin, you AREN'T going to see Elisha 'bare all'...The film is a very funny, breezy lark, and while it never achieves the heights of insanity of RISKY BUSINESS, it certainly stands as one of the better 'teen' comedies of the past few years!",,Anonymous,Romance
Simple Fun,"One of those simple but fun teenage coming of age comedies they don't do anymore - a movie everyone straight can relate to, carried by heartwarming characters and a super sexy and funny Elisha Cuthbert. No Oscar material but one of those simple fun movies that take you back in time to your own school days, if you, like me, belong to an older generation. The Girl Next Door = funny, sexy, entertaining. Not as strong as 10 Things I Hate About You, but almost.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
I like it,"Ok, far from being the best movie in the world, it has many gaps in rhythm and narrative, especially in the second half of the script, which is confusing and poorly constructed. Let's just say the plot lacked ideas to resolve the story and pushed too hard to create a final rom-com solution in any way. Basically, the movie started with a very good premise, but got lost and invented some solution to end it.Having said that, I still loved the movie. A great soundtrack, wonderful and handpicked songs, very well fitted in each scene, and a work of practically perfect actors. I can't really explain why Elisha Cuthbert didn't become a celebrity, she is simply beautiful and an excellent actress in the film, working in a measured way, without exaggeration and perfect in the role. The same can be said about practically the entire cast, all very well, the actors' direction is great.My final rating is 7 out of 10 because it really lacks a solid story to follow up on the sympathetic initial idea of the first 30 to 40 minutes of the film.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Just Go With It,"The Girl Next Door isn't a riotous, laugh-out-loud comedy, à la American Pie or Road Trip (don't get me wrong, I think they are fine movies of a different genre), nor should it be treated as such when being reviewed. It's much more mature, a sweet delight of a story that has you chuckling in amusement rather than rolling on the floor guffawing. For that, I would hardly even classify it in the generic 'comedy' genre. I must admit, I did go in thinking that I'd spend two hours of my life enjoying yet another teen comedy, with an overdone plot, jokes bordering on distasteful, and up to the brim with gratuitous nudity. However, I came out with so much more.It's a classic tale of boy-meets-girl, boy falls in love with girl, boy lives happily ever after with girl. But what makes The Girl Next Door stand out from the rest is the superb cast. The casting director did a great job, placing Emile Hirsch opposite Elisha Cuthbert (both very talented young up-and-coming actors, I wish them well in luck, love and life). The pair's on-screen chemistry is undeniably electric. They portrayed Matthew and Danielle's relationship perfectly  loving and tender, yet fragile. This boy has fallen hopelessly in love for the first time, with the girl of his dreams. He has no past experience to draw on, he's terrified and confused, and he doesn't know what to do! As director Luke Greenfield pointed out in his commentary (Unrated DVD is a must-have for the hardcore fans), Emile and Elisha were chosen for their ability to act without dialogue, simply with their eyes. The subtleties in each expression brings so much more to the characters when watched closely in detail  every nervous bite of the lip, every slight mischievous arch in the eyebrow  you can tell exactly what they're thinking. Now, I've seen my fair share of movies/TV shows, and I'd be confident in saying that I have not yet seen another actor/actress able to fill those roles as perfectly and effortlessly as Emile and Elisha did. They must've poured their hearts out into these characters, bringing them to life, their romance blossoming on-screen.And how can we ignore the superb supporting cast? Timothy Olyphant and Chris Marquette's work on this movie was simply priceless. They provided the comedy and laughs, and it would be impossible to list all of their hilarious one-liners here. A lot of people claim that they made the movie, and though I disagree, I can sure see where they're coming from.And the music, oh, the music. I came of no great surprise to me to learn that Luke Greenfield writes all his projects to music. It is this unique trait that embellishes the movie with such a vivid background. From Bowie & Queen's ""Under Pressure"" opening montage to The Who's ""Baba O'Riley"" closing credits, every single song is perfect for its scene, particularly David Gray's ""This Year's Love"", mine and many other's favourite song in the soundtrack. It kicks in at the exact right moment and manages to capture everything about this innocent, pure, high school romance. Also, Paul Haslinger (second to none at composing scores) wrote some of his best work for The Girl Next Door. Simply put (again, stealing lines from the director) Haslinger is deadly with a piano. Each score enhances and fills the moment with such tension and suspense, most notably ""Peeping Matt"", when Matthew watches this gorgeous creature undressing through his window for the first time. There is an element of voyeurism and the excitement of the danger of being caught, as he watches the female movement and form unravelling with fascination and awe. He simply can't keep his eyes off her. It's a scene that many of us can connect with.This is indeed one of those movies that ought to be watched on a DVD, at night, alone, rather than on a huge screen in the cinema with others. You'll find yourself leaving the end with a bittersweet aftertaste  will I find that special someone like Danielle? Do I need to be broken out of my shell? Is the juice worth the squeeze? Sure, it is an idealist fantasy, but it's also sweet, endearing and full of heart. It's how an old-school love story ought be done. Just suspend your belief for two hours, and watch the magic happen. Hell, just go with it.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Adolescent fantasy coming true. Nicer than what I expected.,"Have a look at this funny teenager movie. It's about a geekish boy meeting a porn star, having her fall in love with him, then ending up together. The plot was unusually thick for this kind of movies and not too cliché.Timothy Oliphant (who I think shows a lot of promise as an actor) stars in this one in a secondary role. Beautiful Elisha Cuthbert is playing the porn star. James Remar also has a part.I have to say that overall the movie was too fantastic to be believable, but then again, it is about adolescent fantasies and ""power to the geek"" things, so it wasn't supposed to feel real. I do hate when they put good lookers in the role of losers and they tag them as losers with weird glasses, thick shirts or pull-overs. I mean, all you have to do to be popular is loose the glasses, clothes and half a brain. Yeah, right! No wonder so many American teens are screwed up.Conclusion: cute love story, nice movie for its category, must see with girlfriend.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Kind of a homage to Risky Business but much more than that,"I did not see this movie in theaters. I usually wait for teen films to come out on video before viewing them. I must say, the way this movie was marketed, one would figure that this flick is along the lines of such classics as Bring It On and Can't Hardly Wait. Though this movie definitely is now part of the illustrious teen film library, it runs a little bit deeper than the average adolescent flick.As the title suggest, this movie does have Risky Business written all over it. The characters (the pimp vs the adult film director) the props (glass egg vs the golden ""trophy"") as well as the music and language definitely give this film an updated twist on RB. However, it would be erroneous to write this film off as a rip-off, it just isn't afraid to show it's influence.Emile Hirsch is great as Matthew Kidman, the ambitious high school senior (who actually looks like he's in high school) with an Ivy League future. Straight and narrow, his life is spun on it's head once Danielle (Elisha Cuthbert) enters the picture. Cuthbert, playing a free-spirited porn star, actually gives a rather understated performance that is sincere and sweet. Matthew's once planned out life is now lived more on the edge, and with that, he encounters some interesting characters, such as Kelly, the shady porn director, played flawlessly by Timothy Olyphant.However, as the film progresses, the movie didn't delve as deeply into Cuthbert's character as it should have. No insight into her background, how did she get to where she is right now, etc. She also takes a back seat to the growing tension between the Matthew and the sleazebag Kelly. I must say, Olyphant is great in this film. He goes from being hilarious to charming to scary in the span of about five minutes and steals almost every scene he's in. The other supporting characters are great. Chris Marquette (Eli) and Paul Dano (Klitz) are funny as Hirsch's dorky friends, and hopefully Marquette will land more roles like this. They too seem to become more adventurous once Danielle enters the picture, what an influence one person can have.So in the end, this does have a lot of the typical teen flick campiness. There are jocks, hot chicks on campus, geeks, and the movie itself has plenty of swearing, bathroom humor, slapstick, you name it. There is a sweetness to the movie, as it's amazing what a person will do when they fall in love. This movie has plenty of twists and turns, so come along for the ride and have some fun.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

But he says he is a problem solver, so how will he extricate himself from this problem? After all, he is quite naive, and those he is up against are playing for keeps.

Underrated romantic comedy.,"In many respects, this film is overlooked and underrated.Emile Hirsch and Elisha Cuthbert have fantastic chemistry and make for an easy couple to root for throughout the film. Timothy Olyphant plays a charismatic and enigmatic villain who is also entertaining to watch.Some of the scenes aren't well-written, but they're compensated for by a strong message and highly well-written verbal cues, which include callbacks to lines from earlier in the film.This film has far higher reachability than most, and I applaud it for that.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

Fans of Elisha will not be disappointed in this sweet movie,"So yes most guys are going to see the movie because of the achingly beautiful and hot Elisha Cuthbert. And she only disappoints a little. Otherwise this is the perfect vehicle for her playing a porn star who is trying to change her ways and live more of a normal teen-age girl's life. As she stays at her aunt's house, she meets her next door neighbor after he spies on her undressing. I think a lot of guys will be able to relate to Emile Hirsch's character--a young guy who is trying so hard to break out of his shell. Along comes Elisha who is more worldly and adventurous and who actually likes him. He'd follow this girl anywhere and not one of us could blame him for girls like this rarely come along in life.The plot is somewhat predictable but the movie has enough funny, quirky and memorable characters that you will enjoy it anyway. There is one very memorable kiss which takes place at a party, while David Gray's ""This Years Love"" plays in the background. This same song plays again at the end when they are in the limo, but interestingly enough the song is not included on the movie soundtrack CD??? For guys like myself who are a little older, the movie represents a time in life when anything is possible and within reach if you just have that unreachable,beautiful woman by your side. Thing is, most young guys never believe they could get a girl like Elisha. So the movie is about much more than a porno star moving next door. Its about taking risks, putting your heart out there, reaching for what you want even though it appears unreachable. And finally, God, is Elisha Cuthbert just unreal!!!",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Very Sexy and Funny Comedy,"Matthew Kidman (Emile Hirsch) is a non-popular nerd in his high-school, having just two friends, Eli (Chris Marquette) and Klitz (Paul Dano), and concerned with the situation of a Cambojean student and in getting a scholarship to Georgetown. When the sexy Danielle (Elisha Cuthbert) comes to live in the next door, they date and fall in love for each other. Later, Matthew finds that Danielle was a porn star, but when her former boyfriend and producer Kelly (Timothy Olyphant) visits her and invites her to return to the porn industry, the situation gets out of hand of Matthews and he gets into serious trouble.""The Girl Next Door"" is a very sexy and funny comedy, and the confusions that Matthew gets into are hilarious. There are many elements of ""Risky Business"" in this movie, and the greatest modification is that Danielle is not a prostitute like Lana (Rebecca de Mornay), and I believe the writer got inspiration in that 1983 comedy to write this story. Elisha Cuthbert is extremely sexy and perfect for the role of Danielle, and Emile Hirsch fits very well for his character. However, Timothy Olyphant ""steals all the scenes"" as Kelly.

If this is trying to send a message that ""Pretty Woman"" tried to convey, then it surely fails amongst all the breasts, porn references and the mention of the F-word.

Very watchable indeed,"What a lovely, lovely film.This is definitely not a stereotypically vacuous teen flick. Quite the contrary. It is exactly what I presume it set out to be - an accessible, friendly feel-good treat. And here's why: From a male point of view - such a sizable dose of Elisha Cuthbert is delightful. Her acting is very suitably sexy, lacking in depth maybe, but then that is excused by the generally simple format of the film. There are some genuinely funny moments, the comedy is very varied, as opposed to the one-level 'American Pie' toilet humour of most other films in this genre. There are some nice twists and turns, and it's all very nicely satisfying.It is definitely worth a watch, for sure. If nothing else than because the way that this film embodies that feeling of everything in your life being overwhelmingly wonderful.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Awesome Comedy that also passes as a serious Romance film,"This movie is really superb.At first if you see the trailer it just appears to be a stupid teen comedy about porn.This is not true.I feel for these characters because I am also going to be graduating soon and I don't know what I am going to be doing with my life. The main character Matt is your straight A student with goals of going to Georgetown and becoming a politician.He and his friends are facing their last year in high school and they are somewhat nerds.Matt then sees a beautiful girl in a window of his neighbors house.After a little street performance they start to spend time together....eventually dating.Then the trouble hits.If you haven't seen of heard anything about the movie then I won't ruin it for you.The long and short of it is that this is a unique comedy that turns into a true romance film.I love this movie,the way it was shot,the comic elements,and the romantic elements all make this movie a true classic in the comedy field.I think you should definitely rent it if nothing else.Totally worth a watch.Oh and Timothy Olyphant is Hilarious as Kelly.He should win an Oscar for his performance.",,Anonymous,Romance
Pretty good comedy with very good and subtle commentary.,Overall the movie is really funny and the cast is great. If you're a fan of comedies like this you should definitely give it a watch. It also gives a very good take on how manipulative and predatory the people who work in the pornography industry are. A good cautionary message hidden in. I would def give it a watch if you're eyeing it.,7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Borders on exceeding expectations,"When a teen comedy is released, everyone knows just about what to expect. There'll be a unpopular high school student (""Van Wilder"" chose the maverick route and made him popular) who suffers from either sexual or emotional problems, there'll be a group of flawed but nonetheless faithful friends to help them out and there'll be a hot girl who takes inexplicable interest in Unpopular Student. There'll be a message, a moral, a contemporary soundtrack and a lot of sex. Such were everyone's expectations for ""The Girl Next Door"" Luke Greenfield's 2004 contribution to the genre, starring Elisha Cuthbert and Emile Hirsch, the advertising emphasis on the former.Matthew Kidman (Hirsch) is a slightly repressed, highly unfulfilled near-graduate who aspires to win a scholarship to Georgetown on the basis of Moral Fiber. His dissatisfaction with overall life stems from his seeming incapacity to take a risk, to do something spontaneous and wild. Enter Danielle (Cuthbert), the gorgeous, free-spirited young niece of Matthew's next door neighbor, who is house-sitting for a few weeks. Immediately Matthew falls in love, and it would seem that the attraction is at least semi-reciprocated; for once he is feeling really, truly good about his life. What tips the film over from romantic comedy to teen comedy is not the presence of teenage characters, but the point when Matthew learns the perfect Girl Next Door is a porn-star.If the premise sounds 'typically teen' and derivative of the much more successful 80's flick ""Risky Business"", then that's because it is, on both counts. However, as much as I'd like to dismiss this as yet another thoroughly forgettable, sexploitative perpetuation of a film-genre that hasn't been truly inspired in 20 years, something holds me back. There's a touch of admirableness to this film, a hint of maturity, a vague, familiar scent of a movie that wants to say something, that had more in mind than an admittedly beautiful girl taking her clothes off. The real problem is that, as sweet as the message of love clearly is, the film is just too inconsistent. One moment it's making an almost pertinent point, the next it's having a go at teenage virgins. One moment it's witty, the next it's vulgar. One moment it's smart, the next it's stupid.It's this kind of inconsistency that gives you the feeling that the film-makers had a half-decent idea in their hands, but were, like their lead protagonist Matthew, afraid to take a risk. They border on breaking the mold at some points, but then they lose their nerve and retreat back into familiar but tired cliché. For instance, the opening 45 minutes or so of ""The Girl Next Door"" had me thinking I'd pegged this movie all wrong, even after the revelation of Danielle's profession. The whole thing was handled with astounding maturity, considering what kind of film we're dealing with. ""How do you want me?"" Danielle asks seductively of Matthew as she lies topless on the motel bed, aware now of his confused motives. The scene plays with unbelievable ridiculousness that even the fans would have to acknowledge, until Matthew comes through and speaks on behalf of the audience; ""Why are you doing this?"" Danielle then starts to show the kind of emotional damage we would realistically respect from her; ""Isn't this what you want? To f*ck a porn-star in a cheap motel?"" Hurt, she leaves Matthew to think about his careless actions, in turn leaving us thinking this bears startling resemblance to something that could actually happen in real life.Unfortunately, this feeling doesn't last long. Strangely it is the entrance of the film's show-stealer, Timothy Olyphant, which marks the beginning of the film's decline. Olyphant's character Kelly, Danielle's former producer and charismatic sleaze is superbly acted and written, but seems like he's gate-crashing a film he doesn't really belong in. Ensuing his arrival are the much less interesting and involving (if, granted, rather humorous) aspects of the film: Danielle leaves peaceful suburbia with Kelly to resume her life of degradation, Matthew sacrifices his grades and potential scholarship to attend the Adult Film Convention to bring her back, and ends up bloodied, wanted by authorities and high on ecstasy; a state in which he must give a speech to a hall full of people on why he must get a scholarship for Moral Fiber. And of course, in true romantic comedy tradition, the speech is completely improvised, all about Danielle (who has returned out of true love) and receives heart-felt applause. The only typical cliché that wasn't used was to end the film there; it's just too bad that what followed was ridiculous, tedious and dragged on for far too long.So I suppose you could say I'm in two minds about it. In a way, the film for me was a bit of a catch 22; all the faults would not have stood out or mattered nearly as much if it hadn't opted to show potential to be a much better, more interesting movie. On the other hand, the pleasant surprises it had to offer were, along with Timothy Olyphant, by far the best things about it. I guess what it all boils down to though is this; ""The Girl Next Door"" was not a film I expect to have strong opinions about. And it sure showed me.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Not a teen comedy. It's much more than that!,"I don't like the way this movie was marketed as if it is a teen comedy. YES it has the jocks and the losers but I wouldn't class this as a teen comedy at all. It's so much deeper and really much more of a love story / adventure because that's what happens.The first 1/4 is pretty much your average Teen comedy and was mostly what you saw in the trailers. Hard working kid with no time for fun meets hot girl next door who just happen's to be a porn star with his loser mates talking about ""banging"" hot chicks and not getting any. Thats the plot overall but that doesn't make an enjoyable movie in my eyes. In fact I only watched this when a friend had it on DVD and let me borrow it. I didn't exactly go out my way to watch this. Now it's one of my favourite films.This is because of where the film takes you and how much you can relate to what's happening. How many of you have felt your working to hard when you're young and not having much fun? How many of you have seen the perfect girl and wanted her so bad you'd do the craziest stuff? Half the ""stuff"" that happens through the film (especially the ending) you wouldn't have predicted from watching the first 1/4 and I want to tell you all the ""stuff"" but that would really spoil the first viewing (there will be more).The film is almost perfectly made, the kids are all excellent and the two stars have sparks practically flying off them when they are together. The music is spot on and the twists and turns will take your emotions on a roller-coaster ride.This film is perfect for watching alone, with friends or with your girlfriend because its ""feel-good"", ""funny"" and really ""deep"" and really deserves better credit as it's more than just an above average teen comedy. It fully deserves your attention.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Unoriginal rehash of old Cruise pimpdom,"The film industry can't quite figure out how to appropriate old TC movies for the next generation, so this is it...all the triteness reconfigured with a new and better soundtrack, and the hooker with a heart of gold storyline. The young leads, Emil Hirsh and Elisha Cuthbert are in the same roles as Cruise and DeMornay, but with far less acting talent but same amount of puppy fat. Geeks, footballers, and porn stars at the prom recreate the night to ""walk like a man"" but without the originality. In the crazed pimp-psycho role first created by the excellent Joey Pan, is HBO's Deadwood hotter than hot sheriff-good guy, Timothy Olyphant, in the role of a looser porn promoter. He brings the only chops to this otherwise been there, done that premise.This snooze fest is so cliché ridden that the ending is worse than predictable, its yuppie-puppie-spawn spew.

I was having a bad day and then I watched it and it definitely made me happy. I feel like they don't make movies like these today... The movie is actually good because they did not present the idea in a cheap or predictable way.Reading the old reviews here makes it even better, it makes me think of 2004 when the movie came out and people were exited to write about it here, I bet they did not think that someone would write smth abt the same movie later after 19 years.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

I've not done that with any other movie. Oh, and if you're a guy and have never seen Elisha before (not in this way anyway) she'll most likely take over your mind for the next few weeks.

good movie done in risky context,"I thought that this movie was going to be foolish but not all that bad... I was wrong and i was right... The movie was foolish in some respects, but it is a comedy and a sort of teen flick in the fact that these are teens (it wouldn't have worked very well with just adults anyway). I must say that the foolishness is done well in that it wasn't out of placeI believe the director and writers snuck a real movie in there somewhere.. This movie game me the feeling I got when I watched ""almost famous"" for the first time... It's no where near the caliber of that film but it does a good job of mixing those elements with the elements of a basic teen comedy. This is a story of finding your self in life as in 'Almost Famous'I liked that it did the bully thing but it was not with the expected jocks that are always the bully and you did not see the characters back down so quickly only to muscle enough strength later...

Not your typical teen Rom-com,"A good movie leaves you entertained and satisfied for the time you invested watching it, a great movie does more & leaves you thinking about it long after you watched it. If you are looking for young Rom-Com, then this is should be somewhere near the top of the list, there isn't much of teeny-silliness in it, which makes this good for audiences of all ages.At the face of it, it seems like a typical watch and forget teen/college Rom-Com but theres more & enough of it to keep your entertained from start to finish. All in all its a sweet romance movie which starts off along very predictable plot path but soon leaves with enough drama & so many twists and funny moments that it doesn't disappoint !The whole of the main cast did justice to their characters, the fact that most of the main actors/actress went on to become successful in careers is because of their performances in their early movies like this one.The soundtrack from David gray and moments it comes on in the movie is absolutely fitting and superb.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

I like how all the characters are portrayed and in all honestly I think the film probably reaches its potential here and is as good as it can be for this story.

Idiotic movie for idiots,"I have to admit, when I finished watching this, I was not entirely sure if I had seen a good or a bad movie. I thought maybe the incoherent, surreal, nonsensical lack of a story was intentional, that maybe this was multilayered and deep and I missed the symbolism or something. I thought about it for a good, long, hard 10 seconds, then decided that no, it was just trash. I mean, sometimes it can take hard work to make a movie this weird, but I'm pretty sure this was by accident.Let me put it to you this way: if you were amused by the phrase ""long, hard 10 seconds"" in the above paragraph, you will think this movie is a classic. Actually, no, you probably won't. You will be disappointed because there is no nudity. That's right: a movie about porn stars and the porn industry, and that condones porn as a good thing, has NO NUDITY. What the hell kind of message is THAT sending? I'm not even going to bother explaining the plot, because there is none. There's about a thousand different climaxes (haha, I said climaxes), and the movie contradicts its own attitude toward porn even more times than that. If you can make sense out of this mess, consider yourself a genius (or an idiot. I'm not sure).Other users have mentioned the movie's depiction of Asians is ""borderline racist."" I think the word they're looking for is ""downright,"" not borderline. Here's a true story: when I was 12, I started taking a tally on how many American comedies attempt to get laughs out of minorities swearing in goofy accents. Including this movie, that number has now surpassed 5 trillion (and the only time it has ever been funny was in ""Office Space""). Anyway, if you think an Asian kid wearing huge glasses and talking like Elmer Fudd is high comedy, this is the movie for you. If, however, you are not a racist dumbass, you'll want to avoid ""The Girl Next Door,"" and stick to something a little more watchable, like ""Manos: Hands of Fate.""",1.0,Anonymous,Romance

It's sweet and makes the movie memorable. It makes for a great love story. Emile's character, Matthew, is played thoughtfully. Elisha couldn't be better cast. The emotion in her expressions is perfect. Timothy Olyphant plays his character perfectly, he's a bad guy with a heart, if that makes sense. You want to hate him, you want to love him. This part is made for him. Matthew's best friends stand by him and are there for him through thick and thin. Acting is on point with all of the characters.It's one of my favorite movies. Do yourself a favor and watch this underrated movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
High School Genre Film Worth Seeing,"The Girl Next Door is a perfect example of the lack of perception that movie studios sometimes operate with. When test screenings reportedly went through the roof, Fox knew it had a potential hit on its hands, and set out to market the hell out of it. It was important, though, how they marketed it--because though GND is a successful high school teen comedy, it's not necessarily a sex comedy. The trailer for the movie wants to promote a cross between Risky Business and American Pie, with a dash of porn tossed in, and so the advertising pushes the sex aspect, even though it's NOT what the movie's about.The Girl Next Door begins by evoking the feeling of dread that 99% of us get as we wind into the spring of senior year--that taste of emptiness that starts to fill the place in our minds we'd been saving for the kind of nostalgic memories that you write about in your last yearbook. Emile Hirsch is Matthew Kidman, dealing with this same problem as a potential Georgetown attendee with political aspirations who feels like he's missed out. And he pulls it off. He's neurotic, repressed, frustrated and scared all at once.And then Elisha Cuthbert moves into the neighborhood to shake things up.Cuthbert is Danielle, the ex-porn star with a heart of gold who's looking for a fresh start. Naturally, Matthew and Danielle hit it off; she shows him how to have all the fun he's been missing, and he gives her the confidence and courage to believe in starting over. Naturally, problems ensue when Matthew's academics begin to disintegrate.Timothy Olyphant plays scene stealer as Danielle's porn agent, and Chris Marquette and Paul Dano fill out what could have been hollow supporting roles as Hirsch's buddies to give the movie a deeper overall feel. While the spin on Risky Business is obvious and moments of sentimentalism and ludicrousness make you groan at times, it's always compensated for and ultimately overpowered by the movie's acute sense of pathos--it knows what should be endearing and what should be funny about a coming of age experience that features a porn star (i.e. three high school kids at a convention for the adult film industry in Vegas).As a comedy, The Girl Next Door is funnier than most anything out so far this year (save Kaufman's Eternal Sunshine). In terms of box office, the problem maybe seems to stem from the fact that Cuthbert's star was skyrocketing before the movie was ever in theaters, compelling Fox's marketing department to push the focus in the wrong direction. But the bottom line is that this movie is the first quality teen comedy to dramatize end-of-high-school anxiety since Ferris Bueller's Day Off. And if you think about it, Cuthbert's character is no more ridiculous than Ferris. (Seriously, did you ever know someone that EVERYONE liked in high school, who could get away with anything? Me either.) Go see this movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Dumb and dumber,"Caught a preview screening of this flick which is essentially just a stale ""Risky Business""-wannabe with dumber jokes.  Lovely Elisha Cuthbert makes this almost watchable, but the lazy writing and tepid direction undermine the game cast.  As the previous reviewer noted, the film's attitude toward Asians is borderline racist (way to alienate a section of your audience, dude!).  This is thin, unoriginal boxoffice fodder aimed at undemanding teens and horny middle-aged losers (which means it will probably be a huge hit).

"Could have been great...But not bad, either","First, let's get this out of the way...Elisa Cuthbert is absolutely gorgeous. So on those merits alone, the movie can't be half bad. And actually it's not. Though it never reaches the lofty heights of the film it wants so badly to emulate, (Risky Business)it is a fairly enjoyable ride for about 2 hours. Early on the film has the feel of those great 80's teen sex movies and even uses traces of the Risky Business score. And even though the film does go off course a little towards the end, I can't help but appreciate the cast throughout. I do think that Elisa Cuthbert's character could have been fleshed out (pardon the pun) a little better. She was a character that was utterly engrossing and I wanted to learn more about her. But anyway, though not a great film by any means, the Girl Next Door is worth a look.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

But, unlike others I rewatch nearly every year, I always appreciate this particular one for its quality as well as its meaning to myself. It's quite a well crafted, fun movie with memorable characters and a depth that is a bit greater than you'll find in most teen comedies. Don't let that fool you, though. It's also one of the funnier examples of the genre that understands the underlying strength of any good joke: timing.Overall it is a little gem a movie and I highly recommend it to anyone who likes to enjoy a proper teen comedy once in a while.

Pornography - still the saviour of high school kids,"Being a big horror fan, I spend a lot of my time watching what you might call 'wayward cinema' but, believe it or not, even the very worst of those films pale in comparison to this little teen flick when it comes to misplaced morality. Here, we have a film that not only shows high school kids in the middle of the porn industry, popping ecstasy pills, stealing things and just generally sticking two fingers up where the law is concerned; but it shows them doing this in a positive light, with a great big smile on it's face! However, I'm not one to complain about such things and, again; believe it or not - this is actually a damn good film! The skewed morality can be off-putting, but it's fairly obvious that this film is meant to be more of a spoof than a serious coming of age tale; so it's better to simply go with it rather than worry too much. The film is in the vein of American Pie, and it follows a young man who is lucky enough to have a porn star move in next door to him. After being caught spying on her undressing, she takes him for a ride and, as you might expect, the two hit it off instantly. However, being a porn star has it's drawbacks, and hers comes in the form of a nasty manager by the name of Kelly.The plot of The Girl Next Door is entirely predictable, but there's always enough side stories and gags to ensure that the action always remains interesting. The film is never side-splittingly hilarious, but some of the sight gags are genuinely funny. Jokes involving a lap dance, and another that sees two high school kids pretending to be porn directors are the best among them. The soundtrack features a lot of good songs, but it can be annoying when they're being played over nearly every scene. One thing that worried me before seeing this film was Elisha Cuthbert. Like most people, I've been used to seeing her in the best American TV show of all time, 24, and didn't think that she'd be able to pull off the role of pornstar. She's a good-looking actress; but I wouldn't consider her to be 'sexy'. However, surprisingly enough she does really well in the role. Her co-star, Emile Hirsch, looks about ten; but he does a good job of getting the audience on his side, so even though it's impossible to believe that a sexy pornstar would go for him; he doesn't ruin the movie. On the whole, while this isn't anything like a great movie; it's a more than solid entry in the teen comedy sub-genre, and if you want a movie that will entertain for a couple of hours with caring about political correctness - this one should do it.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Don't waste your time,"A porn star moves next door to a high school nerd. The story practically writes itself as the hilarity ensues. Unfortunately, the exact opposite happens.

The scenes are also mostly realistic but sometimes somewhat unrealistic..

Your inconsistency is showing,"I had to contemplate long and hard what grade I would give this movie. It was teetering on the edge of recommendation, when ultimately, a few little things docked it down to a state where I can't really recommend it. With that being said, I will say that The Girl Next Door did however keep me entertained for all one hundred and ten minutes because of its very vibrant casting and quite a few jokes that were actually funny that weren't seen in the trailer.Speaking of the trailer, it is another film that pretty much covers up parts of the plot to draw more of an audience. The same thing happened in the trailer for Dream a Little Dream where the big part about the body swapping element was left without a mention. In the trailer for this film, it tries to make this look like a teen comedy following in the footsteps of the American Pie franchise. When really, it is more of an adult raunchy comedy.The plot: Matthew (Hirsch) is a high school Senoir stressing over his big speech he is set to give on the topic ""moral fiber,"" which may get him a scholarship to the prestigious Georgetown University. Looking back on his High School experience when asked what he'll remember, Matthew tries hard to recollect what he will remember but can't find anything.Matthew is in luck because he gets a new neighbor. Her name is Danielle (Cuthbert) and she is probably every guy's masturbatory fantasy come true. Matthew is in his room and notices her changing clothes and can't help but stare. Seeing him, Danielle comes over to introduce herself of all things instead of tell Matt's parents he was snooping.They hang out frequently, developing an awkward yet likable friendship until Matt's friend Eli (Marquette) informs him that she was a porn star under the stage name ""Athena."" Matt is shocked, and in disbelief, and soon enough, he meets the cut throat producer of Danielle's named Kelly (Olyphant) who means business. Kelly and Matt form a very unsettling relationship, and his life begins to spiral out of control between the love of his life and the consequences.The story does have a good motto and moral that is probably one of my favorites next to the meaningful bit in Harold and Kumar Go to White Castle. In that film, a guy in prison tells Harold that ""there is no sense getting all riled up every time a bunch of idiots give you a hard time, (because) the universe tends to unfold as it should."" In this, Kelly firmly tells Matthew to ask himself ""is the juice worth the squeeze?"" meaning is Danielle worth the possible consequences. Because of what Matthew tells Danielle in the movie at an adult convention, she declines Kelly's offer and goes back home.While bringing good actors and a good motto into the light, the film also has a number of inconsistencies that I found. One of them is age seems to mean nothing in this film. There's one scene where Kelly and Danielle take Matt to a strip club. Keep in mind, Matthew is in high school and is no older than eighteen or nineteen. How did he manage to get into the strip club? Same thing with the adult convention. How did the three friends get into the convention when they're only Senoirs in high school? Also, why is Danielle going to an adult convention as ""Athena"" when she is a ""former"" porn star? Wouldn't that mean she quit doing it, and usually when you quit something, you don't make public appearances as the job you quit. In order for this movie to exist, many things also can't. Like age and occupation rules.Those things really drag the film down, along with the fact the film does nothing but glorify the world of porn. Not one women in this film, except for Matt's mom (Bullock), is not put in this film to show of their body. I find it a little odd that we see such a world of porn stars and personality lacking women in a film that tries to have a strong motto. While the film packs on a good motto, it doesn't do much to eliminate stereotypes.But for some reason, this film still stood out to me for the music, the performances, and the overall feel. Obviously, the poster child for this type of genre is Risky Business. If I would've seen the full movie, I probably would've found this less in quality. But standing on its own, it really does get laughs despite a few inexcusable inconsistencies. It's a respectable, yet not strong enough Hollywood debut by actor Emile Hirsch, who I still believe will go on and do some brilliant things in his lifetime.Starring: Emile Hirsch, Elisha Cuthbert, Timothy Olyphant, Paul Dano, Chris Marquette, Timothy Bottoms, and Donna Bullock. Directed by: Luke Greenfield.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
For entertainment purposes only,"The Girl Next Door is one of the most unrealistic movies I've ever seen. It's less realistic than The Exorcist and it makes less sense than Yellow Submarine. Once I got past that though - and it took some effort - and tried to enjoy it for what it is, I found out it's not a bad movie, either.Even when it tries to pretend to have a message or a point, and it unfortunately does, The Girl Next Door should be taken for entertainment purposes only, and as such, it's pretty entertaining. It's never laugh out loud funny, but it has some humorous moments, some good acting (no, not Elisha Cuthbert... but Tim Olyphant is great, and young Emile Hirsch already shows some talent) and surprisingly, the humor is much less broad and crude than most other teen comedies of its time. In fact, The Girl Next Door, shockingly, is almost family friendly, and its overall attitude is more positive and idealistic than you would possibly imagine. Not that anyone would want to watch it with their family, mind you. The movie has a pretty limited appeal - it probably won't be that attractive to anyone but the 15-21 year old male demographic. But you shouldn't be concerned if your kids watch this, either. The Girl Next Door is one of the more conservative, cheerful, feel good comedies of the 00's.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
The most underrated movie in history.,"If you liked Risky Business and you have a love of teen comedy, then this is the perfect movie for you. Well written and almost perfectly acted. The plot is cute and entertaining and all the set ups pay off very well, not to mention that Elisha Cuthbert has never been hotter (and probably never will be again). This movie puts a new spin on romantic comedy while keeping the audience's attention through many suspenseful subplots. If you don't expect much, this film will blow you away. If you go in thinking it's one of the best teen romantic comedies out there, you'll still end up happy. Rent it, buy it, worship it....at least buy it.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Next Years Oscars, I Think not","So this was yet another teen movie, but based on an adult theme,  I for one laughed out loud the whole time, I may have a mind of a 15 year old (I'm 35) so it was a very enjoyable experience.Ok so the acting and the story was not Oscar class, but it took up 112 minutes of my time and filled them very well.Not all movies are supposed to be serious and art, this was just what it set out to be, a good laugh and very entertaining.I give this film 10/10 for just being so funny, I know its no Shawshank, Godfather, Empire Strikes Back or Matrix, but it really hit my spot",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

bad film about a geek and there is also a female porn star,"To make it short, this was the worst movie I've seen in a long time; very predictable, in the end the geek turned into the school hero and became a millionaire? Not to forget, there is also a porn star who becomes his girl-friend, triggered his changes or the other way around and in the second half is only there to be the good looking part. This movie has no charm as Pretty Woman, no cool dialogues as e.g. Kill Bill 2 (even though it tries-squeeze the juice?) and the love story is lame (why would the porn queen go for the school boy-does this really change her life to the better?).

Lots of Fun Film,"This was a great entertaining film with plenty of action and lots of laughs.

Elisha Cuthbert, ""House of Wax"", moves next door to Emile and gives him a free show of her body from her bedroom window and then proceeds to visit his home and asks for help getting to know the town and its hot spots.

Needed better writing,"While searching online, I often saw The Girl Next Door pop up on lists of the best R-rated teen comedies. I gave it a try, and I was disappointed. I didn't really feel like the movie was trying to be funny. The first half focuses on the romantic relationship between the main character, Matthew--who is a senior in high school--and the impossibly beautiful older woman who moves into the house facing his bedroom. She is instantly attracted only to him, and we get a romance that never feels the least big believable. While the woman, Danielle, is depicted as fun and spontaneous, we never see any reason why she (or anyone) would want to spend any time with Matthew. He is a total blank of a human being, and from the way he is written, I wouldn't expect him to even have friends who could put up with his dour, whiny behavior. He would be an extremely disappointing child for any parent to end up with. The second half of the movie marginalizes Danielle, the movie's best character, to focus on Matthew getting out of a series of sticky situations with her former manager, who is demanding payment for the loss of his client. None of these scenes are comedic, and they aren't satisfying to watch because Matthew isn't a character anyone could care about. You don't feel the success of him overcoming the obstacles because he is suddenly able to do things his character shouldn't be able to do. They made him seem completely helpless in the early scenes of the film, and never really showed him grow or change. They just gave him ingenuity and problem solving skills when he needed them through lazy writing. And again, none of it was funny. I did not care for that, and I do not recommend The Girl Next Door.",4.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Should be a lot better, but it's alright  (***)","This is one of those times that the 3-star rating is mainly a sentimental one. There are many moments in ""The Girl Next Door"", mainly in its first half, that capture that awesome 80's-ness of the best teen comedies of the 80's, but at the same time it's not nearly as good as it should (and easily could) be.Obviously heavily inspired by the 1983 Tom Cruise teen classic ""Risky Business"" (even the score mimics the ""Risky Business"" score at key moments), it's about an ambitious but indifferent high school senior named Matthew (Emile Hirsch, ""The Dangerous Lives Of Altar Boys"") whose comfortable world is thrown into disarray when the stunningly beautiful Danielle (Elisha Cuthbert, from TV's ""24"") moves in next door.They strike up a relationship the kind of way that you only see in the movies, but it's very entertaining (and like ""Risky Business"", it's more about teenage wish-fulfillment than reality), so I didn't mind. Then things get complicated when Matt learns, through his porn-addicted friend Eli (the hilarious Chris Marquette), that Danielle is a porn star.In the first half, ""The Girl Next Door"" is a lot of fun. It's well-paced, interesting, funny, and the soundtrack keeps throwing great songs at you. Unfortunately, the second half is dragged down quite a bit by the unnecessary addition of several non-entertaining subplots and characters that distract from what the movie should be about: Matthew's sexual awakening.Still, even though I almost stuck it with a **1/2, there are just enough good scenes and great songs to get a somewhat-shaky but solid recommendation from me. After all, any movie that makes good use of ""Under Pressure"" by Queen and David Bowie AND The Who's ""Baba O'Riley"" (two of my all-time favorite songs) will probably get my vote.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
The Girl Nexxxt Door.,"If you've seen the 1983 Tom Cruise sex comedy Risky Business, then you'll no doubt get a strong sense of deja-vu whilst watching The Girl Next Door, for the plot is almost identical, albeit slightly tweaked in places and updated for today's audiences: where Tom Cruise's preppy Joel Goodsen fell in love with a hot hooker, Emile Hirsch's Matthew Kidman hooks up with hot porn star Danielle (Elisha Cuthbert); Risky Business's sleazy antagonist, Guido the killer pimp, becomes adult film producer Kelly (Timothy Olyphant); instead of having the contents of his parents house stolen, Matthew loses a $25,000 fund for foreign student Samnang; and rather than running a brothel to recoup his losses, Matthew and his geeky pals decide to use their new contacts in the adult film biz to turn their luck around.However, despite screaming 'rip-off' at every turn, it's very hard not to enjoy this film. Director Luke Greenfield handles his material well and the appealing cast all do a great job: Hirsch is perfect as uptight Matthew who eventually learns to cut loose (to paraphrase Joel Goodsen, 'Sometimes you just gotta say 'What the fk!!'); Elisha Cuthbert is absolutely drop-dead gorgeous and oozes sensuality (although she doesn't get nekkid, which is a real shame!); Olyphant is brilliant as he effortlessly switches between charming rogue and utterly menacing villain; and Chris Marquette impresses as Matthew's film-student pal Eli (is it just me, or is this guy a dead ringer for a young John Cusack?).The Girl Next Door does suffer a little during it's more emotional scenes, which lack conviction, but these less effective moments are easily counterbalanced by the film's genuinely funny moments that capitalise well on the film's lewd premise, including Matthew imagining Danielle getting it on with his parents, a fracas at an adult film convention in Las Vegas, and Matthew's run in with a friend of the family at a lap-dancing club.Although The Girl Next Door is far from original, and never reaches the levels of perfection achieved by Cruise and Co. (let's face it, Risky Business is a classic of the genre and a very hard act to follow), it passes the time well enough, offering some quality eye candy for us blokes, a bit of mushy, sentimental, lovey-dovey pap for the ladies, a decent pop/rock soundtrack, and a heartwarming outcome for all of its characters.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

"Weird, fun yet uneven","With all the good intentions this movie may have been made with (a story about growing up, save sex, friendship and the likes), it will probably be remembered most as the movie in which Elisha Cuthbert as Danielle is showing of an awful lot of skin. Not that I, or most of the (male) audience, mind, that is.And it's the filmmaker's own fault the movie is looked upon that way. It starts out with young and inexperienced Matthew (Emile Kidman) peeping at his new nextdoorgirl while undressing. He's attracted to her (hmm, yes what teenage guy wouldn't...) and from that moment on she takes him out to make him feel more secure about himself. When they arrive at a party Matthew just feels he should do something, and there's a wonderful scene in which he just steps over his shyness to kiss her, while David Gray is singing his breathtaking This Years Love. Beautiful scene, very recognizable.But then the movie flies all over the place again, with porn, a political speech, a golden penis, violence and drugs all taking its place. No, seriously.This all makes up for an uneven film, in which the falling in love scenes between Matthew and Danielle, how unlikely they may be, make up for the best scenes of the film. They even got David Gray to sing his song for a second time! But on the other hand the movie is messy and too hard tries to fit in a happy ending.Too bad as The Girl Next Door sure has some things to offer. 6/10.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Funny movie,"This movie is so funny. It demonstrated a teenager's loving story with two cute actor/actress.Elisha Cuthbert is the most gorgeous actress I have ever been seen in my life. I cannot imagine such a beautiful would be a porn star. Anybody tell me why she is so hot? Definitely, Elisha did the good thing, without being naked in the play, just a lot of pictures making you assume she is naked. Kelly, Danielle's ex-boyfriend, is so atrocious, but another porn producer, Hugo, is more powerful than him. I think the only shortcoming of the movie is that it is not necessary to bring up a story about raising money for a Cambodian student to study in America, any other plot would have been better, I mean it is not understandable. Of course the director may have his own opinion. By the way, some pictures in the movie are kind of offensive such as those having sex in tape, it is not essential for the movie, I think.Another two friends of Matt are also had a great performance in the movie, this movie reminds me of what I looked like as high school student, doing whatever you want without thinking about the consequence and risk it at all.

What I got was a movie that has depth and still retains its comedic edge. Elisha Cuthbert and Emile Hirsch are excellent together. Elisha Cuthbert does something I haven't seen for a while out of an actress: she acts with her eyes first, then the rest of her follows. Like the DVD extras said Emile Hirsch does this as well, but Elisha is definitely more adept at this. She is a very underrated actress, probably because she's gorgeous to such a great degree. I hope to see more of her in movie roles that don't concentrate so much on how good she looks.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

The juice is worth the squeeze!,"...to answer a repeated question in the movie.The critics don't like this, but the moviegoers do.  OK it's not exactly Shakespeare or Ibsen, but it is an enjoyable night out.Elisha Cuthbert (woefully underused in 24) gets her chance to shine and is fantastic.  Drop-dead gorgeous and she can act as well.  It's a shame that for a 15 (in the UK)-rated movie we get to see so little of her amazing body.The story is fairly predictable, although the director does try to fool us now and again by including the odd scenes that turn out to be a dream or fantasy.  There is an occasional flash of violence that seems a little out of place but otherwise it's all good fun, albeit a little raunchy for the more conservatively-minded.The story reminded me just a little of 1968's The Graduate, and the excellent soundtrack ranges back to the 60s with Donovan and Thunderclap Newman, and right up to today with David Gray.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Great teenage comedy.,"This is a sweet romantic teenage comedy that is better than you might expect it to be. It has an intelligent story with some great characters and a believable well constructed love-story. High-school and ex high-school students should be able to recognize a lot in the movie its story and characters.The movie delivers on several levels. As a comedy this movie is fun and certainly entertaining, mainly thanks to the well casted actors. Especially Timothy Olyphant is truly great and enjoyable in his 'villainish' porn producer role. Also as a romantic movie, this movie is a really successful one. The love-story is good and mainly, also very original. Basically this movie is a pleasure to watch, from start to finish.The story has some great turns in twists in it and you never know what is going to happen next. It tries to avoid as many teenage movie cliché's as possible but still unfortunately falls in some traps at times. Still the movie is way better than most other teenage comedies currently being made and some that were made in the '80's, which was the golden age of teenage comedies. This is due to the well written story and characters and the actors that portray them.The movie is fun and at times also hilarious. It's a very entertaining movie to watch for all ages but mainly for teenagers of course who should be able to recognize some of the elements in this movie. The movie also has some great use of some great music.8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Better than expected,"Matthew Kidman is a nerdy, insular 18-year-old who's lived a fairly sheltered, risk averse life. When a stunningly beautiful girl, Danielle, moves in next door, to his surprise, they hit it off. Things are progressing well but hanging onto her could be problematic. Then Matthew discovers a deep dark secret about Danielle, a secret that tests their relationship.A pleasantly surprising romantic comedy. It looks like a typical nerd meets ""beautiful woman well out of his league and somehow they fall in love"" type film. Admittedly, that is the core of the film but it's better than that.

The acting is superb from all, you can really see the two characters in love at the start and end of the film. I'm not big on this genre but I loved this film.

A poor man's Risky Business for Generation Y,"We just saw a sneak preview of this movie, which is due to be released in mid-March.A shy idealistic young man named Matthew (Emile Hirsch), who gets into Georgetown about a month before graduating from high school, is nonetheless suffering from the lack of excitement in his life.  All that will change when he gets caught sneaking a pick at his sultry next-door neighbor Danielle (Elisha Cuthbert), who just happens to be a porn star trying to quit the business.  They quickly fall in love and Danielle takes Matthew for a wild ride that teaches him  that ""sometimes you just got to say what the f**k!""This is clearly a rather poor remake of the 1983 picture Risky Business, which featured Tom Cruise and very young and breathtaking Rebecca De Mornay. This new version does not stand up to Risky Business in terms of either the story or cinematography and Elisha Cuthbert is no match for Rebecca De Mornay.  Where De Mornay's character was sexy, sophisticated, and real, Cuthbert's character does not extend much beyond her good looks.  At times, I was made with the director of this movie for trying to remake a very good movie and screwing up royally.  The scene between Matthew and Danielle in the limo (a cheap and uninspired knockoff of the De Mornay-Cruise scene in the Chicago subway) was just atrocious.To be fair, this movie has a few very funny moments, and the actors playing Kelly (Danielle's producer) and Eli (Matthew's friend Eli) did a great job.

Is Juice worth the squeeze?.......Absolutely,"Elisha Cuthbert is, without a doubt, the most beautiful woman I have ever seen. To be honest, before I saw this film I had only seen her briefly in Love Actually but as her name appeared in the programme synopsis on Sky I decided it was worth a look.From the first time you see her she seems to express herself in such a natural way. The look on her face throughout the movie and in some scenes especially is so sincere she really brings the emotion of her character and the connection she has to Matthew to life.I know I am not saying much about the film which, in itself, I thought was good but the main reason to watch this film is to see what an amazing talent Elisha Cuthbert is. I hesitate to use the word 'actor' as her character is so natural I get the feeling she is just being herself. These days, actors are so full of themselves it's hard to tell where one stops and another starts. Elisha Cuthbert, on the other hand, is in a league of her own and I have a feeling as her success gets even greater that she will retain this quality by just keep on being herself.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

Surprisingly Old Fashioned...,"The recent glut of 90's gross out teen movies has just received another member into its fold. However, while the likes of Road Trip and American Pie may be welcomed with open arms and encouraging pats on the back, The Girl Next Door is more likely to be greeted with a non committal handshake and a couple of suspicious sideways glances. You see, this movie, despite its flaws (and there are plenty) manages to possess something that so many similar films lack. Namely? A heart.I will admit to not being averse to a bit of gross out humour. While such gags as those in the American Pie movies are hardly high art, they at least draw a belly laugh from the audience now and then. I went in to The Girl Next Door with the opinion that this was going to be another attempt by Hollywood to follow the now successful American Pie recipe. Throw a bunch of attractive twenty something's into a film to play characters up to ten years their juniors, add a couple of party scenes, a vaguely pop/rock soundtrack and plenty of bodily fluids. Leave to bake until a nice golden brown before serving to the viewing public.Imagine my surprise then, when I found The Girl Next Door to be more akin to some of the classic teen movies of the 1980's, in particular the early Tom Cruise vehicle Risky Business. While it never quite reaches the balance or sharpness of some of those films, it nevertheless manages to stand aloof from its more modern brethren, and dare I say it, perhaps a touch higher as well.Young Matthew Kidman (played by Emile Hirsch) is coming to the end of his High School life. He's a straight A student who aims to succeed in everything he does. Needless to say, he has also kept to the straight and narrow, and now that his High School days are coming to a close he's beginning to feel that he may have missed out on the wilder side of his youth. All this will change however when the gorgeous Danielle begins house sitting next door (24's Elisha Cuthbert). The pair spark up a relationship as the more confident and free spirited Danielle tries to help Matthew discover what he's been missing out on all these years.It is in this early portion of the film that The Girl Next Door most resembles some of its classic predecessors. The cast mesh exceedingly well together, Hirsch and Cuthbert providing stand out performances that really elevate the movie beyond its somewhat mundane early premise. Hirsch's Matthew is a wonderfully balanced character who is both intelligent, and yet occasionally astonishingly naïve. It also makes a nice change that despite his relatively buttoned down lifestyle, Matthew can hardly be described as a geek. Cuthbert puts in a wonderful turn as Danielle providing the character with a more down to earth feel than many of the similar characters in other movies, and succeeds in making the audience understand why Matthew falls for her the way he does. Also of note is Chris Marquette as Matthew's terminally horny and pornography obsessed friend Eli.It's hardly hiding any major plot twist to say that Danielle is somewhat more than she first appears. Eli's viewing habits quickly uncover the fact that she is a porn star and it's with this revelation that the movie loses its way somewhat. The plot line becomes increasingly dense and convoluted as it tries to tie together numerous plot strands and only half succeeding. The introduction of Timothy Olyphant (best known as the drug dealer Tod from Go) as Danielle's producer and ex boyfriend Kelly also proves to be both a blessing and a curse. A blessing because Olyphant was born to play these kind of laid back, cool yet sleazy types, and effortlessly manages to steal every scene he's in, a curse for almost exactly the same reason. Kelly quickly becomes one of the movie's major driving forces and his efforts to keep the two apart practically supplant the increasingly awkward romance of Danielle and Matthew. The dramatic decrease in Cuthbert's actual screen time in the movies second act only serves to hammer this fact home. At roughly an hour and forty minutes, the film is also a little long. Comedies should never really run above an hour and a half, and this one could easily have been condensed if some of the extraneous plot elements had been dropped.However, despite struggling under its own weight in the second act, director Luke Greenfield manages to pull everything together for what is ultimately a fun and satisfying conclusion. The final twist to the story is wonderful and the last scenes manage to tread that oh so fine line between cool touching sentiment and cloying mushiness.The Girl Next door is ultimately a film that aspires to loftier goals than so many of its contemporaries. It strives to tug at your heart and truly make you feel for the characters involved. That it by and large succeeds in that goal is a testament to the movie. However the fact that it loses its bottle halfway through and throws in a series of unnecessary and often distracting plot lines to try and compensate for a deficiency that quite frankly didn't exist in the first place is all the more saddening.

simply brilliant,"with a great performance by all; this film, in my opinion, is simply the best of its genre.if u love it too; add me Elisha's performance along side Emile was great (they go together so well) characters seem free when togetherscrewthisplace@hotmail.comis Elisha anything like her character in 'the girl next door' in real life? looks like a really fun person to know.also Eli and Klits are a funny partnership (jousting scene is good) take my advice watch this film and if u don't like it you have bad taste and there is something wrong with you.despite the fact that people title this as a teen movie it is good for other ages and its humour is not slapstick, more slow, but you have to think about it( this does not stop it from being hilarious) Great soundtrack as well as good camera technique Elisha, why aren't you more famous in england",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Not what I expected,"When I saw the previews for this film I had to say I didn't expect much. When I saw it at a free screening last week in Seattle I was actually really happy I went. This film is amusing and funny. It reminded me of ""Risky Business"" with the taboo topic of sex with a porn star instead of a prostitute. Elisha Cuthbert is fantastic in this film and leaves quite an impression. This movie was hilarious and had a nice balance of high school humor and adult humor. I would definately go and see it again.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
If only every teen sex comedy were this way,"The art of making a teen sex comedy is usually associated with immaturity and gross-out tactics that for some reason make most people double over in laughter (prime example: American Pie's ""Pale Ale"" scene). While those tactics usually prove to be quite entertaining, The Girl Next Door puts it all to shame.The most noticeable difference between this movie and the dozens of others in its genre is the form of the laughs; plenty of them are crude, but they still retain good taste. A lot of the lines are just plain great, such as when Eli sits in the kids' Health class claiming, ""I could make a better sex ed video with my mom."" Even more can be said about the characters. Half the fun of this movie is seeing the different sides of these teenagers as they deal with their problems, and how they develop in doing so. Eli is a hilariously shy teen with hormones raging beyond belief; Klitz reminds you of every nerd you've ever seen, yet the irony is that he's the ballsiest of the bunch; and Matthew's start as a highly motivated, up-tight kid who's almost too smart for his own good makes for even more fun when he comes out of his shell and becomes a realistic, confident young man. The acting in all these roles is better than most would expect, and the fact that each of the actors are about 20 years old makes it seem much more real than films that used actors like Jason Biggs and Freddie Prinz, Jr. as high school students. Elisha Cuthbert's performance is especially good as the sexy title character, Danielle: she pulls the character's air of hidden innocence off with great skill.Behind all the great humor and characters, The Girl Next Door's story and direction are just plain terrific, and for once in a teen sex comedy, there is a presence of vision. The camera angles and editing are well-utilized to reflect the mood of each scene. The incredible soundtrack gives it another big boost, as every track seems like it was made exclusively for its scene, especially in the ending sequence with the use of the Who's Baba O'Riley.Though this film is near-perfect, it does leave you wishing for more. Even though it's all richly entertaining, you finish the movie wishing that it made you laugh more than it did. However, that is no reason to miss this masterpiece.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Hilarious, Dramatic, Sexy. Everything a movie needs.","The Girl Next Door is a great movie! I give it a 7 out of 10. Elisha Cuthbert is wonderful in this movie. She's sexy but not only that she plays out her role perfectly. I couldn't think of anyone better to play her. But I think of a couple people that I wouldn't mind seeing. :) You would think this movie is crap because a lot of the movies like this usually are. Well if you think it's then you are crap. This movie is addicting to watch. When you watch it you love the sex, the parties, the kisses, blah blah blah. Wrong! Maybe you do but it's the drama and the comedy that pulls you in.

Yes.... another teen movie.,"I don't know why I thought this would be a good movie, or at least a funny one. The history is the same old one, the characters too. I am not going to take the time to describe them... As in other movies once I realized that the movie sucked I kept watching it either because of the beauty of the character or because I had the foolish illusion that it would be turn into a good movie at the end. With this movie I couldn't even do that. Despite the beauty of 'Elisha Cuthbert' (Danielle) the movie didn't give me any glimpse or clue that would had a turn to a funny movie or at least 'interesting'... So after 25 minutes of horrible boredom and total disappointment I chose for skip big parts of the movie and went directly to the end.. the classical happy end. If I would have the choice now I won't see it at all! Not even in cable on a very boring Sunday afternoon.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance

Risky Business 2,"Good fun, 90's version of Risky Business.   Substituting 90's porn industry for 80's call girls.  But the seamy subject matter, isn't off putting, because the smart script offers life lessons and insight that is rare in today's teenage sex comedies.    Like Cruise's film, this movie is about a likeable high school dweeb who dreams about 2 things ; getting into a prestigious college, and hooking up with hot babes.  Using RB as a blueprint, the film's arc is familiar, but still vastly entertaining. Clever, funny dialogue, energetic performances, and real sweet chemistry between Elisha and newcomer Emile.  Does it need to be emphasized again about how stunningly gorgeous Ms Cuthbert is?  Wow.  I'm in love.  Movie even uses a couple of songs that were heard on Risky Business soundtrack. Enjoy.

"Poor plot, poor material, no laughs, forced titillation for boys and a crude air produce a film that will have almost no appeal outside of the male teen market","Matthew Kidman is a geek; school president, hangs out with other nerds and generally doesn't have any luck with the popular guys or the girls. He can't believe his luck when a gorgeous girl moves in next door and seems happy to hang out with him. His illusions are shattered when he learns that she is a porn star and, unsure of how to act, he ruins things between them. But both seem reluctant to truly break it off but can they work through their differences.Even though I like to think that I have good taste in films, I did see the trailer and thought 'hmmm, could be sexy and funny' and decided to give it a go on DVD. However if I'd known that it would really be neither then perhaps I wouldn't have bothered. The plot is pretty simplistic and is really the ultimate teenage boy fantasy, but it is this at the expense of the issues that could have been put into the film. Porn is a complex and nasty business and those involved in it can easily have difficult relationship and lives, however this film doesn't do anything with this aspect of the plot (apart from Matty wanting Danielle out of the business). The lowest point was a throwaway line that one of the porn stars had lost her virginity at age 10. Sorry, but the implication that a woman got into the sex industry of the back of sexual abuse as a child (and all that brings mentally and emotionally) is not a joking matter and I was stunned that nobody had the good taste to remove this line. Of course this is a comedy so I wouldn't expect it to do this because it would take away from the laughs but, with this film, the writers have already taken the laughs away and replaced with crude material and ineffective titillation.For teenage boys then I can imagine this mix will work but for me it just didn't tickle me at all. There were no real jokes here and, instead, there are just jocular references to porn mixed with scenes of 'hot girls', semi-nudity and the inevitable (and increasingly boring) girl/girl kissing. I had hoped that it would have a fun sexy air to it but it really didn't, instead it was ground in crudity and the obvious sexuality of porn. Of course some of it was still quite sexy but generally it was for teenagers more than anything else. Sadly this also took priority over the material and as a result the actual romance is flat and unconvincing  we are meant to buy Danielle changing her life for Matt but their relationship is so thin as to not exist  and playful flirting at the start just doesn't didn't do it for me.Like many others, part for my motivation for seeing this film was 24's Elisha Cuthbert, but I felt a bit bad for her as I thought she was basically exploited. With very little in the way of material to work with she is reduced to spending most of the first half of the film just being, well, sexy! At times she seems to be trying to bring out emotions and conflicts in her character and I thought 'she's got something here' but she was let down by a script that was more interested in where the next half-naked girl was coming from as opposed to the inner workings of the characters. Hirsch is likable but just to wishy washy for my liking, but again the plot gives him little to work with. The two characters that the film does have fun with are Kelly and Eli and the two actors both have fun as a result. Olyphant is fun but it is Marquette that steals all his scenes  admittedly he has little competition but still. He is lively and funny and the extras on the DVD's are best when he is in character at the Adult Film conference. Dano is OK but is an easy geek, while the rest of the cast just plays jocks etc. Remar makes a brief appearance surrounded by lovely ladies and there are plenty of them  something that will keep the teenage boys happy  but the rest of us will probably wonder why we didn't just watch porn!Overall this is a pretty poor film but it has just about enough energy to be watchable in you are in a very undemanding mood. There are no actual laughs to be had and the rest of the film just tries to keep providing titillation every few minutes to cover the total lack of material. The characters are flat, the relationships pathetically drawn and I had stopped caring about the story long before the end. I wouldn't watch it again and I would not recommend it to anyone over the age of 15 or female.",,Anonymous,Romance
Must Watch Teen Comedy Entertainer Movie,"This is certainly one of the best teen love stories I have seen. All the actors played parts beautifully, especially the protagonists, Hirsch, Cuthbert and Olyphant and the movie keeps you glued to your sit till the end.This is the story of matthew(Hirsch) who doesn't know how to have fun in his life. Matthew is the college president and is about to graduate and then 'she' enters his life and changes everything. Danielle(Cuthbert) moves in into the neighbourhood of Matthew and Matthew falls for her the moment he sees her. Then he finds out that Danielle is in fact a pornstar but he is so much in love with her that he does everything that he can to get her. Will he succeed? And if he does, at what cost?One of the weird things about this movie is that Cuthbert plays a pornstar and we don't even get to see her full frontal but her sheer beauty makes up for it to an extent. Another thing this movie failed to do was that it never digs into the past life of Danielle as to how and why did she became a pornstar.All in all, I think there are more pluses to this movie than minuses. If you like teen love stories then you'll surely like this one too.

A bit of a shock!,"Well I wasn't expecting this, but as a lead I will tell you that in my opinion this is fantastic. Before now the best teen type movie was ""Ferris Bueller's Day Off"". A great film because it went past the teen film genre and threw in an escalator of scenes that kept you held. Now this film does the same thing, but it adds twists too.The American Teen Genre has for a long time been perfected, but it has been lacking twists due to the fact they have no depth. Lets be honest, if you add depth to an American Teen film it stops being what it is meant to be.Enter ""The Girl Next door"". The Director has managed to make a film that still stays in the same genre, and yet has just enough depth to be able to pull off a few twists. What a good job the Director did too! There is not much let up, and one second your feeling sorry for him, another second your feeling happy for him as the film turns from being a comedy to a drama and back to a comedy again in a relentless fashion. Not quite edge of the seat stuff, but then again it isn't supposed to be. This genre isn't supposed to be this good! I must add a comment that it isn't a family film, and unless you want your kids to watch a few porn stars strut about your house plying there body's to would be producers and directors then you had better make sure you have got them to bed before you put the disc in.John Hughes, the director of Ferris, Uncle Buck and more has a new challenger.Great Story, well written and directed, great acting.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

Great Film,"After waiting ages to see the film and being ill on the week of release and being to busy to see the film at the cinema I finally got to see this rather addictive and brilliant film yesterday.The film is one of the best teen comedies in a long while with no disrespect to American Pie Series but this film was brilliant, and even more so as Elisha was given her chance to shine on the big stage.The film had loadsa plus points - the acting by Elisha was top notch, her portrayl of the character Danielle was brilliant - she really cared for Matthew and knew if he found out her secret he would not like her and she wanted him to like her for who she was. I felt this scene was really good as we got to see Danielle as a person and how she doesn't always want to b seen as a Porn Star.The interaction btween Danielle and Matthew was great - the chemistry was there alrighte - wish I was an actor and played the role of Matthew.One idea thoe I felt cud have lasted till the end is Danielle and Matthew getting together, it wud have been good if they got together just b4 the prom and the end not half way through it, as the second half of the film lacked spice I felt.Eli is one funny character - everytime he spoke he made me laugh and he reminds me of someone at my 6th form college. The supporting cast were excellent, Danielle's manager Kelly was funny and thought he was gonna get Matthew into trouble wiv the tape but was shocked to see what was on it, so Matthew kinda got his own back.I will definatly buy this film when it is released on DVD sometime soon I hope and will watch it again and again. For a longer and fully version of my own review on the film plz visit my site which will hopefully b updated more often in the coming weeks.This film is excellent, Elisha is amazing in this film and every scene she is in is brilliant as she lights up the screen wiv her looks, a truly talented and fine actress.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

Sophomoric Comedy Includes Three Good Performances,"Two young performers (Emile Hirsch and Elisha Cuthbert) make this formulaic coming-of-age comedy worth watching. While the style of the film was screwball comedy, Hirsch and Cuthbert delivered effective naturalistic performances, avoiding the clichés of so many of the ""over-the-top"" Hollywood farces geared to the teen audience. The early scenes of the film were especially touching in the innocence and sweetness captured by the two performers. It is there that the love relationship begins to develop and where both Hirsch and Cuthbert shine in their roles. Another good performance is by Timothy Olyphant as the sassy, smooth-talking con artist and film producer. The film as a whole is filled with stupid, juvenile scenes and antics, especially the trip to Las Vegas. But the three principal actors made the film enjoyable and even memorable.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance

Strictly for the Those with Low Brain Activity,"There is a movie viewer segment of such limited intelligence that they have never been able to experience a movie that actually insulted their intelligence. I understand that ""The Girl Next Door"" was made as a public service to these viewers and deliberately featured a screenplay so dumbed-down that even those just slightly above the moron level could have their first-ever intelligence insulting viewing experience.Start with a mix of ""Risky Business"" and ""Can't Hardly Wait"", extract all elements of charm that characterized those films, and then dumb-down the story as a public service to the brain-activity challenged members of the audience; and you have a good description of ""The Girl Next Door"".But it sure has a nice promotional poster. Elisha Cuthbert looks good posing and she does a decent job playing Elisha Cuthbert (who just happens to be ""The Girl Next Door""), but her range as an actress is too narrow to even be measured. Unfortunately for Cuthbert, ""This"" girl next door (a part most talented young ""actresses"" would love to play) is supposed to be a multi-dimensional character (for those in the target audience this means that the character is really two different people: ""a girl next door"" and a ""young but hardened by experience porn star""). If you have seen the movie and are still confused don't be embarrassed, nothing in Cuthbert's performance would lead anyone to believe she is a ""young but hardened by experience porn star"". That is because Cuthbert herself is not a ""young but hardened by experience porn star"". She would have to ""act"" differently than ""the girl next door"" to communicate this dimensionality to the audience. To do this she would have to be an ""actress"".So give Cuthbert credit for being able to pose for pictures and for being herself-she seems like a very nice girl that I would welcome as my neighbor. For some people that is enough, for those busy with the experience of having their intelligence insulted for the first time it is probably not important. The rest of us we would be hard pressed to find a worse way to spend our time.",3.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Wrongly titled film which should, instead, have been called.......""The Boy Next Door""","The ""Boy Next Door"" is an inspiring story of a young boy's beginning the journey into manhood........and in doing so, undertaking the quest of saving a girl from harmful forces overtaking her.

Nice and entertaining,I already had this movie for several months in my personal DVD collection and was waiting for a good moment to see it. A movie with Elisha Cuthbert is something you must wait for until you can't hold it anymore. Next to Mila Jovovich probably the most beautiful woman in the world. I was a bit afraid and was expecting just another teen movie to be honest. I was wrong. It was nice and entertaining. This is a movie you must see with your girlfriend or boyfriend. It will tell you about true love between two people and how far someone will go to give proof of that true love. If you watch carefully you will understand the lesson the director and the writer try to tell you. Next to Elisha Cuthbert I was surprised with the performance of Chris Marquette as Eli and Timothy Olyphant as Kelly. Marquette is very funny as the would-be porn director and whenever I saw Olyphant playing a had to think back to Michael Keaton in his earlier movies for some reason. Like I wrote I saw this movie on DVD and it has some great bonus material too. Interesting audio commentary and even a very nice trivia track. The hilarious feature called 'The Eli XXXperience' is a must see on the DVD. The movie has a bit of an open ending so when do we get 'The Girl Next Door 2 : Back In Business' ?

better than most,"Although I'm definitely not a fan of teen movies or anything really pop-culture or mainstream (since the majority of music and movies in that category are crap) this one was definitely a cut above the rest. I picked it up at a movie rental going over to a friend's because I was bored and Elisha Cuthbert is super hot, but contrary to what I was expecting (something along the lines of Not Another Teen Movie) it turned out to have fairly good performances, some great one-liners, not a bad soundtrack, adequate directing and was overall very enjoyable. The majority of the cast have convincing performances, with Kelly being by far the funniest, most varied and most complex character, and they all seem very comfortable in their roles. The movie, as most do, has its share of sappy scenes (such as at the party when he starts kissing her; although sappy and unrealistic, this part is still a crucial part of the plot), but they are outweighed by the comedy (""I swear if you don't f*ck her I'll kill myself!"") and some of the dramatic scenes. The movie doesn't get boring or repetitive, has mostly uninspired but not bad cinematography, moves along at a good pace but isn't overly long or short, and has a somewhat different plot than the generic boy-meets-girl sh*t that's clogging Hollywood (although they did partly bring that plague onto themselves). Overall, this movie is worth seeing more than once, strikes a good balance between drama and comedy, is quite enjoyable, features mostly good performances and entertaining characters, and is worth buying. Definitely a cut above the rest, and is on my list of most enjoyable movies.",,Anonymous,Romance
Pretty good teen movie,"The Girl Next Door is a pretty entertaining movie. It has many scenes that are hard not to watch and that make you interested in the unravelling of the film. Though it also got plenty of flaws - almost every single scene of the second half of the film seems to act as the climax, and then the movie keeps going - but it's also got one of the most appealing casts I've seen in a while. Emile Hirsh is the central character Matthew Kidman, about to graduate from high school. The girl next door is Elisha Cuthbert is the title character, Danielle. Her character acts very differently from the beginning to the end of the film. She changes quite drastically in personality and its quite good yet odd in a way. Also it was quite strange how at first from meeting Matthew the way she acts with him. It seemed like she was just using him, but as we see throughout the film she does end up liking him. Matthew's two friends and one of Danielle's associates played by Tim Olyphant are particular standouts in terms of comic relief; the movie is genuinely funny though also contains a few dramatic scenes (many involving Matthew & Kelly, and Matthew & Danielle- a strip club scene).Also I found many of the characters to be quite annoying, specifically Matthew's two friends- Eli and Klitz, and Kelly (he was very crude and weird). I feel the writers made his character too over-the-top. There are also some weird and quite odd scenes (Matthew's speech, limo scene) but overall the film is pretty entertaining as a whole.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Good Movie,"I found this a good movie. I think it has some good morale. Shows that not everything that u do tells the other's who you are.It also shows the greediness that exists out there.

I was fortunate enough to see it a couple of weeks ago at a sneak preview, and I was surprised at how much better it was than I had originally anticipated.  The initial marketing, to me, did not do the content of the film justice.  I expected a raunchy teen comedy along the lines of American Pie, Road Trip, or Eurotrip, but The Girl Next Door had a lot more heart and concern for the characters than any of those other films.Granted, it has its weak moments - I WISH someone like Danielle would move in next door and instantly be drawn to me like she was with Matt - but no one's claiming this will be an Oscar contender - and it doesn't try to be. It is a sweet story showing how a worldly-experienced, yet not-quite confident young woman brings a sort-of sheltered, naive young man out of his shell, with both of them benefiting from things they learn from each other.I hope this movie has good word-of-mouth appeal for audiences, since it does have a good cast, a good soundtrack, and a cheesy-but-sweet story.  I highly recommend that individuals see it for themselves before making an opinion based on critics' summaries - it's definitely worth the price of admission.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
"It's Risky Business-lite...a generic, but relatively inoffensive time-waster","Comparison with 80s hit Risky Business is inevitable for this romantic comedy about a high school student dating a porn star.Innocent A-student Matthew (Emile Hirsh), who is bizarrely both class president and unpopular, is transformed by meeting uberbabe Danielle, the girl next door, played by 24's Elisha Cuthbert. Their path to happiness is interfered with by a variety of characters, including themselves, Matthew's latently gay wannabe filmmaker buddy and Danielle's sleazy former producer slash boyfriend, Kelly. Go's Timothy Oliphant dominates the film with this role  Kelly is simultaneously dangerous, tempting and unpredictable.Directed by Luke Greenfield (The Animal) and scripted by Stuart Blumberg (Keeping the Faith), The Girl Next Door intersperses saccharine moments (for example, Matthew's botched speech) with cheeky asides, such as Matthew's involuntary porn fantasies. It's no classic but it works, thanks to committed performances from the three leads. Although Cuthbert's role is undemanding, newcomer Emile Hirsch gives good camera as the earnest, yearning Matthew. There's also some cheeky plot twists and the ending is great fun. **½/***** stars.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance
Hidden gen - 100%,"I saw the movie when it first came out and I was a teenager myself at the time. I've loved it for many reasons - the music/soundtrack, the actors, the characters, story and so on.In my humble opinion, a good movie is when one can see himself in one of the characters and I can 100% see myself as many of those characters in different situations and you know - I feel nostalgic for something that the characters went through - wtf?!The movie is always available on one of the platforms (Stan, netflix, prime video etc) and it's well worth the watch.

Very Cool Movie,"First of all I admit I like the basic story of this movie. And about casting & direction its just perfect.I enjoyed every minute of it. If you like teenage comedy movie, then its perfect for you. & really like the climax. Not its DVD & blue ray's are out. so you can grab it. Largely (and unjustly) ignored at the box office this teen comedy starts of really well and within the first few moments had me rolling with laughter. The movie starts with a montage of sorts, we see the jocks, brains and cheerleader-types all stating, for their entry in the yearbook, what they ""will always remember."" Then there is Matt (played by Hirsch) who is pondering this question. Sure, he has had a successful academic career - as illustrated by his acceptance to Georgetown - but he really hasn't done anything memorable in his senior year of high school.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
We've seen this before,"'Girl' follows the story of one Matthew Kidman (Emile Hirsch) as he encounters new girl next door Danielle (24's Elisha Cuthbert) and gets involved in her life. Turns out she's a porn star, which Matt's friend Eli (Chris Marquette) lets him in on. So naturally the movie takes several zany twists and turns, from the kids going to Vegas to stalk Danielle at a porn movie convention to Matt getting mixed up with Danielle's dangerous manager, Kelly (Timothy Olyphant). There are enough twists and turns to keep things lively, and enough laughs to entertain most of the time.Hirsch is effective as Matt; he plays his innocence well, and has enough young boy charm and good looks to win the viewer over. Cuthbert, resembling here a sexier, more beautiful version of a young Debby Harry, is also fairly good, switching back and forth between normal girl and porn star fairly well. Most of the supporting cast is fine; Olyphant is particularly sharp, and I enjoyed Marquette, but that's probably because he reminded me of a smart ass I knew in high school (he even looked like him). In fact, overall, the film is reasonably entertaining.There's just one catch; you've seen this movie before, and it was called Risky Business. Virtually everything is the same; the hooker is now a porn star, and we're freeing a Vietnamese genius student rather than repairing daddy's Porsche, but in essence the movie is exactly the same, from the young guy falling for a much more experienced partner to the menacing manager (Olyphant was good, but he's no Joe Pants) even to the very way they choose to absolve the main character's debt. The movie follows Risky Business page for page, even closely substituting the obscene catch phrase with one very similar to it. In some respects this film exceeds its source material  Elisha Cuthbert is far better than Rebecca De Mornay, whom I never really thought was any good in the first place  but Hirsch is no Tom Cruise, and in the end, you're just basically getting the same story with some of the rougher edges sanded down told to a new generation. Worth looking at if you don't mind that, but be aware that's exactly what you're getting.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance
Great!!!,"I don't know what movie that other guy saw, but my friends and I who saw this tonight absolutely loved it. It's very Risky Business-esque. I mean that in a good way. It's a lot smarter, funnier, and darker than most teen comedies.Emile Hirsh was great in the title role. I've liked him before and he continues to be excellent here. Elisha Cuthbert is HOT!!! She's also very good in the film. While I don't love her on 24, she does a really good job here as the pron actress. And did I mention she is hot.Anyway, I think people will really dig this movie if they check it out. And they should.",,Anonymous,Romance
"A hormone driven movie that's better and different, and it's carried by the cute and sexy Elisha Cuthbert.","""The Girl Next Door"" is well done and has all the elements of your typical hormone teen flick, yet it's a little different than most, by having characters discover their true feelings and finding love in the most unexpected way. Emile Hirsch stars as Matthew Kidman a high school senior who's a brain and uptight never having any fun, until one day when he discovers his new next door neighbor(Elisha Cuthbert) who just happens to be hot so he tries to give her a try! The opening scene when Matthew sees her thru the open window next door is just great, oh that backside of Elisha! Well upon meeting and finding her name as Danielle they begin to talk, hang out and become friends, only Matthew soon discovers that Danielle is an ex porn star now his world and culture starts to spin out of control! True this film is your typical hormone driven sex flick with plenty of teen pranks, and many sexy scenes and quotes, yet the development of a loving and caring relationship forms between the two central characters. Many of the movies things are crazy but yet they help bring both Matthew and Danielle to love like the Las Vegas porn convention and the prom night sex education video! I must say the performance of Elisha Cuthbert is fabulous she's so cute and sexy and many scenes of her in this film were so hot! Especially the window and pool scenes, and the hotel clothing take off when she sported that sexy red bra and panties! Elisha really carried this film she's really a beautiful and sexy star. Finally ""The Girl Next Door"" shows and teaches a viewer that love can be found for anyone no matter how different the backgrounds and that success and happiness can be obtained in the craziest ways.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
where are the Asians?,"I was not going to write a comment, but I was just thinking how come I didn't see any Asians in this film? I started to notice about this phenomena ever since I saw the film ""Minority report"" which did not have any Asian actors in them.Have you ever seen an Asian male jock in any of the Hollywood high school or college movies? I don't think that there is one. There maybe some Asian girls as the popular students, but I have never seen any Asian males in any leading characters in any high school or college movies.That guy Sannang reminds me of the Asian character in ""Breakfast at Tifannys"" which was very racially offensive to all Asians. Even though Sannang is supposed to be very smart, but look at him, he talks like an idiot, and he looks funny. The whole high school was laughing at him when his video was shown. The director chose to make him a ""smart"" student, that did not reduce his true intent which is to make fun of this Asian in degrading ways. That is very wrong. If he chose an African student to make fun of, would the blacks tolerate such a thing? I don't think so. If he wants to make fun of Asians, at least he should have hired another Asian actor for a positive role. Asians should not be silent again, we should not just take it for granted that Asians should be invisible in Hollywood movies!In this film, all the jocks are white, the protagonist and his two friends are also white. The teachers are also white. The only Asian female actor was a porn star in this movie. The high school is supposed to be somewhere outside of Los Angeles. Asian students can be found in almost all California high schools, how can it be possible that in that particular high school, there was no Asian students? It doesn't make sense that those ""jocks"" were willing to make a video with those porn stars. And when Kelly wants to have a private talk with Matthew at the end, where did the principal go? How did Matthew become the president of the student body if he is not even popular? How can Kelly get a whole bottle of Ectasy drug directly from the glove compartment, what if he the police stops him one day and search his car? And his parents were OK to let him to go out with that girl late at night even though they just met?",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
squeeze the juice,"The Girl Next Door is a perfect film for the movie night. It's fun, entertaining. It's not that serious, but at the same time it has a point. And I liked a plot a lot. Quite original in my opinion. Credit to director Luke Greenfield for not letting this one to go too out of hands by putting in some intense scenes as well. It's a top notch entertainment.Young actors Emile Hirsch and Paul Dano look very young here. They do fine, especially Hirsch by developing his character. But it is Elisha Cuthbert who steals every minute of the screen. Arguably one of the hottest characters. Her sexiness is irresistible. Jeez, burns like a fire.There is definitely something instructional in this movie. It is summed up nicely in this metaphor used in the movie: 'you got to know whether the juice is worth to squeeze or not.' So squeeze whenever you can. I prefer orange juice.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

Great Neighbour!!!,"I thought this film was absolutely great!! The characters were all good and unique, and the main characters (played by Emile Hirsch and Elisha Cuthbert)were very well acted out.Elisha Cuthbert is absolutely gorgeous, and she fitted the role very very well. The movie wouldn't have the same effect if it wasn't for her being cast as Danielle.I also think the idea of a girl moving in next door and being absolutely out of this world is a good concept - if only it happened more often to single guys.A strong effect this movie had on me is because I am single (or i am at the time I am writing this anyway!!, after watching this movie I really wanted a girlfriend myself, but after all, there is only one Elisha Cuthbert, and if it wasn't for her, this movie wouldn't have been half as good as it was!",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
A great movie,"Personally I only got this movie cos there was nothing else at the video club and I thought what the heck it'll just be another teen movie. Not to mention I didn't know any of the actors. Until Danielle makes him strip naked I was kinda bored, but that made me sit up and think,this is interesting....From then on the movie just got better and better resulting in a great ending and you realise that young people really can fall in love and sacrifice everything!! A thoroughly enjoyable movie.There was chemistry between the two,something which many teen movies lack. I would rate it 7/10 but 6.8 is good enough!

teen sex romp,Matthew Kidman (Emile Hirsch) is a straight A student council president who looks back at his high school life without really living to the fullest. He gets into Georgetown and is trying to get a scholarship. He and his friends Eli (Chris Marquette) and Klitz (Paul Dano) are outsiders. Then Danielle (Elisha Cuthbert) moves in next door and Matthew falls for her hard. Porn obsessed Eli recognizes Danielle from a video. They break up and then he finds her with her old boyfriend porn producer Kelly (Timothy Olyphant).It has some funny moments mostly from Chris Marquette. It's a sharp take on the teen sex romp. Emile Hirsch is way too whiny. It has a bit of Risky Business but it's also uncomfortable adult. It takes a wrong turn going to the porn convention. It overloads on the adult entertainment side and stops being a fun teen sex romp. It would be helpful to develop the other high school characters and less with the adult entertainers.,5.0,Anonymous,Romance

"The film is a handsome surprise, albeit with comedy which doesn't always work and stances not hammered home; regardless, it is a hearty and substantial enough piece.","The Girl Next Door actually makes for a really involving and respectable enough piece, at least it does so right up to the point the lead nabs a peck with that of the titular girl next door. The whole thing might have made for a really smart short; Luke Greenfield striking us as a director able to slot together a telling piece and as a person able to establish; engage; progress and then conclude, with the film loosing rather a bit of energy once everything tanks to that the deserts of Nevada for a lot of running around and the forcing of the lead to having to infiltrate a mansion. Ultimately, the premise of a porn star moving in next door as a kid and his sexist, overly hormonal friends burgeon from school to university rings false; that is to say, the film is in no way the turgid, unholy mess that is worryingly promised when we observe it is about such a thing. Rather, the film takes its idea and decides to put its surprisingly likable young lead through a wringer of anti-social interactions; altercations with dangerous people and through a series of threatening situations which might spiral out of control after having been dragged to places those within feel they are adept to, but in actual fact are punching well above their weights.The young lead is that of Matthew Kidman (Hirsch), an individual on the cusp of shifting from one level of the American educational system to the next, that of high-school and on into a somewhat prestigious university to study politics. Kidman is stuck in a proverbial middle-ground of no man's land within the realms of his school's social hierarchy; he is nowhere near that of a hardened jock, as is exemplary in the masses of cock-sure young men and their large automobiles-plus-successes-with-women whom surround his educational zone; but he is additionally, and on account of two frizzy-haired friends of his, several steps up from being labelled of the ""geek"" variety - Matt just existing on a plateau populated by himself as this middling kid, with few distinguishing features nor behavioural patterns. The finale of high school is nearing, and yearbooks are in the process of being filled; our Kidman struggling in that he cannot get words onto paper nor photographs of into albums when challenged with the idea of recording the events and the people that helped form him in his time there. The kid is on the verge of graduation without having faced the ignominy of marginalisation at the hands of the institute's proverbial bullies, nor indeed has he intermingled at the opposite end of the spectrum by garnering success at having captained the school's champion Football team to glory.The film covers somewhat of an important chapter in Matthew's life as he dares to branch away; dares to push the boat out and get heavily involved in something seemingly way over his head, a general happening brought about by that aforementioned pornography actress. Elisha Cuthbert plays that actress, a woman named Danielle; a woman of slender figure, slinky movement, pouting lips and bright blonde hair, whose moving into the house next door to that of Matt's parents takes very little time for him to notice as such. From these beginnings, an energetic tale is spun out of a young adult with a blossoming persona which could tilt either way, and it is Danielle who goes on to further him down the route of formulating memories; something to write about and pictures of whatever that is required for that part of the yearbook - the joy being in how it sways him towards a mindset more inclined to be nastier and more sordid, before pulling it back and keeping it grounded whilst not falsifying its politics to any alarming extent.Eventually, that of Timothy Olyphant's pornographer Kelly Simon enters proceedings; the film constructing somewhat of an initially positive and reassuring image of the man before slowly peeling away at the surface and beginning to paint a scummy, abject incarnation of the individual. His arc in this sense runs in tandem with that of his field's representation, which is sort of shown up, as a vacuous; aggressive minefield of maliciousness once everyone has been dragged out to Las Vegas for a Doug Liman's ""Go"" inspired romp so as to escape a proverbial wrath, although appears to recall that the film's target audience may very well be all-too fond of such things and thus, disappointingly restrains said politic from being too damning. Principally, the film is a coming of age; American high-school orientated sex comedy following someone nervous about the sex and with an attitude to the comedy which is strictly grounded and politically straight-and-narrow. The film's presence of a female, specifically that of someone whom specialises in being a star of pornography, is not the flimsy, loose-cannoned and misjudged procession of smut and trash that it might have been; rather, it is about a woman coming into the life of a young man, but being able to have the power to shape and inspire rather than roll over and play dead as an object of one's fantasies. The Girl Next Door is a middling, oft confused piece, but with content to get involved in and characters to get behind: a welcome change for the usual fare of this ilk.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
This movie changed my life,"I can't believe this movie is from 20 years ago. I watched this movie when it first came out on DVD back in 2004. I had just turned 15 at the time and I can genuinely say it changed the entire course of my life. It's one of the rare rom-com/high school movies from predominantly a male perspective. Mean Girls came out the same year and is much more popular, but as a guy, The Girl Next Door is a lot more relatable to me. Superbad is from a male perspective, but as more of a romantic, it doesn't have the same effect on me as The Girl Next Door.After 20 years, the core message of this movie (is the juice worth the squeeze?) has still stayed with me. I re-watch this movie every year and always re-watch it after every breakup and failed relationship. I think deep down every single one of us guys (even those of us who are in our mid-30s) is still craving for our own ""Danielle"" to rescue us from the tediousness and doldrum of everyday life, whether it's as a high school nerd or a cog in a machine at a dead-end job. I also don't think it's a stretch to say most of us still pretty much want the same thing we wanted when were 18: the drop-dead gorgeous girl next door that you would sacrifice anything for. The perfect goddess that you would love unconditionally for the rest of your life because she gave you a shot when none of the other pretty girls would. You don't care about her past, her baggage because to she's saving you more than you're saving her. It's a chance to breath, to enjoy youth, to live your life to the fullest, and most of all, to prevent you from a lifetime of regrets and misery once you reach middle age. This movie is also a reminder of a simpler time (the music, the fashion, the politically incorrect slangs) in suburban America that I miss dearly.Before I watched The Girl Next Door, I was just like Matthew. Nerdy, well-meaning, risk-averse goody-two-shoes. My so-called friends were just like Eli and Klitz. Instead of improving themselves (both appearance and social skills) to make themselves more appealing to girls, they were content with playing video games, watching porn, and socializing with other misfits. My parents were strict and highly-educated professionals. They hated the entire youth culture at the time (fashion, music, etc) and forbid me from partaking in it. I was screaming inside, but I had no way out until I watched The Girl Next Door. This movie gave me hope and taught me that it was possible for the girl of my dreams to see something worthwhile in someone like me. It still gives me hope today, 20 years later, and reminds me to never give up on finding my ""girl next door.""I recently show this movie to my mom for the first time and she predictably hated it. She simply can't fathom how someone smart and ambitious like Matthew was willing to throw caution in the wind and his entire future on the line for a ""porn star"" with obvious a lot of emotional baggage and from a poor/lower class background. For me, this conversation highlighted the fundamental difference of our outlook on life (I've dated plenty of girls without fancy degrees and some who didn't even go to college) and I'm glad that, thanks to this movie, I was able to at least make something out of my high school, college, and 20s. This movie changed my life and quite frankly rescued me from a lifetime of misery. There is something pure and timeless about this beautiful movie. I'll never stop revisiting it at least once a year.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Too much of everything (well, except for the girl...)","Clearly a lot of research went into this 'ambitious' teen movie, as it packed in more unnecessary plot twists than a whole series of 90210.Perhaps it's just nostalgia, but I remember with fondness the teen movies such as 'Risky Business' or 'Can't Buy Me Love', where the premise (although equally simply - loser/lifeless guy needs some lovin') dominates the movie, instead of becoming secondary. In 'The Girl Next Door', the fact that the delicious girl is a porn star is the premise - not the plot. It's not a 'oh my god, she's a porn star!' it's a 'hey, look and see what wacky hijinks can come out of this!'. How does a porn star girlfriend help you solve your everyday teen problems? Potentially entertaining, but less than incredible.As an alternate, I would actually suggest the unheralded 'The New Guy', which takes an equally ridiculous premise, but renders it in a much more coherent, episodic fashion.Not, mind you, that this movie is a total loss (6/10). The supporting cast are great (especially the porn producer) and, good lord, she is yummy. A great soundtrack rounds it out nicely. As does the gratuitous (but unfortunately, NOT over-the-top) flesh.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Brilliant coming of age flick and a rip-off of Risky Business all in one,"I was completely blown away by this movie. The first half hour was what I expected from the commercials - the typical teenage sex romp, T&A flick that has been done a million times, showing nothing more inventive than American Pie or Porky's before it. At this point I wrote the movie off as nothing better, nothing worse then what came before it.Then, at about the hour mark, it morphs into one of the best coming of age movies Hollywood has produced in a long time. Suddenly the story is not about Elisha Cuthbert's physical attributes (though they are lovely), but about the perfect student/son breaking out of his cocoon and finding his true self in the ether.At the same time the movie transforms from a fairly standard teen flick into one of the more bizarre comedies released in some time. The movie unleashes a series of plot twists stranger than the one before it, culminating in an inventive climax and resolution.Add in some of the biggest belly laughs I've had at the movies since Old School, and it becomes perhaps the second most brilliant movie in the coming of age genre after Fast Times.Now, that said, it is important to note that ""Girl Next Door"" is a total ripoff of Risky Business. And a lazy one at that. The similarities are many - perfect son/student rescues sweet girl from flesh trade, fighting off evil, violent pimp/manager, etc. In fact, they go as deep as the editing and the way particular music was used to highlight key scenes.The assessment? If you can forget cinematic history, this is one of the more inventive, original and charming pieces of comedic cinema I have experienced in the last, say, five years. If you must remain true to what has come previously, it's a charming rip-off.9/10",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
"A pleasant surprise, as it manages to present these ideas in a fun and differentiated way. The film is sexy without being flashy and funny without being over the top","In the 1980s, films made for teenagers followed the style of Porky's (by Bob Clark, 1982) and Revenge of the Nerds (by Jeff Kanew, 1984) of snarky, scatological and almost pornographic humor. At the end of the last century, the style was revived by American Pie (by Pal Weitz, 1999). But just as Risky Business (by Paul Brickman, 1983) managed to be sexy and different from what was standard for its time, The Girl Next Door, by Luke Greenfield) proved to be a differentiated example in the mid-2000s, gaining enormous popularity.Here, Matthew Kidman (Emile Hirsch, from The Emperor's Club) is a studious, well-behaved boy, one of those who care about noble causes, who is about to graduate from high school (the second degree here in Brazil). But he and his nerdy best friends (why is it that in every movie of the genre there are always stereotypes?) are virgins and not very successful with the girls. Matthew's life changes when he meets Danielle (Elisha Cuthbert, from the 24 series), a beautiful girl who moves in next door to his (as the original title suggests, 'the girl next door') and who ends up awakening in Matthew a side that until then he was unaware of. Only Matthew discovers that the beautiful Danielle is, in fact, a porn actress.The problem is that the similarities between the stories of ""Risky Business"" and ""Show Next Door"" are so profound that they diminish the virtues of the new film. Interestingly, Next Door Show does not assume any relationship with Risky Business, appropriating its premise without offering credit to director and screenwriter Paul Brickman, responsible for the work that brought the attention of Hollywood to the young Cruise. Check it out: in place of Joel Goodsen (Tom Cruise in his first big role) is Matthew Kidman (Emile Hirsch), both hardworking students and about to go to prestigious universities. The prostitute played by Rebecca De Mornay gives way to a porn actress, the role of Elisha Cuthbert. Pimp Guido (Joe Pantoliano) is now erotic film producer Kelly (Timothy Olyphant). And the gem that disappears from Joel's house and makes him have to earn a lot of money overnight is turned into an Asian exchange student. Perhaps one of the big differences between the two is that ""Show Next Door"" is supposed to excite the boys more than the girls. Although Emile Hirsch has an innocent look (and resembles a certain Leonardo DiCaprio), he still lacks the same charm that Cruise already demonstrated 20 years ago. What's more, instead of having the Top Gun star glide around the house in his socks and underwear, the new film features Elisha Cuthbert's character stripping down to his underwear while Matthew ""accidentally"" watches.Unfortunately, the script by plagiarists Stuart Blumberg, Brent Goldberg and David Wagner is not very concerned with giving verisimilitude to the motivations of their characters, and the same lack of criteria can be seen in other aspects of the plot - or do you really believe that some employee of Would the bank allow a large withdrawal without the client presenting his documents? Furthermore, the old cliché of the ""speech-that-is-applauded-standing"" is used, in The Girl Next Door, in a context that borders on the ridiculous: such a speech could only arouse the admiration of an audience that was under the effect of hallucinogenic drugs. As if that were not enough, the film even includes several sequences in which the protagonist fantasizes about absurd situations - something that, despite being occasionally funny, leads the viewer to distrust everything he sees, since any scene can, from one moment to another, turns out to be just Matthew's illusion.The script will not miss any of the classic clichés of the genre, such as showing Matthew in trouble caused by the seductive girl - he even gets involved with an ex-boyfriend and producer of the girl, Kelly. The script also lends itself to all those scatological jokes so common nowadays, but its most serious problem is that it blurs the course of the story from the relationship between Matthew and Danielle to other parallel situations that were infinitely less interesting. Even Danielle loses space in the final half hour of the film, becoming almost a luxury extra.Despite everything, Show Next Door offers two rewards for those who venture to watch it: the great performance of Timothy Olyphant, who transforms the cynical Kelly into a fun and surprisingly charismatic character; and, as I mentioned earlier, the stunning beauty of Elisa Cuthbert. On the other hand, it is at least ridiculous to realize that, despite playing a porn star, the actress does not appear naked for a moment. She seems to be the film's cowardice, who strives to look ""spicy"", but doesn't even have the courage to show off her protagonist's body (other actresses appear topless). In this sense, it is curious to observe how ""political correctness"" has turned Hollywood into a prudish lady: more than 20 years ago, Rebecca De Mornay did not hesitate to show nudity in Risky Business - after all, that's what her character demanded. Now in the 21st century, we only have a 'free censorship' version of a porn movie actress, which, of course, weakens her story.It is interesting to note that Cuthbert is much sexier when she is Danielle than when she fully assumes the role of Athena, her ""stage name"". She proves a talent that is erased among the screams, running and trouble that her character gets into the TV series. But who steals the show is Olyphant. He ranges from the older guy who is almost like a brother to the selfish businessman who only thinks about taking advantage of situations. His cynicism never lets on whether or not he's a nice guy.Luke Greenfield's direction is good when he manages to make the film funny by focusing on the couple's romance. Luke has a recent career, his previous biggest ""hits"" being ""Animal"" with Rob Schneider. He has only 4 films on his resume, so we can see his talent for comedy. Despite ""Animal"" not receiving good reviews, Luke manages to turn it around in this comedy that manages to hold us in its 105 minutes (longer than most of the usual comedies). To accompany each key scene, the director managed to paste a music that is at least good. To give you an idea, the film begins with ""Under Pressure"", which brought together Queen and David Bowie, and ends with ""Baba O'Riley"", by Who, totaling 37 songs, not including the incidental soundtrack created by Paul Haslinger.Despite showing everything that has already been seen hundreds of times in the cinema, ""The Girl Next Door"" is a pleasant surprise, as it manages to present these ideas in a fun and differentiated way. The film is sexy without being flashy and funny without being over the top. Proof of this are Matt's great daydreams, which are funny, without showing any kind of bodily secretion. Excellent fun with unforgettable scenes (Matt naked in the middle of the street; invasion of the swimming pool of Matt's school principal; the robbery of the trophy from Kelly's rival's house; the speech with Matt on drugs and all the scenes involving the young genius from Cambodia, Samnang (or Samsung); all scenes involving friends Klitz and Eli and, of course, the production of the ""educational"" film in the final stretch of the film). Certainly, it is a film that had a strong impact on young people of the mid-2000s. A simple film, not very original as already said, but very entertaining.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Overpriced,"Goody goody student perverts sex into profit.The deep depravity of the Reaganite fairytale.

Ouch.High production value and good acting, but so many jokes missed, so much irony ignored.

I don't get it...,"Wow - I don't understand how this movie got so many positive reviews. I personally believe this is one of, if not the, worst movies I have EVER seen. The plot is totally unbelievable, and the main character reminded me way too much of a Fred Savage wannabe.The movie is also super complicated: I've singled out about 7 different plots - that's incredible! The first half of the movie was OK, in an American Pie sort of way, but the rest was just added on cheese. Every time you think the movie will end, it just keeps ON GOING - like forever! I think I preferred Chris Marquette and Paul Dano's acting than Emile Hirsch's - he just didn't seem in his element. I seriously was just waiting for a Wonder Years voice-over at almost every scene of the movie.And the imagined scenes were just too complicated and clumsy for this movie...

An Enjoyable Sex Comedy with Surprising Charm,"The Girl Next Door delivers exactly what it promises-a fun and raunchy sex comedy that provides plenty of laughs. While it follows some familiar tropes of the genre, its witty script and likable cast help elevate it beyond the typical teen comedy. The chemistry between the leads is undeniable, and the film skillfully balances its more risqué moments with genuine emotional beats. While some of the humor may feel predictable or dated to some viewers, it still has enough charm and heart to keep things entertaining. With its mix of humor, romance, and a bit of nostalgia, The Girl Next Door is a surprisingly enjoyable ride for fans of lighthearted comedies. It may not break new ground, but it's a fun watch that doesn't take itself too seriously.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
The movie next door,"An enticing movie, The Girl Next Door is a story involving the typical loser, Matthew Kidman, played by Emile Hirsch and ""Danielle"", played by Elisha Cuthbert.Danielle is the girl next door, the ex pornography star who decides that the ordinary life is the good life, while Matthew is the affixed neighbour who falls in love at first sight.Character development is strong, helping to maintain director Luke Greenfield's steady pace. We see the extension of supporting actors Chris Marquette and Paul Dano, who provide much needed humour and support to Hirsch.Overall, this film presents a situation which most would find difficult to manage. It explores the pornography industry as perhaps a place of loneliness and misunderstanding, and by and large I would recommend anyone who is able to appreciate such themes to see this film.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Relatively underrated title in the genre of teen romantic comedy,"I have no idea why this movie took in such a poor gross revenue since it was actually exceptionally good in the golden era of teen comedy.
Even though the plot as a whole is kinda cliched and predictable, it is still up-to-scratch to convey meaningful messages to audience like the sacrifice for loved ones when 'the juice is worth the squeeze' or the importance of having an eventful and wildly unforgettable high school years. Besides, the way the main characters resolved a series of continuous troubles is sublimely brilliant, in spite of some illogical trivia like the crime report scene (not going in details due to the spoilers-free status) or the quick mind-changing moments of the characters.
Finally, the performance of Elisha Cuthbert was remarkably well-acted as she vibrantly shows the personality of both a former porn star - seductive and easy-going, and a passionate lover, supportive and cheerful. Her physically attractive appearance with golden blonde hair and nice body is also notable and suitable for the role.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
my notes,"Pretty funny and pretty awesome, especially olyphant. also has some heavy cheese and rom-com-y-ness. and there were some very questionable parts and dumb things that happened story-wise. but for the most part the story was cool. it had likable characters. and was generally entertaining (about 3 viewings)",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Decent Start But Deteriorates Fast,"This was one of the biggest steaming cow pies of the genre I've ever seen. Yes it starts kind of cute although in reality the the female lead here would have of course had nothing to do with the brainy neighbor next door, who plays the male lead. But it was kind of fresh and funny, even though all Cuthbert's character did was give sexy glances and look seductive. It's really all she's good for in any role. The pieces start to not fit together pretty quickly though, right around the time the producer shows up. Then we get nothing but ridiculous plot twists and completely idiotic, juvenile scenes that just strain credibility way beyond the breaking point. Even the main actors seemed to all of a sudden forget how to act, as if they knew the movie had veered into the realm of the absurd. For example: The dumbest speech is given at a banquet, and not only does it get lauded but a standing ovation at that. And it was horrible! And what kind of an idiot would say that a classic GYO muscle car is for fa*s. It's the toughest car ever built! Just mindless things like that. And it went on and on and downhill from there. Dialogue beyond awful and silly overacting. Sappy eye rolling little scenes and talks. The whole end sequence at the prom was beyond asinine as well. That movie could have been filmed anywhere but why they decided to film it at the school was just dense. His bumbling friends really get tiresome towards the end as well. His parents, and all the adults for that matter, were portrayed as simple minded clowns. But expecially his parents. Sooooo clueless......And excuse me, but there's no way a bank teller would give that amount of money without verifying a signature. These are not small holes, they're huge gaps that sink the credibility of an entire movie.",2.0,Anonymous,Romance
This sweet romantic comedy is ABOUT not PART OF the porn industry.,"Matthew has spent his high-school years valuing high-achieving, so when he meets (Elisha Cuthbert) in the lead-up to his scholarship application speech for Georgetown, she helps him see some other sides to himself. Things change when he finds out she might be from an entirely different side of the tracks...The marketing was somewhat misleading for this flick. Although the concepts are definitely for mature audiences - a porn industry event (sans nudity), two short shots of actual porn, quite a bit of language and adult themes, this movie is not by any means exploitation. The radiant Elisha Cuthbert who we've come to know and love from 24 is beautiful but doesn't have to do any frontal nudity.Its basically a sweet romantic comedy at heart, a coming of age story, and a story about leaving high-school that everyone can relate to. Like I said, i'd still recommend only mature audiences - but for us, its a surprisingly sweet evening.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Show The Daddy (How It's Done),"Let's get something clear first  I hate teenage comedies. Why? Because they're stupid, seriously NOT funny (at all I may add) and copycatted. Basic plot for a teen comedy goes something like this ('I've got the power'): A Guy who is usually a schmock, who nobody likes and bigger boys like to play pranks with him, falls in love with A Girl of some high status or whatever. He has A Buddy (or more) who is funny but ugly as hell, whit whom The Guy advises with. Now after a few minutes of boiling, add sex, nudity, foul language, a streak of homosexual references. Let it cook for about five minutes. If that's not enough, add more sex and nudity. After that add The Idiot (who will make The Guy regret he was born) and The Man (most good-lookin' guy in school). If THAT ain't enough add more nudity. This is a recipe for a BAD teen comedyUnfortunately in the last 20 years there hasn't been a sincere teen comedy. The last good one I saw was 'The Breakfast Club' and that's well I'll be damned 20 years ago! After a series of teen comedies for retarded somebody has remembered how things used to be done in the old days and made The Girl Next Door. It doesn't have anything new to say about love or romance but it has a soul and 'a most appealing crew I saw in years' as one of my fellow IMDb colleague 'critics' wrote.Movie follows the basic teen plot: guy meets a girl, falls in love, loses the girl and spends the rest of the movie trying to win her back The point is I never saw sidekicks so live, situations more-or-less real and confusion and fantasies presented with such reality. Script is excellent and jokes (told so many times now) are somehow revived and renewed so they look fresh and inspiring. The usual teen comic relief character (AKA The Idiot) is given a 'Max Payne' personality (see the movie, you'll get it). The sidekicks are excellently written and acted, and somehow reminded me of Bill & Ted. Surprisingly there are no 'bad guys' around, no slutty sex-crave college girls.Now as you can see, I really, really, really liked this movie. Please see it, you might like it too. 9/10",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Just as bad as you 1st think,"The only thing good that can be said about this film would be that it has a great soundtrack. Everything else - while not entirely predictable/ standard formula - doesn't come as much of a surprise. As you watch the movie you will notice several points where it would seem that the movie would naturally end - but instead you realize that it still has over an hour left! The creators of this flick wasted a great opportunity to do SOMEthing with the movie - anything. This movie accheived ""nowhere"" status because it tried to go in so many directions at once.

"Jon Monsarrat review: Nothing special, not so funny","The Girl Next Door isn't a bad flick, but it seemed deeply conflicted as to whether it was a comedy or a serious drama. You know, in comedies, there's pain and social awkwardness -- but it's cartoony. There's some real pain in The Girl Next Door, and it just isn't funny. There are some neat plot twists, and the moral messages were a little too heavyhanded.Who should see this film:-- Teenagers with nothing better to do, on a rainy day, but don't expect any T&A-- Porn stars who are both extremely self-confident and emotionally centered but still somehow, not.I'll give ""The Girl Next Door"" a nothing special 6 out of 10.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Sexual fantasy for the timid teens.,"This movie is sort of like a softcore-softcore porn for teens. Where the jocks don't get the hottest girls because they are callous and snarky. While our group of typical kids who are often overlooked get the girls because they are nice...while in reality we all know who gets the girl. But it's a fun fantasy for those who never got the hot girl, and don't have a slightest clue how to even go about it.The movie just works. While it it's for me. I have friends who absolutely adore this film and I can easily see why. It's fun, it's sexy, with an amazing female lead, who is easy to fall in love with on the screen.Lastly, while I think 6 stars is a bit generous for my taste, I see how this movie can capture the imaginations of young boys, and perhaps give them confidence to perhaps go out on the limb and try talking to some women who are out of their league...because in reality you never really know.Enjoy!",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

The Girl Next Door - Don't bother knocking,"I'm a guy and have to say, this is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I wanted a refund even though I borrowed the DVD from the library for free. Don't even compare this flick with Risky Business, as many writers on this website has done. One is a classic and the other a pointless waste of film.Yes, Elisha Cuthbert is intensely beautiful and I hope to see her more frequently on the big screen. But The Girl Next Door utterly lacked substance and intelligence in order to showcase Cuthbert to horny teenagers in the audience. I don't mind the improbable and silly plot if they'd only work on the ridiculous dialogue -- ridiculous even for a lame-brain teen movie. I'll even overlook the nonsensical way Danielle and Matthew developed their affection if they'd just use some neurons in writing the script.The film was probably written for the sub-14 year old crowd, those who managed to sneak in to this rated R dog of a film.

"For me, its going into the teen movie hall of fame.","The Girl Next Door, comes off as a little bit generic. For one, the story has pretty much been done before(i.e. Risky Business), Its the boy meet girl scenario which has been done a million times over from a million different angles and it its sprinkled a-plenty with tons of cheesy moments. But its the moments outside the cheesy ones that count in this film. The acting is excellent with some amazing characters making it the perfect combo in that category. The three main actors in the film,(Timothy Olyphant,Emile Hirsch,Elisha Cuthbert) are the some of the most engaging characters that I've seen in a comedy in awhile. Which admittedly isn't saying much but either way, the characters are good. Really, there's many other films out there that are much better than this, but its still worth a watch if there's not much else you can watch.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Brilliant,"Any person that believes that this movie is an accurate picture of our society today should have their genitalia removed.  Seriously, can't anyone just go to the movies and have an enjoyable experience without some nit-picker telling you how American women are easy going and very sexual. Do you know that in foreign countries such as Amsterdam, people have thousands of sexual partners? You wanna talk about loose women, don't talk about American women.I'm not going to waste my energy anymore.When I went to go see the movie, I had heard that the plot paralleled with Risky Business or American Pie.  While the film contained some of the elements of each, you really can't compare them. Yes I know that the plot is the same in Risky except with a porn star, but this was still better.In my opinion, American Pie was just an excuse to give us Shannon Elizabeth naked (and I'm not saying that's a bad thing.)  But if you want to talk about the epitome of teen life, American Pie just doesn't do it.  Yes, a large majority drink at parties and many have sex.  American Pie really didn't offer the character development that Girl Next Door offered.  In my opinion, it was better for me to relate to Emile Hirsch's character rather than Jason Biggs.The casting director should be given a reward for finding one of the most attractive and talented actress in Hollywood right now.  Not only did she blow me away with her striking good looks, but her acting was truly wonderful.  She played every aspect of the role well and made a convincing Want-to-get-out-the-business porn star.At the beginning, when we first met Eli, the sex-crazed friend of the main character, I could tell he would be a riot to watch.  All his one-liners and drawn out speeches were hilarious. Masterful comedic timing enhanced every line and had me rolling in my seat.Bottom line, great piece of cinema.  Not quite your typical sex comedy, but it's a good thing we've gone away from the American Pie type of movies and gone back to more witty and classy times.",,Anonymous,Romance
Unexpectedly good comedy movie,"First of all, when I first watched the trailer of the movie I didn't liked it and I didn't had high expectations about it. Eventually, it wasn't as bad as I had imagined and I definitely enjoyed it. The plot of the movie wasn't interesting, nor innovative and it was kinda similar to any other 00's comedy movie. The storyline was kinda well-written and well-explained, even though it was very simple and easy to understand. The characters weren't interesting, but they were well-developed and kinda likeable. I have to admit, it was a very funny movie, full of sex jokes and it wasn't boring, at all. Also, the casting of the movie was nice and their performances were so good. In my opinion, the opening scene was probably the worst part of the movie, because it was slow paced and kinda unnecessary.

"Not a classic, but still decent","This film is a quirky coming-of-age romantic comedy that often flies under the radar. It tells the story of awkward teen Matthew, played by Emile Hirsch, who falls for the new girl next door, Danielle, portrayed by Elisha Cuthbert. Things take a bit of a wild turn when he discovers that she's a former adult film star trying to escape her past. What I likedabout this movie is how it balances humor with heart. It's not just your typical teen rom-com; there's a rawness to it that makes it feel a bit more real. The supporting characters, especially Matthew's goofy friends, add a lot of fun to the mix and keep the laughs coming. Elisha Cuthbert plays the role of the misunderstood girl perfectly, and there's a nice chemistry between her and Hirsch. The film tackles some deeper themes regarding judgment, acceptance, and the complexity of relationships, which is surprisingly refreshing for its genre.While it might not be a classic, it is a charming watch, especially if you're in the mood for something light-hearted with a bit of edge.

"Alisha Cuthbert is sweet, but otherwise...","""American Sexuality"" would be the better title for this movie. This is a movie about and exclusively for Americans that make every European yawn - unless of course he is as ignorant, misinformed and puritan as these strange people from overseas.For the movie completely ignores the problems of his theme. These script authors obviously never read any studies about the psychological problems of real prostitutes and pornstars, they never talked with real people of this field, and they're very far behind with the reality of today pornography as well. For example, nobody makes much money with a single porn movie in the internet age anymore. Reading any serious article about the today reality in any political or feminist media would have told you much more than this picture about the problem.Failing on the educational side, the movie isn't entertaining either. It simply lacks real ideas for the story itself, and most attempts to fill the full 90 minutes for a cinema movie look very artificial and don't support any general story. The Hollywood rule 'the story should fit into two sentences' is not followed at all here. I especially disliked it that this movie has not one ending, but about four or so. At multiple stages of the movie every problem was really solved and the end screen could have popped up. Maybe it had even more endings, after the fourth ending I left the cinema out of boredom.",4.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Fun, easy going, feel good film. A rom com with an edge.","I first watched this movie about a week after it was released in the uk. Initially i was a little worried ""not another rom-com"" but i was more than pleasantly surprised i have to say. I am no denying the teenage roots to the flick, but i am sure that all ages could relate to some parts of the film. High school, the jocks, the geeks the girls. I wasn't going in expecting too much but when i finally pressed the stop button on my DVD at the end of the film i felt happy, and if i'm not very much mistaken that is what these type of film is all about. I didn't expect a shakespearean tragedy instead i got a light, feel - good, slightly adult film.If you like the American pie, road trip, not another teen movie genre of film then you will love this, but i feel there is an edge to this film that those other out and out funny films don't have, there is a definite sentiment that the director tries to portray here and i think he wins. You could watch this film with your friends, girlfriends, boyfriend but perhaps not your parents.If this film doesn't leave you feeling something i'll be surprised. Both the leads are great, and there are subtleties in their performances to look out for.so rent it, buy it and i promise you'll have a chuckle, a chortle, a snigger or even a guffaw.

Danielle (Elisha Cuthbert) is stunning, charming, personable, and she likes Matt. But can she reconcile her past - which is always pulling her back - with his present?At alternate times, I laughed VERY hard and cringed even harder. See, the problem is in the pacing - the director didn't seem sure whether this was supposed to be a slapstick sex comedy or a more serious drama. And that's a huge shame, because some of the scenes in this movie were fantastic, especially the denouement.A huge plus is Cuthbert, who simply lights up every scene she's in with seemingly effortless charisma. Every smile, every time she bit her upper lip, males everywhere got a little sweatier.

Who's the target audience for this R-rated teenybopper film?,"Saw it at a preview screening here in San Francisco last night.  Overall, this movie seemed like an attempt to capitalize on the success of teenybopper romantic comedies but with an added dose of boob-age to warrant an ""R"" rating, both a ""chick flick"" and ""dick flick"", if you will.  The story does seem to drag on though, as the characters manage to get into one predicament after another, with the occasional obstacle coming out of left field, making the movie less fluid.  Each new obstacle seemed calculated to elicit laughs and cringing at the same time.  The Asian stereotype jokes got old pretty fast and the movie seemed like a throwback of the John Hughes-era films, where a majority of the students are White with the occasional token person of color thrown in.  However, the casting was enjoyable, and even Matthew's parents were fun.

Comedy + Drama + Romance = Ultimate Teen Movie,"First off, this film was surprisingly better than i expected, obviously when compared with other teen comedies... why does 'American Pie' come to mind? I did see the trailer before watching the movie because i was rather intrigued with the plot (i also liked the imdb tagline 'he never saw her coming... but all his friends had', genius!). Anyway, to get to the point, the trailer made me chuckle, however, i was expecting the same result as 'American Pie 2'... where the only scenes that were remotely funny made up the trailer. In the end, this wasn't the case and for that alone, the movie does not deserve as much criticism as it has received.The only flaw to the movie i can think of is that Elisha Cuthbert far is too beautiful to be a pornstar but her evident ability to act made the part that bit more believable together with the apparent perception of chemistry between the two leading roles (Hirsch & Cuthbert). Whilst they managed to uphold the romantic and dramatic side of the movie, the inclusion of side characters, most notably Eli (Marquette) and Kelly (Olyphant), brought out a major chunk of the comic influence that had me and others around me laughing non-stop from start to finish. Even the smaller roles (e.g. Samnang) were fully justified by the response they receive rather than the part they play in the development of the storyline.The overall ending was not as predictable as first thought, with the exception of the two main characters winding up together... which can be forgiven as otherwise the first 1hr 30 of the movie would have been completely pointless. There was 1 plot line and for those who thought otherwise, all i can say is you must have been confusing 'The Girl Next Door' with the hotdog tell you to go to the lobby before the movie started along with all the other needless trailers. If there was anything to be upset about it was people laughing at jokes from the trailer... i've never understood why people do that, pretending as though they've never heard the joke before. But i digress to the point of saying that all reviews are merely subjective and we can all expect that this movie is not going to win any oscar's but if i were to pick a teen movie for someone in need of a laugh, this would be without a doubt my choice.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

The main character goes to an exaggerated hyperbolic version of high school in California with cool pretty people pouring out from every orifice--except he and his friends of course. This high school is so generic it's called Westport High School (like West Eastland school in ""Alvin and the Chipmunks"" or Westmore School in ""Diary of a Wimpy Kid"").When the super hot girl next door moves in she pretty much adopts him like a lost puppy and he behaves like an obedient puppy with her as well.

"A Poor Remake of ""Risky Business""","This movie was awful. It's an updated version of the 80's Tom Cruise movie ""Risky Business,"" with Porn Star substituted for Prostitute. The characters are flat, at best, and none are believable. The adult film industry is imagined to be this slapstick type business at some times, and gritty and dirty (but not so much that the lead actress is undesirable for having been ridden like Amtrack)The script writers must have used every predictable cliché in the book. Even the product placement was done poorly. About the only thing positive that can be said this movie did better than the film it so blatantly copied, was to promote safer sex and condom usage, if you're having sex with a high risk partner.The Unrated Version of this movie is possibly worse than the theater screened version - it features a few extra seconds of T&A, and tons of stuff that was rightfully edited out for the sake of not having the theater audience gouge out their eyeballs.",4.0,Anonymous,Romance

Danielle is a free spirited girl who tries to break Matthew out of his shell. Matthew discovers that in life you may have to risk everything for the girl you love.  The school scenes will bring back memories of the stupid things that were done during our high school days.

"Funny, Yet Forgettable","The movie is good or at least not bad. It could've been much better though, if not for the stupid story. It is really silly. There are a lot of dumb, but funny movies out there, but this one had potential. I mean, a high school graduate falling in love with a porn star was actually nice idea. It could've become a very romantic, inspiring movie, but the director apparently decided to emphasize the comic aspect of the picture, thus sacrificing character development & general credibility. The jokes, to tell the truth, are not hilarious either. They are likely to bring a smile up on your face & keep it throughout the movie, but you ain't gonna be laughing your head off.What saves this movie is outstanding acting! Such a wonderful performance by the cast alone makes The Girl Next Door worth watching. The on-screen chemistry between Emile Hirsch & Elisha Cuthbert is undoubtful. James Remar is charismatic as usual & Timothy Olyphant is almost perfect. The funniest role is played incredibly successfully by Chris Marquette, who at times steals the show completely.I'd like also to mention the great soundtrack, which totally suites the movie & is I think worth purchasing.In the end, this sappy comedy is likely to improve your mood & you'll probably enjoy great acting. Yet, this is not what it could be & it's far from being a mandatory entity in one's DVD or VHS collection.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Sex is funny... I suppose,"I think that's what this movie was implying, but I'm not quite sure. Why? It might have something to do with the fact that this quote-unquote film was utterly lacking in anything that makes a good movie. Characters we care about? Nah. A plot that engrossed me and brought me into the world of the characters? Nope. Anything remotely funny? Nada. Zip, zero, zilch.On the other hand, it does have nudity. I'll give it that. And it can keep it, as far as I'm concerned.The Girl Next Door details the misadventures of a high school senior when he discovers that his new next-door neighbor was once... a porn star! Gasp! The horror! The kid tries to hook up with her, and his goofy friends tag along, and she brings some of her porno pals, yadda yadda yadda. The ""yadda yadda yadda"" is in there because once you understand the basic outline of this flick, you won't need to watch it. You'll know what's going to happen. You know there'll be comical sexual misunderstandings, that the geeky friends are going to try and get laid, and that an evil guy from her past is trying to get her back into the ""business"".Unless you like jokes about sex, body parts, and other wonderful things that make teenagers go ""Awesome,"" you'll probably enjoy this movie.

Cleverly exaggerated,"It's been interesting to see the reaction to this film. From what I can tell the two main criticisms are 1)that it rips off the teen-comedies of the 80s and 2) that it deals too lightly with porn-related issues. It's first important to note that films that simply rehash a tested formula can be accused of ""ripping off"" whereas a film which borrows elements but reworks them in a new and creative way, paying homage to their predecessors but taking the genre into new directions is certainly not ripping them off. It's wonderful to see high school life dealt with so intelligently while staying entertaining and fresh.I watched this with my girl-friend who is very concerned with the whole porn industry and how the actresses are treated. But she couldn't see what was so offensive about the way they were portrayed in this film. The film isn't making a statement about the porn industry, it's talking about growing up.

"Went into this not expecting too much, but...","The Girl Next Door is now a favorite movie in the teen genre.Initially I was going to rate this a 7 but there are great plot twists that sneak up on you just when you think you know where it is going; so in all fairness this movie gets the 8 for not standing idly in cliché land.Emile Hirsch, Elisha Cuthbert and Timothy Olyphant gel nicely as the leads. There were many laugh out loud moments including the AVN convention and the prom, but the awards dinner was possibly the best (tie scene and dancing).While Emile and Elisha produce good chemistry and provide the plot foundation, it is the antagonistic relationship between Emile (Matt) and Timothy (Kelly) that keep you loving this movie. I could watch another movie based on these two alone.The supporting cast of nerd friends serve the film well and provide excellent comedic relief.On pondering what changes would make this movie rate as 9-10, I am still unsure because pushing the boundaries further might also push the movie too far across the absurdity line. However The Hangover was absurd and that was great fun, so I'll stick with the rating of 8.It's unfair to label this movie as just a teen comedy because its got more juice and more squeeze than most.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Its alright.,"What i expect from teenage comedies is nudity, fart jokes and people crashing into things and falling over. don't get me wrong, i like good movies, but i wanted to watch something stupid and relax and instead i got this movie, filled with emotions and touchy feely scenes. Its fun, there are memorable characters and the story goes pretty well to places unseen before. Its just not what you'd expect. I would have loved it more with a few more laughs and a story not entirely focused on two people madly in love and then painfully split up and then getting back together and all that. The cast was great, watching this movie after watching Into the wild really put my focus on Emile and i came to realize why he remained popular and re-cast as he is a pretty good actor. His love interest, played by Elisha is also a great cast- but so is the rest of the crew. Soundtrack fits perfectly into the scenes and is well done. To sum it all up- its a different kind of teen-comedy, more on the feelings and the stupid things kids do for love. I'm just to skeptic to believe in all of it.

To be honest, I'd rather watch this than ""American Pie"". ""American Pie"" was very gross. This has it's moments. So, I would recommend to anyone above the age of 18.

Yeah there was the gratuitous nudity but with a porn star as one of the leads that is inevitable. This movie had heart and soul, there were really good leads played well by all. Timothy Olyphant as the porn producer was the highlight of the movie for me at least, he hasn't been in too many movies where I actually liked his acting so that was definitely awesome to see one of my favorite television actors finally playing a good role. Emile Hirsch is one of my favorite young actors so I've been waiting to see this for a while , and he definitely didn't disappoint, totally different than any other role he has played.

Timothy Olyphant was great as always, and Emile Hirsch did a fine job in his first major role.

Teenage fantasy bogged down by cliches,"Let's face it, this is mainly an unashamed sex fantasy aimed at frustrated teenage boys. Why didn't this movie come when I was a teenager myself? If it had I would have given it a perfect ten. Now I'm not so generous, probably because I can't stand all things we've seen a hundred times in other teenage flicks.But let's begin with the good: for us boys, there's lots and lots of nice views in this movie! Elisha Cuthbert as Danielle is probably the most beautiful and sexy actresses gracing the silver screen today. Even if we don't get any frontal nudity from this future superstar, we see a bit more of Danielle's porn star friends ;-) You girls will also get your share though: Timothy Olyphant as Kelly has a rock star charisma that I think few girls will be able to resist. For girls that don't find dangerous men sexy there's always Emile Hirsch as Matt, although I don't see any star quality in him personally.The plot was quite different from what I expected, which is a good thing. I certainly like to be surprised, but that's why I got so annoyed by all the cliches that are still left. Yes, there will be standing ovations when love is declared and yes, it all ends with a magical prom night. Some of these scenes made me cringe in my seat and certainly hurt my enjoyment.

Gives you a real shock!!!,Right up until the moment it turns quite serious this just seems like your average romantic comedy. But all of sudden without any real warning it becomes serious and throws you right back. I think it was quite a clever technique used by the director because it certainly stopped me from drifting away as I tend to do in movies like this. The rest of the movie is quite good delivering a good moral and a nice little twist at the end. The acting was above par on the whole and the movie moved around constantly not allowing itself to drift which most romantic comedies tend to do.So overall worth checking out but don't expect to be left breathless after wards (maybe if anything from Elisha Cuthbert).,8.0,Anonymous,Romance

She must have had 5 or 6 new clothes new make-ups new hair styles, that was a little anoyng to say at least, i felt it was on fast forward. Emille Hirsch acted great too, not that he had much of a hard work to do.

The finest example of how a film can be superbly funny and amazingly sweet,"A teen movie is not ususally my sort of film, but I like a good comedy and Elisha always brights up a man's day so I decided to give it a whirl. The premise is typical teen plot but the script is far more real (if you ignore the ex porn star moving in next door) than any other. It deals with first love in a way that is so personal that i defy anyone not to be touched by some of the moments in the film. The acting is spot on with Elisha and Emile showing an innocence that is necessary to stop the characters from becoming seedy and desperate. Although these two shine the stand out character and acting is by Timothy Olyphant, the villain of the piece. There are moments in the film where the comedy is kicked out of the park and you have to check again that you haven't flicked over to a psycho movie. But even he has some redeeming features. This movie is an example to all the EuroTrips and Old Schools out there who think crude is funny all the time and that's all you need in a film.

This movie has appeal even for the untargeted demographic,"When I first saw the trailer for this movie, I simply groaned. Why oh why would Elisha Cuthbert put herself in a movie like this after taking part in an awesome program like 24. Well, now I know. As a Deadwood fan, I've been tracing the earlier work of all of its brilliant actors, including Timothy Olyphant. Which brought me back to this movie.I was far from disappointed. In fact, I really got a kick out of it. Olyphant plays his part spot on--scene stealing as everyone is saying. (I have to imagine the Deadwood casting directors must've seen this performance.) Also, being unfamiliar with Emile Hirsch, I was impressed with his range and realness. Looking forward to more from him. It was good too, to see Elisha in a different kind of role from 24. Her character, though not deeply developed, is an important catalyst for the story... and your heart goes out to her inner sweetness.Final point. In his commentary, the director mentions that his target demographic was thirty-somethings and younger. That's definitely not me--female 49er. But as long as you're not dead, nor flustered by a degree of sleazy humor, and have some memories of high school, you might very well enjoy this movie. I put it in there with the... ""Yeah, it won't win the major awards, but it makes me smile."" On that note, I've added it to my DVD collection of smallish, fun, heartfelt movies like Happy Texas and Tin Cup.",,Anonymous,Romance

Ignore any preconceived ideas of what this film is about (the trailers etc are very misleading) and go in with an open mind and hopefully you'll see what i mean.Yes there are some very stupid scenes in the film but they are few and far between, and most of the humor comes from believable exchanges between the characters. But i hardly even see this film as a comedy, because underneath that Matt (Emile Hirsch) and Danielle (Elisha Cuthbert) share a love that is more real and honest than any i have seen before. The characters seem to truly be in love, rather than just actors playing a role. (A scene that really shows this is the emotion shown by Danielle when Matt asks her to prom).In addition to the actors remarkable performances (another stand out one being Timothy Olyphant in the role of a porn producer) there is also a very strong script, which manages (for the most part) to be genuinely funny while still seeming real and passionate.Finally the soundtrack is outstanding providing brilliant songs that are perfect for the scene throughout.Overall i give this film 10 out of 10, and highly recommend you go and see it, just remember to keep an open mind.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

Elisha Cuthbert does a great job and definitely acts well as a sexy, porn star. Overall, the movie was just plain great! Always know if the juice is worth the squeeze, and trust me this movie is worth watching.I highly recommend this movie.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
"See ""Risky Business"" instead.","While mildly entertaining, this movie is far from original. It was almost a complete remake of ""Risky Business"". The plot is almost identical. Substitute porn-star for call girl, agent for pimp. The themes are the same. A fair number of the lines are either the same or very close to the same. A lot of the cinematography was the same.If you hadn't seen or heard of Risky Business, this movie would probably strike you a lot better than it got me. But if you liked The Girl Next Door, be sure to check out Risky Business. Tom Cruise and Rebecca DeMornay played the precursors to Matthew and Danielle. Joe Pantoliano played an amazing ""Guido the Pimp"". It is a much better movie, in my opinion.5/10, if only because this movie came out in 1983 with a better cast and under a different title.",,Anonymous,Romance

Most Misunderstood Movie I Have Ever Seen,"First off this movie was one of the worse marketed movies by a studio ever. They made it out to be a teen sex comedy which it is truly not. It has its laughs but this movie is so much more.The movie is about repression and then having that repression broken once you fall in love for the first time. Matthew is a kid who has never taken a risk in his life and has always done the thing people expected of him. Enter Danielle, the girl next door, who just gets Matthew is so many ways. She releases him from the binds that have enclosed him all his life and as the movie goes along we see what love is in its finest form. These characters really are in love and the actors who play them (Emile Hirsch and Elisha Cuthbert) play their performances to perfection, especially Cuthbert.All and all i will recommend this movie to anyone. It is truly the new Risky Business.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

"Trashy comedy, the way only Hollywood can produce it.","Typical idiotic teen rom-com from the world-(in)famous trash factory based in L. A., a moronic and unfunny male fantasy full of cheesy and cringy por$no plots and characters, plus the obligatory, tiresome, and utterly unfunny high-school cliches and stereotypes.Elisha Cuthbert is the only good thing about this junk. I am no longer surprised that trash such as this is so popular among the dum$ed-down. The number of fried brains outnumbers the functional ones by at least 100 to 1.That's an optimistic estimate.Overlong too, with numerous unnecessary sub-plots which tend to distract from the (lousy) humour.

"2 Reviews, 11 Years Apart - NOSTALGIA","I felt compelled to review this movie after watching it last night on Netflix after 11 years...
2010 - Movies like this were still being churned out during the golden age of American Sex Comedies & Coming of Age genres, categories of film which would seemingly die out as social constructs changed, and cultures evolved.Films such as American Pie, or Road Trip, or The Girl Next Door provided a great deal of escapism for many young folks including myself - Oh to experience some of the suburban Americana stereotypes: Sorority/fraternity parties, heading to the beach after or even during class, large houses on peaceful and leafy streets, all the mums are milfs and all the girls are hot. Quintessential scenes in these films where women would reveal their assets after some drunken game or dare... you didn't know exactly when it was coming, you just knew it was! Sex was new, funny, exploratory, intriguing.Let's add Elisha Cuthbert to this mix as Danielle - she's perfection in this film, every young mans dream woman. Her cuteness and facial expressions are almost overwhelming, her natural features somewhat angelic - Everyone watching at this point has assumed the role of Emile Hirsch's, Matthew, boys and girls alike, and no one actually has a choice... at this point they we've been hypnotised. Danielle is so excruciatingly yet nonchalantly beautiful that you wonder how to find this woman in life - you're jealous of Matthew, you want this exact scenario to happen to you! It hurts that it hasn't
The movie rolls on and at this point I didn't care much about the things I usually do when I analyse a film: the cinematography, the direction, the acting, mis en scene etc. I'm just too enamoured with the relationship between the main characters, I'm enthralled with the escapism.I watch the film several times in search for that same level of escapism.2021 - I had thought about this film from time to time over several years however wasn't particularly interested in covering old ground from years before - I saw it pop up on Netflix and decided to put it on... what I then experienced was extreme nostalgia for a least the first half of the film.I found myself in a bittersweet state of mind, yearning for a time that once was, when things were easier, when time was on my side, when the inevitable pressures and stresses of life hadn't yet kicked in.This film will remain a cult classic in my opinion due to Danielle and Matthews relationship - Matthew is a handsome guy but Danielle was breath-taking, however re-watching this film with a more critical head, it could have been an exceptional film if the romantic story had expanded more dramatically rather than comedically - due to the teen movie element, some of the comedic elements had to rely on increasingly implausible scenes to allow the juvenile jokes to work - the second half of the film in particular is extraordinarily nonsensical which removes some of the nuanced sweetness previously developed by the characters.However, the movie pretty much had to be made the way it was, it was a sign of the times... only watching again now provides a particular level of nostalgia that we might not otherwise have had.So, in essence, this film is not actually very technically good, however it doesn't need to be... this is one of those films which gives you a feeling rather than having to critically analyse - in my case nostalgia.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

Extremely Likable,"I turned to HBO to find that the Girl Next Door was just starting, so i decided to watch it, and I have to say it has been a long time since i have watched such an appealing and affable movie. Due to the way it was marketed, before I watched it it made me think it would be a big striptease movie, but it really just was not that. I found myself becoming attached to the two main characters Matthew and Danielle, as if I had always known them. They are both especially appealing actors in this ""not so much for children"" comedy. It does not matter if it was good or not, I simply found myself content and satisfied when it finished like I never had been before, and I am not a sucker for romantic peachy movies as this one may be marketed as, in fact I don't even watch many romantic comedies. Definitely worth renting for your own pleasure, great movie, very hard to describe how exactly, but rent it, most definitely.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Watch this movie, ESPECIALLY if you know little about it.","There are few moments in life where something vastly exceeds your expectations. This movie was one of those things. I saw that this movie was playing on TV and thought that I might as well check it out. I remember seeing commercials for the movie as a young boy, and since then I have always assumed it was just a sex comedy. I'm sure that is what almost everyone thought about the movie honestly. Let me just say one thing; the marketing for this movie really missed the boat. This movie is so much more than a sex comedy; in fact, while being both sexy and funny, I don't think that ""The Girl Next Door"" fits into that genre. It gives you such a genuinely good feeling when you watch it, it's great. It really reminds you of ""Risky Business"" when you watch it, both technically and in the plot. I have to say, however, that despite loving Risky Business, I love this movie more. Maybe it's because I'm going through a time in my life similar to this movie, but it really is incredible. The acting, music and plot are all perfect. Just watch it, trust me",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Wildly uneven with plot and continuity problems,"The male lead, Cuthbert and the porno pimp, oops, I mean ""producer"", are the best things about this film. They are all likeable. However, the plot line is so implausible and has such huge holes in it that you only have to stop from time to time and ask yourself, ""how come....?"" to realize that nothing adds up. Whenever the problems become too glaring the film resorts to a little dash of T&A or blue dialogue to distract the viewer from noticing and, judging by the generally favourable reviews on this site, it worked.For me, a movie has to have some basis in reality or plausability to be truly funny. As a secondary issue, I was a little disturbed about the basic premise that a porn movie career is a valid choice for a girl supposedly only 18 or 19 years old. Not only valid but apparently a laugh riot too.",3.0,Anonymous,Romance

The line between sexy and sleazy is so thin.,"When it comes to most teen flicks one should always remember to set brain activity knob to LOW and expect a steady amount of crap. However, that knowledge couldn't remotely prepare me for the pile of excrement that is this movie.It was nauseating!Unoriginal plot, badly executed story and brain cell killin' script aside, it's the overall obnoxiously smutty atmosphere that is the most offputting aspect of this mess.Successful morphosis of ""American Pie"" and ""Risky Business"" was obviously the goal here (it even says so on the DVD box), but, boy, did they miss the target. As dopey as those flicks are, they pretty well seem like masterpieces in comparison to ""The Girl Next Door"". They at least dealt with sex and innuendo in a cheerful manner, whereas here everything is so sleazy and devoid of any fun.Avoid at all costs.PS: Elisha Cuthbert, the chick playing the title role, became semi-known on a Canadian show 'Popular Mechanics for Kids' where she played a smart goody-two-shoes with all the answers, but in taking this role she became a victim of some terrible career advice.Perhaps the thinking was that she's certainly hot enough physically to join the likes of Lindsay Lohan, Hillary Duff, Olson twins and other Hollywood jail baits being worshiped by teenyboppers and middle-aged pervs the world over - and no quarrel there - however, instead of being catapulted into their echelon she will, likely forever, be banished down to the Elizabeth Berkley territory. Releasing a home-made sex tape would've probably done about the same amount of damage to her long term Hollywood career as this squalid stinker likely will.",2.0,Anonymous,Romance
A Pleasant Surprise,"I really expected this to be awful, clichéd and embarrassing....BUT, this turned out to be a pleasant surprise.Whilst strictly a teen-movie(in premise at least) there is a fair amount of nudity and swearing to lift this out of the cheese-factor. Emil Hirsch is an amiable male lead, while Elisha Cuthbert looks far more beautiful here than she ever did in '24', although it's interesting that she looks better when appearing natural, than when dolled up as a porn-starlet. Timothy Olyphant adds a certain menacing charm to proceedings by apparently playing a watered-down version of the character he plays in 'Go'.All in all a pretty good little movie that deserves better than the lukewarm reviews it got upon it's release.

"Hi, I'm ""The Girl Next Door"" and I'm rated R.","Now I'm not a pervert or nothing, but usually when a movie is rated R it goes for the throat.  If I had to give this simply average movie a rating, I'd give it ""half R"", meaning that half the movie had guts and the other half had none.  I believe the movie was written by a schizophrenic (however you spell it).  Some days, he would be raunchy and uninhibited.  He used the great premise to his advantage.  And some days, he was a big wussy.  He wimped out and made chessy scenes seen in hundreds of other movies (c'mon pal, I saw an ecstacy trip in BAD BOYS II).Tim Olyphant was the best character, but he dried out near the end.  Elisha Cuthbert was sexy.  The Tripod (as they're called in the film) were good, too.  I just wish this film would've stayed in one direction, you know? First, the girl next door's a former porn star.  Great!  Wait, now it's about friendship.  Okay, but... porn star?  Yes?  No?  Yeah, ex-porn star and friendship.  WHAT?  Kid from the Orient?

GO WITH IT...,"It's hard to explain The Girl Next Door and why it's such a great film. But trust me it is, and go see it. It's 100 percent fantastic. I went into the film with mediocre expectations at best. But this film completely exceeded them. I could have gone in with high expectations and still been completely satisfied but going in with slighter expectations has left me completely astounded everything about this film screams professionalism. As it starts off with a collage of High School life done to yearbook pictures and nostalgic music of mostly anyones childhood. it's the feelings it brings forth that inspires memory and classic nostalgia. your only wishing at this point that the film could keep up this feeling through out it and does it one better and creates something completely original, somewhat magical and totally believable.  But as for the films plot which is filled with more depth that you can hardly imagine. It opens with a young man whom is questioning his HS years and their lack of enertaining memorabilia. Than enters the girl next door a young woman played by the beautiful and completed talented Elisa Cushbert of 24 and she is a stunner believe me when I say that. He meets her, she meets him issues ensue and she decides to give him the memories he's in search of just because of the innocent way he looks at her. But she has a secret you see she's no ordinary girl she's actually a porn star whom just quit her job trying to find a more suitable and respectful career. One she has settled into because a lack of better choices and because of the way she's always been treated. Now with the synopsis I am gonna completely stop there because to give anymore away would be wrong and if I did you'd probably be like what the hell is this? and never see it. But trust me it's worth any price you would pay and completely worth a viewing. The film is completely layered and three dimensional. It's beautifully written and the characters and their performances are smart and sexy. Although the film appears to be a sex comedy it's that  sex appeal that it usues to draw you in and than drops you over on it to teach the audience an apporpriate and heartfelt lesson. With all the cliches and silliness pushed to the absent side. The performances, direction and writing are all inspiring and you can expected to see these talented faces and names headline cinema for years to come. This film rocks it's almost everything you could want of in a movie. As it moves along it gets better. And when it ends your completely satisfied and you will carry a well deserved smile through the entire day following and whenever you decide to discuss it. Intelligent, provocative, sexy, funny, dramtic, emotions these are all things that describe this film but I'll use the credo that one character lives by and passes it on to others. Who cares what people think just go with it!!!! And run out and see this.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

teenager graduating learns the true meaning of respect for another person,"When I first rented this movie, I was actually expecting to watch another usual teen comedy, but, what I wound up seeing was the 2006 version of how a boy who is graduating learns the real meaning of how to respect another person. When we first meet the young boy, he hangs out with a not so popular crowd and seems very frustrated by it. One evening while taking out the garbage, he winds up meeting his new next neighbour, ""the girl next door"" and he falls in love with her at first sight because she is physically beautiful. After he accidentally sees her without her top on, they actually wind up going out for the evening, and that is when the true meaning of a relationship starts up between them. She actually starts showing him how to have respect for a girl, and this wonderful message actually becomes the basis for the whole story. The two actually have a real chemistry together. The movie itself winds up giving out the wonderful message to the youth of today and tomorrow that if you don't respect another person, you don't know what a real relationship is. The movie itself is a real ""classic"" in my opinion for this reason and that is why I am glad to have it in my DVD collection. I would honestly consider this to be a real modern day ""cinderella story"" and I really hope to see Hollywood making more of these types of films, because honestly, these are the types of films that dreams are made of.The movie itself also has a lot of good laughs in it.

Waste of time. I paused it many times for stupid reasons.,"I didn't really liked this film. It's about a teenage boy and a young porn star and they fall in love each other, but her job is a huge problem and he's trying to help her get out of this.Okay, I don't really understand how could someone think of this storyline. Its plot is so random, that unfortunately, can't really write a review.Again, there's a high schooler, that wants to give scholarship to a really genius poor boy, so the school collect some money. Then, the same boy, falls in love with his neighbour, a young porn star by watching her getting undressed. Of course he belongs to a nerd squad and she's out of his league and he's a virgin, but OF COURSE, she falls for him back. The problem is her job and her silly manager. Our protagonist tries really hard to help her getting out of this, but her manager is money-freak, so it's not easy and then we have a non-pormographic amateur film about the value of protection.See? Is there any point of this film? For me, certainly not! I can't rate it higher. It really gave me nothing.Protection is really important, scholarships are also, but their presentation is very prosaic. And I don't mean that it should have been a drama, because of these topics, but a comedy with smarter script and storyline.I paused it many times for really no reason. I started watching it at 15:00, but I finished it at 19:00.

When he begins dating his new next door neighbour Danielle, he discovers that she is a former porn star and it throws his life off balance as a series of disturbing events begin to plague him. What I like about The Girl Next Door is that when you look at the cover or see the trailers, it looks like a raunchy sex comedy like American Pie. However, when you watch it you'll see that it's got some very funny moments, but also some touching dramatic moments. It has a really good story that separates it from other teen comedies.All of the actors in this movie do a really good job. Emile Hirsch, who I'd never heard of before this really impressed me with his acting skill. He definitely has the potential to move on to greater things. I've seen Elisha Cuthbert in different things like Popular Mechanics for Kids and Are You Afraid of the Dark, but this is her breakout film. Not to mention that she is one of the most smoking hot actresses in Hollywood today, but that's besides the point. She plays her role really well. Timothy Olyphant is hilarious as Danielle's manager.Another good thing about The Girl Next Door is that if you look beyond just the movie, you'll see the film actually has useful messages. Overall, this movie is above and beyond any other teen comedy, and everyone involved deserves congratulations on a job well done.8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

One of the most enjoying teen comedies...,"Saying that, the film should not exactly be confined into the name of 'teen flick'. Thanks to Greenfield's excellent handling with the characters and the innovative smart script, the film explores a lot into character development. The characters are not at all stereotypical as expected in such films. Gradual changes that came into them were finely portrayed by the actors too, especially Emile Hirsch. Another accomplishment for the film is that it was able to produce some 'sweet grace' in its romantic atmosphere. Simply, I considered the film multi-dimensional. Clearly the film wasn't intended to be marketed that way.Considering the plot and the storyline, I admit there had to be some clichés. It was never Greenfield's intention to make an art film with this plot after all. But he handles sex and nudity in brilliant mastery to make it suitable for teenagers. The basic story may be inspired by ""Risky Business"" but there were touches of Greenfield's innovative thinking and smart plot twists everywhere.And Elisha Cuthbert has everything the viewers' masculine urges can possibly wish for. Besides giving us the best visual treat possible under a no-nudity contract, she also gives a nice performance. Keeping in mind her talent, the screenwriters could explore her character a bit more in my opinion, like her background. Yet she makes it sure that people who like this film would follow her career quite earnestly afterwards.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

Then he meets the girl next door and all hell breaks loose.""The Girl Next Door"" is the type of film that gently breaks down the door of a genre. Take your typical teen comedy with geeks hanging out in the A/V room, guys being obsessed with meeting porn stars, with some contrived plot which allows for breasts galore and lots of lame sex jokes. But this film sees that bet and raises it. It has your geeks obsessed with meeting porn stars, but it also has an actually well-written good comedy story, which then allows for breasts galore and some mild sex jokes.Emile Hirsch is the perfect actor for the role of Matt. He's handsome so women will love to watch him, but not too handsome that men will want to watch him too. After this, his peers started watching him and he's been getting accolades for his talent.""The Girl Next Door"" is for everybody getting frustrated with the poor state of teen comedies. You can watch this without hanging your head in shame.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
The most underrated movie of all time!,"I first saw this movie in the summer of 2007 and to say I was amazed is an understatement! When the movie was originally released I wasn't particularly interested as I felt that it was just another teen movie (excuse the pun) and I wasn't thrilled by the trailer or tag-line as I thought it made the movie sound dirty and cliché ridden.Then I watched it... and watched it again, and again and again... I immediately fell in love with this movie (and the beautiful Elisha Cuthbert) and couldn't stop thinking about it for a week! The lead actors are sweet and believable and the soundtrack is perfect.This is a perfect example of the phrase ""don't judge a book by its cover"" and I would recommend this film to anybody. The storyline is very sweet and sincere with a fair amount of comedy thrown in the mix.Every actor plays a perfect part in this movie. Emile Hirsch plays the perfect innocent straight A over-achiever and Elisha Cuthbert is very sweet and extremely likable and doesn't play the stereotypical ""girl next door"". Timothy Olyphant plays the perfect supporting role who is likable as well as coming across as the kind of guy you don't want to mess with! This is one of my favourite movies of all time just for its pure entertainment and feel factor. It is a very sweet love story with genuine comedy sprinkled on top of it. I don't expect people to share the same views as me about this film but I would recommend giving it a go and not judging it before you watch it!",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
80's rehash is mostly Spam,"Generally pointless, often asinine, sporadic rip-off of 80's conservative/yuppie wet dream flick, Risky Business finds the enterprising teens moving from using women as prostitutes to get into college to using women in porno videos to get into college. Ahh, to be young, affluent, white and American! The storyline is largely far-fetched as are the irritatingly clichéd characterizations which include the clueless and zany parents, clueless and irritating teachers, horny and supposedly funny friends and a squeaky clean ""looking for love only"" leading man.Barely saving the film from its smirking self awareness (it seems to think it has a clever script) and gross commodity fetish politics are the curiously charming and sexy performances of the two leads, handsome Emile Hirsh and gorgeous Elisha Cuthbert. Both of them really should be lending their talents elsewhere as should the always dependable heel Timothy Olyphant (standing in for Guido the Killer pimp from Risky Business). They keep you interested in the nonsense unfolding which is more than this cheap, self important and finally vulgar teen comedy deserves.A word to those who think that excessive use of 1980's music (which truly most of these characters wouldn't know) and using key plot devices from Risky Business are somehow HOMAGE to 80's teen films... it's not homage.. it's called RIP OFF or as they say in L.A. a ""re-imaginging of a hit"".In spite of the leads charms, neither her curves or his handsome backside can save this tiresome rubbish.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance
A Personal favourite of mine,"The Girl Next Door is probably my favourite film for many reasons. Firstly, I can relate to Matthew's character. Second, there a tons of quotable lines that could be you can use, without many people knowing where you got them from, and it also highly lives up to it's ""Romantic Comedy"" status (although quite different to normal Rom Coms), with a nice twist at the ending.Matthew Kidman (played by Emile Hirsch) is in his senior year of High School. He tries to writing what he'll ""Always remember"" about High School, but quickly realises that he has nothing to write about. Later on, whilst he is taking the trash out and practising his speech for a scholarship to Georgetown, he notices a girl, Danielle (played by Elisha Cuthbert), who he instantly falls for. Later, she catches him looking at her getting undressed, to which she seemingly angrily goes round to his house to tell his parents. However, this is just the start, as she pushes him to do things ""He never thought he could do"", and gives him something to remember about High School. She, however, has a dark past, which threatens their relationship when Matthew finds out.I am giving this film an easy 10/10. You would probably struggle to find another Rom Com like this one. Some people may call this film ""Strange"", and it is a bit, I suppose, but there is definitely a sort of uniqueness to it, that separates it from films like ""Love Actually"" and ""The Holiday"".Should you watch it once? Yes. Should you watch it again? Yes. Should you watch it for a college project? If you want to. It's your life, after all (just don't say that TheDoctorAnd suggested to do it if you do).",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Wishes it were the next American Pie,"This is a pretty dumb and unoriginal teen sex comedy that seems content to just rip off Risky Business and American Pie without developing a personality of its own. Most of the plot twists you can see coming from miles away and the humor is strictly lowbrow. The cast isn't too bad and Elisha Cubert and Sung Hi Lee are easy on the eyes, but the storyline just gets so ridiculous so that you don't really care about anyone by the end.

What Every Guy Dreams Of,"This movie is exactly what every guy dreams of when he is in high school. Being rich, famous, and having a hot girlfriend.

I watched that when I was in high school and found it to be extremely funny and now as I am older I watch this and see the same formula and even believe this movie to be better. They found perfect group of actors/actresses to fill in the parts.  The soundtrack also fits accordingly and complements the scenes nicely.  If you are looking for a movie that you and all your friends will enjoy and be talking about for days to come then this it.  One word of caution, it is rated R for a reason.

Worth the price of admission.,"One of the key elements to making a memorable film is knowing your demographic.In the 1980's no film maker demonstrated this ability with greater savy than John Hughes. His films not only launched careers and packed in box office receipts; they also spoke to a generation and helped define a cadre of actors who, to this day, still dominate their profession.In 2004, its hard to say exactly who to consider when awarding the title of heir-apparent. `The girl next door' director, Luke Greenfield, seems to have crafted a gem that's worth the price of admission. But this relative unknown, whose previous efforts included Rob Schneiders 2001 effort, `The Animal', is also working with a strong script and well cast talent.One of the underlying themes of `The girl next door' deals with the idea of updating school teaching material, an interesting thought given that the film itself can be considered much in the same way. The cast comment on how `Someone should update these films', while viewing an outdated sex-ed movie from the 1950's. `The girl next door' is as updated, in comparison, as its counter parts, `The Breakfast Club', `Sixteen Candles' and `Weird Science'.Young stars, Emile Hirsch (The Emperors Club, 2001) and Elisha Cuthbert (Old School, 2003) both give credible performances and may very well look back fondly one day on this film as a ground breaking performance in their respective careers. Timothy Olyphant (Rockstar, 2001, Dreamcatcher, 2003) is likewise, both easily hateable, yet roguishly charming (a la `Han Solo') in his role as Hirsch's tough ex-boyfriend/boss.Crafted by individuals who obviously recognize that this generation accept sex and nudity without the hang-ups of the Hughes generation, `The girl next door' speaks expertly and with a cunning tone that, while it probably won't see any Oscars, may give Greenfield the first sleeper hit of the year.Ivan Mulkeen Toronto, ON",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
The Marketing of the Movie,"Having already complained how the Producers of the film have marketed The Girl Next Door...being a ""movie for a new generation,"" I'd like to complain about their recent television advertisement. The movie is marketing ""real"" teenagers being interviewed at the movies, that are calling their friends on their cell phones to let them know about the movie. This is amazing! I mean, the advertisement wouldn't lie to us and hire LA based actors to portray ""real"" teenagers...would they? And wow! The television advertisements for the Passion of the Christ didn't have people calling their friends and family members. And that movie is the most talked about and successful film this decade. The Girl Next Door must be a better movie and something worth talking about......give me a break. The Studios who made The Girl Next Door produced a pop cultured piece of junk...marketing it that way and not the ""second coming."" Thank you",5.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Perfect, In Its Way","Don't believe the naysayers.  The Girl Next Door is a very good teen sex comedy/coming of age movie.  It doesn't exactly transcend this, but so what--it isn't trying to.I guess the closest movie comparison I can make to this is Risky Business, but--though I haven't seen that movie in years--I felt like there was a much stronger emotional core to this movie than Tom Cruise's first big break.Emile Hirsch, as Matt, and Elisha Cuthbert, as Danielle, are both appealing leads in this film, both visually and emotionally.  They come across as likable and real, not cardboard cutouts of the ""bad girl"" or the ""overachiever"" that we're used to seeing in movies of this sort.  Those moments exist, but they're there for comedy as much as anything else. What really surprised me was that I could actually imagine these two people falling for each other ... though, I suppose I should say the surprise was more that I could see why Danielle might fall for Matt.  As played here, he's a genuinely good guy who doesn't know amazing he really is.  There's a quiet scene where he's explaining to Danielle how ""we"" raised money to bring a brilliant Cambodian student to study in America.  She asks, ""Who's we?"", and when Matt answers that it was basically him, there's a shrug and a kind of sense that he sees it as no big deal--wouldn't anyone have raised the money to help?  It's subtle and beautifully done.The rest of the cast shines as well; there are no weak links.  Tim Olyphant, as Danielle's producer, is at turns both cool and sleazy as hell, and both fit his character like a rhinestone glove.  He has some hilarious moments here, and takes full advantage of them.  Paul Dano, as Klitz, is probably given the least to do, but he plays the reluctant, geeky friend extremely well, and the scene where he finally cuts loose is priceless.  James Remar does a good job of looking and acting like Hugh Hefner as he plays Tim Olyphant's old partner.  And finally, Chris Marquette's Eli is a work of genius.  He's The Girl Next Door's Jack Black, Jason Lee and Vince Vaughan (think Trent from Swingers) rolled into one and then reverse-aged to a high school student so that his presence doesn't seem completely out of place. His lines are some of the funniest and most outrageous in the movie, and he delivers them with spot-on accuracy.Please don't dismiss this movie as simply another teen sex comedy.  It's at least as funny as the American Pie movies (without having to resort to gross out humor as the linchpin of the movie), and it has ten times the heart and soul.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Laugh & Cringy,See I did not think this movie was good at all except is made me laugh through the whole thing and I do not know if that was the purpose but that's all I got out of it. The plot is crazy and the second half is all over the place and feels like it turns into a different movie all together. I do not take this as a serious romantic movie especially with that ending which makes no sense on how they could get away with something like that and I don't think any business man would have made that deal because it breaks laws. So overall hilarious movie but has no serious parts if you ask which brings it down and the parts that weren't funny were just cringe worthy and that about all this movie is.,5.0,Anonymous,Romance
Unexpected Pleasure,"I didn't expect anything out of this movie, and that was perhaps why I think it was simply great. The wonderful soundtrack helped to gel a decently well thought of plot that carried so much nostalgia with it. The best was perhaps the beginning yearbook picture scene, the director made a great attempt at capturing the audience's memories of the past. I actually thought the chemistry between the two leads were wonderful compared to other teen movies, it reminded me of the high school romances, and made me yearn for what they had. The ending was the only thing that was not up to par, because it is simply too perfect. Of course that's what everyone wants to see but I thought the scene with him in the Z4 and seeing Elisha was too too too perfect. Maybe I'm jealous, but this was a great movie",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
A Great Surprise,"On paper this film doesn't sound all that good. Read the cast list. Elisha Cuthbert didn't exactly bowl me over in 24. Not exactly who'd you expect to play a former porn star. Everyone else is pretty much unknown in the UK. I bought in a buy one get one free deal with Starsky & Hutch. This was by far the better of the two. The actors all pull off great performances. The teenage boys are much more real then in Movies of a similar genre. The comedy is slightly more subtle then the likes of American Pie and Road Trip and are no were near as obvious. The plot is moved along by the comedy. The two stars Elisha Cuthbert and Emile Hirsch are convincing. But Chris Marquette, Paul Dano and Timothy Olyphant steal every scene they appear in. Obviously in a teen, sex, coming of age comedy there's nudity but its all for comedy not for the sake of pleasing 13 year old boys. If you see a cheap copy of this film you should buy it.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
How do you want Me?,"This movie revolves around a young man named Matthew Kidman(Emilie Hirsch) who is about to graduate but has absolutely nothing to write in his yearbook and nothing interesting to remember his school year by. Until, Danielle(Elisha Cuthbert), moves in next door and in Matthew's eyes and I'm sure to most of us in the audience, she is an angel sent from above. Danielle and Matthew become friends and start to develop into something more until Matthew finds out that Danielle is actually a porn star and that's when trouble starts brewing, misleading Matthew and his friends into many dangerous adventures.I enjoyed half of this movie and for the other half, I couldn't wait for it to finally finish. It's a nice little, interesting and sexy story but there are just too many messy and useless moments that at the end, you forget what the movie was really all about and wonder what was ever really the point, since the movie seems to drag on forever with no real meaning. The cast tries hard to make it work but the dialogue doesn't seem to agree with them. It's a very forgettable movie but still entertaining overall with some funny situations and a great soundtrack.

"Weak, soft attempt at a teen comedy","While kind-hearted and absent of any major flaws, 'The Girl Next Door' doesn't take any chances or break any significant new ground.  It's content has been covered ad nauseum in countless other teen comedies.  So what it becomes is a vehicle for a rising star (Elisha Cuthbert) and for a few wannabees (the boys - one looks, acts, and sounds like a young John Cusack), and for a few has-beens (Timothy Bottoms and Timothy Olyphant).  So it's pretty much a gawk-and-drool fest for the ""it girl"".  The plot has a few holes, unlikely twists, and takes one major loop too many on it's way to the movie's end, and it adds minutes to film that should have been cut.  The whole thing feels too long, and could have been edited and ended more gracefully.  The soundtrack is sloppy, intrusive at times, and uses some older music well but also makes strange choices that just aren't cool.

I gave it 9/10, would have given 10/10 as it was the best movie that I have seen so far this year, but there was too much violence to my liking. I found it better than American Pie/Dumb & Dumber. However, that is probably because I am a hopeless romantic (and also still/again single) and when I was a teenager, one of my favorite films was Can't buy me love (1987).. ..the kind of romantic girls/women there is on films, I don't think exists at all in real life.

Great Sex Comedy with Heart,"The teen sex drama has been littered with movies that thought they could pull it off and they couldn't. The list of those that do it properly is small, but feel free to add The Girl Next Door to that list.Let's get the easy stuff out of the way. Yes, Elisha Cuthbert is hot as hell. However, way more important than that is that this is a star-making performance. She was outstanding. Emile Hirsh plays Matthew, the uptight kid who gets his life changed by the porn star with a heart of gold and owns his role as well. The entire cast is great.I have a few complaints but they are not enough to stop you from seeing this movie.9/10",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Funny Movie,"Matthew Kidman (Emile Hirsch) is a teen over-achiever from a well-to-do community, who falls for the super sexy girl watching the house next door (Elisha Cuthbert). As they get closer, he finds out that she is secretly a porn star, something that he must try to come to terms with as he suddenly finds himself wit a lot of new male friends.The premise sounds pretty good and the film turned out to be pretty funny. The story isn't very original though. It's similar to Risky Business as every film critic has bothered to point out. That didn't bother me though since The Girl Next Door is still an entertaining comedy. Some of the jokes were kind of lame and the movie is a little forgettable. After about a week, only a few scenes really stuck with me. The movie remains consistently entertaining during the running time but it doesn't have a long lasting impression on the viewer nor does it have a good repeat value. It's just a harmless teen comedy and it should be approached as one.The movie works pretty well because of its two appealing leads. Elisha Cuthbert is cool and confident as Danielle. She plays the character pretty well and she's also very pretty. Some people are complaining about Elisha playing the role of a porn star because she is not pretty enough. I strongly disagree, she looks stunning in the movie. Emile Hirsch also gives a good performance as Matthew. His character is likable and somewhat interesting. Tim Olyphant plays Kelly and he gives a pretty funny performance, kind of annoying though. Chris Marquette was just annoying as Eli. His character was supposed to be your stereotypical horny teenager but he just tried too hard to be funny.Director Luke Greenfield is not that reliable as a director. He was behind that horrible movie called ""The Animal"" though he surprisingly does a decent job with this movie. He could have shortened the film a little though. 109 minutes was too long for this type of comedy and especially this story. They ran out of ideas and they seemed to be recycling the old ones. The ending was also kind of weak and not as funny as the beginning or middle. Despite this, I still don't understand why this movie bombed at the box office. It wasn't great but it was a fun way to spend two hours and it the movie does keep the audience entertained. In the end, this is one of 2004's best comedies and it's worth checking out.

"Three guys, a girl and a golden penis","The Girl Next Door arrived in Australia with little fanfare or advertising, largely due to its tepid response in the US. 'Girl' pitched in the trailer as a distant American Pie cousin meets Risky Business ('outrageous' incidents, nudity and 'hot chicks'), actually surpasses those film to deliver what has to be one of more entertaining 'teen' flicks of recent years.This is not to say that this movie is a revelation in film making. The clichéd characters abound (uncool yet not gremlin-esquire lead, geeky friends, oblivious parents, the cool crowd) and the film follows a not entirely road to a happy ending, yet the journey is made satisfying by Emile Hirsch and Cuthbert's likable leads. Cuthbert in particular lends an interesting touch to her lead, she admirably conveys a young woman trapped between two worlds struggling to find her identity without being known as 'the chick from that porno'. Her early scenes with Hirsch set up a great coming of age storyline without resorting to some far fetched hi-jinx to impress.During the middle third of this film (the introduction of Olyphant's porn producer character) the dynamic shifts from romantic comedy to comedy/drama, throwing you into some (albeit glossed over) realities of the porn industry. Hirsch becomes a more admirable lead during the later parts of the film as he comes to terms with his 'moral fiber'.For a sex comedy closing in on two hours this film should drag in its last hurdles, and its 'climax' does feel to be pushing the boundaries of reality, but with competent leads and one of the best soundtrack's from a genre film of this type in years (Filter, David Gray, David Bowie, Echo & The Bunnymen) makes this Girl worth sticking around for.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

Just a new plot-twist is added to stir things around.Also, this thing tries to be a sexy teenage serious drama.

But more surprising was Emile Hirsch, who I genuinely enjoyed seeing as the main character.

Not good but not bad,"The Girl Next Door is more than what it had been advertised. Fox chose to market it as a sex comedy, but indeed this film is way more than that. It follows in the footsteps of Risky Business and American Pie and does something that few sex comedies do anymore; give depth to the story. But that doesn't mean that the story is any good. In fact, it is so unrealistic and so overwritten that the film itself starts to get boring. The first half-hour is the most interesting because you care about the characters. However, when they drag in scenes like the one in Las Vegas or the robbery scene, then the story just dwindles so far down into a bottomless pit of nothingness. The screenplay does have some clever nuances like the creation of a new and totally original sex-ed video which would send shockwaves around the country if such a tape were ever released. But at the heart of the story is the relationship between Matthew and Danielle (played well by Emile Hirsch and Elisha Cuthbert) which is the most thoughtful thing about this film. But the story drags away from that and slips away from being more decent than it could have been. However, the film is better already in the fact that it is not just a flat sex comedy because then the film would not have any depth whatsoever. So I give credit to the writer and the director for making that happen. However, I guess I have to say that such depth is not enough to make this film good.Lenny's Grade: C+",5.0,Anonymous,Romance
A Tastefully Vulgar Movie,"Pros: Elisha Cuthbert, great actors, and good soundtrack Cons: Some dirty scenes took away the meaning of the story,This is without a doubt an excellent movie and deserves the title of being known as a ""cult classic"". The storyline is intriguing and the actors compliment every line in this script. Elisha Cuthbert is perfect for this character and her true abilities are revealed through her difficult role. This is not a smutty teen movie, and can be enjoyed by all mature ages. The dirty scenes are brief and are there to simply enhance the reality portion of story. At no point in this film will you be bored; every second is entertaining. It is much more a love drama than sex comedy.

cinematic masterpiece. no doubts.,"This movie is by far one of the most interesting films I've ever seen. I own the DVD and have watched it more than 10 times, at the very least. What I like about this movie is the fact that most of the plots we take for granted are taken to new heights here. ""Boo!"" to all of you folks who hated it, but I only assume you were expecting to see a PREDICTABLE movie. It steps out-of-the-box with the intricate design of each of the characters, with their inclusion only deepening the plot. The normal twists you find in a regular teen romance movie are finally SECONDARY to the main character's life! He falls and GETS the girl after the first 20 minutes of the movie... and THANK GOD for that. It tweaked my interests from the very start, because you see GETTING the girl isn't as easy as KEEPING her!! Notice at the end of the film, the way he ""accidentally"" introduces each of the characters to be who they really turn out to be (for HIM) in the end... i.e. Kelly as the Student Adviser.

Rotten to its core,"Let me start by saying that I've never seen a movie so shameful and morally compromised as ""The Girl Next Door"" in my life.To make a good teen-comedy about a sensible subject - such as the wild hormones of American teens - , you must detach yourself from everything that might be perceived as vulgar or rude or nasty and come up with some ""sweetnes"" to make the movie more innocent and honest in they eyes of the public. That's one thing this rookie, Luke Greenfield (who had previously directed the dumb feature called ""The Animal"", with Rob Scheider as lead actor), did not understand.Even a teen-comedy has to be more than just girls, tits, sex and porn-stars. I'd like to think that there is a deeper meaning hidden somewhere between those f-words. But, never mind that! I can live with the fact that this movie simply doesn't care to educate people. However, I can't and won't tolerate it's limited moral horizons. Because this so-called ""mild & sweet teen comedy"" deliberately delivers potentially harmful messages to its audience. And does that time and time again.Imagine that a cute teenager with porn-star backgrounds is portrayed in this movie like a dream-girl (true, there is nothing cooler than having a girlfriend who f...s other guys for a living). An Asian student (or geek) from Cambodgia is presented as a sex object (lots and lots of references to sodomy). And there is more. We are made to believe that the adult films industry is not that bad as you'd might think (strangely, the parents even applaud their son, Matthew, for making a porn film, because ""this could really sell""). And let's not forget the biggest boss in the porn world, a guy named Hugo Posh (James Remar), who's actually a good person once you get to know him. Is it just me, or there is something missing here? Since when do we promote porn in teen-comedies?All in all, if you want some nasty jokes, some tits and some crude remarks, then you'll get your share with this movie. But if you want wit and style, avoid it. Because, even with pretty decent acting from Emille Hirsch, Elisha Cuthbert (this girl has sex appeal all right!) and the talented Timothy Olyphant (you may know him from HBO's TV Series Deadwood), The Girl Next Door is one big fat lie.",3.0,Anonymous,Romance
Finally an original teen movie!,"There is nothing more boring than a predictable movie, when you find yourself thinking three or four plot twists ahead of the action on the scene, and still need to concentrate on remaining focused on the film, rather than random thoughts filling the void. This, is definitely not a predictable movie.Sure, its packed with recurring themes and stereotypes from almost every teen comedy being churned out these days, but the writer doesn't use these as crutches for his characters, but just as filler for their personalities, while he concentrates on the twists and turns his main character is being pushed through.All in all, sure it borrows substantially from Risky Business, updated for a new generation, but that isn't necessarily a bad thing. This movie is funny and quirky, and most importantly, interesting. Oh, and Elisha Cuthbert doesn't take any of that away one bit!",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Elisha Cuthbert, oh, that sexy lady","I was just as surprised as anyone when something as seemingly low-brow as this was getting positive reviews over at Rotten Tomatoes. Then I was even more surprised after having watched it, and realizing how amazing terrible the film was.There were jokes, here and there, that were hilarious. I don't 'remember' any of them, but I'm pretty sure there were. Other than those few jokes, everything else was just braindead.For a subject that's largely portioned much more gloomy and dark, I at least give this film credit for making a semi-serious comedy out of it. It's unfortunate that they 'tried' to maintain a level of gloominess and darkness, because that was probably the worst part about this film. Had they simply made a straight-forward comedy, I might've enjoyed more (more Elisha Cuthbert would've also worked).The 'evil guy', whose name I don't remember but could easily check using this website I'm on though I'm too lazy to, was a great character nonetheless. Along with the 'friends', they were great as well. The lead actor though... that guy... annoyed the flipping balony out of me. He can not act, at least he did a hilariously bad job at it in this film.The directing was generic. The montage during he beginning was stupid. The everything else was pretty meh also.Overall, overrated.",4.0,Anonymous,Romance

A Girl Next Door? Umm... lemme see...,This love story is a typical one but with a different perspective from the director and the story teller. There are so many stories with a man falling in love with a hooker done but this one with a porn star is the kindest of them all. Something that makes us understand a relation between two humans much better than just a commercial venture. Something sweet. After all it shows that we humans are not what we are made out to be but just kind at heart like everyone. Its the circumstances that make us what we are.

Barely watchable,"Perhaps I expected too much out of this, since this is a teenage comedy after all, but after watching it last night I'm a bit disappointed. The plot is interesting to begin with but as it goes on it becomes a bit far-fetched. Just when you think the film is over there will be another crazy, unbelievable twist to the story. Also, the main characters are not developed enough, especially the girl herself, who becomes a comedy sidekick as the film goes on.But on the upside the thing that makes this film worth watching is miss Cuthbert looking beautiful as always.

"""Not what you'd expect"" but in a Good Way","The intersection between love and sex, exploring and experience, and a lot of life at every turn.

Afterwards, it just feels very -- real. It draws me in. And it is a good reminder that teenagers are teens but they are growing into adulthood and just by imposing morality, things won't magically change. It's a good movie. It's a very good movie.

disappointing,"boy,what a let down this movie was.i viewed the unrated version,which promised more sex,more skin,more laughs.from what i saw,there was very little skin here,not much sex,either,and zero laughs.Elisha Cuthbert is nice,but she can't make up for how disappointing this movie was.you can tell the movie had some intelligent thought behind it,and wasn't just going for bottom of the barrel comedy.unfortunately,something got lost in the translation for me,as the jokes weren't funny.in fact,i found the movie bland.though this version was unrated,the original version was rated R by the MPAA.in Canada,it was 18A,except for Ontario,which was 14A.i happen to agree withe 14A rating.for me,that's what it should have been rated,including the unrated version.my best advice,if you're a parent,is to pre screen the movie,and decide if you children are mature enough for it.for me,The Girl Next Door is a 5/10",5.0,Anonymous,Romance
Top of the line for the genre.,I first came across this movie when I was in middle school while channel surfing with my brother in my grandma's basement on her TV. We saw the name on the channel guide and thought of the Drake and Josh episode so we turned it on and it was at the beginning. I didn't think too much of it at the time when we watched it and thought it was alright. It was not until years later when I was 19 one night I came home at like midnight with a domino's pizza and thought of this movie out of the blue and decided to give a re-watch.It was here where I fell in love with the style and utmost cheesy 2000s teen/sex/coming of age/romcom genre. Despite its obvious shortcomings I look passed most of it and enjoyed the plot and adventure. Maybe it's just me trying to live vicariously through these characters and their exploits. But I will never not enjoy this movie and for that reason alone I give it a 9/10.,9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Completely unexpected good hearted rom-com,"I was kind of fooled by the marketing of this but it sounded intriguing anyway and I'd learned the lesson that seemingly gross out comedies like American Pie, Old School and The 40 Year Old Virgin can actually be good fun and have a lot more going for them.Do NOT think this is some kind of gross out or tasteless low brow comedy, despite the unfortunate marketing and apparent subject matter. In fact if anything it struck me as a very well crafted old fashioned romantic film at heart (in a good way). This is really probably not the film you think it is.High points. The cast is excellent, absolutely all on top form for every character. The direction, photography and use of music are top notch - everything seems to hit the right note perfectly. You start out thinking you'll see a crass comedy and end up seeing a very skillfully made film, with likable characters and a really good heart at the core of it. It's also extremely funny! Low points. It's very much a fantasy film and very romantic. In this sense it really doesn't touch on it's supposed core theme 'the porn industry' in any realistic way. Porn producers are lovable rogues. AIDS is never mentioned. The whole thing is so wholesome! I don't really think this is a low point as the film is essentialy a romantic fantasy and the portrayal of the porn characters is very funny and in no way meant to be realistic.I really enjoyed it.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

Risky Business can rest easy.,"Though not a complete disaster, The Girl Next Door doesn't come close to reaching the status of that 1983 classic it so often tries to imitate. With this film, we have a lot of ideas and an uneven tone that just cannot be formed into a truly worthwhile experience. Some scenes are clearly inspired by the Tom Cruise vehicle of yesteryear, and other ideas seem to have wandered in from such films as Weird Science, or even Something Wild. Though filled with sleazy situations and characters, in the end the film seems to fancy itself as some kind of nostalgic feel-good movie about the most memorable thing about high school for the lead character.Emile Hirsch, a likable kid, stars as Matthew Kidmann. He's an intelligent kid just about to wrap up a successful senior year of high school. All he is focused on is winning a scholarship to pay for his education at a prestigious university. (Harvard? I forget where) Of course his world is turned on its head when a beautiful young woman moves in next door and causes him to make some very bad decisions. Sound like a familiar plot? Making matters worse is the fact that the girl is a porn star, which is a fact his friends soon point out. And her smarmy producer/boyfriend doesn't like this high school kid trying to get his woman out of such a lucrative business. Still sound familiar? It should. Lots of plot complications ensue and the kid is forced to make what we are led to believe is a porno film to raise a bunch of money he lost that would have allowed an exchange student to come to America from Asia.The film probably fails more than anything due to the fact it isn't that funny. There are some laughs here and there, but it doesn't measure up to more raunchy teen films of the day. Lots of stereotypical characters in most scenes. Is it just California high schools where the popular kids pile into convertibles and ride around acting like their lives are the greatest as the less-popular kids sigh when they drive past? Never seen that around my neck of the woods. Here they use pick up trucks. Another big problem is this film's lack of conviction regarding the world of pornography. Lots of talk about sex, but very little nudity. Even in the unrated version. No compelling love scenes here like there were in Risky Business. And the twist ending regarding the film these people make during their prom is more of a cop-out than anything. The film does have a good soundtrack, and Elisha Cuthbert is a welcome sight in every scene. Nice try, but watch Risky Business instead. 5 of 10 stars.The Hound.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance

Pop Culture Junk,"This movie is a typical ""boy meets girl"" story. Without getting into the whole ""porn"" issue, the story is about a group of kids living their teenage lives in ""La La land"" California. What I had trouble with is the way they marketed the movie being a movie ""for the next generation."" What? How does this stupid movie define a generation let alone be for a new generation? Since the film only showcases the high 1% of teenagers living in LA county, how can the rest off the 99% of the youth in America relate with this flick? It is unrealistic and crude to be anywhere close to being reality, let alone defining a generation. Besides that, The Girl Next Door is your typical story about ""the girl next door"" that every guy wants. This storyline has been reproduced many times. This movie stands on its own by teasing its audience every ten seconds with sex, sex, and more sex. Far from an excellent movie.

An obscene and indecent movie. Really??,"After watching this amazing movie with Elisha Cuthbert and Emile Hirsch probably 5 or 6 times, I decided to do some research about its beginnings.I found comments ranging from disgusting and unappealing to charming and sexy. But, what is the truth behind one of the most controversial teen movies of all time?? Here it goes: First, my point of view of this movie(as you can see in my vote) is that it is a success. 4 nominations? Not a lot of movies get that many. But what I really want to discuss in this movie is the subjective and most symbolic aspects. This kind of movies may be found obscene and unpleasant, but once you watch this one, your opinion about teen movies with sexual themes is going to change.Lets look at the life of Danielle. Ex-porn star at just the age of 19, and now she wants to change her life. But, of course, most juveniles her age have seen or heard about a movie she has been part of. I can only imagine how difficult it is for somebody like her to get someone in her life, moreover for love life. So, let's look at it this way, she is looking for a second chance, nobody would give a single try, but there is always someone, that special person that in the end, appears in your life. And that is when Matthew Kidman comes in. This high school senior geek lives a boring life in school, never getting the chance to live the fullest. He finds her, and both receive a 180 degree turn to their lives. This girl is just beautiful, charismatic and loving. She finds herself getting the chance she wanted and enjoying being a new person, all because of the help of Matthew. Great love story.Now, lets go for Matthew. Shy, geeky, but also smart, charismatic and devoted to his cause, this high school senior with aspirations to a scholarship to Georgetown University gets a whole twist in his life when Danielle comes in. Now, he finds himself struggling with his emotions and feelings. But in the end, he knows what is best to do, and that is to give it all for the girl that changed his life and made him a happier and most sociable person. He loves her from the first time, and the way he fights for the love of Danielle is just unbelievable, even risking his chances to go to college. That is what if call moral fiber.Forgiveness, I believe, is what would describe what is happening in this film, and a second chance to the lives of two completely different youths who needed each other to find their inner selves. Love, true friendship, and lots of devotion are also the greatest aspects of this movie. Sacrificing what you think is right, to do the RIGHT thing for that special person.So really, why do we settle for less, why try something new for one time. The experience will change our point of view. The Girl Next Door is one of the GREATEST titles about love, friendship and devotion(once again this three) of all time.And of course, in the end, when you watch it, enjoy it, and see the most inner and philosophical point of view, you know the juice was worth the squeeze",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
better than I expected,"Elisha Cuthbert's portrayal of the character Danielle was much more sensitive and realistic than I had expected. The entire movie, while having its necessary idiotic moments and ridiculous plot, was filled with more nuance and tenderness than I had thought possible from this plot and genre. Most romantic comedies, and certainly most movies about the adult film industry, are hesitant to deal with the shattered and abused souls, manipulation, coercion, and youth of the female adult film stars. Elisha and the director of the film, Luke Greenfield, manage to make a sexy, funny, wholly enjoyable film while not shying away from the tragedies of Danielle's personal history. Kudos to the cast and directors for pulling this off.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Don't Lie.,"You watched this because Elisha Cuthbert was FIRE (as the kids say) at the time this came out, and the idea of her playing a porn star in what the trailers suggested was going to be the steamiest, sexiest film of the decade was enough to bring you in. And yeah, she looked great in it, and it was pretty suggestive. And no, you didn't see nearly as much of her as was suggested, and it wasn't nearly as steamy and sexy as it had been billed.The film itself? It's not terrible, but it's definitely not good either. The best part is Timothy Olyphant chewing up the scenery in every one of his scenes as the a-hole porn producer.

One of the many gems of 2004,"This movie was advertised as a frat boy comedy, primarily highlighting the sexual parts of it. But it turns out to be a genuine movie with an interesting premise for a rom-com.Plot- I'll start of by saying that this isn't some sort of American Pie rip off. The movie explores the struggle of choosing success over making memories with friends, misconceptions about sexual behavior, and growing up. The ups and downs hit you in the chest, the awkward moments make you feel for the characters, and the things they get into are wild and hilarious. Alot happens in the short run time.Characters/Acting- Loved every character. All very well played without overdoing it for the sake of laughter. The villain played by Timothy Olyphant is one of my favorite characters ever. The romance is believable and adorable. Really couldn't find a moment of acting that felt out of touch.Writing- I think that it has very memorable lines, all hilarious and/or touching, with the exception of a few moments. Maybe a few lines in the film feel off kilter and that's the only reason I rated it 9 instead of 10.Production- This movie is jam packed with great music, and not in an annoying way either. I shazam'd like every 2 minutes. The direction is focused and sharp. Felt like the vibes of American Beauty mixed with American Pie (minus the dark themes of the former.)All in all it's not a flawless film but it brings such to the table that it's hard not to fall in love with it. Probably one of the only frat boy-esque romcoms that you could actually watch with a girlfriend (although there's quite a bit of nudity in it.)",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
"True, Natural, little awkward but very enjoyable.","This movie isn't very real but emotions portrayed are. Film is about a teenager (Emile) who will be soon high school graduated and looking for scholarship for which he is preparing from long.

Consequences lead him to her and then story moved fwd showcasing today's high school life, beginning and breaking of emotions, teen friendship and how easily teen can be influenced. I am not going to tell you the story or plot as I just loved the naturalness in it and though it definitely not the unique one, it certainly more thrilling to get to see it without any expectation or information.Director Luke Greenfield has done good job and developed characters effectively. Especially Emile and Elisha. Both have good talent and will heading for good future. Elisha has some resemblance with Natalie Portman especially the way she smiles but will sure make niche for herself soon. All support cast has done some good job as well especially Timothy Olyphant who played porn movie producer.I definitely recommend the movie as must watch especially for people who love simple movies with real emotions though sometimes become awkward to watch but you enjoy them for their true portrayal.

Are we back in the '80s?,"""The Girl Next Door"" is one of 2004's most entertaining movies -- sweet, crude; funny, sad; moralistic, filthy. Uneven mixtures of opposites attract, much like the leading stars of the film, for a movie that delights the audience at every turn. It manages to satirize the teen comedy genre whilst exploiting it. This is raunchier than ""American Pie"" and yet also far more sophisticated.Emile Hirsche plays Matthew Kidman, a 19-year-old high school senior who hasn't lived life to the fullest during his pre-graduation phase. While fellow schoolmates skip school to go party at the beach, Matthew sits in class, gazing outside at the partying teens, wishing he could be like them.Then the girl next door moves in: Danielle (Elisha Cuthbert), a drop-dead-gorgeous blonde beauty who undresses across the street from Matthew as he watches in his bedroom. She spots him peeking at her, then plays cruel revenge tricks on him, and then eventually falls in love with him because ""of the way he looked at her.""She is touched by Matthew's honesty because she is a former porn star (at the age of 19) and is not used to receiving true affection. When Matthew finds out about her background he is mad, then happy, jumping at the opportunity to sleep with Danielle. Danielle feels betrayed and rushes off to Las Vegas for an adult film star convention. Matthew follows her and tries to ""get her back"" as so many heroes always do, but falls out with Danielle's producer, Kelly (played perfectly by Timothy Olyphant).The movie eventually tackles a number of subplots -- Matthew learning to ""go with it"" and loosen up; Danielle abandoning her past and looking forward to the future; a Cambodian genius being transferred to Matthew's school; Kelly and Matthew's falling out; Matthew's college scholarship, etc. The film juggles all these different ideas, managing to maintain the audience's interest.Yes, it is a bit raunchy at times and the subject matter is probably inappropriately handled in some scenes. However, the core message of the film is beautiful. It's hidden underneath an unfortunate layer of smut that nevertheless fails to harm the film in any way.Obviously inspired by the teen films of the 1980s, such as ""Risky Business"" and the plethora of John Hughes-produced/directed flicks, ""The Girl Next Door"" even boasts a great soundtrack that complements the nature of the film.The acting is one of the movie's most surprising elements -- Hirsche and Cuthbert share chemistry, despite the fact that their two-year age different in real life is quite obvious (Cuthbert looks much older). That's sorta the point, though. Cuthbert is absolutely beautiful, but people wandering into the theater hoping to see her nude should look elsewhere. ""The Girl Next Door"" is better than that -- an honest and touching teen comedy that cares for its characters and studies them carefully. When Matthew and Danielle finally share a love scene it is handled with tenderness, something rare in movies like this.""The Girl Next Door"" is a teen comedy for adults.4/5.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Good.. for the first 25 minutes,"""Girl next door"" comes off as a good movie, when watching the first 25 minutes. Editing, soundtrack and camera work makes it stand out from other teenybopper flicks, by looking somewhat more professional.The acting is OK and the storyline is passable and somewhat captivating. It seems as if the story is about the guy and this girl falling in love and having to overcome some problems, including the usual comic relief, which could actually have become quite a good movie. Then, for some odd reason about 25 minutes into this abomination, the whole storyline spirals into a farce with a plot that's been used so many times before, it hurts.All of a sudden, the girl almost disappears from the script leaving the the main male character behind with (ofcourse) his two nerdy friends, who's never gotten laid, and then... well, and then it seems the director tries to kill off this movie in the best way possible, 'cus he knows he messed up. This results in a long and booooooring movie that should've never left the paper it was written on. For the last 30 minutes of this flick, you keep thinking ""ok, it HAS to end now"", but noooo, somehow it keeps going on and on and on...Bad plot, bad acting, bad writing, bad directing, bad editing, in fact it all sucks.. except for the soundtrack which was very well compiled, but not really suited for a silly movie like this.",4.0,Anonymous,Romance

One of the best Coming of Age movies!,"I remember watching this one when it first came out in 2004. The later on buying the VHS of it, or maybe the DVD if they were out by then. I wanted it for the collection because it was such a great movie.You had three middle of the road kids. They weren't geeks. But they weren't in the popular crowd either. And then a porn actress moves in next door to one of them and they start dating.Hijinks ensue when one of the friends recognizes who she is and shows her boyfriend who then takes their advice and treats her poorly because of her porn past. But he realized his mistake nearly as soon as he made it and he won her back and they end up doing something incredible.Those three became who every high school seniors at the time wanted to be. They became legends. The kids who incoming classes remember and talk about for ages.It was truly a great movie and I still get it out every year or two to watch! {I upgraded to the Bluray a few years back}",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Is one of the best...,"The Girl Next door is the dream of every teenager and at the same time is the nightmare of every one that has a future plan.

Sex Education at its finest,"The great thing about this movie is that it does not really fortifies itself with the SEX but rather it gives us a sense of what high school is like and the challenges we face during, and that moment where our parents pressure us to tell them what course and which school we want to take our college degree in. And most of all, thinking of ways to make that awesome SENIOR YEAR last. TGND highlights all these concepts in this amazing hour and a half movie. Ms.Cuthbert is mesmerizing as the famous porn star Danielle aka Athena. The lead guy also gives an amazing performance along with his two friends. All in all, I would definitely recommend this film although this film would not be in the ranks of a family film but if you want a feel good film then this is the one for you.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Risky Business 2004....actually,"I saw Risky Business when it was first released. Tom Cruise was my hero! For a long time I was mesmerized by that movie, like most young men at the time.2004 I saw The Girl Next Door when it was released, and I had no idea what it was about...at all! About half way through, however, I started to think and compare this movie to Risky Business.The music....the attitude (fuck it) I mean....this was just an updated version. Well when the porn stars came on board to shoot the video and everything was spinning out of control...I knew this movie was either a hack...or a tribute.The movie was not quite as fun as Risky Business....the characters were not built up as strong, especially the lead. But I really liked this movie! It still makes you feel good, and wish that you were the young man in question. After all...I think most young men, and older, have fantasized about having a porn star fall in love with them.Good movie!!!",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Overly contrived, unfocused teen comedy which has its moments, but doesn't work","What sounded like a fun, sexy inventive comedy just stands to prove, that like people or anything else in the world, looks can be deceiving.The Girl Next Door is not entirely dead in the water, but it's disappointing. Comedies can get away with being impossible for sure, but this film starts out rather strait forward, and then progressively defies common sense without adding any real humour or wit to justify it. Everynow and then, I did find myself laughing, (out loud even) but these moments are too few and far between in a rather lame screenplay, which doesn't amount to much.Another problem is the lack of character. I wanted to care for the two love birds that the movie is supposed to be about, but their romance is highly unbelievable and turns out to be the last of the film's interests. We spend more time with characters that really don't have any major importance, and the film's attempts to make them important don't work.So much happens in the film, that about one hour in, you'd think it's about to collapse. Actually The climax is the best part. It is here where the humour is at its best (although that still doesn't say enough) and then in the last five minutes, things get sour again, in the form of a piece of s**t ending which is arguably the most idiotic part, and is totally unsatisfactory.Director Luke Greenfield is so desperate to shock and surprise his audience over the course of ninety plus minutes, that he seems to have forgotten the most important ingredients of the film. The Girl Next Door is bone dry of charm and intelligence, and it's sense of humour is inconsistent and also insufficent. I'll have to say skip this film.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance
"A seriously funny, sexy, exciting and different high-school comedy","I've always hated stupid comedy's, and loathed teenage comedy's in general. This film is however extremely well done in all ways. Normally I wouldn't watch something marketed like this, but I found it interesting due to the talents of Emilie Hirsch and Paul Dano.It's extremely well played by all in cast. Timothy Olyphant, Emile Hirsch, Elisha Cuthbert, yeah all are instructed to use their eyes in their acting. Showing off their acting skills.It's sexy, daring, it's genuinely funny, romantic, charming and as the film rolls on it's unexpected, smart and very professionally made.Technically it's beautifully filmed and cut, the music score is perfect and well put together, and it's a very pleasant watch in any way.I would recommend this over any other comedy in this genre. I would say this is. Great way of showing that a high-school comedy, or a sex comedy doesn't have to be lame.Be on the watch for the next Luke Greenfield comedy! It might even deserve more than 8/10 due to the talent put into it. But it's still a high school comedy! It's also now on my top comedy list.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
so-so remake of Risky Business,"The similarities in the story with Risky Business are so strong as to be unmistakable.  There are some differences, mainly in the sweetness of the relationship between the main characters Matthew and Danielle.  This made the movie somewhat enjoyable, but all in all, the story was simply lacking in original elements.  I like Elisha Cuthbert, but I think that in this case the casting of her in this role was based on her present appeal and not because she was the best actor for this particular role.  She does a very good job, but it is still just too hard to believe her as a porn star. Maybe it would have been more believable if she hadn't been so sweet (if it is possible for Elisha to not be sweet) but then if she hadn't been sweet, it would have been hard to believe that Matthew would have fallen for her. This suggests a fundamental problem with the concept, which is no surprise, but it still would probably have come off better if the Danielle character had been cast with someone a little more believable as a porn star.  Then again, what is going to sell this movie is not its believability, but the appeal of the two main characters for the teenage dating couples that will be the main audience for this movie.  I like Elisha (did I already say that?) but I don't think that this sort of light-heated comedy suits her, and I would much rather see her in a major role in a serious action-drama of some sort.  This sort of fluff is not going to do her any good, and she is far more talented, so she should try to skip past these sorts of roles and go straight for the first serious role that comes her way.All in all, this is decent date movie for a older teens and younger twenty-somethings who don't object to the R-rated theme and the small dose of nudity.  You won't see Elisha nude, by the way, and I admire her determination to not cede to what surely must have been some very heavy pressure for her to appear partially nude.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance

Marginal thumbs down...lots of potential...not enough to recommend,"There were times throughout this movie that I really wanted to slit my wrists. The story is choppy and inconsistent which is only noticed b/c of its lack of humor. The storyline had potential and I really wanted to like it, but in the end (which is long and drawn out btw), I just couldn't appreciate. It definitely had some good moments and Cutberth is extremely beautiful and gives a great performance throughout but that's not enough to recommend a movie. Olyphant's character was too inconsistent and wasted on his talents but he does steal just about every scene he's in. The ending is long, drawn out and really stupid and I believe every scene has some kind of song for the situation. Without giving anything away, I believe this movie could've ended 30mins. earlier at the prom without all the other stuff to worry about. It just simply became too much of a comedy of errors (in both the story and the writing) and just when you thought (or hoped in my case) that it was over...here we go again with another annoying problem. They could have done so much with this (like focused more on Cutberth's character) but focused too much on being a teen flick instead of a good movie. Cutberth's and Olyphant's talents are wasted and I can't even recommend this to teens. There were several opportunities to turn this into a movie with heart and sweetness but instead tries to be funny and fails. A true disappointment. THUMBS DOWN!!!! 5/10",5.0,Anonymous,Romance

"From the Writers of ""Van Wilder"" & the Director of ""the Animal"" comes a movie that surprisingly didn't suck TOTAL ass","Matthew (Emile Hirsch) is a nerdy nobody who can't think of anything he'll fondly remember from high school after he graduates. That is until former porn star, Danielle (""24""'s Elisha Cuthbert) shows up as the new girl next door.Things get complicated (as these films are prone to do) when her former porn manager comes calling to get her back. This adolescent male fantasy suffers from way too much music on the soundtrack (nearly every scene of the film is scored with a late '80's or early '90's tune with the purpose to substitute for any true emotional feeling), a insincere undeserved sentimentality that permeates through the film, and a surprising lack of laughs. While the acting is fair enough and the film is watchable, it still lacks any memorability and will be forgotten after a while. Still, it remains a step up for the Director and writers, if a step down for much of the cast.My Grade: C-",5.0,Anonymous,Romance

not even a little bit funny,"In one of the scenes that pretends to be funny in this film the main male character is punished to run naked after the car drove by the main female character. 'It's not funny' he complains. 'It's a little bit funny' she answers. Talking about the film, he is the one to be right!'The Girl Next Door' is an unpleasant mix of teenage comedy, moralizing story and social comment about the porn industry. It takes a good director to mix these themes in a good film, and this movie did not get one. The script bares much guilt as it is never comic enough, sharp enough, crazy enough or credible enough to have the viewer path the threshold of 'so what'?'. Acting does not help either. We never get to care about the characters, they do not succeed to make us love or hate them. I liked Elisha Cuthberg in '24' - one of the best series of the latest years in American TV - but she does not hold the capabilities or she did not enjoy the hand of a good director to turn the role into something to remember. All male teen actors are directed in a way that makes them look unfit for life and screen. The better acted parts are the two supporting roles of the porn moguls, but this is not enough.'Euro-Trip' proved this year that there is a chance for the teenage comedy genre. With 'Girl Next Door' we are back to the moralistic view of the world. Trying to sell the 'human side' of the pornography world in a teenage comedy with 'moral fiber' (another quote from the film) takes much more talent. This film lacks it. 4 out of 10 on my personal scale.",4.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Completely out of touch with reality, mediocre predictable.","I watched this film because I thought it would be fun, and because of Elisha Cuthbert. In the end I found myself rather disappointed. To begin with the plot isn't that fun, nor funny, except for a very few jokes, it is all very stupid. The acting has nothing special at all, it could be all right, but the story is just too brainless, it's almost frustrating to watch. I really thought I would enjoy this film, and even thou I like Cuthbert a lot, I don't think she's worth it, this film doesn't give any positive emotions, it's pretty mediocre and leaves no feeling, nothing at all, except of course a feeling that one has badly invested his time.Next to this film, American Pies and other teen movies look fairly good.My advise is to watch this film only if you are bored to death, or if you really like Elisha Cuthbert.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance
I feel nostalgic every time I see this film,"I am an honest guy and I got to admit that when I originally watched this film back on the 4th of April 2011, I was expecting a graphic sexual comedy with the unique goal of displaying nudity and gratuitous sex to a teenage masculine audience... was I so ever wrong. Unfortunately, that is the way it was marketed back in 2003-4 (I remember seeing this movie being advertised on television when I was ten years old and all I could retain from the commercials was the possible high amount of sexual content in it!).This is my first review. I was always tempted to do one, but I never found a film that sufficiently inspired me to do so... until now. I have never been so attached to a character before. The script is surprisingly deep (compared to what I really expected) and the comedic sequences are well inserted in the film without making them appear unnecessary or awkward. The best part about this movie is that everything ends on a optimistic mood. No bad feelings of revenge or of any other sort. There are no losers: it's a real feel good movie.Among the reviews that I have seen, a lot of people gave the film a 10/10. I usually reserve those for serious and thought provoking movies such as American History X, Fight Club, Dark Night, just to name a few; however, it definitely does not deserve a 6.8/10 either. I give it a 7.5-7.7/10, especially after watching it a second time (The first time I watched this I couldn't fall asleep after because I couldn't believe how flipping good it was).This is not an objective sophisticated review like I sometimes see for some movies. But this movie touched my heart so much that I am actually writing this at 2 AM (right before my final exam the same day) so this greatly demonstrates the quality of this true work of art.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

Matthew doesn't know how to take the news or how to treat Danielle, and things go from bad to worse, when Danielle's former producer Kelly appears to take her back.When you first look at the description for this film, you might seem slightly put off about the idea of the lead female character being a porn star, but the story isn't all about that, and does actually have a soul and heart. Of course there is the slight nudity, but then what R-rated comedy film doesn't have nudity? The script is very cleverly written, with smart jokes and lovable characters. You can feel just what the characters might feel, and really makes you think what you would do.

Raunchy antics with heart and unusual gravity,"The Girl Next Door dressed itself up in a bubblegum marketing campaign of American Pie- esque ditziness as well as a promise of sleaze, lowbrow humour and good old fashioned brain dead teen sex comedy sluttiness. Couldn't have subverted expectations more than it did. Don't get me wrong, a whole lot of it is exactly what I just said it wasn't in my first sentence above, but alongside that that super crude, millennial carnality is a story with a head and heart in either hand, and it's mind in the right place. A silly, eye rolling sex- scapade no doubt, but one with well drawn characters, a terrific script, and a wonderful sense of bawdy fun that calls to mind the comforting nostalgia of a National Lampoon flick, married with the off colour tinge of a 60's sex comedy. Nnever does it lose sight of the feelings, struggles and desires of its two lead actors. Emilie Hirsch is equally vulnerable and gutsy as Matthew, a high school introvert with no experience in the realm of all things female. He's tantalized by his new neighbour Danielle, an ex porn star played by Elisha Cuthbert. Cuthbert has never been as good as she was here (not even playing Jack Bauer's daughter) or as goddamn sexy. She balances a tricky role that could have easily strayed into easy titillation with laid back reactions and down to earth charm that carries the movie. She's amused by naive Matthew, eventually attracted, and ultimately smitten. Matthew learns that lust is only skin deep and real attraction comes from stuff like eye contact and conversation, and that sex is only something special when one knows who one is with to begin with. Nice little allegory for eager beaver male youth, and a pearl of wisdom I really wish I was privy to at his age. Trouble arrives in the form of Danielle's horrendously captivating ex boyfriend, porn director Kelly, played with slick acid tongued alpha male sleaze by irresistible Timothy Olyphant, looking like Hugh Hefner had a kid with Wolverine, before he took up the mantle of Raylan Givens. You see, Danielle clearly believes she's no better than a career as a porn actress, and it takes the simple devotion of Matthew, a high school nebbish who has learned to see her as more than just an Old Milwaukee pinup girl at the end of the rainbow, but as the genuine object of his affections, to convince her otherwise. The fact that such a touching arc for both of them exists in such a loud and proud gross out sex romp of a comedy is proof of life from both writer, director and cast alike. This is a fun flick too, every character a whip smart, realistic depiction of people we've all met in our post growing up exploits. Matthew's two hapless high school chums are priceless, payed by a hyperactive, horndog Chris Marquette and an awkward Paul Dano. James Remar, that old dog, shows up in a wink and nudge role as Danielle's hilarious ex boss, porn king Hugo Posh. The film's anchored by the unexpected substance hiding just below its apparently superfluous exterior shell. Plus, it's an absolutely hilarious, raunchy flick that will give you a boner, make you sopping wet with all kinds of bodily fluids, and put a big goofy grin on your face and make you let out a nice romantic sigh all at once.

better than you think,"OK, so when i sat down to watch this it was purely because i had nothing else to do. I started the film with absolutely no expectations as most films like this are awful.

The second half of this flick is more than enjoyable and certainly the best in its genre that i have seen. i would recommend this to anyone who's just in the mood for a good laugh. the best thing about this film without a doubt is the originality, you really cant see some of it coming at all.watch this if you want a bit of good fun, and a film that will leave you with a warm feeling :)",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

Come guys it was excellent,"hey guys did you see the director comment on ""Behind The scenes""? He said that if you know Elisha Cuthbert you'd say she is nice, but when you see the movie, you would be enchanted by the character and you'd really get your heart melted, AND THAT IS WHAT SHE DID. I think Elisha was great on this film, and i wasn't even registered in this site but i really wanted to put my comment here, cause many people here say that this movie sucks... YOUR WRONG, if you haven't watched it yet please DO, its worth the ride, the movie has a real interesting scrip and its definitely not a ""Scary movie"" or ""Not another teen movie"" crap. There where some really good actors here and everyone that thinks that good actors only appear on dramas your wrong, everyone dit a great job and i really think this is a great movie, fun, some edgy parts and WATCH IT!!!!!!!!!Although its a reaaaaaaaally good movie i wouldn't see it twice... cause is not that kind of movie, but you'll enjoy it, i gave it a 10 on a teenager comedy scale, many people here don't but a ten to a comedy cause they think they are good critics... well, sometimes you got to reward a good fun movie, that's worth it of your time and it will entertain you for sure....watch it guys, good script, good actors, good story, good movie!",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

Best movie I've seen,"this movies was so good because it come from like my point of view a teenagers view and really showed how tough it is to grow up if u don't take changes. Sometimes you have to risk everything for something or someone you want thats what this movie was all about someone that loved someone and risked his whole future for a great girl. I like how they created the setting of it to. Emile Hirsch was in high school and Elisha Cuthbert had already had been out for a year and they lived right next door to each other. ME personally i think Elisha Cuthbert is the hot girl out there right now. She look so hot in this movie the people that worked with her did a great job. The two most important things that came to me were the way Emile Hirsch and Elisha Cuthbert looked at each other through out the whole movie and the music. Over all i think this movie was the best movie i've seen because it came from a teenagers point of view.

you can't trust trailers anymore.,"being in the business of creating movie trailers is quite large. because usually the advertisers are put to the task of making a bad movie (van helsing) look good. but i rarely see an advertising company make a good movie (girl next door) look bad. i think its because some stupid marketing exec, thought it would sell a lot more as a horny teenage softcore prono flick. but its not. i thought maybe i liked this movie so much because i was so pleasantly surprised, but i've watched it twice since and now own it. now this isn't the best movie ever made, and doesn't deserve an Oscar. but the director (Luke Greenfield) seemed to get the story he wanted to tell out perfectly. it was funny, sexy, and i found this movie even inspirational after viewing it. it pushes the idea of an average shmo finding this perfect girl, the girl he'd do anything for, and with time of fighting for her you see some amazing character development. something teen based movies tend to miss out on. and it was filled with some of the best soundtracks i've heard in a movie like this for a while. i totally recommend this movie. and i'm hoping to see some more work from greenfield soon.i'm giving this one an 8.2/10",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
BEst movie i have seen in a while,"When I saw the commercial for this movie I thought it would be like the American Pies, (Lots of nudity and vulgar moments), But this was a very tastefully done movie with a very good love story to it. At times it could be quite raunchy but that is very small detail to the movie. The tagline misleads you also, (He never saw her coming, but all his friends had). It makes you think it is going to be very risky, but it is not. Elisha Cuthbert and Emile Hirsh are to wonderful actors and between them had great chemistry. After I watched this movie I couldn't take my mind off it for weeks. I have got the unrated on DVD and I made all my friends watch it and they loved it. Very well done, wonderful direction and acting, 10 out of 10. A must see.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Completely Misunderstood,"First of all, I loved this movie. It really irritates me how it was set up by the PR people to be another American Pie or Van Wilder or something of the sort. Those movies are just gross out teen comedies. This movie actually had HEART. The problem is, a movie like this misses 90% of its audience because 80% of the audience is guys (aged 13-75) hoping to see Elisha Cuthbert naked, while the other 10% already writes it off as another teen comedy and doesn't give it a chance. What is the deal?!? If you watched this movie once, watch it again and pay attention to the message and the character development. I believe you will get much more out of it a second time.My rating is a 9 out of 10...it was just incredibly acted, had an amazing screenplay, and, need I say this again, it had HEART.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Better than expected,"This movie is apparently coming out April 9 now; maybe they want to get more press first. I got to see a sneak preview, and this movie actually made me feel for the characters at the end. Strange, but true. It has bits of everything - drama, comedy, etc. Mostly too bizarre to be real but has a strange touch of believability. You'll probably be able to find some character in the story to relate to -- the nerdy kid, the popular guy, etc. I really did not think that this movie would be something I'd watch other than for Elisha Cuthbert (certainly, it doesn't hurt that she's mezmorizing), but I'd say on the whole it was really well done, and something completely different from what movies are like these days. This isn't a rehash of anything, so it's worth a watch.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
An excellent moral play.,"The Girl Next Door: This film is directed by Luke Greenfield (The Animal) and written by David Wagner and Brent Goldberg (Van Wilder). From that information you might assume that this film is a generic mainstream comedy, and in that assumption you would be wrong. The Girl Next Door is an offbeat Romantic Comedy that defies the very genre that it is marketed to. Emile Hirsch (The Emperor's Club) stars as Matthew Kidman, a straight A college bound student whose life is turned upside down when he meets the Girl Next Door in question, Danielle (Elisha Cuthbert). Danielle catches Matthew staring at her changing through a window, and in punishing him they become friends. However, Matthew's pornography obsessed friend Eli (Chris Marquette) informs him that Danielle has a sordid past as a porn star. It becomes Matthew's goal to convince her that she's better than the pornographic industry, much to the chagrin of her producer Kelly (Timothy Olymphant). The Girl Next Door is a delightful comedy with much more than just teen raunch gimmicks. In fact, this film may be more suitable to an adult audience, which will appreciate the film's finer points a great deal more. The movie is a great romantic comedy with its morals in the perfect place, and is highly recommended. I'm debating on either a 7.5 or an 8, but I'll leave it at ****1/2 (A-) (8/10) for now.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Maybe better than American Pie, Definately the next.","The Girl Next Door..Shes a hot one, Eliza Cuthbert plays Emile Herisch's hot next door neighbour whom he falls deeply in love with!.I got to see this film showing as a free preview at a local cinema, well when i say local i mean i had to catach a train a fair long way but risked it because this really looked like it was going to be one hell of a funny movie from what i had seen and it REALLY lived up to my expectations! The movie has everything romance, porn and a whole lot of laughs and when you come out of the cinema you really feel good about yourself, it was a fun movie and i will definately pay to see it many more times, it may not be as crude as american pie but its definately on the same Parr with it.

Can I move in?,"The Girl Next Door is a really funny movie about a guy who for his whole life has played by the rules. Matt Kidman is a straight-laced guy who never does anything wrong until he sees the girl of his dreams. In his final year at high school, he decides to go a little wild. One night while taking out the garbage he sees a beautiful girl walking into the house next door. Danielle is the kind of girl that will and does change Matt's life; she turns his ordinary life into one crazy adventure after another. Soon the two bond and have a strong relationship. After a while he learns that Danielle is not who she says she is. Matt soon finds that his life is spinning out of control and the only one who can fix it is him. Now with the help of his friends he will go the limit and achieve something that no one ever though he was capable of doing. Up and comers Emile Hirsch and Elisha Cuthbert play the two leads in the film, their on screen chemistry is extremely well-matched. They are two great young actors who are perfect for their roles.  The film is very funny, a little predictable, but a good film in all. I give The Girl next Door a C + and 2.9 out of 4.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

Especially the final part when the whole family and the guy from the university saw the video, I did hold my breath about the bad thing ahead. Fortunately, what happened was quite amazing. The ending was nice and satisfactory for me. The three buddies got their own love, their masterpiece got good sale records and they realized their dreams. Thanks.

Cameron Crowe Meets Risky Business,"Saw a sneak of this film in Burbank.  Really enjoyed it.  It could be a huge hit if the marketing was tinkered with a bit.  Very similar to Cameron Crowe films, especially in shot compositions and the way music is incorporated. Elliott Smith's Angeles is used in a Graduate way.  All the music choices are perfect.  This flick has got a lot of heart and solid acting.  It's also very funny.  I dug it.  Cuthbert's character could have been fleshed out a bit more.  You really only see her through the protagonist's eyes and maybe that's best.  R-rated but innocent and sweet.  Definitely worth seeing in theaters.  Way better than the American Pie films.  On par with Risky Business.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
great movie-going experience,"Everyone looks for something different in a movie.  Some people want to be frightened, some people want to be mentally challenged, some people want to be shocked.  Personally, the kind of movie that I like most is the one that leaves with a good feeling not just as you leave the theater, but for the rest of the day.  Girl Next Door did that for me.  Let me start by saying that I'm not a high school kid who wishes that I had more fun and crazy times, and I'm not a college kid lamenting missed opportunities in high school.  I'm just a regular 20-something, the demographic at which I can only assume this rated R film was aimed (they don't make any money off under-aged teens sneaking in after buying a ticket for another movie.).  I think what made this movie so enjoyable was not high school reminiscence but two very valuable take home messages.  First, sometimes the greatest things that happen to us are the ones we don't expect.  Second, at the end of the day, its not money, prestige or accomplishments that really make us happiest, but people.  Will this movie solve any of your life's problems? I doubt it.  However, you will get some solid laughs and you'll leave the theater feeling good about the fact that sometimes in life, despite ups and downs, everything comes together to make something great.I would feel remiss if I didn't also say something about the greatness that is Elisha Cuthbert.  I watch a lot of movies, and movies are chock full of really beautiful women (perhaps one of the reasons I watch so many movies). Elisha is a cut above the rest.  Way above the rest.  In fact, if you are Elisha Cuthbert, and you have penchant for talking about how great you are, feel free to send me a message, and I would be happy to oblige.  Seriously though, it went beyond appearance and to how she played the role.  I think she did an impressive job of creating a character that was at the same time sympathetic but also believable.  I think the movie overall was both well cast and well acted.  A movie that aims at humor/drama/romance can easily come out cheesy or just not funny.  In this case, I think that the movie is all kinds of funny but certainly doesn't overdo it, and the actors deserve credit for that.Before I conclude, I think that I should say something about claims that this movie is just a rip off of classic 80's movies.  Personally, I have to disagree.  I know the classic 80's teen drama's quite well.  I watched from about 100 yards away as John Hughes and company filmed Cameron and Ferris launching the infamous Ferrari into the ravine (my friends and I used to go down there and look for Ferrari parts on weekends for years afterwards.). Risky Business was filmed primarily in the house of a family friend.  To those that think that Girl Next Door draws too heavily from movies like these, I can say only this: you see what you are looking for.  If you go into a film thinking that it will be a rip off, nine times out of ten you will see it as a rip off.  If you go in with an open mind, you may enjoy it more than you thought.Of course, these are all just the opinions of one man.  Well, to be fair, me and the group of 15 year olds in front of me at the box office that all bought tickets for The Prince and Me and then snuck into Girl Next Door and ended up sitting in front of me.  They seemed to like it a lot too.10/10 - purely for providing me with some of the best fun I have had in a theater in months, and if you knew me, you would know that is saying quite a lot.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
A sweet and naughty movie,"I loved this movie, because it was sweet, funny and naughty! It started out good, no bad jokes and it lasted through the whole movie. You never know what is gonna happen next, never a boring moment.

She is this sweet and very good looking girl. But (for some people) she got a bad history she is trying to escape from. And this is the beginning of his morally downfall...The bonus in this movie, is that if you don't know what love is, then listen to him speaking about ""Moral fiber"".

Sure, if you're intimidated by the idea of the porn industry, this movie may turn you off.  But for people with some maturity, this movie is a real undiscovered gem.  And while it definitely has a few teen-aged fantasy moments, it also portrays the young leads very truthfully in terms of the awkwardness of that age.  It's not just some mindless, stupid teen comedy like American Pie; it actually has respect for its characters and cares about them, and portrays their emotional struggles quite truthfully.

One of those movies that make you feel something,"I watched this movie for the first time when I was around 15 and I fell in love with it, literally. I finished it, loved it, and I wanted to keep watching, I wanted more, I felt sad that it ended, I felt some kind of emptiness inside of me, like I had just said goodbye to a part of me, I wanted to cry. Then I watched interviews, behind the scenes videos, I investigated the cast, and after days of consuming everything there is related to this film, I felt the same. I watched the movie a couple more times, I even decided to watch a whole show starring Elisha Cuthbert (Danielle), ""The Ranch"", as I was in love with her, too.Now I'm 20, and I just finished watching the film again, and I feel the exact same way, only now I know what it means and what to do about it. I believe I feel this way because for 100 minutes I felt like I was part of that story, as it's so familiar to me. What teenage guy hasn't dreamt of a sexy girl becoming your neighbor, then be friends with her and make her fall in love with you just by being yourself, a normal and boring guy who has never done anything interesting in his life.This film works that ""girl next door"" concept perfectly. It's a perfect teenage movie that every guy should see (and I suppose girls too but I don't know of any who has). The cast is amazing, specially Elisha Cuthbert (Danielle) who is so beautiful here it's hard to even understand. The soundtrack is amazing. The storyline is perfect as well as the ending. There's nothing missing and nothing that should be here. The philosophy is real.I give it a 9/10 because there's nothing wrong with it, except a few details that aren't even worth mentioning. However, in my heart it's a 100, definitely gonna watch it again some time, like I said, when I finish it it feels like I'm saying goodbye, so all that's left to do is say hello again every now and then.WATCH IT!

Better than American Pie!,"I went into the theater expecting just another teen sex romp and thats half of what I got, but there was more to the story than sex. It had many hilarious moments, the sad moments were believable and not just stupid. I was also expecting more nudity but it was quiet mild, the sexual content is what you have to worry about. Emile Hirsh was damn good and Paul Dano as Klitz was great. The stunning Elisha Cuthbert was awesome, I swear her smile could light up a room a thousand feet underground. All around The Girl Next Door is a great teen comedy, the director stepped up about fifty stairs from The Animal. This movie in my opinion makes American Pie look like a fly and The Girl Next Door the spider. This is a movie I could watch again and again, the soundtrack was also great. This movie is up there in my opinion with Animal House and Fast Time at Ridgemont High.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

In comparison to the movies you think this movie would be like (ie The Scary Movie Trilogy, Not Another Teen Movie, etc) it was really like them in the sense that you could see it had somewhere to go instead of someone to make fun of.

The movie had a lot of stuff that could have been better, but it's still a fun movie without the typical gross out teen sex comedy stuff.

The story and relationship between Matthew and Danielle is good enough to make you forget the weak parts of the movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Classic,"Eventhough I was too lazy to see this the first day of release as planned, I still made it to the theaters. If I could sum this movie up to any teenager in one word, I would let one word roll out of my mouth, that word is classic. As bieng a fan of these types of movies, once I saw this movie I havent been able to wipe the smile off my face. When you have a young cast you would expect for nothing more than a horrible movie, such as Summer Catch. Yet that movie didn't really have a plot, I would definately say I would watch The Girl Next Door an infinate amount of times before I would watch Summer Catch again. This movie adds a little Romance, Comedy, and momentary amounts of Suspense. While watching this movie, through the twists and turns, I kept asking myself what can they think of next to make this movie keep getting better and better. This movie starts and ends strong and I would reccomend it to anyone over the age of 14. **NOTE** this movie does have some adult themes as you can see from the plot. Some Nudity also, but NOT Elisha Cuthbert. Sorry Boys, I was hoping also =) just kidding. Im Out.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
surprisingly good,"As far as the teen comedy genre goes, this is one of the best ones I've seen in a long time. Sure, there's the usual themes (boy meets girl, boy loses girl, losers vs football players, etc.) but somehow I didn't mind so much. There's enough of original stuff to keep the story interesting. Even the sexual references and nudity seemed more mature, more justifiable than one would normally expect. It's also a very funny movie, and in a surprisingly intelligent way. The best thing about it though, is the fact that the plot is not excruciatingly predictable. In fact I found it rather surprising.I can see why some people are put off by the middle section of the film, or by some of the plot twists. But let's face it, if you're worried about the credibility of the plot of a teen comedy, then you're just not having any fun. This ain't The Maltese Falcon, this is light viewing.

It was infact pretty funny, with enough comedic scenes throughout to keep it going. Not only that, but it also had meaning and was pretty dramatic at times. I feel that this movie in one way or another can relate to everyone. Anyway.... by now you all should know that the actress, Elisha Cuthbert is drop-dead gorgeous.

This movie is much more than it appears to be.,"A surprising movie.  It's got some silliness, some convenient answers and some glossing over... but more importantly it has a soul, and that overcomes those weaknesses.Emile Hirsh plays Matthew, an overachieving ""A"" student, president of his Senior class and bound for Georgetown University and a big life as a politician down the road.  But when he tries to find a way to answer the yearbook question ""I will always remember..."", he fails miserably.  He has nothing to remember, because his life is too static.  He watches the jocks, and particularly the girls that the jocks are with, and wishes that he was enjoying this successful life of his a bit more.And, as tends to happen in movies like this, when he gets his wish, it's almost too much to handle.  A beautiful new girl, Danielle (Elisha Cuthbert), moves into the house of her vacationing Aunt next door. Danielle strips in front of her open window--with an amazed Matthew watching from HIS window--and when she turns around and catches him she immediately re-dresses and comes over to confront him in front of his parents. But instead of telling on him, she uses the excuse that she's new in town and needs someone to show her around.  Danielle drives Matthew out to a mostly deserted street, kicks him out of the car, and insists HE strip for her.Matthew does... and over the next few days finds himself increasingly involved with this mysterious girl.  For her part, Danielle seems to make it some kind of mission to loosen Matthew up, in a sequence of more and more daring ways.But for all of Danielle's bad girl ways... she essentially still seems sweet and if not exactly innocent, at least normal.  She tells Matt that she's moved away from her old life and is just looking for a new start.  But Matt's impressions of her come crashing down when his somewhat sex-obsessed friend, Eli, pulls him aside and shows him a video tape.  Matthew's mystery girl is ON the tape. Matthew's girl is a teenaged porno star.This is all just the setup--not all that deep into the film.  The REAL plot of the movie--the real heart--builds on this with how Matt deals with his new knowledge about Danielle, how Danielle deals with Matt, and what the film tries to tell us about who these people really are, as opposed to who they are expected to be.  Matt's pretty future comes crashing down around him, and Danielle's past threatens them both in the form of her former boyfriend/""producer"" Kelly (Timothy Olyphant).The film is more reminiscent of ""Fast Times At Ridgemont High"" or ""Risky Business"" than more ""modern"" teen films like ""American Pie"" or even the wave of John Hughes films which came between these two.  Sex is ever-present, although the film is not explicit--with the exception of a few pairs of breasts in a strip club and some strong language and suggestion.  And the sex trades are neither panned nor lauded, although there are certainly implications that the teenaged Danielle has been exploited, and desperately needs to get out.  The moral center of the film has nothing to do with pornography though, it has much more to do with sacrifice, friendship, and the desire to better yourself.  And if it gets a bit heavy-handed near the end with some of this... it's given you enough to laugh and think about up to that point to deserve some leeway.Of particular note in this film is Elisha Cuthbert, who does surprisingly more than her fairly wooden performance as Kim on ""24"".  Danielle could have been a glossy fantasy girl, played without depth or warmth, but Cuthbert brings both in spades.  Rather than be disgusted or even just excited by Danielle and her choices, Cuthbert allows us to see what it cost her, what she's managed to regain from Matthew, and what she fears losing again. It's a deep performance which is more the actress than the script, and it doesn't hurt that she plays the sexy parts extremely well too.Also great is Chris Marquette, as Eli, who will give you quite a shock with his performance if all you know him from is his slightly sacharine role as Adam on ""Joan of Arcadia"".",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
The Hughes Torch,"For those who enjoyed John Hughes teenage angst movies such as the Breakfast Club and Sixteen Candles and the raunchy trilogy of American Pie, this will be right down your alley. The leads Emile Hirsch, Elisha Cuthbert, Timothy Olyphant, Chris Marquette and Paul Dano carry themselves very strongly, almost to the disadvantage of the rest of the cast who become vital structurally, but otherwise completely unnoticeable. There is an occasional violent tone to this movie that clashes bizarrely with its otherwise comedic nature and the scenes are very disturbing. Additionally dream sequences are blended with real-time sequences, for occasionally comedic, sometimes freakish effect. Timothy Olyphant almost steals the show as a sociopathic porn producer who you never quite know if you want to cheer on or wish he were dead.Hirsh and Cuthbert mix quite well, blending the finding and losing of innocence with a pleasant sincerity. Chris Marquette comes across as a young John Laroquette type character from ""Night Court"", and is entertaining. Borderline on visibility, but filling in when he does, is Paul Dano. Visually and scriptwise the movie is a lot of fun throughout, and tries to avoid wading in its own sincerity too much. The 'unrated' version hardly seems to need to be unrated, and I'm not precisely sure what separates this movie from a modest R rating. A 7.5 on a 100 point scale and a flat 8 on a 10 point.Damion Crowley",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
pleasantly surprised,"As a huge fan of all that is John Hughes, it was no surprise to discover certain homages paid to its teen movie predecessors. Even in the score of the film there was the underlying beat of that Risky Business mood music (or something closely resembling it) in key scenes with Emile.In a film that could have easily turned to garbage with boobs and butts galore, the filmmakers never forgot that what we were dealing with here, is simply two kids trying to be comfortable in their own skin. They discover a balance in each other and fall head over heels. And why wouldn't they? I can't remember the last time in any recent release where two characters were able to communiccate so much through their facial expressions and eyes.So what if the premise is far-fetched. We could all pick apart the logistics of such a scenario with its ridiculous improbabilities. However, the reason we all fork over our hard earned money at the box office or in rentals or in cable subscriptions is that we want to be entertained. This movie does just that and was in no way the predictable teen farce that Hollywood usually cranks out.7/10",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
You Gotta Go!,"So I've been bringing a different friend to the theater every weekend to see this movie.  It hasn't received a bunch of hype and it looks as though many critics aren't fully appreciating this film.  I had seen the trailer online months ago and was looking forward to seeing it just because of the ""carrot on a stick"" T&A factor (hey, I can be honest with myself) and the oh-so-cute Elisha Cuthbert.But then the release date was pushed (and then again, if I remember correctly) so it wasn't until I was killing some time and saw it was playing as a sneak preview one weekend that I finally got to see it.  I gotta tell you, I wasn't expecting much in the way of story or plot... or even acting, just some cheap jokes that hopefully be worth my $9 and to see what it could have been like if a porn star had moved in next door (cruel fate!).Man, was I surprised!  I haven't laughed that hard in a theater in a long time.  And rather than just showcasing hot chicks as porn stars or objects it reminded me of what it was like to have a crush and fall in love back in high school (with a little added fantasy factor).  I left that theater feeling really great and with renewed faith that ""teen sex comedies"" can contain a real sense of romance rather than just ""poop and fart"" jokes.So I've been doing my part to make sure I get as many people as I can to check it out and so far they've all loved it!  I want to make sure that Hollywood makes more of these kind of movies and less of those ""gross-out comedies"".  So...  You Gotta Go!",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

the best of its genre,"i just saw the girl next door a few days ago, and to state it short and sweet, it quite simply rules. i loved everything about the movie, from beginning to end. i think the acting was incredible, as much on the part of elisha cuthbert *who did an even better job in this movie than in 24, were she rules too*, emile hersh and all the supporting cast. the chemistry between the characters was amazing, and they really managed to convey a certain mood through out the movie that to me was one of the best aspects of the picture. as i watched the movie, i became part of the movies world, because the movie really shows what it is like to be a horny teenager in high school.although i enjoy them, i usually don't think romantic comedies or highschool comedies are all that great. this movie is different. it goes beyond the usual limitations of this genre, it is so much more than any of the American pie movies, for example. the movie is excellent and i will see it again as soon as it comes out on DVD or airs on cable.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Excellent movie about the difficulties a male teenager face.,"This is a really great movie. It has a wonderful soundtrack and the whole movie feels real. You understand Matthew as he struggles to become ""cool"". The director greatly succeeds in describing how Matt feels and reacts on different things. The actors feels very real as they speak a lot with there mime expressions. This is not a regular American Pie movie, it is a lot more realistic and not just happy movie. Much because of how the director works with the mime expressions, camera angles and soundtrack. I also recommend everyone to watch the movie with director commentaries on.

Oh Elisha Cuthbert...your pouty looks make my heart melt,"Elisha Cuthbert. What more can I say? This cute little sex-kitten is the best thing to come out of Canada since Brian Adams. As for this film? It was good enough for me to take the time to comment on, so that is certainly saying something.The Girl Next Door goes against a couple of long standing norms in that it is: A)	A creative, engaging coming-of-age flick B)	A classy film about pornGranted, Elisha Cuthbert could stand in front of a camera making pouty lip-faces and giggle that cute little laugh of hers for 75 minutes and the film could gross 75 million, but this movie just inexplicably `did it' for me, no pun intended...the plot was able to stand on its own.The imagination that this film inspires: the notion that a moment of serendipity can await an unsuspecting, worthy person is what really inspired me. This movie also managed to avoid the majority of the teen romance clichés, which is certainly a good thing. I gave this one an unequivocal 10 rating: Not only did Elisha Cuthbert make this film great, but the plot was quite impressive too, as I certainly wasn't expecting much.And the best part about this movie? Freddie Prinze Jr. wasn't in it. Instead, some kid who looks like he belongs in a Harry Potter movie got some actiononly in the movies ;o)",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Good Movie,"I thought this movie was very good, the acting was great, and having Ms. Cuthbert play one of the main characters was a great idea.

A great cast to go with a great movie.  My compliments, even though they may not mean much, go to the actors/actresses and directors/producers and everyone else involved in making this movie.

Great Movie - Classic,"Just got back from seeing this movie during a special screening and I was really surprised on how great this movie is.  I did not know hardly anything about this film until I went and saw it - it was great.  Elisha Cuthbert, Emile Hirsch, and Timothy Olyphant (really great) were outstanding.  The movie is in the same category as the cult classics from the 80s such as Risky Business, Sixteen Candles, and Ferris Bueller.  It also has the flavor of American Pie but I feel this movie is right up there with or better than American Pie.  My wife and I highly enjoyed this film and we both highly recommend it.  It will surprise you how good it really is.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Great film,"As a matter of fact, in the beginning I had no desire to watch this film, because I was expecting some new American stupid teen-comedy, but, finally, this is turned to be one of the coolest and most interesting romantic films I have ever seen. I actually like this film because of such beautiful girl as Elisha Cuthbert, who took really hard role to be performed with passion and devotion. Matthew's character looks familiar to many American and European teens. He did not miss his once-in-a-life chance to meet his ideal girl",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Homage to Risky Business...,"I loved this film! First let me add a disclaimer-- ""Risky Business"" is one of my top 5 movies of all time. I would be very easily jaded by any film that attempted to remake such a classic. But I was not jaded by ""The Girl Next Door,"" because- for once- they did not merely attempt to remake a great film- rather, they paid homage to one by making an equally entertaining movie in the spirit of ""Risky Business"" that speaks to a new generation. It is also a film worthy of comparison to some of John Hughes' classics like ""Weird Science"" and ""Pretty in Pink."" Sure, it has some minor structural flaws here and there, but, overall, this film is so funny, the characters so endearing, and the set pieces so outrageous that I was downright ready to jump out of my seat with excitement over how much fun I was having watching this. I haven't felt this way about a film in years! Come to think of it, I haven't felt this way about a film since I watched ""Risky Business."" Thanks for taking me back in time and reaffirming that those same emotions are still alive and strong today. And what a soundtrack!! Sneaker Pimps, Filter, The Who, The Verve, Marvin Gaye- coupled with songs from the great ""Risky Business"" soundtrack like Muddy Waters' Mannish Boy and Tangerine Dream cues as well. Who could ask for much more?-- Except maybe more Elisha Cuthbert! Rebecca DeMornay, time to step aside, I now remember what it feels like to be infatuated again. And a star making turn from Emile for sure. Great job to everyone involved. Studios execs, please take note- this is proof that the word `teenager' does not have to defined as dumb. Movie lovers- check this one out for pure, clever fun!",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
What its really about,"I just got back from seeing this movie at the theater this afternoon and I must say I really enjoyed it. I liked alot of the small details which I wont get into, but I wanted to comment on the main theme of the movie as I saw it. The movie, not unlike alot of other films before it, illustrates that life often surprises you when you least expect it and that sometimes you have to break free of your restraints, take some chances...on both ideas and people, to change your life for the better. This movie was great in showing the growth of the characters throught the movie, particularly Matt. Its an inspiring tale about how people very much unlike you can change you for the better. I do recognize it is quite a rip off of Risky Business, with a little different spin, particularly with the mushy-mushy lovey dovey stuff (which I liked). And to top it off, I think the visuals were very pleasing to the eye.I dont mean ""The Girl"". I mean Emile and Paul. Nice. This is one I will surely be getting on DVD.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Good Movie,"I saw this movie this Saturday Sneak Preview Style. I was looking forward to seeing this movie for a long time. When the movie was done and I exited the theatre, I felt a sense of happiness. This happiness did not stem from a good movie but rather Elisha Cuthbert. I wasn't aware how beautiful this girl was till this movie. She really did make the movie for me. Let me be honest, I am a sap for Romantic Comedies and when I first saw the trailer, it looked like the perfect movie. It had a beautiful girl and a nerdy boy in a funny but quirky situation who fall in love. The perfect Romantic Comedy.As the movie goes on, it has many funny moments and I was rather entertained by it for the whole 2 hours. I'm not going to lie to you, this movie has its flaws. It seems like its going to end many times before it finally actually ends. I personally did not mind the movie going on as long as it did. It means more Elisha Cuthbert. I never realized how beautiful this girl is till this movie. She makes the movie. Brilliant casting job. Plot...not really plausible but who goes to watch a movie for its realism?? Simply Put...The Girl Next Door is definitely worth spending your money on. You will enjoy it.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
A cute and funny comedy at the same time that goes big!,"The movie starts out with teenager Matthew Kidman who is on his way to graduate from high school, his problems seem to be that everyone has has memorable moments and have done some wild things and he is just the plain type looking for something big, also he is trying to get a scholoarship to Georgetown University, toward the end of his senior year at high school, no other than Danielle (Elisa Cuthbert) the bombshell who moves right next to Matt's house to housesit. This is when the fun starts kicking in, there's romance and there is a lot of fall out of your chair laughing parts in this movie along with a great soundtrack with David Bowie, U2 and others. This movie beats out the American pie trilogy and it seems so more like an 80's romance movie with some wicked humour involved which pays off well. Moviegoers should take note this isn't just a movie about what teenager has sex first and all that stuff, this movie does have a nice meaning and it plays it off well, the replay value on this is great, Great actors, Great moments, and memorable one liners.

Pretty Woman -- but not as Sleazy,"I remember when I watched ""Pretty Woman"" for the first time. I was appalled at how everyone loved Richard Gere and how it was touted as the greatest romantic comedy of all time. I seemed to be the only person who was creeped out by the fact that Gere was only into Julia's character for the sex! He was paying her for sex and dressing her up to make her presentable! At the end, I half expected him to say, ""sorry, I have to go home to my wife in New York now."" THAT would have been an interesting story.Enter ""The Girl Next Door."" Very similar storyline except our hero, Matt, is blissfully unaware of Danielle's past. He falls for her because of who she is. It's when he finds out she's a porn star that things start to crumble. Then she goes back to it, but Matt chases after and tells her ""you're better than this.""This story of love, grace, jealousy and forgiveness reminds me a lot of the story of Gomer from the Bible (in the book of Hosea, for those interested -- tiny little book at back of the Old Testament). It was story about love. It has teen comedy elements, but it's real and raw at times that help transcend the genre that belongs to American Pie, Porky's and the like.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
This girl can live next door to me anytime.,"I went in to this film expecting nothing really> I had read bad reviews and wasnt optimistic.  Much to my surprise good old Roger Ebert was out to lunch again.  To old to connect with a film like this.  Not since his review of mallrats (1.5/4) has he been so out to lunch.  I think Mallrats is one of the funniest and best comedies of the 90s and one of my fave films of all time, much like this film that ebert also gave a 1.5.  I thought this film had a great concept, good pacing, I laughed quite often, and I liked the cast and how the characters were developed.  There were certainly moments where you questioned a characters motivations but the film makers redemed their actions in the end.  This is certainly not a perfect film and flaws it does have but still a film I am still thinking about more than a week after seeing it and hoping the DVD has great features.

All of the performances are right on especially Emile's film school friend.  Luke Greenfield has done a spectacular job writing/ directing this film.  While one realizes that this film is incredibly hard to market, one must also come to the understanding that this film should catch on likewildfire once the word gets out there.

best coming-of-age flick since 'Risky Business',"[three caveats before i begin: (1) i'm a guy whose background is eerily similar to Emile Hirsch's, before Elisha Cuthbert enters the scene. (2) beyond the romance and ultimate message of the film, women may be offended by the sexuality and preponderance of porn culture. (3) some suspension of disbelief, as with virtually any Hollywood movie, is required to thoroughly appreciate this film.]this film is superb.  i haven't seen a male coming-of-age flick of this quality since Tom Cruise's 'Risky Business'.  that's saying a lot.the box office figures and reviews so far probably don't match this opinion, but for those of you, particular young heterosexual male viewers, who can relate to the overachieving, A+, unpopular, prestigious college-bound kid, who secretly hopes to experience wild and crazy things, but never actually doing so...this flick will strike a chord.verdict: 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
A smart teen sex comedy?,"Just saw The Girl Next Door in a preview screening in Toronto and it's a surprisingly smart and sensitive teen sex comedy. 24's Elisha Cuthbert is beautiful and almost nude but also subtle as Danielle, the ex-porn star who moves in next to Matthew (The Dangerous Life of Altar Boys' Emile Hirsch), a straight-arrow high school senior determined to live it up a little bit now that he's been accepted into Georgetown University. There's enough T&A to keep the frat boys entertained, but The Girl Next Door, despite a couple of lapses in narrative logic, prevails thanks to the enthusiasm of its leads and a remarkably candid approach to sex not mired in heavy-handed moralism, a condition prevalent in these post-Janet Jackson/Boobgate times. Kudos to Timothy Olyphant as Danielle's alternately charming and menacing porn producer.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
A lot better than I thought it would be.,"OK, I'll be the firs to to admit. There's only one reason I went to see this film - her name is Elisha Cuthbert. I know, I'm shallow, but I just felt like going to see her looking good for about 2 hours. Is that a crime? The only crime here is that this film has been judged according to the main actress, when to my surprise, this was actually a very entertaining, funny and heartwarming film.I expected the usual fare that has been seen oh-so-many times before. Yes, you can guess what happens in terms of the romance, (boy meets girl, boy gets girl, boy loses girl, boy gets girl back again) but there was just more to this film than the others I have seen from the same genre. (You would have to class this as teenage romantic comedy I'm afraid.) Elisha is very good as an ex-porn star trying to lead a normal life, and Emile Hirsch is a very good choice as Matt, the intelligent student guy who wants to be cool, but for me the best performances are by Matt's two best friends, Eli and Klits. (with a K!) Eli had me in stitches a few times.Also, the film's music was excellent. Look out for the soundtrack, should be a very worthwhile purchase.Overall, a very entertaining film that is well worth seeing.Mojo's Filter - two big double D sized thumbs up.

very awesome movie,"I loved this movie. It was awesome. You would expect it to be another lame teen sex comedy, but it's anything but. Matthew Kidman(Hirsch)is a geeky student. He's student council president, you know, the typical nerd with his two cronies Eli(Marquette) and Klitz(Dano). Matthew finds the girl next door irresistible and falls in love with her. But to his dismay, finds out that she used to be a porn star. When he finds out, he freaks out and she decides to leave him and take up her old job again. He realizes that he will do anything for her and sets out on a quest to get her back. But unfortunately, her ""manager,"" Kelly(Olyphant)stands in his way. Through all the obstacles, Matthew still wants her back. If you are looking for a cheesy teen sex comedy along the lines of American Pie or Not Another Teen Moive, look elsewhere. While still involving sex(come on, the movie is about pornstars), it is also about the love he feels for Danielle(Cuthbert).",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Good, unclean fun!","I set up an IMDb account mainly because i wanted to air my feelings about this movie after watching it recently. When a little unhappy i hired this film out and gave it a chance, despite my recent cynicism towards the American teen-flick genre. However, after a good half an hour of watching this movie a began to see that a little more time had been taken to make this movie stand out from others, this was down to several factors; 1) the film stars no real ""A-List celebrities"", not only giving new actors a chance to show how good they really are, but giving you a clean view of the role they had undertaken for this movie, in transition to other actors, i.e Sean William Scott, spending the entirety of any post-American Pie movie he's starred in, NOT to be like Stifler. 2) the story. It's well written, with subtle plot twists, allowing for you to sometimes spot whats about to happen before it does, and though some people would say thats a negative, though it leaves me feeling quite pleased with myself. 3) talented, young actors. The supporting acting done by Matthew Kidman's (Emile Hirsche) two best friends, managing to play nervous, uncomfortable, and studd.

Even with some success early on, they don't grow into jocks all of a sudden but keep their weaknesses to the end, fighting in their own way. This, to me, is also the message at the end.

Shockingly Good,"Just saw ""The Girl Next Door"" tonight, and I must say I was pleasantly surprised.  The trailers made it look like a real teen flick, in the style of American Pie or Porkys or something, but that's not the way it came out. The acting was right on in every scene.  Even most of the secondary characters were just right.  The characters who really stood out were some of the secondary ones, like the main character's best friends and Danielle's producer.  The music fits great, and the movie twists in some good surprises.  My prognosis is that this movie is being marketed to the wrong audience ala ""The Rules of Attraction"" and that if it fails it's because it is being advertised to teen moviegoers, not older romantic comedy watchers.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

The fantasies of the Matthew character (played by Emile Hirsch) are hilarious, like when he first discovers that Danielle (Elisha Cuthbert) is a porn star and finds her on the couch with his parents. The interaction between the best friends is a lot of fun too, especially when they go to the porn convention in Las Vegas.I really liked Elisha Cuthbert in this movie too.  I've never watched 24, so my only real exposure to her was as the boss's daughter in Old School and the ""Hot american girl who loves british accents"" in Love Actually. I'll admit that part of my liking her is because she's very very easy on the eyes, but she's able to play this role and have fun with it, which is always a plus.And it also has an awesome soundtrack.  Gotta love a well placed inclusion of The Who.Probably the best teen movie I've seen since the first American Pie.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
I must say...,"I must say that I LOVED ""The Girl Next Door."" Not only was it absolutely hilarious, there were plenty of beautiful women to go around.  First off, Elisha Cuthbert is my new girlfriend.  She was absolutely sexy, and charming in this movie. Matt's friend Eli was hysterical throughout the movie.  Overall this movie was great.  This movie is perfect for any occasion. Although a bit cliche love/teen movie at times, I highly recommend this movie to any and everyone.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
A Refreshing Break from the Traditional Teen Comedy,"While although knowingly remaking Risky Business and containing elements from both American Pie and Weird Science, this movie is very unique and in a class of its own. While of course containing the hilarious raunchy behavior necessary for a teen comedy, it also contains surpisingly good acting, timely one-liners, an intriguing story and a fantastic soundtrack.  The editing and use of music in this movie is amazing.  The story takes a look into the life of Matthew Kidman (Hirsch), an overlooked, overachieving high school senior who draws a blank when reflecting on his time in high school, shortly before graduation.  His life suddenly changes when Danielle (Cuthbert), a beautiful and free spirited teen moves in next door to house-sit for her aunt.  They immediately fall in love because they see things in each other that no one else sees.  Their relationship is thrown a curveball by Matt's discovery that Danielle is a porn star trying to find a way out.  The rest of the movie is Matt's quest to break Danielle out of the industry, much to the chagrin of her charismatic but overprotective porn producer Kelley (Olyphant).  The movie then takes many more twists and turns and Matt brings his nerdy but adventurous sidekicks along for the ride, thus providing many moments of comic relief. The movie has many endearing qualities, and belongs in a genre by itself.  All in all it is a great tale of living up to one's potential and can relate to people of all ages.  A must see",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Chick Flick that guys will love...,"This movie was great. It's a feel good movie. Obviously it's not a movie expected to be seen at the academy awards and I think Roger Ebert's review is completely missing the point. This is a TEEN COMEDY, not an intellectual drama. I cracked up when I watched this movie, and it had it's ''touching'' moments. The cast is flawless. Particularly the ridiculously beautiful and perfect Elisha Cuthbert. Every time I saw her on the screen my heart was beating faster and faster. Even the women who play the porn stars are gorgeous. Emile Hirsch is great and believable Matthew Kidman, Timothy Olyphant is one of my favorite villains in a comedy (perfect sleezball), and Chris Marquette and Paul Dano were hilarious as Matthew's two nerdy best friends. The movie all in all was really cute and funny. It made me think about high school and what memories I'll have when I'm done. This is definately gonna be a classic teen comedy for me. Ahh if only Elisha Cuthbert moved next door to me...   10/10PS. Watching The Girl Next Door made me fall in love with Elisha Cuthbert...I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE HER IN HER NEXT ROLE...",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Basically just an updated ""Risky Business""","I've never bothered to comment, but I read the last persons comments and completely disagree.  This was a very good movie.  It's basically just Risky Business, but with porn stars, and no Balki Bartocamus.  Balki needs to be in more movies.  Someone should make a movie with Balki and Alf, and maybe that girl from small wonder.  Most of the monkies that watch movies in theaters will laugh at just about anything, but I found myself laughing along with them once or twice.  The only complaint I have is that Elisha Cuthbert didn't show her boobies.  She's playing a pornstar for f**ksakes, show some nipple!  Come to think of it, I don't think there was any nudity in this movie.  That last scene should have had her doing some Bukkake. Definately worth seeing. 8/10.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Sweet, cute and seductive",Incredibly alluring girl meets the teen next door in this over the top American teen flick. Yes it's strange it's a bunch of truly unrealistic hormonally driven high school seniors with a prom and party thrown in abs some good old plastic fake women thrown in. Is daft the story is lame.

Surprising !,"I watched this movie last nite, and I have 2 say it was awesome. At first I thought it was gonna be just another teen movie, and DAMN - it surprised me alot. This movie sure gave a lot of funny scenes. And, definetely, some touching scenes. A great romantic comedy 2 be seen here. The soundtrack is pretty good also, too bad it didn't include the single from David Grey - ""This Years Love"" (from the first kiss, and limo scenes). I would recommend this movie definetely. I have 2 say that it is one of my favorite movies I've seen, too bad it didn't make it top 5 of the week, but ppl should've give it a chance, I bet they would've find this movie pretty interesting and good.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Wait one sec on the bad comment, this movie was GREAT!","I had the privilege of seeing this movie three weeks before it comes out to audiences around the world and it was perhaps the funniest and most genuinely uplifting movie I have seen in years.  Now perhaps my attraction to the heroine, Elisha Cuthbert or my rapport to the main character, Emile Hirsch blinded me to the trite plot, but this movie did not lack comedy. The only time I did not hear the entire audience laughing was when the credits were rolling.  Furthermore, while walking out of the theater I overheard numerous people wishing the movie came out sooner so they could go see it again.I admit that one does not have to think during this movie, but thank god for that.  There are too many overly artsy, pseudo-intellectual, ""I think I'm smart because I go to this movie,"" Films today.  The Girl Next Door is fun to go to, has a wonderful plot, is written quite well and has amazingly good acting from a bunch of no names especially Timothy Olyphant.   Frankly, the person who doesn't like this movie is probably stick-in-the-mud that shouldn't be going to this type of movie anyway.  If you don't like witty comedy, original characters or a quick and smart plot, do not go to this movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
A classic not appreciated enough!,"Don't understand why it's not appreciated enough, but at the same time I do understand why. I think that sometimes we should not just dwell on the surface but try to go deeper and deeper, especially when it comes to movies. To the people who say that it has a ""man"" point of view and that maybe Danielle should've had a stronger voice, I say that actions speak louder than words, in fact, the choice and choices she makes send a very strong and important message, which I think has been represented with a very deep, soft and obvious comedic approach, with that inevitable magical touch of early 2000s movies. I believe that the message sent here is very important and is a great story of redemption, of course lightened by the comedic tone; you have to dig deeper, especially when it comes to comedies. For this very reason I appreciated the movie even more.It grabbed from the first minutes, not just because of the themes and plot, but because the characters are just so well-built and unique. Amazing acting. Timothy Olyphant what a performance. Chris Marquette made me cry of laughter, just so naturally funny - the whole movie was just so funny and entertaining, for me the most important thing in the cinematic experience. The main actors are just perfect for the protagonists' roles with a great on-screen chemistry. I was just rooting for them from the beginning of the movie. For me that's a sign of a great movie and most importantly of a great screenplay: the pacing was immaculate... and those plot twists! Can't say anything about it.Can't say anything as well for the ending, full of plot twists and pure romanticism emphasized by the dreamy Baba O'Riley. Maybe it was all a dream. It felt like it.I guess I'll be dreaming of Elisha Cuthbert (and Emile Hirsch) for quite some time.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Great Movie,"I thought this was one of the best movies of this year.  I saw it about two weeks after it came out.  There wasn't much of a fuss about it so i didn't really think anything of it until my friends and I decided to go check it out.  It turned out to be amazing.  The character Eli's one liners were very funny and Elisha Cuthbert looked amazing.  It did have some crazy ideas that are outlandish.  Also the fact that the ""producer"", Kelly, is like thirty six and Danielle is only 19 and they dated.  Other than that I would say this was a very good movie and very funny.  If you pay attention to Eli he says some hilarious things.  I would definitley recommend this too any teenager looking for a good movie to see on a Friday night.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

Not bad at all!!!!,"I just saw this movie and I have to say that it surprised the heck out of me!, in a good way though. I hadn't seen any trailers or posters for it and usually the liner notes on the cases, be it VHS or DVD is usually a load of Pooh, so all I knew was that it was a romantic teen comedy and it stars a beautiful Elisha Cuthbert and one of my favorite actors Timothy Olyphant. Now usually I'm not into romantic teen comedies but the fact that Timothy Oliphant was in it got me to rent it. And to my great surprise I thought it was quite funny, a little bit sweet and a little grim on occasions. Emile and Elisha really seem to have something going on there that isn't often seen between young actors in a movie such as this, they just click and it seems sincere most of the time. Elisha is well known for her acting in the hit show 24, but I had never heard about Emile Hirsch, I think he'll be big in Hollywood sooner or later, that kid is very good in the movie! OK there is some partial nudity and some strong language at times but all in all I think it's a very good movie!",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

"Move over Porky's and American Pie, you've just been upped","So I've never made a porno film (yet) this movie captures the true escence of high school life down to a very fine ""T"" This movie does for my generation what Riskey bussiness did for the teen's in the 80's: a whacked out sex premise, rauchy and halrious, with a sweet yearning love story. Our story start with Matthew, a high school senior who realizes he has no stories, no real memories of his senior year, that is till he meets Danielle, ""The Girl Next Door"" they soon start dating and have a sugary sweet romamce, that is untill Matthew finds out that Dannille is a one time pornstar, he no longer knows how to treat her and makes a big mistake, then Kelly, Danielle's ""producer"" shows up to wreak havoc, crazy hijinks ensue. truly funny and as light as a cloud to bad this movie wasn't wide recieved.

"Perhaps not exceptional, but certainly a good movie.","I'm not going to say that this is the best movie that I've ever seen or that it should win any Oscars, because than I would be lying. But that doesn't mean that I didn't like the movie.I watched it in the cinema and I must say that I really had a good time, and apparently a lot of people with me, because people were laughing a lot. And no the audience wasn't made up by 90 % of teenagers as you might think. Most of them were adults, just like me.The story is about a young student that has no girlfriend and some weird friends. When the neighbor is on holiday, a nice girl comes to take care of the house. They get to know each other and like each other, but she has a secret that she wants to keep for herself: in LA she is a porn star.The story and the acting are nice (especially Timothy Olyphant as her bad manager was very nice). Overall the movie worked for me. It had its flaws, but the talented cast and the many laughs in addition to the dramatic scenes made this a movie to remember.

Something about the porn industry.,"Honestly, who has never seen a porn movie? What would have happened if you met an actor from these movies? I have to say very interesting and this movie tells about it.Good actors were selected for the main roles. Elisha Cuthbert and Emile Hirsch mastered their task very well. A slightly different love story is very fun and entertaining. You don't see many movies of this kind and that's why it's something special. The director got everything under one roof and the overall work is very good. If you want to know something about people like this, you can watch this movie. People like this, I mean porn actors. I have to say a very sensitive subject. On the whole, this movie is fun!To come to the conclusion I have to say that it was a very good experience and I learned more about a lot.

"""What's the craziest thing you've done lately""?","With this movie, the juice is defiantly worth the squeeze! This is got to be one of the best comedy/romance movies that I have ever seen. You could almost pass the movie off as a true story. In the Girl Next Door, every young male's dream comes true; an incredibly beautiful girl moves next door and you and her fall in love. Most young guys could connect and relate with Emile Hirch (Matthew Kidman). For me and other young guys I know, this would be a dream come true. It's a shame that love can't always be like this. Both Elisha Cuthbert (Danielle) and Emile Hirch (Matthew Kidman) do a great job portraying their characters. The characters are written very well. Every love scene is incredibly believable. Their acting ability adds to an already great movie. The director, Luke Greenfield, did a great job with The Girl Next Door. This movie shows that two people can fall in love even if one feels that the other is out of his or her league. I would recommend this movie to anyone who wants to see a great comedy or an exceedingly beautiful girl, being Elisha Cuthbert. A note for parents: I would not let anyone under 13 watch this movie.

Immersing,"Sure its got a pretty weird story that may seem like a re hash of Risky Business but don't let that put you off, it's ****ing great! When i first watched it, I was blown away, it had much more depth than I would have expected from a teen movie and you get so immersed and involved with the characters that its unbelievable.Emile Hirsch is great as the nervous nerdy, unsure of himself guy and, I don't really think I need to say this, Elisha Cuthbert is great. Doubtless a lot of guys went to see this just because of her being hot, but her performance is really great- can you imagine how hard it would be to play a cute, lovable, confused aspiring porn star? anyway, its definitely worth seeing, and don't worry if you get the so-called ""Elisha Fever"" which several guys have mentioned in their posts, its pretty normal I think. If you think its sad that some guys watch this film every day, see it for yourself and it might have the same effect on you.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
pure love is more important than everything,teenagers are certainly interested in this type of film that shows pure love can conquest on sexual aptitude and emphasizes on this sentence that love is more complicated that it seems and no matter who is in one side of love he or she can be attracted by whom he or she loves. this film shows that beauty and just sex are not necessary for love they are just tools to join your spirit to your minion and every love is base on these will definitely break. if you like romance film i suggest you not to miss this movie because it can impress you in many ways. it's highlighted to go with someone you like and don't be shy to express your love. you can extract from this movie that faithful love can restrain from unnecessary affair with someone else (you know what i mean).,10.0,Anonymous,Romance

Certain parts were really funny, sad, romantic, happy and aesthetically pleasing for all the right reasons. No matter who you are or what your go to genre is, you must see this I recommend it deeply. The main thing that just gets it for me is that when I heard about the story, I thought that it would be a rubbish comedy about the porn star premise but it was pretty deep and it changed the way I judge films and that is my opinion.

Sexy and edgy – worth seeing,"I was shocked when my wife agreed to go see the sneak preview with me last night, and I anticipated seeing a teenie-bopper sex flick with lots of nudity, poor acting and a bad plot.  I was very pleasantly surprised that The Girl Next Door had such a funny, sexy edge that had us leaving the theater smiling and excited.Elisha Cuthbert (you may know her as Kim Bauer on Fox TV’s “24” series) plays Danielle who is a porn star (aka “Athena”), and she stole the entire show by showing off her near-flawless physical features -- even my wife said she looked amazing! But she can act as well, adding some decent depth to the movie, and the chemistry between Danielle and Matthew (Emile Hirch) grew from an innocent boy’s infatuation to self-sacrificing love.Why did they release a sneak preview three weeks early?  My guess is to help target the female audience.  The male audience is easy to capture here, and the theater had a few singleton males to prove the point.  But there were plenty of females in the audience as well, and men and women alike seemed to laugh at the funny parts.Direction?  Again, surprisingly good for relative newcomer Luke Greenfield. Production-wise, Girl was good.  If I had to complain about anything it would be the editing – not that film editor Livolsi did a poor technical job (I actually love his works) -- but that the decisions of WHAT to cut got a bit sloppy at toward the end of the film.  Everything was moving along wonderfully…. we’re laughing, laughing, ohh! sexy, laughing, movement, movement… and then there were some dead spots. There were a few scenes that perhaps could have been cut in their entirety without any adverse affect on the plot.  Show ‘em on the Deleted Scenes on the DVD!While driving back from the theater, I remarked that the movie somehow felt unique but that I couldn't put my finger on it.  My wife said that it had an American Pie-type humor with all of the innocence of the high school boys trying to get some girls.  I thought that the movie was a good erotic-comedy-romance, with a well-deserved R-rating for some drug use and brief nudity (but not of Elisha Cuthbert) and strong sexual content. Here, the term “strong sexual content” is right on because it really couldn’t get much stronger without being an outright NC-17.  Had the sexiest scenes (and there were plenty) had nudity in them, it would have gone way beyond an R rating!  As it was, it was tastefully done but still highly erotic.Highly recommended.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
