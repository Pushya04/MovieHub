"Flawed and cold, but sharp and haunting.","I've seen Closer described as a cinematic triumph, but it's precisely not. The film wears its theatrical origins on its sleeve, and the presence of the camera is mostly irrelevant.It also fails in a more subtle way. Initially, I watched four apparently amoral people, devoid of depth or shame, being clever at each other in increasingly hurtful and exploitative ways, and my mind rebelled. This can't be right, I thought, people don't talk like this. Hell, people don't *act* like this.Then the light dawned. The characters seemed inhuman because they are. They aren't people at all, they're philosophical positions. When they talk, they're not talking. They're saying the things that people only dare think, asking the questions that haunt anyone whose relationship has gone horrifically pear-shaped. This isn't the story of four people and four relationships, it's an attempt to compress everything the author believes about human relationships into a film and bend it into a story. It feels artificial because it is.With that realisation, I actually began to enjoy it, because Closer is a very clever film. I wish I could disagree with more of it, because many of the things it has to say about human relationships are painfully true. Every mistake you've ever made in a relationship is in here, and it's guaranteed to make you squirm at least once. It's also blackly funny in many places.Without exception, the performances are fantastic, with the honours going to Natalie Portman's emotionally scarred escapist who wears lies like they were armour, and Clive Owen's brutal, perceptive, and ultimately absolutely human dirty doctor.Be warned! The marketing campaign may lead you to think it's a comforting rom-com, but it's not. I wouldn't advise going with your partner unless you're rock-solid. You may leave asking some uncomfortable questions, and wondering how well you really know them...",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Four Great Performances,"Dan (Jude Law), an obituary writer, falls for stripper Alice (Natalie Portman) who is new in London. Later Dan writes a book about Alice, and meets photographer Anna (Julia Roberts). Alice knows she's losing Dan. Dan tricks dermatologist Larry (Clive Owen) on an internet chat, and Larry meets Anna. Larry marries Anna but the wander eye strikes again.Director Mike Nichols is going minimalist with Patrick Marber's play. This is a movie with four incredible performances. Clive Owen is brutal. Natalie Portman is hurt. Jude Law is childish. Julia Roberts is wonderful. They are doing some of their best work here. Don't come for a rom-com. This is emotionally vicious, damaged, pathetic human relationships.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Who's afraid of Closer?,"Mike Nichols directed, in my opinion, one of the three best adaptations from stage to screen. ""Who's afraid of Virginia Woolf"" (The other two being Sidney Lumet's ""Long day's journey into night"" and Elia Kazan's ""A Streetcar named Desire) After the extraordinary television adaptation of ""Angels in America"" I also would have pleaded with Mike Nichols to do ""Closer"" Sorry I'm rambling. What I'm trying to say in a rather convoluted way is, simply, thank you Mr. Nichols. Adult themes, conceived and performed by adult artists. I hope it makes zillions of dollars so we can have more of it. Jude Law is a Peter O'Toole without the steroids, Julia Roberts a Jeanne Moreau with an American passport, Clive Owen is a child of John Garfield and Peter Finch and Natalie Portman a Jean Peters with a college degree. I saw the film twice in a row, I hadn't done that in years. Not since ""Drugstore Cowboy"", ""Apartment Zero"" and ""Sex Lies and Videotape"" The unfolding of the dark happens in front of our eyes and it feels chillingly familiar. Lies we tell each other with so much conviction with so much honesty. The only real thing is the pain and the loneliness. It doesn't sound like a very entertaining night out but believe me, it is. Go, see for yourself. You may have to confront something you didn't want to confront. That's part of the process call growing up. Who's afraid of that?",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
I Love & Hate it,"This movie is a big game of narcissistic people who treat each other as puppets. There is no love, no truth, no good. In the beginning we all try to find a hero in the story, someone to sympathize with only to realize what we have is a bunch of mentally ill people making themselves suffer. Dan (Jude Law) is just a big kid longing for attention and a new toy, which he only cares for about 5 mins. Anna (Julia Roberts) is also desperate for attention and love since her ex left her for a younger girl. She is confused and unreasonable, her ego makes all the decisions instead of her mind. Larry (Clive Owen) is an agressive jerk, playing along Dan's little game, while Alice is just a naive, traumatized, young girl who falls in love and decides to avoid all the red flags and becomes part of this sick 4 some. Brilliant movie. Honestly not the ending what I hoped for tho (I just wanted all 4 of them together in a room while Slim Pickens rides the atom bomb there).",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Rabidly Romantically Unromantic Story about Love and Other Human Frailties,"Because Closer is, in a way, like sneaking a peek behind the closed doors of people we know, or more so, like looking in a mirror when we are at our most base and humanly human, some people seem to be viscerally turned off by it, as is apparent by a few of its more negative reviews.To me, the very fact that it opens the door to such ""voyeurism"", if you will, is part of its deep emotional appeal.Who among us can say we have never been tempted to be lured away from what we believe is love, by what we momentarily believe to be love? In closer, however these moments go beyond temptation, into lies, deceit, infidelity, misery, painful truths, abandonment, tears and suffering. ""Love"", in Closer, is shown to be against everything we've been taught to believe it should be, such as: honest/truthful, enduring, constant ... and faithful.In short, it is a rabidly anti-romantic film, where, unbelievably, somewhere within each of these broken, self-serving, selfish, emotionally-underdeveloped people, brilliantly played by Jude Law, Julia Roberts, Clive Ovens and Natalie Portman, we find beauty, and in the end, a deep satisfaction upon seeing that love of self can lead to release and rebirth.It had been a while since I watched this, and I am happy to say that I loved it this time around as much as the first time I laid eyes on it. And isn't that the mark of real love? That it endures?Closer, is one of my favorite films.9.5",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
The three years of my divorce wrapped into two hours,"While I thought the characters were interesting, I found it very difficult to watch, as my own marriage disintegrated in a fashion too familiar to these characters. The lies, the half-truths, the inability to distinguish truth from lie after being told so many lies. I could completely relate to the characters in this movie.Though I could laugh with it, it was nevertheless painful to watch. I couldn't recommend this movie to anyone except my ex-. Even then, I have trouble believing she's understand any part of it.This particular film was more like a documentary shot without the shaky hand-held camera. But, like the still photographs the movie mocks as being false, Closer allows only glimpses of the truth behind the myriad lies.I want to be entertained at a movie and I cannot think of a single person to whom I'd recommend this movie. It was very well acted, scripted, and executed on all parts. But it was more painful than pleasant or enlightening.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Very good,"I've been hearing lots of negativity about this movie. I think a lot of people have been shocked, frankly, by the raw and rough nature of the film. Having read the play, I've been looking forward to it for about a year now, and it's honestly one of the best plays I've ever read. Mike Nichols presents it in an amazing way, very faithful to the words as they're written (and they should be, for the movie is also written by the man who wrote the play, the brilliant Patrick Marber).It's a brutal topic, sex and love, especially when they're combined. I thought the movie was amazing. It captured all of the vulnerability, caustic harshness, and acerbic flirtation that the play vibrated with. All of the cast brought the movie alive. It uplifts and then brings you way down, but that's the point, and yet at the end, I didn't feel depressed or saddened, just really really awake and curious. It's the feeling you get when you get ""closer"", I suppose.Natalie Portman, in a tour-de-force performance, is the standout by far. Maybe it's because she's the youngest, and not expected to be that awesome, but she is. Anyways, her Alice is flirty and sweet, caustic and manipulative, evasive and yet very open, sexual and gloomy all in one character. She has the best chemistry with the men - whether it be purely sensual with Clive Owen, or innocence and affection with Jude Law. She comes alive with the two guys, and their scenes are ones to look forward to.Julia Roberts, whom everyone looks towards, is not bad in this film. She's very understated and good, but she is outshone in nearly every scene by whomever she's acting with.Clive Owen is absolutely astounding, and he's definitely on everyone's radar screen. As the man of experience and ""simplicity"", as Jude Law's character comments, he's brash and hotheaded, but also extremely clever. Owen perfectly plays the sleazy, unlikeable character, but somehow manages to appeal to the audience and even though he's a disagreeable character, I think many managed to find something all right about him - Owen's human sense in Larry.Jude Law is simply very very good; neither astounding nor bad. The only reason he does not stand out is the fact that we've all expected him to do a good performance. And he does, he has a great performance. He and Portman have amazing scenes together, and he's always on par.Simply put, the movie is not for everyone (especially not for seeing with a parent or young child); it's a mature adult flick, and does not back down from anything. It's high drama - with all the uplifting romance and brutal arguments of relationships. It's a story about people.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
I Stayed To The End,"What a treat. Most of the people who came with me, left, half way through the film. I stayed to the end and I loved it. It moved me. A rarity this days. The face of Jude Law is, still, so full of possibilities. He seems unafraid of darkness. Strong. This is his most grown up performance. I can't wait to see what he'll become. (If he stays away from Hollywood as much as temptations permit, and keeps that purity, that makes his darkness so powerful, as intact as humanly possible). Julia Roberts is wonderful in a performance part Margaret Sullavan, part Jeanne Moreau but all her own. Clive Owen is a force of nature. Dangerous, compelling, human to the hilt. And what about Natalie Portman? Wow. No surprise here. But what a surprise. I'm sure she is going to amaze us for years and years to come. I'm really glad I stayed to the end.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
He who laughs last,"The chronicle of an overlapping pair of relationships done up in raw 21st century life-is-pointlessism.Loved it until the final scenes, when it all stopped being in any sense of the word believable, and even resorted to done before cheap gimmickry? The rest however is rather good, and the acting by all four principle characters is to a person, first rate. Another problem I have is, I don't associate Natalie Portman with the 'rare uncultivated beauty' we're supposed to believe she is, quite the opposite actually. While I realize that is purely a matter of taste, I am sure I am not alone in believing her part was terribly miscast. The dialog is provocative, and definitely cuts to the quick on a lot of issues, but more importantly keeps you watching. But I wouldn't go overboard with the praise heaping on this film, because in the end its main tool is shock through brutality, crassness and vulgar lower the bar even more pillow talk. It is startlingly intelligent and even fresh, yet I don't care how its dressed up, or who the director is, the film is not dark as everybody labels it, but base. I don't know of any enduring literature or art that is patently vulgar, think about it.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Closer to reality...,"This is the most honest film I've ever seen. Although I'm sure there are critics out there who will comment on the explicit language rather than the story, anyone who's ever been in a dysfunctional relationship can relate to at least some part of this film. I for one found it a very personal and shockingly accurate depiction of how human beings use love and sex to unintentionally destroy each other. The performances were magnificent from all angles. Mike Nichols has done it again. This film is ""Carnal Knowledge"" for the new millennium. If the Academy does not recognize ""Closer"" as a Best Picture candidate, then the Academy should no longer be recognized as the authority on achievement in film... yes, it's that good.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Good acting, good script, but poor pacing and sluggish direction spoil it","I like some romantic comedies like the Holiday and Love Actually, but I was disappointed in Closer. It wasn't terrible, but it was very disappointing. It does benefit from a very good acting ensemble. Julia Roberts, Natalie Portman, Jude Law and Clive Owen all give very creditable performances, Owen the standout of the four. They are helped by an above average script, that is surprisingly intelligent. The cinematography is beautiful, fluid and sensitive.However, there were a number of things that made Closer disappointing for me. The biggest problem was the pace; the film is at approximation just under two hours, however the film takes a long time to get going, and the pace is very uneven, sadly it never recovers. The direction from Mike Nicolls is very sluggish, and lacked credibility. I will admit I liked the premise of Closer, but when I got round to seeing the film, its structure is disappointingly episodic and even underdeveloped. My next complaint is more of a semi-complaint. I really liked the overall music, but I disliked the song at the beginning. I think that was mainly to do with the singing voice of the vocalist, I found it very flat for my musical ears.All in all, Closer isn't a bad movie. Unfortunately, despite the fine acting ensemble, there were a number of things that didn't work for me. 6/10 Bethany Cox",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Farther,"I couldn't wait to see this movie. Now, I realize I should have waited to see this movie until it could be rented.This is a very cold film about some very unpleasant people who don't seem to be able to make up their minds about much. I liked the way it was done, I loved the acting, and I loved the use of ""Cosi Fan Tutte"" throughout the film.Yet it left me feeling empty. I never saw the play, but I imagine it was quite powerful. As a film, it had a deadly detachment.Certainly when one looks at a film like Virginia Woolf, also based on a play, also directed by Mike Nichols, also about some unpleasant people, one wonders why Woolf came off so well and this one didn't (for me, anyway). I think it's because Virginia Woolf is an incredible love story - at the end, when George explains that they're childless, and Martha says ""We couldn't"" referring to having a baby, one realizes what's underneath all of the unpleasantness.In ""Closer,"" there's just no payoff. Four people change partners, hurt one another, are seemingly incapable of doing anything else, but no one tells us why. Only the Natalie Portman character shows some humanity. But some isn't enough.Mike Nichols is a fabulous director, but the direction wasn't the problem here. It's the characterizations. I can't agree with some of the other posters that the film was fascinating. I didn't find it so. The theater was packed because of good reviews. I suppose the critics are hungry for something intelligent, and obviously the ticket-buying audience is, and who can blame them?But don't tell me this is the best you can come up with. When everybody walks out of the theater complaining, as they did after the showing I attended, there's a problem.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance
4-Braided,"I prefer when a movie is a movie. But when a movie is a very good play, we should be happy as well because there just aren't that many good things around.This is a play, there's no mistaking. All the dynamics in it are seated in the words, all the motives in the four beings. There is no cinematic device used or necessary, except the revealing of the passport at the end, and I am sure that was handled differently in the stage version.Mike Nichols makes a living out of taking constructions that work well on the stage and adding a few cinematic glosses so that the thing gives the impression it was born as a screen being. I find his tricks in this regard distracting, even a bit offensive because he hasn't adapted as the visual vocabulary has.Never mind. Just eliminate the film components of its being and focus on the stage components and you still have something worthwhile, because here Nichols is still fresh.You can read other folks to learn the story. It hardly matters. What matters to me is the clever, deep way the writer has constructed the thing. The visceral effect is from the panic and desperation of love. Nothing new there. What makes this effective, I think, are two things. Writerly things.The first is that he hasn't just described the tippy balance of living in a romance. He hasn't just displayed the radical fuzziness and unpredictability of a world where that is all you know. He's made it the root of the story. This story has absolutely none of the logic to it that you expect when you see a love story. Everything seems real and natural after it has happened, but there's no way at all to predict what will happen next when you are in the thing. Its a great help in storytelling; you have to cling fast to what is happening. Its the best type of engagement, sucking you in by simply making you wonder, even worry about what is going to happen next. Its rare. Its good.I'd like to point out how the four characters are constructed. A popular writing technique is to take one whole soul and break it into bits. Then the bits can get fleshed out imperfectly and interact so that the interaction has a being. In this case, start with a movie. What four pieces do you need? The writer (Dan), the photographer (Anna), the actor (Alice) and the director, the person concerned with the ""skin"" of the thing.Its no accident, I think that it is impossible to settle on any one of these characters. You can go through this experience time and time again, each time tracing a different person's path, or the path of a relationship or even an urge.This part is great too. Apart from Nichols' cinematic naivety, there's only one blot: Julia Roberts. She just doesn't understand what it means to be part of an assembly. She's not an actress in the real sense, the theatrical sense that Nichols knows how to sculpt. No wonder he wanted Cate Blanchett instead.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.",,Anonymous,Romance
Four people become entangled.,"Synopsis: Dan (Jude Law) meets Alice (Natalie Portman) after she is hit by a cab. She's just moved to London from NYC. He takes her to the hospital, where they chat and become friends. He writes obituaries; she's a stripper.A year later, Dan and Alice are living together. He's finished a novel and falls for the photographer that takes the picture for his book jacket, Anna (Julia Roberts). He introduces Anna to Larry (Clive Owen) and the four people become sexually entangled over the next few years.Review: Closer is a respectable effort. The film had a lot of potential, but failed in so many ways. Closer can be seen as the anti-date movie. It's hard to like the characters, and even harder to like their actions. Even so, it paints a picture so close to reality.A controversy revolving Closer was the sexual content. While sex never occurs on screen, it's a prominent topic and is actually the plot (if there is one) to the film. The only nudity is seen at the strip club, but the dialogue is almost repulsive. Most is not needed, or could have been better if it was only implied. A scene in the strip club with Alice and Larry is probably the height of the vulgarness.Julia Roberts and Jude Law turn in good performances, but are easily out acted by Natalie Portman, who proves to be an adult, and Clive Owen, who shows incredible emotion with his sleazy character.Closer is the perfect example of love at first sight. The tag line for the film states: ""If you believe in love at first sight, you never stop looking."" That's essentially the core of the movie. Were these people truly in love? If they were, why would they be so unfaithful to their ""true love""? Is appearance and first impressions an important factor in determining who we're going to spend our life with?Each character in Closer has their share of lies. Lying to their current lover, lying to themselves. It effectively shows that men will do anything to get what they want, and how quickly the women will fall for it. I'm not saying that the female characters are any less guilty in immorality or whatever you'd call it, but they seemed to be the more naive of the four.Closer contains a great deal of good, but in all, it doesn't add up to a complete motion picture. The sexual content could have been reduced, thus unneeded in many instances. A very depressing film, but thought provoking nevertheless. Good performances abound, but do not make up for holes that could have easily turned this average film into a more compelling motion picture. Viewer discretion advised: Closer is not for everyone.C (6/10)",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
DANGEROUSLY CLOSE TO PERFECTION!,"It's once in a very rare time that I go to the movies and I'm treated as an adult. I see a film that is intelligent, thought provoking, provocative and rawly realistic. Closer is that film. It present an honest portrayal of four severely unlikable characters and they screw with each others love lives back and forth. The film is told in adult sporting complexity through the growing plot points , the way it's filled and it's tasty advancing dialogue. Everyone in the film turns in a powerhouse performance worthy of Oscar consideration. Ms. Portman is wonderful as Alice shedding her blockbuster star wars acting skills and portraying someone multi dimensional with heart and pizazz. Julia Roberts stars as Anna in a cold, subtle performance which will leave audiences appreciating her acting believability as she pounces through each of her scenes with charismatic force. Jude law and Clive Owen are the real surprises here both turning in wonderfully appealing performance. Strong, weak, flawed and memorable. Especially whose last outing was the entertaining but mediocre action summer pic King Arthur. The film has wonderfully tight direction and sports beautifully placid colors and a fine adult score. The film draws dangerously close to being a near perfect film. I only wish it could've gone on for abit longer I wasn't completely satisfied to the ends of the characters on which we were give. but life itself isn't perfect or satisfying and this is a slick of someones life.

Flawed but ultimately worthwhile,"People aren't having fun. The world isn't nice and reality is cruel. The deep core of relationships consists in the end of pure self-humiliation. The human heart looks like ""a fist covered in blood"" and we should ""try lying for a change, it's the currency of the world"". This is ""Closer"". Four people that go around in circles through each other, exploring the art of heartbreaking. By the credits, all of them has been (and cheated) with each other. In the beginning, nobody is particularly happy. In the end, nobody is particularly happy.This has been seen before, but seldom in Hollywood. It is very understandable that there has been a hype surrounding this film, given that it is an American film and not, specially not, European. The raw and totally unforgiving tone is daring indeed. Mike Nichols, on the other hand, has always been dancing around the thin line of what is sentimentally ""under-the-top"" and his very raw directing is of course a given trade of success for ""Closer"". The precision of the work in this film is, at moments, pure brilliant. The Production Design is always reflecting the hollow and artificial, the music is symbolic to the very last (wether The Smiths ""How Soon is Now?"" or Mozart's ""Cosí fan tutte"", translated ""So do they all"") and while the audience never gets to witness any real love sequences, the characters are constantly finding aways of avoiding emotions when faced with them. It is very well-made and the collaboration between the elements are giving a solid rock foundation for the film which makes it deliver it's punches.There are problems, though. In an absurd way, while the themes are heavy, there is something very ""easy"" about the film. If there ever was a ""feel-good""-movie playing with the audience instinctive emotions, ""Closer"" is quite the ""feel-bad""-film, doing just the same. And while ""Closer"" has a realistic portrayal of the real life, the film also feels somewhat unrealistic at points. The screenplay is filled with smart and overly coherent dialog, but it doesn't give anything else. In all the wit of the dialog, the coherence vanishes. The characters, specially Julia Roberts', tend to come off blank and fuzzy, going from one point to the other constantly and without any reason. Nichols' directing makes ""Closer"" look the real world, but the screenplay shows us things that, without being exaggerated, still come off like something that simply doesn't happen.Still, ""Closer"" is a refreshing American film. It's too shallow and unambiguously written to be any near a masterpiece, but the good craftsmanship makes it a worthwhile and recommended tragedy.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
What a strange movie...,"How do I describe this? The movie features terrific performances by Jude Law, Clive Owen, and Natalie Portman, and not much of a performance by Julia Roberts, who seems to have mailed in her performance.It's all above love at first sight not being enough. Law's character, who should be the winner, ends up the loser. His entire world is a lie, as he discovers at the end of the movie. He's a terribly dislikeable fellow, and so is Clive Owen's character.Roberts seems to have sleep-walked through this movie, which I really don't get.

"As said before, Natalie and Clive are spectacular","As Clive Owen's Larry often comments, ""how could he leave you?"" The idea of Jude Law's Dan leaving the sexy, exuberant and very snarky Alice for the plain-Jane Anna is a hard concept to wrap your mind around. You simply must believe in the concept of two souls so unbelievably drawn to each other that nothing else matters.I feel as though I am giving Julia Roberts the short end of the stick, she acts the part with moderate success, only shining on the rare occasion that her dialog exceeds anyone else's. The movie is a tale of deception and love and complicated a complicated love...square?Where this film exceeds more spectacularly is not only in Owen and Portman's brilliance, but in the outside character development. In many movies with similar story lines the two characters who instigate the affairs have significant others that are either a) unsatisfying and dull, b) too nice for their own good or, c) one who is not up to par with their partners. In this case, none of the above apply. Alice shimmers and turns heads everywhere she goes and despite her love Dan still finds it fit to cheat on her relentlessly. How he goes from attempting to convince Anna to see him to being loving boyfriend in a split second is quite amazing.I am not the first to say that the two nominated for Academy Awards in this picture are truly the greatest, there was no oversight whatsoever for the other two leads. Jude Law does have chemistry with Alice that makes their relationship all the more believable, but you cannot help but wonder...why in God's name would he leave her?",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Flawlessly From Stage to Screen,"The strength of Closer, both as a play and a motion picture, is the flawless, mature and beautifully crafted dialogue. Patrick Marber's screenplay is a testament to his truly great writing ability, as not much of the original text needed to be adapted in order to work appropriately and effectively on screen.The raw emotion and base convictions of these four tragic characters (all acted exquisitly) is given to us primarily through their words and those words are all we need.If you need more than words and are looking for a feel good love story, steer clear, you will only be disappointed.However, if you are looking for a piece that will intrigue your senses, causing you to examine your own soul, your own convictions, then I highly recommend Closer.Like Shakespeare, Williams, and O'Neil, whose words are a testament to the condition of their lives and times, Marber, through his language and presentation of these four exquisite lost souls, forces the mind to acknowledge and deal with the most base of our natural tendencies, painting a brutally honest portriat of the human condition in the 21st century.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Fine as an acting exercise, though it bears little connection to reality","Patrick Marber adapted his own play about two not-so-loving couples in London who briefly exchange partners after romance sours at home: Julia Roberts is a photographer who marries dermatologist Clive Owen while flirting heavily with failed novelist Jude Law, who in turn is married to stripper/waitress Natalie Portman. Not even a superb director like Mike Nichols can get us over the implacable, impossible meet-cutes of the principals, nearly stalling the movie at the starting gate. However, the cast is smartly-attuned to their roles (if not wholly convincing), and the interwoven complications of these needling, guilty people are smoothly presented in an unobtrusively artistic manner (we are occasionally taken back and forth in time, yet Nichols steers the audience through the narrative like a master craftsman, without a hint of hesitancy). The dialogue is made up of unblinking and unblushing adult conversation, yet these immature characters (intentionally) do not behave like adults. They are helplessly selfish, rude and fickle, which sometimes shades the proceedings with a darkly comic grandeur that is unexpected and rewarding. **1/2 from ****",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Far, Far Away: America Loves Delusion","I won't reveal what ultimately happens in Closer but I will confess that I was disappointed that it didn't end with a fiery double-decker bus crash that left no survivors. This film would have been stale 20 years ago, but it's completely ridiculous now. The ""truths"" about relationships that the movie attempts to reveal are just nuggets of stereotypical nonsense that you could see in a TV movie(Men thrive on conquest and dominance, Women can't resist being treated like whores, etc.). The film, like it's characters is shallow and dishonest underneath the pretty exterior.Of the four main actors, Natalie Portman fairs the best. I didn't buy her character, but I didn't want to beat her with a lead pipe either. The other actors aren't so lucky. Clive Owen is in total stage actor mode. I have long suspected that Julia Roberts is actually computer generated or a state of the art robot and this film offers more compelling evidence in support of my theory. Jude Law is a total non-presence here which is a shame because he shows hints of charisma in other films.I am absolutely dumbfounded by claims that this movie is in any way truthful, real or gritty. It's incredibly stagey and the dialog in no way resembles the way people talk when they're not performing on stage. I thought Neil Labute's The shape of Things was a low water mark that no film adaptation of a play could surpass in awfulness. Not the case. I am intrigued yet horrified that this film seems to resonate with a large chunk of viewers. The characters are total constructs: the Arbus rip-off photographer, the duplicitous writer, the educated yet primitive doctor, the wise stripper.Maybe the film is realistic in the same way that Iraq was full of WMDs and privatization will solve the country's social security ""problem"".

Hollywood is getting real,"What an amazing concept. A story that perfectly captures the emotions that we feel when involved in a love spat. The complete desire and need for another person, wanting to hold them close to you, while at the same point in time the mere vision of seeing that person and hearing their voice sends you into utter misery and you feel repulsed by them. Jude Law is masterful in his role, and he is matched equally by the performances of Clive Owen, Natalie Portman and Julia Roberts. A brilliant movie with many mixed emotions. As soon as you think, okay, this is where they live happily ever after, another twisting tale occurs. This is as real as it gets folks.

Engaging and entertaining.,"Closer is the story of two couples whose lives end up entangled through a series of confrontations and chance meetings ripe with lies, regret and pain. It is consistently engaging, sometimes pretty funny and the characters are generally easy to relate to. Although there are some fairly prominent themes present including the uglier sides of human nature and dysfunctional relationships, I felt that it wasn't a particularly deep film.I thought the performances were quite good (especially Natalie Portman) but I often felt something was missing from the characters. Although I appreciated the way the film focused on their nastier sides in an uncompromising kind of way, perhaps the characters could have used some more development as responsible adults to contrast against their arguably childish behaviour. Maybe the characters were intended to be as shallow and insecure as they came across but I think without some fundamental redeeming qualities they become less interesting. For example, many of the verbal jabs thrown around seemingly only to cause pain came across as unrealistic for the most part.To the movie's credit, despite these weaknesses, I always found the characters interesting and the scenes engaging. It just meant I didn't feel Closer was very effective in expressing some kind of deeper meaning. Actually, while watching the movie, I got the impression that it was primarily intended to entertain and just hint a little at some more substantial ideas without actually having the commitment to pursue them.In this way, Closer works just fine. Some parts are funny, some parts are a bit disturbing or even touching in various ways and most of it is enjoyable to watch. So I thought it was good, quite good, just not great though I don't think it was meant to be.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Should have been titled Eyes Wide Open,"Imagine your partner has cheated on you and you get the chance to confront them and have them openly answer all the questions that just rip your heart out of your chest. Not the standard questions that we all see on television dramas, but the questions that will induce deep emotional wounds.'Was he better than me?''Did you have sex in our house?''Did he make love to you differently?'These are questions that should remain in an impermeable vault. No response will be satisfying to the inquirer. But these are exactly some of the questions that are thrown at the audience when two of the four major characters in Mike Nichols new film Closer admit to their infidelity.The film focuses on four individuals, Alice (Natalie Portman) who meets Dan (Jude Law) after being hit by car on a London street; Anna (Julia Roberts), a divorced photographer who ends up meeting Larry (Clive Owen) in a way that is far too interesting to reveal here.In fact, this movie is so character and story driven that it benefits the viewer from watching it play out rather than spelled out, so I don't intend on offering many plot points as part of this review.What I can say is that this is a good film that gets great performances from all its leads. Clive Owen in particular gives us a suave dermatologist with fits of rage that border on the violent. His performance is mesmerizing and his presence is commanding in along any of the other three more commonly known stars. When he confronts Anna after coming home from a business trip, he is enraged, hurt, inquisitive and broken hearted. Being able to convey a cavalcade of thoughts and emotions in such a powerful scene reminds us of the promise he conveyed in his first mainstream film, Croupier back in 1998.And while Larry works out what is to be his new life of bachelor ship, Alice equally confronts her betrayer with raw emotion and a lack of understanding.Natalie Portman, like Owen is on the brink of stardom that should have both their trophy cases full of statues before their careers are over. Asked to hold her own amongst strong actors twenty years her senior, Portman matures in her role as Alice and becomes the pin-up 'girl to watch' for the next decade.Based on a screenplay by Patrick Marber (adapted from his own play), the movie plays out like a stage performance. There are primarily only four speaking parts and very few sets and location shots.The result is a very strong-dialogs film. Very strong. Those that see the trailers and expect to see Oscar contenders Roberts and Law have flightless banter, be warned. Director Mike Nichols incorporates explicit details about their sexual encounters with every foul word in George Carlins dictionary being paraded in rapid-fire progression.But hell, we're all adults here, and if you can get beyond the utter deception that almost every character tries to hide, yet reveal, yet hide (you'll have to see it to understand), you will find a real good movie that could have been titled Eyes Wide Open.So, I can't recommend this as a date film, but if you are in the mood for a movie about betrayal, love, obsession, sex, pain, lust, fear, loneliness, commitment, jealousy and honesty, this might just be the Christmas movie you are looking for.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
A searing drama that made me want to shower afterward,"Mike Nichols' film ""Closer"" is simply a study in human relationships. Other than the four main characters, everyone else is an extra, with minimal dialogue, if any. Jude Law is Dan, a struggling writer who is a member of the Obituary staff at a London paper. One day he catches the eye of Alice, (Natalie Portman) who is walking down the street toward him, newly arrived from the United States. They lock eyes (in the film it seems like minutes, but is probably seconds) before she steps into oncoming traffic and gets hit by a car. Her injuries are not serious, but they are the beginning of a long and painful relationship. Some time later, Anna (Julia Roberts) a photographer, is snapping a photo of Dan for his upcoming debut novel when he promptly hits on her. The attraction is obviously mutual, but she manages to hold him off since he is involved with Alice, and she is newly separated from her husband. Some time later, he is messing around on the Internet, pretending to be a woman and chatting with a completely clueless doctor, Larry (Clive Owen). Dan arranges to meet Larry at the aquarium and tells him his name is ""Anna"". Of course, Anna is sitting there, Larry thinks she is the one he talked to, she is clueless, but figures out that Dan played a joke on both of them. Soon, THEY begin a relationship. Throughout the next year or two (the passing of time is so off-handedly managed that it is hard to determine exactly what time frame we pass) relationships get blurred, soured and, I hate to create a pun here: closer.The tagline for ""Closer"" is ""If you believe in love at first sight, you never stop looking"". According to the action in the film, truer words were never spoken. The moral of the story is that everyone cheats. And if they don't, they are excessively co-dependent. (And actually, there are some cheaters who are excessively co-dependent.) While the story was very intricately woven, impressively so, it was still hard to take, particularly during a scene in which Clive Owen confronts Julia Roberts about her infidelity. The pain that these people cause one another is so pervasive that it becomes almost a character itself. And while the sleaze factor was so high I wanted to shower with a particularly abrasive soap the second I got home, the film's story was actually extremely thought provoking and discussion-worthy. Just driving home, my boyfriend and I got into a discussion about the characters, and he said that Anna was the most despicable character Julia Roberts has played, while I thought that Clive Owen was a bit much. I think the film acts as both a solidifier and divider between men and women on a few different levels, a sign that the film obviously succeeds in proving its thesis.The acting in ""Closer"" is first-rate. I have never seen any of the characters in better form, quite honestly. Portman, an actress that I have marginalized as mediocre since every performance after her stunning debut in ""The Professional"", also impressed me; she subtly exhibited both weakness and slyness in a manner that made her character purposely hard to read. I actually consider Jude Law's performance as Dan to be his best since his role in ""Road to Perdition"". (Certainly a feat considering he was featured in no less than 653 films in 2004.) Roberts was actually mesmerizing (she's come a long way since the insipid ""Pretty Woman"") and I look forward to seeing Owen have a well-deserved prolific film career. As for the direction, Mike Nichols is flawless. He has really become a master at his trade. This doesn't necessarily mean that he is ceaselessly compelling, though he made all the right decisions in ""Closer"" from the pacing to the soundtrack, particularly the Damien Rice track that plays a couple of times throughout the film, (though I would have liked to have heard the Suzanne Vega song that is featured in the trailer) I would not go out of my way to see a Mike Nichols film based on his name alone, but I put him higher on the cred ladder that Ron Howard is also on; the films are usually good, but they don't always completely enthrall me.This was not the case with ""Closer"" however. I walked out of the film not liking it at first, but I think that was because it was such a depressing commentary on relationships. The more I realized I was thinking about it even days after seeing it, the more I realized that it actually was a good movie with an unpleasant theme and some great acting. Whereas I would have given it a lower score right out of the box, I give it a supportive 7/10 now.--Shelly",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

This is not your typical romantic movie. So be warned!!This is however a very true, down to earth and gritty take on reality. Relationships in the new millennium if you will. But again don't expect any romanticism! And although this sounds (and indeed is) harsh, this is what makes this movie so wonderful. It hurts to love it ... and that is exactly what you should feel while watching it. So you might despise it because it hurt, while you watched it, but that was the overall intention!

"Closer - pointless, grating and unrelenting","There is much hype to be found surrounding Mike Nichol's 'Closer', celebrated for its frankness and ""Oscar-worthy"" performances. I despised this movie however. Not that it is particularly badly written, acted or directed, but I found 'Closer' to be inane, inept, and totally unlikable with no apparent reason for existing other than to highlight the worst aspects of humanity. The movie is plodding and its cynicism about relationships and life in general is far too overblown. Infidelity and repeated sexual liaisons interchange between the same four characters for the entire length of the movie. Are we supposed to care about these people or their relationships? Are we supposed to care how cruelly they treat each other? It certainly doesn't appear that way, the film seems to want us to be distant from these characters, but for what reason? It's utterly pointless, banal, and the characters are just shallow, especially Clive Owen's Larry, whom I found to be completely repulsive. I am comfortable with explorations of sex in film, but here it is just tiresome; ""controversial"" and ""sexually honest"" material is substituted for any real, or at least interesting, character development. If this had been successfully achieved, we could connect with these people on some level, any level. Does the film wish us to applaud its excessive use of sexual expletives as bold; daring? It is frank, provocative, and often interestingly in-you-face honest, but as the film drags this approach just becomes grating and unrelenting. Add to this, the movie jumps ahead months and years at a time, which furthers our detachment from ever fully accessing these characters, ever fully understanding these characters, as if we are only offered the worst moments of the last four years of their lives - this continual distancing is distressing. This movie just rubbed me the wrong way.I think there is enjoyment to be had from 'Closer', with some memorable performances, but that is about all this film has to offer. Many people may find this movie endearing, but unfortunately this movie failed to grab me. 'Closer' is sometimes effectively emotional in its exploration of diminishing trust and love in modern relationships and Natalie Portman is remarkable. She is undoubtedly the standout of this film, bringing a much-needed, though never fully realised innocence to the film (although her talents are wasted on this trite film), and Clive Owen successfully inhabits the persona of sex-craved man, seemingly without redemption. Julia Roberts as Anna and Jude Law as Dan are impressive, though less impacting than the others. Patrick Marber's screenplay has some high points and the dialogue mostly works, but as we, completely drawn back, continue to watch these characters dig themselves deeper into their own sh*t, the film ultimately becomes a mega- disappointment. As a harsh social commentary it does its job, but there really, truly is no point to 'Closer' other than that life is crap, relationships are crap, people are crap and these people end up with other crappy people.",4.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Lose the ""C"" in the title ... ""LOSER""","They really should lose the ""C"" in the title and re-title it ""LOSER"" ! This is one putrid story about four people who absolutely deserve each other. The viewer grows to loathe and even despise EVERY one of these despicable human beings. I don't care how good the acting is, the story and the characterization is just awful. Save your money at all cost. For a movie that was so over hyped, I'm glad that it was surprisingly a commercial flop. It's gotten to the point where large critics make me sick. They praise inferior stoiries because they either admire the actors or receive kickbacks. Ebert & Roeper got me out to see this movie. I should have known better.

Magnificent Romance for Adults,"In London, the American new arrival and former striper Alice Ayres (Natalie Portman) meets the mediocre obituary journalist Daniel (Jude Law) and they move together. Dan writes a book, inspired in the life of Alice, and while photographing for the release of the book, he meets the American photographer Anna (Julia Roberts). Dan ""introduces"" the dermatologist Larry (Clive Owen) to Anna, and they get married. However, Dan and Anna have a passionate affair, complicating the relationship of the couples.""Closer"" is a magnificent romance, but recommended for adults. The dramatic story is an intriguing tale of relationship, with love, passion, betrayal, forgiveness, insecureness, infidelity, elements that shall be handled very carefully by the director and screenplay writer; otherwise it might have become a boring or corny soap-opera. In this regard, the screenplay of Patrick Marber, and the direction of Mike Nichols, using ellipsis and flashbacks to present the events, sometimes years or months later, is spectacular, working perfectly in the film. This is the first time that Clive Owen proves (at least for me) that he is a good actor, with an awesome performance. Natalie Portman is also fantastic and they really deserved the nominations they received in many awards, including the Oscar. Natalie Portman is also very beautiful and shows an astonishing body. Julie Robert, still a very pretty woman, and Jude Law, complete the outstanding cast of this great movie. I liked a lot the surprising revelation disclosed in the end of the story.

"Great characters study, that oddly never pays off.","The movie starts and ends with last year's breakout ballad. It has a grand intensity. The drama and humor, are paced symbiotically. And more importantly, the acting is outstanding. The four actors portrayed their characters so flawlessly, it is unbelievable. It was as if those were written especially for them. Also, various scenes are so greatly written and directed, you'd expect nothing more but a wonderful ending. Unfortunately for us, and maybe the people involved in the making of it. After the movie slowly unraveled, the ending is its biggest disappointment. The way characters were given closure, was dull and oddly predictable. Personally, I hated how some leads were thrown under a bus, or simply torn apart, to fit a certain idea of screenwriting's logic. But you still get some satisfying answers, and roles are sort of reversed, when the antagonists are those the script redeemed the most.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

Realistic + ugly look at love in the 21st century,"Alice (Portman) and Dan (Law) are in love. Dan meets photographer, Anna (Roberts) and becomes infatuated with her. Dan and Larry (Owen) meet while having online sex (unbeknownst to Larry is Dan's gender). Larry meets Anna when Dan cruelly orchestrates a rendezvous. Anna and Larry fall in love. Anna and Dan fall in love. They all break each other's hearts.'Closer' is a relationship merry-go-round, in which the four main characters; Anna, Alice, Dan and Larry all fall in love with one another; and while falling out of love with each other, partake in ugly, vicious verbal abuse and then pathetically go crawling back into each other's arms for another spin on loves carnival ride. 'Closer' is a realistic look at love in the 21st century. Forget the chocolates and roses; this film only ever offers the warts. Following two couples as they begin their relationships, but focusing more on the ways they destroy them. Everything about 'Closer' is confronting, uncomfortable and truthful and it's probably all that truth which makes the film so ugly.There was a lot of hype surrounding the four actors of the film; praise was heaped but I simply don't see where all the fuss came from. Her golden globe aside, Natalie Portman's portrayal of a lovable yet needy stripper is pretty lackluster; which makes her character of Alice stick out like a sore thumb, because she's not nearly as aggravating and repellent as the other 3 characters. Somehow I just think that if she'd been a little harder, nastier it would have rounded out her character a little better. Equally uninteresting are Jude Law and Julia Roberts. For the life of me I cannot see what is so sexy and appealing about Mr. Law. He is plain, skinny and big-headed (not as in arrogant, I literally mean the man has a head too big for his skinny body!) His character of Dan does absolutely nothing to ease my dislike for him as an actor. Law plays him as a man who believes himself to be an utter romantic, when in reality (and as the audience can see), Dan is merely a creepy guy addicted to the newness and innocence of love. Law is utterly unimpressive and quite frankly, boring. He brings nothing of his own to the character. The same can be said of Julia Roberts; while I do commend her for taking on such an uncharacteristic role, her performance was simply dull. But I did find it amusing that even when she played a hooker in ""Pretty Woman"", she was never nearly as slutty as she is in 'Closer'. However; amidst the uninteresting and ordinary, there was one who mesmerized. Clive Owen. Not only is he utterly gorgeous - even when heaping ugly verbal abuse, particularly repeating certain four letter words which made even the teenaged me cringe; Owen is in a class all his own. Perhaps it's the fact that he played the role of Dan in Patrick Marber's original stage play. Perhaps it's the fact that Portman, Law and Roberts were so unimpressive, that anybody even a notch better, absolutely shines. Or maybe (and this is the possibility I like best) Owen really is just super talented, and one relatively new British actor Hollywood should sure be on the look-out for. Playing Larry as a very bi-polar lover; believing himself to be victim of love one minute and then suddenly turning nasty and barbaric the next; Owen's performance as scornful lover and smooth operator is the most realistic and confronting of all. All of the characters have one thing in common though; they are all weak. Despite the mess of their relationships, the ugliness in their past; these characters still go back to one another, instead of cutting loose and giving themselves a clean slate. This, for the viewer, is not only annoying but like a car crash, impossible to look away from.For all of the film's emotional and verbal abuse; I liked the fact that director Mike Nicholas and play write Patrick Marber never included any loves scenes or physical aggression. The film is very much sexually charged; it has to be, with all the swapping and exchanging of partners. There are moments in which the sexual implications are a little uncomfortable to watch - most notably is the online conversation between Larry and Dan; just when you think their language cant get any filthier. Oh wait!... It does! But otherwise the film does well to portray just how much more wounding and debilitating people's words and actions can be. We never see the affairs taking place; what we see is the aftereffects, the ripples these people's mistakes and selfishness have on those around them. And that is far more human and tragic.A very interesting film, delving deep into the darkness of relationships exploring topics which are often so uncomfortable to watch being played out, that you'll be wriggling in your seat. Despite being held up by a mostly dull cast (Owen being the exception), the film's issues are enough to keep you interested, if not a little appalled.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Oh What Wretched Characters,"Unnecessarily tangled romantic relationships among four beautiful people in modern London form the core of this Mike Nichols directed film, based on a play. About the only thing I liked here was the melancholy song ""The Blower's Daughter"", sung by Damien Rice, that opens the film. The film's script is wretched.Selfish, self-absorbed, obsessed with sex, vindictive, and shallow are how I would describe the four main characters, people who are annoyingly photogenic and ""hip"". The dialogue is like an interrogation session, with characters asking prying, intimate questions, over and over. These characters don't talk like real people. They emote, as if their words came straight from a screenplay, which makes the story seem ... fake. The dialogue is so contrived, so expedient to the plot, that I couldn't take any of these vain people, or their drama, seriously.The film's action trends static. Characterization and dialogue are what count here, the back and forth banter that describes these miserable people.Casting is terrible. I would have had more respect for this film if the four beautiful people had been played by less well-known actors. All four of the A-list actors here ... pose. They convey the impression that the film is about their performances, their careers.Visuals are acceptable, if unremarkable. The highbrow, artsy music is fine, except that it amplifies an overall sense of pretentiousness.With such unlikeable characters and with dialogue that is super, super contrived, this film left me bored and eager for it to end. Mike Nichols used to be a really fine director. ""Closer"" is not one of his better films.",2.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Well acted but too extreme, convenient and lacking the development that would have made the characters people I care about","After a chance meeting at the scene of an accident, Alice and Dan start seeing each other and fall in love. When Dan has his photograph taken for his new book, he meets Anna and kisses her  starting a desire for her that continues even when a practical joke sees her happening to meet Larry. Anna and Larry fall for one another and start seeing each other while Dan and Alice continue their relationship. However desires, the truth and complexities in modern relationships all see things falling apart as easily as they first came together.Perhaps it says something about the majority of films released in the cinema these days but, whenever we get one that is dark, adult and edgy it is almost a given that the critics will fall over themselves to praise it and many viewers drawn to it will go ready to appreciate it no matter what. So it seems with Closer: an adult, bleak, dark look at the selfish and fleeting nature of ""love"" that is deeply flawed despite being still worth a watch. I heard one critic say that he disliked this film because he just wanted to get up on the screen and slap all the characters for being stupid  I don't totally agree with him but the problem that made him say that (I think) is pretty much the same problem that I have with it. That is the narrative and the lack of development. You see, the film jumps years at a time without ever telling you it has  and it jumps from one ""complex situation"" to another with nothing in between. Therefore, although much of it is well written and convincing, it is never happening to real people or even characters we know or care about it  it feels like you're standing in the street watching a couple fight, you have no involvement but it is of some interest.Like I said, a lot of it is convincing; yes these people are stupid in love, driven by desires and unlikely to ever be happy but then that is what a lot of people are like to a lesser extent. The exaggeration and the lack of inner development within the story combines to damage this and it does regularly lose this convincing touch because it goes too far or does things in a lazy fashion (the heavy reliance on coincidence early on is an insult to the audience). For example the final twist in the film is very interesting but yet we are given nothing to help us understand the character it involves or even care about it retrospectively. It is a real shame because the cast try so hard and are so good that it is hard not to like their performances. Roberts is very low key and, perhaps deliberately, underplays a lot compared to the others. Owen is the standout  playing a nice guy on the surface but much more just under the surface; it is difficult to ""get"" a simple character sometimes but here he does this complex one justice. Like me, Law may not have totally understood his character and didn't cope as well with the complexities within him but still does well with the role. Portman is difficult for me to judge because I do have a lot of time for her and it is hard to be objective. I didn't feel that her character was well done at all but that she as an actress had done the best she could with it regardless.Overall this is a dark, edgy and adult film and it does make a change from the constant action movies and teenage thrillers in the multiplexes but these factors alone do not make it a fantastic film, even if it does make it an interesting film (it is certainly not a ""triumph"" as the poster proclaims). The narrative only concerns crisis-points, sometimes years apart, without putting anything in between and it exaggerates things to the point where it is hard to really let them touch you even if a lot of it is pretty convincing and realistic (at least in the heart if not actions)  this leaves us without characters we care about and just performances to watch. The cast are roundly great but it is hard to really care about it enough. I didn't want to get up and slap the characters but the film was a bit like watching a couple fight  interesting, realistic but neither requiring nor allowing any emotional involvement from the viewers.",,Anonymous,Romance

"Sleek, Fun, High-Minded Sex-Head Games","I very much enjoyed this movie and want to recommend it to viewers seeking a quality film.Having said that, I don't so much recommend it for how it is marketing itself -- as a deep, risk-taking movie that has the courage to speak edgey truths about men, women, sex, and love.Rather, I want to recommend it as a sleek, witty, well-made movie that puts four of the most supernaturally beautiful people alive today: Clive Owen, Jude Law, Julia Roberts and Natalie Portman, up on screen in one sexually provocative situation after another.Yum.The movie is intellectually and aesthetically above almost everything else in mainstream cinemas as I write this, winter 2004.It's tighter, better constructed, and more economical than the narrative mess of the Howard Hughes biopic ""Aviator."" It's funnier than ""Meet the Fockers."" After all, the director is Mike Nichols, who gave us ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?""There are all sorts of gestures that an earnest English Major plunging, for the first time, into the mysteries of symbolism will pounce upon: one of the characters is a stripper who refuses to reveal herself even while stripping; one of the characters is a dermatologist -- a literal skin doctor -- a key scene of flirtation and seduction takes place -- oh, come on now -- in front of a tank full of man-eating sharks.Add another main character who is a photographer who has dedicated herself to photographing strangers and a writer who ""steals"" the lifestory of his lover and you've got a full night of discussion over coffee and cigarettes.In scene after scene, the outside world disappears -- this movie could have taken place almost anywhere, at anytime, it is so divorced from the surrounding world, and so focused on the bedroom problems of its main characters -- and the four beautiful protagonists are tormented by love, by yearning, by their partner's infidelity, by the physical attractiveness of people they cannot have, or should not have, by jealousy, by their partner's game playing -- really, it's an Olympic Decathalon of ""things that can go wrong when in love and lust.""And the performances are first rate. Jude Law uses his beauty wonderfully to convey a man with more sensitivity than strength; Clive Owen uses his very different masculine beauty and intensity to portray a self-styled ""caveman"" with working class roots. Natalie Portman is terrific as a sensitive and yet savvy streetwise ""waif.""Is ""Closer"" as deep as it thinks it is? Or is it just about getting to see Jude Law kiss Julia Roberts kiss Clive Owen kiss Natalie Portman? In bathrobes, stripper costumes, thong underwear? Well, look at it this way: suppose Amanda Plummer, Rhea Perlman, Paul Giamatti, and Jason Alexander were the leads? With the same script? I don't think so.Really, I liked this movie. I liked seeing these beautiful people play very wittily written sex-head games with each other for a couple of hours.I didn't, though, think that this movie was the equal of ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf"" or ""Night of the Iguana"" or many another talky, character-focused movie that really did make me think twice about men, women, love, fidelity, sex, and yearning.I still think it is one of the most worth seeing movie out there right now.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

But still, not one of the four protagonists is likable, with the exception of maybe Natalie Portman's character Alice - but even then ... if I explained it'd be a major spoiler...They are all so selfish, self indulgent and totally lacking of caring for others feelings...

"the acting, writing, and direction are creative, skilled, cold as ice picks","Closer is a British-American relationship drama about people that really are not too likable, but that it is part of what might be a kind of working thesis for the film should be taken into account. The four principles- Julia Roberts, Jude Law, Natalie Portman, and Clive Owen- are like amalgamations of all of the lesser characteristics of those in post-modern relationship plays and films, where the love and goodness in them is subdued under their lack of connections to one another. That it all doesn't work as well as, for prime example, Nichol's own Carnal Knowledge, may be because of the script more than anything. What is successful from Marber's work- of showing four characters who find what they are looking for, then go into complete and utter disillusionment- it really has to walk a fine line of having these people talking truthfully, honestly not just in the context of their characters but how MOST people do talk in relationships. Sometimes its quite believable, and sometimes not, and when it's not the script lends itself more to the basis of 'hip' language, like Kevin Smith if he substituted pop-culture references for rough innuendo and hurt. It's a hit or miss script from a play that may or may not have been better for the stage where it's necessarily a dialog-driven medium. And because of the time lapses and twists and turns given to the characters over the course of however many years pass in the film, it's as much worth to do for the filmmakers as it is a possible liability.This all being said, Nichols does give all four characters the proper actors for what they're required for. Even the lesser two of the four (from my point of view), Roberts and Law, have little fascinating moments amid their shallow and flawed sides (and this is from someone who can hardly stand most Roberts movies). Owen, meanwhile, is so good and precise and with flair and directness that it does practically impede on the others to keep up with how much he's into his character's cold, reaching psychology. Portman is actually just as good though, and proves once again her stamina for dramatic scenes, and even for the steamier ones; the scene in the strip club between Owen and Portman is probably the best 'sexy' kind of scene the actors and Nichols have been involved with. As all four reach into a revelatory- and if you're looking into it almost obvious- conclusion, one has to admire the depths that are being plunged here, however lacking some of the more darker realities of the world. It's a story of affluent, ranging middle-class types who are far from stupid, but also have some harsh problems with one another when seeming to have what they want. It doesn't have the exemplary power and theatrical grace of a Bergman theatrical drama, but it is a nifty example on its own for those very familiar with the actors. One more thing, the opening and end credits song, for lack of a better word, comes close to killing the mood big time for me. 7.5/10",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Clive Owen owned this one.,"I got the pleasure of attending a screening tonight of the film and I might as well comment on it. Overall, I did enjoy the film. No, Natalie Portman doesn't get naked. The acting was great and I have never found Clive Owen so perfect. The lies and slime of the characters keep you watching with wide eyes. Sometimes the film tries a little too hard, ending up being overly dramatic. I don't think comedy was needed during heated arguments between the characters, but it definitely doesn't ruin the film. The most enjoyable thing is to see the characters set themselves up for downfall further down the road. Overall, this was a good film with great acting. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Closer? No thanks, I'll keep my distance","The only redeeming thing about this movie was its cast. I watched this with my two roommates and at the end we were all depressed and confused as to why four such excellent actors would ever sign up for this movie.When I say depressed, I mean DEPRESSED. This has to be one of the most depressing movies I've ever seen, not necessarily because of the subject matter (though that was depressing) but more because all four of the main characters were unlikeable and miserable the entire movie (Julia Roberts smiled maybe twice in the entire thing).The movie tried to establish a theme of Lying and Being Lied To, but in the end just ended up being entirely predictable and boring. By the end you didn't really care who was lying and who was being lied to, nor did you care what happened to the characters because they were all so completely unlikeable (immoral and bland are the two best words that come to mind). Bland is a perfect word for this movie. Every scene was filmed in a dull, colorless location, with the exception of the strip club scenes, which were really the only salvageable scenes in the entire movie.I really expected more from Mike Nichols, who directed the Graduate, a masterpiece where this was more like a flop. Some movies you can seek out the good points even if you dislike it in its entirety, but this had nothing short of the strip scenes and the cast to fall back on, and in the end that just wasn't enough.I give it a 1/10. I was going to be generous and give it a 2, but that Damian Rice song, that just wouldn't go away, happened to be the straw that broke the camels back.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance

"Clearly a play adapted for screen, Great Acting Though.","Closer is a movie about love, sex and adultery. And the how the four main characters cope with those things. Watching this movie with your own lover gives you something to discuss about.The best thing about the movie is the performance of three of the four actors. While Jude Law (as Dan a obscure writer) Julia Roberts (as Anna a photographer) and Clive Owen Larry (a dermatologist) stand out. Natalie Portman (as Alice former stripper) degrades the movie in her moaning performance. While her good looks compensate a lot she can not stand out against the rest of the cast.While the acting performance is excellent the movie can not shake of it's background as a play.

Relationships on the Rocks,"Closer takes the cake for being a rollercoaster of messed-up relationships and questionable life choices. Directed by Mike Nichols, this romantic drama is like a crash course in how not to do love with Alice, Dan, Anna, and Larry, a quartet of characters who seem to think honesty is optional in relationships. The film opens with a meet-cute that's more like a meet-brutal between Dan and Alice, setting the tone for a series of messed-up encounters. It's a bit like watching a train wreck - you can't look away, but you're also thinking, ""What on earth am I witnessing?""Closer tries to dissect the complexities of love and relationships, but it feels more like a dysfunctional puzzle with missing pieces. It leaves you questioning whether anyone in the story knows what they want or if they're just playing emotional hopscotch. The dialogue is sharp, but it's the kind of sharp that cuts deep. The characters take turns hurting each other with words, it's like they're on a mission to see who can be the least likable, and spoiler alert, it's a tough competition.In the end, it's like a love story gone wrong, a cautionary tale about the perils of bad decisions and poor communication, a reality check for anyone who thinks relationships are all sunshine and butterflies. If you're in the mood for a romantic drama that's heavy on the drama and light on the romance, then this might be your cup of bitter coffee.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Nichols and the Four Principals Overcome the Film's Hopeless Misogyny,"It is unlikely I have seen a more misogynistic film since Neil LaBute's ""In the Company of Men"", but director Mike Nichols uses his uncanny ability to delve deep into the human condition to come up with a challenging, superbly acted and at times surprisingly empathetic film about four self-absorbed, unsympathetic people. I'm not sure what other director could have been better qualified to translate Patrick Marber's stinging, cynical play set in an urban chic London. As he has proved from his 1966 debut, ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?"" through 1971's ""Carnal Knowledge"" to ""Angels in America"" last year, Nichols knows how to humanize the brutality and emotional pain that people can inflict on each other. This master's skill is what prevents this 2004 drama from shriveling up into a wearing exercise in manipulation and deceit.Writing the screenplay from his own play, Marber provides dialogue that is alternately sharp, observant and harshly erotic. At times, his acerbic work reminds me of Frederic Raphael's superb 1960's screenplays for ""Darling"" and ""Two for the Road"". The story that brings the four characters into a sexual intersection of tête-à-têtes and one-upmanship does get rather convoluted. The film covers about four years in elapsed time but takes liberties with scene transitions, focusing on the beginnings and endings of relationships and consequently complicating the chronology and timing of events, sometimes unnecessarily. Suffice it to say that each character figures out his or her capacity for hurting someone else and then goes about feeling empowered, guilty or some combination of both. It is telling that there are hints and often threats of physical abuse in the dialogue, but nothing is executed until a final, defining slap, filmed in slow motion, of course.The acting is uniformly strong, though I believe the ""beautiful people"" aspect of the casting does distance the actors from the audience, perhaps intentionally. I am not a huge fan of Julia Roberts, but she surprises as Anna, the photographer who becomes the focal point of a shark-infested triangle. Looking rather sallow and absurdly thin, Roberts doesn't come across as all that attractive here, but her sullen demeanor seems to free her from the contrivances Hollywood has offered her for the past fifteen years. It seems inevitable that she is now playing the older woman archetype now, and she accepts her fate with a seasoned truthfulness that propels the rest of the characters. That she gives the weakest performance among this quartet is a tribute to the high caliber of the talent involved. At first, the overexposed Jude Law plays Dan, the ethically challenged writer who fails as a novelist, as a hopeless romantic, but what he gradually uncovers is a tormented soul weakening under the burden of his deceptions. It's a brave performance especially since his character is the one most willing to hurt the others deeply for his own selfish motives.Playing Larry, the equally manipulative and sexually insecure dermatologist, Clive Owen finally sinks his teeth into a role that makes the most of his swarthy on screen persona. His emotional nakedness and bull-in-a-china-shop approach to his problems make a brutishly affecting counterpoint to Law's rather effete character. And in what amounts to a revelation, Natalie Portman is alternately vulnerable and bruising as Alice, the stripper who falls hard for Dan and won't give Larry the intimacy he needs when he is rejected by Anna. Eschewing any trace of the child actor she was, Portman tantalizes with her flighty sexuality and then grounds her character deeply when she is subject to an excruciating break-up from Dan. Her character's evolution, however sketchily it is presented, is the only one that achieves a poignancy that nearly transcends the story's cynicism. I have to admit the unrelenting tone does induce a numbing effect that makes you wonder why you should care about the fate of any of the characters. But leave it to Nichols to make you want to know what happens to each of them. The only significant extra in the 2005 DVD is a music video of Damien Rice's ""The Blower's Daughter"", which is used effectively as a musical bridge for their comings and goings. Highly recommended though don't expect to feel life-affirmed afterward.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
A play within a film by Mike Nichols,"I have neither read nor seen the play this film is based on, but Mike Nichols does not attempt to take ""Closer"" outside the parameters of a filmed play. I don't mind that technique, Nichols has filmed many a play and he is so very good at it. Any problem the film may have is likely a reflection of the play itself. I'm guessing that Mike Nichols did more with this play than any other stage director could. I happen to really like plays about relationships between men and women, but I had the sense that the dialog was a bit too influenced by David Mamet. While the play's ideas and narrative were fine and thoughtful, I think it would have been a better play if it wasn't so derivative of Mamet. Only Mamet should do Mamet, and this playwright would have been better off using his own voice. ""Closer"" is an example of how a great director and great performances can elevate a play that is good enough, but maybe not as good as these players' skill at interpreting it.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Wow! Not for the prim and proper but outstanding.,"CLOSER is nothing like advertised. The language in the movie is over the top compared to just about any movie ever seen. However, it is most appropriate for the story. Julia Roberts is outstanding as usual in this most unusual role for her complete with language that will not be for those of feint heart. We loved it. Natalie Portman is not an innocent beautiful young girl anymore, she is a full fledged Hollywood beauty in a role that even her OB/GYN father would blanch at. She is however fabulous. Jude Law also gives a terrific performance as he normally does. Newcomer Clive Owens is the perverted one, who also gives a very strong and very raw performance. Don't know where he came from but I'll bet he will be around for a long long time.Oscar will have a hard time picking who will it list from this movie. Mike Nichols direction deserves an Oscar.

I guess depressing drama just isn't my thing.,"Lent to me by a friend who has got this major thing for Ms. Portman, Closer is indeed compulsory viewing for all fans of the pretty little minx; after all, it's probably the closest you'll get to seeing Queen Amidala in her undies, without trawling the internet for candid paparazzi shots of her on the beach.But even witnessing young Natalie sexily cavorting in a spangled bra and tiny G-string didn't compensate for subjecting myself to this rather pretentious waffle about life, love, and betrayal. Mike Nichol's study of the complexity of relationships features four of the most unappealing characters to ever appear in one film; great to look at maybe, but still unappealing. They lie and cheat to those they care about and, although that maybe the point, I guess I'm an old romantic at heart and spending 104 minutes watching people betray those they are meant to love is just not my bag. If I wanted to spend that long seeing how much idiots can hurt each other, then I'd watch Jackass The Movie.However, it must be said that the talented leads (Jude Law, Ms. Portman, Julia Roberts and Clive Owen) are extremely good in convincingly portraying the four screw-ups destined to never be content with their lot, and if morose drama is your cup of tea, then I guess you'll love this movie.",4.0,Anonymous,Romance

likely fallen for this film when I was 20,"I would have likely fallen for this film when I was 20 years old. The dialogue is masterful and the four principals give fantastic performances. Scenes from the film will likely become audition pieces for aspiring actors. However, the film seems to be simply a vehicle for the sharp dialogue and a series of powerful, emotional scenes. The characters' motivations were unclear with the most obvious explanation for actions being, ""well they were just a little messed up."" A great movie/story need more clarification than that. I have not seen the play from which the material is adapted. I imagine that the story/script would work better as a play.

Get Ready to Get Closer,"If you have ever wanted to confront the brutal truth and lies about human relationships, then get ready to get Closer.Be warned - this film pulls no punches and quite intentionally shocks and offends us through the script and the characters. It will relentlessly draw you in and spit you out at the end. If you want warm and fuzzy romanticism, stick to When Harry Met Sally or Ghost.Mike Nichols takes us, so successfully, into the darkest and warmest depths of the human heart in lust and love and thrusts us into a web of relationships where identities are withheld, selflessly revealed and even emotionally raped.This masterpiece depiction of who we are as individuals and why we are certain people to some and other people to others will command you to examine your own identity and re-evaluate your views on love, lust and relationships.Natalie Portman's performance as Alice/Jane is spectacular from start to finish. She delivers this massively complex character to the screen with brilliance. But keep up or you will miss the diversity (and yet simplicity) of her character. Clive Owen delivers a remarkably brutal honesty as Larry. You will love and hate him at the same time.This movie tells it how it really is. It is thought-provoking, to say the least. Where other movies have skirted around the raw and real, Closer grabs you by the scruff of the neck, slaps you in the face with a wake-up call and reminds us that these characters exist all around us, if not within us ... we just don't like to admit it or talk about it and we most certainly don't want to be confronted with it.They are real, fake, honest, deceitful, loving, ruthless, caring, selfish, likable, loathed, unbelievable and believable. You decide! To truly enjoy this movie, I would recommend that you pay very close attention to the dialogue. Every word, sentence, action and reaction is a revelation of character. If you miss the dialogue, nothing will make sense and you will walk away from this masterpiece feeling disappointed.Get comfortable, forget everything you think you know about relationships, put your seat-belt on and enjoy the ride of your life into the beauty and ugliness of the human spirit.This is by far the best film I have seen. If you cannot handle the truth and you prefer to be kissed before you are slapped to a rude awakening, then steer clear of this one!",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
A nearly flawless film that holds your attention,"Closer is one of the best films of the year and was defiantly snubbed from the Oscars. Julia Roberts, Jude Law, Natalie Portman and Clive Owen play four strangers in London who fall in love, and then betray their partners with each other in Patrick Marber's adaptation of his own award-winning 1997 play. I had heard of the play before and it sounded really good so I saw this film. In one word this film is amazing, The acting, writing everything is top-notch and this is a must see for any movie fan. Its a thoughtful look on adult relationships and the result it pretty good. I thought the best actor in the cast was Natalie Portman, her performance is so good and its probably better then you would expect it to be since she's so young. Julia Roberts is the worst out of the four but that doesn't mean her performance was bad. I usually don't like her that much but she certainly surprised me. Jude Law is a good actor and gives a great performance as well. Last but not least is Clive Owen, I haven't really heard much about him but after this film I will defiantly be checking out his other work. Mike Nichols does a great job of directing and he was certainly snubbed from the Oscars. The dialog is great with a lot of sharp lines that may have turned some people off. The film is somewhat depressing and its hard to feel sorry for the characters but the film doesn't expect you to. The movie is only 104 minutes long and its not hard to follow the story either. The film is not completely realistic though, like I had some trouble believing some stuff but I wouldn't look too much into them.

"""Closer"" is Worth Your Time","""Closer"" is a psychological romance film that is worth seeing if you are interested in characters who are deceitful. The strongest aspects for me were the script by Patrick Marber based on his own play, and the acting performances of Clive Owen and Natalie Portman. There were numerous moments of laugh out loud comedy in this movie just from the sheer wit of the script. If you are into British humor, this is a must watch. And this may be a hot take, but I don't think I've ever seen Clive Owen better than this. I completely understand why he was nominated for best supporting actor for the academy awards, and actually won the BAFTA for this role. Portman steals scenes and was a knockout from a visual standpoint (you'll know what I mean if you watch this). Nichols as the director shows his craftsmanship with a story that is rather grounded and doesn't try to be overly dramatic. I highly recommend this to anyone with a Netflix subscription and looking for a romance movie where the saying of ""love is pain"" has never rang more true.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Utterly utterly utterly stupid.,"Take four unsympathetic characters and slam them into one other in a series of contrived meetings. Then hop forward a few months at a time to some equally contrived decision points in their relationships. And at each stage make sure that they make absolutely the most unconvincing and ludicrous decision possible.This is without doubt the most infuriatingly unbelievable film I have ever seen. I had to suspend my disbelief less for South Park Uncut. Nothing that any of the characters ever say or do is even remotely plausible.After the first half hour the film becomes risibly predictable because you know that whatever choices the characters are faced with, they will take the most preposterous option. At one point I thought ""if Julia Roberts does X now then this is the worst film I've ever seen"" ... I clearly wasn't alone as when she did (inevitably) do X, a neighbour stood up and walked out of the theatre.Oh ...

I loved this movie,"I saw Closer three times in the theater and it gets better every time. This movie did something to me that it is not very easy to do. It made me enjoy Julia Roberts as an actress. I have seen Runaway Bride and My Best Friend's Wedding and she is really horrible. It just shows though, if given the right direction and dialogue, an actor can do anything. These four actors shine and really impressed me with their realistic portrayals. Jude Law's character of Dan was everything that Jude himself is not---pathetic, weak, insecure, and needy. Well, I guess I don't know that for sure. But it seems that way. His ""I have to see you---you kissed me"" was one of the best lines of the movie and really helped establish him as a whiny playful love obsessed guy. Natalie Portman's performance was also very good. A lot of people say she acts like cardboard. I guess they must have been watching a different movie than me. The shining performance of the movie was, hands down, Clive Owen. Wow. This guy is talented. His delivery, his glares, his facial expressions, his reactions to others. It was all so crisp and precise. I was blown away. This movie is 90 minutes or so but feels so much quicker because I got wrapped up in the story as soon as I saw Natalie Portman's ""incident"" in the beginning. I hope this wins something at the Golden Globes! 8.5/10",,Anonymous,Romance
"""Closer"" may be an adaptation, but it feels like a contrived play","""Closer"" is based on a play which analyzes modern relationships. It's set in London and it features two Americans (played by Julia Roberts and Natalie Portman) and two Brits (Jude Law and Clive Owen). I don't know if the insistence on this particular gender and national divide possesses any significance to the overall story, but the overall story seems to be unsure of its own purpose - so in the end the question itself is questionable.""Closer"" reminds me of ""Lantana,"" the Australian film with Barbara Hershey and Geoffrey Rush, which I think is a much better film (also based on a play, might I add). Both films deal with relationships, but while ""Lantana"" focuses on trust being the key to a relatively successful relationship, ""Closer"" takes a much more misanthropic view underlining that sometimes honesty can compromise love as well.And even that statement is not an entirely accurate assessment of the film's purpose because ""Closer"" makes many jumps. Whether they be logical, psychological or temporal - I don't think the story rings as true as it was intended to. Now Mike Nichols is a phenomenal director with great films under his belt, and some great play adaptations (among them ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?"" and the recent ""Angels in America""), but ""Closer"" is far from his best. It's actually beautifully directed, shot and, let me tell you, full of impressive performances. Jude Law shines as always, as does his antagonist, Clive Owen who gives a particularly good performance as an honest brute. Julia Roberts surprised me as the woman for whom both Jude Law and Clive Owen's characters fall. Natalie Portman seemed miscast to me - she was incredible in ""Garden State"" and she has great range and talent, but in ""Closer"" it feels like she can't find her place.The story is fairly simple, when it really boils down to it. Guy 1 falls for Girl 1. Then, Guy 1 falls for Girl 2, and accidentally sets up Guy 2 with Girl 2. Girl 2 and Guy 2 fall for each other, get married and Guy 1 gets jealous and leaves Girl 1, for Girl 2. Girl 2 leaves Guy 2 for Guy 1 and wackiness ensues.The problem with all this is how profoundly contrived the entire story, the betrayals, lies, truths and the reactions to them seem. They are not realistic and rather serve to motivate the developments in the story rather than compliment them . Aside from the lack of realism (and I mean, we've all had some bad relationships - but some of the scenes in this film just don't seem to reflect what people behave like at all), it is not quite clear as to what the film tries to say. I know it suggests that by abusing people's trust we jeopardize the relationships we share with them. On the other hand, it also suggests the opposite by showing scenes where characters honestly admit to perfidies committed ending relationships as well. In ""Closer"" no matter what you do, your relationship is essentially doomed. The concept of ""love"" or ""a decent relationship"" (i.e. one that may still need work, like most relationships in life, but a decent one) is simply nonexistent.Furthermore - it seems like the contrivances of the story serve to support this theme rather than reflect reality. There is a scene where a character re-enters a relationship with another character that is simply inexplicable. And the idea that the entire story revolves around only four people is far too convenient for me to accept - this isn't the story of Stevie Nicks and her shenanigans with the members of Fleetwood Mac - this is a story that purports to speak about modern relationships which, last time I heard it, sounded general, not specific.""Closer,"" despite great performances and confident direction, is a play at heart, and a contrived one at that, like many plays are. It doesn't go for brutal realism (except maybe in its verbal frankness - and some of the dialogues are indeed exquisite), but for forced point-making. We're not getting the privilege to view these characters' lives for a few years - they appear before us and act out a man's idea of what relationships are like. We're not observers as much as recipients of symbolic scenes whose meaning is forced.However, don't get me wrong. ""Closer"" has moments of uncanny insight and all in all holds your attention entirely for its two hour span. The problem, though, is that at the end you feel as if you've been tricked and manipulated. The film tries to conform you to its subject matter, rather than honestly portray it so that you can reflect on it.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Another entry in the adult's mature school of film-making.,"Mike Nichols brings us an exercise in love and poses some complex - some pretentious - questions about the nature of humans. The motif that generally brackets each scene as repetition of the last with different variables could be taken as a statement that we are all the same as humans, that it needn't matter if it's Natalie Portman and Jude Law arguing or Julia Roberts and Clive Owen. That love is as material as those advertising it. Or it could be that it shouldn't be taken that far, and it is actually a simple examination of our nature as lovers: to love; to quarrel.But whatever the film's repetitive structure is supposed to pertain, the film is ultimately a purposely complicated result of pseudo-maturity. The relentlessly ornamental dialogue is beautiful, and sounds like post-modern Chandler in a romance-drama setting. And for all its tricky one-line-ruminations, it gives the film a scent of Nouvelle Vague surrealism that would be - and IS - stale in any other modern movie. Nichols' direction is as stagely as the dialogue - not to say that it's theatrical - and gives the film a sense of refreshment. The London mist and grey-white streets, accompanied by Goldblatt's bare cinematography and the sparely tragic Damien Rice soundtrack all seat quietly next to one another to finish off the film's hush and lull sensibility.The actors, too, are superb, and each withhold their characters with reassuring strength. The real darling of it all, however, is the overall feeling of conception about it. In the same way music can be conceptualised into a purposeful evocation of any theme, Closer is a document of love, and how it affects us, though not on such a large scale: it is a document of love affecting four people, and how they affect us.This film is, for those who like to analyse-beyond-the-artist's- intentions, uncharted territory. But for shallower viewers, and viewers with more insight than either alike, Mike Nichols' 2004 outing is one that will be most enjoyed by those who believe maturity means being angry and upset.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
A classic that will be in film schools,"I saw a sneak preview of this film and thought it would be good but was stunned by its unique flavor and strong character arcs that leaves you wondering if you're watching a Mamet play or a classic film.The story gets more and more complex and the acting is so superb that it adds a certain believability to it that would lack with a less reputable cast. Jude Law is as always sensational as a variant of his Alfie charaacter, and Natalie Portman has reached a level of maturity that was truly surprising, not to mention wearing some of the sexiest stripper outfits one can imagine. And Clive Owen is a perfect match for Jude that turns into a perfect ego cock match that creates so much delightful drama that you wonder how far they will push the edge. There are parts of the story that seem a bit far-fetched but its Hollywood baby so with this stellar cast you let a few issues like that fly because you truly are at the edge of your seat wondering how twisted these two pairs of lovers will get.If you happen to have just finished with a relationship or been cheated on recently id highly advise to bring your heart ready for rampage or lots of tissues but its depth is so provocative that you leave the theatre with so many questions about your own personal life - which personally is what makes the difference between a basic movie and a magical one that literally makes one believe you're watching a true story.Enjoy and hope you never run into one of these characters.!",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

Dan, has just got off publishing a book about Alice's life and is being photographed by a photographer named Anna, who he soon gets a crush on and starts seeing. Also a lonely doctor named Larry, finds Anna at an aquarium after a cruel dating joke on the internet and soon falls in love with her. The characters can't settle on one love though and through the film they all end up hurting each other with betrayal and lies after all four of the people meet. Winner of The NBR Award for Best Acting By An Ensemble at The National Board Of Review. Closer, has good direction, a good screenplay, great performances by everyone involved (including an Oscar worthy performance by Natalie Portman as Alice, and Clive Owen as Larry), good cinematography, good film editing and good set decoration. Closer, has great dialogue with rich and fascinating conversations the characters indulge in, the film has a great ensemble cast and is well made, as a well thought out script, some very powerful and emotional scenes, it is fascinating, compelling, a good character study and is an entertaining and well made film. The end seemed to drag and felt a little long at times but that is only a minor complaint. A very good film which I hope gets nominated for it's great dialogue filled screenplay and excellent performances by Natalie Portman and Clive Owen. One of the year's best films.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Disturbing and pessimistic,"I found this movie difficult to watch because of its content. It was based on a play and even though I didn't know that before I saw it, I realised immediately because of the quality of the dialogue and the lack of reality in the situations. As in some plays, I felt that the author was experimenting with human relationships, to see how extreme he could make them. At the start, I felt I could understand what was happening in the relationships, but as the movie progressed, some of the things that happened were so implausible that I found it hard to remain interested. Having studied relationships in real life, I wasn't shocked by the language or what the characters did, I just found it unbelievable.It works as a study in how people can behave and interact, but not as a reflection of a reality that I have experienced. There was no sense of real love or genuine caring there, the partner switching happened too quickly, none of the characters won my sympathy and in the end, I didn't care what happened to them. The best thing I can say about it is that at the end, I felt really glad to be me, because my life is so much better than theirs (whatever I might feel about it the rest of the time). However, the performances were great, especially Natalie Portman and Clive Owen.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
A Fascinating Adult Trip into Life...,"I saw Closer when it opened here and was not expecting a beautiful time with it. Having been a fan of the stage play and seeing the cast I was not flat out pleased. However, the one thing that I liked was Mike Nichols.He is a brilliant director who has proved he can adapt anything or create anything into art. So the next good thing about this piece was using Patrick Marber (the playwright) to adapt his own play (ala Tony Kushner adapting Angels in America [another brilliant play adaptation]).So I sat down and began to relax...The title came up and a song began to play and I was plunged into the most fascinating movie on adult topics, with adult speech and adult emotions that I can ever think of. This was a brilliant piece of art.I must say that the love square: Julia Roberts, Clive Owen, Jude Law, and Natalie Portman were astounding in their scenes together, functioning opposite each other. And Julia and Jude Law seem to have more experience on film but the real standouts were Clive Owen and Natalie Portman.Clive Owen has been constantly good and a brilliant actor in his work thus far in his career, but gives the performance of his life in this. I hear the Oscar bells ringing.Natalie Portman has always been my guilty pleasure even in the Star Wars movies and between her performance in this and Garden State, I will be disappointed if she doesn't at least get an Academy Award nomination.Again, it was a beautiful movie for the 18 and up age range just based off of emotional content and adult situations.***** A+++",,Anonymous,Romance
So close...that it's world apart,"The tag line of Closer states When you believe in love at first sight, you never stop looking. It lives to the tag line, but not everyone has the equal opportunity to showcase their talents in Mike Nicolas's latest drama.Natalie Portman steals the limelight in Closer from Julia Roberts. She has grown up from her previous role in Star Wars, where she was better known as Queen Amidala and Mathilda from Leon: The Profession. She takes the challenge of playing a woman looking for love in London, where she worked as a waitress and a stripper. Her role of a woman looking for love becomes the main attraction, where audience would focus on her over Roberts, who plays a photographer passing through the post-divorce phase. Robert's performance is plain, without giving more scenes to explore her talents further. Her role also explains why Portman over shines her.Jude Law is still the main focus in the film, even though Clive Owen is catching up. Playing a reporter and a doctor respectively, both are connected to Roberts in certain ways: Robert's was Law's photographer for his upcoming book, Owen is the victim of a prank by Law, where he was arranged to meet Roberts. In any case, the trio (Roberts, Portman and Owen) are related to Law, but the trio may not necessarily be close to each other. This results in a complex relationship the 4 involves, and bears the consequences they would never forget.Mike Nicolas brings the British drama play onto the big screen with confusion. The relationship itself is confusing, let alone the presentation itself. Flashbacks were inserted directly into the film, without any elaboration before the appearance of the flashback. In fact, certain issues were not mentioned, and it just happens. However, the plot has saved the movie from failing. The gripping performances of Portman and Owen has not only gained themselves an Golden Globe award each, but also makes the audience wants to go for more.The choice of using Damien Rice's The Blower's Daughter as the theme song is another factor why Closer deserves my 7/10 grades. 'I can't take my eyes for you'has sold the idea of the movie to the audience who is not too sure of the plot. The arrangement of the song at the end of the film also gives the movie a full round-up of the film.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Perfection,"This film is pure perfection. The Direction is top notch. I love the way it is shot and the editing that conects this shots. The writing is amazing and very realistic. The way characters interact with each others seems very realistic. The movie is basically conversations and some topics of those conversations don't happen on The screen. The acting is amazing from the 4 leads (Julia Roberts, Jude Law, Natalie Portman and Clive Owen). I love that the first and the last scene are almost the contrast and also one twist involving Natalie Portman made me realize that we really never know 100% someone. It is One of The films that represents relationships and humans in a very realistic way. If you like films about humans and about relationships this is definetely something you need to check, also for a 2004 film, it aged extremely well.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Its OK,"I write this review on the sole basis of the movie. I have not seen the play, I don't want to see the play, I don't like plays. There I said it.Closer is a movie that as a whole has a good message and a lot to say, but when looked at from scene to scene, little adds up. Before I tear into this one, I will focus on the positive.Again, I did get the message and I could relate to what the film had to say. On that basis I have to give Closer a positive recommendation. The acting is decent all around, but any dramatic believability the film carries is due primarily to Clive Owen. He plays the honest character and also gives a more honest performance. Jude Law is good, but he seems stuck to the rhythmic stage dialog. Owen does more with his lines than anyone else. Natalie Portman is cutesy, but, and I mean this, she isn't a very good actress. Julia Roberts struggles to convince not only with her lines, but playing a photographer, you need to at least know how to hold a camera convincingly. How hard is that to learn?The movie's massive fallibility is in its stage roots. Closer is not very cinematic and because of that, not very convincing. There is too much ""play"" between the actors with their wordy rhythmic exchanges. NOBODY TALKS LIKE THAT! Again this comes from my distaste for the stage, and I have even more distaste for filmed plays.In the end, Closer succeeds in holding your interest thanks to some good humor and the ever honest Clive Owen.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Good performances from Law & Owen overcome unlikeable characters, story gaps","A good performance from Jude Law and a great performance from Clive Owen help elevate Mike Nichols' flawed Closer. The story centers around four rather unsavory (but attractive) characters who use and abuse each other unmercifully, but attempt to let each other down as gently as possible. The movie covers about 18 months of this story, but we primarily get the break-up scenes after the relationships of Dan (Law) and Alice (Natalie Portman), and Larry (Owen) and Anna (Julia Roberts) are established. These scenes are pretty intense, and contain language that will probably shake up a good deal of Roberts' loyal audience. These are the scenes that Owen shines in, as he shifts from wounded animal to drunken anger to conniving weasel effortlessly. It wouldn't be out of line to suggest a nomination of some kind for his work here. I had a few cosmetic problems with the film. Portman wears the same hair-do that she had for The Professional, and as a result looks like she's about 16, tops. Her performance is good enough, but I think someone with a few more miles on them, not quite as angelic-looking, could have given the film a little more punch. The half-year gaps in the story didn't help, either, as the attraction Dan & Larry had for Anna was never sufficiently fleshed out for my tastes. Let's be honest, these two don't exactly look like they would have much trouble finding women, and why they chose to fight so vigorously over a cold fish like Anna was a little perplexing. Roberts has the most difficult role to play in the film, as she is basically the prize that Larry and Dan are fighting over, and she serves as sort of a verbal punching bag for Law and Owen to spar with. She does an admirable job, but the two male leads, especially Owen, carry the film.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
The Most Honest Movie I've Seen,"I saw this movie yesterday, and thought it was amazing! i mainly saw it b/c of Jude Law and Natalie Portman and it was just great. i'm don't usually like dirty movies but this one had a point to it. i know this is how people act in real life. they were brutally honest, it hurt. i really felt for the characters, especially Alice and Larry. I think Natalie Portman and Clive Owen should definitely win an Oscar. This movie has made me love all these actors even more (i wasn't really into Clive Owen before but now everything has changed). i recommend all see this movie. it will teach you about life and hurt, it's a must-see. not all will like the language but you need to see how spectacular these actors are. it will be a little confusing but i think Mike Nichols did an excellent job.

"When the heart battles with the conscience, we come one step closer to the truth","Movies that contain an all star cast are rarely worth talking about. Not that 'Closer' is an exceptional movie, however it is worth talking about. It's not a film that sends the emotions sky high; nor is it exciting or inspiring. But, it is thought provoking and incredibly intense. Sometimes it can even be hard to listen to. There really is not so much to see in this movie, as much as there is to hear. The performances were excellent; still I had difficulty hearing Julia Roberts talk and be spoken to in such a way. More than once I had to remind myself that she is an actor and that playing fictional roles is what she does. 'Closer' is a film that pushes the line of censorship that little bit further and really drives the brutally honest and the corrupt side of the heart straight into the vigilant mouth of the critic with a 'cop this' attitude. Sometimes it's hard to know whether to turn your head in loathing, or tip your hat in respect. Bravo to the film's courage, congratulations to the cast and crew, and here's to reality. Go and see the film and make up your own mind. If you're not one to take yourself or life too seriously, you might even get a decent laugh out of it. Enjoy.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
100 more movies like Closer - there are some out there...,"I saw this film Closer last week and yes, it was brilliantly acted but what in the hell does the public need a film like this for? It really opens your eyes to the deceptive sexual lifestyle of swapping and swingers that destroys the American family. They advertise that critics (like Rolling Stone Magazine) states - why can't there be a hundred films like it? What the heck do we need that for? Then I realized what they possibly could mean. If you peel back the deceptive layers of Closer, you realize that the writing, acting and the way the relationships were handled - makes for brilliant story telling. The reason I mention this here, (as I have copied to the Sight for Sore Eyes comments) is that there are films out there that are honest and pure of relationships and not buried under special effects, five kids locked in a cabin as they are slashed one-by-one or films just buried in some slick studio marketing scheme of selling action figures and party favors to children. I truly hope that more films like this do get made, whether or not I agree with the content, is besides the point - but back to basic film-making is refreshing.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Overly schmaltzy, melodramatic and theatrical...and quite dull too","Overly schmaltzy, melodramatic and theatrical...and quite dull too.The story of two couples, Dan and Alice (Jude Law and Natalie Portman) and Anna and Larry (Julia Roberts and Clive Owen). We see how they meet, how their relationships start...and how they end up cheating on each other.Quite dull. It's really just a story of relationship machinations and manipulations for the sake of machinations and manipulations. There is no point, ultimately (except maybe that relationships are doomed to fail so why bother?, but I might be being a bit cynical there...).Execution is pretty stiff and stuffy too. Very wordy, and unnaturally so. Far too much melodrama over things not warranting such drama. You can tell this was originally a play...Quite empty too - superficial, emotionally, and overly schmaltzyOnly two things prevent this from being a total waste of time. One is the humour - there are some great one-liners scattered throughout the movie.The second is the performance of Natalie Portman. She sparkles in her role and got a Best Supporting Actress Oscar nomination for her efforts.Not sure how Clive Owen got his Best Supporting Actor nomination though. His performance largely consists of overacting. He is also the biggest victim of the theatrical script - every line he utters sounds like a speech.",4.0,Anonymous,Romance
Truthful Film,"This was one of the better movies I have seen in a long time. This movie truly spoke to the human condition and showed how distrust, revenge and hate can ruin the lives around you. This is definitely a movie that should be seen, not just for the phenomenal acting but for the imagery as well. The scene where Natalie Portman's characters uses her ""real"" name as her screen name and how that plays out in the end was interesting and gave plenty of food for thought. The switching and the revenge sex that was prevalent throughout the movie was thought provoking. Jude Law's character though reminded me a spoiled child, he wanted to have his cake and eat it too. He could not deal with Julia Roberts' character because she had slept with her ""ex-husband"" though he got her under similar circumstances and goes out of his mind when he finds out that Clive Owen's character slept with ""Alice"". All things considered, this was ONE GREAT MOVIE!",,Anonymous,Romance
A man's idea of the complications of love,"The story begins with the terrible cliché of a conspicuously beautiful young woman and a completely unremarkable man falling in love at first sight on crowded public sidewalk. And from there it does get a bit better.This a movie about love and relationships, written and directed by men -- and It has that distinctive vibe the whole way through. It's a bit cringy at moments. It takes place in a universe where men are guided by their hearts and women are their foils. We witness the men's struggles, their tantrums, their downfalls (of their own making) but the women's are stoically hidden -- take place off-camera, are revealed through the men's dialog. In this film's universe, love is a joke and women are but the punchline.The movie skips forward through the lives of four romantically entangled people to the notable moments of drama. The unusual flow feels like a play more than a film. (The movie is based on a play.) The form does work, once you get used to it that in the next shot a year or more may have passed for the characters.I overall enjoyed it, despite its flaws. It is a film about people, their complicated romantic desires and relationships. So it's about real stuff. And almost nearly does it in a real way.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Love bites, truth stings and it's all very good","""Why is love not enough?"" a tearful Alice (Natalie Portman) asks her boyfriend Dan (Jude Law) at a crucial point in ""Closer.""Her question is at the crux of Mike Nichols' brutal film about love, lust, lies and the lengths to which human beings go to make themselves happy, even at someone else's expense.Be warned: If you go to movies to be entertained and feel good about life, ""Closer"" isn't for you. It's not a fluffy romantic comedy, despite starring Portman, Law, Julia Roberts and Clive Owen. It's a disquieting film that frankly and bluntly discusses sex and human relationships. Also, if you believe, say, the execrable ""The Bird Cage"" (1996) was Nichols' finest work, you'd be better off staying away.""Closer"" recalls Nichols' best work very early in his career, when he made two great movies about relationships - ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?"" (1966) and ""Carnal Knowledge"" (1971). He didn't quite rekindle the same magic in 1986's ""Heartburn.""This time, he comes closer. The characters in ""Closer"" aren't quite George and Martha, though you can certainly picture Larry (Owen) and Anna (Roberts) turning into Edward Albee's famous wedded pair when they get older.What makes ""Closer"" absorbing are two terrific performances by Portman and Owen. Law's acceptable. Unfortunately, Roberts is the weak link. She's a pretty woman adept at playing spunky, lighthearted comedic roles. Even her Oscar-winning Erin Brockovich (Laura Linney should have won that year) was more comedic than dramatic. When it comes to drama, however, Roberts can be downright awful. ""Mary Reilly"" (1996), anyone?Roberts' dramatic range is about as wide as Patrick Swayze's. She runs the gamut of emotions from A to B. In ""Closer,"" she's out of her depth. Whenever she's on screen, you can feel the story sputtering as she struggles with trying to make her role real, something it desperately needs. You see her bland and expressionless Anna - especially during a critical scene with Larry - and wonder how much better actresses with real dramatic talent, say, Cate Blanchett or Natasha Richardson (who played Anna on Broadway), would have been. And how much sharper and more potent ""Closer"" would have been.Portman, on the other hand, is sensationally good as young Alice. Her two performances this year - in ""Garden State"" and here - might just be enough to wash off the bad taste of the next ""Star Wars"" film, if her stiff turns in ""The Phantom Menace"" (1999) and ""Attack of the Clones"" (2002) are any indication of what to expect.Her Alice has the ideal amount of charm, perkiness, vulnerability and confidence. She warms our hearts with her giggle, breaks 'em with her tears. This beautiful young actress has one heck of a career ahead of her.Owen is deliciously smarmy as Larry, a man who simply revels in playing mind games with people, and Law's wimpy enough to be convincing.""Closer"" isn't so much a love story as a chilling tale about what happens when couples lose their spark, when they start tiring of each other and find new people more attractive. People usually lie to keep the harsh truth from a loved one. Not here. These people tell the truth no matter how hurtful it might be. But they also lie. ""Lying is the most fun a girl can have without taking her clothes off,"" Alice observes. ""But it's more fun if you do.""These characters aren't being cruel only to be kind; they're being cruel for the sheer pleasure of it. They may not be completely familiar with one another, but they know which buttons to push. And they do it with such glee. Especially Larry, whose final words to Dan don't simply cut to the bone, they saw right through. And the smug expression on Owen's face is priceless.Patrick Marber's smart script, based on his hit play, often bristles with ferocious honesty. Watching these people prey on each other's vulnerabilities can be painful to watch, yet it's compelling. One particularly candid moment between Larry and Alice stings because neither knows when to stop. That scene would have absolutely sizzled with Blanchett, by the way.The characters are unsympathetic; yet, rotten as they are, there's something awfully interesting about them. Not everything about ""Closer"" rings true. But there are many more true moments than false. ""Everyone loves a big liar,"" Alice tells Larry, and nothing in society today seems to suggest otherwise. Just take a look at who our elected leaders, pop icons and sports heroes are.Genuinely adult films are rare these days. So it's refreshing to watch a film that isn't dumbed-down or pandering to the lowest common denominator. As much as romantic-comedies and action-adventure yarns should be made to keep the masses happy, American cinema would be so much the richer if Hollywood made more films like ""Closer."" The film deals with harsh issues bound to unnerve many because much of it looks and feels real.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
"A bit pretentious, but an enjoyable flick none the less","Closer was an interesting, and entertaining film. This certainly wasn't a film that bored me. But it then equally so, it wasn't that great a film.It struck me very much pretentious film, that with its forward dialog and troubled character we'd all admire its brilliance. But the characters never, for me, went beyond being puppets for the writer or director's amusement. The never felt real or understandable. The dialog felt very much like a stage production (so I wasn't surprised to then see it was based on a play) and much of the dialog was what a lot of us would think in many of these situation, but not say. So this gave it an almost unreal quality at times.The film also had these time jumps, which are totally unclear at first. This caused me confusion, and again just struck me as another chance for them to try and be different, but rather pointlessly so.Some plots ""twists"" are also thrown in, but they may just leave you asking ""Why?"" in confusion instead of ""Why?"" in contemplation.There are some points of particular merit. Clive Owen steals the show with his performance, and puts Julia Roberts (who is typically Julia Roberts) and Jude Law (who is typical Jude Law) in the shade. Natalie Portman was also wonderful, so I found the main scenes between Clive and Natalie were the best of the film.As I said, I enjoyed the film. It's not a bad film. But it's not particularly fathomable. It does things which try to be clever, but ultimately aren't. You know a clever film because it doesn't try to be clever. It tells its story and lets the viewer come to a conclusion, rather than a contrived direction which it wants you to walk down.If you want a film about the flaws of people, and how they destroy themselves and lives around them, then I recommend The Rules of Attraction instead.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
"An interesting, oddly-moving movie","When I went to see Closer last night I wasn't exactly sure what I was in for. I had read a few reviews and knew it was mostly dialogue and that the movie could span months and even years in a few scenes. But the plot looked unique and I love the actors so I drove the extra thirty miles to Salem, the closest theater that had it playing, with a friend of mine to watch it.I was very impressed. The acting was amazing. I especially loved Natalie Portman's performance. The scene with her and Clive Owen's character in the strip club was really fun to watch; definitely new territory for the actress. She is so gorgeous, too! I have known that, of course, but saw it more in this movie. I love the flawless-ness of her face. (I'm envious!) She did a really good job with her character, and was by far the most intriguing character of the movie. She was mysterious, had lots of moods, and lied much more than you realize at first, even though she really is the only ""victim"" of the movie.I liked the job Julia Roberts did just because it was so new for her. I thought that her and Jude had great chemistry and it was nice to see her break out of her romantic comedy roles. Jude did wonderfully, as always, although you inevitably hate his character. Clive Owen, whom actually acted in the original play, did a likewise good job at being very unlikeable.The plot itself was very unique, and although weird at first, I ended up liking it. Especially on the drive home discussing the movie with my friend. I really think its a movie you appreciate more as time goes on. It starts out with the meeting of Jude and Natalie's character and then jumps a year to the next scene where he's written a book using her life (or at least what he thinks his her life) as his inspiration. Here you see him getting his picture taken by Julia's character and they instantly hit it off and start kissing. It's reeling at first, very hard to believe after just watching him fall for Natalie, but once you get into the pace of the movie you stop thinking about stuff like that. The scenes between the characters are so absorbing and their conversations so emotionally charged and shocking that you just live for the moment and the scene in the movie and forget about the fact that you didn't see the relationship lead up to this point.I highly recommend this movie to anyone who is out to see something different-as long as they can handle some very sexually explicit language-and anyone who wants to see well-known actors try something incredibly new for them...and do a very good job at it.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Betrayal and honestly don't go hand in hand,"""Closer"" is a story of the lives of pretty screwed up people that meet by chance. Their chance meetings develop into passionate relationships. Yet, betrayal seems to come naturally to two of them. What makes these characters interesting is that their penchant for betrayal is seasoned by their intense guilt and desire to be completely honest (eventually).The movie kicks off to a fantastic start. Unfortunately, I was not happy with the way it ended. It seemed like a rather simple and uneventful ending for characters so complex. Yet, the acting is of a superior order. The characters are a lot more realistic than most that I see in movies. Furthermore, my rather disturbing sense of identification with the character of Larry (played by Clive Owen) definitely contributed to the appeal of the movie. Larry is a man who has been hurt. He is obsessive and dwells on the inconsequential. This movie is definitely not ""lite fare"". In a sense, it caters exclusively to those that have been in relationships that are far from normal.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Intense, uncomfortably intimate, the movie of the year","This is just an amazing and bruising film. I haven't been affected so much by a piece of art like this since I read Les Liaisons Dangereuses. The film has the same stinging, cynical, and truthful nature. Every line is witty, to the point, and cutting in the worst way (especially those of the caveman of a dermatologist). Every character has an attractive quality to them, but all have disgusting flaws.Nathalie Portman has finally impressed me, and Julia Roberts gave the best performance of her career, Clive Owen is so intense and animalistic (scary as hell), and Jude Law also gives a good performance.Definitely not a first date movie or beginning of a relationship movie, because it will make you question everything about your relationship and relationships in general. In my opinion its the movie of the year cause nobody will leave the movie unscathed, and it doesn't underestimate its audience. It's an adult film, unlike all the rest of those ""inspiring"" sappy Oscar contenders out there that are too pretentious and ultimately juvenile.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Perfect performances,"WOW! I don't care for the premise of the piece but it gives a platform for a masterclass in acting. As I was watching it I thought how it would make a great play, and afterwards I discovered it was, at first, a play in which Clive Owens had been in, on the London stage.. The stellar cast must have been drawn to the depth of the characters and the emotional range they would be demanded of them. Their performances were spectacular.

a very real cockfight,"An updated ""About Last Night,"" Closer is entertaining but boils down to the same old same old: a male cockfight about ownership. Jude Law plays almost the same character here as in Alfie, only in Alfie he was more entertaining and had a better sense of humor. His is the weakest link here, too; I simply don't find him attractive enough to be as convincing as he needs to be to pull this one off. Clive Owen is astounding. Julia shows that she needs not the glitchy girly charms we've come to expect from her, and how refreshing to realize she has true skill backing up those addictive looks. Natalie Portman is, well, hot, but a stripper she's not. She did her best, but east coast genius isn't really what should come peering out of that character. Still: the women are painted real. Good depiction of reality with extraordinary performances, and no fake redemption to spoil the scene. Some flaws, but I liked.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

Closer and closer to real life,"I watched this movie over the internet nearly six years after its release and I'm very sorry for myself for having delayed it so much. Closer took my ideals about love and emotional attachment to another level, in the sense it quite exposed the actual want and outlook of human love and feeling rather than the mostly clichéd portrayal of the same. Usually when we see a movie which comes under the genre romance and drama, we quite often find that the emotions or feelings about love between two people are exposed in a manner which we think is what exactly happens in real life but sadly it is not so, in most cases. Closer, directed by Mike Nichols makes us understand the true nature of human relationships in a diverse and solid style by staying loyal to the real human psychology. Well to start with, this movie involves four people (just four) and how their lives are interlinked by this tricky and invisible rope called love. This rope plays a game with them and finally complicates their life with a near irreparable result. The actors in particular, brought immense life to each character, especially Julia Roberts with her surprisingly young looks, less talking and more of expressions. I did feel rather irritated sometimes with Clive Owen's whining and begging, maybe because I'm not used to seeing him in those shoes. The dialogues between Jude law and Natalie Portman are very interesting and intelligently crafted and both have done a great job. Some scenes in particular were very intriguing like the confrontation between Anna(Julia Roberts) and Larry(Clive Owen) and the final exchange between Dan(Jude law) and Larry felt real. Like every other movie Closer has got its demerits too. The story could have been organized in a more understandable manner, For example, half way through the movie you tend to get confused about who is with whom and maybe even jump to a conclusion of Larry being gay, like I did. Otherwise I felt the movie was perfectly fine with wonderful actors and appreciable music with one of a kind direction. Closer is definitely a must watch for all those who have got bored of or rather hate watching the usual romance of Harry and Sally.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Lingers In My Mind and In My Imagination,"Beautifully appointed film...eye candy to the designer in each of us. This film shocks, to a degree, only because we are not familiar with hearing the way we really talk imitated on the big screen.I like the style of Mike Nichols. And each one of these stars showed me something I had never seen in them previously. Clive Owen has made himself a major star in this film...as has Natalie Portman. Jude Law is more desirable here than I have ever witnessed before and even Julia Roberts who is normally beautiful, looks moreso.I recommend this film to any thinking movie buff who wonders whether or not to spend your good money on it. It sweeps you off to a place not particularly better than the one you live in but most likely more interesting.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
The three years of my divorce wrapped into two hours,"While I thought the characters were interesting, I found it very difficult to watch, as my own marriage disintegrated in a fashion too familiar to these characters. The lies, the half-truths, the inability to distinquish truth from lie after being told so many lies. I could completely relate to the characters in this movie.Though I could laugh with it, it was nevertheless painful to watch. I couldn't recommend this movie to anyone except my ex-. Even then, I have trouble believing she's understand any part of it.This particular film was more like a documentary shot without the shaky hand-held camera. But, like the still photographs the movie mocks as being false, Closer allows only glimpses of the truth behind the myriad lies.I want to be entertained at a movie and I cannot think of a single person to whom I'd recommend this movie. It was very well acted, scripted, and executed on all parts. But it was more painful than pleasant or enlightening.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
What a letdown,"This movie lacked a lot of elements, but above all it was unrealistic and shallow. I feel like I wasted the last 2 hours of my life, hoping there would be some climax or maybe just a linear plot. And don't try to tell me about symbolism... if this is how adult love really is, I have very dire expectations for the future of humanity. It seemed that the screenwriter had some wonderful ideas for argument scenes and exchanges of dialogue, and just filled in the rest of the story. What an absolute bore and complete disappointment. And just so you know, Natalie Portman was the worst cast choice for this role. Not even the bare breasts could keep my husband awake.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
Compulsive but cynical and cold,"Two utterly beautiful American women (Julia Roberts and Natalie Portman), two good-looking British guys (Clive Owen and Jude Law), a sharp script from the writer of the original play Patrick Marber, the London where I live, and music by Mozart - there is lots to like about this movie. It begins romantically as each of four inter-related liaisons takes off in charged circumstances, most notably an electrifying kiss between the Roberts and Jude characters. But this is a milieu created by director Mike Nichols in which words are weapons, loving is lacerating, and infidelity is inevitable. As one character puts it: ""What's so great about the truth? Try lying for a change - it's the currency of the world"".For once, at a little over one and a half hours, we have a film that doesn't over-run its course. Over four years, relationships start and finish and we are left to imagine what went in between. The language is as sexually explicit as any mainstream movie that you'll see, but there is virtually no flesh and certainly no sexual activity on display. For all practical purposes, there are only four speaking roles in this work and each of the actors gives a powerful and persuasive performance. This is a work which is as compelling as it is cynical and cold.",,Anonymous,Romance
G-string quartet,"I'm in two minds about ""Closer"". Is it an accurate portrayal of modern relationships? Or is merely a brilliant conceit, a filmed play with clever dialogue that bears no resemblance to reality? Whatever the case, the message of ""Closer"" seems to be that truth has very little to do with relationships. Truth is something you hear only the moment your relationship is about to end, not while the two of you are together. Truth doesn't bring you closer. It only drives you apart.There's a scene in ""Closer"" that involves a very racy exchange between two unlikely individuals in an Internet chat room. One of the two people chatting is merely adopting an online persona. He is not at all who or what he claims to be. The other is at least true to his nature as a sexual animal -- in his own words, a ""caveman"". Perhaps there is a message there too: that we are truest when we are true to ourselves.The caveman in question is Larry, played with raw energy and passion by Clive Owens. Of the four protagonists, Larry is the most real and true. Alice (Natalie Portman) is hiding behind an assumed identity, though she is ironically a stripper who lays herself bare to strangers. Dan (Jude Law) projects an image of macho bravado, but is actually a sniveling, weepy, whiny little boy lost. As for Anna (Julia Roberts), she is an ice-cold maiden who sees genuine human emotion only as fodder for her artwork as a photographer.All of these characters confuse wanting to be loved with wanting to be needed -- or to dominate and control. And they all confuse wanting to hear the truth with their real desire to be lulled by lies.This film could have explored modern relationships even more deeply. There were hints of sexual tension between Dan and Larry, and between Anna and Alice. The movie would be longer, but the end result would be the same. It seems that, whether you're gay or straight, when it comes to love, nothing could be farther from the truth.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
"A drama through and through--dense, fast, extraordinary, and made cinematic and large","Closer (2004)Mike Nichols made clear in his first film, ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf"" (1966) that he was going to make intense, inter-personal films that carried over the best of serious theater and that were photographically cinematic. He's succeeded like few, if any directors, have. And he's a comic actor, a comedian, at heart, which might explain the humanity and laughs that infuse some gripping situations.""Closer"" is based on a play, and like ""Virginia Woolf"" it has four principle actors whose lives and actions interweave and collide in the most disturbing and believable ways. This core is essential to getting somewhere gutsy. In less than two hours, the nature of this kind of liberal contemporary relationship is plumbed more convincingly that you would think possible.Not that this is exactly a realistic film. It's too extreme, too perfect, too glitzy, too fast to quite accept as ""true."" But it's convincing the way great drama is, and all four actors, amazingly, rise to the occasion. Clive Owen stands out for his charming and very masculine intensity, and Natalie Portman for her self-destructive and angry neediness, yes. But equally important are Julia Roberts in a role where she uses her simpler complexion to open up to a fragile interior, and Jude Law in a role where his tenderness and lack of inner strength are in the end his undoing.Everyone here is flawed, and everyone is admirable. And for a movie to make this clear, and to make a workable, fast plot unfold, in such a compact and beautiful way is a marvel. Nichols is really at the top of his form. If the visual tapestry isn't as mind boggling as ""The Graduate"" and if the plot is not as politically savage as some other earlier films (""Silkwood"" and even the flawed ""Catch-22"" are two), it makes up for it by being really tight. There's not a square inch or a bare second wasted here. In fact, the speeding through a year at a time, from one cut to the next, makes you have to pay attention, though the clues are carefully in place.A masterpiece.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Standard soapbox shennnigans enlivened by sharp dialogue and strong acting,"When journalist Dan (Jude Law) meets Alice (Natalie Portman) after she has been knocked down by a taxi the 2 begin a relationship. Complications arise when Dan falls for photographer Anna (Julia Roberts) after the 2 meet when she takes his picture in order for Dan to promote his new book. Dan decides to pursue Anna and confesses his love to her; however further complications arise when Dan's involvement inadvertently brings Anna and dermatologist Larry (Clive Owen) together whom go on to become a married couple...Despite not being particularly drawn by the initial premise of this film I decided to give it a try based on its fairly high IMDB rating and its strong cast of reliable actors. Whilst Closer is certainly not a bad film, for me, it isn't as good as it could have been either...One thing you have to know going in to watching this film is that it is not a fun ride; all 4 characters at some point or another are deceitful and are all fairly unlikeable - although naturally how unlikeable they all are is variable from person to person. This very facet may prove to be a little off-putting to some, but I think what is worse than this is that you're in the company of several unlikeable people whom we don't really learn a great deal about.The relationships all feel a bit shallow and seem to be built upon very little; to be perfectly honest I could see no real reason why anyone is drawn to anyone whether the couples are together or effectively 'swinging.' To me this is not a particularly insightful character piece as it only ever feels like the writers are scratching the surface with each of the relative personas. There are also quite a number of time-jumps (sometimes months or years at a time) which are a bit jarring considering nothing is really reflected on or explained through the various passages of time; it seems that the marriages and relationships fail as flimsily as they were set-up and despite my best efforts I just couldn't see this as being the brilliant 4 piece character study that others may have seen.Still I have to admit that despite the characters feeling a bit thin and underwritten, director Mike Nichols punctuates the film with sharp dialogue and some really punchy scenes (the scene with Anna and Larry in the strip club is one such notable scene). Nichols also gets very good performances out of his talented cast; the 4 main players are all excellent and do their best to bring their characters to life as much as they can (despite none of them having as much depth as they perhaps should have had).Closer is a decent enough film and is worth seeing, but I feel if the characters had a little more depth and if I was able to gain more of an understanding of them as people I may have found it a little more involving. Despite the obvious moral lesson, the film doesn't offer much that you wouldn't see in your everyday daytime 'soap opera' and I couldn't shake this notion that Closer wasn't much more than a bog-standard soapbox drama with a few bells and whistles thrown in.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Talky, Insightful & Mean","I liked CLOSER a lot more than I expected - I had friends who had seen the popular play in London (it later transfered over to Broadway and did okay in NY - but a much bigger hit in London)- my friends said it was well-written but a little overwrought for their tastes. So I had rather low expectations and I was very impressed with the performances of the four leads - they ALL have their moments - real quiet, REAL moments but Clive Owen and Natalie Portman hit it out of the park. Clive Owen is brilliant in the indie film CROUPIER, did nice work in GOSFORD PARK and continues to grow into a powerful film actor. He is amazing in this film and Portman follows up her solid work in this year's GARDEN STATE with a delicate, emotional performance as a little ""girl lost"" in London who falls madly in love with Jude Law. Law and Roberts also do fine work and even though the screenplay is full of ""written"" back and forth, snappy dialogue and rather cruel putdowns - the whole thing moves at a brisk pace under the steady hand of master director Nichols. An adult movie about jealousy, insecurity and fear - not everyone's cup of tea but if you feel like watching a mature film about troubled relationships - check it out.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Strangely moving, or movingly strange?","For me, Clive Owen was the draw here. Without him, I think this film would have been unbearably boring. The centerpiece of the story was the rather hilarious online exchange between ""Dr Larry"" and the person he thinks is an insatiable nymph.Natalie Portman held up her end of things rather well. Her character possessed an inner strength that most of the others (except Larry) failed to give her credit for. Their exchange in the strip club was fascinating and real -- an intense war of wills.Julia Roberts really was lovely to look at, and her character had more dimension and nuance than much of her previous work.Jude Law? His character was the self-sabotaging jerk who doesn't deserve to win anything.Some viewers may find this film a tad confusing. The jumps in time usually move the story forward, but at times, flashbacks are put in without us knowing until much later. Some may argue that this is an artistic device. I reserve judgment.Is this a love story? Only for some of the characters. In many cases, it's a ""need"" story. I think for the two who end up staying together, it is a love story, in terms of the maturity and growth that is needed to make love work and move beyond infatuation status.If Mike Nichols had written this, I would have had to wonder ""What was he thinking?"" But the fact that he directed another writer's adaptation of a play gives him more credit. It's good to see that he's still active as a director.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Great Art But Hard on the Heart,"Closer to me was a very well done film. The acting was excellent (epsecially Owen and Portman), the writing was top notch and the understated cinematography fit the story perfectly. As well done as the film was however, because of its dark content and the lack of a likable character, I have to say I did not really enjoy the movie. I highly respect it as art and would score it very high for quality. But if one is looking for a ""pick me up"" do not see Closer. In its complex content surrounding almost exclusively the sexual aspects of relationships, the film pulls few punches. Owen comments in the movie, ""the heart looks like a fist with blood on it."" That is how I felt after leaving the theater, a person departing with a wounded heart.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
"""Lying is the most fun a girl can have without taking her clothes off...","""Lying is the most fun a girl can have without taking her clothes off...but it's more fun if you do.""About two months ago, I began a self-imposed hiatus on writing movie reviews. I was a little tired of seeing so much crap make its way into multiplexes and to the top of the box office charts. I suppose I was a tad disillusioned with the landscape of movies and I needed a superbly written script to jog me back in to the ranks of enthusiastic moviegoer. Well, that script lies at the heart of Mike Nichols' new film ""Closer"".Unlike many other critics, I am not typically pessimistic about the current state of modern film-making. I truly believe that more great films are being made each year than in previous decades. However, the unfortunate correlation is that more crap is also being made each year. And consumers and critics alike are forced to sift through the drek in order to find the hidden gems.Golfers say that a round can often be filled with bad shot after bad shot, but that when you finally hit that perfect drive, all the frustrations disappear. I suppose the same is true with movie-going. ""Closer"" is a perfect drive for everyone involved - The stunning cast... The veteran director... And the tremendously fortunate members of the public that will seek this film out in art houses across the country in the coming weeks. It is the kind of film that could put an end to my temporary burn-out and have me once again excited about the possibilities that this magnificent art form has to offer.Alice (Portman) meets Dan (Law) and Anna (Roberts) meets Larry (Owen). The two British men and two American women are all living in London. All four are intelligent and literate, passionate but cynical. They are all able to articulate their emotions and thoughts in ways that seem foreign to most movie characters. Listening to them speak, one can't help but be impressed with their ability to communicate. The script in this film is absolutely fabulous, filled with innuendo and double-entendres, wit and intelligence.The couples, Alice and Dan, Anna and Larry, are linked by Anna's photography. She does portraiture and is preparing for an exhibition. She is hired by Dan to shoot a portrait that will hopefully find it's way to the inside cover of his soon-to-be published novel. He is currently an obituaries writer.Larry is a dermatologist who spends some of his spare time chatting to horny ""women"" on the internet. He is a says-what-he-thinks smart-ass who somehow manages to overcome a tremendously awkward first meeting with Anna. They are soon married.Alice is the mystery guest in this equation. She used to be a stripper in New York, but escaped a bad relationship by fleeing to London. Her rough first meeting with Dan leads to a seemingly loving relationship despite a ten-year age difference.Soon, the couples discover that they are not as happy as they appear. Cracks emerge and the situation leads to a switch of sorts. Anna divorces Larry to be with Dan. Dan leaves Anna to fend for herself, and soon she finds herself stripping again, giving table dances to lonely men... like Larry.The screenplay is vicious. The couples switch and switch back again as they lacerate each other with dialogue meant to inflict heartfelt pain. Some might think these are four horrible people. Some might claim that these are good people driven to cruelty by circumstance and heartache. I think there may be a middle ground in there somewhere.The performances are all genuinely Oscar worthy. Although it is possible that none of them can be considered a legitimate lead character... and by that logic none are supporting characters either. The Academy will have a tough time choosing and it may split the vote. I am sure the cast will get mention for 'Best Ensemble' at award shows that feature that category.The two who stand out for me are Natalie Portman and Clive Owen. Both turn in spectacular roles filled with the gamut of emotions. Couple this outing with hers in ""Garden State"" and Natalie Portman has appeared in the two best films I've seen all year. She will probably be my 'Entertainer of the Year'. 2004 has seen her develop into a superb young actress who has a legendary career ahead of her if she keeps picking roles like these.Clive Owen is a sleek and powerful actor who is able to deliver lines like they are being shot out of a cannon. When you hear him spew some of the hateful things he says to Julia Roberts' Anna, your own feelings will be hurt. He also has some rather sly moments of wit and he is able to craft them in ways reminiscent of Sean Connery, always with a knowing glint and a hidden smirk waiting to reveal itself.Mike Nichols' ""Closer"" delivers dialogue for intelligent adults who are clamoring for something substantially less banal than can be found in most Christmas fare in 2004. It will take a few viewings to fully grasp the complexity and layers of infidelity and betrayal in this film. ""Closer"" studies the human tendency toward self-preservation in the face of gross deception. It is at once a condemnation of human nature and an acceptance of it. I highly recommend the film to all literary adults who are fascinated by the enormous gray areas of love, seduction, trust, infidelity and deception. It will appeal to fans of Neil LaBute's ""In the Company of Men"", ""Your Friends and Neighbors"" and to Stanley Kubrick's ""Eyes Wide Shut"".",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
See it but don't take it as anything more than satire - don't try to like the ideas.,"Have just got back from seeing this film, which i was very excited about because of clive owen... i have to say that this film is very deceiving... do not be fooled by the terribly hatable characters and a script which gets more and more cliché as the film descends into chaos. you should instead delve a little deeper if it has left you a bit cold and annoyed as my main feeling after seeing this film is that i marvel at the wonderful clever ironic satire it provides on modern relationships and our constant search for happiness when we don't really know what we're looking for anyway. the questions raised on intimacy, eroticism, and how to get 'closer' to people are wonderfully refreshing and the whole thing is beautifully acted and somehow nicholls has retained the feeling that this is a play - a play being a work of it's moment, satire, centered on humanity, something personal. i wouldn't say i 'love' it, but i certainly got something out of it. there are scenes of complete originality and spine tingling accuracy also - the realistic fight between roberts and owen and their coarse commentary of sex, portman and owen in the strip club, and portman at the end - there don't think i ruined the plot there did i??",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Nasty X 4,"I am unable to recall a film with characters less appealing than the foursome of ""Closer."" Each character has his or her shade of nastiness that runs through this excruciating film experience.One of the problems is that the dialogue does not provide the star actors (Julia Roberts, Jude Law, Clive Owen, and Natalie Portman) with sufficient motivation for the two pairs of lovers to be starting, ending, swapping, and resuming their relationships. The sudden and awkward transitions leave out the crucial scenes and moments where the relationships change. Out of this muddied and amateurish mess, there emerge three questions:(1) Was this film intended to be funny? If so, the effort falls way short of the satirical writing of Edward Albee in ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?""--a film that was also directed by Mike Nichols.(2) Was this film supposed to be engaging in the psychology of love? If so, the better films in this category would be ""Dangerous Liaisons"" or ""Valmont.""(3) Was this film intended to depict the realities of contemporary romantic relationships? If so, the better film would be ""Cast Away"" wherein we see a much more healthy relationship with Tom Hanks and his soccer ball named Wilson.In the closing credits of ""Closer,"" Patsy Rodenburg (one of the world's leading experts on Shakespearean text) is listed as the dialect coach for Natalie Portman, whose character is from New York. The IMDb bio of Natalie Portman indicates that she completed high school in New York. Did Patsy coach Natalie on her New York accent, or only on her Iago-like line readings?",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
"""I can't take my eyes off you""","The first minutes of ""Closer"", which involve two individuals staring at each other at the rhythm of a song that reminds me of the woman I love are so tender; so captivating, that they make you think you're going to watch the most romantic movie of your life. The thing is you're not.It's beyond imagination where words go, or what words can do. If ""Closer"" knows about something, it's about words. About how to say them, when, and of course, inevitably, why. Patrick Marber's screenplay is brilliant, even when his words are far from spontaneity, because the only point is that they are spoken.When Alice (Natalie Portman) talks to Dan (Jude Law) for the first time, she only speaks two words: ""Hello stranger"". This will be a trademark for the whole film and in other words, a reminder or a sign that actually every word counts. Later on, Alice asks Dan, a frustrated writer who writes obituaries that include euphemisms, to tell her what would her euphemism be: ""She was disarming"", he says.The other two characters (there are only four characters in the film) are Anna (Julia Roberts) and Larry (Clive Owen), who meet accidentally on purpose and fall in love, then get married. On the other hand Alice and Dan live together, love each other; actions simply described that lie in the standards of life.But ""Closer"" doesn't like simple, and explores each detail of these standards so profoundly, so intensely, in a way I've never experienced in a movie before. Yes, there are lot of movies of this type, but ""Closer"" was a play, therefore there's no sense of time in the movie, which makes it shameless.And shamelessly, characters come and go whenever they please. Shamelessly they fall in love lots of times and they do it very fast; shamelessly they screw each other so constantly that they don't even notice it, and disgracefully speak at each other with words that touch even the silence that embraces them.So I go back to my main argument, because this movie is about love, but no in the lovable way, because you can't love the characters because of their actions; there's not even one of them that seems to be doing things right. And you certainly can't love the film, that is good but leaves you unsatisfied and empty when it's over.However, there are things you can love; like the performances. This is the kind of movie where actors get the chance of showing off, taking big risks and carrying their talents to the maximum level. Natalie Portman takes every chance, in what's her most skillful and complete portrayal. Julia Roberts is at the top of her game (like if we didn't know she's a superstar), Jude Law reminds us how moving an actor can be, while Clive Own creates, dedicatedly, the film's most sympathetic and concerned character.You can also love Mike Nichols, because the credit is not all Patrick Marber's; and the German director, with 72 years at that time, directed his actors amazingly, in all these different places, these silences and musical moments, close-ups and still shots, maintaining his reputation of commitment with the work.""And so it is, just like you said it would be, life goes easy on me, most of the time"". You will find the movie hard to follow, because it becomes tedious and repetitive in occasions. It's not great, but it's confident and sure, as you will be after watching it, at least about one thing: that love hurtsA lot.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

"great acting, but such a boring story","It's really intriguing for me to see such an amazing pool of actors gathering to do a film based on such a booooooooring story. As I understand, the script is based on one of these London or New York theater plays dealing with modern relationships. The traditional triangle is here a square and the four characters located in modern London are playing for the about 100 minutes a game of true and deceived love and treason. The problem is that all the atmosphere is so dry and detached from reality. What may be working on stage is not transformed at all into good cinema. I could not get rid of the feeling of filmed theater for the duration of the whole movie, and I have different expectations from a theater play than from a cinema piece of art. What a pity to see the splendid acts of Clive Owen and Natalie Portman spoiled on such thin premises. Jude Law and Julia Roberrts are also quite good, but this film is yet another proof that great acting alone does not make a great movie. 6 out of 10 on my personal scale.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

Hollywood Stars Using Lacerating Words as Sexual Weapons,"""Closer"" seems more about guys and sex than about relationships.It is less a contemporary (including very blunt Internet chat) London take on ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf,"" though there is a similar running theme of truth, lies and mutual fantasies, than a journey into Neil LaBute's scabrous territory where trust can't survive and male careers have a parallel with their possession of females. At least the women are in stronger positions than they were in at the time of Mike Nichols' ""Carnal Knowledge."" This film does make one wonder if the traditional practice of arranged marriages might not be as least as effective as love in serving as a basis for long-term relationships.As a four-hander, it is weakened that Natalie Portman's and Clive Owen's performances blow Julia Roberts and Jude Law away. Owen's character is the showier male, with his hang-ups of rough sex fantasies and obsession with women as whores, while Law's character has some sort of mild mother complex.Similarly, Portman's character is the more intriguingly independent female, recognizing the strengths and limitations of her sexual power over men she does and doesn't love, including passersby in the very naturally ironic closing shots. She is finally the most sympathetic character who we comparatively care about the most.While Roberts almost manages to keep up, Law may be ill-served by the script. His character is practically two different people, one with one woman where he unsuccessfully tries to disappear from his physical beauty, another with the other where he uses it. He enacts them differently with different body language and props, but no motivation is obvious for his changes.Nichols' directing is very involving, effectively opening up a play by opening up spaces, settings and locations. I don't know if the adaptation from the original had to account for the cast, but the script nicely incorporated explanations for having American women in London, as well as Natalie's youthfulness.What didn't work was inconsistent changes in make-up and hair that did not support dialogue claims of a passage of time, as much as even three or four years between scenes, but nothing much changes in how they look, except occasionally for Portman's hair styles.While it's a bit tiresomely arch having Law's character be a wannabe writer, Roberts' character as a photographer works very well for visualization, though her character's motivations are as inscrutable as her portraits.Having a superstar cast as a Hollywood movie adaptation distributed in multiplexes causes audience problems as they were made very uncomfortable by the extremely blunt language, which wouldn't have caused as much of a ruffle in an art house audience, but audiences are just not used to watching these folks talk like this; Oprah's audience on a recent promotion for the film was so nonplussed that Roberts' joked that she had to learn these words for the film. I think independent films have been rated NC-17 for similar language. The language is so lacerating we think we are seeing more explicitness than we are.The music selections are very effective, from the opening use of Damien Rice's ""The Blower's Daughter"" with its repeating chorus of ""I can't take my eyes off of you/I can't take my mind off of you."" But the repeating use of opera for inspiration and dates didn't really make sense for the characters and seemed more to indicate either an avoidance of time passage or that Nichols is out of touch with contemporary culture.At least the strip joint played appropriate music. During Natalie's strip tease I kept thinking of Oprah asking her what her dad would think of that scene and she wryly responding that he's a gynecologist.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Emotional Horror Film,"A crisp sheen of urban superficiality was this viewer's response to Mike Nicholls' cinematisation of Patrick Marber's West End theatre-smash. A conscious decision has been made to juxtapose cool,bright colourisation with a cold, defensive acting style from all the four main actors in the piece. Julia Roberts particularly impresses in a complete subversion of her usual bright, breezy likable screen persona. Here is she anxiety-stricken, brittle, bitchy. It was some surprise to me that award-recognition was not forthcoming here. Doubtlessly, the difficult thematics of the film probably negated any potential commendation.Marber seems to be making the point that in our technologically strong world it is we human beings who lose out. Struggling to find love in a barren century, our humanity is eroded, leaving only sin. Without love, we are nothing.'Closer' is a very difficult film to watch. There are no likable characters and bleakness pervades this 21st century world. I could not watch it again. This film is not entertainment, more a blow to the thinking mind.

It is successful, because it is mandatory to claim to enjoy films like this, even though they are devoid of any single meritorious feature.The cast can't act, (particularly Jude Law playing his usual smug role), and the story has no touch with reality at all. The dialogue is laughable, and pretentious. Closer is invalid and should not even exist.The only spoiler here is the film itself-it will spoil your evening.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
Emotionally Distant,"Nichols paints a pretty grim world where love is a game of deception and manipulation, and sex is wielded by the players as a weapon. It's no less merciless than a deathmatch arena, where the only redemption can be found in loneliness and isolation.The title represents a playful twist to the story. Even though the main characters are physically intimate, they are impossibly distant emotionally. Set in central London, the backdrop is emphasized by a depressing grayish sky. Harsh lighting and cold warehouse-style sets reinforce the emotional desolation of the characters.And fitting to the theme of treachery, the most seemingly vulnerable character turned out to be the deceiver, and the one you trust the most betrays you. At the end, no one is left unscathed and everyone is emotionally bereft.I don't need to reiterate that the film is aimed towards a mature audience. Anyone who is into glitters and pyrotechnics will probably drift into a coma before the movie ends.",,Anonymous,Romance
a challenging film.,"Although I was comPLETEly engrossed in the drama between these characters (on the edge of my seat even!), I have to say one of my friends totally passed out in the movie theater--clearly, this movie is not for everyone.Mike Nichols' ""Closer"" almost seemed like a French movie in English: it is dialogue-driven, with complex characters and relationships. The viewer is not spoon-fed a storyline, and watching it does require some intellectual participation.I suspect many of the negative reviews were the result of unmet expectation--this is not lighthearted romantic fare, nor is it thinly-disguised softcore porn in the form of a Hollywood movie. That being said, I am truly surprised at all comments from viewers horrified by the 'dirty language.' There is a LOT more disputable things in Hollywood these days (heads blown off, gratuitous sex scenes) than a few naughty words. It's really nothing you've never heard before (come on), and I found the lewdness to be necessary and real, and not inserted just for shock value.At times the banter between the characters had a stage-play feel to it, making ""Closer"" a stylized version of reality, but the acting was just about always superb. Even if none of your relationships have ever been so deceptive and twisted, you will DEFINITELY find some aspects of the relationships in ""Closer"" applicable to your own experiences, and you will leave the movie with a lot to think about.If you read the user comments, it seems like people either loved or hated this film. I think that any film that elicits such a wide range of passionate response is worth seeing.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Dan & Anna & Larry & Alice,"In London, pretty stripper Natalie Portman (as Alice Ayres) is struck by a car. Injured, but not fatally, she opens her eyes to see an handsome stranger - he's business-suited obituary writer Jude Law (as Dan Woolf). The attractive twosome begin satisfying sexual urges. Ms. Portman helps inspire Mr. Law's sexy novel. Then, beautiful photographer Julia Roberts (as Anna Cameron) takes Law's picture for his book jacket. Soon, Ms. Roberts and Law are fighting off (temporarily) sexual urges. Next, during a moment alone, Law engages in a laptop sex chat with attractive dermatologist Clive Owen (as Larry Gray). Posing as ""Anna"", Law arranges a sex date for Mr. Owen and Roberts. Eventually, Owen hooks up with Portman.A Mike Nichols-directed film version of Patrick Marber's sex play sure sounds promising. But, with the possible exception of the brief, and more modernly sensible Portman/Owens coupling, the relationships don't really work. The characters have very little understanding regarding love and sexual gratification, despite having a great deal of the latter. It's nearly impossible to care about what they feel. ""Closer"" is certainly well-performed, however. Owen wins the acting honors, by a hair; demonstrating great versatility, he starred in the original play, but in Law's role, as ""Dan"".******* Closer (2004) Mike Nichols ~ Jude Law, Natalie Portman, Clive Owen",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
A Nutshell Review: Closer,"Hello Stranger.Fate allowed us to meet, first as strangers. Then we become friends. We share a relationship, boyfriend/girlfriend, husband/wife. You tell me you love me. I tell you I love you too. But, do we really mean it? How sure are we about it? Will we stray from each other? Will we lie to each other? Or will we be honest about everything, and I mean, everything?Mike Nichols opens The Graduate with Simon and Garfunkel's Sounds of Silence. Here, Closer opens with Damien Rice's The Blower's Daughter, whose lyrics contain the lines""I can't take my mind off of you, can't take my mind... my mind... 'Til I find somebody new""which forms the basis of the movie. ""If you believe in love at first sight, you never stop looking."" says the movie's tagline, and while watching, I was thinking about the loads of questions the movie subtly throws at the audience, about modern relationships, as seen through the eyes of and experienced by its 4 main characters, whose lives and relations become intertwined.Fate allows the accidental (pardon the pun) meeting of strangers Jude Law and Natalie Portman, one a struggling writer, the latter a stripper. They become fast friends, and soon, a relationship develops.But what happens when Law starts to also fall for photographer Julia Roberts? You'll start to ask - does he really love Portman? What's the deal with his feelings for Roberts? Love at first sight? Lust perhaps? Does he even care about Portman's feelings, or is he just selfish, wanting things his way? Is he tired of Portman? And Roberts, at first rejecting Law's moves as she knows he's attached, still finds herself drawn to Law's charms (ok, he's good looking), and giving in. Portman appears in that same scene too, and she can tell that something's not quite right. This was an intriguing 10 minute scene, and the conversations amongst the characters tense.Law and Clive Owen ""meet"" in an interesting way, perhaps one of the more light hearted moments in the movie. Fate again intervenes - Owen and Roberts meet, and a relationship which led to marriage forms. Happy marriage? Think again - Roberts has an off screen affair with Law, and when confronted with it, Owens start to go livid, and wants to know every detail (even where they slept) to justify his betrayal and hurt. Law confronts Portman with the same, and we see the heart wrenching acceptance that Portman emotes. Again, questions are raised - do we sometimes become clingy, that you suffocate a relationship? How do you reveal the truth to the other party, while at the same time trying to cushion the blow? How do you walk away from rejection with your dignity intact? Or could you?Owen and Portman met during Robert's photography exhibition, and again when Owen has separated from Roberts. They meet in a strip club, where Portman has taken up refuge in, entertaining men. This is a poignant scene, where more questions are raised, though in my opinion, it highlights Owen's lust on Portman.What happens then, to the adulterous couple Roberts and Law? Are they happy together? Will someone in such a relation be open to the other party meeting up with an ex? If you're still in touch with an ex, will you tell your current squeeze? Why? Why not? Honesty? Will/Can your current squeeze accept the truth? What more if you slept with your ex?We go full circle at the ending, where you might think that all questions are resolved, all questions answered. There's a twist at the end which leaves you wondering, who's playing who, who's trusting who, who's being honest with who. Is honesty always the best policy? But isn't honesty and trust the basis of any relationship?I commend all four leads in the movie - Law, Portman, Roberts, Owen - they were excellent in bringing forth the various emotions required, and multi-faceted ones in fact. The characters are multi-dimensional, which makes them all the more plausible in real life. Nothing is cast in stone, everyone changes.The movie touched me in a personal way, and I'd bet for those who have / are involved in relationships, you'd feel the same way too - you can probably identify yourself in some of the characters, and how they dealt with themes of love, relationships, betrayal, jealousy, honesty, maybe even sex. The movie has a stark social commentary, which will leave you thinking and perhaps reflecting on your personal relationships.I'd recommend it to everyone. Go watch it, and start pondering.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Gleefully twisted and brutally honest,"Mike Nichols' Closer is the story of a jagged love square between four very different and cynical individuals. Whether its the great acting or the extremely suggestive subject matter, there is just something so satisfying and enjoyable about watching other people's relationship complications.Closer isn't even close to being a perfect film, but it's certainly an enjoyable one. I had a hell of a time with Closer and was fully engrossed with it's purposely flawed characters and it's great balance of tense drama and questionable humor.Closer features four very talented actors at the helm of the project. Julia Roberts, Natalie Portman, Jude Law and Clive Owen all share roughly the same amount of screen time, but each of their characters are developed differently, giving us four emotionally problematic characters to connect with. While the bold and sometimes shocking acts that these characters commit make it kind of hard to directly relate to them as people, the acting displayed here is so colorful and refreshingly honest that it's hard not to feel connected to them, whether it's by pity or compassion. Jude Law and Julia Roberts are certainly the two most emotionally damaged characters of the film and that shows in their performances. Jude Law acts almost childish at times, which sometimes works in his favor, but mostly just makes us feel pity for his sniveling. Julia Roberts, on the other hand, attempts to be the adult in most situations but her actions only come across as steely and ice-cold, which conveniently also describes her facial expressions.Despite these two entertaining performances, Clive Owen and Natalie Portman are the clear powerhouses of talent in the film. Clive Owen manages to create such a sleazy and manipulating character that is so incredibly unlikable that it's honestly quite impressive. It was hard to ignore the fact that I wanted to see his character more, despite how grossly back-stabbing and ignorant he is. This brings us to Natalie Portman. Natalie Portman is easily one of my favorite actresses and I must say that she is at the top of her game here. Her character has so many layers of emotion and personality that it's hard not to commemorate her performance here as she managed to pull off every one of the many shades of emotion with such grace and honesty.While the story is admittedly quite silly, it never gets to the point of unbearably fictional. Despite it's repetitive and unrealistic nature, the story never felt too far fetched as the dramatic performances helped quite a bit to ground the film in some solid probability. The script however threatens to uproot these dramatic performances as it is almost laughably unnatural. There were times where I questioned if the writers were ever even in real relationships before as almost everything these characters say is either ridiculously dirty or just plain stupid. Even this talented cast couldn't completely sell this strange and unnatural script. It's a shame that we couldn't get a less juvenile script, but the cast involved did the best job they could with the subject matter they were given.Closer is a very bold and unrelenting drama. All these characters acted with such ferocity and cynicism, making the entire experience seductively compelling. I couldn't help but be intrigued by the dysfunctionality of these characters' relationships. Despite it's unnatural and juvenile script, the actions of the characters really displayed enough emotion already. Closer is a film that I had a ton of fun watching and will probably soon revisit. Not only was I satisfied by the film's ending, but I was extremely grateful that I have never met people like the film's characters or experienced problematic relationships on their scale. For this, I feel eternally grateful.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

"Too close, maybe","This is a film that hasn't really left the theatre, from whence it came. The original author, Patrick Marber, a hot young British playwright of the 90s, produced an intense theatrical sexual shocker and his participation in the screenplay has ensured that the intensity, confronting dialogue and angry characters remain. There are still only four speaking parts and the twelve scenes (with flashbacks) of the original have been retained. Marber has however toned down the ending, with little effect on the overall impact of the piece. It is a powerful statement on the ability of apparently civilized and cultivated persons to screw up their personal relationships via sexual adventurism.When we first see him Dan the obituary writer (Jude Law), who takes the dazed Alice (Natalie Portman) under his wing, seems like a thoroughly nice guy. A year later, when he shows up at Anna's photographic studio, for a book dustcover photo, he's almost a different person, vain, overconfident and promiscuous. He plays an elaborate practical joke via an internet sex chat room (the most entertaining sequence in the film) and becomes the means whereby Anna (Julia Roberts) meets Larry (Clive Owen), the dermatologist with attitude. The subsequent tangles between the four of them involve a great deal of deceit, manipulation and emotional bullying (though all four never appear in the same scene). Larry in particular, the alpha male, is good at getting his way, though Anne suffers greatly as a result.I'm not going to complain about the acting. I was pretty impressed with Clive Owen, previously seen mainly in detective-type parts. He played the Dan role in the original National Theatre stage production of 1997, and has no trouble with the more robust part of Larry in the film. Natalie Portman is practically faultless as a contradiction in terms, a naïve stripper. Actually, she turns out not to be so naïve, note the name in her passport, revealed towards the end. Julia Roberts acquits herself well in a less difficult part. Jude Law as Dan has a strange personality change part way through as mentioned but manages to make him more sympathetic towards the end.People have compared this film to ""Who's afraid of Virginia Woolf"" and Carnal Knowledge"" both directed by Mike Nichols more than 30 years ago. The dialogue is certainly witty at times and the themes of love, sex and betrayal are certainly similar, but the characters here are even harder to like than those of George and Martha in ""Woolf"" and the Nicolson/Garfinkel characters in ""Carnal Knowledge"". There really is a problem when the audience has the shock of non-recognition, that is it says ""I could never do that. Even if I'd like to.""",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

Well worth it,"Closer is a great movie. At first, I thought that it wasn't very realistic, but, after thinking about it I realized I was wrong.These characters may seem unrealistic to many, but what I see is a movie whose characters ACT on their thoughts, emotions, and feelings (even if they are wrong, selfish, or confusing). Most couples have similar adulterous emotions / thoughts while involved with someone, but many do not act on them, and therefore, still are potentially deceiving themselves and the one they are with.The movie is not meant to entertain or show you character's motivations, thought processes, or development. The movie attempts to show you the result of actions, and how raw the emotions can be.... 'Developing' characters more or showing their 'reasoning' for actions would detract from the message of the movie.Love bites. What is real in love? Is it real? What makes it end? What makes it spark? How does it last? Why do we doubt what we have? Why do we throw love away? Why do we take love for granted? And, why does everything about a person seem like a lie when they deceive you about love?The movie demonstrates the result of the many things that are never said (about love) to each other when dating, courting, or married. Things we try to hide or bury. Doubt, regret, selfish needs, obsessions, unhappiness, sexual desires, weaknesses, greed, etc. The movie is honest, and so it is shockingly good.The characters demonstrate selfish needs without regard to others. Love without intimacy, and intimacy without love. Lies, deceit, manipulation, and games all from people who think they know what they want but don't.... and who think they are playing others, yet are only playing themselves. In the process they show a lack of respect for others and themselves. None of the characters are honest, but all try to achieve fulfillment of their perceived needs, including Alice. Most posts claim Alice as the most 'innocent', which the movie clearly demonstrates she is not. In fact, Alice may be the scariest character, as she is easily able to divide her psyche to adapt and cope to her world to fulfill her needs.The truth hurts. I see individuals and couples behaving(and thinking) in these ways all the time. Sometimes outwardly, sometimes with subtlety. Either way, whether a person acts out on these emotions is irrelevant.....the result is the same, and can have damaging effects to a relationship.This is our society, and if one can't see this, you are either blinded by the romantic mythology of happily-ever-after Hollywood marketing or have your eyes shut to what is real (and hidden) in relationships.Definitely a movie worth seeing.",,Anonymous,Romance
"Truth, love, and art in the 21st century","My rating: 7/10.Closer, which portrays a love quadrangle between four London urban sophisticates (actually three, plus Natalie Portman's stripper character), explores a variety of challenging questions. What is it that separates humans from animals  is it our capacity for forgiveness, or for adhering to the truth? To what extent should a person lie to protect the happiness of others? What is the nature of love in modern-day urban society? What is happiness, and can we even recognize a happy person? When is one being taken advantage of, and when is one properly protecting one's self? It is quite obvious that Closer was originally a play. There is little action, only a few sets, and a huge amount of dialogue. Fortunately, the four lead actors are all up to the challenge. Julia Robert's thoughtful and engaging performance will surprise some people, but I felt that Clive Owen turned in the most outstanding performance, in the complex role of the manipulative Larry. The scene in which Larry reveals to Dan the results of his scheming, reducing Dan to a whimpering shred of a human being, is a masterpiece of power and control, and Clive Owen carries it off brilliantly, with perfect timing, delivery and body language.My primary complaint about Closer is that the storyline is overly complex. By the time the final breakup scene rolls around, after so many other breakups and reconciliations, it seems a bit too much. The very end of the film, when Dan visits the park, does provide an answer for the final breakup, but still, I had tired of the back-and-forth by the end of the film. Closer also does a better job at raising questions that answering them. Viewers looking for principles or even for consistency of behavior among the main characters will be sorely disappointed, as hypocrisy and contradictions abound, but this apparent fact of modern-day life may indeed be one of the messages the film is communicating. If so, it's more than a bit depressing.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Love has never been more painful.,"I'd read only three positive reviews before I saw this movie,and I still don't understand why people hated it.Okay,the language is quite explicit,and it may be shocking to hear it from actors we don't expect to be foul-mouthed in movies(I don't think anyone would have complained about the profanity if Joe Pesci had been in the film),but when you're dealing with such subjects as love,sex and couples being destroyed,and you really want to show their pain or,as in the case of Clive Owen's character,their determination to win the war,sometimes colorful language is necessary.A part from that,this movie is really heartbreaking,as director Mike Nichols (an expert in odd relationship-dramas)and screenwriter Patrick Marber,who also wrote the play this movie is based on,narrate a ""war"" between two couples,who are determined to obtain what they want,no matter what sacrifices might be necessary.Marber's dialogue is gripping and believable,and it does actually provide some laughs (the highlight is the on line-sex between Jude Law and Clive Owen),although the movie is actually a great tragedy.The script is also complex,as it moves from month to month and year to year and almost never fills the gaps(you have to listen to the characters in order to understand what happened).As for the actors,Jude Law and Julia Roberts are very good,but they're hugely overshadowed by Natalie Portman,who is really impressive as a stripper who actually only wants to be loved,and Clive Owen,quite simply OUTSTANDING as merciless dermatologist Larry.Not even his portrayal of Dwight McCarthy (from Sin City) can match the energy,passion and rage(or brutality)he displays in this incredibly compelling film,strangely overlooked by some critics and by the Academy.This movie is one of the best of 2004 and also an excellent choice for those who don't like big-budget,effects-heavy films.Not recommended if you believe in happy endings.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Mike Nichols returns to awkward relationships,"Mike Nichols had been directing plays on Broadway - and had made a comedy album with Elaine May - when he made his big screen directorial debut with ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?"", about an unhappy marriage. He followed it up with ""The Graduate"", which worked like a karate chop on the image of adulthood that the baby boom generation had gotten fed for two decades. Following the anti-war comedy ""Catch-22"", Nichols directed ""Carnal Knowledge"", about screwed-up sexuality.In 2004, Nichols returned to the topic of relationships with ""Closer"". This look at the interactions of four people may seem like a romcom, but it quickly turns out to be quite the opposite. All manner of unpleasant things come about, smoothly portrayed by Nichols's expert direction, and the fine performances from Julia Roberts, Jude Law, Natalie Portman and Clive Owen (the latter two nominated for Academy Awards for their roles).It wasn't 2004's best movie by any measure, but the plot's and characters' complexity make it one that you should see.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

This was shockingly, almost brutal in its unflinchingly realistic portrayal of the behind-closed-doors machinations of four individuals who are in and out of lust and love with one another. They are neither traditional movie heroes or villains. Just people. They are flawed, selfish, confused. Just like people are.Not a previous fan of Roberts, I was delighted to hear America's sweetheart(as well as the other performers) spew such filthily real dialogue. Her revelation scene with Owen is very memorable.No pat Hollywood happy ending here. This is no ""date"" or ""feel-good"" movie. It stays true to the source material, a British play.Many memorable lines of dialogue: shocking, thought provoking, thoughtfully humorous,cutting and caustic.So glad to see a film that really looks at relationships in a real way, like ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" did, although this may seem a bit harsher in tone.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Simple look into the complication that is love,"This is a nice little movie, if you're in the right mood for it. It's a pretty simplistic approach into the act of falling in love, out of love and everything in between. The four main characters weave in and out of each other's lives.I'm sure it's easy for a few out there to recognize themselves in this movie. Each character goes through the cycle from victim to aggressor in some form of another.And for those who don't relate, they probably didn't enjoy the movie as much. The narrow viewer-ship and the simplicity of the script is the only notch I'm taking out for the rating of this movie.If you can figure out that ultimately the movie is about lies, then everyone can relate to that. In the end, one of the characters takes you to the end of their journey, and you kind of feel like the movie lied to you - so you really get to relate. But if you're not into that kind of thing, perhaps the movie will have you feel a little raw.Very good acting and a nice little movie - if you like the genre.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
"For fans of ""XX/XY,"" ""Threesome,"" and even ""True Romance.""","Well, here's the movie that every man wanted to see because Natalie Portman was supposed to be nude in it, however unbelievable that very idea may seem. Well, she again plays a seemingly innocent sweetheart, although she is a stripper. But this movie is a lot more than that, and thankfully, is actually pretty deep.The story revolves, quite simply, around four individualstwo American women and two British menwho spend five years revolving around each other creating four distinct little relationships and a helluva lot of personal confusion and drama. The ideas of sex and relationships seem like games to two characters, while the other two seem like pawns in the game. However, this role is reversed at least once per character. Like the now classic ""American Beauty,"" each character is individually explored, and a large amount of depth is shown. Four very distinct personalities appear, and seeing how they interact is entertaining and believable. Overall, it plays a bit like a parable with punishing moments following the many apparently foolish decisions. This is also a first (at least for me), as I've never seen Julia Roberts portray such a sexually conflicted individualon top of which, the film creates a clear mental image of her performing oral sex.The Good:--The writingmany conversations are quick and to the point, but very witty.--The direction.--The actingexcellent with very believable characters.--The humor and drama all appear in equal and comfortable doses, and lets us get to know the characters.--The depth of the individual characters.Didn't Hurt It, Didn't Help It:--Good atmosphere & music.--Good cinematography, the movie, like ""Lost in Translation,"" really feels at times like an independent film.The Bad:--Nothing really, although, as deep as the characters are, at times it seems none of them are what would be called: ""likable.""The Ugly:--Is this the end of Natalie Portman's innocence?

Closer is just that.It seems like this movie is trying to present a realistic view of the dark side of romance and sex. To me, incessantly asking questions of your partner is not realistic. A large portion of the film consisted of the men asking the women (and sometimes vice versa): What did you do? When did you do it? How did you do it? Where did you do it? After the first hundred questions I didn't care what the answer was, I just wanted these people to shut up already. I on the other hand have just one question: Is this the way real people talk to each other?In addition these are four of the most unlikeable people I've ever seen in a movie.

Two of them Clive Owen and Natalie Portman were rewarded with Golden Globe wins and Oscar nominations. The hype was in place and my expectations were high. After seeing the film, i believe it was one the best in 2004. Director Mike Nichols gets good performances by everyone involved and the storyline about different aspects in relationships, emotions, sex, and people is what keeps people intrigued. Very surprised by Julia Roberts performance, it was a revelation to me. But the star of the movie was Natalie Portman and her characters wide range of emotion and actions. The DVD contains only the music video for the film and previews for other movies so that is a little disappointing but over all if you are looking for an adult film about relationships this would be an intriguing rental.Grade: B+",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Despressing but fascinating,"Grim look at two relationships and how they interact and change over the course of a few years. There's Dan (Jude Law) who seems to love young Alice (Natalie Portman). He also seems to love Anna (Julia Roberts) but she ends up with Larry (Clive Owen).A lot of people seem to hate this film a lot...probably because it's way too realistic. It's grim and has no comedy or light moments at all. The entire cast consists of those four actors--there's no small supporting roles at all. It was (pretty obviously) based on a play and sometimes sounds like a play. Some of the characters make speeches instead of talking to each other. Still I love this film. It's beautifully directed and has some very sharp but truthful observations about love, life and relationships. Almost the entire cast is excellent. Owen and Portman are easily the best actors here. Every line they say rings true. They also share a VERY sexually explicit (in terms of dialogue) sequence that is painful to watch but necessary for the film. Law is just OK in his role. He's not bad but he's not up to Owen and Portman. Roberts unfortunately is pretty terrible. She always has this blank look on her face and is unemotional to a ridiculous degree. Still, her aside, I recommend this film and find it one of the most truthful films I've ever seen on relationships. However be warned--it has VERY sexually graphic dialogue and is not a fun film to watch.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Loved it,"This movie flowed very nicely i didn't mind the flashbacks although towards the end the movie seam to get a little erratic and a little confusing,left me wondering what the message was, seamed they were running out of time and wanted to finish the movie towards the end, overall a great movie. All the performances were great.I had not seen Clive Owen before he did an excellent job a star of the future. This movie is well worth watching. Definitely makes you wonder about who is doing what in your your life. and nothing is always as it seams especially in this movie. Jude law puts in a steller performance and and Julia Roberts although seaming somewhat restrained.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Almost Fantastic,"Closer was a movie that had a screenplay designed for novels and plays, but never have I seen such bold discussion on the silver screen. All four characters have their goods and bads (mostly bads), so there is no hero and there is no villain. Everybody is just out to screw everybody else-literally and figuratively. Nichols cleverly decided that the movie would be strictly dialog and although sex is mentioned in virtually every scene, not once do we get to see the act itself putting all of the weight on the wonderful text. all four members of the cast did fantastic jobs, but Clive Owen is the one that breaks through here and puts himself on the best supporting actor market. the film did have its flaws. sometimes it got too deep, and there were moments where the dialog was forced, but these moments are quickly forgotten with the next scene. you have to go into this movie with the expectation that love becomes the awful four-letter word and sex is its tool or its vice. Don't recommend this movie on a first date. Don't bring the kids to this one. Many adults can't even handle this movie.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Deeply Depressing,"The characters in Closer could never be truly happy unless they were miserable. All of the relationships which we see as love are about passion. Intimacy is a lie. With these four good looking but deeply troubled characters brought together by some cruel fate, it was impossible to get close to someone else without hurting them. Superbly acted especially on the part of Clive Owen in his big breakout as the grief-stricken husband and dermatologist Larry. All of the actors were in their element and made this movie beautiful in a gloomy sort of way. Kudos to Patrick Marber for an excellent screenplay and a beautiful way of depicting hopelessness and angst. This movie can make people think and examine the honesty in their own relationships.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
What The F,"This movie is so confusing and not even good. Acting is okay but the plot is terrible. Not only is there no point to the whole movie, the soundtrack isn't great.

So overrated.",2.0,Anonymous,Romance
Why are people coming down so hard on it?,"I went to see Closer with two of my friends and both of them said they hated it cause it was too depressing, which was the whole point of the movie. People are really bashing this movie cause it's about sex, betrayal and other stuff that's not exactly moral. But the movie isn't preaching morals to anyone nor is it saying that adultery is OK. In the film, adultery is portrayed as something that comes with severe consequences and certainly doesn't promote anything- it's just depicting one situation in which these themes are involved.The acting is great all around, especially Natalie Portman (I almost forgave the Star Wars movies) and Clive Owen (I almost forgave King Arthur). Julia is OK- she's never been my favorite but she's decent here. Saying this as a fan of Jude Law, I think his performance here is completely overshadowed by Owen and Portman. It's still good but not as good as we've seen him before (primarily Talented Mr. Ripley and Road to Perdition). He seems to do so much better in supporting roles for whatever reason.",,Anonymous,Romance
Beware: Closer is a profoundly unromantic rom-com,"If you walk in knowing the above, I think you will find this movie less disappointing than I did. But my wife and I saw this with mostly a kind of easy-going rom-com expectation--not exactly easy-going I must say or even a traditional expectation given this is a Mike Nichols' film--but we were so wrong.The word ""romantic"" is of course a profound lie, and the situations/motifs supported and nurtured for decades even centuries of human civilization do not tell you about the ugly side of love and relationships. That love could be fickle, that we are human beings and ultimately don't really know what we want.This movie feels more like literature than film actually--hence the relatively low score--because what would make a great contemplative meditation on the theme of love has dubious merit as a film featuring some of the most photogenic people out there merely to drive home a philosophical point. ""No matter how we look, we humans are still sh** at love and relationships."" It made think of Graham Greene's beautiful novel, The End of the Affair--in real life relationships are often ugly, I know that, I have lived that.The movie well acted, the cinematography is great, and even the script crackles. But by up-ending our easy expectations this one does a great disservice to all the millions of couples out there who DO get that love begins when we transcend our own selfish considerations. The characters here are all exemplify the worst aspects of ourselves--yes I think 90% of the time humans do fall into the dangerous tropes depicted here honestly--but it's an ugly sight. We come to the movies to escape a bit, but this has too much of that dose of reality.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Writers Who Think Love Is Pain,"The writers of ""The Closer"" seem to think love is pain. And in some situations, they might be right.Dan (Jude Law) can't decide between his women--Alice the simple waitress (Natalie Portman) who is a bit of a muse, versus Anna, the high tone photographer (Julia Roberts)Then there's Larry the doctor (Clive Owen) who also has Anna's interest. And possibly in some ways also Dan's.The plot gets incredibly complicated, maybe overly complicated. But basically for most of the film: Anna overthinks. Larry is a brute. Dan is in a spiral.Alice is clinging and forgiving until, oops, she so definitely is not. (Sorry, I cheered when she went solo and dumped that fool.)The purpose seems to be to break the characters down for viewers to know every piece of them.I wouldn't call this a love story, even for adults.It's more a study of humanity and how people feel when they let down their guards.As such, I won't harp too much on plot but focus on character work, which was perfect. Then again, what else would you expect from the cast.Kudos to the videography and editing. Directing was (*chef's kiss*)

"love, sex, fight, swear, strip....","I'm sure this film is gonna win the Oscar for best screenplay. Why? Cause every other word of dialogue is ""fawk this"" or "" fawk that"". Academy voters admire profanity in films. Proof? Other films that won the writing Oscar, like Pulp Fiction and Good Will Hunting, had 70%profane dialogue .The plot?? Four pretentious people meet each other by accident, interact, fight, fall in love, fall out of love, cry like babies, fight somemore, and disply urbane wit by cussing each other out. All the while classical music, mawkish guitar, and New Wave music plays on the soundtrack.However, worth the price of admission alone, is Natalie Portman's stunning scene with Clive in the strip club.

i can't take my mind off of you...,"Upon first viewing of this film, I wasn't a huge believer. I thought that Clive Owen deserved every accolade that was handed to him. His performance was breathtaking and so full of life that his character was the one to watch for when each scene began. He epitomized the level of good guy and bad guy all into one. So, I was happy with his performance. I was excited to see him playing well with others, but was this a great film? At first, as I said before, I didn't think so, but then I thought about it. This is one of those films that requires you to take a breath and think about the effects long after the final credits have finished rolling. It takes your current relationship and places it right before your eyes. This film will speak to anyone that has been in a relationship or is currently in one. After watching it, you will think about your relationship and the horror will settle in. This film will speak to you, it did me, and it really put into perspective the world of dating and relationships in this modern culture. Nichols has crafted a masterpiece, and while it may not be appreciated as much now, it will remain in our society for a very long time.I have spoken briefly about the acting, but I would like to say that without a decent crew, this film could not have been as emotional as it was. Julia Roberts turns in a performance that is very unlike her and will disappoint those who are die-hard fans, Natalie Portman proves that she is more than just Star Wars material, and Clive Owen  Oh, Mr. Owen  there could be nobody greater. He controls this film and really takes his career into a new level. I am not ashamed to say this, but I am a huge Clive Owen fan. He does not disappoint in this film. Then there is the snivelly Jude Law. I must say, his performance in this film was the least impressive. He somehow finds himself falling into very similar roles in each film that he picks up. If you have seen Alfie, then you have seen a bit of him in Closer and vise versa. He just isn't as great as he was when he first burst onto the cinematic scene. Perhaps it is because he is wearing thin and cannot create fresh characters  I dunno  but whatever it is, he did not provide anything worth-wile to this film.So, with the acting strongly in place (sans Law), Nichols tips off the iceberg with some unprecedented cinematography that allows strong storytelling to take place. One of the biggest elements to this film that captured my attention was Nichols ability to allow time to pass with the greatest of ease. I thought at first that this film was going to happen within the course of a couple of days, but he builds a sense of a strong relationship by allowing it to pass over the course of several years. You really get this feeling that these characters are together for a certain period of time and that development is occurring. I never felt as if something suddenly happened, over the course of four years these acts of the heart take a form of their own through the watchful eye of Nichols. It impressed me. Also, Nichols' use of bold white coloring not only expressed the light of relationships, but also brought out the brilliance of each scene. You became focused on certain elements, the purity of the heart, and so forth. It was cinematic history in the making.Finally, I would like to say that this film was nothing of what I expected. Natalie Portman's final scenes were riveting and really brought the rest of this film together. Scenes in this film happened for a reason instead of just a chance to impress the audiences. It was a delight to finally see a movie that came directly from the heart as well as shot to your heart. It will invoke fear and make you appreciate the relationship that you have. I have never experienced a film quite like this before and cannot wait to see what the brilliant mind of Mr. Mike Nichols will bring next to comment about our society and culture. He does have his hand on the pulse of our lives, and Closer proves it.Overall, I was extremely impressed with this film. I have always been impressed with the work of Mike Nichols' work ever since I first experienced The Graduate and this film was no different. He has this amazing ability of building tension and love together in the same bundle. I remember feeling similar emotions during Closer as I did while watching The Graduate. It is this ability to pull at your heartstrings while still maintaining that sense of realism. I could connect to some portion of this film, and I loved it. I strongly recommend this film, but do not take your gut reaction as the first response. Think about this film, think about yourselves, and then make your decision. It is what I did and somehow this film still remains in my mind weeks after viewing it. I am impressed.Grade: **** out of *****",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Finally, a dramatic movie for adults!","After seeing scores of so-called R-rated movies that seemed more targeted to teenagers than adults, I really appreciated the refreshing change of ""Closer."" This layered, subtle, sexy drama demonstrated the tangled web woven by men and women in relationships, without being the least bit soapy or melodramatic. This is attributable, I think, to the impressive cast of actors in the movie. They did an excellent job of portraying the multi-dimensional, real, and flawed characters in ""Closer."" Julia Roberts pushed the acting envelope in this movie showing that, while she may still be one of ""America's sweethearts,"" she is up to the task of playing in imperfect woman with a dark side. Clive Owen--with his brooding good looks and intense acting style--was perfectly cast in this movie. Natalie Portman displayed an acting sophistication far beyond her years, capturing her the dueling aspects of her character: the lost little girl vs. the woman who wears her sexuality like a mask to avoid true intimacy. If you're looking for a solid drama with the plot/character development and maturity to captivate an adult audience, then ""Closer"" is your movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Self-sure Misfire,"This film has been continuously praised as being 'adult' and 'realistic'. Firstly I might point out that the demographic breakdown on this site of viewer's ratings for this film shows that whilst the average rating overall is 7.4, amongst under 18s it is 8.1 and this figure gradually goes down with each successive age group so that over 45s give it an average rating of 6.8. Not perhaps the breakdown one would expect from such an adult film.Of course the above does suggest that people by and large like this. This mystifies me and I can only think that perhaps people want to like it precisely so they can think of themselves as more mature, adult and realistic for doing so - a feeling typically stronger in under-18s with a maturity-related inferiority complex and less prevalent in people who few would suggest are immature - over 45s. Whatever the case, my own thoughts on the film are this: If this is realistic then happiness must be damned near impossible to achieve. Indeed this movie depicts such despicable characters so consistently doing despicable things that each plot twist becomes utterly predictable once the film is about 1/3 through. A viewer can count on things turning out for the worst in every situation that arises and sure enough this is what happens.It is an empty, barren and depressing film. As far as I recall the four main characters were the sum total of all the speaking parts in the movie, something I believe was primarily responsible for the aforesaid barren feeling that pervaded everything. The movie also has an unfortunate tendency to leap suddenly months or years in advance without any particular warning and in the end this, rather than giving an entertaining survey of the characters' severely dysfunctional lives, instead gives a viewer the feeling of watching a horrendously prolonged montage. The rushed pace with which it moves along, the inhuman coldness of the characters in their dealings with another and the consequent impossibility of actually engaging with them or sympathising with them leave the viewer not really caring what happens to them. Certainly one begins to know whatever it is it will be bad anyway. In short: there's no particular point to watching the film at all.Now it does have a few (very few) redeeming features. Firstly Clive Owen is perhaps the best here and is the only character one might feel vaguely tempted to care about, though even he is required to work from this script and thus is required to try his absolute hardest to be unpleasant. His delivery of the much-quoted line regarding the human heart is perhaps the single finest point in the movie, and really, when you get down to it, the seconds it takes to deliver aren't really worth sitting through this dark, grey blur for.Julia Roberts is utterly cold and flat and not remotely interesting. Natalie Portman plays a character that is interesting in the opening scenes, but as cold and cruel as is to be expected from this movie shortly after. Jude Law plays Jude Law to begin with before sinking into the same icy, vindictiveness of every other character. Indeed, in truth, there's really only one character in the movie, played by four different actors.In its efforts to appear realistic and avoid the usual Hollywood happy, overly-optimistic view on human relationships this film viciously veers in the opposite direction, presenting an unhappy, overly-pessimistic view on human relationships. In other words, it's unrealistically negative. The ways in which the characters so rapidly turn on one another is beyond a normal human and ventures into the realm of the psychopathic.This movie does contain one meaningful exchange, however, between Clive Owen's and Natalie Portman's characters in which Portman states, with regards to a photography exhibition: ""It's a bunch of sad strangers, photographed beautifully and all the glittering assholes who appreciate art say it's beautiful because that's what they want to see."" The irony is, I'm sure she's actually talking about the film.",3.0,Anonymous,Romance
Remarkable.  Raw and True.,"Two pivotal ideas make this film memorable: Clever euphemisms and (conceptually) 'the moment' of change. When exactly does someone fall in love? How does someone? Euphemisms weave their way throughout the dialog, tossing four people ragged on the seas of love without dramamine, to discover The Moment. Closer  the title itself  is euphemistically used to help me understand the moment in the games people play en route to falling into and out of love.Nothing is held back. No bridling. Passion and emotional turmoil are served up raw. That Natalie Portman and Julia Roberts are the female objets'desire drew me in from frame one (and there's Jude Law and Clive Owen for the ladies - no worries).Unless ice water flows through your veins, you'll get Closer to the work of Mike Nichols - who started down this path with Who's Afraid of Virginia Wolff four decades ago, his first and best gem.Enjoy!

'Closer' to perfection at any aspect of it,"I just had to review this movie. I was firstly attracted to the movie itself, because of Jude Law, who stars in and since i'm a huge fan of him individually and his acting, i wanted to get a picture of it.
For the most part, this isn't a movie that talks about romance and fairytales. Talks about ANY aspect of love and most specifically relationships.
Starting off, it really gets across a very 'shady' and 'grown up' feeling of what it is to be in a relationship.
I've never seen a more 'mature' film, which contains so many emotions and character backround. The characters are surrounded by recklessness and drive to act without thinking what they actually do and how their actions are gonna affect their life.
I can't deny the existence of much profanity and stuff like that, but that's what distinguishes being part in a toxic relationship.
With that being that, i was amazingly stunned by everyone's performances! Again, Jude Law was fantastically great at portraying a guy, who can't decide with which woman to live with. Similarly, just because i got to know that Cate Blancett was also nominated for the same award, as Natalie, i think that Natalie should've won it instead, because her performance as Alice/Jane was literally amazing. Furthermore, i also think that Julia Roberts and Clive Owen did an equal great job.
Highly recommended!",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
A resounding success on all fronts,"Based on a stage play by Patrick Marber, Closer tells the story of four people living in the upper crust of London society. All of these characters are flawed to an extent that it is the flaws themselves that make up their personalities, and that makes it very hard to really care for any of them. This is made up, however, by the scene setting. Patrick Marber also wrote the screenplay for this film, and some of his scenes are just brilliant. They're always interesting because of the things that the characters do and say to each other - their motives are well worked out, and even though you don't really like any of them; it's still possible to get behind them because their characters are so well defined and seeing them reveal themselves on screen is always great to watch. The film doesn't really have a plot to speak of, and all the action comes about through the characters themselves rather than any actual plotting. This may be a bad thing for some people, because the film lacks structure - but I liked the way that it panned out because it also makes it unpredictable and, as the characters are the stars anyway, it also ensures that we see them for what they are, as they don't have to follow any plot line.For the characters, Mike Nichols has recruited four big names. Natalie Portman stands out the most among the cast members. This beautiful and talented young actress makes every scene she's in a treat for the eyes, and her beauty does Closer no end of favours in that respect. She has the best scene in the movie, which is shared by Clive Owen and takes place in a strip club! It's been years since Julia Roberts made anything worth seeing, and for that reason; she's the sore thumb of this cast of up and coming young stars. The male leads give strong performances, and Clive Owen in particular stands out. He's a very strong actor and that translates well to his character. Similarly, Jude Law's screen presence suits his character excellently but in a different way. Mike Nichols has his first big success with an adaptation of a stage play with the brilliant ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?"", and although this film doesn't come close to the brilliance of that one, the great director has managed to inject just the right tone into the proceedings and it is that which ultimately makes Closer the success that it is.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
love is a collision course,"Closer starts rather gently with a romantic song ringing ever so delicately as two characters approach each other, amidst the crowded streets of London. Then something happens, something injures. That's the story Closer is trying to tell. Two relationships sail smoothly across time, then something happens. Dan and Alice meet through an accident she sustains during a collision course with an automobile. They share information about their lives, jobs and romantic history. He shares more than her. He doesn't notice this, perhaps because all men are secretly into themselves. They visit places, a clinic, a memorial park, his destination. He almost leaves no mark but because he's taken with her, he leaves his name and she gives him hers. And they live happily ever after. Then something happens. He's written a book. Anna is shooting his portrait for the book's back cover. She's read the literature. She says she likes it. She's lying. She doesn't really like the book. You can see it in her eyes. He cannot though and when she tells him that she loves the book, he's flattered. He's attracted to the woman with a sad air, a secretive stare. He offers a kiss. She measures his intentions, his face, his game. She accepts the kiss. For a moment, she sees her life with him, yes, happily ever after. Then something happens.Love is an accident, the film wants to say. Or is it love is a lie? Or is it secrets are lies. Or does it ask the viewer to choose, secrets or lies? The four characters in Closer are in a conundrum. They cannot choose between the two slippery choices. They think there's more in the menu. They choose secrets, the sneaking suspicion eats at them. They choose lies, truth knocks them in the head. They don't know. They can't see.Closer plays like an antidote to the charming poison of the usual Hollywood romantic comedies or even the year's incisive but more hopeful offering, Before Sunset. It's a cautionary tale. The words are weapons, they're also the advice. This what you shouldn't say. This is what you should say. To salvage a relationship, to end another, what action is safer to take?This is a wordy movie, relentlessly talky and heavy. Scenes extend because it wants to capture real time at parts. Monologues are avoided. The dialogue is clipped, sound and sudden. And they are delivered with venom.The actors take center stage. Natalie Portman portrays Alice. She looks way too precious but she delivers her lines the way she should, with heart. Jude Law is Dan. He gives the character a knotted edge, as if on the verge of a solution but still blocked by a dead end. He's a pleasure to watch. Clive Owen is Larry. He's the alpha male, a scary figure, also the most humanly defensive. And of course, Julia Roberts is Anna. Guarded, docile in nature and the eventual prisoner. Julia portrays her character, devouring the entirety of Anna without fear. She gamely takes on her rotten first strike capability, her lockstep desires and loneliness with thespian magic. She proves us all right. She can do everything.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Not close enough,"Vicous, mean-spirited movie about four people falling in and out of lust with each other, cheating on each other, and hurting each other. The characters throw cynical one-liners back and forth at each other throughout, but they never seem as if they're smart enough to speak this way. The only one who rises above this is Clive Owen who is the best thing in the film and steals every scene he's in. Very unlikable, but strangely addicting if only to find out what becomes of these bad people. No real insight, just a dirty, vulgar film that happens to be pretty pleasing to the eye. Sadly, the opening scene is the best scene in the film - and wouldn't you know; it's a nice, sweet scene.**1/2 out of ****",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

"Superficial and contrived plot, improbable situations and too many high profile actors in one flick.","I was extremely disappointed and irritated by this film. Movies should be about being transported into the lives and situations of the people on the screen but that singularly failed to happen in the case of 'Closer'.The characters and relationships definitely do not ring true at all. It's not a question of not liking the people depicted, though none are likable, especially not the irritating doctor character. It's not a question of finding some of the language shocking - it is no more shocking than you'd see in a TV drama and there is virtually no nudity or sex. It's just that you couldn't care less about the characters as you don't really get to know them. Each one has no feeling of reality, no subtlety and no authenticity. They do things people only do in films, not in real life.Do doctors really sit and engage in chat room sex talk in a hospital back office before going into the theatre to do an operation? Would photographer Anna have talked to and befriended sleazy doctor Larry in the aquarium... and then married him? Do people really hitch, split, re-hitch, bitch, bawl and spit at each other over who's been doing it with whomsoever's extramarital lover - or just ex, and is not telling the truth? Truthfulness toreal life is something this story lacks completely.I found the dialogue wooden, the words contrived, the performances staged. Maybe it works better as a play. If so then it has not transferred successfully to film. I found it suffocating to have so many high profile actors together.You know when a movie isn't working when you start to see the script roll in front of you like an autocue, and when you think you can see the crew looking on as the actors work through their lines.After wasting two hours and five pounds on this movie I am losing my confidence in going to the cinema, except to see something I have seen before or has been personally recommended to me.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
Amazing,"I will admit to sitting for some time in my chair after the movie ended with a sense of needing to talk about this movie with my daughter who went to see it with me. Only movies that really move me cause this sensation. I was wiping the tears away and feeling a considerable amount of sadness for these people. The last movie that did that to me was American Beauty. This is one of the best character studies I have seen. Although there was almost nothing in the movie that paralleled my life, I still somehow saw parts of myself in it. Maybe because I know the sadness of the person you love not loving you. Or understanding how hard it is to let someone you care for go. The emotions in this movie were real and the acting superb. Amazing. See it.",,Anonymous,Romance
Good Acting and Writing but the characters are negative personalities,CLOSER is a good film. May have been a better play.

Natalie Portman acts well too and shows off her superb figure.Portman takes on brave roles and is trying to prove her legitimacy as an actress.Jude Law is fine but is so pathetic as a character that it turned me off.

Not for special effects geeks,"Having read a little about this movie beforehand I knew that there was a bit of a contradiction with this movie. Casting my eye over the audience it was clear that the cast (and hype) had attracted a larger audience than you'd normally expect from a character/script driven film. Hopefully the film will convert some of the blockbuster junkies to take a look at a wider range of films.The film focuses entirely on the relationships between the four characters played by Law, Owen, Roberts and Portman. I wasn't entirely convinced by the realism of the Dan and Anna characters played by Law and Roberts. Maybe Portman and Owen lucked out by playing characters with more breadth , but their performances were both excellent.

""If you believe in love at first sight, you never stop looking."" accurately sums up what the characters do in the story. They easily give in to lust, ignoring what they already have and seeking what they can't have or what they haven't got yet. The character Dan desires Anna, even if he is in ""love"" with Alice. At the end of the story, when he finds out that Anna sleeps with Larry, he cannot forgive. When Alice goes back to him, he still minds whether Alice has sex with Larry or not.Like what Alice comments on the art exhibition that it's a lie, love is a beautiful word that is used to deceive themselves and others. When the spell is broken, they become familiar strangers. It's lust, not love.Instead of making up another fairytale, the movie maker deals with what happens in real life. It's pretty thought-provoking. Well-done.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
(c)loser,"First of all, the big debate.. Is this movie supposed to be realistic or not?? I read some of the reviews here and found that, people who liked this movie, presumed it to be unrealistic and went on extolling the artsy story and witty screenplay. I found the story to be utter crap, although the screenplay, or most importantly the dialogues were extremely witty, it was the premises of this movie that left a bad taste in my mouth. My question is - Are we supposed to feel sorry for the four idiots who go on making mistakes in their love life and fall in and out of each relationship with no sense at all. I personally thought that the movie was supposed to be a realistic effort by the director, but he completely failed at it. The only likable character in the movie is portman's and its a shame to see her falling for Jude law's pathetic character again and again. The same goes for the others(Roberts and Owen). So much so, that it is impossible to empathize with any of the characters at any point. If I wanted to watch a good ""unrealistic"" artsy movie - I would watch Aliens vs Predator instead. This story is just a mockery on emotions, and the praise it receives is mostly a case of Emporers new clothes",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
An admirable stage to screen transfer which demands intelligent attention,"I first saw the outstanding Patrick Marber play, CLOSER, when it was on Broadway (172perf., March 25-Aug. 22, 1999, at the Music Box Theatre with the late Natasha Richardson in the Julia Roberts role following a successful run in London, where the play is set) and was enthralled with the cool cinematic dissection of the come-again-go-again relationship of four people. I liked the play so much that I somehow never got to the excellent film version with a well neigh perfect cast until recently on DVD.Coming back to the piece a decade later, in a version which director Mike Nichols, working from the playwright's own screenplay, somewhat Bowdlerized (he eliminated the death of one character who now merely goes abroad and actually improved the opening of the Second Act in the Strip Club by reducing the ""ick factor"") in the vain hope of warming the piece for a broader audience, I am struck again with what a superb, un-sappy, universal examination it is of the motivations and mistakes which plague and bless interpersonal relationships. Many people will find this unromantic and cynical, but only if they are unprepared to accept how close the characters come to themselves or people they know in spirit if not in detail. People who thought the Prince/Sondheim/Furth musical COMPANY was somehow an attack on marriage rather than a statement of how essential ""coupling"" is to the human condition will simply not ""get"" this film.Structurally, Marber still gives us a brilliant flow jumping back and forth in time and occasionally playing mirroring scenes overlapping each other. Under the earlier playwright's heavy influence, this is probably the best play Harold Pinter never wrote - improving on the master in Marber's clarity of vision and gift for real dialogue. All too often when a stage production glories in a ""cinematic"" approach, it is screwed up when it comes to the screen by a director who feels he must impose his own concept on the piece. CLOSER was blessed with the choice of Mike Nichols - a director who was sufficiently self assured not to have to worry about calling attention to himself, but merely serving the best in Marber's story.The performances Nichols gets - from Julia Roberts as Anna the artist (unfairly criticized in some circles for precisely the emotionally inhibited quality which makes it real), Jude Law as Dan the striving author / obituary editor, Natalie Portman* (in the only fully professional performance I have ever seen from her - the director really does make a difference; witness her cheap scenery chewing in BLACK SWAN this year regardless of award nominations it may bring her) as Alice the damaged free spirit and the darkly sensuous and painfully insecure Clive Owen* as Larry the sex addict who finally finds a love he needs - are all as close to perfection as any audience could ask. (* = well deserved Oscar Nominations and Golden Globe AWARDS in ""Support"")Although all of those involved have had bigger commercial hits, seldom have any of them done better actual work. CLOSER is not a film for the shallow or those who want fast, easy laughs or pat romantic solutions, but for an adult audience willing to engage their minds and pay attention, it's one of the great ones.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Engaging performances by a powerhouse cast make for a very interesting film,"'Closer' plays as a sequence of incidents in the lives of four main characters with passage of differing lengths of time between each scene so that to a certain extent, the audience has to fill in the gaps.The film opens with a shot on a busy street where Dan (Jude Law) and Alice (Natalie Portman) are walking towards each other to a soundtrack of Damien Rice's 'The Blower's Daughter' (I loved this track the instant I heard it and it suits the opening and end scenes so well). There is a spark as Dan and Alice catch each other's eye but before introductions are made, Alice is knocked down by a taxi and Dan accompanies her to the hospital. At this point in time, we learn that Dan is an obituary writer. Later, we find out that he has used Alice's life as the subject of his novel. He meets Anna (Julia Roberts) who photographs him and they end up kissing. As a result of a prank Dan plays when chatting to Larry (Clive Owen) on an Internet chat room, Larry meets Anna at the London Aquarium.At times, the film protrudes the intensity of a theatre production which is little surprise as 'Closer' is an adaptation of a Patrick Marber play. All four leads play on the whole, unsympathetic characters but are no less interesting because of it. Natalie Portman even plays against type as a stripper. At times, the film is darkly funny and I would not recommend this film if explicit dialogue offends you.This is a love story that is different from the norm and deals effectively with the issue of deception and how it impacts on the lives of the central characters.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
A razor sharp look at relationships,"Closer is about the key wrong move you can make in an intimate relationship.The good. Nice music and score. Beautiful photography. Solid characters with great depth. Excellent scenario construction which tells a long story in a very short time while making us understand what really makes or breaks a relationship. It mostly follows chronology or otherwise makes it easy to understand, but never shows any time stamp. That makes the viewer's mind work and thus plunges us into the story rather quickly, a fascinating tale of change and turnabout.The actors. Natalie Portman gives a great performance, and shows her talent with a complex yet subtle role. Clive Owen as the clever bastard definitively gave the performance of a lifetime, it's by far his best one. Jude Law as the neurotic romantic indecisive love lorn control freak certainly gave us one of his best. Julia Roberts gave a nice performance, but it just not on par with the others.The bad.

Searching for authentic love,"A romantic drama that explores the complexities of relationships. Clive Owen shares the screen with Jude Law, Julia Roberts, and Natalie Portman in a film that's both thought-provoking and emotionally charged. Owen plays Dan, a photographer whose relationship with Alice (played by Natalie Portman) is on the rocks. He's a bit of a ladies' man, but deep down, he's searching for connection and authenticity in love.Owen brings a depth and nuance to the role, making Dan a relatable and sympathetic character. He has great chemistry with Portman, and their scenes together are some of the most poignant in the film. The plot unfolds as we're introduced to Dan's friends and acquaintances - particularly Larry (played by Jude Law) and Anna (played by Julia Roberts). As their relationships intersect and collide, we're taken on a journey of love, desire, and heartbreak. The film's direction by Mike Nichols is masterful, capturing the complexities of human emotions with a deft touch. The screenplay, adapted from Michael Cunningham's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel, is witty, insightful, and full of clever observations about love and relationships.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Very Depressing!,"I didn't find this movie raw, shocking, or very explicit in the way it handles relationships and sex... I did find it extremely boring with very few redeeming qualities at all, i found it very hard to sit in the cinema and watch this to the end but only because it bored me to tears! Mike Nichols as a director can normally be relied on to bring real human emotion to even the most depressing subjects, try renting any other film he has ever directed...as this is his worst so far by a very long way! If the comments made by most of the rest of the audience on the way out the cinema, no matter how much publicity this film gets word of mouth by the paying audience should make sure this movie does not have a long run in UK cinemas...although i found the 101mins is 101mins too long!",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
Closer,"This movie is not that special, but I liked it. It's all about 4 people who at first have nothing to do with each other, but they all meet each other during the film. It's a bit confusing because the movie jumps in time a lot. From one scene to another, suddenly a year has passed. That wasn't a good idea for the film, I think. The actors played good and convincing, but I didn't care so much for some of the dialogs, because they were a bit exaggerated. But other dialogs were touching and made you think about it. The end was a bit surprising, when you hear Alice's real name which she said earlier in the movie. The film is rather depressing and I would recommend to people with pangs of love not to go and see it. So, my general vision of this movie is that it is good, but nothing more.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
not bad...,"I think the history is not very well built and results too much absurd. Despite that, actors work is really good, and, from my point of view, that saves the quality of the film. The story advances in a strange way, with changes in time that are not shown to us until some time later, so usually,it is difficult to understand WHEN it's happening after the end of the scene. In addition, the characters claim to believe in love and loyalty, but they don't think in nothing more than sex, sex and sex. The director has not done a good work, nor the writer, on the other hand, actors made a great part, (specially both men, including one nomination to the Oscar's), actor's work is, by far, the best part of the film, if they were not so good, film would be too much bad. It is not strange that is well marked by kids, because they only catch the sex part so they are pleased, but it is usual that they don't catch the complicated personality of the characters and why they do those things, so it is not strange, also, that older people, more used to think about it, think that is a worse film. a 6, it's not bad, neither good.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Natalie Portman Deserved an Oscar,The range and depth of Natalie Portman in this film is amazing. The other three performances shouldn't be ignored but Portman stands out. Mike Nichols has created another masterpiece. As a reference point I recommend you watch Mike Nichol's Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolfe? and Carnal Knowledge. Both about relationships and are structured similarly. Jude Law was very over looked for this film. Notice the change in his character which is subtle and you will appreciate his performance. It's all in the dialog and the subtext so pay attention and you'll find interesting character points. Has a French New Wave feel along with great photography and composition by Mike Nichols. Enjoy!,8.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Pretentious, ridiculous, but saved (kind of) by the actors and photography.","Prior of seeing this movie I had heard every review and adjective possible about Closer. Erotic, realistic, challenging, smart, dumb, boring, exhilarating (however you spell it...), masterful or just plain beautiful. I watched the movie deciding to judge for myself, not knowing what to expect.Closer is one of those many movies when after it has only just begun you think ""not another classic love story."" Sure enough there's the awaited love-at-first-sight sequence, between to beautiful people in the middle of a great big city full of strangers. But thankfully, it stops there, because we might accuse Closer of being many things, but it's neither unoriginal or boring.I had only seen Primary Colors (excellent, especially Travolta) and Working Girl (not so excellent) from Mike Nichols before, and it was a surprise to see such an excellent photography, camera movement and just visual pleasure with so much simplicity. Continuing on the technical success, the actors are brilliant,I didn't imagine Natalie Portman this mature, and Clive Owen is a very pleasant surprise...But that's it, nothing else to see here, because the interesting bit is over, the movie is well made, but there's nothing inside. I've seen people leave after 30 minutes, because apart from the occasional laugh (Owen especially), or the rare quote that speaks the real truth, the actors aren't enough to make us forget that this story is just plain ridiculous.It's a romance for people who have it all wrong, guys who need to go out more, or just sex freaks. Because as much as I like sex, I don't believe perverts like these resemble the true animals inside of us. No, women don't like to be called whores, and facial ejaculation isn't common in every sexual intercourse like Roberts' character claims.The directing is pretentious, it wants to make a glorified ""art"" film from he silliest screenplay ever (Hey guys, lets make an internet sex scene that goes on for 10 minutes). This is intellectual masturbation at it's finest. The screenwriter probably needs to stop dating crazy cum guzzling freaks, because that's the only thing portrayed in this ""romance"", love and sex are mixed in confusion, and we get to see breakups and cheating confessions. And then some more.People claim that this movie is ""so very real"", to those, you either need to finally be in your first relationship, or just stop thinking sex is all that matters in one.To those who like to watch movies just for the acting (like me), this is an interesting one, but please don't expect an ounce of emotion from the story. 7 out of 10 for those who fit in that category, 9 for the ones who need to understand a thing or two about their lives, and 5 for the rest.

Did I miss something?,"And then, perhaps not. First, great cinematography, great locations. Nice to see London as London even if it was always grey.The story-line? It had possibilities - ones I don't believe were fully explored or, rather, could have been explored more fully - as in the games people play.The actors? A serious mismatch. Each on their own may or may not have been good. As a mix - the whole just seemed too two dimensional. The mix lacked critical depth.Might be difficult transforming a successful stage play into a good film. Stage plays essentially depend on dialogue and this, in usual absence of any visual cues or props. Here one listens to the dialogue and becomes involved in all its nuances. This is where the theatre of good theatre lies, in good dialogue and its delivery.In a film, one has dimension. One needs dimension and somehow, for me, Closer lacked that.To appreciate the point I'm trying to make, perhaps some readers here may have seen Alan Rudolph's ""The Moderns"". Now there's a film with dimension. The Moderns is a film not too dissimilar to Closer in many ways. This film is also about relationships. But there was something there that I have rarely ever found in any other film - the subtlety of dialogue - not only of the spoken word but also in its visual delivery. I think this is what I mean by ""dimension"". Closer somehow didn't have that.May be its a generational thing - The Moderns was made nearly 20 years ago. Must have made some impact if it still comes to mind now.That aside, is not that I'm seeking fault with the film. Natalie Portman's performance was sterling. Julia Roberts was Julia Roberts as was Jude Law. Clive Owen was effective.Oh - where this film did lose some credibility for me was where Anna used a Leica (35 mm camera) to take the crying picture of Alice and, in the exhibition, the picture was printed up in a square format with its ragged neg holder borders and all. Wouldn't say this was typical for a ""real photography"" if the intention was to print full neg - what more can I say?",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

The theatre was nearly empty. And then the movie starts. No, this is not one more of those feel-good Julia Roberts flicks. And yes, she still gives us enough of those gorgeous smiles aplenty. Enough to make me happy at least. But that is beyhond the point. In this movie, you see her and 3 other outstanding actors playing the theatre of life on screen. It's not the right movie for a sad day. You'll feel like committing suicide afterwards (or almost). But it is a masterpiece of human behaviour and human relationships. The dialogues are pure, and intentionally harsh. Intentionally real. The characters are intentionally sad and worthy of pity. One thinks: «oh, God, am I also like this? Does this happen in MY life?» That's the shocker. The movie is so real, so CLOSE. Masterful direction, and 4 actors who matured to do a movie with scenes of pure brilliance. A must-see.

The misery of romance,"I guess from this being based on a play, being about two sets of couples, being directed by Mike Nichols, and being quite miserable, it feels sort of like a companion piece to Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf. Closer's certainly not as good as that film (which is absolutely one of Nichols' best), but I thought it was pretty solid overall.Part of me thought the characters were all a bit over-dramatic, considering it feels like they get over their life missteps very quickly (oh, you can't be with one attractive person, but you can be with another attractive person? Poor you x4), but I think it also spans a surprisingly long amount of time, with months passing between many scenes. If this hadn't been suggested, I probably would've really disliked this, or at least found it a great deal more frustrating.As it stands, I think I found it frustrating for reasons that were intended. It's bleak, and not always 100% authentic feeling, but it feels authentic enough for an American mainstream(ish) movie. Much of the film (especially anything involving Clive Owen) felt like Albert Brooks' Modern Romance, but without any of the comedic relief. The only time Closer's kind of funny is during the online chat scene near the start - after that, it's surprisingly bleak stuff, and RIP to any couples back in 2004 who went to see it at the movies for a date night!",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Cinema Literature,"Closer (2004) is the best postmodern art offering to hit the big screen in decades. The best since Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? (1966) and Ingmar Bergman's Scenes From A Marriage (1973). In fact the movie itself echo's the study of troubled marital relationships spoken of in both the art movie classics. It is hard to explain what the exact plot of this story is; crudely putting it, Closer deals with heterosexual relationships and swapping partners. It is an excellent study of adults, made by adults for an adult audience. For once we have a movie, which isn't called an adult movie just by the insert of sex and nudity, for there is none of that. The story is meant for more mature intelligent audiences, which neither would children be able to comprehend, and nor would they find it interesting. Not that it is slow moving, it actually moves quickly, and time passes by with a blink of an eye. It's always swift moving capturing the viewers attention, the dialogue is sleek and fast, not a single boring moment. The viewer's mind would never wander away, as he or she would be so involved with the unique story and it's extra unique characters. The superb cast consists of Jude law, Julia Roberts, Clive Owen and Natalie Portman. The film cannot be imagined with anyone else instead. If another replaced even one of these stars, it might have not been such great a movie. The cast is that perfect. In fact all four-cast members together won in the category for 'Best Acting Ensemble' at the 'Broadcast Film Critics Association Awards'. None of the characters are very nice people one would want to associate with, especially the men. Not that the women are any saints, but the two men portrayed in this movie are out right savage animals. Based on a play by Patrick Marber, Closer, was excellently adapted to the big screen by director Mike Nichols. Interesting Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? (1966), was Nichols directorial debut starring the two best character actors of modern art form of cinema, Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton. Thus we see that both Mike Nichols' directorial debut and his latest offering are two best movies ever released in postmodern artistic cinema genre made in the English language. As most art cinema is affiliated to European ventures, with Sweden's Ingmar Bergman, France's Francois Truffant & Jean-Luc Goddard to Italian Federico Fellinini and many such great European directors. Closer would no doubt be remembered as one best ever made, and the best of the early twenty-first century. This superb piece of art, so believably realistic, will no doubt be taught to students of cinema, not just in film schools, but also as analysis of film literature. And Julia Roberts name is associated with this masterpiece. It is no use writing what the movie is about one must actually watch this. It is unique, and the best all four; Jude Law, Julia Roberts, Natalie Portman and Clive Owen; would have ever appeared in.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Not quite up to the script,"It's so rare that we get to see a film made by adults for adults, that it's a pity to report that Mike Nichols's Closer doesn't quite come up to the very high standards that Patrick Marber sets for it. Marber's screenplay, adapted from his own stage version, is full of verbal sparrings which invite over-playing, and I think Nichols's deliberate attempt to under-emphasise the carnality of what takes place, letting the words work for the actors, so to speak, is what lets the film down. For once, I think that the script could do with more opening up from its theatrical origins, taking the action out of rooms, apartments, studios. The music is also spartan (which I would normally welcome), leaving the dialogue with much to do. The camera work is mostly static and head and shoulder, allowing for the very remorseless examination of the characters' reactions and motives which the script demands, but making for a one-dimensional experience.For such a distraction-free approach to work to succeed in the cinema (the closeups may be softened by smaller screens), performances need to be of the highest order. In this case, though none of the A-list actors by any means let themselves down, their characters' duplicity and self-deception does not transfer from dialogue to action. The only clear motive that we see expressed is for Natalie Portman's character to leave (having had an unambiguous slap from Clive Owen); but earlier, we are asked to believe that Clive will have the hots for Natalie (because he suddenly strokes her face), and that the Julia Roberts character will deceive Clive for Jude Law because they stop talking and start kissing during a photographic session. Oh, and Julia and Clive will get married, but their initial meeting (contrived by Jude, or accidental ?) intimated no such thing.The result, as many people have commented, is that we find it hard to care very much about these four people and their love and sex lives, to the point where the one (love) and the other (sex) become inter-changeable. Tellingly, though the characters repeatedly ask each other to be truthful, demanding not so much faithfulness as full reporting, it's hardly surprising that neither they nor we understand what has happened. Rather than the intended dissection of relationships, we get an intimate but unrewarding closeup of four characters doing things that come of as much a surprise to them as it is to us.It's a pity that four such able actors have been reined in to such an extent. For what might be tantrums and breakdowns we get a series of tautly scripted two- and three-handers, with never so much a spilt glass of wine to break the rhythm. Julia Roberts's performance is better than she usually is allowed to be (how she must long for parts such as this), and Natalie Portman shows just how much potential she has for the more fully developed roles to come. Jude Law is good in a bookish sort of way, but is once more not allowed to (or maybe can't) work over much against his looks. He also needs to stop walking like that (the first time I have noticed how ungainly he is). Clive Owen is a bit of a disappointment, perhaps because his anger and spite, not to mention lust, bangs so hard against the other three.I was not shocked or disgusted by what these fickle four get up to, or say to each other. But I was disappointed that so worthy an attempt to give us a truthful depiction of adult relationships falls into the chasm between exposition and character. For example, did the stage play make use of the Alice/Jane name device, or was this tacked on for the screen ? If so, what was it meant to explain about the Natalie Portman character ? It added nothing that I could see, but maybe I just didn't care enough.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

The performances of the four leads are equally wonderful to such an extent that you are kept at the edge of your seat virtually every moment.

a digestive,"Closer may not be the worst movie ever made. I haven't seen every movie ever made, so I'm not in any position to make that evaluation. I can simply say it is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. It is dull, repetitive, unbelievable, pretentious, sophomoric, and vulgar. Its leaden pace induces narcolepsy even as it desperately tries to titillate with the language of fornication. The ""adults"" in this movie are like the incarnation of the fantasies of a psychologically troubled 15-year old boy: both obsessed by and disgusted with their own sexuality. In one interminably long, dull scene, Jude Law -- impersonating a woman -- has cyber-sex with loutish doctor Clive Owen. The embarrassing part is that Director Mike Nicholas is so out of it that he thinks there is something inherently novel about this all-too-common internet phenomenon and so lets the stale scene play out at a laborious pace somewhere between cosmological entropy and stop-motion-photography. We're left to watch these blandly pornographic proceedings with all the enthusiasm of a half- anesthetized dental patient awaiting the drill.About halfway through this movie a mischievous thought occurred to me: perhaps something more interesting was going on elsewhere on the premises. So I left my seat, retired to the men's room, and, at great leisure, relieved myself of my previously delicious dinner.

Poignant,"The screenplay was beautifully written. The cinematography was lovely as well. My favorite scene was between Clive Owen and Julia Roberts' characters. It is incredibly important that the actors listen to each other during a scene; these two execute this skill with ease. It was interesting to watch Julia Roberts give such a complex character life. I am pleased to hear that Natalie Portman and Clive Owen were given Oscar and Golden Globe nods. The director deserves respect as well, I think. This movie opened my eyes, and many others'. Unfortunately I had to see this in a theater full of disrespectful theater-goers. One should not see this movie in a drunken state.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Easy to respect,tough to like","This film,about the revolving relationships between two couples,is a very heady and strong effort by all involved,but it is tough to feel much sympathy or likability for nearly everyone involved. Julia Roberts' Anna can't seem to be trusted to hold onto a relationship,Jude Law's Dan can't be trusted to do the right thing once in one,Clive Owen's Larry is a thick-headed professional sort who can't seem to decide whether or not he's truly in love with either Annd or Alice,and Natalie Portman's Alice(probably the most sympathetic of the bunch)is so fragile and delicate that she's always on the verge of dropping a relationship at the turn of an emotion.I've read one review that says that this movie is ""as real as it gets"". Really? How many random foursomes of people in a large city(in this case,London)constantly go pin-balling back and forth between each other,regardless of the fact that they are both so cruel to each other in the first place? I would wager that here are very real elements of real life relationships in this movie,but as a whole,the personal dynamics of this film are much more convoluted than what you would ordinarily get in a true life interchange of couples.The acting is strong,and the writing seems better suited for the stage. Certainly not bad enough to give a low rating,but not worth a rave,either.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Closer isn't for everyone,"The beautiful thing about Closer is that you can either love it, or hate it. The people who loved it can relate to one or all of the characters, the story, the situation. The people who hate it still believe that all relationships are the way the romantic comedies portray them- as fluffy fairy tales. Its not a movie for everyone. The beauty in this movie is the dialogue, its gritty, honest, and bare bones. I think that its a honest look at the dark sides of people and what they do to each other in relationships. Its not meant to be funny, exciting, or happy. Its meant to be a no holds barred look at the language we use with each other, about sex, about love, lust, and how we look at ourselves. Each character has their own neuroses, their own glamour, their own mantras. For the people that recognize this movie for what it is, looks at it and can see parts of themselves in each character. We have been that young girl, acting grown up, trying to survive in a world that pays more to see our bodies than cherish our minds. We have been the person who is lost, never seeming to be happy, afraid of what our happiness might bring or the person who loves the hardest, and the person always looking for the next big affair, taking love for granted. Its supposed to make you uncomfortable, its supposed to make you reflect on your own life.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Life in a nutshell,"People are weird. Even if they love someone, they can't help hurting those people and themselves in addition. And the rest is just happening on a pure whim of chance or is simply secondary. And that's it.Seriously, expecting some moral lesson or a message from Closer is like having the same expectations about a Cohen brother film. There simply are none, that's just life. Less ironic as the brothers tend to depict it, but still both bizarre and inexplicably believable. Every single weird action or an illogical conversation is much more realistic than a thousand things we find reasonable. And that's the beauty of this film.It goes a bit over the top at times, purely for the dramatic effect, but that's the only imperfection this film affords itself. Oh, and sliding from light irony to pure intensity towards the climax. It didn't make this film any false, but darkened the mood enough to think that maybe life would be better without certain moments. Although if there's still something remotely resembling a message in this film is that no events are good or bad on their own and the beauty of this world is that even becoming a victim of a nasty prank might be a way to finding true happiness in your life.Nobody knows what will happen to them and to those they love the next moment. And sometimes it's even better not to know: too much truth could be poisonous. So just enjoy being happy fools, because the ignorant bliss is more fragile than you think.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Not bad (for a Nichols' film),"A failed writer, a young stripper, a doctor with a certain prestige, and a very successful photographer. Four characters, four crossed relationships. Sex, love, infidelity, the animal attraction... Well, ""Closer"" is not that original, is it? Cinema has talked about all kind of relationships along the last 100 years. So, the virtues of ""Closer"" are not in the story it tells but in the way Nichols tells it, his last movie is much more foul-mouthed and direct than the rest of his works. Is rather strange to hear Julia Roberts holding a conversation with huge explicitly sexual contents, or to watch strait-laced Natalie Portman moving like an expert stripper.Well, I don't think Mike Nichols is a great director, and I don't specially like none of the actors either, but the movie as a whole is not that bad...

"Intriguing, but too far removed from reality","Mike Nichols' 2004 cinematic comeback ""Closer"" seems to be really poignant at first. The cast is great, the score suits the scenes fine and the dialog is sharp and witty. The problem is, after a while ""Closer"" becomes obviously far removed from reality. Characters start to act real quick-witted and theatrical dialog when in real life they would just walk away from each other in anger. Couples split and then get together for no convincing reason. And if that wasn't enough one character at one point exclaims that she's just fallen out of love in one instant. Just like that. As if anyone would ever say that.The reason why I'm so critical about this lack of total realism is that ""Closer"" seems so much to try to make an universally true statement about love or male-female relationships. In that aspect it doesn't quite deliver and the lines aren't as poignant as the writer wished they'd be.That's more of a fault of the original play, though. The movie, as an adaption of that play, is fine. The cast, as I've said, is consistently great and the scene, in which Clive Owen is fooled into thinking he's having an erotic chat with a girl is one of the funniest and truest things about modern society ever put on screen. ""Closer"" is worth seeing for that alone. Oh, and if you happen to be a heterosexual guy, the chance of seeing Natalie Portman with very, very little on might also be an inducement for watching this movie.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
So bad it bothered me for three days,"Where do I begin? I know. This movie was complete garbage. The acting was mediocre at best, the script appeared to have been written by a 15 year old high school dropout, the movie had no point and worst of all their was no ending. No really there was literally NO ENDING. Someone once said, ""A man without a plan is not a man."" This translates to film making as ""A film without a point is not a film."" That pretty much covers the point that I am so explicitly making. The four characters are supposed to be in love with each other. The writer tries to pound this point home but he forgets one thing. None of the characters have the slightest idea what love is and it is painfully obvious to even the most dimwitted individual. Telling someone ""I love you"" doesn't prove to the audience that they actually feel that way. Yet Jude Law's character tells Julia Robert's character this the first time they meet after 20 minutes together. If you told that to a grown woman the first time you met she would immediately laugh in your face then ask you to leave. I don't care how good looking you are or think you are. I really wonder how this movie got nominated for four Academy Awards but more importantly what possessed these four to sign up for this disastrous bomb? It will not be remembered fondly if remembered at all and a serious film watcher shouldn't watch it once much less twice.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
We Never Stop Looking,"Love, sex, desire, flirting, betrayal are everybody's business. It doesn't matter if you're romantic/faithful, or liberal/promiscuous: you do worry about how you're regarded.The handsome guy (Jude Law) sees the beautiful young lady (Natalie Portman) coming closer, then a car knocks her down. Boy helps girl, boy meets girl. A couple of years pass and we get to know that they've been living together since they met. He is Daniel, an obituary-writer; she is Alice, an American ex-stripper who is working in London as a waitress. Dan is about to launch a book telling Alice's history, and thinks he'll finally succeed as a writer. Alice is happy just for being with Dan and leading her modest job/life.Things start to get dark when Dan meets Anna (Julia Roberts, in which is probably her best performance to date), a beautiful photographer, and they flirt. Playing a prank on a lonely doctor, Larry (Clive Owen) Dan chatted online with (pretending to be a woman), he unexpectedly makes Anna and Larry meet and fall in love with each other. These four strangers will meet, cheat and argue several times, and when we think they've finally come to terms, Patrick Marber/Mike Nichols provide us with another twist.I haven't seen Marber's play, but I can say he did an awesome job with this screenplay. Mike Nichols is great, as usual. All of the four actors are excellent, especially Clive (just forget ""King Arthur"") and Natalie (George Lucas doesn't know how to lead his actors, in fact – but with the right master, Portman is amazing).""Closer"" is one of the most cruel, realistic romances in recent memory.

stunning exploration about love and sex,"Coming from a relative conservative country, i at first got shocked when watching the movie. the rectangle love between these two couples.it is not difficult to understand since such things happen a lot in big cities. however, what i saw in them and their love are vanity and empty. they are desperate for love while confused about love.when it finished, i kept thinking, what's true love? why are they so painful? i didn't get an answer from the movie.in the movie, they were all talking about love. the word is too big and too confusing. man are too greedy. they make love so selfish and deceptive. i really agree that sometimes it's better not to tell your lover every detail that happen between you and your ex-boy or girl.i think the movie has a very interesting ending. in fact i don't care about the truth very much. the only truth is that Alice has been trying her best to love and get love. though someone may find it disappointing, it's just the course.the performance of them are good though i did care too much about my friends idol"" Juliet Robots"". she is very beautiful, but Alice impressed me most.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
A great view,"Closer is without a doubt a one-of-a-kind film that either gets you off of your seat or grabs your attention to an unusual extent. My reaction to it was the latest.It's a movie that's not for everyone, depends what you're into. But if you like drama, a complex story and odd characters that are not necessarily likable, but yet beautifully written; then this is the kind of film for you. It's about love, break-up, cheating, identity, relationships, among other minor things.I have trouble trying to figure out if it would've been better to have a wider amount of characters, maybe to make the story more real and convincing. But the narrative is fine, and everything about the story really IS about this four complex, relatable and human-like characters that are put under unstable circumstances and vulnerable states of mind.The soundtrack by Damien Rice is outstanding and on point with the story as a whole. I loved the little bits of piano of Cold Water through some of the scenes. All principal actors do an excellent job but Natalie Portman is the one who naturally steals the show, she does indeed a pretty good job with a fascinating performance of the most iconic character here.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

So real it will leave you dumbfounded,"This film is the ""anti- romantic comedy/drama."" Not that it is without any type of love story. Closer is a contemporary, adult film about what we really see, feel, and go through in relationships.Closer strikes a cord from the beginning. The weeping strings from the films lead song, ""The Blower's daughter"" by Damien Rice, should be playing in instrumental form throughout the entire film. But the song will only appear to be weeping at the films conclusion. (when you see the film, you will know what I mean.) For anyone that's ever loved and lost, (and we all have) if the feeling from that loss lingers, this film will cut like a knife. And the sincerity displayed by the wonderful Natalie Portman will break your heart time and time again.Being that this film is more about the ""dark times"" we encounter while riding the relationship roller coaster, I don't know if this is something you see with your girlfriend/boyfriend. Or maybe I say that because I was without one when I saw the film. It was so good, I paid to see it twice in the theater.

Spurts of entertainment in an ultimately miserable story,"This movie is exclusively for adults, I can't see how it would appeal to anyone else.*Spoliers ahead* All of the main characters are spineless for the exception of Larry. Although rash, Larry's character is the only truly honest person in the entire movie. While the other characters swim to find their true desires Larry never faltered or withheld like the others did (especially Dan (Law)).Its hard for the viewer to have sympathy for such poorly developed relationships. All we are shown are the milestones each couple experiences and nothing in between. Certain things simply are not plausible when their visual presentation is omitted. The audience has no choice but to believe that Alice (Portman) used to be/is a heroine addict and that Dan went from a hackneyed obituary writer to a published author in just 2 years despite no personality/character changes whatsoever.The heated dialogue the characters have with each other is the saving grace of the movie. This is the only time the characters seem real to me. As the movie progresses the arguments/conversations get more brutal and more honest, each time more and more truth is revealed.The final piece is left up to the viewer who decides which character was the most deceptive. The characters are left scarred and wounded and any prolonged happiness between any of them is largely suspect.7/10",,Anonymous,Romance
Closer doesn't go far,"What kind of move ignores its subject matter? Closer is a movie about sex or love. Your pick. However, neither makes an appearance. Mike Nicohls gives us a movie with lust and striping (implied, at that) but leaves out the juicy details. If people are accusing Kinsey of keeping its hands clean, they haven't see Closer yet.Based on the stage play of the same name, this is a movie about four people that play musical bed partners for two hours. It doesn't have to end there. There is no reason for us to go home to a real idea of the world other than that people get impatient if something takes longer than they were expecting. That's a great way to explain Alexander's failure without having to bring up the topic of homosexuality. In the case of Closer, the film could have ended after the first half hour, the second half hour and so on. There is a break between each set of screaming matches between yet another different pairing of the only four people in the movie. This is a convenient time to get a refill on your caffeine. What my dad refers to as ""focusing agent"" should make a tidy sum with this film. They should market together. I mean, how else to you plan to stay focused (for lack of a better word) during this event? With such a popular subject, such as love, it is important to be original and to offer something that the guy next door couldn't. A movie should offer something more than depiction of life. Closer presents a very bleak look at love and to accompany that should be a reason. What did these characters do that brought them to this? Why do they settle for it? Each of the four characters is practically that same as their counter part. Of course, there are small differences. Anna is a successful photographer and Alice is a stripper but these things are not big enough to build a character study on and that, at times, is what Closer aims for. In its dissection of this view on love, the characters should be the catalysts but instead serve more as puppets to deliver the witty line that does not add to the over all picture.If we wanted solely a portrait of life, we would watch a documentary. A film is a medium of art that will be bombarded by critics and pretentious moviegoers (myself included) trying to find symbolism. The sad truth here is that the symbols we seek are often not there and what is happens to be nothing more than a chuckling director who knows he has the audience on a string. Still, even when the symbolism is far fetched, there needs to be something to differentiate a movie from a home video. Just because a moment is caught on film does not make it art. Closer is obviously art, no disputing. The problem is that no one bothered to make it interesting art. If I want to watch a movie about love or a movie about sex my choices are endless. Why should I pick this one? Because Natalie Portman is finally a ""grown up""? Because Clive Own is the next big thing? Because Julia Robets ditched the Pretty Woman and $20 million pay check for this?Maybe another day. ***/*****",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

It is a good example for girls to show them how not to act, and not make it all about the guy and do everything the guy says and just ugh that was annoying me.

Wow...,"You would think that a movie about a deceitful mix of four people, would be something along the lines of complete passion, that completely dismisses the painful emotion of love and replaces it with lust. This movie could be nothing further from that. A love triangle, or in this case a square (because it involves 4 people) where all 4 characters romance and ultimately sleep with each others wives and girlfriends. This movie could have easily tossed off as group of people who throw the word love around loosely and would rather get their rocks off than find eternal happiness. This movie could have also made each adulterous character out to be, what most of society would consider human scum. Therefore why have any sympathy for any of them, when each characters morality has been seriously compromised due to overwhelming attractions and lust. Mike Nichols however, avoids this entire scenario by delivering a highly complex, deeply moving masterpiece about the spontaneous attractions we have throughout our lives, and what might possibly happen if these temptations are in fact, acted upon. This movie is created in a unique sort of way. To go further into depth, these four individuals, regardless of what they have done to each other, you cannot help but feel endearing sympathy for all of them. Lines from the script are delivered with passion, conviction, and guilt. Its as if you want a reason to hate these people for their moral shortcomings, but you just cannot due to their vulnerability. I think as far as this film goes, it is a well crafted myriad of human emotion, and fully represents the frailty of what love really means. Well done film. I highly recommend it for anyone interested in a romance, that deeply treads beyond in it's complexity, and sensitivity.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Closer to Natalie you can't come,"For a movie that is so dearly loved and so highly recommended by its fans here on IMDb, this is such a cold fish. I have been struggling with what I was going to say, and that just popped out, and, yes, let me say it again, COLD FISH! Let me admit, I can't stand Jude Baby-Faced Law, and Clive Owen is thuggish, like the other reviewer said, so the male leads are off-putting to begin with. Julia Roberts gives a fine performance, a long way off from the Good Old Days of PRETTY WOMAN, but great. As for all those back-handed compliments she gets from a lot of the reviewers here, take it from me, she is great, no buts about that. Everything you'd expect from a star of her quality. I have taken note of Natalie Portman ever since LÉON THE PROFESSIONAL, but, no, I haven't gone for her sci-fi movie series yet, as I have too many other fish to fry, and I have yet to obtain BEAUTIFUL GIRLS, though I have at least seen that one on a pay channel back in February 1998. To get to the point, I rented this movie years ago for Natalie's sake, and it's been on the back-burner for a helluva long time, but I now at last have my store- bought addition to the RavenGlam collection, and there are of course wonderfully glamorous scenes in it - which you prissy lot out there don't go into, you hypocrites! - but the movie JUST ISN'T FUN TO WATCH! It is MOROSE!**in all fairness, be sure to read the addendum I posted a bit later at the end of the pageNatalie is, of course, absolutely great. I love her arty tearful shot, it would have been up against my wall too! She proves her acting abilities as a grown-up as well. (If you haven't seen her breakthrough movie already mentioned, I highly recommend that you obtain it immediately!)As for the strip sequences, I like that the girls do not play to the lowest common denominator, i.e. (on-stage) they remain beautiful and classy, in their slinky pole-swirling perfection. Natalie is stunningly beautiful, love her upper body ratio (the length of her back compared to the length of her legs) and she is simply breathtaking at the start of that second strip sequence (Danny's visit). The thuggish old doctor, of course, has more hardcore tastes, and has her maneuvering into a less glamorous wide-legged pose, off-putting, but that's what crude guys are like. And, though it's strategically self-censored by Doc. Larry's head, it's really more explicit if you view it in slow motion a smidge further on, when she gets up. Almost full frontal for a fragment of a second. Or so it might seem. But not really. Sharon Stone's notorious scene, more than a decade before her, brought to mind. But just as near as dammit. Unfortunately, the pose it led up to, on all fours, is left (mostly) to the viewer's imagination, although she did already bent over for him during the 'flirting' stage of her performance. You'd never ever see Natalie like this anywhere else or ever again. Celebrity skin! And creamy-smooth! With the rear view virtually fully on display for us lowly mortals! Her nakedest film appearance! Of top-ranked actresses, a rarity! To quote her, ""Thank you!""But aside from all that beauty, the movie is so dismal, that one is left feeling the need for something brighter, more cheerful, more worthy of one's attention. Granted, the movie deserves more than my score, but I subtract minus points for it being such a COLD FISH.Addendum, later the same day. I've analyzed this after some repeated viewing. I've really damned this one for being so wretchedly confusing. We were supposed to instantly latch onto the script skipping a year or so ahead? The disjointed non-linear presentation alienated me instantly; I figured something was wrong, and while I was fumbling about, reacted negatively to the movie. It's like crucial scenes were deleted, we just got the highlights. I'm prepared to say that my initial comments here are quite unfair, that it really is a good movie, but SERIOUSLY FLAWED.

Closer,"Writer ""Dan"" (Jude Law) likes to spend his evenings, when not with his American girlfriend ""Alice"" (Natalie Portman), teasing other blokes on sex-chat sites. One night he sets up doctor ""Larry"" (Clive Owen) with a promise to meet at the aquarium with ""Anna"". The horned up physician duly turns up, only to discover that meantime ""Dan"" has vengefully despatched the real ""Anna"" (Julia Roberts) - his part time lover/photographer, to unknowingly meet him instead. Embarrassed looks, sighs and ""Larry"" feels like a prat but, maybe the outwardly rather aloof ""Anna"" is interested? What now ensues is all a bit entertainingly far-fetched as an unwitting ménage-à-quatre emerges, becoming increasingly more intimate, then loving, then manipulatively toxic. Are any of these people destined to find happiness with any of the others. Quite frankly, do they deserve it and do we care? I've always found Owen as wooden as a washboard, but here - especially sharing the screen with an on-form Portman, he actually seems to be able to act (a little). His character, I found, comfortably the most odious of the four. Portman is the star of the show, though. Her portrayal of the needy sex kitten vacillates from provocative to desperate with a compelling ease. There's frequently some vitriol in the writing and the juggled storylines well paced as this story of unlikeable people moves along quickly. I think this might work well on stage, it has a characterful intensity to it, but on screen it's well worth a watch - even if it's all a pretty grim appraisal of human behaviour.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

They're missing the point: this movie profoundly blows.I mean, I'm not too terribly familiar with this Mike Nichols guy's work, but the film-making here was flat and uninspired throughout. Dare I say amateurish. At no point does the film engage the audience. None of the characters are believable, the movie gives you nothing that lets you care about them... The performances were good, given what the cast had to work with (Clive Owen is best, but they're all remarkable actors), but good performances mean bugger-all when the characters aren't believable. It was all so much melodrama, I could've gotten the same thing from three or four episodes of All My Children. ""I love you, I never loved you, I'll always love you, I hate you, I love her, Now I love you again, oh wait, I'm just lusting after you, but really I love you..."" Come on.This movie was totally empty. And don't say that ""emptiness"" was the point, because you don't get that point across by just leaving huge holes in the narrative and the character development.And whose idea was it to compare this garbage to Lost in Translation? Closer is totally devoid of substance, is very shallow, and deals primarily with empty lust. Lost in Translation, on the other hand, has several different levels of depth, meaning, complexity and deals with real emotions, love (platonic or otherwise)... has well developed characters...

Unknown Pleasures,"Here we have a house built of sexual envy, unfettered passion, deception, longing, betrayal, hatred . . . insert your own cliché. But in bringing these bricks to the building site, writer Patrick Marber has forgotten one crucial thing . . . his architectural drawing. In other words, Closer is a rickety edifice permanently on the point of collapse.Marber is not helped in his task by two of the most woeful pieces of miscasting in mainstream cinema history. Yes, I'm talking about the two 'big names'.Jude Law is execrable as newspaper obituary writer Dan. His character is supposed to be enigmatic, artistic, a romantic. What we actually get is an utterly unbelievable, two-dimensional fallacy. At no point does the viewer engage with his persona, such as it is. One never feels sympathy, empathy or even antipathy, simply a numb disbelief that he is here at all. Law is not just wooden, he's cardboard.And if he's cardboard, Julia Roberts playing Anna (a kind of glammier Annie Leibovitz transplanted to London) is overstretched rubber. As a femme fatale, she makes a great candlestick. For her, acting is a business; a by-numbers routine in which the only digits she seems to care about are the ones on her pay cheque.So, half the main cast might just as well not have turned up. Which is a shame, because the other two have something of the superb about them. Natalie Portman as the stripper Alice is more than mere eye candy; she has a naturalness seldom seen on the big screen (even if the lap dancing scenes jar).But far and away the best performance comes from Clive Owen. It is in his character, Larry, that Marber comes closest to achieving his goal of bridging the gap between entertainment and philosophical contemplation. Larry is a feral, animalistic, dermatologist for whom love is really only skin deep. Through his predilections and tastes, he proves that as a species, we are deluding ourselves if we think human beings are anything more than a series of sensation-seeking interconnected orifices.If anything, Owen is too good for this film. We are meant to be appalled by him, to be repulsed by his base desires. But it is such a relief when he is on screen, that all his character's sins are forgiven.",,Anonymous,Romance

Disappointing :(,"Well, I went to see this movie because I am a huge Julia Roberts fan...and I also really like Natalie Portman.If you are considering seeing it.....I can't recommend the movie. Maybe you will see it and like it, but I can't guarantee it. It was.....odd.One minute, two people are just meeting, the very next scene they've been living together for a while, the next scene a year has gone by.....The jury is still out....I really have to think about whether I liked this film or not. It's been more than 24 hours since I saw it.

"Good Performances, Mixed Writing","I was left with very mixed feelings after finishing ""Closer."" While there are many things that work in the film, it is a largely uneven picture, and ultimately doesn't quite live up to the hopes that I brought to the viewing. Having loved Mike Nichols' ""The Graduate"" and being impressed by the strong cast, I was looking forward to another thoughtful, moving, yet funny picture from Nichols. And while there is some genuinely witty writing to be found in ""Closer,"" I found that most of the dialogue takes the form of verbal ""showdowns"" as the characters interrogate and try to manipulate each other, which although sharp and snappy at first, begins to become slightly tiresome in the long run.The film moves along at a steady pace. It starts strongly with an opening scene that immediately draws the audience, as Dan (Jude Law) takes Alice (Natalie Portman) to the hospital after she is hit by a car, which leads to the start of their romance. The film's editing sees large time shifts occur very suddenly, and without even witnessing the high points of their relationship, we are taken to where it begins to fall apart, as Dan becomes infatuated with a photographer, Anna (Julia Roberts). From this point on, the theme of appearance vs reality, already implied through Dan's work as a writer of obituaries which use euphemisms to ""cover up"" the deceased's lesser qualities (a clever aspect of the screenplay), begins to dominate the love ""rectangle"" between Dan, Alice, Anna, and Larry (Clive Owen).The characters in ""Closer"" are all morally ambiguous, and their tendency to utilize lies and deception is what makes the film unpredictable. It must be said that all the performances are solid, although Natalie Portman shines brightest as the sly, seductive Alice. Furthermore, the direction is sound, yet somewhat ordinary and uninspired in comparison to ""The Graduate,"" for which Nichols won the Oscar for Best Director.Ultimately, while ""Closer"" is entertaining for the most part, the strange thing is that it fails to have much of an emotion impact, despite the clear emotional pains that the characters endure.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Worth a  Closer look! Your viewing time will not be wasted.,"Closer, directed by Mike Nichols, is a romantic drama that's little on the romance and high on the drama. It tells the tale of four strangers who, through meetings of chance, become two couples embroiled in the lives of one another, leading to an existence that can only contain false hearts. The film is hard hitting and to put it simply, strips the personal lives of leading characters bare.We open the scene with Dan (Jude Law) a clever but unsuccessful journalist who writes obituaries, one day he chances upon Alice (Natalie Portman), after witnessing her being hit by a car he decides to take her to the hospital. Alice is a beautiful, care-free American girl, who worked as a stripper in NY but left to flee from a relationship. Alice immediately falls for Dan, and gives him her love without holding back. Dan is initially enchanted with Alice, and returns her affection, but while she inspires him to write his novel (based on her life), her neediness begins to wear on him. Enter, Anna (Julia Roberts) who plays a photographer hired to take a portrait of Dan for the dust jacket of his novel; Dan is instantly besotted by her, the two flirt and in his words 'must see her again'.Time passes and a bored Dan impersonates a woman named ""Anna"" on an online chat room and sets up a date with Larry (Clive Owen), a stranger. Inadvertedly, this leads to Anna marrying Larry (an honest-but-bullish dermatologist) much to Dan's bemusement. Anna & Dan are in constant indecision about their relationships and the four lives soon become complicated and deceitful. What's intriguing is the fact all the characters conduct their private lives in a complete contrast to how they are perceived on the outside, maintaining clean cut images, dressing with style, all presenting a public persona without blemish! One might think they all are just interested in themselves.Two things standout in this film for me; the first is the script. Written by Patrick Marber (based on his award-winning 1997 play of the same name) It contains brilliant dialogue which even though holds many profanities, is straight talking honest stuff which each character takes on with much aplomb. The second highlight of the film is the performance of Clive Owen. Each actor plays there role well and this is what we expect of such an A-list cast, yet the most notable performance is that of Clive Owen. His brash but truthful turn as Doctor Larry is acted with complete conviction, as if he himself has lived through such a twisted web of romance.The director ensures the film comes full circle leaving you with a feeling of wonder when the credits roll. Throughout it, he keeps everything knitted tightly together and the viewer can feel the troubled nature of what is unfolding before them with scenes solely focused on the acting, as the rest of the mise-en-scène is kept sophisticatedly minimal and the use of camera close ups on faces help identify with the emotions being portrayed. Mike Nichols has a great CV and although this movie will not instantly jump out, it does fits nicely onto it and also shows he still has the touch in the modern era.The reason many people will not highly rate this film is due to the uncomfortable 'everyday life' like plot. This being, the candid look at just how quickly things can change when instant attraction occurs. Closer is intense in its portrayal of relationship dynamics, its complexities and perhaps love, if we can call it that (because the four certainly do). A question that will be asked is, can they actually be in love when the word has lost all meaning in the betrayals that has been laid, or can it be restored when the trust which it is built upon has crumbled? My advice is if you after a romantic film with a happy ending then seek comfort in another film, but if you would like to view a well acted, unsympathetic, delight of screen play, then I fully recommended this.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Sexual Ping-Pong,"This is a difficult film to like (imho) because as many other comments have noted, the characters are unsympathetic jerks. Further, I saw no chemistry among the various permutations and combinations of the four leads, nor any development of relationships. Perhaps better acting or staging could have floated this sinking ship.The characters appear to jump into connections (I won't dignify them with the term relationships) with nothing more behind them than that they have ended up in close proximity to the other at some point. If any of you ride or have ridden a subway or crowded bus route, would you have sex with someone just because he or she happened to be standing near you one day? Exchange pleasantries, some banter supposed to be witty, lips get trembly, kiss, have sex. The concept is preposterous. Or, I missed out on a heck of a lot of potential activity back in my subway riding days! With all due respect (my better half bought this turkey for $3 at an odd-lot discount store), this had ""chick flick"" written all over it, confirmed by the sappy opening dirge.In addition (as others have noted), the flashbacks and fast-forwards are not differentiated from ""real time"" at all, making the activities even more difficult to follow. This is worsened by the unsympathetic personalities of the leads.Definitely, one to miss...",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
True love is all about sex?,"This film is truly a puzzle to me. It's like I'm being asked to take seriously the childish antics of the characters while they go on their childish, sexually deviant escapades disguised as love.None of it had any depth. It was simply an exploration into the irrational, pompous, and primal nature of the intimate relationships of human beings.There was truly only an intangled mess of lust and misplaced love.I'm left wandering why even bother making a film with such empty subject matter while also framing it like there's such powerful wisdom to be found here?No, the characters all displayed how they were simultaneously deceptive and jealous and never once evolved past their primitive and immensely sexual nature. If that is the purpose of the movie, I fail to see the value in that.",2.0,Anonymous,Romance

a reflection...,"I liked this movie, just watched it yesterday. I found the script brutally honest in some parts. Lets face it. In real life we cheat, lie and have sex. So do these people.But...I don't understand how Alice/Jane could be so in love with Dan, but lie to him for four years and not tell him the truth about her name. Thats the one thing I didn't get. I was told that it is explained in the strip club seen with Larry, but I still didn't get what her motivation was.Overall, I connected with the three characters, not sympathizes. Not Alice though, She is a complicated cat that I just didn't understand at the end. But maybe that was her job as a character. She seemed to be the victim through the whole film, yet when we find out the truth, we feel betrayed as an audience...just like Dan would of. Cos in the end, arn't we supposed to feel sorry for him and Anna? Them being the two main characters who arn't together, even when they love each other.So anywayz, I see where they are coming from, and it scares me that we as people are like Dan, Anna, Larry and Alice too.

"""Closer"" is a great film","Just saw this movie yesterday, and it was so good I watched it twice. I try to see everything Natalie Portman is in, and I have been liking Clive Owen better and better with every project he does, so I have been looking forward to seeing this one for awhile. I have been cheated on in a relationship, and all elements about honesty and needing to know rang true for me. The movie reminded me a little of ""Dangerous Liasions"" in that sex was used almost like a weapon by the characters. The whole ""Love at first sight"" thing was a great tag-line for this movie, because all the characters seemed to have that happen to them at least once during the movie. Also, seeing Portman play a stripper is a new turn for her. She's all grown up now.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Interesting movie,"I am overall intrigued by this film. The personal lives of all people involved in this foursome is somewhat sleazy, but the script made it interesting and very believable. It was nice to see Julia Roberts in a very adult/sexual role which is a big change from the family friendly stuff she usually does. I am not convinced she was the proper actress for this role though.It is sort of love story about 2 couples who cannot decide who or what they want in life. Do they want their own spouses or someone else's? Are they with this one person because they love them, or because they cannot have the one they want. If you cannot be with the one you love, love the one your with.Clive Owen and Jude Law are gorgeous. Julia roberts, what a lucky gal to be able to snog these 2 hotties in one movie.Brillian script. The writing on this deserves a huge honerable mention. ""Everything is a version of something else.""Pretty good movie. 8/10.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
A Raw and Intense Drama with a Phenomenal Natalie,"Closer is an emotionally raw and brutally honest exploration of love, betrayal, and desire. The film's sharp dialogue and complex characters make it an engaging watch, but its cold and cynical take on relationships might not be for everyone. While the performances are strong across the board, the story at times feels overly theatrical, making it hard to fully connect with the characters.That being said, Natalie Portman is absolutely phenomenal in this movie. She delivers one of the most captivating performances of her career, bringing depth, vulnerability, and intensity to her role. She proves once again that she is the greatest actress in the whole world history. On top of that, she looks absolutely breathtaking.

"Getting ""closer"" to the truth....","This is a raw adult drama,and is very good thoughtful entertainment. If you want a mushy Hollywood style ""romance"" then this movie ain't for you. Two men and two women who are really into lust rather than love show us some of the sexual politics of real relationships and its' a game of cat and mouse where the strongest and cleverest is likely to win the day.This film comes from a play and whilst one of the leads,Clive Owen,is lauded by many for his performance,yet for me he came across as slightly artificial delivering lines that did not come from his character but from a writer. Seems the picture could have been ever better if the two male leads exchanged roles. Nevertheless the story is still an engrossing show and when movie makers start to try to tell the truth about life, as this film attempts, rather then portray things in fantasy terms, then we have a decent film experience.

Watch if you're in the mood for a reality check,"This movie seemed like a harsh reality check about love, honesty, relationships, jealousy, sex, and lust. Its usually is hard for me to get into most movies but the screenplay kept me wanting to know more. It seemed like a real eye-opener with how people work and how relationship dynamics can be different with different people. I know it was originally a play and that's how it came off. Besides the four in the relationships, are no other actors and very minimal shooting locations. All four main actors were great and kept me intrigued to the entire time. The overall message seems to be that honesty doesn't always bring us closer and for most people even if things are great in a relationship, there will always be something else someone is looking for.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
What a disappointment!!,"I have voted to give this movie a six, not for the story, but for the acting by the star studded cast. Jude Law (the everywhere mane) is very good, as well as the rest of the cast which consists of Julia Roberts, Natalie Portman and Clive Owen. With a cast like this how can you go wrong, well it did as far as I am concerned. I am no prude, but the dialog in this movie was excessive, and about 2/3 through the picture I had enough and got up and walked out. I can see the point of mixed relationships, and how a story can develop from it, but the sexual theme got out of hand.

"great performances, decent movie","I'm puzzled by a lot of people who've torn this movie apart. Some movies I can understand people's scathing indictments of, but not this one. The only shortcoming of this film to me is that at many points it's TOO much like a play. Dialog in stage plays always seems a little too literate and over the top, something that's always bothered me with few exceptions of this ""genre"" (if indeed it could be called one).That said, this is definitely a must see for anyone who wants to watch an accurate portrait of love/lust's darker side. Despite some of the dialog, the cast excels at filling every breath and line with all the emotional pathos that you'd find in similar everyday occurrences. Each character takes turns throughout the movie hurting and being hurt by one another as only those in tangled sexual relationships know how to do. Yes, the language is graphic, but anyone who's been cheated should understand that masochistic desire to know every detail of the other's infidelity.Clive Owen is by far the standout in this film. Larry, though the most nasty and devious, is by contrast the most human and understanding of the world of relationships. He only hurts when he's been hurt and excels at doing so. While he knows that his relationship with Anna is ultimately unfulfilling for her, he also recognizes that she is incapable of such a relationship. His knowledge of human nature is clinical and raw, but does not lack heart, as he does seem to truly care for her. Law, by contrast shows the least amount of understanding of the same condition. He's ultimately the most childish, as is pointed out by Roberts withing the first five minutes of their meeting. He bounces from one woman to the other emotionally as it suits his need for a companion and it duly comes back to him in the end. While Law seems to be the more able at manipulation initially, he quickly proves unable to keep the lie alive. This is one of Law's better performances. He successfully undermines his wit and looks with the aforementioned immaturity, not something he pulled off very well in Alfie.Both women put in good performances, but have less to work with than the men. Roberts seems woefully overshadowed by the rest of the cast. She holds her own and with a lesser cast would no doubt excel, but this is not that cast. However, I have to admit I've never really found her to be that engaging of an actress, so I could be a little biased. She's good at being an ice queen, but her characters lacks the warmth of a fully developed person. Portman, however, stands out in her role as Alice. As Larry comments, she has the ""moronic beauty of youth"" and she eloquently embodies that phrase. In her initial break-up scene with Law you can feel how hurt she is and how desperate she is for affection and love. What's more, you can also sense that, because of her age, she has no real concept of what that very thing is. She's a child playing adult games of the heart. Unlike Dan, she is saved by her character's youth and ability to still learn from such mistakes. Portman's only performance drawback is her inability to seem real, especially when she's not interacting directly with someone on camera.Without a human to work off of, she seems emotionally lost to a point and tends to overact.All in all, this is an excellent portrait of what it is to be human. Those who chastise the character's immorality as unlikeable don't understand that this trait lies dormant in everyone, especially in matters of the heart. Realistic people in realistic situations make for a fascinating character study of the more base side of human relationships.",,Anonymous,Romance

Very Good,"Once again, Mike Nichols shows us just how clever he is. I don't agree that this is his best film in years - let's not forget Primary Colors, Birdcage, and the heavenly brilliant Angels in America (ignore Wolf and What Planet Are You From), but it certainly is a return to his roots, and definitely his most serious and straightforward film in many years, probably since Carnal Knowledge. It shares, in fact, many of the themes and qualities of Carnal Knowledge (as well as other early classics like the Graduate and Who's Afraid of Virginia Wolf) - Like that film, its scale is very small in place and very large in time, following a small group of characters over long time gaps; likewise, we only catch glimpses of their lives, and get most of the information on important events from the characters themselves. Like Carnal Knowledge, Closer focuses on inter-relations between the four main characters, betrayal, mistrust and insincerity. Closer is bleaker, though. It's probably the bleakest thing Nichols had done. It's a downer that doesn't seem extremely special and original as you watch it, but it sticks with you. After all, that's an important mark of a good film.As for the acting, now: despite my patriotic support of Natalie Portman (her being originally from Israel) and my undying love for her ever since I saw her as a child in Leon, she didn't really impress me in Closer. She tries to be sexy and mysterious, but she's still just a sweet girl, and she doesn't truly convince. Julia Roberts had always gotten on my nerves, and Closer is no exception. The male actors are the ones who really outdo themselves here; Jude Law and Clive Owen are both fantastic, obnoxious and pathetic at the same time as only a real man can be. You despise them and you pity them and you understand them. You are them. These are two great young actors who have a bright future ahead of them.Interestingly enough, Mike Nichols never did write his own texts. All of his films were written by other people, and like Who's Afraid of Virginia Wolf and Angels in America, Closer is also an adapted play. Yet he has a fascinating way of making the texts his own. The dialogues in Closer are well-written, no doubt; but just like in his previous films, it's his brilliant dialogue directing with which Nichols leaves his distinct mark and which makes it convincing, amusing and unnerving all at once. Nichols may not have a vision like Kubrick, Coppola or Scorsese, but he does what he does the best anyone could.Closer is not an essential, and it's not one of the best films of the year. It's well worth a watch though, especially if you're a Mike Nichols fan or if you enjoy human relations melodramas. Not great, but very good.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Four people and the tangled web they weave,"In a single moment the lives of four strangers who have no connection to one another will be changed forever. A man and a woman meet in unusual circumstances and their lives will never be the same. What's more a woman whom neither of them will meet until a year later and a man who won't enter the picture until a further year later also will have their fates decided in this single moment. One day you're minding your own business and your life's path is determined because a young American woman you don't even know looks the wrong way when crossing a London street and is hit by a taxi. Funny how life works sometimes.Alice, a 20-year old stripper who has just arrived in London, is the young woman who has the unfortunate meeting with the taxicab. She's not seriously hurt. Flesh wound really. But this moment changes everything. As she lies in the street she is attended to by Dan, a man she had spotted across the street and sort of flirted with in the moments before she stepped into the taxi's path. Inevitably they fall in love. But it will not necessarily be happily ever after. A year later we find that Dan, who writes newspaper obituaries, has written a novel based on Alice's life. As he is being photographed for publicity for the book he flirts with the American photographer, Anna, shares a kiss with her and ends up trying to talk her into having an affair. Alice discovers this and tells Anna, but not Dan, that she knows. And having asked Anna to take her portrait Alice has the moment that her heart breaks forever committed to film. Another year goes by, a year in which Dan stalks Anna without success. One night Dan enters a cybersex chat room where, while pretending to be Anna, he meets dermatologist Larry. Dan sets up a meeting between Larry and ""Anna"" but when Larry in fact does meet up with the real Anna a funny thing happens. Larry and Anna fall in love.So now we've met our four players and the fun can begin. By fun I mean lying, cheating, backstabbing and generally reprehensible behavior. The four are all brought together when that photo Anna took of a tearful Alice is displayed in her photo exhibition. Dan and Alice are still a couple but Dan uses the occasion of the exhibition to pick up his pursuit of Anna and this time she relents. They carry on an affair for a year, even as Anna marries Larry in the meantime. Eventually Anna and Dan admit their indiscretions to their respective partners and leave those relationships for one another. But there are still plenty more twists and turns to come in this tale. Through it all the story is engaging. It's a smart, serious, adult drama which captivates throughout.Much of the film's success can be attributed to the winning performances of the four lead performers who for all intents and purposes are really the only performers in the film. Julia Roberts, as Anna, probably has the least showy and thus least memorable of the four roles but her performance is certainly fine. The other three stars really shine. Natalie Portman as Alice, Jude Law as Dan and Clive Owen as Larry are all on top of their games. Each of the three have some truly powerful moments and they do so well in bringing some rather complex and conflicted characters to life. There's a lot of emotion in this story, sometimes bubbling under the surface and sometimes on full, raw display. And all four of the stars convey that emotion wonderfully. The characters they play may at times be hard for the viewer to embrace. These are people capable of some truly dastardly deeds so this certainly isn't an uplifting, feel-good kind of movie. It's a movie which if nothing else is honest, sometimes brutally so. You may not love these characters but you can't help but appreciate their story.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Close to Perfection!,"There is no doubt in my medulla oblongata that one cannot close their eyes when they observe the vigor & barbarity of Mike Nichols' ""Closer"". The film stars Jude Law, Julia Roberts, Clive Owen, and Natalie Portman as four impassioned human species who have ""closer encounters of the swapping kind"". Disclaimer: this is not a romantic comedy! Not even close! The film focuses on the verbal savagism lovers can say to one another. In more simplistic terms: it is not sometimes the lies that we do want to hear, but is the truths we do not want to hear. This Nichols' film reminds me much of his sexually orientated classic ""Carnal Knowledge"". I guess mike got back into his carnivorous ways and brought us back some ""carne con bollo"". Unfortunately in ""Closer"", Director Mike did not show us Julia & Natalie's aforementioned body part. ""Closer"" was written by Patrick Marber, who also scripted the play that is based on. Do you know the name of it? Yes, you are close! It's also called ""Closer""! Marber did a ""marberlous"" job in adapting his own play with a calenture-type dialogue. Roberts & Law were grand as Dan & Anna. But I must say that as close as ""Closer"" gets to acting supremacy does not come from our superstars Jude & Julia. That illustrious honor would go to the robust works of Owen & Portman as Larry & Alice. Natalie was an ""Alice in Acting Wonderland"" and Clive's Larry was one of the most stalwart movie pervs of all-time. Owen's acting was a masterpiece of pervection, I mean perfection.

Story of 4 people hurting each other......,"Closer (2004) is a movie about 4 people who all are romantically or sexually involved with one another at some point in the course of the movie. Clive Owen, Natalie Portman, Julia Roberts, and Jude Law all turn in fabulous performances here, Owen and Portman even earning academy award nominations for their portrayals. The movie has fitting dialogue for the subject matter it deals with, it gets highly sexually explicit at several points due to what's happening. The tense scenes that contain fighting and yelling between the characters because of the deception and betrayal are the ones that are the most well done in my opinion. The film offers up a very raw and realistic view of these people and I think that is good, because the film had to be graphic and real, in order to show the true feelings and torture these characters endure. There are a couple places where you feel exhausted from the goings on, because things are constantly changing, but it's supposed to be that way. 7/10 for Closer.

Review of the film Closer,"This is a painfully honest film and one of the best of the year. A story of two couples and the uncomfortable way in which their lives overlap one another. Their relationships are train wrecks and falling pianos where individual selfishness outweighs guilt. I was struck by the depravity and carelessness of the characters in their desperation for love.Natalie Portman is as always beautiful and beguiling but the real star in this film is Clive Owen who plays the larger than life Larry. He is shockingly harsh and brash and intense and you can love him and hate him in the same 10 minutes. But that can also be said of all of the characters.This film is haunting. Damien Rice's Blower's Daughter makes the story cling to you like a chill and it is beautiful and disturbing at the same time. Beware, this is not your Mother's romantic story.

a good primer on why telling the truth is not a sign of maturity.,"The more this movie progressed the less I liked it and the characters that inhabit it. Well.. except for Natalie Portman, who's still adorable as a self loathing waif. The language gets to be quite brutal and crude, and is reminiscent of Nichols' earlier grittier 'Carnal Knowledge'. This is the way writers want people to talk when they're more concerned with being genuine than with being evolved.Clive Owen puts a big dent in his 'new heart throb' rating with a really vicious turn as a sleazy Doctor whose only emotional range seems to be egotistic rage vented on anyone who he can't control or who bests him. His lines are the most profane in the movie, mixing every common sexual expletive with his vitriol. But he thinks he's being wonderfully genuine!Julia Roberts plays a co-dependent who goes with whichever of the male leads who wants her the most at the time. She's playing against her star quality and she does fine in this ratcheted down persona. Jude Law on the other hand struggles as a feckless loser who feels secure with Natalie's one down role but is over his head with the stronger Julia.The movie has many problems. The lines work better on stage, and the characters would be better played by actors not movie stars - again I would exclude darling Natalie who is still enjoying quirky character roles. The dialogue is clever but as it comes from the mouths of shallow people trying to tell the truth it just comes out as self evident dialogue. Finally it fails because uninteresting hollow people just aren't interestingexcept for sweet little Natalie, of course.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

So I guess people go to see a film because of the actors but I wonder how many people were deceived into seeing it because of Julia, or Jude, etc. They may be disappointed because this is based on a play and is about how love eludes and hurts us. I wasn't much into the film, and in fact many people around me were squirming. This is the kind of film that film snobs love because it's ""edgy"" with the negative emotions and frank sexual dialogue. I can't identify with how badly these characters behave, thank God for that. My love life certainly has never been so horrid that I wonder if the playwright had a miserable existence and wants everyone else to suffer through this story. In any case, I don't recommend Closer if you still have hope for love.",,Anonymous,Romance
This is what Closer is.,"Before watching this film I was aware of the fact that ""Closer"" had been a supremely popular stage production in Britain which had inspired Nichols to bring it to film. So, naturally, I came into the theater expecting a complete disaster. I was happy to realize that this film was not a total loss -- if a loss at all.Nichols's depiction of the four lovers (literally) was like a wildlife expert observing four animals during mating season. One of them was going to mess with the wrong female, and that one was going to end up a rotting carcass. But I have to say, Roberts played her role as an adulterous extremely well. All first-billed actors did exactly as they should've in this film, and more.Audiences are much too used to attaching themselves to the protagonist, and allow themselves to be dragged in the dirt by the proverbial leash. Sorry to break this to you, folks, but NONE OF THESE CHARACTERS WERE Lovable. Not. One. Like others, I was prone to sympathize with 'Alice' for a great portion of the film, but of course that went out the window by the end of the first hour.Dan was a desperate pervert. Larry was a perverted prick. Anna was a frigid bitch. Alice was a slut. And to top it all off, all four characters could have just as easily switched roles and screwed themselves over at the blink of an eye. This, of course, lead to their destruction, and in some cases, their resurrection.I doubt many Americans, who have now receded into their conservative holes in the ground will appreciate this film as much as the overseas proprietors, but hey ... who cares? I loved this movie. It's one that will never grow old, never get wrinkles, and never get thrown into it the vault for losing its aesthetics. It was a terribly haunting film, and I loved it.The only kink I had with this movie? I left the theater extremely depressed and hating all men (and women). *** out of ****",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
A small film about love and betrayal. Mostly betrayal.,"A small film about love and betrayal. Mostly betrayal. It is obviously made from a play, with four main characters, any two of which are on-screen at all times. The plot is pretty good, albeit with its fair share of contrivances and coincidences. But, if not for these things, what would there be to make movies about? The four main actors were all excellent, though none are very likable. Jude Law pays his role as weaselly and pathetic. Clive Owens' character is macho, controlling, and conniving. Julia Roberts is, as always, oddly beautiful, although she looks a bit older now. This may have been a deliberate decision, to better contrast her with Natalie Portman's character. Miss Portman, when it is called for, is achingly beautiful. When she bestows on us a wide smile, I thought my TV would melt. I don't believe I've seen her in anything before. (Not being a Star Wars geek) (OK, I've just looked at her page, and it seems she played the little girl in ""The Professional"". She was quite good, but I did not recognize her twelve years later.) The real star, however, was the script. They all have such wonderfully clever dialog. I would say check it out.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
"You could not watch this movie, but it's better if you do","I'm not gonna lie, I did enjoy this movie. I think the soundtrack fitted perfectly, the dialogue was beautifully written, the characters managed to seem human, deeply flawed but reasonable... The way the time passes keeps you up on your feet, and the performances were just as amazing. It came across, at least to me, as a quite believable and unpredictable plot. However, it doesn't fulfill my expectations.
Maybe I should have seen this movie knowing that other's people's praise for it would be ruining my own experience, but that didn't happen. I've seen people naming this film as one of the ones that shaped them as a person, I've heard albums that, now that I've seen the movie, seem completely extracted from it. Perhaps this is how I've taken the most out of this film, by seeing and enjoying art that derived from it, and therefore this movie, even if in itself came as a disappointment to me, did mark me quite a lot.
But did I love it? Does the effect it already had in my life balance out the lack of it the experience of watching brought to me? Probably not. Maybe this is a problem that not many people will have with this movie, so you probably will be alright and will enjoy it as long as you can appreciate good cinematography without needing a mind blowing plot. But it didn't work that well for me.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Gritty viewing,"I loved closer. It was different, realistic and confrontational. It was nice to see a movie with such big celebs that didn't have a happy ending. Like life, it turned out not as we expect it too. The actors were great, Natalie Portman is a star and even though the other three characters were unlikeable, i liked alice/jane. She wasn't willing to give all of her self to the Dan character, and for good reason. She is also gobsmackingly desirable. Julia Roberts was also good and even if her Anna character was a indecisive sad sack, that's what i liked about it, because there are actually people out there like that! Relationships hardly ever work out and its nice to see something not in the typical, happily ever after Hollywood genre. After reading a lot of other opinions on this site i felt compelled to say my bit about this standout flick. Kudos to the cast and crew on such a gritty flick.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
"The photographer, the writer, his wife & her lover","Patrick Marber's play at first hand seems to portray modern relations between four people. But there's much more to this: Larry is a doctor in order to express a pure physical (human) animal. He reacts to basic instincts and the fact that he 'wins' is perhaps a comment on our modern society. The most fascinating character is Alice (mind the name) because it's not so sure that she exists in the screen world for real or only in the imagination of the characters. The opening and ending sequences seem to support this notion. She's the subject of the writer's book, and the writer is in the movie as the one who documents relations (with her). Typical for a writer is his subjective view on events. A photographer has less ability to distort reality and therefore Alice is crying on the only picture of her that's shown at the exposition. Meanwhile, the doctor lives out his sexual fantasies on her, but the fact that he cannot touch her in vital segments of the movie is only proof of his inability to have human contact or indeed, come closer.Although well structured as a play and movie I was surprised to find the writing details very uneven. Horrible, immature lines (for example, the first lines of the movie) and brilliant, mature lines are intertwined and as a result it brings the movie down as a whole.As director Mike Nichols does a fine job, but some more experimenting would have seriously enhanced the value (see Dogville for example of a more experimental 'movie as a play'). Also the movie drags a little in continually toggling between the love the four characters show for each other.For an actor, there's no better movie to act than in these ones, but it's also very dangerous as there's almost no hiding to cover any weaknesses. Especially Jude Law disappoints here with a terrible flat performance, Julia Roberts holds up reasonably, Clive Owen is interesting and his portrayal will certainly play very well with British audiences, and Natalie Portman shines again and is rapidly developing in one of the better actresses of our time.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Fantastic, brutally honest film","For anyone who has been through the experience of betrayal in a relationship as either the perpetrator or the victim (or both, for many of us :) ), the dialog in this film will feel so real that you'll swear they had your place bugged when writing the script. Of course, not all of us look quite as beautiful as this cast, but the long for love and the reality of human frailty is as true for regular folk as it is for the Julia Roberts of the world.The plot revolves around four people and their relationships with one another. The story unfolds in a relatively small number of scenes that jump thru time, often giving just enough clues at the beginning of each scene to fill in the gaps concerning events that took place since the last scene. In this way the movie allows the viewer to skip the day to day routine of their lives and focus instead on the intense emotional moments.Although the characters are very human they are not very nice, which is what made it disturbing for me to recognize elements of them in myself. Still, the performances are all spot on and so intense that I actually found myself holding my breath at several points during the film. For Portman especially, this feels like a break out film that changes her image from girl to woman. Clive Owen also turns in an amazing performance that never quite lets you sympathize with or completely hate his character.Finally, be warned that the subject matter and language of the film are very adult and that the film is essentially all talk talk talk. If you are sensitive to dark themes or an action movie buff you may want to pick another flick.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
The ugliness we don't want to want,"Mike Nichols' Closer is a rough blow to any soul who considers themselves a hopeless romantic or somebody who believes in unconditional, true love at first sight. Having recently been involved in an incredibly open, romantic friendship that had me caught under love's uncompromising spell only to be slammed down by hardened reality and poor circumstance, Nichols' film is just the kind of bitter but brutally honest work on the subject I needed. Here is a film that recognizes the human desire for truth and honesty, and the simultaneous closure and pain it can provide, whilst examining, paradoxically, how much pain and suffering true love can leave someone.The film opens in London, with two strangers, Alice Ayres (Natalie Portman) and Dan Woolf (Jude Law), catching each others eyes on a crowded street before Alice is unexpectedly hit by a taxi in the crosswalk. Dan takes her to the hospital, where she remains stable and discharged soon after, and the two strike up a companionship obviously destined for some kind of romantic relationship along the line. She is an American woman who worked as a stripper before coming to live in London, and he's a failed British author who now writes obituaries for a London-based newspaper.A year later, though Alice and Dan are in a relationship, Dan begins to minimize his loyalty by flirting and sharing a kiss with an American photographer named Anna Cameron (Julia Roberts), who is photographing him for his upcoming novel on Alice's life. When Anna comes over one day to photograph Alice, Dan secretly asks Anna to have an affair with him, to which she refuses. Alice overhears the conversation but pretends like she didn't, even as she notices Dan stalking Anna for the next year. One day, Dan posing as Anna in a cybersex chatroom manages to match her up with Larry Gray (Clive Owen), a British dermatologist, by convincing him to meet her at an aquarium, a place where Anna is known to go. The two meet, realize they were played, presume it was by Dan, and go on to lead a romantic relationship; Dan hopes this will deter his feelings for Anna and rekindle contentment with Alice, but alas, it only makes him more jealous of Anna.Closer concerns the kind of deception and deceit that comes into play when the characters begin meeting and interacting with one another. Eventually, Larry meets Alice, and Dan meets Larry, resulting in several different relationships brewing on many different levels of hostility and contempt. The characters are only seen in the same room once, as Nichols and writer Patrick Marber, who penned the play the film is based on, allow each individual relationship to take on its own level of singularity rather than lumping the characters together in one gigantic scene.Holding the film together are the performances of the actors at hand, each capitalizing off of a sole trait that makes them interesting and believably flawed. Alice, despite working as a stripper and willing to do pretty much anything for anyone, still radiates a childlike sense of whimsy and innocence, often playing like she doesn't know the entirety of what's occurring before her. Dan is restless, never settling down and always looking for something better, whilst, in the process, ruins the lives of the three other characters in the film. Anna has a neediness to her; a neediness to be loved and cared for, similar to Alice, that makes her not pitiable but relatable on a human level, mimicking our very desire to be appreciated and cherished. Finally, there's Larry, who replicates methods by using either blunt force, hungering for the truth in a more brash, vulgar manner than Dan, all while trying to remain civil even in the most unsavory circumstances.Consider the scene where Larry demands to know what Anna sees in Dan, particularly their love-making and how it is different or similar to their own intimacy. At first, Anna refrains from graphic details, but soon plays Larry's game of brutal honest, dishing out the details that he simultaneously does and doesn't want to know. This part hits close to home for me; while I want to know the details of things, I often wish I hadn't and dwell upon them for a considerable amount of time. Nichols and Marber question of whether or not it's better to know and dwell, for at least you have the knowledge of the situation, or be blissfully ignorant of the acts of your significant other and operate with a comforting sense of tunnel vision.At its core, however, this is an incredibly upsetting film, especially for those who like their films about love romantic and picturesque. Those who enjoy romance films treating love as a fallacy and akin to the kind of pretty pictures on post-cards shouldn't even bother picking this one up, unless they want to see any form of concrete reality. Closer may not be pretty, but it's brutally honest, and emphasizes the paradox of love's pleasure and pain, and works best if you know such feelings and what they can bring to a person. This is an incredibly underrated, compelling adult drama, cleanly executing character investment and motivations on top of etching in under-explored ideas about a topic that is heavily explored.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
What is love?,"This is old Mike Nichols at his best. The theme of love which he treated so many years ago with a dramatic approach in ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf"" comes back now in an apparently less dramatic way. What is love indeed and what is the meaning of the words ""I love you""? Are those who pronounce them always convinced that they are speaking the truth? Can a man (or a woman) love two women (or two men) at same time? All these questions arise in this movie in a continuous succession of encounters and dis-encounters in a permanent sway between the same four people whose characters are superbly acted by the four main performers. This is how love between men and women must be faced in modern life and I can't remember now any movie where this conflicting reality is presented in such an authentic way. The most important feature of this movie is made by the dialogues between the protagonists. The sentences are short, incisive, bright and intelligent. Through them we can learn all about the characters and penetrate deeply inside their souls and discover their feelings. It's true that love and all the feelings related to it maybe the same since the Antiquity till nowadays. But modern times with all the liberties they have brought give birth to more dramatic events because it's not true that freedom of love has curbed drama down. On the contrary the more freedom the more drama mainly interior drama because freedom of decision and choice brings more responsibility and the correlative anguish. One detail: the faked cybersex scene is hilarious and reveals much of what human soul hides in its deepness even in what concerns normal human beings. I think that this movie will enrich your knowledge of the modern human behaviour in respect to love between the sexes.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Worst... Movie... Ever,"Now, I know that proponents of this film are forming an opinion about what I have to say before I even say it. They're assuming that I didn't care for this film because there weren't any explosions, or there wasn't any gun-play, or because Ahhnold wasn't cast in the lead role. While I admit that my viewing preference circles around the horror/sci-if genre, the lack of violence in this film in no way contributed to my critique. In fact, when my girlfriend asked me to come see this film with her, I had quite the open mind. After all, half the film circles around sex, so what is there for a 24 year old male not to like. It was about fifteen minutes into the film, where Dan (Jude Law) and Anna (Julia Roberts) had their first encounter when I realized I had entered the ninth circle of hell.The foundation to creating a quality film of any genre, but particularly a dramatic one, is to make the watcher believe that he is truly part of the story, that the plot could take place on nearly any street in any city in any town. With horror and science fiction films, leeway is given due to the fantastic nature of the genre, but with drama, there is very little room for error.It is in this crucial element that the film fails miserably. It attempts to portray the gamut of human emotions, love, fear, anger, despair, that are put on display when one chooses to expose themselves to the world for the sake of the love of another. The premise is a bold one, and totally achievable, if the dialogue and plot had chosen not to get in the way and destroy it. While the actions of the characters seem believable per se, the way in which said actions are portrayed cross way over the line from dramatic into the melodramatic. The first encounter between Dan and Anna appears so rushed, so scripted, you don't believe anything that comes out of their mouths for the rest of the film. It's as if it were a poorly scripted reality T.V. show in which their true actions become overly exaggerated for the sole purpose of attempting to get a rise out of the audience. I imagine that proponents of this film also adored Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet, which could have been a beautiful love story, if the plot were allowed to cultivate over 48 months, not 48 hours.There are a few poignant places in the film where the dialogue, mostly that of Natalie Portman's character, forces one to step back and truly reflect on one's own existence, but the majority of the movie reminds me of oh so many daytime soap-operas, where the true lesson is lost amid an orgy of artificial emotions and unrealistic character development. It's truly sad to see such a bounty of super-star talent wasted on a film better suited for dish-washing housewives with nothing better to do on a Tuesday afternoon.KevinP.S.I'm sorry Julia, I still love you, even if Damien Rice can't sing.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Show don't tell:  so much babble, so little point","First of all, Clive Owen is a total babe, even in this infinitely mediocre movie, where he plays an infinitely mediocre perv. The actors were lost, the script was trite, the tension was forced, but there were moments when you said to yourself:""OK, this movie could almost sort of kind of maybe at some point turn into something kind of OK."" Unfortunately, this never happened...the dream was dead before it was born.If this movie had any point at all, it was this: Natalie Portman is hot. While this is incredibly enlightening, it doesn't really carry the movie. She plays a sassy American stripper, and couldn't possibly be more uncomfortable doing it. There is a scene where she struts around in a thong, but that just makes you feel like her god-parent, wanting nothing more than for her to cover up.Jude Law and Julia Roberts...they're famous...they are very famous...and rich...and we all know them...because they're famous...but that's just not enough. Roberts expelled her character in a constapational fit...she tried hard...darn hard...and there were moments when she actually made it, but for the most part she was just a famous woman in terrible pants, saying some lines and crying a bunch.When an actor can't even make you believe that he legitimately wears glasses, what does that say? I think it shows that some roles are just too big for Jude Law.Clive Owen was fantastic, but that was only because he was in the play ""Closer"" a few years back. He knew what his character was all about, and he had some inkling of a clue as to what the point of all that babble was. The audience and the rest of the actors are not privy to that information.What is the point of this movie? Why should we care about these people? What makes them interesting? What makes them do the things they do? This movie begins to answer these questions, and then falls short...way short. I don't know if I'm just a hopeless romantic, but was anyone else upset that no one died at the end?

can't take my eyes off you!,"This movie is based on a play. Though i have not seen this play, i am strongly convinced that it is a wonderful play. And the author must be very talented to create such an amazing piece of art!4 characters are crazy in love, that what they think. In fact, they are all wrong. They mistake love with something else, something passionate with kiss and sex but that something is definitely not love. Their mistakes depress all the four. People never be satisfied with what they have. People are greedy, never stop looking for more. That is so true with Dan and Anna. Dan has Alice, Anna has Larry. However, when being attracted to each other, Dan and Anna give up their respective lovers without any hesitation! They are selfish. I never like Julia Roberts, and i'm not interested in Anne.

Closer - pretty good.,"It's OK. Enjoyable. Engaging. It's not has great as awards shows would have you believe. The performances aren't bad. All the actors do the job. But ""theatre"" dialogue and scenes of non-action make ""great performances"" impossible. It would be good if there were films being made about adult relationships. There probably aren't any. The ""High Concept"" infantilism of post Lucas/Spielberg, among other things, means film is no longer used for pure drama. CLOSER may inspire someone to make a better film on the same theme.

What Originated on Stage Should Have Remained on Stage,"In movie form, ""Closer"" ended up being a bit of a turkey, but if nothing else it had the most attractive cast of 2004.Jude Law, Julia Roberts, Clive Owen and Natalie Portman take the reins of this four-hander about relationships and the nastiness they can bring out in those involved. It's a fairly grueling, unpleasant exercise -- none of the characters is especially likable or even sympathetic, so it's hard to muster up any energy to care about them and their relatively insignificant problems. On stage this probably worked, but in a movie, restricting the point of view to four people doesn't make a lot of sense in context. If they're so miserable with each other, can't they branch out and date any number of the millions of other people living in New York?Still, the acting is pretty impressive, especially from Clive Owen, as a truly vile character, and Natalie Portman, sexy and enigmatic.Grade: C+",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

However, there were too many unbelievable moments to make this film any more than a stylish accessory. 3/4 times in the film, someone did/said something that would never happen in real life. These moments jarred and in so doing they ruined the credibility of the whole film. The name of the Natalie Portman character? Clive Owen's first conversation with the Natalie Portman character? Natalie's last action in the film? I'm a fan of Patrick Marber but I felt that events were thrown in just because they looked clever. The overall effect was that this was a contrived film.

Closer...a decent movie with extraordinary performances,"I hate to be unoriginal and jump on the recently occurring Clive Owen bandwagon..but after seeing this film I am really hooked on the guy.

I left the theater simply hating Roberts and Law and I respect them more for it. Clive Owen and Natalie Portman, on the other hand, were extraordinary.Even when their characters failed to be likable in the traditional sense, they won my heart with their complexity,sincerity, and wit. Clive Owen's performance is a treat for audiences who have long been awaiting something that adequately displays his talent. I've always been under the impression that Natalie Portman was over-rated (esp. after she was dubbed by some as the next Audrey Hepburn) while I still think that she is no Hepburn, I am willing to admit that she has talent. Sure the screenplay was often over the top and unrealistic, but Closer is entertaining and well worth seeing despite its faults.

It does not stay at the 'and they were happy ever after' but goes into all the dirty details, excitement, depression, perversion, everything bluntly exposed.In my opinion, despite the four characters, they are only two different sides of the same couple; on one hand, the tough couple - who follows their desires, does not hesitate in making compromises, shouts and bites, bleeds and fights but moves on, and the weak couple - who dreams, who hesitates in every decision, who weeps and feels remorse about everything.I loved how each and every one of the actors played his/her part, and in particular, I loved Natalie Portman, who's grown into such a beautiful and charming woman, still keeping a lot of innocence in her face/eyes.You wanna see a different story about what pretty much any couple goes through, don't hesitate to watch it all the way, it's worth it!",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
A Closer Look at Alice,"Alice, an American stripper in London, is a selling point of this movie. Credit should be given to not only her daring incorporation of nudity into purity, but also the mystery she brings about.Her identity alone is so mysterious that it is not until the movie draws to its end when we could know that her real name is Jane Rachel – Alice Ayres is the pseudonym she adopted from one of the tiles she saw in Postman's Park. In fact, Alice accepts her identity as not quite human for any of the other characters, but as an object so that others could benefit. She was the subject of Dan's book, the model for Anna's photography project and the stripper for Larry.[1]All the characters have a tense relationship with truth—only Alice is ""not passionate about veracity.""[2] In real life, she uses her pseudonym, Alice Ayres, while in the strip club she uses her real name, Jane Rachel. She does not, from beginning to end, reveal her identity to Dan, the man she loves deeply, but exposes everything, including her body, to Larry, the man she has no feeling for. Her inability to deal with the truth causes her to leave Dan at the end.[3]Still, Alice remains the most believable character. As Portman, the actress who played Alice, points out, ""Alice is really alone when she comes to London, so she makes up her entire world, completely creates herself. Yet, she also has this childlike side. She's really honest and direct in her feelings, which distinguishes her from the other characters. So though she's lying about her persona, she's the most direct, honest character in the film.""[4]The last scene echoes the opening, in which Alice is walking down the street, and strikes our curiosity about her outcome since she, once again, continues walking when the red light is on. According to the play, from which this movie was adapted, Alice dies in an accident, and Dan summons Anna and Larry to Postman's Park to remember her. It is at this point that Dan, Anna and Larry realize that they have been eluding themselves for four years, and that it was Alice that, in a roundabout way, unified them. She helped them find their identities because she herself had none.[5] It is indicated in the movie, nonetheless, that Alice will die in the end. On the tile which Alice saw at the beginning of the movie, it was written as follows: Alice Ayres, Daughter of a Bricklayer's Labourer, Who by Intrepid Conduct Saved 3 Children from a Burning House in Union Street Borough at the Cost of Her Own Young Life. It can be assumed, therefore, that the other three characters might be the ""3 Children"", and that Alice might die for them.References [1] Iris. www.goodreads.com/book/show/399138.Closer Retrieved 26 April 2009.

Strong story  of vulnerable Characters,"CLOSER is a strong story of 'weak' characters, an honest tale of dishonesty, a fiction of 'almost-real' characters. Sounds paradoxical but its a fact. Movie revolves around four characters Dan - A writer/journalist (Jude Law), Anna - A photographer divorceé (Julia Roberts), Larry - A dermatologists (Cliver Owen) and Alice - A Stripper (Natalie Portman). The movie is all about passions, love, lust, sex, obsession, infidelity and life. Well, it seems that you wonder whether this is a Mike Nicholas-movie or Zalaman King-movie? Well, don't worry. This is an absolutely beautiful movie of soft human emotions and their vulnerability.The movie is an example of directorial excellence. It is well-paced, well-written and brilliantly-executed. There are only four characters and surprisingly all four have equal space to grow and get noticed. The script (Patrick Marber) is the strongest aspect of the movie. Probably because it is based on a play by the same writer. The movie proceeds in a fast but enjoyable rhythm. The movie sets an example for all youngsters who aspire to take up movie direction as their passion of life. ( For example, Jude Law is seen crying with same facial expressions and intensity in Alfie also, but his tears look much more convincing in this movie).So far as performances are concerned, Jude Law and Julia Roberts are wonderful. Especially Julia Roberts has done an excellent underplayed character, which only an actress of her maturity can do. However, their lesser known counterparts, Owen and Portman, walk away with louder applause. Owen is simply superb as a simple but overreacting and obsessed husband. Natalie Portman portrays her difficult character with an astonishing ease. She has all it would take to dominate the silver screen for the next decade.The movie reaches near perfection, in terms of performances, stories and dialogues. However, it depends heavily on dialogues (probably because it is based on a play). Hence, it involves the viewer mentally in the process of development of the storyline. The characters and story are so dangerously close to reality that it is difficult not to get provoked and engulfed in thoughts. So, if you are a university student, and want to watch it with a view to getting some relaxation after exams, don't watch closer. For that we have 'Hitch'........",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Most Excellent Surprise,"Being partial to ""talky dramas"", I wondered why I had somehow missed this one (on Broadway as well a few years back). Perhaps I balked on the film as I was not, frankly, not a major Julia Roberts fan (although quite intrigued by the talented male leads). Gave this a try tonite and, to my delight, totally engrossed. And surely this the following statement is represents the view of a tiny minority --- Julia Roberts has never been better. Nuanced, real, adult, bravo Ms. Roberts!Mike Nichols directing shall we say a new Millennium spin-off of ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf"", all these years later, and exquisitely well. One of the rare post-age 60 directors in film history to still have that touch (rival Clint Eastwood another).Jude Law and Clive Owen delivered what I had hoped for, three dimensional portrayals of real people. They are among my favorite performers (the latter would have been a swell James Bond). Natalie Portman really good, filling-out a quartet that merits lots of praise.With all the absurd remakes crowding the screen, the one-note violence and puerile humor, the absurdly bloated ""tentpoles"" crowding the screen, how refreshing, how grand to see a film about four well fleshed out characters, flawed, annoying, sympathetic, foolish ... I rate this a 9 of 10.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Intense,"Wonderfully acted and intensely psychological, this is the type of film that is meant to be viewed more than once. The film proves to be the most realistic depiction of adult relationships that I have ever seen on the screen. There is no simple explanation for their problems and emotions, the characters and the plot are both extremely complex. Closer's presentation of realistic and highly conflicted characters reminds me a lot of those in Tennessee Williams's Streetcar Name Desire. If you are in the mood for a film that really makes you think and gives you something to reflect back on later then I would highly recommend this film to you.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Dreadful, dreadful, dreadful","If ever a movie was less than the sum of its parts, it's ""Closer"".Talky, boring, unconvincing, unpleasant, unwatchable.The supposed plot, about four ""adults"" (in chronological years if not behavior), revolves around revolving relationships and revolting musical beds as these narcissists lie, abuse, ignore, adore, desert, rejoin, and revile each other in turn.Aside from the film's suffering from filmed-stage-play-disease (people talk too much and do too little), what they do say is uninteresting and unappealing. Every word, action, attitude, decision and resolution of each character comes across exactly as a plot device, not something that real human beings would say, think, do, or believe.Please, please watch something else.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
Brave choices make good actors into great actors.,"Much has been said about this sensitive four-hander. To work with Mike Nichols must have a lot to do with it, but the courage shown by Portman and Owen in accepting very difficult roles will pay dividends. Great acting has much to do with taking on roles that will test and challenge. Both Portman and Owen have huge talents yet I have never seen either stretched this far. They both were brilliant. They will be better for this and it will give them courage to accept future, difficult roles like these, so totally against type. Law and Roberts were in more comfortable territory and obliged well. Roberts devours the lens with her great beauty. Actually, I find her to be so beautiful it really is huge distraction from what's going on! The great virtuoso performances of the past from actors such as Brando and Olivier have all been hugely difficult roles but the great actor has the guts to tale on the role and make it real and truthful. How long did Olivier think about how he was going to play Richard or Archie Rice? Both very difficult roles that many lesser lights would avoid because of the degree of difficulty involved. Portman and Owen are going to be bigtime if they keep it up. On a lighter note,Miss Portman's world class callypygean charm was pretty sensational.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Solid, Emotionally Intense Film","This movie was, in my opinion, one of the year's best films. The acting was incredible and completely engrossing. I am partial to Natalie Portman and Clive Owen, but I really dislike Julia Roberts, so I figure it balances out. The editing did exactly what it needed to, no more and no less. It was nothing to get excited about but it aided in the film's pace which is exactly what it should have done. The directing made it easy to see that this film was a stage production first. It was translated well onto celluloid, more than likely due to the fact that Mike Nichols directed both incarnations of the story. It is disheartening that the academy all but forgot about this film (despite the Supporting actor/actress categories). There is no doubt that it deserved Best Picture, Editing, and Director nominations that Ray got. The only negatives I found with this film was that it dragged in some places and fell victim to the overly emotional virus in one or two scenes. If you aren't opposed to either of these things, do yourself a favor and see this film.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Real, a bit painful","Many people don't like this movie because of its sexual explicitness, and its making sex and love into a ""dirty hurtful thing"". Sex and love can be a dirty, hurtful thing, though...So many movies in Hollywood make love and relationships an ideal, wonderful thing, which it is if it's healthy...There are good and immature people who can get caught up in bad relationships with people who aren't good for them, and this movie explores that. Just because you have been so lucky as to have good relationships throughout your life doesn't mean you can't or shouldn't look at the other side of relationships that other people go through. Have some empathy. Do you want to end up like this? No. Should people be this way? Ideally, no. But there are many, many people around the world who have affairs, have been cheated on, who have cheated, who have been left and hurt, and that is what this movie is about, so don't expect anything else. That said, it has obviously stirred up many love/hate reactions and is powerful.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
brutally honest,"The usual antics for romantic dramas are stripped off from this movie.Personally, I think it takes real experience with the dynamics of relationship and affairs to really appreciate the plot and characters.It is quaint, honest and anyone can relate at some point to the characters. I highly commend Natalie and Owen for their brilliant performance. I believe it was a great display of Portman's maturity on the silver screen. She certainly now has the edge to make it to greater lead roles. If you watched this film and got confused in the midst of their bickering, i strongly advise that you watch it again, open your mind and let it just sink.It'll be one of the best dramas you'll ever see..",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Slow and boring movie,"Closer is a film that tries to convey an interesting idea, but in my view it doesn't work, boring and boring film, too slow in scenes that could be more objective, even though the film takes an hour and forty it seems that it takes forever to go through each scene. The only good point of this movie is that it has good performances, mainly by Jude Law and Julia Roberts, in my view Natalie Portaman's performance is ok, looking a little forced at times and the same as Clive Owen. My final grade is 4, it just didn't get 0 because of the good performances, because otherwise the movie is terrible.",4.0,Anonymous,Romance
something I want to say about the movie,"In this movie, complicated plot and psychological actions are more worthwhile to write about than the stars' acting or something else. Dan is a key character; almost everything is caused by him or his action, and it is his shortcomings that lead to misery. He is conservative, while he desires adventure; he wants to be loved ,but when he is loved he loses his head; women tolerate his shortcomings, fascinated by his pretty face, while he innocently thinks his lover has to be perfect. Compared with previous characters Jude Law rolled, Dan is more practical, more real. The scene Dan cries with humiliation in front of Larry, his romanticism and immaturity of love have been embodied completely.Larry may be the most snobbish one among the four. The scene he chatters with Dan playing as Anna on line shows his indecency inside. He knows little about love except for sex and occupancy.Alice is a little demon with an angel's face.At the beginning she says she's kind of gypsy,so no wonder in the end she walks in the crowd wildly, caring about men's erotic sights. It's hard for me to believe she truly falls in love with Dan. At last ,she lies in bed and suddenly tells Dan that she doesn't love him any more from that second.Love is not a kind of redemption; it is simply a relationship.Both Alice and Dan are searching in the street ,waiting for the love at the first sight, and so are many people; while their results are often not good. It seems not so good to be a romanticist on love, for the romance on purpose will be disappointing.In the end, the soft music is on again, ""I can't keep my eyes off youI can't keep my mind off you""Everyone has an ideal about his or her love, but reality is reality.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
A Fascinating Look At Relationships,"30 December 2004. This relational drama offers up a continuing evolution of movies revealing a more cynical but valuable look into relationships. Julia Roberts, Natalie Portman, Jude Law, and Clive Owen all provide different personalities on screen and give the audience a rich experience into the levels of love and torment. This movie operates on a number of different levels and gives its audience both cynical omens for dispair as well as hopeful signs for optimism - a little for everyone. This movie avoids the typical, stereotypical ending and leaves the audience all the more educated and developed as a result. The universal male striving for love and sexual validation along with a female's desire for support and commitment are all on display in this version of intimate triangles and rectangles. Of deceit and honesty, of open communication and avoidance and secrecy, of impulse and spontaneity, of salvation and betrayal. All the emotions are on display in this movie and the audience is the better for it. Nine of out Ten Stars.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Cavemen in Kenneth Coles and the women who love them,"Take two ur-neurotic Brit yuppies, offer no indication as to why they are so squirrelly, and tie them with women who are more or less cyphers, and you have the basis for ""Closer."" Get some terrific actors to play them, and you've got a hit on your hands. That box office popularity is something I can't understand. I suffered through this film--and at $10 a pop the suffering was excruciating --because I think nobody in life--NOBODY--is as shallow as are these four. If they were being menaced by a werewolf, I could understand it. Prey do not need their characters developed. But these four (okay, maybe the Julia Roberts character is two-dimensional) are so tissue thin that I stopped caring about them in the first 10 minutes. Yes, there are some powerful individual scenes--and several with Natalie Portman are remarkably vibrant--but these don't add up to a movie, any more than a series of quirky monologues add up to a play.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
Closer,"Closer is the story of four people living in London. Alice (Natalie Portman) is a wild young woman with red hair when we first see her. She meets Dan (Jude Law) an obituary writer who wants to be a novelist, but his books turns out to be a flop. Dan and Alice live together, but Dan becomes infatuated with photographer Anna (Julia Roberts). Anna seemingly wants nothing to do with the young writer and Dan, in the weirdest way imaginable, introduces Anna to Larry (Clive Owen). Eventually Anna and Larry marry but things soon get complicated.Closer is an anomaly of a film to me because I found myself loving it while loathing it at the same time. The dialogue is way too sexual for most of the duration of the film, yet the story and the acting make it well worth watching. Closer was a play before it was a movie and Owen originally played the character Law plays in the film version. I would recommend fans of Mike Nichols give this one a watch as well as fans of Natalie Portman, who is clearly the stand out of the four stars.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Loved it/Hated it,"Mike Nichols has caught lightning in a bottle with this baby, a dark twist about romance-gone-wrong which, on a more personal level, I will always approach with some ambivalence. This gripping epic involves Clive Owen, Julia Roberts, Jude Law and Natalie Portman all over each other over a long period of years during which they love, hate, cheat and make up (not particularly in that order). It's one of those films that makes you think long and hard about you life and the relationships you experience along the way. I also can't help but feel that the conversation I had with my Ex Girlfriend after watching this together led to our eventual break-up. Oh well.(Note: don't miss the magnificent song ""The Blower's Daughter"" by Damien Rice from Closer's soundtrack. Such a sad, touching song).",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

Make sure to have a movie-enthusiast to discus this film's plot with after wards, or ells it is very confusing. however, the confusing elements easily vanishes caused by the brilliant acting! Mind Clive Owen- phenomenal! (Which he also has been Oscar nominated for:)He just surprised me. I did not expect him to be THAT good after having seen KING ARTHUR. I just thought that he was this soft man- but no! Besides it is full of gorgeous scenes and heavy dialogs. I can only recommend Closer. A well-written screenplay which does- that the characters manages to carry the story through a super confusing and over psychological plot. It really settles how certain elements really just destroys your life, if you let them control everything; such as as desire, cheating, weakness and of course love. Just go watch it- and drool!",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Utterly disappointing!,"This film made my skin crawl a little bit - and it wasn't just the language, the extremely sex-focused themes and the lack of humanity in the characters, it was the lack of a potential that could've been. Because I thought it did have potential - before I actually watched it.The film is filled with great performances of all the four stars - but who really cares, when you yourself (the viewer) actually don't care anyway? And I've seen many wonderful films with very unsympathetic protagonists before, but this? No thanks!Its filled to the core of sex - and actually its quite disgusting when you think about it. Yes, sex is a very concrete thing in our daily lives, but my god, this film didn't capture real-life sex, the phenomena of it or sexuality in its real form.The potential of this film is very present at times, but it just feels like it throws itself out the window. It left a bad taste in my mouth, and it just felt like it was time wasted for me, as a viewer, and time wasted of the great actors themselves.And the director, Mike Nichols - a late director of a great film like The Graduate - was lacking in his way of showing us something poignant and interesting.The film was colourless and flavourless (perhaps some of the characters would object...!) and the texture of this matter just fell flat.Two out of ten, can't recommend.",2.0,Anonymous,Romance
If you live in the Bible belt stay home,"Many people have complained about the graphic nature of this film. While i will admit, the language is vulgar and obscene, the movie ratings system warns of it. Coming from a very conservative area i would recommend if you are easily offended by language and conversations that are very sexually graphic, you should stay home.That said, the film was extremely well made, with terrific performances by the whole cast. Natalie Portman really proves herself to be a terrific actress in this film, and combined with last year's Garden State she has really grown into a very mature, very talented actress, and i don't think the next Star Wars will be able to ruin that. Julia Roberts also delivers a strong performance, as a very un-Julia character. Normally i do not like her work because she doesn't seem to play different characters, but in this film she definitely broke my expectations. On to the men, Jude law and Clive Owen. Both delivered amazing performances. I have seen a lot of both men's films and i truly think this one may be the highlight of both's careers thus far. Mike Nichols follows up Angels in America with another well made film.

Love and passion; the odds of it all,"I'll stipulate the following review by saying that many of mine fall into a simple category: humor intended to review the dark, ridiculously humorous side of human nature. However, I feel an obligation, possibly based on my own history, or the director's beautiful portrayal of such events, to give a far more honest approach to what I viewed. That given, perhaps, for once, people will find such a review helpful. I was moved, and I hope many of you experience this movie with a similar moving experience.Closer defines the confusing times we deal with in terms of story-book romantic endings and the reality of how love comes to be. We all (optimistically) envision love that is true, immediate, and timeless. Yet, we get a glimpse of reality here; those who believe in love, at various moments in time, only to discover much of themselves consistently changing, both in terms of lovers, and how they define love. Love is clearly the topic of interest, but who's love? And which lovers? This question parallels a more common reality, one in which we may be less realistic about perceiving, yet still exists.The consistent romantic interludes are superb, perhaps only trumpeted by the disturbing lack of romance by those engaged in such interludes. Our own safety in those we allow to get close to us being of key issue. I could continue, but I'd rather allow this to be a prelude to inspire those both questionable and hopeful of relationships to view the movie. Enjoy, both in terms of the characters, and the stories they tell. This is a movie both inspiring and dismaying, but worth seeing. The current state of your love life may determine your eventual perception. Regardless, I hope you find both this review and the movie a worthwhile event.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
For those who choose their movies by the Oscars,"While I am not inclined to make negative comments, in the interest of those who value their time, I must say that both my wife and I feel we wasted ours with this movie. In the movie at an art gallery, one of the characters comments about how one is not supposed to question the art. Likewise, it seems most reviews here are by the 'art critics' of the movie-going audience. Praise for 'intelligent dialog' and depth seem hollow. This film, like a number of the other highly acclaimed productions that seem more about what is trendy rather than what is substance, seems to exist primarily as a 'teaser'. It is a long, quirky excursion of continual suggestiveness. There are no 'sex scenes' as would be generally referred to, rather, the movie spends a lot of time talking about truth, relationships, and the intimate, specific details of unseen sexual acts repeated for the voyeuristic satisfaction of the two male leads. I'm sure many will want to point to the 'brilliance' of using characters so convinced of their understanding and devotion to the best of relationship values while constantly repeating failure after failure of each of those same values. Perhaps urine in a jar and monkeys throwing paint on canvas does make art--if so, this is your film. If not, don't bother. Society and each of us can, of course, use the benefit of entertainment to reflect us and to reflect on. However, lately that seems to mean find the lowest common denominators, portray that they are both uniform and accurate in describing our worth, and then repeat the same format of failures in a time line that is broken, jumbled and asynchronous and you have what will surely bring Oscar nominations and high praise as another brilliant work of art from Hollywood. And having recently seen ""11:14"" on DVD with Patrick Swayze reduced to mockery of himself, I should guess that Julia Roberts presence in a movie is no longer an indication of quality.

Other than that, ugh. Two men sexting online (with only one realizing it's two men), in an exchange full of the crudest and most juvenile proposals?Erotic? Nope. Creepy? Oh, yeah. Interesting? Nope. This whole movie seemed like it was written by a 14-year-old boy, with that level of innuendo and supposed shock value.And at NO time did I believe anyone's reasons for doing what they did, mainly because they would immediately in the next scene completely violate their earlier motives.And not for any good reason, either. The only rule seemed to be ""PLOT"". The author wanted the characters to do things, so they did them, whether or not this made any sense at all.The best part of the unpleasant experience was that I didn't realize it was directed by Mike Nichols until it was over, so I wasn't carrying that extra disappointment the whole time.When I saw the closing credits, however, I was (to use a Britishism) gob-smacked.Ugh, I say, ugh.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
"A meditation on insecurity, desire, the meaning of compromise and the relativity of truth within human relationships","An intelligent and difficult film 'Closer' asks questions, and the audience chooses whether to investigate what is presented.There are no easy answers and none are offered.My guess is that most people would rather dismiss the film than dwell on the very uncomfortable issues presented; after all reflection is very hard work and we are mostly not used to it.Will total honesty always destroy relationshipsWill sexual jealousy always destroy relationshipsWhat stops us acting on our impulsive desires; is it our 'moral rectitude' or our fear of the consequencesHow can we live a compromise and still be true to ourselvesWhat would a win-win compromise look like in the context of a relationshipIf we have lied can we still trust that someone else is telling us the truthAre we stuck in a relationship because our fear of the unknown is greater than our present unhappinessHow great is our need for control in a relationship or do we need another to control usI noticed that it was the men who needed to know every detail of the so-called 'truth'.

"One of the year's best, a must-see, entertaining and harrowing","""Closer"" is a character study looking closely  like through a magnifying glass  at the dishonesty of human nature. Its only four characters are real. These are people. Adjectives like ""convincing"" or ""believable"" aren't applicable here because they are irrelevant...whether these are actors or not, ""Closer"" is a look at a few years in the lives of four very real people. They are four fierce, empathy-less, angry, sad, charming, and sometimes even sick people, but they are still people, and not mere characters in a movie. When the film ends their problems are not solved, their lives will still continue the way it does through the film, because it is a film on life, and life doesn't end until death, and this isn't about the people's deaths.Dan (Jude Law) is a pretty bad-boy wannabe English writer who goes through his days pretending to have a dark side. Anna (Julia Roberts) is a classy photographer who takes seemingly artistic photos of strangers that look personal but only hide the fact that they are, indeed, strangers. Alice (Natalie Portman) is a dark free spirit who is both cynical and naive. Larry (Clive Owen) is a dermatologist who fuses an innocent boyish charm with fierce anger and hatred for other human beings. All four can be nasty, or lovable. They have traits. People.Dan meets Alice on the street. They engage in a flirtation, speaking about themselves, attracted. They become partners, live together for a year or so, Dan writes a book based on her. They appear to be in love, but really it is about how they each meet the other's required needs.Then Dan finds someone who will meet his needs more sufficiently. Anna, the photographer, taking his picture for the jacket of his book. Anna likes him, but doesn't want to be a ""thief"". Still, she gives in and can't help but kiss him. She thinks to remain strong, though, and rejects him.Retaliating to the rejection, Dan signs onto a dirty internet chat room, posing as Anna, and sets up a meeting with Larry. Larry comes to the London aquarium Anna so often visits, and finds the real Anna there. He sits down beside her and immediately sets off a bunch of piggish, chauvinistic sexual comments. She's put off by him, but not as much as she should be, and when they both realize his dilemma she instantly forgives him. They go for a walk. Larry's gears switch instantly from obnoxious pervert to boyish charmer, and we, along with Anna, start to like him.And so the movie is set up, and things happen from here on in, not as predictable as you might think. The four characters interact, sometimes one-on-one, sometimes in threesomes, never all four at once. The movie has that 'play feel'. Sometimes that feel doesn't work (""Mister Roberts"" for example) but sometimes it works perfectly. The latter applies here. We feel like we have stepped into the peoples' lives, the same feeling we usually get from a good play.The screenplay was adapted by Patrick Marber from his own play, and it is directed by Mike Nichols. These two really know how to set up a movie. An Oscar for both of them would be an understatement. All of the aspects  mostly acting and writing  piece together to make the perfect tone for the film. Everything justfits. The film editing is commendable too, like a scene where both couples are breaking up, and it inter-cuts between them. Another brilliant move was to save Jude Law and Clive Owen's meeting until a climactic later scene, because these two are the driving chauvinist males of the movie, and anything less significant wouldn't do them justice.This is an ensemble piece. Not in the usual ""ensemble piece"" way  meaning that there are many famous faces jammed in the same shot  but meaning that all of the cast (which here is only four) play off each other perfectly. There is romantic, angry, sexual, sad, charming and sympathetic chemistry firing between them at all times; the actors have developed an actual relationship with each other that sort of resonates in the film.Natalie Portman is magical in this movie. She delivers one of the best female performances of the year, playing a beautiful, spunky character that ambiguously has the odds on her side. We don't often her side of things, but when we do, it's a shocker. She deserved the Golden Globe she won and would deserve the Oscar (I place only Virginia Madsen before her).Clive Owen proves his talent here, and proves that he is one of the most intriguing actors working today. He is stunningly able to shift from nasty to charming to perverted without seeming to be over (or under) acting, out of character or incapable. He is very capable. He grabs a hold of the audience in his scenes and doesn't let go until he's off-screen.It is because of the amazing talent and presence of Portman and Owen that we sort of lose focus on Jude Law and Julia Roberts, who both do terrific jobs. Jude Law raises the specter on versatility here; I suggest you watch this with ""Cold Mountain"" and ""The Talented Mr. Ripley"" to drink in what this guy can do. Roberts is movie-star, and being one, subtlety is usually not present in her performances, but here it blooms. She uses it to suggest that her character is giving way to her desires, letting go of any morals or ethics. It's a touching, tragic performance. Possibly her best.Now, the unabashed sexual dialogue may put off a few, but this is not a movie that glorifies sex, not by far. So watch it, no matter if you're a conservative or liberal, and study the values of empathy, honesty and the wisdom to not make the same mistakes twice.8.5/10",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

The dialogue is very very clever, and despite its unrealistic airs, it works. But because of its rhythm and pace, which is powerful nonetheless, it still seems like a play. One should not see a movie and be reminded of watching a play, because suddenly the fact that it's a movie becomes meaningless. The oneness of an individual creative medium, no matter how much it may have in common with another, is very important to maintain, because it is nothing without its continuous substantiation and comprehension in the world, and the enjoyment of it is so extremely beautiful and impactful because it is full of inherited memories and influences of the creation and development of it.Despite this, Closer is a very moving story exploding with incredible acting from its petit cast, Mike Nichols again drawing out the very best from each of his actors. His main achievement in directing this film is his treatment of his actors, whose power and consumption in their roles are so unremittingly personal portrayals that the unmistakable theatricality hardly deters them at all, which is why it is not an indefensible flaw.Marber's characters are so deeply realized that they have the prevailing effect of truly real people, whose sexual experience has given them a collective conscious which affects the mature and wise emotional atmosphere of the movie, physicalized by the staggering current that connects these four people. Likewise, this film is a very emotional experience that moves you and makes life clearer for you, however much experience with sex and relationships you may have.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Lies, truth, deceit, guilt, they're all the same thing","This was a great movie, i just watched it for the 2nd time. Hauntingly romantic, but at the same time it is pure lust. Major themes in this movie are lies and truth, cowardice, guilt, etc. While watching this, at times i feel like love is all that matters and then at other times it's about compromise and adapting to one person. Not sure really what to say, you hafta go see the movie for yourself. Performance-wise, it was great. Personally i've never been able to identify female acting talent, but Natalie Portman proves me wrong. She gives the greatest female performance ever given, in my eyes. Idk who smited her at the Oscars, but whoever it was didn't deserve it, she did. Jude Law & Roberts were good, but Clive Owen was much better. He perfected his part. Basically, if you like feeling and like being moved and touched by films, go see this. It makes you think about life and makes you want to explore it.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
A Piece of Crap,"Caught this unfortunate piece of crap film on TV the other day. I thought these types of pretentious exercises in excessive yakking and cursing went bye-bye a long time ago in film trends, but maybe I've just been staying away from any that smell remotely like this. There was not one real, true note of emotion or story in this hideous film. People don't talk like this, they don't act like this - why, people like this just don't exist - thankfully. I would have to go into hiding if the world were inhabited by stupid, self-centered, gross characters like these.Julia Roberts - I'm not even a fan and I think this is beneath you. Oh, and Natalie Portman? Girl, please give it up - you are an embarrassment as an ""actress"" - even in a crass vehicle like this. Ewww. Jude Law? You are so boring, dude. The only reason I kept watching was Clive Owen - who takes cringeworthy lines and actually puts some feeling in them. Charismatic. I'll be watching you Clive.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
Strangely Compelling Drama,"This interesting drama is clever in that it can draw you into the stories and relationships between the four main characters purely through some amazing dialogue, some intense sexual chemistry, and through an incredible cast. It is also very unpredictable in comparison to many other films in the romantic genre, and for this, Closer deserves more recognition than your average romance film.The film focuses on four characters. Alice (Portman, in arguably her best role to date), Dan (Law), Anna (Roberts) and Larry (Owen). After a series of chance encounters, the two principle relationships are developed. These are between Alice and Dan, the other between Anna and Larry. However, this twisted tale of lust, betrayal, deception and second chances takes a violent turn when Dan embarks on an affair with Anna and breaks off his relationship with Alice, with some revealing consequences that become important as the film goes on.Portman gives a stellar performance as the teasing, yet highly emotional Alice, and Owen gives an equally good performance as the tactically minded Larry, who will engage anyone in a battle of wits, with interesting results. But, this isn't to say that Law and Roberts' performances aren't good, they are just simply outperformed. The result is some incredibly intense sexual chemistry, which is just begging to be released. You decide which of these types of scenes you'll find as the most arousing.Told through a succession of shifts in time, fused with flashbacks that develop the situations, perfectly reflects how life isn't always straightforward, but sometimes, if you blink, you will miss it. This can be described as a psychological drama in the way that the relationships heat up through the amazingly intense scenes, and how people's minds do tend to lose proportionality when placed into a situation that has never previously been dealt with or dreamt of. But, the most interesting thing about this film is how it can deal quite a lot of arousal, even though there isn't any truly graphic/visual depiction of sex in the entire film.Whatever your views on romantic/sexual films, this should interest with how destructive inter-related lives can be, and how far off the path of morality it can take us, and for anybody who can see any part of themselves in any of the four characters, they can fully appreciate the sharp turns life has, and how accurately the consequences of this are conveyed in the tumultuous relationships this film depicts.A wonderful film, but beaten at the Oscars by a Million Dollar Baby. 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Real love?,"Closer is possibly the most accurate and realistic depiction of modern love. The notion and true value of love in today's context is lost among a sea of infidelity, deception, lust, betrayal, jealously, cynicism, technology and vindication.Despite being set in slightly surreal environments such as a photo exhibition and strip clubs, the writers and actors have successfully conveyed the emotions that run through typically dysfunctional relationships. In the end, the people involved in the web are either very certain of their own feelings finally or are so overwhelmed with rage that they become vindictive. The movie also explores the line between truth and lie; the difference each makes to a relationship and the consequence one has to bear for his/her actions.Julia Roberts hasn't got much for her role to begin with, but she shows a certain delicateness, straddling between guilt and liberty with her role that makes a performance that is sufficiently pleasurable. Natalie Portman is stunning with middling traces of girlish vulnerability and womanly salacity. Jude Law packs both a cold yet emotive performance as a cheating boyfriend and later a desperate man stuck nowhere in both relationships. A performance good enough to warrant for an Oscar nod (but none sadly). The most powerful performance must come from Clive Owen who starred in the original play. He's the one who's drawn into a destructive relationship with Roberts and turns sinister when trying to win her back through a series of confrontations and psychological manoeuvers. All in all, a stellar cast and choice performances. (PS: Do check out the cybersex chat between Owen and Law) So, is love lost really lost? Is the sudden change of hearts actually beyond one's reasonable control? Find out in Closer, then again you might never actually.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Clive and Julia and Jude and Natalie,"Oscar Wilde was right when he said, ""There are two great tragedies in life. One is not getting what you want, and the other is getting it."" Mike Nichols' well crafted film highlights both tragedies with an unflinching eye. Nichols clearly knows a little something about both films and relationships, and he turns it loose here with a vengeance. This film seems to derail your expectations at every turn, yet he keeps it both believable and true. Desire and its consequences ramble through the lives of this foursome in modern London. Are we in control of our emotions and desires, or do they control us? Do we consider the consequences of our actions or blindly go after what we want? Where does happiness lie? And where is that line that past which you can never get back from once crossed?",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
An Accurate Reflection of the Human Condition,"The depiction of human depravity at its worse, this film affronts one with four characters, so horribly life-like, who continuously slip on an unromantic landslide. This film practically portrays what occurs when a group of individuals continue to pursue their own interests, defeating any form of social altruism whatsoever. One may be disgusted by the unveiled qualities of man and woman in this film, but in reality the movie is really just a illustration of humanity in pursuit of its most natural inclinations (the pursuit of the most 'apparent good' over and over again). What may disgust people isn't the choices these four characters make, but the reflection of some or all of the stories in the film within one's own life. Our attempt to shroud our past mistakes in the romantic scheme of things is shattered with 108 minutes of pure self-interest.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
The thing of it is...,"I'm not sure what I expected from this movie. I've always been a fan of Julia Roberts but never because I thought that she was a great actress. I simply trusted her to be likable and deliver a watchable, cookie-cutter performance. I think Natalie Portman is a timeless beauty, a formidable actress who reminds me more and more of Audrey Hepburn. She is an old soul with a childlike quality that draws you into her. Clive Owen is perfect. He is handsome, rugged, masculine, and a wonderful actor. Jude Law I have never liked. The first movie that I saw him in, The Talented Mr. Ripley, solidified my critical opinion of him. And yes, I have seen his other movies, I ""heart"" Huckabee, etc. He was OK in them, tolerable, but nothing more than that.This movie changes my opinion of all of them. It forces all of these actors to deliver performances that every other actor should be jealous of. They reached someplace very deep, dark and real and in turn we are left emotion so raw that it feels like you are watching a stage play. They make demands of themselves and on each other that makes me believe that they truly understand. Often I am left empty after watching these beautiful Hollywood personas ""act"" a role that I know they cannot relate to. The writing in this movie/play is so good that no matter your station in life or lack of experience with the drama and passion that unfolds on the screen before you, you cannot help but believe that they get it. All four of them understand the essential theme of the movie and use their character to portray that understanding.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
When real life starts imitating art..,"Just watched this movie, and I must say, the movie is full of truths that I thought I would never see in a film, its a fresh diversion from stories that tries too much, movies that tries to portray a grander version of life as it really is, when life is really cruel, gray and full of lies and deceit. Natalie and Julia's performances were flawless, as with Jude and Clive's compelling dialogues -- rings true to life, as if one would have just said them, just days ago in normal everyday life, this film is by no means a happy film, but in essence it is the very search for happiness itself, or is it contentment?, once found, how one will sacrifice and compromise for it, and yet break from it, and the truth, although we plainly see it, will always hurt, when said.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
What a movie,"I saw Closer on the day it was released and following that day I summoned as many people as I could to see this film. The film relies heavily on its four characters whom as actors all have great strength in the film. Clive Owen gives a fantastic and seemingly effortless performance and proved to the American market that he is an actor that we should all be taking note of. Julia Roberts stunned me. It was wonderful to see her in a role with zero likability and to watch her go head on into it fearlessly. I heard Cate Blanchett was to play the role of Anna which I would love to have seen. I think she could have taken it somewhere Julia Roberts just isn't capable of. Ironically Cate Blanchett beat Natalie Portman for her performance in this film. Jude Law is phenomenal and repulsive all at once. There isn't a single character that we can feel bad for, which I think was a weak point, but that may have been the point. Natalir Portman hands down steals the show in what is her most grown up and involved role to date. All of the performances are great but what Natalie Portman brings to the character, the screen, and the film is AMAZING. Her losing at Oscar time was rather disappointing to me. I think this is a movie that deserves to be seen. Not everyone will like it, but there is brutal honesty. I would concur that the honesty is dramatized for the screen and hearing these people talk we may think ""people in relationships don't talk like that."" Though we may not, at least in Closer the characters will say what we think and want to say.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Tries too hard to be witty and sophisticated; ends up being neither.,"I disliked this film from the moment Natalie Portman and Jude Law appeared in slow motion while a desiccated, sniveling love song played on the soundtrack. Once they started talking to each other, it only got worse.So, how do I loathe CLOSER? Let me count the ways. The pacing is interminable, the characters are snotty and full of themselves, and the stilted dialogue sounds too rehearsed to be actual conversation. If I hadn't shut it off during the ""Internet sex chat"" scene, I undoubtedly would have found more reasons to punch these characters through a wall.I've sat through many ""art"" films, so it's not that I'm too inattentive or philistine to appreciate a leisurely paced movie with an intellect. But CLOSER has no intellect. Rather, it's like the Shelley Winters character in LOLITA: a know-nothing rube trying to be sophisticated but coming across as pathetic and contemptible to those who know better.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
Finally a mature script for a mature audience,"My first Mike Nichols experience and what a relief and pleasure to see a screenplay written for adults. Like the froth on a good latte, this was a joy to behold. But although the coffee may be good, it's not necessarily sweet  unless of course you add your own sugar.Centred around the intertwining of two couples, this is about love, deception, honesty, the nature of feelings and the illogical human trait of desiring that which is forbidden. While one half of each relationship knows exactly what they want, their other halves can't decide whether they want them or each other. It confirms that sometimes we just don't know what we want, but whatever happens is good for us somehow.Closer occasionally treads the fine line between relateability and the seemingly absurd, but how often this happens depends on your own life experience. However, despite the few instances I couldn't personally relate to, the film had me convinced of the integrity of the script to the extraordinary point of putting my faith in the writer that it was real  something I've never consciously done before. Generally, if I don't understand something I'll either accept it as fantasy or dismiss it as ludicrous. But the film managed to win my trust, despite myself.All performances were convincing and I'm thrilled the four main players took on roles we're not used to seeing them in; namely flawed but deeply human characters. It was great to see Clive Owen in a role that allowed him some decent expression.Closer is definitely an adult drama that not all will relate to, but for those who aren't afraid of a dose of reality, this is a rich and rewarding experience.",,Anonymous,Romance
Interesting Window to the Mind of the Other,"The previous comment with regard to this movie focused on the fact that this was a very cold film with little payoff. I very much agree and it is for those reasons that I will say I was very impressed.There are very few films in the world of cinema that actually depict the world of life in terms of potentiality, and this film very much chronicled the lives of four very miserable people who had no idea what they wanted. They were so wrapped up in their own convoluted minds that they virtually destroyed themselves. ""Know thyself"" and ""nothing in excess"" are perfect words to keep in mind while watching this movie, for this film reaches into some of the deepest areas of the human psyche and maps the territory of existential crisis.Sophocles dealt with themes of self destruction and utter blindness to others in his works in the Theban trilogy as did Shakespeare with ""Hamlet."" I am not going to say that this film comes even close to the work of the men I just mentioned, but this film does indeed provide a look into the side of life that most people do not want to acknowledge. Most people want to go to a movie where they will be thrust into the middle of a horrible situation, only to be taken to the light at the end of the tunnel. The cold hard truth of the matter is that many people in this world are not so lucky as to experience that light by simply going to a movie theater. Many people in this world are as cold and desolate as the characters in this film and I believe that is where the gold rests in this project. It is not one for the ages, but I am thankful that it was created if for no other reason to represent the side of life that most people choose to ignore. There was indeed a great deal of payoff in this film. Many people just don't want to believe that a story like this could mean something in the end. There is no light without darkness, and perhaps this film will serve the purpose of adjusting eyes accustomed to artificial light to take a walk in the darkness that exists in reality.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

You'll either love it or hate it.  Not much middle ground.,"I happened to love it. There's a very dark realness to the relationships in this film --- not necessary the characters themselves (writer, photographer, stripper, doctor), but the behavior of these people within their relationships. There's something very true to the glutton-for-punishment behavior that's portrayed that stays with you, probably because it IS so real. The acting was terrific, the dialogue sparse but completely on point, and the film moves at a nice pace, drawing you into each of the characters. Not the strongest of endings, (bit of a sellout if you ask me) but still a great flick. Not for everyone, though - some people applauded at the end of the movie, another group I overheard said they needed to go home and ""bathe to rid themselves of the filth of this movie"".",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Worth Watching,"A note to all thinking about watching this: All the negative reviews are failing to consider the perspective this film should be watched from. All of the dialog being said between the 4 main characters should be interpreted as what they are actually thinking but not saying. The actions and consequences play out on the screen as if we are saying all the ""normal"" things people say in these situations. Things that are often filled with mind games, false pleasantries, and deception with an end goal in mind, but not as raw or bluntly honest as the movie portrays. The title is Closer and alludes to what things look like between people when we are ""Closer"" to the honest thoughts and ambitions in their head.My only complaint Is ""Alices"" story line and what happens with her at the end isn't really built up or explained well outside outside a handful of sentences. This makes her ending seem a little lacking.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
"A boring, predictable throwback","Two couples, Jude Law and Natalie Portman and Clive Owen and Julia Roberts, play mixed-doubles in this supposedly honest and adult drama. After a long summer of teenage-fare at the movies, I, like many others, start to get a hunger for adult fare and themes. This should have been just what the doctor ordered. But it wasn't. Although I was impressed by both Natalie Portman and Clive Owen, I found myself groaning inwardly throughout this entire film. I didn't believe it for a second. For a film that was supposedly challenging and startling, I found it utterly predictable. I found myself saying the lines before the characters. (Granted, there was an occasional insightful turn of a phrase, but, overall, I was under whelmed by the script.) Now predictability isn't necessarily a bad thing. I knew how ""Downfall"" was going to end but I was at the edge of my seat anyway. My problem is that I didn't buy the characters and the way they talked to each other. All I saw was the artifice, and not the artifice the characters presented to shield themselves, but instead the artifice of the actors themselves and the writer. Despite some forceful performances, it struck me as phony. This film is little more than a throwback to the ""deep"" relationship films of the late-60s and early-70s. Had this film been released instead of ""Carnal Knowledge"" or ""Bob & Carol and Ted & Alice,"" even I'd probably be calling it a masterpiece. That's part of the problem. It seemed to speak to that society, not ours. The obvious comparison is with Kubrick's ""Eyes Wide Shut."" It covers some of the same emotional territory, and was also a product of past sensibilities, but I found that film challenging. Why? Mainly because the narrative took me places I didn't expect to go. The central themes about fidelity and trust were, frankly speaking, trite. However, that film's vivid characters and suddenly turn to mystery and the macabre kept me on my toes. I predicted every plot turn on this film and got bored waiting for the characters to catch up to me. I wish I could have shared the rapture many of the reviewers here felt when they saw this film, but it just didn't work for me.",,Anonymous,Romance
simplistic reality - loved it!,"Fantastic cast - great performances from all 4, but wonder how different it would have been had Cate Blanchette played Anna's role, as was originally intended (I think she has a wider range than Julia - don't get me wrong, I like Julia but I just wonder how different the film would feel had she been in it)... anyway, still, the movie was so intriguing because you wonder who ends up w/ whom and how love can make people do some crazy things. As shocking as the premise may be, it is hauntingly realistic (which is scary because I'm a romantic)- people do fall in and out of love so easily and are willing to fulfill their own desires and needs while hurting a loved one ... but isn't that what life is all about?: being happy?

Natalie Portman does a wonderfully convincing job as Alice, Clive Owens is powerful as Larry, but I thought that Julia Roberts and Jude Law could really do a lot better. There seemed to be an emptiness in their characters. Of course, you couldn't really connect to any of the characters, because it's a very true to life film, and you were only seeing bits and pieces of entire lives.

Far,"Somehow this film feels cold as one watches it unfold on the screen. Since this is not a story told in a linear manner, it confuses a lot of viewers, as the action switches back and forth. Mike Nichols is a director that has contributed a lot to the movies. He has an eye for what works and what doesn't. One suspects the problem with the film not being so accessible to everybody, lies in Patrick Marber's adaptation of his play. If you haven't seen the film, please stop reading here.When ""Closer"" played on Broadway, it had a stellar cast. Perhaps, the weakest link in the film is Anna. As played by Julia Roberts, this is a woman who is an enigma, at best. One is never sure where she stands at any given moment. Anna, is a successful photographer, but her life is a mess. She is divided between Dan, the obituary writer that wants to be a novelist, and Larry, the doctor who falls in love with her, but who has a streak of sadism within him. Anna is ultimately her own victim for staying in a marriage that will destroy her in the long run.Then there is Alice. When we first see her at the beginning of the film, she is walking in a crowded London street. Dan, the writer, is walking in the opposite direction, also surrounded by a lot of people. We know right away these two are going to meet, not realizing yet, they really don't know one another. Alice is hit by a taxi when she, obviously confused by the London traffic, has looked in the opposite direction in order to cross the street. Dan comes to help her. He ends up falling in love with her.At the end of the film we also watch Alice, this time in New York. She is walking among a crowd in Manhattan and men keep ogling at her. What happens next, no one can see in the film, but it seems that Alice is going to try to walk as though she is still living in London. A fatal mistake!Larry, the man in love with Anna, is also a troubled soul. He loves to chat with unknown persons in the internet. In fact, that's how he meets Anna, when he is misdirected to a date at the Acquarium. Larry is a sensual man whose desires are not satisfied by Anna. He must look for excitement wherever he can get it. That's why when he meets Alice, who is now on her own working as an exotic dancer in a stripper's club, Larry's wants to have sex with her, but the young woman proves to be a tease who will not go to bed with him. Larry confesses to Anna his indiscretions and how he had sex in New York on a business trip. Larry is the only one that achieves some sort of normalcy with Anna.Dan is also a man that having found happiness with Alice, courts disaster in going for Anna. He betrays Alice in such a shameful way that makes us questions us his motives. He is a man who doesn't know what he wants. He had happiness, but let it go from his fingers in pursuit of Anna, who at the end, rejects him. When Dan questions Alice about her life in the States, she tells him she is just a plain nobody named Jane Jones, but in Dan's mind, she is lying. The truth comes out as she passes the customs area on her return to New York.The film has a terrific star turn by Clive Owen. He is the one that comes out the best of all four actors because even though he plays the worst possible character, he makes a splash of it, in sharp contrast to the rest of the cast, with the only exception of Natalie Portman. Ms. Portman shows a vulnerable side to her Alice. Jude Law is not likable in his role and he is running the risk of overexposure in films. Julia Roberts is good in light comedy, but in a serious drama like this, shows a disadvantage that is notable.Mike Nichols has created the right atmosphere for the movie. His choice of music is excellent as well, but one wonders if this is one of the best films of the year, why does it feel shallow in the final analysis.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
"""Closer"":  Rate it ""I"" for ""Immature""","This film depicts self-centered, immature people who seem to spend no time with any friends or family... no time on their nominal jobs... but an inordinate amount of time screwing the other 3 characters--either literally or figuratively--and promoting Philip Morris products.I was completely unconvinced by the sexual choices Julia Roberts makes--when she talked about whom she was involved with and why, it just sounded like she was reading a script.I don't get why this picture is for ""mature audiences""--it depicts behavior one sees in adolescents who turn to using sex for power, drinking, and smoking because they are neglected at home.This movie is an egregious example of cigarette advertising. In fact, smoking seems to be more desirable than sex in this film--since tobacco usage is depicted almost constantly and actual sex is only talked about.A Philip Morris cigarette brand has been prominently placed... right along with the Sony laptops.Occasionally a character halfheartedly states that he or she has quit--but that is meaningless. The image left in one's mind is of the character smoking. Smoking is portrayed as deeply pleasurable, sexy, comforting, and oh-so-naughty.(If you doubt that this film encourages people to smoke, read some of the things viewers have posted on the message board.)Dr. ""Stubble,"" the dermatologist--would you trust him to treat your acne?--seems unconcerned that smoking causes people's skin to thin, wrinkle, and sag by the time they turn 35.

....Then Farther Apart,"I have been waiting for this film since I first started seeing previews at least 3 months ago. Reason 1: The stellar cast- Julia Roberts, Clive Owen, Natalie Portman, and the seemingly omnipresent Jude Law. Reason 2: Mike Nichols. I've been a fan since The Graduate. and 3. The haunting song teaser they played in the previews, and now on the televised previews. This raspy, thready, ""I can't take my eyyyeesssss off you....."" - It positively obsessed me to find out the name and singer, which alone has been my unrealized mission for 3 months. I am being sidetracked, but bear with me. It will all become evident why I talk of the song so much. Okay, so on Thursday our local newspaper reviewer, who gave it an ""A-"", by the way, mentioned the song as being sung by Damien Rice. This Irishman has SOUL. Now about the movie. The song made me doubly interested in the movie, though I already knew I wanted to see it. Truth be told, had they not played that song in the preview, I wouldn't have been at the first showing the day it opened.The movie doesn't disappoint, and does. This is NOT ""warm, fuzzy, holiday fare"". If you want that, stay home and watch Jimmy Stewart movies. What it IS is a finely tuned foray into relationships, specifically what we do to each other in relationships in quest for the ""perfect love"".Excellent performances all around. The luminous Natalie Portman has gone to the top of my list, even surpassing the engaging Julia Roberts, who, incidentally, is not the sweet innocent she usually plays. Jude Law is so good, and thankfully made me forget Alfie. Clive Owen has the most expressive eyes. He gave a wonderful performance. It may be a bit difficult to adjust initially to each scene. The passage of time in between quickly becomes evident, however, and you'll find yourself in rhythm. Clive Owen gave an interview on our local TV station yesterday and prepared me, however, for the ending. I was really glad he did, because, although he didn't give anything away, he forewarned that you won't leave feeling all warm and fuzzy. Great effort from all involved.

Summary: Dazzlingly Brilliant: Nichols Takes the Relationship Flick to a New Level of Raw Honesty,"Director Mike Nichols took playwright and scriptwriter Patrick Marber's dissection of romantic entanglements affecting and forever altering the lives of two couples to a deep dimension of compelling complexity. Taking as a theme the devastating role jealously and lies play in peoples' love lives, Nichols crafted a drama that asks many questions including one most lovers face at one point or another - how much does a man or woman really want to know about a partner? And...can the price of forcing disclosure bring unwanted and uncontrollable relationship immolation? This is a four-character film as befits its origin in the theater. Set in London, it starts with a happenstance that by itself might augur a fairly ordinary, predictable plot. Alice (Natalie Portman) arrives from New York without so much as a carry-on bag. Unaware of the direction in which traffic move, she steps off a curb and is knocked down by a cab, fortunately receiving only minor injuries.Rushing to her rescue is Dan (the so very-ubiquitous-on-screen-these-days Jude Law). Dan is an aspiring novelist whose first book will soon be out. To pay for tea and crumpets he pens obituaries for a newspaper. Off-handedly gallant, he takes the young woman, formerly a Big Apple stripper she later announces, to a very crowded casualty ward (as they call the E.R. in Old Blighty). Alice tells him she's left her previous boyfriend with just a few simple words, ""I don't love you anymore."" Her appearance reflects youth, her words suggest a lot of experience.For the jacket of his book and publicity Dan needs his picture taken and Anna (Julia Roberts) is the society shutterbug with whom he falls instantly and deeply in lust in her studio. Never mind that Alice, now his live-in lover, will soon arrive at the studio after washing up from her waitress job.Dan plays an asinine, juvenile prank on dermatologist Larry (Clive Owen, who played the same part on stage) to bring the doctor and the photographer together at an aquarium. It's the sort of stupid and also thoughtless ""joke"" now made easier and anonymous by the weapon of choice of many - the Internet. It's probably not even clear to Dan why he does this. A lot of things aren't clear to Dan.What follows is complex interaction between the four as affections and genitals exchange places. Not casual lover swapping but rather emotion-laden experimentation with unpredictable outcomes. Very sharp cinematography and quick closeups do much to heighten tension and insure momentum. Momentum to what? This very adult, very affecting drama coheres largely because of the splendid acting of the outstanding quartet. Julia Roberts gives the most psychologically deep portrayal of her career. With a contract always short-stopping any nude scenes, Ms. Roberts' Anna is rawly naked emotionally. Dismissed by one lover as a ""depressive,"" her divorced Anna is more uncertain about what she wants than she is clinically depressed. She's successful and yet her face mirrors the too common fear of attractive, successful women that at heart they are frauds on the verge of being unveiled as such.Engagingly quirky and fun as the photographer in ""Road to Perdition"" and more recently as the amoral, predatory Alfie in the re-make of the Michael Caine classic, Jude Law's Dan is a man who doesn't know when to stop asking the wrong questions, demanding answers he shouldn't seek. Sly and seductive at times, consumed by jealousy at other points, both too sure and very unsure, Law spins Dan to near chaotic life. Perhaps he's a cad, maybe he's simply in too deep with precious little introspection - Nichols and Law give Dan a flawed character who is viewed as a curiosity but without censure.Larry, as projected by Clive Owen, is capable of psychological cruelty, a mask for his own needs. His relationship with the other three characters resembles a well-driven car that at unexpected moments threatens to career off the road because of the driver's lapse of control.And that leaves the truly remarkable Natalie Portman who, intentionally or not, is the central character. Ms. Portman showed the depth of her acting range in a short scene in ""Cold Mountain"" which signaled she was ready for major roles in other than near sitcom flicks. Her breadth of emotions in ""Closer"" is powerful and gripping. From ingénue in London without apparently a change of clothes to a woman grappling with love won and possibly lost, she's alternately achingly vulnerable and surprisingly - almost brutally - steely. This is an Oscar worthy performance by a young actress who will be around, impressively so, for a long time.What makes Closer"" so much more than the average relationship story is the questions Nichols poses but declines to answer. Trust, jealousy, commitment, lust, expectations, betrayal - all are interwoven in the four characters' interaction. And the unifying mystery is the question of questions. How much should any lover ask his/her partner about past relationships and even present moral if not legal infidelities? Not since the powerful Indie flick, ""Chasing Amy,"" has that very real and often destructive but sometimes uncontrollable need to know about a lover's past been so transparently pursued.Reactions, including comments on this board, to ""Closer"" are highly polarized. There isn't much of a middle ground unlike for another recent superlative relationship movie, ""Sideways,"" where consensus seems to clump together at the high end. I suspect one reason why some viewers have hated this movie, including a few very vocal folks at the close of the screening in Manhattan today, is that Nichols makes a number of moviegoers genuinely uncomfortable seeing what so many of us, at one time or another, have endured in the quest for love. In a way, people who have never felt the heartbreak played out here, the unstoppable collision with the future, have missed something important albeit terribly hard.Absolutely Mick Nichols's finest film but he couldn't have done it with a less gifted cast.Fine cinematography and the score, ranging from pop to Mozart and Rossini, subtly but effectively supports the story line.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Brilliant,"I heard about this movie a few weeks before it came out. When I saw the commercial I saw no action, and no obvious villain, just couples talking a lot. So I expected nothing. I had no idea the movie would be this good. I am so accustomed to being able to tell what will happen in the next scene of a movie before the scene happens, so I find most movies boring. In this movie I could not predict what would happen and was on the edge of my seat.At first you feel that Jude Law is just the ultimate pimp, every woman wants him and he hardly tries. You also feel sorry for Clive Owen because it seems that he is brilliant and good looking but his life is just going down the toilet. That is where the movie gets you. Later you discover that Clive Owen is a genius when it comes to understanding the human thought process and by the end of the movie he has basically stripped away all respect we hold for Jude Law and Owens shows us what he has known all along. He does this with all the main characters in the movie. We see what he has known all along, that Jude Law is a baby,that Julia Roberts enjoys destroying herself, and that Natalie Portman is a strong girl who is not mature enough yet to know how to deal with adult situations.I think it is funny that people are saying that this movie is not happy and that it will not make you feel good about relationships, and that none of the characters are likable. I think what bothers people is that the movie does not sugar coat anything, what you see is what you get.And in this movie, Clive Owen is a freakin God. His acting is incredible, the scene with him and Portman in the strip club was insanely good, and the way he plays with Jude Laws emotions is so genius and devious that you must admire him for it. Some of the stuff that comes out of Clive Owens mouth is so unexpected and shocking that you might as well assume his character has turrets syndrome.the movie is very good. and if you do not like it because it is not a happy film, then go watch the incredibles or some other Disney movie.This is a very good movie. 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
One of the all-time Best Screenplays!,"I was surprised to see this incredible movie snubbed at the Oscars for a couple of awards, bit I digress.Not often is it that the public gets a chance to see a movie with such relevance, such beauty and insight, such genius dialogue masterfully portrayed by some amazing actors.The story focuses on 4 individuals in London who are in love with the idea of love. Though their individual dependence on one another brings them closer, their insecurity breaks them apart. Anna (Julia Roberts), Alice (Natalie Portman), Dan (Jude Law), and Larry (Clive Owen) each lust for strangers, thus having jobs that usually brings strangers 'closer.' To borrow a tag-line from the movie, ""If you believe in love... Take a closer look,"" this film sucks you into a non-existing world that so closely both reflects and fictionalizes our society. Though some may say it lacks any realism, anyone who's lived in a large city on their own knows that the film pays homage and respect to their experience.Brilliantly captured by one of the best directors of all time, Mike Nichols, it presents true messages and themes of passion, anger, jealousy, and of course love.If you have never seen this movie I suggest you pick up a copy immediately. And hey, if you've seen it once already, see it again, I guarantee you'll pick up stuff you couldn't the first time you viewed it. The complex screenplay is worth examining thoroughly.Definitely one of the best movies of all time. Ten stars!",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Worst Movie EVER,"Unfortunately, I was wooed by the inaccurately positive reviews, all star cast and award nominations. I felt as those the script was written by a schizophrenic child in the throws of an episode. The movie has no plot, no theme, no substance, disjointed dialog, insane and unbelievable characters and dialog. I can NOT believe people, actors, directors, etc., actually participated in this movie. I am a very educated and open minded, worldly person and I STILL found absolutely NO redeeming qualities about this movie. I thought the Constant Gardener was bad; ""Closer"" is absolutely the worst!!!!! Even if I was completely drunk, I could not enjoy this movie. PLEASE AVOID!!! FOR YOUR SAKE!!!!",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
impressive,"When i first went to the cinema with my cousin on 15th January we had planned to see million dollar baby. When the found we would have to wait four damn hours we decided to see closer. Closer is, in my opinion a great film. The humour is not stupid, does not rely on fart jokes, but instead is adult comedy at it's very best. I can tell you in two words why it is so good: Julia Roberts! Particularly in one scene where she and Clive Owen are arguing over her having sex with Jude Law(his character)in there apartment. The vivid descriptions of what she did are shocking and it takes a lot of stomach to say things such as ""he f****d me and I came twice"". Another element of the film which deserves credit is the beautiful sound track especially from Damien Rice which is depressing, but beautifully effective. In fact I was surprised that the UK censors only rated it a fifteen, rather than eighteen because this film is beautiful is heartbreaking, beautiful and extremely rude. One of the best contemporary dramas is recent years along with lost in translation and one of my personal favourites, Donnie Darko. Oh yeah and the it's good to see Julia Roberts back in the UK after noting hill.",,Anonymous,Romance
Lar and Anna and Dan and Alice,"Mike Nichols is one of my favorite directors, a multi-talented genius who has never been afraid to work on the edge (quite possibly he cannot work any other way), and when he delves into the intense Scorpionic waters of the savagery involved in the vast majority of one-on-one relationships, you know a profound experience is in store.With Closer, he returns to the Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf format of 4 people brutally ravaging one another's psyches. Closer is different though, of course, because it takes place over a period of time rather than a consecutive amount of days, as Woolf did, and it's a much better film, I believe: over the years, Nichols has managed to hone his innate Scorpio talent of restraint, and Closer benefits from this magnificently. Like Virginia Woolf, it's based on a play, and it does feel stagy, but this works FOR the film - the framework of one scenario after the other in which time has passed (or regressed, as the case may be; the film is not entirely linear, which is another brilliant choice) creates the discipline - the illusion of civility - necessary to exhibit the brutal mind games and lethal, obsessive ego-driven powerplays that endlessly occur between the 4 characters.I realized over dinner after seeing it last night (my last film of 2004!) that Closer is basically an s&m film, without one whip or chain ever appearing, and it's an unbelievably violent film, without one head rolling across the screen and without the male characters resorting to duking it out in the streets a la Bridget Jones. I also appreciated how ONLY the 4 characters have speaking parts in the movie, and how all 4 are very articulate and somewhat self-aware: they sort of know why they're doing what they're doing, they do understand themselves on some level, but they're still helpless to stop their behavior because their egos are involved, particularly with the 2 men.What they don't understand - or want to understand - is the meaning of 'truth', which is essentially a 5th character in the movie: 'truth' is used as a blunt instrument by all 4 of the characters, and ironically, when one of them actually TELLS the truth in a non-hurtful way (it's Alice, who admits to Larry at one point that her real name is Jane) she is of course not believed. At the heart of this is the sad truth that most of the time, whenever anyone tries to get closer to anybody else, whether the attempt is sincere or otherwise, he or she eventually comes to understand that most people cannot deal with the truth, do not want to hear it and certainly not from someone they're intimately involved with, even if that person is sincere and not using 'truth' as a weapon, and so all relationships wind up being untruthful in one way or another.Law's Daniel commits what I think is the most mean-spirited act in the film, by chatting with Owen's Larry in an internet sex room (in one of the edgiest scenes in the film or rather it's tied with the scene in the strip club between Larry and Natalie Portman's Alice aka Jane - too provocative to even begin to describe, where the power shifts back and forth like in an especially well-matched chess game). In the chat room scene, Dan poses as Anna (Julia Roberts, who has never looked more human or been presented more effectively as seen through fellow-Scorpio Nichols' probing lens), but then he takes the chat one step further by telling Larry to meet 'her' at the aquarium, where he knows Anna goes all the time. Larry goes and Anna's there and Larry makes a major fool of himself, and he doesn't forget it - he gets his revenge indirectly through Anna and then directly, in the film's most brutal verbal confrontation between him and Daniel, later on.It also wasn't lost on this viewer how ironic the characters' professions in the film are: Anna is a photographer - she takes pictures of strangers, hoping to show their humanity but in reality she's using them because she doesn't really seem to be learning anything from her work. Alice is a stripper, which she digs because of the obvious power trip involved. Dan is a writer of obituaries by day and a fiction writer the rest of the time - he admits early on to Alice that his obits are all resplendent with euphemisms (i.e.: ""'he enjoyed his privacy' means he was a raving queen"", like that), and his fiction is apparently sex-driven accounts of his relationships; he's in essence using his partners as fodder for said fiction. Larry is a doctor, specifically a dermatologist: skin - superficial layers that get deeper as they are revealed. He has one of the best lines in the piece, which occurs during the final confrontation between the men, where Dan is whining about 'the heart' and Larry shoots back, ""have you ever seen a human heart? It looks like a fist covered in blood"", words to that effect - not the most subtle imagery, but in context it speaks volumes.My IMDb rating: 10 (****)",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Something Is Just Right About this One,"I'm not sure why I loved this movie; it's not really my type. However, for some reason it just rubbed me the right way. After you get past the whole, ""It's brutally honest"" B.S. what one is left with are beautiful performances and a pleasing end result. The subject material is slightly elevated in theme (sex and adultery), but, for the most part, adults will be able to relate in some way to one or more of the character. Speaking of which We have Jude Law in what may accurately be labeled his best performance to date; he is both touching and detestable at the same time creating an enigma for the viewer - do I love him or hate him? Regardless of the decision, one must admit that his ability to create such mixed feelings only shows his strong-hold as an actor.Julia, Julia, Julia, who, in their right mind, can say no to Julia Roberts dirty talking? Well, the truth is that she is the weakest character in the film, and that's saying a lot. HOWEVER, that is not to say that her acting is low-grade by any means. On the contrary, it is just that everyone else is so great and have much more interesting characters, not to mention that she actually has very less face-time in comparison. But when all is said and done, Roberts is as strong as ever, and she definitely gives her most vulnerable performance to date.WARNING: Oscar alert! Mr. Clive Owen is so incredibly awesome in this movie! I have not really seen any more of his material, but I can already say that I am a fan. His acting is flawless, breathtaking, and so real that one cannot help but take notice. I hope to see much more from him in the future.WARNING: Oscar alert! Ms. Natalie Portman in the best performance of her career, and one of the best of the year! I have loved Portman since I saw her in ""Where the Heart Is,"" but this can truly be termed as a ""powerful"" performance. She is simply breathtaking: beautiful, vulnerable, real, and so much more! The best character hands down.How can one say no to this film? Beautiful women giving superb performances and sexy men giving excellent performances in a tour de force film that will sweep you off your feet. See it now.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Riveting story,"I was glued to it and never lost interest at any point during the film. I enjoyed the intricacies and I thought the casting was brilliant. I like Cate Blanchett, who was originally offered the role of Jane/Alice, but I'm glad it went to Natalie instead. It does get a bit complicated throughout and you'll still be thinking about on your way home as you try to sort out who slept with whom and who lied to whom. Julia Roberts is as beautiful and I'd be dishonest if I didn't say that Jude Law is a good-looking fellow. I think the perverts of the world may be somewhat disappointed as they scour the internet trying to find the nudity that was so much hyped before the movie came out. I think they're expecting more that was actually shown (and more than the story required). I thought it was tastefully done and really is a watershed moment in Natalie's career. I hope to see her in more adult roles as she pulled this off very well for being the junior member of the cast.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Closer to perfection than any romantic-drama has ever come ...,"Let me begin by saying that ""Closer"" is the kind of film that you've gotta see for yourself to decide if you like it. Half the time I see reviews by people who loved the film, and half the time I see reviews by people who absolutely despised it. I, myself, loved it.""Closer"" is the story of four individuals: obituary writer and struggling author Dan (Jude Law), waitress and ex-stripper Alice (Natalie Portman), popular photographer Anna (Julia Roberts) and dermatologist Larry (Clive Owen). Dan and Alice meet in London after Alice is hit by a car. A few months later, Dan is being photographed for his novel by Anna, and the two fall in love - but only Dan will admit it. Trying to get back at Anna, he pretends to be her on an Internet sex chat and tells Larry to meet her at an aquarium for sex. By chance, the real Anna is at the aquarium; she meets Larry and the two fall in love.Eventually, Alice leaves Dan and Anna leaves Larry. By the end of the film, each man has had sex with each woman and vice versa; they seem to love whomever they're with, but in reality they only love their original partner.I'd heard good things about this film before watching it, but after watching it the first time I was disappointed. While it was no doubt a fine film, there was more sexual dialog than I could have ever imagined! Now I can tolerate sexuality in a movie just as much as the next guy, but when the film becomes unrealistically sexual than I become fed up with it. And ""Closer"" seemed to be just that. But now, having watched the movie numerous more times, I realize that the film is abnormally sexual, but not necessarily overly sexual. Would it have been better without so much sexuality? Yes. But the rest of the film makes up for it. Oh yes, does it ever.Patrick Marber's script is adapted from Marber's popular, award-winning play. The script is witty, intelligent and original. There are some great lines, which come from characters who seem very real.The acting is one of the film's high points. Jude Law is terrific as Dan, who tries to be mean but just can't pull it off. He makes the character a target for sympathy from the audience. Natalie Portman is, as always, very good, as Alice. Julia Roberts, while good, doesn't give the best performance of her career; it feels like she's not putting in a huge amount of effort. Clive Owen is outstanding as always; Owen's performance has made Larry my favorite character in the film. He really brings out the bad side of Larry, but he's likable at the same time. There's a certain air of mysticism around Larry, like you never know what he's going to do next. Interestingly, Owen played Law's part in the original stage play.Mike Nichols proves that his directorial talent hasn't faded one bit since he made the 1967 classic ""The Graduate"" - in fact, Nichols seems better than ever. He gives the film a cold, hard feeling, but at times he seems to loosen up - much like the characters themselves. He really captures the darkness of Patrick Marber's script.The few songs on the soundtrack are excellent, but the one that really stands out is ""The Blower's Daughter"" by Damien Rice. It's used for the film's theme, and there isn't another song in the world that is so perfect for this movie as ""Blower's Daughter"". The song is absolutely beautiful; the sad, determined strength found in the lyrics matches the film well.""Closer"" is closer to perfection than any romantic-drama has ever come. If you're looking for a soft romance like ""Sleepless in Seattle"" or ""Notting Hill"", then this is probably not the movie for you. This is a mature, dark, grim look at romance, and I love it. ""Closer"" has become one of my favorite films. If you feel like watching the film and deciding for yourself how you feel, and you keep an open mind, then I applaud you.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

The lines were expressed exactly as they would if it were being performed as a play. This would be fine were it on the stage, but it wasn't and any sense of natural dialogue was lost.Furthermore, there wasn't enough preparation to distinguish flashbacks from present-time.The occasional white fades were awful and every Mike Nichols 'touch' (tight zooms, quick jump shots) were lost in this film.Natalie Portman was the only redeeming character, but she didn't really redeem at all.

Surprising quality,"While Julia Roberts is not known for choosing deep, dramatic projects, she gave an impressive performance here. Natalie Portman is not my favorite, either, but I adored her in this. Her charm read better in this film than in previous work. Jude Law and Clive Owen are personal favorites who did not disappoint. This was the most realistic, adult movie I've seen in some time. Some will be turned off by the talky, stage quality of the film, but as an actor I was engrossed by the intellectual nudity that was present in place of graphic sex scenes (with a couple scenes excepted). It's nice to finally hear some intelligent, realistic dialog with a plot to match. While terribly depressing, it reflects some of the more difficult, unexplored questions about love and doesn't attempt to give definite answers to them.

Not even close,"I have just got around to seeing this on DVD, and wished I hadn't bothered. How can such a talented director and cast get it so wrong - apart from choosing an abysmal script, of course? And how can such a dud movie garner so many awards and nominations? Pointless and virtually plot less, this involves four unpleasant and unsympathetic characters spouting unconvincing, crude and - on occasions - unintentionally hilarious dialogue, so bad you wonder whether the writer didn't have some scenes left over from his days working with the deeply unfunny Steve Coogan. Jude Law seems to be playing two different characters. For the first ten minutes he is reasonably OK as a slightly diffident hack journalist, but then changes without rhyme or reason into... well, Jude Law. Clive Owen must be a better actor than he shows here, as a crude doctor with the worst bedside manner you could imagine. And Julia Roberts plays her part as if it was a first-rehearsal read-through for her role in Notting Hill, minus the charm. Only Natalie Portman emerges with anything resembling credit, but again, her character fails to genuinely convince. And a note to the casting director: aren't strippers supposed to have tits?

Not so close,"This movie is chock full of the least likable characters in recent memory. Julia Roberts and Jude Law have less than 0 chemistry.

He is gorgeous and alive, carrying every other pitiful performance of this film. He did the rest of the cast a great service.The dialogue was good, and I would definitely see the play, it just wasn't carried off by NP, JR and JL who all pranced around like mediocre hacks. I have really liked Jude Law in the past so this was quite a disappointment.This movie did instigate a good conversation afterward, but not particularly about the subject matter.

Make way for the superstar of the decade!,"Whether he turns out to be the new Bond or not, or whether or not Morgan Freeman steals his Oscar this month, one thing remains utterly sure: Clive Owen's performance in this film is one of the best, most brutal, most honest, most fearless and most captivating male performances in recent Hollywood history. This man DESERVES the Oscar, although going up against Morgan Freeman isn't going to be easy, since Freeman never won an Oscar before, and they want to give him one while they can (although his performance in the brilliant Million Dollar Baby isn't his best and most showy work to date).Clive Owen is the superstar of this film, and every longing woman that goes to see this to get yet another glimpse of their dream man (Jude Law), will forget all about him instantly and fall under the Owen spell. He received a Golden Globe for this role, and if justice truly exists he will get an Oscar as well the 27th. Natalie Portman comes off twice as good as Julia Roberts in an amazing performance as well, showing that she might be one of the biggest actresses yet (as she began to reveal in Cold Mountain). So forget about her wooden Star Wars escapades, alongside Owen she makes one of the decade's most powerful star-making performances. But still, Owen is the real star here.

So many people are f**cked up when it comes to romantic relationships. and movies and pop music often tell entirely fabricated truths about romance and love.This movie (and the play ultimately) tells true stories about people who are dysfunctional, who need therapy, who are human.Jude Law's character is addicted to falling in love, addicted to the unattainable woman. He wants to win. He wants to feel manly enough to get the girl and once he's got her he begins to freak out. Sound familiar? These people exist and it's great to see dysfunction on the screen!

Just think of the political scene, both in America and Britain...The parallels of the movie's theme and the lies and betrayals in each of our countries is astonishing.Art is always meant to be seen on more than one level...as is life itself...but too often we settle for what seems obvious and literal.

Surprisingly little good to be said about the horrible film from highly acclaimed director Mike Nichols (""The Graduate"" HBO's ""Angels in America"", ""Working Girl"").

This is not your normal Julia Roberts movie, which should be a good thing, but isn't.

Alice seems to be the only likable character until the revelation about her which proves she was no better than the others.Clive Owens character is disgusting and admirable at the same time.

"Julia and Jude star, but Natalie and Clive sparkle","Although Julia Roberts and Jude Law would be considered the leading actress and actor of this film, Clive Owen and Natalie Portman are the ones who really stand out. In the film, Portman plays a young stripper/waitress, Alice, who falls in love and moves in with Law's Dan, who repeatedly cheats on her with Robert's Anna, who keeps seeing him even when she marries Owen's Larry. Alice is both innocent and nasty, being the first one hurt by Anna and Dan's affair and the second to seek revenge. She comes off as the wisest and least nasty of the four, but that doesn't mean she's clean. On the contrary, Larry is very nasty. His obsession with and devotion to Anna is very genuine, and when he finds out about the affair, he interrogates her in a way so crude and tough it would put any police interrogator to shame. He comes off as the cleverest, the one who knows how to pit one lover against the other and come out on top. Although Anna and Dan are the two that begin the battle of affections, Alice and Larry are the ones who play the game and end the war.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Best movie I have seen in a long time. Unbelievable!,"I do apologise for going overboard but this movie leaves me with no choice but to proclaim my astonishment and awe at the lucidity of the plot, dialogues, and the story as a whole.I hope this movie grosses a lot of moolah at the box office so that meagre men like myself can get to see movies like this one more often. But I dread to think what that movie would be like that can shake me more than this one.Many things happen to me when I watch a movie. I often identify with one or more of the characters at some level or the other. In this movie I was identifying myself with ALL the characters. My life was tumbling in front of me. I went flushed, hot and sweaty at certain points of time. I had to remove my sweater within 13 minutes into the movie.I would be embarrassed to go to this movie with any relatives of mine. I did not see this movie with my wife. I am very confused about it. I guess it may be better if she sees this movie alone in her own accord. I am certainly not showing it to her. However would love to talk about it to her. In detail.Lucid. Raw. Disarming. Brutal. Real.Jude Law, Julia Roberts, Clive Owens and Natalie Portman. Thank you all so much. And I really mean it.I must add a note reagarding some comments posted here by those who did not connect with what this movie was about. Reading those comments dint help me ""understand"" anything. I realise now that there are many like that. All I can say is that this is a movie that is somewhat like an Oil Painting where thigs are painted on a canvas not to represent a photographic reproduction of a scenery but a rather rich illustration of the characteristics of what is being pained. Please read the comment written by user ""aimless"" below. As it is the most apt comment I have read for this movie. I am quite certain that this movie wont connect with people who are not into relationships or have not participated in the Darwinian dating/relationship game. Also many have mentioned about Julia Roberts being understated in this movie. BUT THAT IS HER ROLE!!! She playes the character of a clinically depressed person. who cant look straight into anyones eyes for long. She wants to escape as is the philosophical position taken by many married women. Clive actually words it. Clive is actually a victim of his own loyalty and desire to procreate!! Other characters are victims of a quest to find various truths. Julia is more controlling with the ""position"" of a vulnerable defensive person pretending to be trapped. The role of Julia Roberts is very subtle. And very powerful.If you are a bloke, blokey bloke or a woman or a young girl... this movie is thoroughly engrossing. This movie will be mentioned in film schools in the future! Definitely classic.Watch this movie folks. (if you are over 20) You could not have spent your money on a more rewarding recent movie. regards, Dee.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Worst Movie of the Year.,"After hearing some good reviews of this film, my wife and I picked it up at the video store. What we found is probably one of the worst films I've ever seen.First off, the film drags on. This is a trap that many filmmakers fall into when they make a picture that relies on discourse.In addition, the dialogue in the film was very raunchy. Some of the lines seam to have been lifted out of Penthouse. I'm sure that the ""this is Art, not Profanity"" battle cry will be sounded. But please.All of the characters were so appalling, that I found my self hoping that some sort of disaster killed them all. In addition they were all flat. None of the character evolve. None of them learn from there mistakes. They just keep on making them.Portman is horrible. She was like watching a high school drama club production of Our Town. I think that Julia Roberts probably owed some one a favor.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
raw,"This was one of the most emotionally raw films I have seen in a long time. And, I thought, one of the truest. For anyone who has ever been involved in an infidelity, it was quite true to form. It was very well written and directed. The actors, for the most part, did an excellent job. The least impressive was Julia Roberts (who spent the majority of the movie looking like she was trying to hide her body) though she didn't necessarily do a bad job. Natalie Portman was definitely the star of this film however. Her performance was really enjoyable to watch and she has shown herself to be an incredibly capable actress. While I enjoyed the movie, it's not going to be for everyone. Some would never be unable to get beyond the graphic nature of the dialog. For a movie where you never actually saw anyone having sex, it was a very sexually graphic film - if you see it, you'll understand what I mean. All in all, I recommend it if you enjoy well acted and intelligent films, but I wouldn't send my Mom.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

Simply Amazing.,"This movie tries something different.. nowadays more and more filmmakers are going for those ""out of the ordinary"" scripts, this movie is somewhat one of them. The true beauty that lies in this film is the fact that it is real, it focuses on how we fall in and out of love with others, and then you really can't be sure of how close you are to someone, or how well you think you know them. Starting Off With The Acting.. Clive Owen and Natalie Portman are the stars of the show.Clive delivers at truly remarkable performance especially after coming off of King Arthur. He is strong, believable, and has an undeniable presence when his face is on the screen.Natalie has finally shown what she is capable of in this movie, and just goes to show how truly talented she is. After being amazing in Garden State, she has grown a lot. She is amazing as Alice, the youngest, but strongest of the 4 leads. As the most complex characters, she delivers in the best way, possible.Julia definitely has stepped it up. Now she's been stereotyped in some of her earlier movies, but this is her most real role to date. Julia truly makes the character of Anna unlikable, and even though she's Julia Roberts you still can't help but dislike this character. Good, but outshone by Natalie.Jude Law has been quite a few good movies, and he is pretty good as Dan. His acting is fairly good, but again, he is outshone by Clive Owen. I'm not saying his performance is bad however, it was very good, and you can't ask for much more when your cast as a character like Dan.The movie itself is near flawless... however it may be a little jumpy. Each character has a line that just gets you, and those lines are delivered with such force. Bravo Mike Nichols! The dialogue is extremely intricate.. however the overall plot could have been tweaked. In all honesty, I thought this movie would be incredible... leagues ahead of ESOTSM, because it did have the potential. But my actual feeling about it had to be toned down, while it's not the amazing legend I thought it might be, It is still easily one of the best movies of this year and all timeThis movie will have it's haters but... don't forget you're not supposed to like these characters, and this movie is very sexual. But it's not claiming that it isn't very sexual, so don't criticize it for what it's trying to do.On par with Eternal Sunshine and Before Sunset, and Finding Neverland.*~10/10~*",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Great script, great cast, great arse","Closer is witty, clever and compelling and there is great chemistry between Law, Roberts, Portman and Owen who leave their star status behind and really embody the characters. The themes of trust, honesty and jealousy are familiar but conveyed brilliantly and innovative by Nichols. It also contains some rather revealing scenes of Natalie Portman as a stripper for all the red-blooded males out there.It is clear from the start that the material is adapted from a play - the above four are essentially the only characters in the whole film, it is entirely dialogue-based and there are temporal ellipses throughout. Whereas in the theatre the characters would leave the stage and the curtain would go down to mark each year or so gap, the cinema audience has to figure out the breaks for itself and it can occasionally be quite confusing.But Closer is a treat - a Best Of compilation of relationships without the forgettable sugary bits in between.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Not really beautiful, but boy, can she act!","Nichols' casting is 3/4 correct in ""Closer"". Law, Owen, and Portman seemed hand-picked. Julia Roberts seems placed in the cast so the whole production won't lost money.

Larry and Anna and Dan and Alice,"""Closer"", based on a play by the British dramatist Patrick Marber, is a romantic drama tracing the complex ins-and-outs of the relationships between four people, two men and two women. The four are Dan, a journalist working on the obituary column of a national newspaper, Larry, a doctor, Anna, a professional photographer and Alice, a stripper. (It turns out that Alice's real name is Jane, but I will refer to her by the name by which she is known throughout most of the film). Dan and Larry are British, Anna and Alice American; I understand that in the original play all four characters were British, but the film-makers obviously wanted to include some big-name Hollywood stars.The film starts when Alice is hit by a taxi while crossing the street and Dan, who just happens to be on the scene, takes her to the hospital for treatment. This is the start of a romance between them. There is not room to set out all the complexities of the plot, but the film deals with the intricate sequence of events which begins when Dan meets and becomes obsessed with Anna, a sequence which involves a romance, and eventually a marriage, between Anna and Larry and an affair between Anna and Dan.The film has been described as a modern version of Mozart's opera ""Così Fan Tutte"", but as it is a long time since I last saw that work I will not deal with that aspect. (Music from the opera is heard on the soundtrack). It is a difficult film to categorise, because it contains elements of both comedy and tragedy. The initial meeting between Alice and Dan could be regarded as a classic rom-com ""meet-cute""- her injuries are not serious- and there is a very funny scene where Dan plays a prank on Larry by pretending to be Anna on an internet cybersex chat site. The film, however, is far from wholly comic; it deals with real emotions and real unhappiness; there is not a happy ending for all the characters. Those allergic to strong language and sexual references will not like the film, but my view was that this language reflects modern usage among many people and that any attempt to bowdlerise it would have weakened the film's impact.The acting is generally of a high standard. Clive Owen has not always been my favourite actor, especially after I saw his dull and uncharismatic performances in ""King Arthur"", also from 2004, and the dreadful ""Derailed"" from the following year, but he is much better here as Larry. Probably the best of the cast was Natalie Portman who brought a sense of the poignant and tragic to her portrayal of Alice. Contrary to one reviewer, I wouldn't agree that the film is about ""four severely unlikable characters""; ""flawed but recognisably human"" would be my assessment of all four, even Jude Law's Dan, the nearest thing the story has to a villain.The film was produced by an American company, Columbia, and made by an American director, Mike Nichols. It was to be his penultimate film; his last was to be ""Charlie Wilson's War"", which also stars Julia Roberts, who appears here as Anna. Roberts and Owen were to appear together again in ""Duplicity"" from 2009. Despite bringing in two international film stars to play the female leads, Columbia and Nichols deserve credit for keeping the London setting; some Hollywood film-makers would doubtless have switched the action to New York or some other American city. They also deserve credit for making a film which takes an intelligent, literate and thoughtful look at human relationships. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Men:  Want to own her orgasms?  Get help, cinema won't help you!","What is learned about people through this film? I learned by clicking on the writer that is was based on an award-winning play, and upon learning this my bewilderment was compounded. This film was not one constructed for entertainment. It does not depict young people as being kind or particularly sensitive, nor does it depict them as being particularly bright or courageous or capable of contiguous, if not rational, thought processes. It does not depict men as being interested in much beyond seeing or penetrating a woman's vagina (or being responsible for or counting her orgasms). It does not present three dimensional characters (nor developed character arcs for your screenwriters out there) whose motives, desires and frailties are explored, examined, or deconstructed with any depth whatsoever. So I am left with nothing but an empty, hollow feeling because once again my generation specifically, and humanity generally, is being compressed into a tiny, incoherent, two dimensional space. And if, for some bizarre reason beyond comprehension, this film was made for entertainment purposes, I'd have to say that Mike Nichols has failed, miserably.

CLOSER to reality,"This film goes into so much depth within the story and the actors playing there parts its unbelievable.

Addictive,"Closer is a movie chamaeleonic in time. The movie changes from viewing to viewing.And that's all. Love it eventually. Love everything eventually.The emotional starkness of the film is ravaging in two different ways. When the scenes are being played poorly it is enough to make one literally and audibly wince. When the scenes are being played well the movie is sad enough to bring tears.The performances are easy to examine because the cast is only four strong. Jude Law is middling. When he is with Clive Owen he is good; the rest of the time he is poor. Natalie Portman is shocking in her compromised delivery of dialogue. It is almost as though she is entirely without emotional empathy at a biological level. Julia Roberts plays a photographer. Whenever she holds a camera it looks like the first time she has ever done so in her life. Her scenes with Natalie Portman are bleak. Clive Owen is awe-inspiring. Whether he is facing off against the absent Portman, struggling Roberts or competent Law, he always seems to be his character and totally immersed in the moment at hand.There is lots of humour in this film. Some of it comes from the movie being good (mostly scenes with Clive Owen). Most of the humour comes from the agog awfulness with which the other actors handle their roles.Anyone living anything less than a contented life full of love, preferably also an exciting and cosmopolitan life, will find this movie challenging and uncomfortable and unsettling and polarizing. It will leave you numb from how bad it can be and numb from how good it can be. It will make you laugh in mocking and laugh from being caught up in the moment with the characters. It is melancholy both in its nihilistic view of human existence and in the realist way it was compromised in casting to be brought to the screen. This movie is a sublime contradiction. It is undeniable. Every time one watches this movie there is more to love. It is so bubbling with confusing hot electric energy that one's emotions and thoughts are enlivened like bare skin in a chilly breeze. This movie can get inside your bloodstream. Like all addictive things, it is poisonous and at first your mind will try to reject it. If you can forget this initial unpleasantness, it will be a movie to love.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Has a lot to say if you're willing to listen,"I am not going to write a long or detailed review, but I thought this film was so consistently brilliant in writing and performance and so unflinching in it's honesty I was not only impressed but will probably go to see it again within a week. The words ""I love you."" get thrown around in such a frivolous and sometimes desperate manner that you get frustrated at how meaningless they are. In films somebody saying that should mean something; that's what we're used to. But they really are meaningless in the face of the character's actions (except for Larry, who even though he might be a ""**ing caveman"" still did absolutely whatever worked to get his wife back and I believed truly forgave her- and actually, he even says it meaninglessly to Alice). It would be easy to judge these characters and hate them and the movie, but the truth is to the people on the insides of these involvements it always seems they're doing the best they can and really are being honest. Step out of the observers point of view, or think of somebody you've known who's like Anna, or Dan.I also can't believe this film had me cheering (inwardly) for the unscrupulous fight Larry put up to win Anna back. Clive Owen owned this film. -Nita",,Anonymous,Romance
Closer: 8/10,"From September to the end of the year, Jude Law will have been in six movies-I ? Huckabees, Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow, Alfie, A Series of Unfortunate Events, The Aviator, and Closer. I'm sure most people are sick of him, but I think he's a good actor, and I like seeing him take on different types of roles. Certainly, Closer is a different type of role, and Law gets to use his natural British tongue here. Law also has some great support here: Natalie Portman (coming off of her role in Garden State), Clive Owen (now becoming more mainstream thanks to...King Arthur?), and Julia Roberts (who'd think she'd be GOOD in something?). And when you're being directed by Mike Nichols, how bad can you really be?Alice (Portman) is hit by a car and is taken to the hospital by Dan (Law). They fall in love. Dan has his picture taken by Anna (Roberts) and falls in love with her. He plays a trick on Larry (Owen) by pretending to be Anna online. Anna and Larry meet. They fall in love. Things continually get switched around like that.Closer is based on a play by Patrick Marber. There can't be more than 10 scenes, most of the story is relied on by dialogue, and there's a scarce number of characters. Now, I'm not sure if it's that fact or not, but it seemed like Mike Nichols did an outstanding job directing. This could just be me and my quirky film tastes, but I loved how there was absolutely no sense of time. You saw two people together for ten minutes, then a new scene, where something obviously must have happened, but what? That's where the dialogue comes in. That's how we find out what has happened in the time lapses. It's Nichols not condescending to the audience. He's trusting us enough to put together the pieces for the movie. In a way, this movie reminded me a lot of Godard's Contempt, in that scenes lasted for a long time. In Contempt about 45 minutes of the middle of the movie is one scene in a house, with two people talking. Closer obviously was influenced by that movie, and that's a good thing.All four of the lead actors (in fact, basically the only four actors) are amazing-more than I thought possible for any of them. Roberts (known in the film community as ""that person who stole Ellen Burstyn's Oscar in 2000"") does a surprisingly good job-she seems to not have any ego here (now THAT is surprising), and that allows her to put in a realistic performance as one of those pretentious art-gallery types. Owen, who had been Dan in the original stage production, seemed to know what do to the most, and for that, was probably the best out of the four, closely rivaled by Portman. Shedding her goody-goody roles of the past, she plays a stripper who becomes entangled with everyone else. Garden State proved her acting talents, and Closer confirmed them. Law also proved that his six-films-a-year style doesn't faze him at all-he deserves all six, if not more.One thing I didn't like about Closer is the fact that it seemed to be rather long (reminded me of both Contempt and Solaris). It's less than 100 minutes, but seemed longer. However, the simple (yet complex) story is sustained for that runtime, making Closer a great, challenging film to watch-there's some explicitness in it that wasn't necessary, but if you can get through that, I think Closer will offer a complex night at the movies.My rating: 8/10Rated R for sequences of graphic sexual dialogue, nudity/sexuality and language.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
As time goes by,"The movie is awesome. Indeed it's a more mileage viewer that can appreciate all the turns and follow them. But the film did make it. It was long enough to put me to sleep, like some movies used to, but I was alert and present till the final titles. Julia's had all my prejudices. A famous, rich actress, working out on her potential potency. She used to be young, fresh and charming, but now the time for the characteristic roles had come. I was wrong. Julia's the jewel, which never loses its light and magnetism. Her soft smiles, barely distinguishable changes in the sculpture of her face are amazing. While watching the film I had a notion that most of time she wouldn't have dared speak. Her presence was her language. And I must confess I was wrong about her acting powers and abilities. Sorry Julia. Ms. Portman I've already seen in, say a movie span. She's grown older now to her advantage and created some real beautiful moments. The moments came and passed and after I left the theatre behind me, I realized that there's much for her to reach for and attain. With all her beautiful face, charming and suggestive pronunciation, she needs time to lift us up where we belong. In the movie she somehow reached the peaks and all of a sudden got tuned down for reasons unknown. Jude was good but for my taste his acting was too soft...womanish-like. His counterpart has been great especially while typing on his laptop to an unknown adventurous girl. Whoa. That was an adventure. It's hard to get a clear message from the film, and it's good. Life doesn't offer clear messages. From the other hand I am not sure if leaving a viewer at large, with hints uncertain should be considered a proper thing. Well...at least we might discover another angle while watching our lives, cause the movie's definitely not another cliff-hanger to see us fall. The time will tell.

Mona Lisa is not smiling,"The film ""Closer"" prominently features music from Mozart's opera, ""Cosi Fan Tutti."" The title does not translate into English too well but it is usually translated as ""they are all like that."" The opera is about 2 couples that swap lovers on a bet in order to prove that women are unfaithful by nature. At the end of the opera the men don't come off looking any better than the women. The opera is a comedy; this film is not.""Closer"" is basically a filmed play. All the drama comes from the dialog. If you liked ""The Hours,"" ""We Don't Live Here Anymore,"" and ""21 Grams,"" then you will probably like ""Closer."" If you are not comfortable peering into the dark side of human nature and the sadistic side of sexuality, you should not see this film. This is a film about people who are beautiful on the outside and ugly on the inside.This is an art film. It uses an interesting device of skipping large amounts of time without telling the viewer. You find out in the dialog that the film has suddenly skipped ahead a year or more. This is a challenging film that requires the viewer actively think during the entire film and especially at the ending. If you go to movies in order to stop thinking, you will probably not like this film. Also, if you are offended by graphic sexual dialog, do not see this film. The dialog in this film makes ""Kinsey"" seem tame by comparison. If you have trouble figuring out the ending, remember that the names at the memorial were people who died saving children and ""truth is what separates us from the animals."" Afterwards, you can decide who was the most manipulative character in the film.The cinematography and the dialog are some of the best I've seen in several years. We get so few adult oriented films these days; you should catch this one on the big screen while you have the chance. This is a rare opportunity to see some real literary emotional drama. It is a film that keeps you thinking after you leave the theater. This gets a 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
crossbreeding,"The subtext of homo-eroticism by proxy drives this film. What forces these men to obsessively cling to hopelessly frayed relationships is that they are then erotically bound to each other without ever touching. A brilliant idea brilliantly conceived by Patrick Marber. Mike Nichols, as in Who's Afraid Of Virginia Woolf? and Carnal Knowledge, nails the irony of sex and love: men and women live in different Universes. And how about the small miracle of a sex-drenched movie without a single embarrassing, artsy scene of sweaty, writhing copulators?

A story of two husbands who scheme to test their wives fidelity, and then are shocked to find that women cheat as much as men.As some points in this movie , you may slap your head and say ""Whoa, now they're doing what??""

Painfully Pretentious Rot,"Tedious, painfully pretentious rot about four shallow, self-abased people self-deluded and made miserable by their pursuit of rutting and by their crippling nonsense of their self-importance, self-involvement, and self-gratification (perhaps the result of education having abdicated its 'mission civilisatrice' and descended, from the early 1970's, from educating to the mistaken imbuement of - ahem - self-esteem).The characters exist in a rarefied state absent of family, friends, coworkers and, for that matter, the whole, real world. 'Closer' is really Farther - from each other as whole, thinking, feeling humans. 'Closer' redeems nothing and no one, unlike the still-reigning champion of human relationship films: 1963's 'This Sporting Life.'Is there a rating lower than Zero Stars? - because that's what I'd consign to this from-the-get-go crippled film which seeks, it seems, to cripple others by stabbing them in the face with its paean to self-gratification.

"we're happy, aren't we?","Dan makes eye contact with Alice on the street. They fall in love and end up living together, through a brief detour to the emergency room. Larry and Anna are the victims of a practical joke, a potentially illicit encounter becoming acute public embarrassment. But Larry's rough charm wins through and Anna is won over. Or is she?Patrick Marber's screenplay of his own play wears its stage origins on its sleeve. Scenes take place in one room, with little or no inter-cutting between locations. People talk a lot. But it works, because the emotions seem authentic, and the observations acute.The main device is not to lead up to and reveal major decisions, but to join the action when the characters are dealing with the consequences of that decision. You have to pay attention as often you find yourself playing catch-up with the characters.Julia Roberts is as impressive as she has ever been as depressive Anna. Larry figures out she can only be happy by making herself unhappy, and that is the key to his victory. It is the antagonism between the two males that drives the drama. ""I could take him in a scrap"" says Larry, and his confidence is not misplaced. Natalie Portman as Alice is woman with a past, one she is forced to re-visit when Dan's cruelty reaches its zenith. She has her own battle with misanthropic Dan to sort out.You can see why the actors were attracted to this - Marber's script calls on them to act and react, to the petty and stupendous cruelties that all of us recognise from our own lives. They do the material ample justice. Nichols directs unobtrusively, perhaps pipped for a medal here by writer, actors, and editor.Compulsive viewing, though one to watch with the love of your life.",,Anonymous,Romance

Natalie Portman-superb-there were some comments below about her being immature etc-SHE PLAYS A 21 YEAR OLD! She played her role to the tee, slightly naive, a bit Lolitaish and very vulnerable. I've sen Clive in other movies, and this is his best so far. I am glad he had it in him-the well meaning Neanderthal. The other two-I would give them a B+. I guess Jude has always done well as a narcissist, perhaps it's the dependent part of him in this movie that was a little shaky. So, to summarize -go see this, it will exceed your expectations.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
The Best Film I've Seen In A Long Time...,"Closer tells the story of four people - Dan, an obituary writer and failed novelist played by Jude Law, Larry, a dermatologist played by Clive Owen, Alice, a drifter and stripper played by Natalie Portman and Anna, a photographer played by Julia Roberts - whose love lives are all in someway connected. Dan is dating Alice but is 'in love' with Anna who is dating Larry after meeting him in an aquarium as a result of a joke Dan played. The story follows their relationships over four years, through deceptions, marriage, affairs and more deceptions.After seeing the trailer for this film in September last year, I've had very high hopes for it. I can say quite happily that I was not disappointed . Closer is a modern classic, brilliantly acted by a very capable cast and wonderfully scripted. The film moves seamlessly from one tragedy to another. It's a brave movie in many ways, never afraid to be blunt about the characters sex lives, therefore it's not for everyone. The language is very graphic with at least 5 uses of the C word (and I don't mean clean). It's true what the professional reviews/cast have said, you do find your allegiance switching throughout the film and by the end of it you find yourself wondering if any of them deserved your sympathy at all.The acting is amazing. The cast work brilliantly together. If Clive Owen doesn't win the Oscar then someone needs shooting. His performance was the strongest out of an incredibly strong cast. Julia Roberts was excellent as the woman torn between two men. Natalie Portman was as per usual wonderful and very convincing. Jude Law was back on top form after a string of crowd-pleasing but not critic pleasing films. He was completely believable as Dan and this film should silence those who think he's lost his touch.As the end credits rolled and the hauntingly beautiful Blowers Daughter was played, I found myself realizing I'd just watched the best film I'd seen in a hell of a long time. It was worth everything I had to do to see it and I will definitely be buying the DVD! 5/5",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
I really cannot decide...,"During the movie, I found myself itching for the next scene. But for some reason, at the very end of the movie, I was thinking that I was bored during the movie. Now that it has been a while and I have thought a lot about the occurrences in the movie, I really understand how interesting it really is. I agree that everyone behind the movie put every actor to the test. They were put into dangerous, seductive roles, and I really have different opinions about the actors. Some are good, some are bad, but I cannot say who and why. But all I can say is that every actor must have grown during this experience. I still am not sure of my opinion of this movie, but I think that if you seem to be one bit interested in the movie you should go and see it, definitely.",,Anonymous,Romance
Truly honest and interesting,"Closer is innovating. It tells a story about love, betrayal, attraction and sex. But it tells it like no other movie, because it shows how things are, raw...The beginning might confuse you, since there is no sense of time in this movie and it is not for every one, because it's not adorable... The love stories are complicated as real life is, and the language is strong and straight forward. It doesn't flower the subject, that's for sure.. and that's why the movie is so interesting.The cast is amazing. I don't like Julia Roberts that much, but she gets her job done beautifully despite being outshone in every scene by the other actors. Jude Law is great. But Clive Owen and Natalie Portman are breath taking. Their characters are the most complicated, but they really captured their essence! Clive Owen as the rude Larry, who despite it's manners is the character I liked the best, because he's the most honest and human one. Natalie Portman is simply amazing. She plays a character so complex, that everyone sympathizes with her immediately.So remember, this is not a pretty romance. It has no flowers or sunshines... Only emotions! Watch it, its honesty will surprise you.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
"A disturbing, emotional, powerful, and yet a wonderful film of 2004","I rented Closer yesterday along with other films and I got to watch Closer last night. I heard that this 104 minute film was really good and I've always wanted to see it, so I finally got to watch it. This was a great film from start to finish. The performances were very good and Clive Owen and Natalie Portman were the best of them, delivering powerful performances. Even though in the film you really won't like the characters, the character development sure puts you in the mood, watching these characters fall apart over each other. The soundtrack to the movie was also great and the song, ""The Blower's Daughter,"" by Damien Rice is an excellent song. Overall, a disturbing film to watch and listen too about the characters, but yet a wonderful film to see, which everyone should see.Hedeen's Outlook: 9/10 ***+ A-",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Simply.. Well Done!,"I am not maybe writing a useful comment for those who didn't see the movie. Its August 2008, the film has been released 4 years ago. I saw it in 2005- and enjoyed it, and I switched on the TV last night and was happy to sit and watch it, again, for the 3rd time actually. And not so many movies that you see again and again and even like them more, the more you watch and older you get.A great film about relationships (love, sex, betrayal, etc). I think Closer, together with Eyes Wide Shut are among the very important and great movies that deal with relationships, in our time. One is set in NY, the other in London- well, last scene again in NY.The acting is So strong and they all fit together. Little things that you appreciate more as you watch again and again. The scene where Alice and Dan are breaking up, after confessing his affair with Anna. This scene is just great. the lines here- and through out the whole movie are just great. Portman delivers a great performance. when she asks him if he brought her to their house, then she says ""you are a piece of sh!t"" she is amazing. then when she asks him if he still fancies her. Again the scene where Anna is telling her husband about her affair, where he is asking her how the sex was. so realistic, and so well done. when he asks her if they had sex at their place and where.. then she pauses, swallows, and say ""there.."" (and I am not a big fan of Roberts). Clive is great as well. Portman in the room at the strip club.. her lines and her performance. when she keeps saying Thank You. (and she is adorable as well) the whole cast just fit together and have great chemistry that you can't believe that they all actually didn't fall in love or had crushes on each other. The editing is great, the rhythm and pace of the film. Everything just makes you sit and enjoy, and feel respected by the makers of this film. In some weak(e r) movies, the lines are misleading or not making much sense that you don't buy it at the end of the movie. Here, you finish watching and start wondering about the characters real emotions, motives, if they really did this and that, if they meant so and so.. so much to analyze and think about. The characters are 3 dimensional. and complex.The film starts with the Line ""Hello Stranger"" It closes with ""Welcome back Ms Jones""The last scene with Portman- such a beauty- crossing 47th street in Manhattan, the lights are-again- red... it all might start over again..!?

"Juvenile, amateur & uninsightful","Watching this film 20 years after it was released, I am BAFFLED that it won awards.The script is weak: stilted dialogue between unlikeable 2D characters. The writer provides no evidence he understand much about human beings, sex, love or relationships.Most of the actors are better than the material they've been given. We know this from their other work - not so much from this. The only glimpses of brilliance are from Julia Roberts who brings some warmth and emotion to the role, despite the flat, uninsightful character she plays.All I can assume is that the rough language shocked contemporary audiences into thinking this was something edgy and progressive. It isn't.",4.0,Anonymous,Romance
A tangled web of lives.,"This movie is a delight to watch. Never a dull moment. Intelligent dialogue between the characters. Awesome acting. Before seeing this movie, I didn't know what to expect of Natalie Portman. After seeing this movie, I have to say that she IS a really fine actress. She's all grown up! But the other actors in the film were never outshone. Jude Law, Julia Roberts, and Clive Owen were all superb.The stars literally and figuratively aligned when they decided to make this film. The acting and story of the film complemented each other magnificently. Unfortunately one cannot say the same for the film's four main characters. It is from this relationship where the beauty of the film lies. Watching these four people's lives get intertwined inside love's cruel web was like a sin that is hard to resist. Go see the movie and the small surprise in the end will definitely make you say ""Forgive me!"". Bring a date if you must. But prepare to explain yourself afterwards.",,Anonymous,Romance
Tired formulaic drama enlivened by excellent acting (J.R. excepted),"To be honest, I was a bit disappointed by this movie. It was rich, stupid people acting stupidly and self-indulgently and then wondering why they hurt. That said, the acting, Julia Roberts excepted, is cathartic and rescues what could be a dull, particularly inert, self- indulgent film. From glancing over several of the comments, this film apparently first existed as a play. This seems sensible; the film is set in close quarters and thereby its existence as a play seems sensible. Two of the characters I found sympathy for and two of them I found really abhorrent. Julia Roberts' Anna is an artist who has very little will of her own. Jude Law is a deceitful, manipulative con-man struggling journalist named Dan who will engage in almost any ruse to get a woman in bed. Natalie Portman's Alice is a free-spirited stripper who is open-minded but ultimately lonely and while she might be able to maintain her independence and playfulness for some time, makes bad decisions in the end based on her need for companionship. Finally, Clive Owen's Larry is a blunt-speaking doctor who is possibly honest to a fault. He outlines his love for a woman also too early and his seemingly deep wells of passion possibly unnerve women who look for an ulterior motive when he is really just a straight-shooter. Initially, Dan charms Alice and they stay together for some while. However, on a routine errand, Dan becomes involved with Anna and while she seems uncomfortable with the arrangement, they nevertheless become involved in a high-wire particularly explosive relationship. Larry is a rock but flirts with Alice after learning where she works from speaking to Anna. Their interaction is flirtatious and electric, indeed, this reflecting on the stellar abilities of Owen and Portman, but not combustible. This is just flirting by people who are very good at it. Their relationship is consequently not as fiery or combative. In contrast, the tempestuousness of Dan and Anna's relationship and their dishonesty with their partners takes a toll on them and their relationship.The endgame seems to be a fair resolution of their behavior up to that point. The performances are all fantastic, except, as mentioned Julia Roberts. She seems to have only one mode in this film and it is morose. While of course that is fine for some of the film, there are electric moments of transcendence and passion when it would seem that her million-dollar grin and some of her famous charm might have made more of a display. Clive Owen lends a great deal of honesty, charm, and possibly desperation underlying it all, and Natalie Portman is electric as a vivacious and charismatic, if achingly insecure girl. Jude Law has never played such a deplorable character. His character is such a chauvinistic, two-faced cad one wonders that any woman would be deceived. However, it is testament to the desperation of the female characters in the movie and Law's considerable charm that he is able to sell this combination of characteristics as a successful ladies' man.Again, the story is rather formulaic-successful if conflicted people who behave as though they own the world and take chances with other peoples' hearts and then are surprised when they find themselves in pain and hurting others. However, as mentioned (and the directing is good. Mike Nichols allows his talented actors to work their magic here and lets the story tell itself) the galvanic acting ultimately distinguishes this film.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Not a Rom Com,"I saw this film many years ago and it stuck with me long after. Firstly as my opening review title signifies, this is most definately NOT from com feel good chick flick. (Forgive the terminology but this is usually the description utilised for a happy rom com). Well this isn't that, its deep and thought provoking and holds many facets far far and away from such a genre stereotypical genre. In summary, this could have been a really good film if it wasn't for the gutter, crass and very frequent and totally unnecessary language. All in all it's a nearly great film and quite unique. It may make you appreciate what you have rather than what you desire. Just a shame about the needless porn language, it runs the film and totally restricts the audience that would have given this a far ""closer"" look of it weren't for the totally totally unnecessary frequent dialogue.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

"Boredom, misery,","A relentlessly dull film. Taken from a stage play all scenes are interiors, and the characters are equally relentlessly dull. Self-obsessed, obsessively egocentric, lacking any sense of love, truth, beauty, anything. Emotional adolescents if that they masturbate (emotionally and undoubtedly physically) their ways through their horribly dull lives. God help us if it reflects modern life - it sure as Hell ain't mine! I can only think that it has been nominated for awards by people who think they should be impressed. Maybe it's an art film?

Quadrangles are more fun,"(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book ""Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!"" Get it at Amazon.)Okay, let's get something straight right away. If you cheat on your partner, you do NOT tell. In fact, if you are asked about who you slept with in the past, you do not tell. Even in junior high school you learned, you do not kiss and tell.Cheating is the big lie. This movie is about cheating and lying. People cheat. They get tempted. They want excitement. People are animals. But it is worse than adding insult to injury if you cheat and tell. Don't cheat. But if you do, don't tell.This is a clever--although I wouldn't call it slick--film about how attractive people of a certain age and milieu are always hitting on and being hit upon. It is about the shallowness of love and the urgency of sex. It is about pretty people on the screen fulfilling fantasies. The dialogue is hip, sharp, although sometimes too cute and superficial.It is stylish and ephemeral. It has the facade of realism. Note that none of the characters have children and none of them are trying to save the world. They are sexual and emotional hedonists, and maybe they are saying something about our times, in the big cities of the Western world at the dawn of the new millennium. On the other hand, they are urban professionals, skillfully navigating their way through the urban jungle toward a life of fulfillment and meaning... Well, maybe not.But the emotions that the characters experience are very real. When you love someone and that someone sleeps with your rival, it is very painful. And when you love someone and you find that that someone doesn't love you, it is very painful. But the psychological pain that is visited upon us at such times is also ephemeral and will pass.If you live on a farm in the middle of Nebraska, Jude Law is not going to kiss you and tempt you into cheating on your husband even if you are as pretty as Julia Roberts. If you really are a plain Jane without style or looks, Clive Owen is going to pass you by as you sit in the aquarium. He'll study the fish. So this is really about Hollywood itself (although set in London) and the usual musical beds. This is TV's ""Friends"" in the raw. This is Mike Nichols updating Carnal Knowledge, his very sixties-ish quadrangle film released in 1971 starring Jack Nicholson, Art Garfunkel, Ann-Margret and Candice Bergen. As in Carnal Knowledge--and, by the way, in Milan Kundera's novel The Unbearable Lightness of Being (made into a film starring Juliette Binoche)--there are four attractive, sexually active people who can't keep their hands off of one another. If you liked triangles, you randy geometricians, you'll really love quads, seems to be the thinking here.Well, I did kind of like this film. What's not to like about Natalie Portman, Julia Roberts, Jude Law and Clive Owen? They are attractive and they are talented. The script from Patrick Marber adapting his play of the same name (with some very real influence from Milan Kundera's novel: note that in both cases there is a doctor and one of the women is in the sexual professions and the other is either a photographer or a painter) is witty and, yes, sexy. The direction by Mike Nichols (now in his seventies) is a little uneven and sometimes cryptic, especially as regards the ending and the beginning. (Never mind. I would like to discuss the ending, but, alas, that might spoil the film for somebody. As for the ""Boy Meets Girl, Cute"" beginning...well, it was VERY familiar.) But the film is crisply edited and there are no dead spots. You will be entertained, even if you later feel that you got seduced yourself and feel like you just ate a whole box of sugary bon-bons.Irony: while Natalie Portman plays the lower-class stripper, in real life she is (or was) working toward a medical degree at Harvard.And yes, Alice always lies and Larry always tells the truth...well, almost. Alice's character is very complex, but not entirely realized in the film. We are too much distracted by the sexcapades and the other personalities to see her as clearly as we might. Portman does a good job in a challenging role. There is something almost pathological about Alice that Portman conveys with modulated swings in mood and expression. Larry, the doc, is, as he tells us, the caveman, while Dan is the emotional pretty boy. And Anna...well, Anna is smart and has a deeper appreciation than the other characters of who she is and what she wants. And she does manage to get what she wants.See this for Mike Nichols whose credits include Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf (1966), The Graduate (1967), Silkwood (1983), Postcards from the Edge (1990), and a number of other very successful films. In Closer, he shows once again that he still knows what interests the current generation.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

Fascinating...not perfect but a smart adult film,"I think the film is wonderful. I'm not a critic and I don't particularly care to play one and pontificate, but I will say Clive Owens is amazing. Horrifying, fascinating. OK, it may be a little cliché, at this point, for a modern Londoner to be that fixated on being ""working class."" Sure, it's not out of the question, but it's a little overdone at this point. It does give his character motivation, sure, anger and complexity...but it's so over-used.However, the last scene, where Portman's character walks through Times Sq, with men looking at her left and right, and she looking straight ahead, is one of the most poignantly tragic, beautifully understated scenes I've ever seen. That scene alone. Wow. Although I'm still not sure what ""Blower's Daughter"" means...",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Perfect.,"Fairy tales aside, this film takes a realistic look at modern relationships. It is honest, accurate, and shows the brutal side to relationships.The cast for the film was perfect. It's hard to imagine anyone else being cast in the four roles in this film because Clive Owen, Jude Law, Julia Roberts and Natalie Portman worked so well together. This helped the film seem all the more realistic and believable. Clive Owen in particular was excellent as Larry. In a stage production of Closer, Owen actually took on the role of Dan, which is hard to imagine after seeing how well he played Larry.Patrick Marber's script is magnificently written. The whole film is a string of conversations made up of memorable quotes. The explicit language made it all the more better as it showed just how love effects people and their actions.I gave this film such a high rating because for the type of film it is, it is perfect in every way. 7.3 does not do it justice.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Why does everyone love this film?,"I went to see this film out of recommendation from several of my friends and the excellent reviews it had received in the press. I can honestly say I have never been so let down by a film since I walked out of ""Eyes Wide Shut"". The performances of each leading actor were wooden, unrealistic and with the exception of Jude Law (who I have yet to see a performance to justify the hype) I really would of expected better- especially from the increasingly excellent Natalie Portman. This film has a go at what could be an excellent storyline, but by halfway through has disintegrated into a mish-mash of unnecessary obscenity and filth. None of the characters are believable, and the jerky, unconnected plot fights tooth and nail to try and hold the whole sorry mess together. Sadly by a third of the way through, it has lost a very difficult battle. I am most sorry I wasted 2 hours of my life on this film. If you have yet to go and see it, save your money.

Love Hurts,"CLOSER (2004) *** Julia Roberts, Jude Law, Clive Owen, Natalie Portman. Well acted character study about four dysfunctional people intertwined over an in determinant time period where coupling, sexual proclivities and good old fashioned mindfucking congeal in an absorbing yet exhausting look at just how predatory humans can be and how love has no business with sex. Director Mike Nichols weaves a finely stitched tapestry of emotional wrenching with a strongly acted chamber piece by his quartet of thespians each displaying nuanced, finely tuned shadings to their duplicitous and at times shockingly indifferent attitudes particularly Owen and Portman, the latter in arguably her finest 'adult' turn yet.Adapted for the screen by Patrick Marber based on his acclaimed British play the film only suffers in its unyielding angst and anomie in its sophisticated trappings.

"Powerful film,, unlikeable characters but true to heart","Mike Nichols has done it again.He has created an emotional, unpredictable and heart-numbing portrayal of 4 people; two of whom decide to be with someone else. The film is filled with very sexual and adult-oriented dialogue. This is not a film for Mom and Pops . I thought Jude Law and Clive Owen were great, and Natalie Portman certainly followed suit. I was a little surprised to see her playing a stripper since she really didn't look like one- a retail worker or another profession of some sort would of been more believable. However, I thought Julia Roberts was horribly miscast for the role of Anna. She did not have the sex appeal nor image the role required. I tend to be a little prejudiced towards Ms. Roberts since I rarely see her in a role that fits her; this role would of been better filled by Naomi Watts or a ""real"" blonde with sex appeal. I don't understand why two American actresses were casted rather than two British actresses since the film takes place in London. I just thought characters would of been better pieced together had they all been British.

"Love, lust and lies","Closer is a story of four people, love and lust. First we meet Dan (Jude Law) and Alice (Natalie Portman) who accidentally run into each other in London. After a while we meet a photographer Anna (Julia Roberts) who becomes an obsession to Dan. Dan's obsession accidentally leads Anna to meet Larry (Clive Owen), who eventually get married. Love, lust and lies surround the lives of these four young people - but who in the end was the biggest liar?Closer is a well-written story with professional and charismatic cast. The two above all else are Clive Owen and Natalie Portman. Their work in this movie is incredible. Clive Owen - such a nice and charming man in many of his other movies - releases his dark side and shows how disgusting men can really be. His portrayal of the Doctor Larry is brilliantly ugly.Natalie Portman shows she can be something else than just Queen Amidala of Naboo (Star Wars Episodes 1-3). Her character is the youngest of the four, but she brings Alice the same kind of warmth, but toughness and also professional touch she showed as Mathilda in Leon.Closer is an amazing movie, even though some parts are not pretty. It brings forward the dark side of people, the side that is usually kept hiding. As a story it is tough, but the revelation in the end lightened up the story a bit, making things something different than the viewer is made originally think.Don't watch this movie when you're depressed, or are having difficulties with your partner!",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
It was all about the sound track,"I was taken, in the first place, by the sound track. I did not care anymore what that movie was all about, just by watching them and listening to the music, which was all over the room. I was watching, carefully. But at that moment, even if I did not enjoy the story, the music had already taken me to the state of mind where I was supposed to be. So, this is what happened: I was taken and driven for the rest of the movie.I just wondered, during the entire exhibition, I was somewhere else, somewhere really close to real life, where men and women behave in a truth way. The movie was real, concerning either men or women. Most of the times I felt like Natalie's character, crying to keep the one she knew she loved; sometimes I felt like Julia, a developed woman who knows what she wants, and who knows how to get there. But no one did really, getting there, except for the skin doctor, the only who worked with rationality as his background.If the movie doesn't leave a final moral message, that is because life is not like that either. Life does not leave a final message. We have to read it in between. We act, we react, and that is all life is all about.I was just in doubt about the fact ""Alice"" lies about her name the whole movie. She just reveals it to the doctor. I couldn't get the signs. Just thought that, sometimes, the mystery is what takes a man interested.

A sad waste...,"When I first saw the trailers, I thought I would be in for a gripping, heart-touching, mysterious romance.

""Julia Roberts looked pretty, but other than that..."" ""What was Mike Nichols thinking?""One of my least-favorite plot mechanisms in books or movies is what I call the ""never-ending downward spiral of misery, ending without hope"". This film embodies that. All the characters start out fairly miserable, and wind up worse, without a shred of potential for a hopeful future.

This movie is not a chick-flick.,"I watched this film at a sneak-preview tonite. The story follows the lives of four people (2 male, 2 female) as they meet and interact in friendship and ""romance"". I use the quotes because this is about struggle more than anything. The darkness of the characters' lives and their struggle is somewhat borne out by the dreary weather of London (the setting). While most films about struggle invite the viewer to empathize with at least one character, this one offers no such invitation. We care very little for any of the four, especially by the end of the film. There is no love story here, only painful emotion, foul language, and deep sorrow. I'm dubbing this one the Anti-Chick-Flick Chick-Flick.

In The Name Of Truth,"""Closer"" is a film that inescapably feels like a work by David Mamet. It is very wordy. The characters speak their feelings and their words feel important, rife with both surface and underground content. As such, the film is not for everyone. Its stylized conversations can feel artificial, though they are revealing and they honor truth above all else. Patrick Marber crafted the play and this adaptation.As the film follows its characters in and out of relationships, it puts truth on a pedestal, sacrifices its participants on the altar of truth, extracts from them glimpses into the true nature of man and woman.The cast features Julia Roberts, Jude Law, Natalie Portman, and Clive Owen. Who could ask for more? They play four people of principle, who can change course on an emotional dime. Still, games are played between them, trying to save themselves or others from cruel truths. And the truths are always there to be seen if one is watching closely. Director Mike Nichols gives us an unvarnished look into the eyes of his cast.All four protagonists are sadists and masochists, punishing themselves for their perceived sins, punishing each other as well, perhaps as another means of punishing themselves. Natalie Portman's Alice is a real heartbreaker, calling on the slave (to beauty) and the savior in all of us.I am rating this film a ""8"", but I know I will eventually see it multiple times and I expect that grade to increase as its meanings reveal themselves to me. In the service of honesty, I must declare it.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Relationships aren't all fun and games,"Closer is a brutal, uncompromising, sometimes quite witty but most importantly a very sober examination of relationships.Expertly performed by a top notch cast, their characters feel real and authentic in their bravery and utmost cowardice. While the characters aren't fully fleshed out they seem very authentic and may even provoke viewers to examine their own personal lives. The dialog, while pretty rough at times, is also spot on.You really don't know who to hate and who to sympathize with and that's the beauty of the film. The people are so flawed and most likely you're left pitying them instead of despising them. Seldom has a film about relationships left me so stunned and yet so speechless. I find it very hard to put into words why it moves me so. Watching these people rip the guts out of one another in this dry fashion is indeed very sobering.I highly recommend this film but, admittedly, you have to be in the mood for it.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Stripped Down,"I didn't make an effort to see this film in the theatre, and I think now that wasn't such a bad thing. I watched it in the intimacy of my own bedroom, on the closed space of my PC, paying rapt attention to the dialogue coming from my small speakers.This film is a contained universe about a handful of experiences and emotions that connect directly to the heart - which is, in the words of one character, ""A fist wrapped in blood."" There is plenty of verbal blood let here, trust me.The four characters (essentially the entire cast) play a round-robin game of desire, but not a desire born of tenderness. This desire is a battle of power, with it's participants using sex as their favorite weapon. They want to love, but find themselves unable to meet it's stringent requirements. Instead, they settle for sex as a curdled substitute.Clive Owen is visceral, cutting, bestial, and oh-SO-smart. He's a gladiator who wins more often than he loses. He may be cruel - but he's a WINNER - and his enemies will never be allowed to forget that.Julia Roberts is perfectly adequate as a chilly photographer who casually takes, destroys, and doesn't seem to care much about the fall-out. She almost seems to play with men out of profound boredom. If any of these characters can be called amoral, it would be her.Jude Law comes across as an overly sensitive and boneless jerk who can't decide if he loves anyone more than himself. His character behaves like a petulant child, thus in a key scene with Clive Owen's raging animal, one can practically see Law shrink both physically and emotionally. Indeed, he seems almost grateful for the clarity than Owens provides. Law's performance has been criticized, but frankly he plays a diminished character and I suspect that's not the easiest trick for someone as elegant and beautiful him. He deserves credit.Natalie Portman is no longer a little girl. She is heartbreakingly beautiful and articulate, yet her character can't be pinned. In the beginning she begs to be loved, but as her character evolves over the course of the film she learns how to use what the Lord gave her - but perhaps not for good. She is excruciatingly aware of how she affects men. I'm not sure she truly enjoys that power. By the time she is betrayed for the final time, the coquettishness is gone - replaced by a woman who despises the men who desire her.Portman is an actress to contend with. She has a long and bright future ahead of her - and I predict that she will join Roberts as an Oscar winner some day.The final scene of the film, which focuses solely on Portman's character, left me in tears. Of course, those cellos in the beautiful, haunting, and anguished 'theme' song by Damien Rice went a long way toward turning on my waterworks, too.This is a humanist movie. Okay, so it's not a movie that's going to make you feel GOOD about the human condition - but it is one that is truthful about the darker meanings of sex, love, and power.""Closer"" is a MUST-SEE for anyone who cherishes a meaty drama.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
I hated it,"I read a couple of the other reviews and they thought that the negative reviews that this film got were because it was ""shocking"". That isn't the case for me. The movie didn't ""shock"" me, the issue was that it didn't make sense to me. I, for the life of me, couldn't figure out what was going on. Why the characters were behaving the way they were, who liked who...and in some cases, when things were occurring in the time line. The most frustrating part of it to me is the fact that all of the people in this movie, seem to be unsure of what they want and who they are in love with. And even when they are sure, one member of the couple decides that they hate the other, and the whole cycle of angst starts all over again. I like all the actors and actresses in this movie, but I hated the people that they played, and I hated this movie.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
One of the best films I've ever seen...,"Having seen the play of Closer when it was on the stage in the West End many years ago, this film had a lot to live up to in my mind. As a four-hander, I couldn't even imagine how it could be translated into a film, let alone retain the impact of the original. It succeeded on every level.Closer has the ability to take you on an intense and emotional journey with the characters whilst leaving you in the same place as you started. If you are looking for a film to leave you feeling a prescribed way, go see something else; if you are looking for something a bit deeper, see this film and enjoy pondering the nature of people and relationships.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Closer,"Excellent movie with superb acting by all. This film skillfully displays some human emotions which are almost never accurately depicted on film, but somehow this film does it truthfully and painfully. I think much of this movies power comes from the fact that most of us can relate to each and every character and have probably been in many of the same conversations in our lives. Love, Jealousy, Honesty, Infidelity, Sincerity, Sadness, Longing, are laid out in this film like an existential experience as if we are seeing how our own choices and emotions effect ours and our loves ones lives.A really powerful flick without any bells and whistles due to the great acting, dialog, and directing.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
A masterpiece,"I saw Closer for the first time about 7 or 8 months ago. I was in a relationship at the time, and I admired the film for it's accuracy in depicting the lies we tell ourselves, and the ones we are closest to. That relationship ended a week before Christmas - I was dumped. I bought the DVD a few weeks later, and my view of this film was changed entirely.I'm only 16, but every thought and feeling that transpired throughout my relationship (and it's end) was expressed in Closer. I had only been able to relate to certain scenes before, but after the breakup, the film gained new meaning as I individually connected with each character's thought's, feelings, emotions, and even their dirty schemes. However, the film's most important point is never stated, and I understood it the first time I watched it - it's not about love, but what we settle for when love has nothing to do with it.The characters are shockingly deceptive and manipulative. Every relationship is self-effacing, in the respect that they only want the person they're with as long as they're satisfied with them. If true love had any place in this story, then the characters would have never had the desire to leave the person they're with for somebody else. Therefore, the illusion of love has to be kept, which leads to shameless deception and a painful outcome. The only character who might have actually been in love would be Alice, but her needy personality could easily project that illusion, even for me.To call Closer a love story is a misjudgement, and I suspect Patrick Marber knew that when he was writing it. True love has no place in this film, as it doesn't with most relationships we're in, even when we say it does. We find emotional support and personal gratification when we're with somebody, but how often do we find ourselves with people we truly love? Don't we always say we do, even if we don't? The illusion of love will do for most of us, and that's what Closer is all about.P.S. I am personally offended that Patrick Marber didn't receive a Best Adapted Screenplay nomination for this. Who did they nominate that year, anyway?",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Raw and Unfiltered,"I love this film for the real, raw emotion of each character's relationship and interaction with each other as the dynamics morph and change over time. There is a continual cat and mouse game that always leaves you guessing as to how much another character knows of their lover. The unfiltered dialogue in how modern relationships play out in today's society I feel has rarely been shown in mainstream films prior to this movie's arrival and it is refreshing. I also love the psychology behind each of the characters, their past and how it interacts with each decision they make regarding their love interest (or desires) in the present. There is a dark melancholy humor throughout the movie which plays wonderfully with the mood shifts of each role, and the soundtrack is spot on with each adaptation as well. Brilliantly acted on all parts.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Horrible,"This movie does a fantastic job of showing men at their most carnal and women at their most insecure. In other words it shows, in GRAPHIC detail men and women at their worst. The blurb on the back of the DVD box said that this movie was romantic and witty. Huh? If your idea of romantic is lies and deception and your idea of witty is two men having a vile conversation over the internet, then perhaps this movie is for you. Selfishness, greed, lust, lack of respect, perversion of sex, etc. etc. etc.....you name it, this movie has all the ""best"" that the human race has to offer in the realm of relationships between men and women. I am all for exploration of human relationships in the cinematic arts, but this movie lacked creativity in its effort. Any pervert could have written the worst parts of this script. The language was often totally disgusting and unnecessary. Sorry Mr. Nichols, this movie was just horrible.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
This film dazzled me...,"I have to say, i'm an avid follower of film, and not for a long time have I seen a feature that has made me consider so much about everything I think I know about people. This film really reminded me of the fact that there are people out there who act selfishly and despicably, and it kinda made me feel uncomfortable. Good! This kind of thought provoking film really fills me with excitement. they really don't make many films like this anymore (if they ever did).Bravo to the director, writer, and cast. Natalie Portman in particular acted to a degree i suspected she was capable of but never thought I might see. Truly standout, if she doesn't get an Oscar for this role i'll be severely disappointed. The emotion and edge she gave to her character in ""Garden State"", amongst other films, showed us her talent, but ""Closer"", in my humble opinion, showed her's to be a rare and exciting thing. I am really looking forwards to seeing her continue to this standard in the future.Portman's skills do not detract or overshadow the rest of the cast in any way. Law is as excellent as we have come to expect, taking a truly despicable character who reminds us all a little bit uncomfortably of ourselves (or was it just me?), and leaving us feeling pity for him all the same. He takes a complete bastard and still gives him an emotional side that we can empathise with. Here is a man that has selfishly tried to have it all and has instead lost everything. He is what we have the capacity to be and indeed sometimes are. He is without emotional restraint, a slave to his ever-changing emotions. He truly is a fool in love, or a loving fool...Owen is so much better than I thought he would be. Ashamedly I can only use his work in ""King Arthur"" as a basis for comparison (if I have seen him in something else I can't remember it). That particular ""movie"" was a huge disappointment to me ad Owen didn't do much to further its case. However, a ridiculous script may be more to blame for that particular fiasco than he. However, i freely admit I was most definitely wrong about this actor. His performance in ""Closer"" is a powerhouse of bare emotion and realism which left me heartened that good old Brittannia can still produce actors of this quality. I look forwards with huge enthusiasm to his next offering.It says something about this film that Julia Robert's performance was the worst thing I can pin on it. Her turn, whilst not incredible, is very good. It is definitely what we have come to expect from an actress of her caliber. She acquits herself admirably, showing qualities that are considerably varied from her usual hard-ass or rom-com roles... She doesn't disappoint with a role that simultaneously delivers tones of gritty realism and emotional pain.""Closer"" definitely rates as the best film I have seen from 2004. Outstanding concept, writing, direction and some hugely impressive acting turns from the entire cast will hopefully propel this film to the commercial and critical success that it merits. I urge those who haven't yet seen it to go directly to their nearest cinema and buy a ticket. To those who disliked it or don't understand it, I respect your opinions, but I hope if you give it a second chance that you'll see the genius I see.10/10. The best film I have seen in a long, long time. Thought-provoking, realistic and just thoroughly enjoyable. Bravo!",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Not Your Average Love Story,"'Closer', the new sensual talkative drama from veteran filmmaker Mike Nichols, is adapted from the U.K. originated stage production written by Patrick Marber (who provided the film version with it's screenplay.) You could tell this by not even knowing since the film only has four characters; they are Dan, Alice, Anna and Larry, four seemingly ordinary people caught up in a love rectangle (there's no same sex attraction between them though, just boy-girl stuff). It starts out with Dan (Jude Law), a novelist, who meets a mystery girl, an American teenager, Alice (Natalie Portman) living in London. They hit off, but Dan starts to get bored with Alice and goes for someone his own age, Anna (Julia Roberts), a photographer hired to snap shots for Dan's book cover -- this doesn't sit well with Anna's husband Larry (King Arthur, urrhh, I mean, Clive Owen) who is a wealthy dermatologist.Pretty much the whole film is carried by the characters and their dialogue. The acting is actually something to notice. Jude Law really doesn't stand out like he usually does, and Julia Roberts really chews up the scenery (not in a good way). The two standouts are Natalie Portman and Clive Owen (the two lesser known actors of the bunch). Natalie Portman provides a carefully layered and exquisite performance that rightfully earned her her very first Oscar nomination. But the best performance of the picture is far and away Clive Owen. I never really appreciated how much of an outstanding performer he truly was until this. Clive Owen steals scenes from which ever of the three other characters he's around and he does a dazzling job making us believe how emotionally scarred, complex and scary the character of Larry really is.In 'Closer' the acting is spot-on, and so is the writing for the most part. The dialogue flows smoothly in 'Closer', but some scenes are so graphically laced with outrageously obscene sexual dialogue it will make you think they put it in the film not to help the story but just for the shock value. Mike Nichols does another fine job directing (nothing to hand an Oscar out for), but the film's ending is kind of unclear. I don't want to spoil it for you so I won't mention it.In conclusion, 'Closer' is kind of like the anti-love story. Chances are if you take a first or second date to it they'll slap you in the face. 'Closer' is probably best for people who appreciate the craft of acting, or people who are performers themselves. 'Closer' is definitely worth renting if your not easily offended by vulgar sexual insults. It made my Top 25 list of 2004 at number 25. Grade: B+",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Absolutely Bonkers,"The first few scenes of Closer are slow and seem overly sexual. But hold on, because everything afterwards is just one giant climax.

"And I thought ""Scream"" was the worst movie ever....","... but then I saw this one. Absolutely void of any reason or meaning! On technical aspects the movie might be okay, but it's booooring and extremely repetitive: the author repeats the same sad story over and over again through each of the 4 characters. 1 character with a long monologue would have sufficed, thank you.The person who wrote this story and all of those who can identify themselves with this movie should consult a shrink / sexologists urgently, because they must have one hell of a problem on the relational side. I truly feel sorry for them.As for the cultural value of this movie... I would have given it an absolute 0, but the ranking system only allows for 1 and up... In my opinion it's an absolute waste of resources...It's definitely the worst movie I ever saw...",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
Listen to the Dialogue,"This is a film about four people. Well, there are hardly any other character in the whole film except for bystanders. If you watch this on the big screen, you really would have to pay attention as you would not have the benefit of a re-wind button. Most films use flashbacks. This film uses flash forwards. And it jumps from one time frame to another without the benefit of subtitles or any form of announcement or indication. You just have to listen to the dialogues very carefully. For example, the film begins with the meeting of Natalie Portman and Jude Law. The scene 'ends' with Natalie Portman saying ""My name is Alice"". The next scene 'starts' with Jude Law telling Julia Roberts that he has been living with Natalie Portman for a year. Just one sentence and if you miss that, you would get the whole story absolutely mixed up. This happens throughout the film, in that the scenes are fast forwarded and they usually begin with a sentence from one of the characters. But it is very beautifully done and I enjoy it.Profanity? I do not see the profanity because it is not profanity when the words used are to tell the story. It is not **** for the sake of using the word ****. The graphic use of 'sex' words are to describe incidents or actions. And they have to be used. For example, an angry man who finds out that his girlfriend has slept with another is not going to say ""oh, you made love to him"" but screams ""you ****ed him!"".The only personal comment I would make is that Jude Law tries to justify everything under the sun. As a man, I would probably do the same in his situation but at the same time, it leaves such a bad taste in the mouth that I want to scream ""You hypocritical bastard"" and smash his face in. And in doing so, probably look at myself in the mirror and smash the mirror in... but perhaps my face against the mirror, for being a hypocritical piece of useless claim to manhood when it comes to playing with the feelings of Natalie Portman and Julia Roberts, and along the way, messes up Clive Owen.I recommend this film. But watch it on the DVD so that you may need to re-wind to re-catch certain scenes.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Brutal,"Closer is a brutal tale, with excellent performances from all involved, a musical score that fits like a glove, and photography that beautifully enhances the experience.Still, I can't help but miss the strong realism of creations such as the superb Lost In Translation, where everything combines to make a perfect whole. Closer has many great sides, but there are flaws, such as the feeling that the story attempted to be told is much richer than what we see on screen. There are the missing pieces, the jumps in time, that might have been a good technique had it not left me feeling that the story was chopped up to make it fit a certain time slot.As a whole, Closer was a fresh experience, both with the daring story and the surprisingly strong performances of some of the cast, therefore I gave it:Rating: 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
AWFUL,"Cannot believe I paid money to see this movie. I can't believe that the actors took these parts! This was one of the worst movies I've ever seen.

The only thing that would have redeemed it would be if the characters had all committed suicide at the end of it.

"Pretty good, not great","I am a fan of movies like Welcome to the Dollhouse, In The Company of Men, Friends & Neighbors, Happiness, etc. I often like movies that show some of the ugliness that human beings possess (I know that I am in the minority on that) and that is what I like about Closer. Relationships can be quite pathetic, and this movie explores that. I'd say that, for better and worse, Closer is a slicker, more poetic and less gritty companion to the aforementioned movies.Reading some of the reviews here, I think Julia Roberts and Jude Law drew in some people looking for Pretty Woman II or something.

An Honest look at love and relationships,"I saw Closer yesterday. I can't stop thinking about it. The more time that passes, the more obsessed I am with it's honesty and sincerity.It's not a matter of ""liking"" or ""hating"" the movie as much as it is a matter of understanding. Either you get it, or you don't. The people who have given this movie poor reviews probably just don't get it and understand the beauty in it's complexity, and yet still simplicity.The movie fed you no BS. It wasn't the typical story of ""if you're good and moral than good things happen to you, and if you are bad and immoral than nothing will work out for you"".The entire movie was originally a play, with four characters. The amazing thing to me is that the movie stayed true to the play. With only four characters. No one else was in this movie. Everyone else was extra's with no lines, take away two people who had one line, but that was it.It took place over four years of lies and honesty in all the wrong places. Going from being head over heels in love to lying blatantly to that persons face, and the very real, very human reaction of selfishness. That as much as you love a person and as honest as you may have always been, when you do something wrong, the human reaction is to skip over it, lie, and with a fake smile hope everything works out in the end.For some, it works out in the end. And for others it doesn't.This movie was also honest about sex. What sex means, what sex is, and that we are animals, essentially following a scent to get what we ultimately need to thrive on. Reproduction, or the ultimate form of entertainment - call it what you like. Sex is what makes relationships. It's emotions that are secondary. And often we trick ourselves into thinking that Love is Enough.I left not questioning my relationship, but rather examining it. You leave this movie with a sense of dysfunction and unsettlement. Nothing but disease (and that's dis-ease, not the illness). You can either look at your thoughts as questioning - which is negative, or examining - which is a little more positive. And all I can think is how we just never know who we are sleeping with. And what they are capable of. Do they lie over little things, and if so than do they lie over the big things that we just never find out about? Go see this movie. It's incredibly well done. If you're new to ""love"", my immediate reaction is to say that you won't like it because you just won't understand it. But I think you should see it all the more so you know what you are getting into, and what to avoid at all costs. If you have been in a series of relationships, and had at least one that was dysfunctional (as I firmly believe every relationship has it's dysfunctions - I don't know one relationship that doesn't) than this movie will have you on the edge of your seat. And probably up all night in your own personal study of your own love life, behavior in relationships, and attitude toward your partner. Which I think you will find in the end that while you leave the theatre with the sense of disease, your attitude in the end will change to a higher level of respect.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
And so it is........,"And so it is......just like you said it should be, life goes easy on me, most, of the time.The lyrics of Damien Rice start this great movie about four people who's concept of love and relationships is anything but normal. Let me say this these characters are not good people, they are anything but, however you end up loving them for it because of the realism they represent. Life is not filled with people that always do the right thing that meet a girl get married and have children. The truth is this doesn't happen most of the time and this film shows it to perfection. Julia Roberts who i usually don't like is especially good in this film because she is amazing at supporting the scenes she is in. I hope she chooses to do more movies like this in the future. Jude Law is his usual self charming and kind with a sense of mystery about him that makes you not able to take your eyes off him. BUT MOST OF ALL, the performances of Natalie Portman and Clive Owen are especially well done because they make the film go from great to incredible. Portman gives a performance that mixes the right tone of ""who is she"" and ""But i want her"" while the break out performance that had it been done poorly the film would have been a bust is by Clive Owen. He is a great actor and needs to be used more by the movie making world. These great performances combined with masterful dialog the type you wish you could write if you are a writer but at the same time I often wished i talked this way.

Unlikeable characters in a movie you will love,"This movie is about four of the coldest, cruelest people who will ever meet, trying to experience the joys of love and intimacy. It is set into several scenes showing major changes in the character's relationships. The ""in-between"" parts are never shown. There is little in the way of action and much in the way of dialog. Its origins as a play are very evident. There is hardly anyone else of significance in the movie except these four characters. The writing and acting are engrossing. You will come out of the theater wanting to talk to someone about love, betrayal and relationships. Natalie Portman has grown to be quite and actress. Julia Roberts shows herself here to be capable of more than a pretty smile and lighthearted comedies. Jude Law is very attractive and you can see what these women see in him.

Great Movie,"Although originally written as a play, Closer has transferred itself to the screen very nicely. Patrick Marber does an excellent job with adapting the script, and Mark Nichols does an excellent job at directing this work.The movie's plot was something that you'd expect from a normal drama/romance movie. There were no long-winded sappy breakups, and the standard bedroom scenes were short and sparsely used throughout the movie. Everything in this movie is about the trauma between two couples, Portman (Alice) and Law (Dan) against Roberts (Anna) and Owen (Larry). All the characters in this movie have some emotional instability of some sort; Portman is very much a pushover, Law a very unforgiving stuck-up, Roberts' character isn't faithful to either of the men, and Owen is a pervert who trolls around Internet chartrooms looking for women. However, all of these different faults somehow add to the plot line, making for a very interesting movie. After finishing the movie, you feel the need to question yourself and examine your ""inner self"". Though I wasn't the biggest fan of Julia Roberts in this movie, Natalie Portman did a great job executing her part as a half-girlfriend half-stripper. Both Jude Law and Clive Owen fit their respective parts nicely in the movie.If you're looking for a sappy love movie or a girl-meets-guy chick flick, you should probably stay away from this movie. You'll just end up coming out disappointed, taking in nothing from the movie. However, if you want to see a good movie which will leave you thinking, Closer is for you.+: Good plot; Natalie Portman's a great actress in this movie-: May not be for everyone; Untraditional drama/romance may make some people feel lost in the movie",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

Although sex is not portrayed visually (at least in the first half), it is discussed in graphic detail in a manner that I found to be disgusting and completely offensive.

A Dirty Feeling,"""Closer"" is quite a powerful movie. But I couldn't help but walk out of the movie theater feeling sick to my stomach.Without knowing Nicols' intent, I can only assume that the movie was titled out of irony. As the movie goes on, these 4 characters become more and more alienated and self absorbed; ultimately as a means of emotional self-preservation.But rather than dissect the entire movie, I would prefer to focus on a very captivating sequence between Clive Owens' and Julia Roberts' characters. Roberts reveals that she has recently fallen back into the arms of Jude Law's character, although she and Owens are living together. The banter that ensues is graphic to the point of being disgusting. But there is an undeniable link to an internet ""dirty chat"" between Owens and Law from earlier in the movie. In one setting, this dirty talk was considered provocative, yet an hour later in the movie similar words and phrases were downright degrading.Many facets of adult relationships are examined in ""Closer"". Nichols does a masterful job of showing the duality of sexuality and emotional closeness.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
smart,"""Closer,"" directed by Mike Nichols, is based on the hit London play of the same name. It had English critics insanely enthusiastic, was transported to Broadway and cities around the country. Now, this gem of theatre has turned from play into a movie script, directed with classy , smart, sophistication, but almost cold detachment by Nichols.Just as the Nichols-directed ""Angels in America"" was a decidedly adult affair, so is ""Closer,"" with its graphic sexual language, a raunchy, X-rated Internet flirtation (with the sort of words that would be automatically extinguished by your office computer firewalls) and detour into the world of exotic dancers. Much applause to a brilliant director.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Masterful....hits the viewer like a bolt of lightning!,"Four people, living in London, have mixed luck with romance. One man already has a live-in girlfriend but his eye is on another lady. The other gentleman surfs the Internet, looking for compatible women. One of the ladies has just been separated from her husband and is not interested in romance at the moment. The other lady is a younger woman, from the United States, who is in a loving relationship she thinks will last forever. Their lives all become entangled and turned upside-down throughout the course of the film. Will anyone find happiness? This movie is just spellbinding. The four actors, Owen, Law, Roberts, and Portman give touching, realistic performances as the flawed but undeniably attractive characters. The settings are lovely, the costumes fetching and the script is very truthful and compelling, even thought the language and situations get a bit rough at times. Are you a film fan who must see every top-notch film that is released? Do find this one, you will not want to miss seeing a movie at this fine a level of film-making.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Waste of time,"This movie was a waste of time and money. It was a mindless, distasteful, horribly acted movie. The people who think it portrays real life and real relationships well....my advice would be to, Get a life and leave the porn books behind. Don't go to this movie if you are seeking a good love story. Your stomach will turn with revulsion. If this is the extent of human love and emotion then we are all in sad shape. This is not adult maturity. This is the mind of a rapist. Might as well go hang of the trees with the monkeys.I have to write 10 lines for them to even accept my comment? I can't think of 10 lines to even describe this kind of filth us Americans are becoming accustomed to. I think I would rather prefer the love story of my grandma.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
That was something else...,Wow... I don't even know what to say.I feel like my words can't even describe the feeling I have when I watched this movie. And now I thank that moment when I thought that I'm gonna be watching this movie...I have never even experienced such a feeling like this before. And I don't even think I will.Every single detail was hugely perfect in this movie. I don't even like romance movies a lot. But this one was just so perfect and well-made.I think I just had one of the best calm experiences of my life and I KNOW a lot of people wouldn't agree with me.

An Intriguing Drama,"Closer is not very comfortable viewing. The film is a very rough and raw look at the negative side of relationships. Directed by Mike Nichols, this movie features outstanding performances, a wonderful soundtrack and a great script.Closer follows the relationships of four people, Dan (Jude Law), Alice (Natalie Portman), Anna (Julia Roberts) and Larry (Clive Owen). After Dan helps Alice in an accident he uses her in a novel. A year later Dan is photographed by Anna. They share a kiss. Later, through an internet chat-site prank, Dan gets Alice together with Larry. In the following year they get married and Dan and Alice are together. Here on follows a series of intense break ups and confrontations.Closer is a very black, intriguing comedy/drama. The performances in this movie a brilliant. Natalie Portman is stunning as Alice. Her character is beautiful, deceiving and very kind. Portman's portrayal is great.Julia Roberts is very good as Alice, a very interesting character. She invests her role with such a haunted chill you can't imagine anyone wanting to be with her.Jude Law is quite good as Dan. His character is restless and pathetic, sad and sadistic and is always a crushed romantic.Finally, Clive Owen is pretty much flawless as Larry, a very mean, sadistic, heartless character.This film has some very intense dialogue. There is a certain internet chat-site scene between Dan and Larry that is very comical but extremely crude. Some of confrontations scenes are very harsh. I have never heard the word cum used that much in any movie I have seen. This movie is very entertaining and is almost flawless. My only very minor annoyance is towards the end I found that it was getting a little repetitive.I must say though, this isn't for everyone.4/5.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Interesting relationship dialogue with excellent casting.,"The characters could not have been more perfectly cast. Natalie Portman and Clive Owens characters are amazing. I could watch this over and over again and I am not a person to watch the same movie multiple times unless it's excellent. I wish I had seen this years ago, not certain if it ever made it to the big screen. Definitely recommend it.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
PHEW!!!! What a stinker,"This is the worst movie I have ever seen. How it was voted for ""Golden Globes"" I will never know. What a waste of talent. Please stop making this kind of trash. No plot or story just the Directors weird ideas, which gel like butter on a hot day!!! These are all good actors who should have known better. Its no good having top names if the film stinks!!! Jude Law in particular has now got two flops in a row, this and ""Alfie"". Similarly Clive Owen has now got the same , with this and ""King Arthur"". The blatant use of gratuitous sex and foul language was truly pitiful.Not even worthy of a ""B"" grade movie title. A ""Z"" would be more appropriate. Save your money!!!",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
In my Top 10  Films of All-Time,"I can't find anything wrong about this film. Because I'm not a Julia Roberts fan and usually don't go for the romantic-drama genre, I waited until the DVD release to view the film; I shouldn't have. Closer is wonderfully acted, employs dialog that rings true, and ultimately is able to achieve a powerful narrative rivaled by few other films to date. A masterpiece that will be studied and revered for decades to come.The picture, centrally, deals with the emotions inherent in the modern relationship: trust, betrayal, and vulnerability.Closer probably isn't a good date film, nor even a ""couples"" film, it isn't bubbly. It is, however, the director Nichols' best work to date, which is saying something, remember he was responsible for The Graduate. This movie isn't as culturally significant as The Graduate, but I prefer it nonetheless, as it seems to reflect a more mature and honest view of human relations.And then there is the acting. Clive Owen deserved best actor, Portman gives another outstanding performance, and Jude Law shows, once again, why he's the new Johnny Depp (probably will never get the acclaim he deserves, like Depp, or Pitt for that matter, due to Hollywood hunk-marketing). By the end of the film, none of the characters walks away unblemished, and yet you empathize and identify with all of their faults, as if you can imagine yourself making similar mistakes. Nichols was wise enough to depict the youthful quartet as naive, stupid, cruel, narcissistic and selfish. I suspect this movie hits too close to the bone for some.I have to reiterate, this isn't a happy consumer-land film. This is serious cinema revealing the failings many of us are prone to make while young and searching. I'm glad Hollywood can still make a movie like this. Life isn't a beer commercial and not all of us want trite escapism all the time. Cinema, at its best as in Closer, is capable of achieving so much more. I appreciate a silly genre movie as well as the next person, but sometimes a person wants something with more substance, a film working on a different plane. A film like a good novel, teaching you a little more about yourself and your fellow man.Finally, I have to note the superb, and somewhat risky reliance the filmmakers made using Damien Rice's unforgettable song ""The Blower's Daughter"" to set the tone for the film. The choice was shrewd giving the film a melancholy, but humane, quality of romance.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Brilliant,"This movie is incredible! I love it I just rented it and fell in love! It is so incredibly true. Mike Nichols is a genius! For one Jude Law is amazing he plays his character as if it was really him and that makes him so much more sexy and handsome as he ever was before. Natalie Portman ooh my God! She was a child in the star war movies and now its like she bloomed into an incredible, beautiful, sexy, seducing young woman. She played the part! Clive Owen was also amazing he played a sick pervert but at the same time he wad desirable expectally the fact that he can love! Lastly Julia Roberts as always is incredible but what made her stand out so differently is the way she spoke and selfishly carried herself like this character would I've never seen Julia like this and thats why I am captivated by her performance! Bravo bravo to the actors and the Director Mike Nichols! Great movie! I could watch it over and over and over!",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Look closer, and you have more than a movie","This is one of those special films you come to respect, and really admire, because of it's truth. With tight performances, from Owen and Portman (especially Owen) these are reasons Closer really works. The film is about infidelity but what ""real love"" is, and it's own underhanded way, challenges us, through it's great screenplay and performances. Law's was one I really liked, as a nerdy, conserved type, who writes obituaries, where his contrast comes in the form of his best friend/doctor, Larry (Owen) the more open, in control, Studley type. Then he (Law) sees her, (Portman) in slow mo, heading towards him, through a bevy of walking New Yorkers. Their mutual attraction is unmistakable, while meanwhile Law is involved with someone else, photographer, Roberts, the least best performance out of the four, where our other three pull higher rank. I don't know, I just didn't like Roberts in this film. It wasn't her acting, but more so her character. Now she's involved in a relationship with Owen, who does Portman. Lucky dog. Confused? Now the movie runs on these four characters, all brought together to create high quality drama, about us as people, taking off the mask, and seeing who we really are. Portman's cruel, blunt honesty, near the end, really opens your eyes, and it's paining, but also, seeing the desperation in Law to save and keep her, where at the end, we find out, she really did need saving. Closer is not the most appealing film, and does have some pretty heavy, coarse language, here and there, but it's an important film. The scene in the strip club between Owen and Portman is gold, my fav, Owen's never been funnier, while Portman, scantily clad, donning a pink wig, has never been hotter. The song a slow sung track is haunting, as in how it painfully befits Law and Portman's short lived relationship, as if torturous too. Though in all, Closer, is a well, fine fashioned film, that must be praised for it's honesty.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Mind Blowing Masterpiece,"Before the credits rolled, I had already begun to rank this as one of my favorite movies. There was a little bit of suspicion in the realm of type-casting. I immediately asked myself how many more romantic roles I could see Julia Roberts in before finally getting tired of it and begging for a Brokavich sequel. However, she fit so superbly well as this character that, typecast or not, I forgot all about 'Runaway Bride' by the first intense scene. And there are quite a few of those in this one. Not having seen Jude Law do any intense acting, I was gladly impressed to discover that he really is a talented actor and not just some boy toy being thrown into practically ever film these days. There actually IS a reason for it. The other Eurpoean sensation in this movie, Clive Owen, also did a smashing job justifying all of the attention suddenly being thrown his way. Men with his attractive features really can be found en masse, but an actor that can control his facial expressions as if they were an etch a sketch for his emotions as he can, really is a rare bird. But my biggest surprise was Natalie Portman. Having never seen Garden State, my only taste of her has been the newer Star Wars movies. So, I thought she was a horrible actress. This movie turned my opinion over her on its head and left me wondering why I hadn't seen this star shine before. In addition to her acting, there's also something else about her that keeps you on edge. It could have just been her character in this particular flick. As the writing was so masterfully crafted, I wouldn't be surprised. The emotional intensity has a lot to do with the acting, but without the right words to deliver, it gets lost. This movie had scenes that left me wanting to slap someone, the were that effective at tugging you into the plot. I was constantly reminded of ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?"", and a guarantee you that closer will one day be just as much a classic.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Great characterisations; enjoyable & believable romance story,"I've got to say, Closer is one of the best films I've seen in a long while. The film stars Jude Law, Natalie Portman, Julia Roberts and Clive Owen and is a deeply insightful, touching and absorbing story of the characters love lives. I think for me the quality of this film was in the acting - some incredibly believable facial expressions and depth of character - especially Clive Owen and even from Julia Roberts; and also in the writing. Anyone who's ever been in love or been through a painful break up can't help but recognise the words, behaviours, feelings and actions of the characters. It is an incredibly accurate representation of modern day relationships, and most impressively it does not to stoop to Hollywood simplicity of ""good"" and ""bad"". It makes no moral judgement on the actions of the characters, and ends the story in a realistic way, not a cheesy happy ending. I can't recommend it enough! Much better than a lot of the American processed crap we've been force-fed lately!",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Brilliant acting,"This film is a great display of how relationships effect people emotionally. The acting was top level and this movie is not catered to Hollywood which is very refreshing. The way these people cope with their feelings is realistic and will take you to the time you felt the same- from both sides of the relationship. Fantastic film, truly an insight into the emotions of people.Natalie Portman and Clive Owen steal the show from the ""better"" known actors and are magnificent to watch. This by no means is a failure on Julia Roberts or Jude Law, who were both stellar, but is just the simple truth to this film.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Very interesting film, full of life, sadness and some love","Closer is the kind of movie you do not expect to see and end thanks for the good decision. The choice of characters is notable, each appear full in their roles, Clive Owen at his best character to my taste. Natalie Portman perform one of the sexiest scenes ever. The plot is fast, sexy and unexpected, if I've to put it in one word,I'd say ecstatic. I enjoy this film from the beginning to the end without any interruption.You end up hoping that does not end, and when it does, you'll stay questioning some things about your own life.N.L.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Shockingly Awful,"For long I've been trying to avoid it, but it finally happened. After rating more than four hundred movies here on IMDb, I've finally watched one that is bad enough to deserve a one star rating. That movie is ""Closer"".It was painful to watch this movie and, by the end of it, I felt genuinely insulted.The plot is so pretentious and vacuous that it makes any relationship adviser writing in a frivolous magazine seem worthy of the Nobel Prize for Literature. Whatever moral imperative or profound realization about relationships between men and women the writer though we were supposed to retain from this terrible movie, it was surely lost amongst the wreckage of inappropriate intensity and unrealistic emotional drivel that dominates this picture.Without exception, all performances were dreadful. When they (the actors) scream, it generally seems unconvincing. When they cry, it usually seems unsuitable and insincere. And whatever expression or gesture they throw at each other during the movie seems contrived, misplaced and sometimes even alien to the scene.Some of the passages and dialogs are so artificial and unrefined that I ended up feeling like I was watching a post-modern porn flick. Yes, it is that bad; a total waste of time, money and a considerable portion of one's mental soberness.I honestly can't believe that this vulgar and revolting film has received an overall 7.4 rating. I guess this world is a lot crazier than I thought.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
