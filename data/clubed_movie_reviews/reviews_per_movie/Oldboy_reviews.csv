Freaked me out,"I haven't written a comment on IMDb for about 3 years but was inspired to with this film. It is not very often that I come across a film by accident (World Movies on cable) and the spend the next day scouring the internet to find out information about it and can't get it out of my head! Anyway, yep there are plot holes, but Old boy borrows a lot from surrealism and you are meant to suspend your disbelief! I don't buy comments when people say ""it is so unrealistic because he should've done this ..."" because it is a surrealist film and meant to be unrealistic! For me the sign of a good film is if it sticks on your head! THis one surely does (althought I did have to look away a few times ... ) Loved it!!!! Work of cruel genius!!!

Absolutely Sublime.......................................................,"I've scored this a 9 but I think I may have been a little harsh! I have just read a review that says the reviewer cannot understand the hype. I can see no hype. Everything the film promised and more was delivered. This is a truly wonderful film. It is beautifully acted, brutally and painstakingly directed and as good a display of raw emotion as I have witnessed in any language. The story is gripping, the characters believable and well rounded, the emotion human and the feeling I was left with at the end of the film is one of awe. And that was after I had watched it twice. Honestly, this is a truly, truly wonderful film. Do not miss it under any circumstances!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
If only we were all living in Asia....,"To start off; This is the one and only film that kept me quiet for a whole 5 mins after seeing it. I literally couldn't close my mouth, and yet there wasn't any sound coming out of it. Oldboy had such an impact on me that words are too little to describe that impact. Therefore this film is definitely in my top 3 films ever made. It belongs there because it has a massive ingredient that a lot of films seem to miss out on; a divine plot. Even though the acting and screenplay are world class, the plot is really the cherry on the cake.When it comes to screenplay Park Chan-Wook is unique (at least for western standards) in his way of filming. The colours are so vivid and it seems like he wanted every shot to be a piece of art. One tip: If you like the shooting in 'Oldboy', have a look at 'Sympathy for Lady Vengeance', the third part in Park's revenge-trilogy. It's even superior to the camera-work in 'Oldboy'. Don't, however, expect a story like Oldboy's, because you would be very disappointed.When it comes to acting and the music, this film is also one of the better films ever made. The music sticks in your head and every time I put in my Oldboy-DVD and the theme-song comes up, I'm just flooded with good memories (even though the plot doesn't have a single reason to be happy about). The characters are also presented very well by the outstanding cast. Especially Choi Min-Sik and Yu Ji-Tae set a very convincing performance.I really appreciate this film being respected as it should be, by having a place in the top 250. If, however, it was up to me it would be even higher in the ranking. I don't see why films like 'The Usual Suspects' or 'Memento', which are fantastic pieces of film-making and which without a doubt deserve a place in the top 250, are higher in the top 250 than 'Oldboy'. They serve the same cause; a fantastic plot. But those plots can't stand in the shadow or even come close to the plot of 'Oldboy'. The one and only reason is that those two films are better known and from a western production company. If we were all living in Asia, no doubt 'Oldboy' would be in the top 20 of all time.My advice to people who haven't watched this film yet: Go see it! This is definitely a must- see. If you have a weak stomach, pull yourself together and still watch it. Don't be as shallow as a lot of people here tend to be. Look beyond the violence and see the things I mentioned before: world class acting, cinematography, music and last but certainly not least the plot. Once you've opened yourself up you'll find a whole new world of cinema. Enjoy!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
You Only Live Once...,"Imagine what you'd do, when you wake from a bad dream, to find you're held by four square walls, for as long as someone deems, no idea why you're trapped, what you've done, why you're kidnapped, just a ceaseless line of dumplings going down your gyoza hatch. Now some fifteen years have passed, every question has been asked, and you're suddenly set free, can start your own avenging spree, before you do you need to feed, by eating something that's in need, so an octopus is ordered, and head first you cross the borders. But things aren't what they might seem, tied and tethered and undreamed, as the puppet master hovers, manipulates what you'll discover.Some films you cannot watch too often and this is one of the greatest pieces of cinematic brilliance ever created.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
Korea's great gift to movie industry,"I don't know why but this movie will always be my favorite. Maybe because of amazing screenplays, very emotional soundtracks or feeling the high tension in every second. I watched so many movies which includes fight scenes. Some of them were good and some of them were bad but in Oldboy... I guess the best describing word is '' real'' about that fight scenes. Because I felt they were. And that scenes are covering about only 2% of the whole movie. Cinemography, perfect harmony of music and scenes, an amazing story and one of the great plot twists in movie history. I am struggling to find the correct words for this movie because this is a movie not a book. And I may easily say it is a masterpiece... I enjoyed the movie with every second of it. I wish there were more movies like Oldboy.But who knows? Maybe there will be...",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
Excellent in it's sickness,"I looked at program for today and I saw movie ""Oldboy"". I read plot and I liked it. What I expected is decent thriller from very good South Korean cinematography,something like ""Salinui chueok "". But once again I was wrong. ""Oldboy"" is masterpiece, so unusual from all other movies. I've seen lots of violence on screen and to me this isn't nothing new but I think that people under 18 really shouldn't watch this one. It's because movie is brutal and I don't think that younger ones would fully understand this one.To say something about plot is quite impossible because I don't know where to begin. If I start talking about the movie I could tell few important things and I know that people often read other comments because they didn't watch that movie. So,I'm going to say only what I read before watching this movie.On his daughter's birthday, Oh Dae-su gets drunk and soon he's arrested by the police. His best friend No Joo-hwan somehow manages to get him out of jail and when No Joo-hwan is making a phone call Oh Dae-su disappears. Someone kidnap's him and puts him into room during 15 long years.But one day he's released.That's the plot. Very interesting, you should watch this movie and then judge it. By the rating on IMDb this movie is in top 250 movies. Now I can understand why. This plot that I wrote doesn't reveal the greatness of the people who wrote the script. I bow to them because this movie is so good, with all those twists and it really represents a whole new wave of making a movie, of writing a script and of acting in it. About direction and actors I can say only good things. Director Park Chan-wook won prize Grand Jury at Cannes. That's enough about direction part. About actors. I can say that I'm impressed by one actor:Choi Min-sik. He's amazing in major role and he showed great potential. I hope I will see him again in some good movie.I cannot say anything more because I could reveal some secret and I don't wanna do that to all new viewers. Only a recommendation. Beautiful, intelligent masterpiece of movie that I highly recommend for everyone with strong stomach and too all of you who want to see one excellent, but sick story. 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
One of most well-made films I've ever seen,"I decided to check this movie out after Ebert's 4 star rave review, and the cult status this movie has received (and was also intrigued by the sexy-looking Ultimate Edition), so I decided to rent it. I was VERY surprised at how different it was than I expected it to be - I expected a ton of violence and not much in the way of writing or acting. The first time I saw it, I wasn't blown away, just kind of like whatever.When I watched it for the second time, however, I really started to notice how well it's made, in addition to liking it more. Every shot is bursting with background detail, a great amount of attention on the production design (the theme of a certain color in a scene was restrained, yet perfectly balanced). The actors really gave it all, especially the 2 male leads who really blew me away. The music is a varied mix of beautiful classical music and some pretty cool techno. The screenplay is brilliant; the characters are developed very well, extremely complex, and the plot is not only ingenious, but the payoff and twists are 1000x better than any Shamaylan movie.Simply put, from a technical point of view, it's one of the best movies ever. From a critic's point of view, it is a very well-done movie that goes a little overboard in sex and violence, and is just a little strange.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
Average revenge film with an extremely weak payoff,"After reading praise after praise about this film on the internet from mostly western viewers (such as the completely clueless Tarantino) and seeing as how it won a major prize at the most recent Cannes Film Festival, my expectations were naturally high when I finally got around to viewing it.I'm sorry to say that I do not share in their optimistic appraisal of this movie.After being imprisoned for 15 years for unknown reasons by an unknown person/persons, Daesu (Min-sik Choi) is naturally a bit upset and is dying to figure out who imprisoned him and why. Borrowing a page from M. Night Shyamalan's guide to movie surprises, writer/director Chan-wook Park (along with 3 other writers) attempts to craft a whodunnit that will keep you guessing and interested until the very end. Well, they only half succeed. I'll admit that I'm normally slow when it comes to movie surprises, but this one jumps out at you as soon as Daesu gets out of prison. It couldn't be more obvious unless the director was sitting next to you whispering it into your ear. From that point on, the movie really begins to drag as we watch Daesu meander from one place to the next in an unfocused attempt to find his enemy and discover the reason behind his imprisonment. Perhaps the main problem with the film is the severe lack of information given to both Daesu and the viewer. Rather than finding out the real truth on his own, he is essentially told everything in the end thanks to a well choreographed monologue. This is not a ""detective""-style story that gives you clues along the way. Some secrets and identities are revealed much too early, leaving only the unknown reason for Daesu's imprisonment the movie's last remaining attempt to keep the viewer interested. When we finally learn of the reason, it's a total letdown and should leave any experienced movie watcher either scratching their heads in total disbelief that someone actually considered this as a basis for a film or make you angry enough to stop the movie right then and there. With the movie's undeniably gritty sense of style and beautiful classical score, this should have been mind blowing. But it's not. It's pathetic. It's obvious the filmmakers really didn't know how to craft a film of this caliber, so they fall back on the ""H"" word (you'll catch the ""H"" word when you hear it in the film) to solve ALL of their screen writing problems.Thankfully the movie does have some positive aspects. The lighting and color scheme really reflect the inner conflicts within Daesu. This is a dark film, and it shows. The cinematography is inventive and vibrant with clever scene transitions and unique movements. The aforementioned score couldn't be better. It's a great mix of classical pieces, original music inspired by classical pieces, and moments of pseudo techno/industrial music, and it certainly does a great job of infusing the viewer with a sense of doubt and depression. Min-sik Choi gives an extremely admirable performance as the mentally conflicted Daesu and handles all kinds of scenes from action to romance with a great sense of confusion and surprise. Finally the relationship between Daesu and the mysterious Mido (Hye-jeong Kang) is really quite touching, allowing for some nice dramatic moments.That being said, it's ashame that the film's story couldn't match its style.Chan-wook Park has directed some of Korea's best and most memorable films in recent memory, such as JSA and Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance, but Old Boy is simply a semi-interesting film. In the realm of revenge flicks, this is perhaps one of the more ambitious (which is definitely a good quality) films out there, but ambition can only get you so far, and Chan-wook Park just can't pull it off. Worth a look for film fans, but it's just not remarkable enough to be recognized on a global scale. Beware before you buy, for you could end up being sorely disappointed as well. 6/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"Pass by the ""Boo"" comments.","After going through the comments, i must say i'm impressed how many people out there don't have a slightest clue of beauty or intelligent screenplays. there are so many comments from people that totally disliked the movie. which is plain and simple not possible, if you got an open mind and a open heart (and are not drunk). I would compare it to chocolate. You may find it too sweet and prefer bitter chocolate. or you like white chocolate more. Or you got diabetes and can only sometimes eat one. But people that totally dislike chocolate scare me to death. Same goes for Oldboy, you gotta admit some of the genius art-form it contains. Its everything in there. Its heartwarming , disgusting, intelligent, beautiful and lead with outstanding performance of any actor . You HAVE to like something, cause it wont get much better. Its chocolate. If you disliked the movie so much and on a constant basis, why even bother to write a comment? My guess is you just could not follow the movie at all. which is my only guess actually. well enough rambling.:::::::::: Bottom Line :::::::::If you call common sense, and a human heart your own and like ""challenging"" movies, go and see it NOW.(i recommend the original korean version with subs)I also recommend the pre- and sequel to this movie. (just browse Chan Wook Park) If you think ""The Fast and the Furious"" is the best movie ever made, please do not even bother to watch Oldboy, and spare others your ""brilliant"" reviews.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
Great film!,"I feel compelled to defend this film from some quite frankly unwarranted criticism. Although it isn't without its flaws, and all films have a few,it certainly isn't a one star film.What this film has is the ability to be sublime, shocking, ridiculous, mildly amusing and visually stunning which is some feat for any film.The sheer scale of the comments here suggests that here is a film that gets to you in one way or another. This film is as far away from Maborosi as you can get yet both films are up there as great pieces of cinema. I wont divulge the plot or end this comment with a Latin quote to reinforce my self importance i'll just say go and watch it, preferably if you're not too squeamish and don't mind subtitles.This film left me thinking about it the following day which is normally a good thing (atleast it shows my memory is working!)",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
As good and disturbing as expected.,"I read the review for ""Oldboy"" a few years ago and have since read praise about the movie from IMDb posters. Often times movies with that kind of hype tend to fall short and is a major disappointment. I don't know anything about Korean cinema so I had fairly low expectations. I had expected it to be a simplistic revenge film, shot in bad film stock. Well I have to say that I'm glad I was wrong, and even gladder still that I actually watched this film.The basic story is that a man named Oh Dae-Su is kidnapped and held captive for 18 years and then released. He has no idea who or why this is being done to him. While in captivity he readies himself for the day when he gets out and take revenge on those who imprisoned him, and to find out why he was imprisoned. So far it sounds just like any old revenge martial art flick and up to this point it pretty much is, but it's incredibly well crafted. I have to admit I have not paid much attention to Asian martial arts films since Bruce Lee died and maybe I should now. Mainly because this movie doesn't have the jumpy camera work, or bad editing of those old flicks. This movie is a crisply shot as any Scorcese film. That alone elevates this movie to a higher plateau.Once he is released, Oh Dae-Su goes on a quest to find what happened to his family and to find the identity of those who had him captured. During the quest for the bad guys, the movie played out like an old fashioned detective movie. The search wasn't rushed and neither was it boring. I suppose the set up made us want to go on this quest with Oh Dae-Su which sounds like Odysseus, and just as Odysseus went on one incredible quest so did Oh Dae-Su.It's when he finds the man who had him held captive that the movie truly departs from being an average revenge film to something that is extra ordinary and extraordinarily disturbing. It's at this point that I have to say that the less said the better. It's something totally out of the ordinary and something that I think will repulse some viewers, but at the same time one can't help have sympathy for all the characters even the man who ordered Oh's incarceration.The acting in the movie is excellent. I had no idea that Korean cinema has such skillful actors. They all really played their part incredibly well. Min-sik Choi, who played Oh Dae-Su was incredible. He goes through the rigors of being a desperate captive, to being a determined man on a mission. Along the way he runs through the gamut of so much emotion and not once did he hit a false note.Overall I have to say that this movie is incredibly well crafted and as good as everybody say, however I find it a little disturbing so I can't give this movie a ten. But don't let my not giving the film a ten scare you away it's a good, enjoyable film.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
One step ahead of America,"Oldboy takes a hammer and ""batters"" its American equivalents, leaving them as pulped as a chewed up squid. Park Chan Wook displays what America misses with his ultra-stylish, ultra-violent thriller. Why watch Ben Affleck fail spectacularly to summon any displayable talent, when Min sik Choi serves up a memorable role as the disturbed, vengeful Dae Su Oh, in the second of the Vengeance trilogy. Park skillfully creates a compelling plot that will have you guessing through the entire film, up until the final shocking revelation. The Cinematography expertly done by Jeong-hun Jeong, who also worked on the follow up to this film, Chinjeolhan geumjassi. Everything about this film is done in style and panache and creates a memorable experience, and has many memorable scenes.Many people accuse this film of being ""unrealistic"". These people forget that this a film, not a documentary. No one complains About Star Wars being unrealistic, and rightly so. Films have a right to stretch out reality, don't forget the reason it does this is to be entertaining.Although the film has strong violence of a graphic nature, I advise you to watch it, if only to broaden your perspectives of world and Asian cinema.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
A masterpiece for the cinema fanatics.,"The first time I watched ""Old-boy"", I was half-amazed, half-disgusted. I wasn't quite sure how to rate the movie in general. I knew 2 things: 1. From a visual point of view, it's one of the best movies I have ever seen. Cinematography & scenography are nothing short of perfection. 2. I had problems with the plot, some holes in it, and a general feeling of injustice, as crime seemed to be pretty lightweight compared with the punishment.2nd time was a weird situation. A girl I knew tried to get into the film school, and the day before her exam she asked me to supply her with some movies that were interesting visually. 2 films we watched were ""Natural Born Killers"" and ""Old-boy"", and, especially the 2nd 1 was a revelation.Knowing the plot, it was easy for me to concentrate on the visual side, and my friend always consumes the movies this way. Results of paying attention to the tiniest of details were stunning. I don't think there's 1 scene in there shot without an idea, without something happening in the background, or without an image responding to the theme of the scene.Don't be a baby crying about violence - camera turns away in key moments. Don't be a smartarse, picking on the shortcomings of the plot - think about Hitchcock or Chaplin and how they gave a flying f... about plot. Appreciate the work of the whole crew, and for best effects watch it a couple of times. It's worth it.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
Disturbing!

Amazing Movie,"Yes this is a twisted movie with plots that unravel slowly and sometimes there are scenes that are slow. But over all it's incredible. Some of the symbolism behind the scenes are stunning. You have to go deep to appreciate it. There is a lot of gore and violence that can turn you off, but I was simply amazed by the depth and width of some of the scenes.Without giving anything away, once the main character is released he meets a man with a dog. It's seems to be an irrelevant scene, but put yourself in a cage for 15 years and think about how you would act? What happens to that man? Isn't he also in a cage? Aren't we all? What is the symbolism of that man? How about the dog? Revenge to the main character in this movie is his life. Why? And you don't question it because you know what happened to him. He doesn't question it either.To me this was one of the greatest depictions of Oedipus or other Greek characters I've seen this decade in a movie. Nothing is new. If you liked ""Requiem for a Dream"" or ""Blue Velvet."" Consider this one.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"

Ugh.,"I saw Old Boy on a grey market DVD about half a year ago and fell asleep during the first twenty minutes. Since then, my friends have literally been begging me to see it to the end, so this Saturday I watched it on the big screen where I had no chance of escape.Boy was that a mistake. Old Boy is by turns idiotic, horrendous and senselessly violent. It lacks the glee of the most basic revenge film. Even Kill Squad did it better.Old Boy simply has no point to speak of. My question is: How did the director and scriptwriter screw up a revenge thriller?Old Boy is very reminiscent of Takashi Miike's far superior Ichi the Killer. The difference between Ichi and Old Boy is one of extremes. Both films revolve around extracting brutal revenge. In this film, the eponymous hero seeks vengeance for fifteen years of imprisonment in a hotel room. In Ichi, Kakihari, a Yakuza enforcer, must track down his kidnapped Boss who may or may not be dead. Both Kakihari and Old Boy use torture to achieve their ends, but in Ichi the violence is committed by such dedicated sadists that it transcends itself and becomes Dionysian. Thusly, Ichi is far more violent than Old Boy, but far more aware. In Old Boy, the violence does nothing but communicate itself as alternately grotesque and depressing.The end of this film is so unbelievable that it made me wonder why they didn't just let a seven year old rewrite it. It was that bad. If you thought the end of Ichi was head-scratching, wait until you see this one. You will feel so betrayed by Old Boy's cop-out you may never want to see another South Korean film again.I think the ridiculous praise this film received (Ebert and Tarantino included) happened because NO ONE was comfortable recommending Ichi. Additionally, Ichi was not distributed theatrically in Ontario (Where I live) and was for a period, even banned.Ichi is a more violent, more difficult film, but it's rewards are far greater than this misdirected piece of trash. How this film ended up at Cannes is beyond me. I think it was because of the reputation of Park Chan's much better ""Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance"".Most likely, nothing I'm going to write here is going to prevent the curious from seeing this film. But if you feel like your time was wasted, don't tell me I didn't warn you.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
More people need to see this film!,"In an age of American cinema where our biggest blockbusters are based on films already successful overseas, this is one movie that needs to be seen by more American movie goers. This is the movie that got me hooked on Asian revenge films. Oldboy is an original movie that shows what happens when a man's freedom is taken away and he doesn't know why, or by whom. He is sudden thrust back into society where he must track down the person that took away his freedom. Along the way come multiple plot twist and surprises that you just don't see coming.It's a shame so many American film goers refuse to see foreign films, because this movie is genius. Who knows, maybe someday the movie will get remade for audiences here in the U.S. and the main character will be played by Mel Gibson or Bruce Willis.

Probably the best Korean movie ever made,"From the ""Vengeance"" trilogy by Pak Chan-wook, Oldboy is probably the best, followed by Sympathy for Lady Vengeance. Simple story, ""low budget"" and actors you already know from Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance. Although I am a fan of Korean movies, when I've heard about this movie and it's plot for the first time, I thought ""oh my god, another sponsored-by-tomato-factory movie"". I watched it for the first time two years after it was released. And to be honest, I was surprised. Since then, I watched this movie more than ten times and I still find it interesting. To me, Oldboy the best Korean movie ever made. Maybe best Asian movie in the last 20 years.I recommend you to watch this, along with Sympathy for Lady Vengeance and Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance.

"Emotional, evocative and excellent.","Old Boy is my favourite film. As far as I can see, no amount of superlatives could explain quite how much I love it. After my first viewing, (all on my lonesome) I realised I probably hadn't blinked during its entirety and I could quite possibly have been burgled during its course and been none the wiser, such was the extent to which I found it totally and utterly engrossing. Obviously a review consisting of very little other than me spewing praise would be a fairly dull read which was why I never bothered to review Old Boy until after my second viewing, with my Po'. My father being the eternal sceptic that he is turned out to be an extremely worthy person to watch the film with, and his response to it opened my eyes a little as to why I love it that much.The plot itself is as follows. The protagonist Oh Dae-Su is one day captured and finds himself locked up in a makeshift prison. After a brief spell of anger and spewing hatred for his captors, he resigns himself to his fate, and after 15 years of shadow boxing and suicide attempts he wakes up from a gas induced coma on top of a tower block where he was initially seized. He then proceeds to try and find out who did this and why, and the film basically charts this quest.The first word that springs to mind when thinking about this film has to be graphic. There are certain scenes which will make those of nervous disposition recoil until they are firmly wedged between the back and seat of their sofa, and they are likely to spend much of the film there as violence is frequent. In most of the extreme cases it is simply the implication of violence and the viewer's imagination when left to its own devices like this will cause its own disgust. This hurdle was a huge thing problem for my dad, who considered some of the violence to be gratuitous, which I can somewhat agree with, although certain scenes are completely integral to the plot. The best way I can justify these scenes is simple. It is all about sending a message, and these do just that. If you can cope with this then you will break down the initial barrier the film leaves lying in the way of your enjoyment.Another barrier will be the massive culture shock experienced when viewing the film. This is a Korean language film adapted from a Japanese animé series, so there are obviously large cultural differences to the western world. Some of the images used will require quite some thought to fully understand, and the script on translation does lose some of its flow, as any animé or graphic novel fans will associate with. For my father, this made it hard for him to settle into the flow of the film, and I can identify with this slightly from my early days of watching animé.Many of the themes you will pick up on and the method of direction is very synonymous with Quentin Tarantino. There are devices used in this film which have obviously taken inspiration from Tarantino's works, in particular the Pulp Fiction- esquire use of camera angles, and the famous dotted line sequence. However, Tarantino is himself a huge fan of Old Boy, being its main advocate to win the 2003 Palme d'Or (where it eventually lost out to Fahrenheit 9/11) and has stated Park Chan-Wook as an influence for his directing style on the Kill Bill series, as well as on his later grindhouse works Death Proof and Planet Terror. Chan-Wook takes on a policy of ""trust the director"", and leaves many questions throughout the film which gives it a somewhat disorientating feel at times. This method of directing can seem quite inaccessible, however all loose ends are tied up very satisfactorily in the enthralling and shocking climax. This is an ending to rival the classic Kaiser Sozé twist in the tail of The Usual Suspects.What really separated and elevates Chan-Wook's work above and beyond Tarantino's however is very simple. Much of Tarantino's work is undertaken as an exercise in direction and film making, and therefore his work can therefore feel shallow. Old Boy however is a film which assesses the deepest corners of the human heart. The middle of three films which make up Chan-Wook's Vengeance Trilogy it is undoubtedly the masterpiece, with a more powerful message than Lady Vengeance and Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance. This film has power because of the depths to which it explores the flaws and forces the human heart possesses, stronger and more destructive than any wisdom can overcome. The performances of the main cast and most importantly the director to send this message to the viewer leave this film as about as close to perfection as I can see any film getting.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
Overrated!!!,"This film is not bad, but does it deserve to be rated as one of the best films of all times? I think not. When rating a film the most important thing should be, what is the film giving the audience and what is the message that the director is pushing across. In this film the message is not much smarter than your average horror flick, and the only feeling you have after seeing it is disgust. That's not really a bad thing, if it has direction. In films like Seven there is and it can be summed up really easy in the last sentences from Morgan Freeman. ""The world is a beautiful place and worth fighting for. I agree with the last part."" Because Oldboy lacks a message like this the whole film becomes an empty vessel.That being say, it might be one of the best empty vessels created. The photography is stunning, the editing is clever and the acting is at most parts really good. The story is smart, but becomes a little to smart at times. It's trying too much to live up to films like Memento, Seven or even The Sixth Sense where everything is revealed in the end. First of all I wasn't that surprised, but the worst part was that I really didn't care.To sum it up: good film, but not even close of being one of the 1000 best films in history.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
Compelling yet disturbing film used as a scapegoat by media,"If you look at the awards this title has won, you will see that critics worldwide rated the film very highly when it came out. The story is one that has already been remade by the Americans - a man is imprisoned for 15 years by someone he has never seen, released - given a cellphone and five days to find out why he was imprisoned and identify his captor. Harrowing, excellent acting with the true horror not coming from guns but from a shocking personal realisation at the end of the film. Sadly, as is always the case after a mass murder, the media and the public are looking for an easy solution as to why Cho Seung-Hui murdered American students on a rampage. He was pictured in poses which the press tagged as those struck in OLDBOY but these are used by any soldier, terrorist or nutter. I'm sorry this film has borne the brunt of the backlash - Cho Seung-Hui was mentally ill - this film did not cause him to go mad, he was sick. Back to the movie, this will stick with viewers after watching. I'm glad to have a DVD copy of it.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
Absolutely authentic and 100% bad ass.,"The first time I saw ""Oldboy"" I watched it by myself on a rainy evening. When the credits rolled at the end I think I actually stood up and clapped. It's been a long time since I've seen something so original. The film is gripping, it grabs and never lets you go.It starts out with a man who is locked inside this room and doesn't know why and blah blah blah...sounds almost cliché. Read the back of the DVD case for a summary. The last fifteen minutes of ""Oldboy"" are the most intense fifteen minutes I've seen in any movie. By the end, you are so eager to know what happened to this poor guy and why he has been punished. And the film takes a twist that makes every hair on your arms stand up and it remains satisfying. It's not one of those twists that leaves you scratching your head. It makes sense! A film like ""Oldboy"" is humbling in that it makes you realize that America is no longer turning out the most cutting-edge stuff. But it's also nice to know that someone out there still has the guts to do a film with no barriers that makes you stand up and flip off guys like Tarantino and go, 'that's what I'm talking about.'10 out of 10, kids.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
OLDBOY. Pure Cinema,"Oldboy is the kind of film that the cinema was invented for. It doesn't patronise or insult it's audience, it keeps the audience on their toes, constantly engaged in suspense, drama and mystery. Watching this film is an emotional roller-coaster. The cinematography is dark, yet breathtaking, the music accompanies all of the drama and action beautiful, in an almost operatic sense. It's graphically violent, but not gratuitously so, the acting is first rate and the plot is intricate, intelligent, filled to the brim with many philosophical and human ideas.It's perfect for multiple viewings, it's a good laugh to watch with your mates, it was desired for the really big screen and the experience of watching OldBoy is unforgettable, right up until the very end. Genre defining, it is Kafka-esquire, it's Hitchcockian, Polaski-esquire and plays out like a modern day Dumas novel, all in one. FIRST RATE. loved it, it is a film that can be classified as just pure cinema.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
A Twisted Web of Vengeance and Intrigue,"Enter the labyrinth of vengeance and psychological intricacy in Park Chan-wook's Oldboy, a film that unfurls like a dark tapestry of torment and retribution. Oldboy is a masterclass in storytelling, weaving a narrative that seamlessly blends elements of mystery, suspense, and psychological horror. The film's visual language creates an atmospheric tension that lingers long after the credits roll. The cinematography is both visceral and poetic, reflecting the duality of the human experience.As a narrative puzzle unfolds, the film explores the fragility of memory, the weight of guilt, and the consequences of revenge. The labyrinthine plot is fraught with unexpected twists that keep the audience on the edge of their seats. It's a story that challenges perceptions, leaving us to question the boundaries of morality and the true cost of justice. The film doesn't shy away from the darker aspects of human nature, confronting the audience with uncomfortable truths that linger in the shadows.From the very first frame, Oldboy plunges its audience into a labyrinthine narrative, where the enigmatic Oh Dae-su, portrayed with raw intensity by Choi Min-sik, finds himself inexplicably imprisoned for 15 years, his only company the haunting memories of an unknown tormentor. Choi Min-sik's portrayal of Dae-su is a tour de force, capturing the relentless determination and psychological toll of a man on a quest for answers. The viewer is held captive by the film's intricate web of suspense, and just when it seems the story's crescendo has been reached, enters the long corridor scene, a feat of cinematic audacity that raises the bar for choreography, cinematography and narrative integration.The corridor fight, which unfolds as a single, unbroken take, is a symphony of brutality choreographed with a rhythmic cadence that juxtaposes grace and violence. As Oh Dae-su unleashes his pent-up fury upon a relentless wave of adversaries, the camera follows his every move with a hypnotic fluidity, transcending the boundaries of conventional filmmaking. This unrelenting shot, lasting a staggering four minutes, immerses the audience into the visceral essence of the struggle, blurring the line between spectator and participant. What sets this scene apart is not merely its technical bravado, but its narrative significance. The corridor, symbolizing the tortuous path of vengeance and redemption, becomes a canvas on which Oh Dae-su's metamorphosis is painted. Each blow and parry is not just physical combat, but a psychological confrontation, a battle against his own demons. Park Chan-wook ingeniously melds form and content, using the corridor as a physical and metaphorical arena for Oh Dae-su's existential ordeal.In an era where filmic excellence often yields to the allure of CGI and contrived action, Oldboy stands as a beacon of authenticity. Its corridor scene, devoid of visual trickery, exalts the art of filmmaking itself, reminding us of the potential for innovation within the boundaries of human creativity.In the Korean cinematic history, Oldboy is more than a fleeting spectacle-they are a magnum opus that reaffirms the power of storytelling, the magic of the moving image, and the unbounded capabilities of a dedicated creative team. As the corridor becomes a stage for Oh Dae-su's reckoning, it simultaneously becomes a stage for cinema's triumph.The thematic exploration of isolation, manipulation, and the cyclical nature of violence adds layers to the film's narrative. Odboy is a testament to the enduring impact of trauma, revealing how the past, once buried, can resurface to exact a devastating toll on the present. It's a cinematic enigma, a psychological thriller that leaves an indelible mark on the psyche. Park Chan-wook's masterful direction, combined with stellar performances, creates an immersive experience that resonates with the complexities of the human condition.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"Go in blind, you'll be glad you did","Chan-wook Park's twisted masterpiece was my first introduction into the world of foreign language films. I couldn't believe how refreshing it felt to watch this unique and original work of pure genius. This film opened a door for me into some incredible productions from around the globe. The downright audacious writing is admirable, throwing the blueprint away and coming up with this amazing revenge story, told in a smart and powerful manner. I reckon that the mountain of revenge films that have come out in the last while owe this film a debt of gratitude. The cinematography, soundtrack and choreography are all something special, as is the acting, notably from Min-sik Choi. His exhaustion from this demanding role actually shows in some scenes. The less known about this film on first viewing, the better.

"Not THAT good, not THAT bad either","I feel people somehow invariably overreact when it comes to this movie. Come on guys, it's just a movie, like it or leave it. It's not necessarily a 10 but neither does it deserve a 1. (For what it's worth, I gave it a 7.) How would I explain this split opinion? It depends very much on what one expects from it, as well as on the overreaction of some viewers who feel, perhaps rightly so, that the movie is way overrated on IMDb, so they feel like they have to overreact the other way, giving it a 1, while this movie is most certainly deserving of much more than 1 !What would be my unadulterated view on the movie itself? It's not as bad as some posters write. At least one should acknowledge some very good camera-work and naturalist honesty in projecting a certain darkness that resides at the bottom of human souls. The main actor does a good job in most of the movie, I think, but the script gives him no chance but to overdo things toward the end, in hysterical tones which can easily grate on the educated movie lover's nerves.On the other hand, I cannot understand for the life of me how such a movie made it so high on the IMDb rating system. It's really unbelievable how that could happen. Some viewers all over the world liked the movie but that still does not explain it. Perhaps the pride of some viewers couched in the same culture made them vote en masse with automatic 10's? Hard to tell.Back to the movie now. I would say that within its own rather cheap genre (""B"" movie), Oldboy is an exceptional production, more attentively scripted, shot and acted than most. There is occasionally some really memorable touch in there, the trace of the hand of a professional (even if you may find the general tone of the movie gross and overboard). On the other hand, compared with most other movies that share comparable ratings, Oldboy seems to be woefully lacking in both substantial and stylistic qualities that would qualify it for such an unlikely honor. There are literally hundreds of 7 to 8 rated movies which are undoubtedly better than this one.If you enjoy this type of ""B"" (from bloody but not only (-:) revenge movie _anyway_ (the ""country relative"" of the ""film noir"" genre), Oldboy will probably not disappoint you. If you expect to watch some kind of unqualified masterpiece, and you have the cinematic culture to understand what that really means, you might (and, I repeat, might) ask for your money back in anger. I have no way of knowing that for sure.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"

Maybe it was just the fact that it knew it had a secret to tell and when it finally told you - you were left saying, ""that's it?!"".Maybe I'm too desensitized to all of this but honestly, if you're going to pay off, pay off big.

Park Chan-Wook's Masterpiece,"At first I used to be have this personal negative sentiment about Korean movie. Korean people tends to make everything over-dramatic (my experience watching FLU which is so painful to watch). And then the sentiment is slightly lowered when I finished this movie.Briefly, this is a story about a man who has been kidnapped and imprisoned for almost 15 years without any explanation. Suddenly he is released only to find note given by the kidnapper which asking him to find the answer who he/she is, why the reason he was imprisoned and get revenge.A journey to find the answer is begin.Right from the opening scene until the very last scene, there are no room for me to breath. The cinematography is so stylish and the acting was top-notch performance. The story development is well-thought and the twist is brilliant, relentless and merciless. The last 15 minutes is my favorite part in this movie. It satisfies my curiousness. By the end credit rolls you will find yourself speechless by how disturbing yet gorgeous the movie was and how the director intentionally leaving us some unanswered questions.My only concern is that I find some of the last part a bit too cliché and sentimental for my taste but it doesn't material.This is Park Chan-Wook's masterpiece and one of the best Korean movie ever made. You will find many elements like gore, thriller, drama, action blends into one perfectly mixed element.And just like any other revenge themed movie, the same question will arise:""When you had your revenge well, what's left for you?""",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"

One of my favorite movies,"This was the movie that got me into Korean cinema. This was in my opinion the best movie from Park-Chan Woo's ""Vengeance Trilogy"" and quite possibly one of the best movies ever made. Around 7 years ago, I have been a huge fan of extreme cinema and I heard about Oldboy from one of my friends. When I actually sat down to watch it, I was completely blown away. This was not like any movie I have ever seen before. The storyline, cinematography, acting and soundtrack have exceeded far beyond my expectations.The story follows a man named Oh Dae-su, who has been held captive in a cell of what seems to be a hotel room for 15 years. After being released, he tries to find his captor, find out his motives, and achieve ultimate vengeance.The storyline seems simple enough, but the movie blows up in the faces of the audience with all kinds of unexpected plot twists. Not only that, but the story involves the audience with the characters in the movie by including very good character development and acting.I could go on and on about this film, but the fact is that it's terrific and worth checking out. It will leave many with lots to talk about after finishing it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
I don't get it.,"Nothing about this film rang true. I've enjoyed a lot of Asian cinema, but perhaps I have just no understanding of the Korean culture. Little that the characters did during the entire film made much sense. There were some wonderful individual scenes and great camera-work, but that didn't make up for a lot of things in the film that appeared for lack of a better word ""lame"". An example is when Oldboy holds off a gang of thugs with a hammer. It didn't work as ""comic book"" action nor as a realistic fight. Another example is the ant thing. Especially the giant ant on the subway. ""Hey, this would look arty"" Really disagree with those that loved this film. It has its merits. I wasn't fooled by the ending twist.

This is a very disturbing film at times and I probably cringed enough for my liking. I'd have to say that its strongest points were the acting and the script. Every character was utterly believable. Especially the main character, Oh Deseau. I have rarely sympathized for a character in a movie as much as I did for him. 15 years? That's ridiculous. As far as the script goes...wow. It's probably one of the best scripts ever written in the history of film. And the ending is just too much.

"Shocking! A must-see, if you have the stomach for it","To be hones I'm in a shock right now.The story of Oldboy is absolutely horrible. And no, I don't mean it's written badly, I mean the story is so horrifying that after I was done I just had to sit and stare the screen for a while. The only thought in my head is: ""What the hell did I just see?"" This is the beauty of movies with clever plot twists that actually do surprise you: Oldboy, Primal Fear, Fight Club... I'm sure there are many more, but just making a list would be lazy. The plot twist in Primal Fear is just surprising. It's clever, but the thing is, it's not that bad. while Oldboy... That plot twist is absolutely shocking. And the story is well written even when you don't count the plot twist. The main character's narration gives a lot more interest to the story. The mystery is intriguing, and the writers have a way of keeping the viewer invested in the story. Even when you don't really like Oh Dae-Su, you still want to know why. And even Oh Dae-Su is not really a likable character, you still wonder if he deserved that. That would be an interesting philosophical debate.There are a few group fight scenes in this film, and they are excellent. They are well coordinated and enjoyable (or as enjoyable as fight scenes are) to watch. The visual side of Oldboy amazes with how good it looks when it needs to. There were few gore-y scenes, yet nothing too horrifying was shown, so something was left to imagination. Still those scenes keep you on the edge of your seat.Oldboy is a very well made movie.

"It's hard. Very hard to watch, but it doesn't make it any less interesting.","How often do you see a movie that makes you think, ""What did I see? I don't know, but it's genius"". That's exactly what you think after watching ""Oldboy"", 2003, directed by Park Chang Wook. Very mixed feelings of disgust and delight overtake the viewer as soon as he reveals the final twist of the plot.In a nutshell, the plot tells the story of an ordinary businessman, Oh Dae-su, who unexpectedly disappears for 15 years. And where he was and who stole him is to be found out over the course of the film.""Oldboy"" comes across exactly as a psychological drama, pushing the feelings and raising reasonable philosophical questions.The main character does not show emotion on his face, but there is so much pain in his eyes, thanks to the acting of Choi Min-sik. The viewer feels sorry for Oh Dae-su and wants to empathize with him, but judging his behavior soberly, it's the opposite. The antagonist Lee Woo Jin played by Yoo Ji Tae also proves to be more than just a faceless villain, the viewer finds out how smart he is and how justified his actions are. So well-reasoned, in fact, that you don't realize whose side you're on.The main problem with the movie is the cast. Other than Oh Dae-su and Lee Woo Jin, the characters are not memorable, seeming faceless. After watching it, it's hard to remember a single minor character who was interesting.The film raises questions about the viewer's personal life stance. What is love? Platonically, relationally, sexually? Is there a difference? What does it mean to get revenge? At what point does revenge end? And what is the difference between a man and an animal?You won't find the answers to these questions in the film, but it will make you think for a long time, the hyperbolized details of the scenes, the close-ups, the cruelty. All of this can be justified by the desire to create an atmosphere of discomfort, because it's the only way you can feel at least a little bit of what Oh Dae-su felt.It's hard. Very hard to watch, but it doesn't make it any less interesting. Separately, I would like to highlight the camerawork. A lot of angles, camera moves, theatrical scenes, and a lot more. All of these visuals serve their purpose. The fight scene in the hallway is considered iconic for a reason. The entire fight is worked out to the smallest detail.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"

This movie is incredible.,"Oldeuboi is currently, and has been for a while now, my favorite movie. Min-sik Choi plays his role flawlessly. This movie promises you an exciting experience right off the bat, and then entirely over-delivers and becomes something much more than you expected going into it.You name it, this movie does it incredibly well. The cinematography is nothing short of artistic. The soundtrack is perfectly fitting and very emotional. The writing and storytelling are the best I've ever seen, and call back to classic tragedies and the tragic hero. I find that American audiences generally don't like this movie much because of it's nontraditional storytelling and ending. If you're interested in something you won't ever get out of an American movie, this will deliver. And don't worry about being bored, because not a second of the runtime of this movie is wasted. There is always either action happening on screen, plot being developed, or cinematography being shown off. Most of the time all at once. Even if you don't like drama, or don't like international movies, it can be appreciated for so many different things that everyone will find something to love about it. The fight scenes in this movie are some of the best I've ever seen, and aren't even one of the main reasons why I love this movie. If you aren't very open to stories that are nontraditional or something you're not used to seeing in the West, you might take issue with this movie, to which I'd say you need to open up some more, because you're missing out on a great experience.As I said earlier, Min-sik Choi is an incredible actor, and after watching Oldeuboi I watched two of his other films, ""I Saw the Devil"" and ""Nameless Gangster: Rules of the Time"", both of which are incredible films that I suggest you go watch if you liked Oldeuboi or are interested in Korean cinema but want something other than Oldeuboi. Min-sik Choi delivers an almost, but not quite as amazing performance in both of those movies. Oldeuboi itself is a great dive into Korean cinema and what it has to offer.

"Park Chan-Wook's Masterful ""Oldboy"" is a Tour-De-Force of storytelling!  My favorite film of all time!","I just recently noticed that I have written 99 reviews on IMDb since joining in 2005. And I have decided, in honor of my 100th review, to tackle my favorite film- a Korean release from 2003, directed by the masterful Park Chan-Wook. I am speaking of course, of the controversial and amazingly elegant film ""Oldboy.""Based loosely upon a Japanese Manga, Chan-Wook's ""Oldboy"" stars the amazing Choi Min-Sik as Oh Dae-Su, a drunk businessman in Korea. The film opens with his abduction from public, as he is mysteriously placed in a dark, dingy building, where criminals pay to have people held captive. Dae-Su is locked in the hotel-like room, being fed daily and only having a TV to keep him company, for 15 years. One day he learns on a news report that his wife was found murdered, and he later learns that his young daughter was sent to adoptive parents out of the country. Over time, he becomes depressed, angry, and eventually empty. He begins to train himself to fight, plotting to escape and seek vengeance. Then, all of the sudden, he awakens one day to find that he has been set free... given money, a suit and a cellphone. A taunting phone call from the one who ordered his captivity ensures that Dae-Su will stop at nothing to get his revenge.He is joined by Mi-Do (Kang Hye-jeong), a beautiful and feisty young chef and his old friend No Joo-hwan (Ji Dae-Han), whom try to assist him as he solves the mysteries surround why he was imprisoned. He also does eventually encounter the man who ordered his capture- a wealthy businessman who lives in a towering skyscraper named Lee Woo-jin (played by Yoo Ji-tae), though the encounter only raises the stakes- Dae-su cannot kill him, for he will kill himself first to rob Dae-su of his revenge if he tries... And now, Dae-su only has five days to solve the mystery, or else Woo-jin will kill Mi-do, whom Dae-su has began to fall for.The acting is superb, especially from our leads Choi Min-sik and Yoo Ji-tae. Both deliver astounding and detailed performances. Choi Min-sik is sympathetic yet at the same time frightening and unstable... you will root for him while fearing him. And Yoo Ji-tae is incredible as our villain, who is oddly likable and charming despite his cruel and often evil nature, much in the same way Hannibal Lector was in ""Silence of the Lambs"", and he plays the role with much joy and delight. Both were chilling.Supporting roles were all well-played. Kang Hye-jeong and Ji Dae-han were both phenomenal, and all other secondary characters were well-played. (Particularly funny is Oh Dal-su as ""Mr. Park"", the nasty little jerk who runs the building where Dae-su was imprisoned. He's the sort of guy who would double-cross his mother for a nickle, and he's a lot of fun to watch.)Park Chan-Wooks direction is what really, truly elevates this film to unknown bounds, though. Chan-Wook has a poetry and a distinctive, sharp visual sense to his camera-work. Everything is perfectly deliberate and perfectly fine-tuned. His choice of colors, textures and patterns also set a marvelous mood. This is one of those films where even if muted, the visual tell the story just as much as the dialog. Everything is perfectly planned out- right down to the wallpaper on the walls and the tiniest prop. (It's even in the making-of.) Chan-Wook's visual sensibility and ability to communicate his ideas with the actors is the closest to perfection as is obtainable. He is truly a master of film.The script is very tight, dare I say, even flawless. It all fits together like an enormous jigsaw puzzle, and each piece is important. The few action sequences are amazing and gritty, the music is perfectly implemented to compliment the story. The many twists and turns the plot takes are breathtaking, and you will leave this film feeling touched and disturbed. It gets under your skin and infects you. You will not forget this movie!This is truly an amazing film. I usually try to find something negative to mention in each of my reviews, but here... I just can't.""Oldboy"" is a 10 out of 10.

What a great head trip,"It was 1988 Seoul and Oh Dae-Su got drunk on his daughter's birthday. After his friend Joo-Hwan got him out of the police station, he is kidnapped off the streets. He is imprisoned in a motel-like cell. He gets gassed periodically without explanation. After 15 years, he is released from a giant suitcase on top of a building. There's a strange guy with a poodle who falls to his death. A bum gives him money and a cellphone. A mysterious man calls to taunt him. He passes out in a sushi restaurant and the cute chef Mi-do takes him home. They both have had hallucinations of ants. His daughter is adopted and living in Stockholm after his wife was murder and he's assumed to be the culprit. He discovers the prison where he was imprisoned. The wealthy Lee Woo-jin reveals himself as his tormentor with a deadly threat against every women that he loves.As I watched this, I kept thinking of David Lynch and to lesser extend Quentin Tarantino. It's got the bloody violent revenge plot at the center of this. What I love more is the weird surreal touches. There's no way that a guy is going to eat a live octopus in any Hollywood movie. It is such a strange plot move to find a place by how a dumpling taste. It takes the cool violent movie to a weird off-kilter place.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"

"Overhyped in my opinion, but still good.","This movie has been on my list for a long time, especially since in certain circles it seems to have reached a bit of a cult status in recent years. And I think because of that my expectations were a bit skewed. First of all, I always heard how shocking it is and I assumed that it was referring to ultraviolent visuals, which is not necessarily the case. And while the script is somewhat original, it also doesn't always make a lot of sense if you think about it a little too long. That being said, it is very well directed, and for the most part, acting is on point (you need to be ok with the typical Asian cinema ""overacting"" at times). Overall not a bad movie, but not the masterpiece I was expecting.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
Don't Be Deceived By The Good Reviews,"I would say that although this film does have its good moments, its not as good as many say it is. First half of the film is pretty intriguing and mysterious. You can't help but wonder what you would do in the situation of a man who has been locked up in a room for unknown to him reasons for fifteen years.The film goes downhill after Oh Dae Su gets out of the prison and starts seeking revenge. The plot has been made way more complicated than it had to be. What I found most annoying is various sentimental scenes where a piano is playing and we supposedly get to see someone's emotions or their ""softer side"" . I did not like it because I thought it took away from the continuity of the movie and its straightforwardness.When I said the plot is too complicated I meant not only that but also that its a very unrealistic plot in which characters do not act the way, I think, people would act in real life. Its just dumb sometimes.There is also a pretty tasteless sex scene that is just painful to look at.I feel like this movie is intentionally glamorized by the director and does not reflect real human emotions. I feel like he was copying Fight Club or similar movies made in the west.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
Absolutely Brilliant!!!,"Let me just say first and foremost, that anyone who cannot stand heavy handed violence, language or sex should probably miss this film... for the rest of us, this film has it all! One of the most incredible performances ever by Choi (the acting all around is spectacular, but he stands out above the rest), great directing, the corridor scene is just pure glee, one of the most ingenious plots and story line twists of all time, and believe it or not, the movie is extremely funny in some parts (the whole, ""now let me tell you my story"" part is hilarious, just to name one example). However what really shows the quality of OldBoy is that it's not just a excellent conglomerate of all those things that make a movie good, it was how it affected you. OldBoy is a extremely deep and psychological movie on the level as well as the carnal level, and it gets better every time you see it. If you think you can handle the content, and don't mind subtitles, then this film is a absolute must see. Overall, this is quite possibly the best revenge drama of all time.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"

Feel Good Movie of 2003,"Sometimes a film leaves you with that warm, fuzzy feeling inside. It's a feeling of fulfillment and completion. A feeling that everything will work out and everyone is okay Oldboy is NOT one of those films.Drunken buffoon Dae-su (Choi) is mysteriously kidnapped and inexplicably held prisoner for fifteen years by men he never sees. He is left only to watch the same television and eat the same dumplings every day. When he is just as inexplicably released back into a world that is now completely alien to him, his only mission becomes finding the man who imprisoned him, by any means necessary.The twists and turns Dae-su's journey takes him down are jaw- droppingly outside the box, leaving the audience only to wonder whether Park is a thematic genius or completely insane nihilist. Based on an equally messed up graphic novel by Nobuaki Minegishi, Oldboy has become one of the best thrillers of all time, capped by one of the best blindsides that has ever been thrown at unsuspecting viewers.Spike Lee attempted an American remake in 2013 starring Josh Brolin, which isn't entirely terrible in and of itself, but it's hard to match the intensity put forward by Park. If you haven't seen this film, don't ruin it by reading into it too much. Just turn the lights down, turn the flick on and begin to feel incredibly uncomfortable by the fact that at any moment someone out there could be plotting to absolutely destroy your life for no reason.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
Perfect,"The movie Old Boy was doing a bit of the rounds on many good movie lists and having a weak spot for Korean movies, I thought of striking it off my to watch list.The movie started with a man being imprisoned for 15 years. It shapes him in an unimaginable way. The portion where he remains imprisoned is a bit slow, but when he gets released, the movie picks up pace and then its a whirlwind of emotions, actions and what not.It definitely has the distinctive ""weird"" charm of South Korean movies which sets it apart from other movies.After watching the movie..the thought that was evoked in me was...what the fish did I just watch?

Vengeance takes on a whole new meaning!,"Old Boy (2003) is by far one of the weirdest and most disturbing films I have seen in quiet a while. I went into this movie knowing very little about the movies plot other than what was printed on the back of the movies Blu-ray cover. I knew Oldboy was a vengeance story that much was obvious but I had no idea just how twisted and insane this movie was going to be.The story follows a ordinary man named Dae-Su (Choi Min-sik) who finds himself the victim of a kidnapping. Dae-Su wakes up and finds himself prisoner inside a private makeshift prison cell with no knowledge of why he was kidnapped or for how long his captors intend on keeping him prisoner for. Dae-Su spends the next fifteen years alone, trapped within the confines of his makeshift prison with his only source of information and entertainment being a Television. Then one day without any rhyme or reason Dae-Su finds himself waking up inside a suitcase in the same place where he was kidnapped fifteen years ago. Now a free man Dae-Su sets out on a mission of vengeance to uncover why he was kidnapped and by who so he can finally exact blood soaked vengeance upon the one responsible for his suffering.Oldboy is an absolutely stunning film that keeps it's audience on the edge of their seat from start to finish with it's cleverly written and well thought out storyline, stunning visuals, and intense fight scenes. I was honestly blown away by this movie's over the top violence and expertly shot action sequences.I highly recommend watching Oldboy it's a one of kind movie that will have you on the edge of your seat from start to finish.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
What happens when adults are not able to properly resolve and deal with conflicts,"Park Chan-wook's ""Oldboy"" (2003) is a harrowing descent into vengeance, obsession and the devastating consequences of unresolved conflicts. Deeply psychological and brutally violent, the film crafts an intricate, almost operatic tragedy where every action stems from an inability to confront and resolve trauma in a meaningful way.At its core, ""Oldboy"" explores how suppressed resentment festers, distorting reality and poisoning lives. Oh Dae-su, the protagonist, is imprisoned for 15 years without explanation, only to be released into a nightmarish scavenger hunt for the truth. His captor, Lee Woo-jin, engineers this elaborate punishment not out of necessity but as a way to cope with his own unresolved guilt and anguish. Instead of processing his grief or confronting the past with clarity, Woo-jin channels his pain into a cruel game of retribution, setting in motion a cycle of suffering that ultimately consumes them both.The film's bleakest revelation is that all of its horrors-psychological manipulation, brutal violence and tragic love-are the result of adults failing to deal with their pasts constructively. Communication is absent, replaced by silence, secrets and revenge. Dae-su himself, despite his transformation into a hardened survivor, remains emotionally stunted, acting on impulse rather than introspection. When the final, devastating truth is revealed, it underscores how deep-seated pain can twist even the most mundane actions into something monstrous.Through its stunning cinematography, visceral fight sequences, and haunting score, ""Oldboy"" does not merely tell a revenge story-it dissects the human condition at its most self-destructive. It suggests that when people fail to address their wounds with maturity and understanding, they risk creating tragedies far worse than the original pain. The film is dark, not just in its subject matter, but in its fundamental belief that justice and catharsis are illusions, and that, for some, escape from suffering may only be found in oblivion.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"

Twisted story but with great acting and prop use,"The trailer is no indication of what you will sit through as the film plays. I was at the same time both deeply disturbed and a little intrigued to see how it would end. Safe to say, I was not at all prepared to spend my Friday night like that. I can't say much without giving away the surprising elements of the film, but if you are considering watching the film, just bear in mind that you will probably be traumatised.I think the reason why I reacted so strongly (and negatively) to this film, is because I have been brought up in a society which considers these topics taboo and cannot even think to imagine if this were to happen to me. So in a way, the film questions the conventions of society and challenges us by putting us outside our comfort zone (way outside).The acting is great as the actors/actresses fully embodied their characters. The interactions between Min-sik, Ji-tae and Hye-jeong went smoothly and is realistic to watch. Min-sik does his character justice as a tortured man with almost nothing left to lose. Ji-tae while still having the looks of an innocent young man delivers the emotions of a sadistic and somewhat mentally unstable character creatively. Hye- jeong too, plays her role as the innocent and oblivious damsel well. However, it seems like a waste to have her introduced as a strong independent woman at the beginning and then turn her into a shallow headed female who is basically useless. Going off that, this film is so obviously male centred, and females are only used for their bodies.The use of props though used mostly for violent acts, are very impactful. A hammer becomes part of Min-sik's signature, replaced teeth turns into a clue, photographs are used to reveal past events and gift boxes no longer connote something positive. The director and writers (based on comic) are quite ingenious in this way, and everything is displayed in a way that ties to the end. Still, I will not be watching this again or the Hollywood remake for that matter.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
A Perfect Revenge Film,"It's very rare to see good revenge based movies since so few exist.

This movie made me think in ways no other movie has managed to do before.The story is also dark and twisted and doesn't shy away from showing everything. Which I think is amazing, it's so bold and unapologetic and it really helps the story develop properly.The director and writer wanted to tell a story, and they wouldn't stop at anything to tell it.

The world laughs with you,"A classic Korean revenge film developed by the mastermind Chan-wook Park couldn't be any better then what it has become. The movie itself has attributed a rather love it or hate it personality during its introduction to the American public and its rather explicit and disturbing scene for sex. I entirely understand its concept and brutality; it is after all a great homage to film-noir and attempts to break every boundary to become one of the darkest films ever created without being a actual horror.During the 15 year imprisonment scene the character had lost all possible nature of himself as he had been forced to become a animal. Masterbating to dancing women. Writing in his journal on whom would have put him through all this pain. Training in combat by punching the wall. Slowly cutting through the brick to at least just feel the breeze of the outside and the rain trickle over his hand and even attempting to smash his head against glass in attempt to kill himself.All that was once the character had been lost in a spiral of insanity in his solitary confinement. Upon release his character had to regain the ability to live in society. He had to learn new words, he had to learn to laugh, to love, to feel guilt and sorrow and to cry. All this character development to a beautiful soundtrack mixed with classical and techno themes.Only flaw in this movie would have to be the one scene when Oh Dae-su takes the roll of super-man and cleanses the underground of all the scum. That wasn't enough to interrupt the brilliance of the movie. The time he was lying on the ground with a grin on his face before he put the cigarette in his mouth or the time hes walking away laughing after the man has fallen from the roof onto a car.In end this movie will not make you laugh. No it will make you cry on behalf of how we lost the film industry to Korea. Because remember when you laugh, the world laughs with you but when you cry, you cry alone.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
Oldeuboi: Entirely Exquisite,"The second of Chan-wook Park's ""Vengeance Trilogy"", Oldeuboi appears to be the most revered and respected of the thematic triplets. Having absolutely loved the first, Boksuneun naui Geot, I was highly sceptical that this could possibly do any better.Having been imprisoned inexplicably for fifteen years, Dae-su Oh finds himself released just as suddenly and mysteriously. Knowing nothing about where or why he was kept, he sets out on a quest for revenge, meeting along the way a sushi chef with whom he begins to fall in love.One of the opening scenes, in which Dae-su stumbles drunkenly about a police station, provides us with nice humour: partly a way to lull us into a false sense of security; partly a way to make the darkness which follows tolerable. Like its predecessor, Oldeuboi is incredibly dark and gritty, both its themes and imagery constantly exploring the very depths of depravity and despair. The scenes of imprisonment are strange: while Dae-su's cage is neither bare nor uncomfortable, he himself becomes increasingly so, the scenes of graduating delusion and hallucinating building to an inevitable crescendo of tragedy. It is difficult to watch him spiral downwards, not least of all when he learns that he has been framed for the murder of his wife. Min-sik Choi's performance incorporates a flurry of perfectly timed and pitched emotions, cementing an incredibly real character within our minds and allowing him to evolve whilst all the while remembering his thirst for vengeance and the effect of his incarceration. Hye-jeong Kang grounds the film with a meek humility, her unassuming sushi chef the only element of sanity in Dae-su's insane world. The narrative effectively keeps us guessing, the final turns in plot unforeseen and quite striking, adding to the facets a consistently excellent story, and one which invites thought in a genuine manner. Worth noting is the corridor sequence relatively early in the film, a superb technical achievement and one of the film's crowning glories. A true spectacle which presents action in a unique way, bringing a brilliance to what might have been a mundane scene.An entirely exquisite follow-up to the first of the trilogy, Oldeuboi succeeds under the magnificence of Park's direction. Ensuring the further remarkableness of this astounding offering, it leaves all demanding to see part three. For me, it falls just short of the level of excellence achieved by its forebear. An amazing film in any case, it is yet another example of the prowess of South Korean cinema.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
Interesting Premise That Ultimately Fails,"I think the best word to sum up how I felt after watching Oldboy was ""frustrated."" The premise underlying the film is an interesting take-off of The Count of Monte Cristo and it certainly promises a lot of potential. And the director certainly cannot be accused of taking obvious directions to appease the masses. I certainly paid close attention to Oldboy and, admittedly, watched it a second time. But in all honesty, I did not enjoy it and I can say wholeheartedly that this must be one of the most overrated films on IMDb.Like many of Oldboy's harshest critics, my major problem with the film was the big ""twist"" - - the reason Dae Su was imprisoned. This twist was completely preposterous. Even in the realm of fantasy/action films, I just could not swallow it. It felt like the kind of cheap twist you would find in a B slasher movie like Prom Night. Unlike films like Sixth Sense, where you can re-watch and see connections that lead to the surprise twist, you can't do that with Oldboy. Further, the twist does not fit with the overall mood of the film. Oldboy strives for a real and grim atmosphere but the major villain's plan fits better with a James Bond film.Oldboy has other problems. Its action set-pieces are not particularly impressive and are few and far between. There is no action scene that will stick out in your mind, like Hard-boiled or The Killer. Yes, there are some seat-squirming graphic revenge scenes, but even they are not as ""extreme"" as advertised.Ultimately, Oldboy's success hinges on the suspense and impact of its major plot twist and, given its implausibility, the film falters and falls on its face. I have seen that this film has been scheduled for a re-make and, despite generally disliking remakes, I think Oldboy is an excellent candidate. Somewhere in this muddled mess is a great idea that, with the right script, could make an excellent movie.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"

Great Korean revenge thriller,"Awesome movie with great cinematography, plot, characters and twists, but I'd say it's not for everyone, beacuse it's pretty dark and has a lot of rough scenes, e.g. A squid which is eaten alive.I recently read the manga by Garon Tsuchiya and Nobuaki Minegishi and I think, that Park Chan-Wook did a great job out of this mediocre source. The manga is like a 6/10, because the pacing was very slow, the fight scenes weren't as good as in the movie, and the final plot ""twist"" was boring. I liked, that the dialogues were better, it filled a few little plottholes and clarified a few things of the movie, which were kinda complicated.I recommend reading the manga before watching the movie, but if you only watch the movie you won't miss anything.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"

Ants In Pants,"Visually stunning and stylishly executed, Chan-wook Park's 'Oldboy' is loosely based on 'Oedipus' and 'The Count of Monte Cristo'. On the technical front, it gets almost everything right. The background score is marvelous. The action sequences are well shot even though poorly choreographed. The cinematography and visuals are stunning. The CGI is fake at times (for example the ant crawling under the skin scene). The dialogues are wannabe symbolic and wannabe philosophical. The acting is over-the-top. I didn't see any point in the movie as a whole. Nor did 'Oldboy' entertain me neither did it enlighten. I fail to understand what puts this film on a World Cinema level and what is it that so many love about this movie? Was it the shock value with all the gruesome and gory scenes? It starts on an interesting note but then one finds out that it's a silly contrived revenge plot (not to mention the numerous plot holes). What was Park trying to imply? That it's okay for the brother to have sex with his sister and that Dae-Su's telling someone about it in confidence was the bigger crime? Or is it that the best revenge would be to make him have sex with his own daughter? Don't even get me started on the whole hypnosis-erasing-your-memory crap. In my humble opinion, 'Oldboy' is quite a stupid pretentious movie. It's executed quite well but has no substance. A waste of my time.",,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"

Savage Plot Saved by Imagery and Sound,"""Oldboy"" is best viewed on a clean slate. I knew nothing about it before watching it, only that a friend recommend it.

As such, I will probably avoid watching it again, as it was oddly endearing and I would rather remember it well than think about it too much and ruin the experience.A simplistic and twisted revenge plot gets shrouded in claustrophobic mystery and visual chutzpah (the camera work and color scheming are intense and satisfying, a stunning blend of Scorsese and Zhang Zimou) that tricks the unsuspecting viewer into thinking they are watching something more special than it really is. There's also a fantastic music score blending classical pieces with techno music. The music and the imagery last in the viewer's mind long after the film ends. Unfortunately the story line and characters do not. I suppose on a simple motion picture level (where one views film-making as a purely visual and sound art form) the film is a rousing success. However, if you wish to view film as a story telling art form, this repetitive and contrived motion picture fails miserably. Already pegged for a Hollywood remake that will no doubt pummel the style over substance nature of the film into the ground.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
Absolute masterpiece with a deranged twist,"I wrote this review because I saw a lot of people giving low scores. Many of those gave ""the twisted"" plot as the main reason for their low scores. They state that they ""were in shock"" after the ""sick plot"" was revealed. Now, isn't that the purpose of good cinema ? Having an overwhelming experience as a viewer and being blown away by a crazy scenario ? Nobody asked you to agree with what happens in the movie, nor did the director ask you such a thing. So many of the reviewers that gave very low scores because they were shocked by this movie, actually compliment the director and all the other people that worked on this movie. Crazy masterpiece !",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
Superb and original,"A friend recommended this and I wasn't sure it was my kind of thing, especially when I tend to lose track with subtitles, but I found this not to be a problem here. It is certainly a movie that you have to be alert to watch and keep up with what is going on. I'm not going to talk about the plot other than to say it is a roller coaster of emotions , twists and turns and keeps you interested throughout- it is unique. The direction makes you feel you are right there in what is happening, one of those movies where you really don't want to pause it or miss a single second. . Min-sik Choi, as the main character -Oh Dae-Su is incredibly good, his transformations throughout are worthy of any acting award going... I loved this film. I did some searches after watching it, to find out about Min-sik Choi and what else he had done..there is an article about some of the things that were not acting but really happened during this movie..check it out ..it's bizarre!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"

A Masterpiece,"First of all, I want to clarify that I'd personally give Oldboy a score of 9.2 or so but given the nature of IMDb's rating system if you like a movie you gotta give it a 10 Where to begin? From the amazing score by Jo Yeong-wook to the compelling and skillful acting of Choi Min-sik, Oldboy is, all the way through, a masterpiece. Few movies manage to be so gripping and at the same time so emotional. Oldboy tells the story of Oh Dae-su, a middle-aged drunkard who, after one of his many late-night drunken endeavors, mysteriously disappears off the face of the earth, leaving his wife and daughter. Turns out Oh Daeu-su is actually imprisoned in what seems to be a hotel room and he has to spend the next 15 years of his life there with no other human connection. After he is finally released, Oh Dae-su, now a shell of his former self, embarks on a quest to find the man responsible for his mysterious imprisonment and his reasons behind it.Oldboy is a great journey through human psyche and you will find yourself thinking about it way after you've watched it. A must-watch for anyone who enjoys good cinema.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
This time vengeance has moulded itself to be a double-edged sword,"""Laugh and the world laughs with you. Weep, and you weep alone.""It's completely different as compared to the other traditional tales of retaliation. Simply cause this time vengeance has moulded itself to be a double-edged sword. Above all, it's an eloquent (whiffs of Kafkaesque Nightmare) delineation about how one man's single misstep could lead to disastrous consequences. Besides, there's also a tangible psychological/philosophical aspect, that would give birth to an unbidden conundrum in your mind.Oldboy is impulsively raw, unashamedly tenacious and this same murkier posture helps it to attain the right kind of vibe and atmosphere the story craved for. Further complemented through and through by its technical prowess, that is only matched by an extraordinary enactment coming directly from the main guy i.e. Choi Min-Sik. He took precedence over everything and everyone else, period. Suffice it to say, his performance alone has elevated this film to greater heights!",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
Disturbingly dark,"I recently saw another Korean film 'I Saw the Devil' and, in light of the fact that I've now watched a film made by the same people, 'Oldboy' I'm glad I did. Because I think that many of us have been kind of lulled into believing that the only way to make a film is 'the Hollywood way.' I didn't like 'I Saw the Devil' when I started watching it, but, after persevering, I was glad I did in the end. Plus, now I feel I know Korean cinema a little better (or how it's done) I was able to enjoy (if that's the right word) 'Oldboy' from the off.And it's certainly a difficult film to describe, let alone say who's its target audience is. A man – and not a particularly nice one – doesn't bother seeing his estranged wife and baby daughter in favour of generally going out and getting drunk. However, things quickly catch up with him when he's swiped off the streets and locked in a room for no less than fifteen years without explanation. However, during this time he's had more than a few changes of heart. Now he's not only ready to find out and punish whoever imprisoned him in the first place, but also make amends with his daughter, who is now basically grown up in his absence.It would be easy to label Oldboy as a 'revenge thriller.' Yes, there are certainly aspects of hunting down those who wronged him. But it's the way it's done that makes it so different. I would go into specifics, but it's one of those films where if you say too much about the plot you will give away vital points which will lead to you predicting what's to come. It's fair to say that there are more than a few twists and turns to keep you interested (or disgusted?) and you will not only need to be ready for those, but also have a strong stomach in terms of content material.Which brings me back to my thoughts on who it's marketed at. I don't really know – people who like revenge movies, but can tolerate some pretty disturbing story lines mainly. Oh, and subtitles. It's got subtitles – but then you probably guessed that. However, even though you have to read the dialogue it's still easy to tell that the cast are pretty impressive and there are performances that are going to stick with you – even if some of them are for the wrong reasons.Basically, if you like your foreign revenge films dark then give this one a go. Just don't blame me for any therapy you may require after sitting through it. A classic, but a dark one.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
Revenge,"I have known about this movie for quite a while
But for one reason or another
I never got around to watching it until recently
This is a sick twisted tale of revenge
It's not a perfect movie
(In my opinion anyway) The story moves to fast and feels all over the place
When I think of revenge movies
I think of slower pacing and more details on why the person is seeking revenge
I actually had to watch one of those ending explained videos
Before I understood it
To me the fact I had to go to a ending explained video indicates it's not a perfect movie But now that I get it I'd say it's a good movie and the ending suits the story But it's nowhere near a great or perfect movie.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"

A reason to have faith in Art-house films,"Oldboy was a fantastic film which had an unexpected ending. It's one of those films where you purely and genuinely feel sorry for the main characters. The execution of the film as whole was genius and very well done.Character development was really well done and it wasn't hard to follow the storyline at any point of the film.

brilliant brilliant brilliant,"I'll echo the majority of the viewers' sentiments, this film is brilliant.I really did not know what to expect when I first sat down to watch it, except that I'd hoped it would be a good thriller from a well respected Korean director.And that's how you should approach this film if you haven't watched it, expect nothing, because that's when you get the most out of it. I've read a couple of reviews regarding the ""incomprehensible"" plot and ""rambling storyline"" and it beggars belief how these people have come to this conclusion.In terms of plot and storyline, it's one of the most original and tightly controlled I've ever watched. From the start, when a man is put in a private jail without explanation for 15 years, you're drawn into the story. Then it just gets better.Acting by the two central characters, the antagonist and the protagonist - at times they easily swap places, such is the clever story line and the brilliant acting - is outstanding. The energy and the inner rage with which both go about the roles was just brilliant to watch.The music score was pretty much perfect for any film I've come across and the main melody is as memorable as any you're likely to come across in any medium.The twists are not over-egged, as they don't need to be, and the gut-wrenching, brutal yet emotionally charged penultimate scene will stay with you for a long time afterwards. This film is in my top 10 of all time. Just watch it with an open mind. It's a great, great film.",,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
This movie freaked me out!,"Dae-su, a man who has been held captive for no apparent reason for 15 years, is suddenly released with all the things he would need to find the one who did this to him.This is easily the best revenge thriller I have ever seen. From its confusing start to its sick and ambiguous ending, this movie is a head-to-toe masterpiece. It keeps us hooked perfectly throughout the entire movie. A mind-blowing thriller with a touch of cat-and-mouse chasing throughout the movie.This movie is an original screenplay wonder that takes inspiration from the Greek play Oedipus Rex, written by Sophocles, and adapts it to the modern Korean backdrop. A perfect blend of revenge, suspense, trauma, tragedy and unclear ending makes it one of the greatest movies ever made in the World Cinema. Everything regarding this movie is peak perfection but, I think the most thing that makes this movie stand out is its masterful screenplay.Park Chan Sook, the man who directed this masterpiece, deserves all the praise and respect. He perfectly showed us this movie's dark and twisted world and made us indulge ourselves completely in it. The way he captured all the characters especially Dae Su and Woo Jin, that long action scene taken in a single cut, the excellent depiction of gore and violence, and leaving the ending in our thoughts, truly make him a brilliant director. I have seen some of his other movies as well but, this one is just PERFECT!All the actors did a wonderful job and they deserve their credit but Choi Min-Sink shook me to the core. His performance was something else. The character of Dae Su was already very complex but, Choi Min-Sink's top notch and real performance made us forget that he was acting. He became the Dae Su himself. His freaky yet painful laughing, the anger and rage he expressed through his eyes, the action and fights he performed and the climax where he totally stunned us with his acting, makes him truly stand out as one of the greatest Korean actors ever.As mentioned earlier, the movie is a head-to-toe perfection but, the thing that makes it a timeless classic and a cinematic milestone is its traumatizing and painful ending. It is so haunting and traumatizing that this movie stays in your mind for a long time. A revelation that turned our minds and hearts upside down. That moment was truly horrifying and unexpected. Also, a touch of ambiguity is added to the final scene, just before the last cut which keeps us wondering whether Dae Su has set free from all the pain or he has to live with that unspeakable pain till his death. That scene still freaks me out.To conclude my review, I want to say that this movie is a must-watch for all the cinephiles and those viewers who can withstand violence and disturbing themes because this movie can seriously mess your head up and you won't be able to wipe it out of your mind.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"Revenge Served Cold, But Not Quite Unexpected","This movie is about Dae-su Oh, held as a prisoner for 15 years and gets released to find his captor. The movie covers the pursuit of Dae-su, the reason for being in prison for 15 years, and disturbing revenge by the villain.The story had a good start, as the plot was interesting for the first 40 minutes. The scenes were written in a raw and dark sense to create a hard-hitting movie. The first fighting scene was good, but at last, it was lame. The characters were written well to create a mysterious feel to the story. The villain's motive was not good enough to take revenge on Dae-su, but after all, being delusional is the villain's trait, too.I slept in between and woke up in a flashback scene; I didn't rewind the movie but continued watching, and still, I understood what was going on. Still, I am not curious to look back on what I missed while I slept. The last and final hard-hitting twist, unfortunately, I saw that coming, and they hinted it already with her things in the bag.The actors were good at their roles. The cinematography and composition were good and set the right mood for the story. The music was not memorable at all.In conclusion, it was a was a decent revenge story for me.

But he was kidnapped before he can walk any further, and he was kept in a secure special prison for 15 years.In those 15 long years, he entertained himself in watching TV, writing a journal, and training himself in fighting. He was served dumplings every time, and most often he doesn't eat the food being served to him. Little by little, he digs a hole in the wall covered by his bedside. He just use a chopstick to do it, and he planned to get outside on the 15th year of his stay...When he gets out, his first mission was to find his capturer. and the tragedy just keeps getting better from there.After I watched the film, I made a donation to the website where I watched it.

The kind of movie that won't grow old.,"An alcoholic father and husband is captured and kept in captivity during 15 years without knowing why. When he gets out, he's hell-bent on revenge and discovering why he was imprisoned. This is a powerful movie with strong dramatic performances. It's intense and constantly keeps you on your toes. The story is amazing and full of twists and turns until the very end. Speaking of twists, the film is a bit twisted in itself by the themes it portrays. It does make us question what is moral and acceptable in revenge. The directing is bold and inventive.There's a long fight scene without cuts in a corridor that's practically an anthology piece. Other memorable moments involve teeth and a tongue. Notice how the director often plays with our expectations showing relatively little but creeping us out nevertheless. The story also plays with our perceptions of the characters, making them more or less sympathetic. The main character has quite the character arc transformation, completely changing physically and psychologically during the course while keeping the viewer on edge because he's a bit unstable... So, it's overall quite fascinating, intellectually stimulating, viscerally gripping, and heartily recommended provided you don't expect a simple, typical revenge movie and you keep an open mind.Rating: 8.5 out 10 (remarkable)",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"

A Dark and Distinctive Thriller That Leaves an Unsettling Impression,"""Oldboy"" stands as a cinematic enigma, offering a plot that is undeniably different and capable of keeping audiences hooked from the beginning. However, beneath the surface of its unique narrative lies a film that can be described as nothing short of disturbing.The storyline takes unexpected turns, creating a gripping atmosphere of mystery and suspense. The unconventional plot is a departure from conventional narratives, and its ability to keep viewers intrigued is commendable. The film delves into the psyche of its characters, presenting a dark and haunting exploration of human nature.However, the overall impact of ""Oldboy"" can be overshadowed by its disturbing elements. The film doesn't shy away from visceral and unsettling scenes, leaving a lasting impression that extends beyond the screen. The visceral nature of the narrative may prove to be a divisive factor, with some viewers finding it difficult to reconcile with the film's darker aspects.While the movie is undoubtedly a unique piece of cinema, its disturbing content can overshadow its storytelling brilliance for some audiences. It's a challenging watch that elicits a range of emotions, from fascination to discomfort.In conclusion, ""Oldboy"" is a film that demands attention for its distinctiveness and ability to keep viewers engaged with its unusual plot. However, the overall experience is marked by a sense of discomfort and unease, making it a movie that may not be suitable for everyone.

One-Of-A-Kind Revenge Tale!,"Amélie's quirkiness, Tarantino's violence and gore, interesting characters, intriguing plot, profound philosophical questions, and insanely cool action sequences made this gut-wrenching revenge tale the most gripping, entertaining, and enthralling movie of its kind, except it's actually one of a kind!Amid the gruesome scenes, and the brutal fight sequences, Oldboy has a very emotionally devastating story. Chan-wook Park could have easily leaned on nothing but the action and the gore to grab the viewers' attention from the beginning. Instead, he knew that if there is anything that can attract the attention of the audience, and make them invested in the protagonist as fast as possible, it would be a thoughtful moral philosophy mingled with a sentimental story. That's how Chan-wook Park captivated the viewers from the opening scene until he evoked a catharsis in the audience at the traumatic third act.Flawless is a very weak, and unsatisfying word to describe the third act. It's simply look like nothing you've seen before, or even you'll see. With its twist reveal, to the outrageous and shocking visceral images, the third act is provocative, distressful, and utterly maddening. But nothing would have worked in it, and in the entire movie as a whole without Min-sik Choi's kinetic multi-layered performance.The fact that this movie didn't get a single Oscar nod, at least for Min-sik Choi's incredible performance, is as infuriating as the movie itself. For me, Min-sik Choi delivered one of the best performances in the past decade. Yes, I would easily put his performance alongside Adrien Brody's in The Pianist, Leonardo DiCaprio in The Aviator, Daniel Day-Lewis in There Will Be Blood, and Heath Ledger in The Dark Knight. But all that thanks to Chan-wook Park who allowed Min-sik Choi to show all his talent challenging him, and his pathetic, Dae-su Oh.What is truly impressive is how Chan-wook Park put us in Dae-su Oh's shoes by changing the tone, so gracefully, to resemble how the protagonist feels. The movie starts off with flashes of dark humor matching how mazed and lost the character feels. Then, when things become more clearer and clearer the tone becomes darker and darker till the climax when the movie became acutely distressing and dreary.Nevertheless, these tonal changes didn't work very well at the second act. Not because the tonal shift wasn't smooth, nor it came abruptly, but because that was the time when our protagonist, as well as us, discovering clues, and collecting pieces to get the whole picture. The whole act was very convoluted, for better or worse, but the thing is that the pacing was madly rushed resembling Dae-su Oh's confusion and ignorance. Not to mention, there were some sequences where we get to know about some very important characters, and some specifics related to them. Adding insult to injury, some of these details could be passed up, because they are simply not that important. The result is that the movie almost lost me a couple of times. I mean that I really lose track of some small details.Oldeuboi is a very powerful, thought-provoking, and visceral film, and that's because what it implies more than what it depicts.

You may want to feel 'living things' or 'something fresh',to feel what the life means by eating which is the basic humaninstinct, if you are prisoned 15 years and eat just one itemfried dumping for 15 years. How about canned Ravioli for 15 years or Big Mac for 15 years? Or French Fried for 15 years?For me, Oldboy to Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance is what Koryo Blue Porcelain to Chosen White Porcelain. Each film has its own attraction but OldBoy is much more decorative than Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance which shows the beauty and power of the simplicity.I still prefer the latter, though Oldboy is still great.",,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
Highly Wacky,"Outlandish, bizarre and downright disturbing at times are the best words I can use to describe this Korean action drama. It's about a man held in captivity for 15 years for some odd reason and once he's let out he is out for revenge but man does it take some length to get there through some very disturbingly confusing and downright awkward scenes. I think the biggest problem with this movie is that it wastes a lot of the audience's time with filler scenes, but then expects it to all be paid off by the wild twist of an ending that is supposed to make up for the rest of the film, but to me just feels kind of too little too late. Especially the context behind the twist really makes it all the more worse. Yes it's shock and awe inspired twist, but at the same time that doesn't excuse it for what it is on paper which is a vastly degrading thing to have committed even if it was something beyond your control and having to live with doing such an act or dying just makes it more cringe worthy. But I do respect the film for doing what it did, even though I didn't enjoy what the outcome was for the most part. It does have some big fat hairy balls for doing what I did though. And I can't fault it for that. But I can't fault it for is the bloated two hour run time when this probably could've been wrapped up in a little over 90 minutes. Lastly, what I did enjoy most of all was this one hallway fight scene that was very reminiscent of the Daredevil series hallway fight scene mixed in with a little bit of a Yakuza video game fight feel. Overall, Oldboy is an odd duck but a duck that has some interesting moments a couple of entertaining ones and a heck of a lot of wickedly disturbing and cringe ones. If you're all about the cringe though this will be right up your alley. But if you're like me and you only dabble in cringe, then I would spend my time watching something a little less funky.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
oldboy,I will admit it i didnt saw many foreign films cause usually im not big fan of them their world doesnt interest me but oldboy has something that gravited me towards it through acting to fight choreography oldboy deliverse it and it shows why korean films are usually top notch and for me the best foreign film i saw but that could change in future even if it will be hard to top it,9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
An acquired taste,"I saw this for the first time the same week I watched Battle Royale. With the other movie, it's very high concept and very violent, but I much preferred it.The issue with oldboy is there is an intriguing mystery in the middle of all of this. Why has he been locked up for 15 years? It's a great conceit, but the payoff, personally for me, doesn't work.The films violence is so heightened it shares more in common with Battle Royale than it does with a great drama. And yet despite the ridiculousness of the central character and the overall plot, nobody is having any fun. Everybody is very serious and the climax for me was overblown melodrama which I didn't believe at all.The direction is incredible, the very famous scenes are quite rightly highly regarded. But it's quite a long movie for quite a slight idea which you either go with or don't. This movie clearly isn't for everyone it didn't work for me - you have been warned.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
Overrated,"I went to see this movie because it had a 8.6 rating at IMDb.com. How can people overrate it like that?The first 90 minutes were sooo boring. The whole movie, you wait for something to happen which explains everything. And when that happens in the end, it's just a disappointment. The story is unrealistic, the dialogues are poor (and no they are NOT intellectual, for all wannabe-intellectuals - not only since the few wise sentences have to be repeated five times for everybody to remember them). The few messages could've been brought to the viewer in a much more entertaining way.Like in David Lynch movies, Oldboy forces you to think about it, and think about it, try to find a deeper sense, and while you are watching you realize that there is none - and that's just poor.",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"

All this movies are great, and probably are the best work from Mr. Park, but OldBoy is a true Master Piece.

The OG Korean Thriller...!,My Rating : 9/10'Oldboy' is the quintessential Korean thriller. Enough has been said about it so no point in me going into the details.

"A Symphony of Revenge: ""Oldboy""","""Oldboy,"" directed by Park Chan-wook, is an extraordinary South Korean thriller that leaves viewers both enthralled and disturbed.The plot centers on Oh Dae-su, a seemingly ordinary man played brilliantly by Choi Min-sik, who is inexplicably imprisoned in a small, windowless room for 15 years. As he is released without explanation, he embarks on a relentless quest to uncover the identity of his captor and the motivations behind his haunting imprisonment. As Dae-su's journey unfolds, it transforms from mere revenge into a dark exploration of the human condition, identity, and the consequences of one's actions.One of the most striking aspects of ""Oldboy"" is its intricate narrative structure. Park Chan-wook crafts a suspenseful tale filled with unexpected twists and moral complexities that challenge traditional notions of justice. The film's pacing is gripping, keeping viewers on the edge of their seats as secrets unravel and the stakes rise. The film culminates in a shocking climax that forces audiences to reflect on the nature of revenge and its unbearable costs.Choi Min-sik's performance is nothing short of exceptional. He embodies the anguish and rage of Dae-su with a raw intensity that remains unforgettable. His transformation from a passive victim to an agent of vengeance is both compelling and haunting. Supporting performances by Yoo Ji-tae, who plays the enigmatic antagonist, and Kang Hye-jeong, who portrays a pivotal character in Dae-su's journey, add further depth to the film's emotional landscape.Visually, ""Oldboy"" is a feast for the senses. Park's direction is complemented by captivating cinematography that captures both the bleakness of Dae-su's imprisonment and the vibrant yet dark world outside. The film is peppered with striking imagery, including the iconic hallway fight scene shot in a single continuous take-an exhilarating blend of choreography and cinematographic expertise. Furthermore, the haunting score by composer Jeong Jong-hyeon perfectly complements the film's tone, amplifying the viewer's emotional experience.However, it's essential to note that ""Oldboy"" does not shy away from graphic violence and disturbing themes, which may be unsettling for some viewers. Yet those willing to confront its darker elements will find a rich tapestry of storytelling that transcends typical genre conventions.Oldboy"" is not without its controversies, as it delves into graphic violence and disturbing themes that may not be suitable for all viewers. However, those who appreciate bold storytelling and complex character arcs will find it to be a remarkable and thought-provoking film.In conclusion, ""Oldboy"" is a cinematic masterpiece that challenges and captivates its audience. With its blend of psychological depth, stunning visuals, and a haunting narrative, it remains a cornerstone of modern cinema and a vital part of the conversation around the portrayal of revenge on screen. Park Chan-wook's film is not merely a movie; it is an experience that lingers long after the credits roll.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
This movie....,"Don't get me wrong. I thought this movie was awesome. The fight scenes were hilarious and Dae-Su's not so desirable appearance made him all the more likable. I only wish that movies made in this country could live up to foreign or even independent films. But alas, that's not how it is. One of the few good things about living in NYC is being able to know and see more things that you wouldn't otherwise see in Smalltownsville, USA.I only wrote all that so my main point can be posted (10 line minimum).The most f*cked up thing for me about this movie was how I felt in the end after getting all worked up about the sex scene in the beginning. I literally wanted to vomit.Thats all.save the whales.-karen",,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
Pay my theraphy bills,"The plot twist screwed my mental health pretty well for sure, but it was not like i did not saw it coming. The makers does a good job of hiding the final curtain reveal at the end but if you know anything about drama thrillers you will see it coming maybe not to the weird extent which it actually goes to. Also I feel that the most pop-culture fame oldboy gets is mostly for its absurdity. The scene perspectives & cinematography were really creative but it lacked on story. Using hypnosis so casually on normal people for taking years long revenue just feels very convenient plot device to fill gap.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
Much better than sympathy for mr vengeance,"Rated R for strong violence including scenes of torture, sexuality and pervasive language.After a year of pestering from a friend, I finally watched Oldboy.Oldboy is the second film in the Chan Woo Park Vengeance trilogy.The first film in the series is Sympathy For Mr Vengeance and the third film is Sympathy For Lady Vengeance.The films are all in one trilogy but have nothing to really do with each other, besides the fact that the films are all about revenge.I did not see lady vengeance but I didn't really care for mr vengeance that much.I found it to be a bit boring.It was an alright film though.Oldboy is much much better.The film is much more interesting, thought-provoking and entertaining than the first film.A man mysteriously gets locked up for 15 years.When he is released, he seeks vengeance on the man who locked him up.There are many plot twists in the film and you will find yourself on the edge of your seat when you watch it.Even if you didn't like Mr.Vengeance, Oldboy is worth a look!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
Dark entertainment,"Absolutely brilliant in its first few scenes (and a damn good first hour), which set the tone for a wild ride and showcase director Park Chan-wook's impressive visual flair. The mystery of what's happening to this guy is intriguing, and as he himself tries to figure out, we get a very creative fight scene in the corridor (among lots of other things, cough, octopus). It's no wonder Tarantino liked this film so much, as its main theme is revenge, it goes for those big, squirm-inducing shock moments, and it's quite stylish. For me it fizzled a bit in the second half, as I saw more of the nemesis character and the story was revealed. Much as I tried to suspend disbelief (and not think too much about the misogyny), several big moments in the plot seemed contrived, and it seemed kind of messy, wanting focus. Still entertaining though, if you're in the mood for something dark.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
Repugnant and meaningless,"After having suffered through the major part of this film, I finally stood up and walked out of the theater. And mark my words, that's the first time I did that. With that not said that it's the worst film I've ever seen at the cinemas, but first there are the regular bad films and then there are the films that really overwhelm you in their surprising amount of empty meaninglessness. I was apparently misled by the great praise this movie has been given here in Sweden by reviewers that I normally trust, not to mention the award in Cannes.The film does not work at any level, with a possible exception for the settings and the suggestive coloring. All I could see was a repugnant protagonist that stumbles from one out-of-place and pointless scene to another, maybe he was out to have his revenge on somebody, or maybe was he just adding to the confused and weak script with his own confusing actions, it does'nt really matter since the film did'nt really communicate anything substantial at all.",3.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"

I am sure some people will have some bad things to say about this, but I think it is a great piece of work, and it is thoughrouly enjoyable.It kept me glued from beginning to end, and for 30 minutes after as I had to just sit and go over the film again in my head.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"For your own sake, Ignore all of the ""This movie sucked"" comments","First off, the plot, one of the things I noticed was a common theme in the comments criticizing ""Oldboy"" was actually quite impressive. There is a twist like in all good movies. If you were one of the folks who saw it coming a mile away, good for you, congratulations. Now you can sit back and enjoy the ride. Oldboy is one of those films that starts out strong, builds you up the whole way through, and then ends with a bang, leaving you satisfied and thinking back at what a great film it was. It follows a lonely man who has many problems but refuses to face them. The movie guides him through a healing path where he discovers the mistakes he made in his life and as a result pays the consequences for them. It really makes the viewer draw many parallels between his or her life and the life of our tragic hero in the film. Not to mention it is beautifully filmed. The choreography in a rather impressive sequence involving some torture and a fight scene involving a hammer (I won't say much more for sake of avoiding spoilers) was fabulous, almost a bit Matrix-esquire. See this movie! It's worth it!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
Octopus Sushimi - Tasty Snack or Foul Meal ?,"Old Boy is a slick action thriller that is both entertaining and ultimately thought provoking. Fincher's 'Fight Club' and Miike's 'Ichi The Killer' have both been raised as stylistic comparisons and there is a lot of merit to this perspective.Essentially, it is about a man's imprisonment and subsequent quest for vengeance against his initially unknown captor. To state more than that would be to spoil a film that relies upon a significant plot-twist. This plot twist has been much discussed. Further, there appears to be a significant amount of ambiguity in the final scene that leaves it open to interpretation as to whether the protagonist has 'taken steps' to move on from the events, or whether he is still a warped monster of revenge.It is safe to say that it is a niche film - one for people who like overt cinematic technique - namely flashy visuals and inventive action sequences. My personal bias is towards such films that take an innovative approach to visuals and for this reason, and the provocative ending, I found it to be a very good film.I think that most people would find it entertaining to some degree. Whether they would find it a good film is a matter of debate. There have been a great many reviews extolling the merits of the film and many eloquent criticisms - both are equally valid.There are continuity lapses and some facile quasi deus ex machina (omnipotent villain) explanations, but in particular, I think the charge of nihilism is quite accurate. It is not a movie where the message is obvious, or indeed one where you could really categorise as having something profound to say about the futility of revenge or the human condition. That said, as a stylish piece of entertainment I enjoyed it immensely. I have seen Park Chan-Wook's 'JSA' and 'Sympathy For Mr Vengeance' and preferred this film. Whether this makes me a vapid pop-culture victim, so be it, but I honestly have a better time seeing something like 'Performance' or '...if' or even 'Ichi The Killer' than 'The Sorrow and the Pity' or 'Through a Glass Darkly'. Great films, like great literature, can be hard work and not always more rewarding.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"A brilliantly executed, disturbing movie that is a must see","Not having seen any previous films by this director, I went in with an open mind. While I was in Korea in 2004, I asked a few Korean friends, what movies they thought would be worth watching (subtitles permitting!). All of them suggested Oldboy.This film is quite slow to get going but its fitting that you get eased in to the film. It's a very disturbing film and extremely graphic in places. However, I do think its all in keeping with the storyline.To me this is a must see film as a result of the acting, the twists throughout and overall difference that the film puts out to the standard US based movie! If you don't mind some violence and general disturbing content based around torture and violence, then you wont be disappointed.

Poetry in Motion,"one of the most up-and-coming film makers of the day is one Chanwook Park, an auteur from South Korea who just may go down in the history books as the 21st centuries first great storyteller.Revenge. the word itself denotes a certain tingle on the back of your neck. we all know what it means, some of us have even been a part of it's tangled web. Vengeance is the culmination of almost every emotion the human mind is capable of understanding, and some we don't. Chanwook Park has written, directed and produced three film that tackle the psychology, philosophy and grand theme of vengeance, and Oldboy is the second installment and probably the most important.the story is quite convoluted, and much of it should be left to be witnessed with virgin eyes and ears, but sufficing to say that a sully drunk named Oh Dae Su is captured by a man with a purple umbrella one rainy evening after a few hours in the drunk tank. he is kept in a small motel room with a fake window, a TV, an eerie painting and a gas pipe for the duration of 15 years. during this time, he witnesses his wife and child murdered on the 11 o'clock news, and he is framed for it. Dae Su sort of goes into a slow state of focused madness. his body becomes tough and trained, his hair becomes shaggy and beast-like, and his wrist becomes an hourglass, counting the years in checks until his release. When Dae Su is released, he is no longer Dae su, but something else, he's a beast, a monster, an unstoppable force of vengeance created by the rage and sorrow of the former Dae su. he still looks like the same disheveled 40-something, but there is a deadness to him, a crouching killer waiting to spring on his pray- the people who killed his family and put him in that horrible place, but with all the anger inside Dae Su, there still lurks a very human being, one so desperate for contact with another life after 15 years of deprivation, he consumes a living creature as his first meal upon release. this is only the first half hour of the film, and it's really the simplest part of the plot to explain- a precurser. this should give you an idea of how deep and dark this film plunges into the human psyche. for all it's cartoonish moments and stylish look and feel, Oldboy is unmatched in its well of emotion and deeply human story. you are not asked to take what you see as literal occurrence, but rather to accept what you see and draw meaning from it. there are some scenes many people find obligatory, consciously shocking or just plain gross, but they are all necessary in order to understand the epicness of this tale.on a technical scale, Park has taken a complete divergance from his previous effort- Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance and instead gone into a kind of surrealist filmnoir-meets-hong-Kong wonder-world from which this fantastical story can be properly told in the grandios form it requires.a lot of people disliked the ending to this movie, and if you watch this film the same way you watch something like Fight Club or Memento (both fine films) then you wont like it either, but this isn't fight club or memento, this is Shakespeare, this is Homer, this is what lies beneath the gloss and dirt. the core. the story itself is unimportant, it's what the story implies that makes it a masterpiece.i mourn the idea of remaking this film, giving the helm to the man who'll do Fast and the Furious 3, and making the main character go to prison rather than the original mysterious hotel room. all the things that make Oldboy Oldboy are gone, and all we're left with is the homage of someone who obviously missed the point. so i urge you to see this version of the story before it becomes a bastardized memory of itself stuffed into a Pepsi advertisement.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"

"What passes for ""great cinema"" these days . . .","I have watched this movie with great hopes.

As I really LOVE Korean food, I hoped I could say the same about the movie hailed as the Second Coming in some circles.

South Korea's Violent Masterpiece?,"After being kidnapped and imprisoned for fifteen years, Oh Dae-Su is released, only to find that he must discover the reason for his capture in five days.I am a bit surprised to find this film in the top 250. Not that it is not a good film (it is), but it does not seem like the sort of thing that would get the honor. I suppose, certain plot elements aside, it has incredible cinematography (both in movement and color) and excellent directing. The acting is fine, as well.The violence is hard to categorize. On one hand, some of the bloodiest scenes call to find the films of Takashi Miike. But Miike lacks a certain sensibility that Park does not -- this may be a revenge film, but it is also beautiful in a way. The violence, at times, comes off like a well-scripted choreography. Where Miike tries to shock the audience and push the limits, Park seems content to stay just on the edge and make sure it is done in good form.The biggest problem with this film is that it suffers from the same issue that ""The Sixth Sense"" did. While ""Oldboy"" has many twists and surprises, one of them will probably be told to a viewer before he or she watches the movie. And that is unfortunate. Does it ruin the movie to know twists in advance? Maybe not. But it might be best to have things revealed as the story intends them to be.All in all, a solid film. If I had any complaint, I could say the film was a bit long. But the pacing was steady, so it was not an unenjoyable longness.

Squid Pro Quo,"This is one heck of a film experience, a cinematic joyride unlike any in recent memory. A well-crafted tight package it is, of electrifying acting performance (Choi Min-Sik is simply great), innovative cinematography, unbelievably warped story line, bone-jarring action, black humor, all fortified by a moody and captivating music score(it tends to lodge in the recesses of one's right hemisphere, and won't leave).A role that demands a tremendous emotional range, Choi Min-Sik gives one of the most memorable acting performances in recent years. We see a man brimming with bottled up rage for vengeance barreling his way towards the inevitable encounter with his nemesis, and when the moment arrives, we are witness to a heart-wrenching transformation of a broken man pitifully begging for his mute mercy. If there ever is a measurable scale to the emotional spectrum of acting, then Mr. Choi's performance pushes through the untested limits of infrared and ultraviolet. His brilliantly inscrutable and ambiguously formed sweet-and-sour smile(Mona Lisa would be proud) near the end is the singular summation of a tortured soul who has just been reminded of the unbearable cost of his hollow victory. Perhaps it is the smile beneath which a glimpse of the ""monster"" can still be seen. Many will ponder.Throughout the movie, the viewer is treated to some striking imagery which effectively appear almost embossed onto the film. Some of the more memorable scenes appear to be lifted right out of its dramatic Manga frame composition. Dramatic pose of our protagonist holding back the man and his dog, Mr. Han's momentarily frozen Judo form, the ""Great Wave""(poster) of emotion towering over Dae Su.. There is no stylistic over-byte here, just enough dramatic essence distillation to stick. Simply brilliant. Of course, this is in sharp contrast to the infamous hallway fight scene, an all out, no cuts, make-your-palm-sweat realism. This is largely due to Mr. Park's mastery of his directorial craft to match the subject drama and acting.Those cineastes who like their cinematic Martini ""shaken AND stirred"" will no doubt discover a winding, twisted emotional vista, one that we rarely see. A rock and a grain of sand may sink the same, but surely this cinematic de la creme will ascend to its rightful notice.

The action is amazing, especially the hallway scene, which might've inspired Daredevil's season 1 sequence quite a bit. The story is twisted and horrific, but I wouldn't have it any other way.

"Less you know about it, more you can enjoy its forbidden, adventurous and a bumpy ride","It is one of those movies where you can neither guess the reason for the revenge nor the actual end play (by midway). Definitely the emphasis is on style over substance, glorifying goriness than the emotional connect and acting is definitely not its strong suite. Despite its emotional and language barriers, it is a victory for movie making by having a stranglehold on audience attention up until 90% of the movie.Dae-su Oh (Min-sik Choi) is a careless drunk and has rubbed many people the wrong way. On his daughter's birthday, he is abducted and put in a room without giving a reason for the cause. He is put in an independent room of an apartment without any scope for a conversation except for a television, mostly drugged, fed the same duck dumpling and occasionally visited by a hypnotist. As he prepares himself by learning boxing and other martial arts from what he can gather from television to extract revenge on the person who might have done this to him and also digging a tunnel in parallel for his escape, one fine day he is let off after 15 years. Can he do what he has been preparing for?It is a captivating premise to be imprisoned without knowing the reason and source while also keeping the audience in the same state of ignorant mind as the protagonist. This establishes an empathy from the audience who will embark on a journey with the protagonist till the end of story (or the reveal). As the hype builds up over a period of time, it cannot be fizzled out with a run-of-the-mill reason and that's where the story kicks into another least expected dimension. All the loopholes and misfires are temporarily forgotten and we change to the new ride and hop along with a renewed interest which again acts in the movie's favor.A special mention should go to Ji-tae Yu who plays the character Woo-jin Lee, he does it with such elan that makes you think that you are not just seeing a good vs. evil story. The story and screenplay is well thought out and executed that greatly influences how the editing eventually turns out. While the boldness of the content is surely to be appreciated in a mainstream cinema, the way it ends is what emphasizes the grayness of the human mind. A classic generally attributes to how the audience reacted to it rather than how well it is made, in that aspect Oldboy definitely is a cult classic that overcomes the goofy acting, uneven scenes and continuity issues to become something that is much more.Less you know about it, more you can enjoy its forbidden, adventurous and a bumpy ride.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"

The opening of the movie alone is perhaps the coolest opening I have ever seen because when that music started playing and the first scene starts rolling I was in movie heaven. It was one of those perfect moments I guess, and it was all the much harder to believe, because I am no Asian-movie fan. Actually I avoid Asian movies as much as I can because I don't like their storytelling and directing, plus I never remember the faces because they all look the same. I have, since seeing ""Oldboy"", changed my opinion on that. How could I not, the movie has more style that the first two Matrix movies combined, visual effects that are more than equal rivals to any big-budget Hollywood movie, actors that I was somehow able to recognize were amazing, despite having to read the subtitles all the way through, and a music score that has been playing in my head for many days now. And I haven't even gotten to the true core of this movie. It's a story that blew me away, it's a hardcore revenge movie that won't leave you cold. Put all of this into exactly two hours of pure entertainment at it best, countless memorable scenes that are beyond amazing, and give it a dash of perfection. You got it, an instant cult classic. 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
About Incest,"The brutal and almost perverted revenge caused by an unfavorable love is bound to be achieved by causing another unfavorable love. Ignoring the fierce bloody and psychological distortion process for a while, the theme of the film is clearly cleared in a clearer way. This incident of incest is faced with the brave posture of resistance shown by today's powerful ethical and moral system, and some kind of interpersonal crisis of modern people revealed in this stiff and unpretentious posture.
Just as Marquez said in his magical realism masterpiece, the end of incest-a person with a pig tail, modern biological science can also testify to it, incest will lead to deformity of future generations due to the similarity between genes. However, the reason why incest has become a taboo is not such a biological reason. To trace back the history of mankind with the population of the earth today, we can simply make a simple estimate of the population of thousands of years ago or even ancient times, and then we have come up with an impossible number. Such a fact of population growth. This incident proves that incest is not a long-forbidden and rare, but a basic fact of human beings for millions of years. The reason is very simple, it is just a small number of people. In fact, it is difficult to imagine a social organization without incest. Because incest succeeded in preparing the network of in-laws, it enabled the continuation of society, and people in any society without it would be unsustainable.
The birth and reproduction of human beings, from the necessary combination of men and women to family construction to today's monogamy, is a long evolutionary story. From the initial biological, physical, and slowly to the so-called cultural and social evolutionary path of today. One of the basic premises for its realization is the gradual increase in the number of people, so that people no longer have to choose whom to combine from in-laws; at the same time, another more important reason is not fertility distortion, but incest. The disorder caused by human relations makes incest gradually unnecessary and further becomes a taboo.
Therefore, the original primordial incest can actually be generated naturally; now incest has become a problem again. It is actually artificial. The most important thing is of course all kinds of sexual taboo thinking, which causes the so-called sexual repression. Sex has become a shame and even a sinful thing, and the lust can't find an exit. It makes people return to the ancient stone carvings that have only direct blood relatives and only a few heterosexual blood relatives in disguise. . In this way, incest seems to have gone from the ancient ""naturally forced"" occurrence to today's ""artificially forced"" occurrence. And this is the most important reason for the film to be almost invisible but concealed under the modern incest system.
Finally, in the wilderness and snow of the desert, the father realized the detached love with his daughter by choosing to forget. This scene is like the ancient moment when humans are scattered in the earth, but the truth is that this is an extra-legal place free from ethics and social taboos. Love itself is not guilty, even if it is not good, who has hurt it? In fact, it is meaningless to discuss the actual rationality of the ending. It is just a window that condenses the airtight cultural and moral system constructed for modern human civilization, and a buffer that dispels the pressure of the system. Belt for some people who can't bear the burden to take a breath.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
Grown up,"I haven't read the Manga (comic) this is based on, but I can tell you that the movie is very devastating. It also features things that might not be as apparent as they are, especially to western audience members. There is a different sense of honor and sensibility in general, something that is difficult to translate (more on that on my review for the US remake).The lead role is played by great gusto, but the villain of the piece is great too. You can argue about motives all you want and about character decisions (see sensibility and how this movie ends), but it all works out nice. There are quite a few remarkable things happening (especially visually - think octopus and ""Hammer time"" to name a couple - but also tonally or story wise - one very big twist, that is as twisted as it gets) and some will take you by surprise. Unless you have read about them or seen the remake before this. Would be a shame, because if you only watch one Oldboy, make it this one!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
Be prepared,"Oh. My. God. If you ever thought a movie twisted the fabric of your mind as to what is and isn't possible in this modern world of cinema, watch Oldboy and I'm sure it will surpass all your previous notions. Chan-wook Park is a Korean director who specializes in incredible stylistic camera work and artistic cinematography within a carefully constructed narrative. Oldboy is the second film in his aptly named ""vengeance trilogy."" It is about a man who is imprisoned 15 years for unknown reasons. After enduring painful loneliness for all this time, he is released, only to find out he has five days to find out why he was imprisoned. It starts off strange and different, yet don't get discouraged. Everything echoes throughout the film to end with one of the most twisted and stunning climaxes I have ever witnessed. My jaw was left wide open for the last fifteen minutes of this movie, and then about ten more after the credits finished rolling. If it hadn't been so late I might have hit the play button again as soon as I made it back to the DVD menu. It was utterly mind blowing.I was most definitely not prepared going into this film, but it only served to heighten the experience of watching this practically perfect film. Oldboy hits the ground running and within five minutes of the film we get an incredible taste for what Chan-wook Park's filmmaking is all about. It's fast. It's fun. But it's also smart. Amidst the vibrant colors and the beautiful cinematography there is an incredible narrative. As the mystery of this film unravels we are pulled farther and farther in. And of course at the end of the film it just explodes in our faces without hardly any warning. You will be amazed. You will be disturbed. It will most definitely catch you off guard. It was all so expertly done and I just couldn't avert my eyes for one second in fear of missing the mysterious grandeur of this film. Every moment and every character serves the plot to some avail. There isn't a moment in Oldboy that felt unnecessary or overdone. It's one of the brilliantly made films which comes full circle by the end, only wanting you to rewind and watch the whole thing over again, immediately. I can't come up with enough words to describe how awesome this story is. It is definitely one of those you absolutely must see for yourself.I'm sure it's a ballsy statement to make, but Chan-wook Park could be the next Akira Kurosawa, only this time slightly more hardcore, obviously. Every shot of Oldboy is so incredibly crafted, down to the most finite detail. The entire film is handled with such care and precaution, and the results are astounding. There are moments in the film which resonate the style of other master directors. There are multiple shots in the film which are heavily Scorsese influenced, for example. However, there is still an extremely definitive style here which belongs to Park. This style is what prevails over any of the specific influences scattered throughout the film. If Park continues to make films like this he will most likely go down in history as one of the genius auteurs of the 21st century. However, on that same note I would be amazed if he ever made anything that could top Oldboy.Oldboy is one of those films which you will never be able to get out of your head. Whether this is a good or bad thing is up to you, but to me it was a great thing. It's a one of a kind film which could never recreated in it's full glorious essence. There was once talk of an American remake of this film, and I'm not sure I could have stomached that, knowing for a fact that any American team could never top the demented perfection of the original. Oldboy is utterly incredible. Every moment is perfect. It gets everything right and goes farther than you could ever imagine. The best part is that Oldboy doesn't fall into one specific genre of film, making it an example of how practically any film should be made, in essence. It would be a crime to go through life never seeing this film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"

"""Laugh and the world laughs with you. Weep and you weep alone.""","I finally re-watched this masterpiece from Park Chan-wook. When it comes to movies about revenge, I have never seen something as effectively shocking as this was. It made me remember why I was so shaken up by this movie the first time I watched it. Nothing can truly prepare you for the kind of deranged story that unfolds in front you.The plot is about Oh Dae-su, a man who is kidnapped and confined to a prison where, with his only form of contact with the outside world being a television where you see someone of the worlds biggest events he missed out on. He also finds out that his wife is murdered and he is framed for it, leaving his daughter orphaned. He is mysteriously released by his captors after 15 years. He is left unaware who did it, why he did it or why he was released. While his life is consumed with revenge, he also falls in love with a young woman who works in a sushi restaurant. When it comes to extreme violence, this is one of those films where I found a lot of it deeply affecting to the point where I was just completely taken out of my comfort zone the first time I watched it. It is razor sharp in terms of its storytelling and it feels so rich because for all the twisted insanity that involves in front of you, it feels impactful in all the right ways. All of the characters, no matter who they are feel like their motivations are handled properly. Oldboy becomes a better movie with every scene, because every plot point that's revealed to you, it is just consistently riveting and I was noticing a few subtle new things on repeat viewings.All of the performances are superb in this and I feel I would have to spoil things if I was talking about everyone, however I will say that I absolutely adored Choi Min-Sik's performance as Oh Dae-su. Everything is revealed to you from his perspective and everything about his performance feels real and believable. He has that wonderful mix where he is just completely deranged and bad ass, while also having down-to-earth vulnerabilities and weaknesses and this makes him easy to connect with as a viewer. It makes everything revealed to you feel so much more meaningful.His fight scenes.... wow! Just wow! How can something so messed up look so beautiful? The famous hallway scene one of best fight scenes I have ever seen put to film and it is just staggering to me how perfect it looks. It's not so much the martial arts that looks impressive, it's the fact that the film isn't afraid to make the fighting a little raw and sloppy at times which makes for a visceral and painful looking scene. Seeing Oh Dae-su with a switchblade stuck in his back for most of the scene just has me grimacing. And to top of that it is filmed in a beautiful extended long tracking shot. As badass as he is in this film Choi Min-Sik also gives a wonderful physical performance and he looks like he is in pain.... a lot. He sells a character who only has one thing left to fight for in his life and that is revenge and you feel his desperation for it.The music in this film is just beautiful. The use of Vivaldi's 4 Seasons to someone's teeth getting pulled is so indescribably twisted, I just love it! That piece will probably haunt me whenever I go to the dentist now. The rest of the soundtrack is so beautiful it almost brings me to tears listening to it by itself. Jo Yeoung- wook and Shim Hyun-Jung's classical score feels very contrasting to the visuals, and just feels so tragic and melancholic. The last track called The Last Waltz, is one of the most beautiful pieces in the film and just has me deep in thought as I'm meditating and processing everything that has just happened in the film.I also appreciate how you get a few darkly funny moments in there as well. There's one scene early on, while Oh Dae-su is still held prisoner, where he decides to write a list of people who he think might be motivated enough to do something like that to him and he ends up filling up an entire journal of it. There's a few little moments like that where you see humour like that just sprinkled in and I love that. I simply have to see more films from Park Chan-wook, because in my opinion he is one of the best filmmakers of all time. It's both beautiful and brutal to watch at the same and it's just one of those films that held my attention from start to finish. It is such a riveting experience, that the 2 hours just fly by and it's shocking ending makes the film linger on long after it's over. It's a great story where you end up buying into every characters motivations no matter how you look at it and that's what makes Oldboy a truly special experience. I loved every minute of this.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
A Moral Immorality: Tale of a Monster,"Oldboy is a puzzling masterpiece that deeply submerges viewers in a jaw-breaking tale of revenge, redemption, and the intricate interplay of human morality. Rooted in the depths of moral psychology, the film takes its audience on a hair raising though agonizing journey that scrutinizes the complexities of ethical decision-making, the consequences of our actions, and the blurred lines between right and wrong or morality and immorality.The film narrates an excruciating exploration of the aftereffects of vengeance. The protagonist, Oh Dae-su, becomes a pawn in a twisted game of retribution, setting off a chain of events that challenge the very fabric of his moral compass. As the narrative unfolds, the audience is hardly slapped with the question: Can the pursuit of revenge ever be morally justified? The film provides no easy answers, prompting viewers to grapple with the intricate nuances of justice and the ethical implications of one's desires.In fact, Old Boy presents moral psychology through the characters' motivations and actions. Oh Dae-su's relentless quest for retribution leaves us no choice but to question the limits of empathy and compassion. His single-minded pursuit shows the darker aspects of human nature, revealing the depths to which an individual can descend when consumed by vengeance. This transformation is a testament to the instability of morality under extreme circumstances and the precariousness of our ethical foundations.The apparently antagonist character of Lee Woo-jin, adds another layer of moral complexity. His calculated actions challenge conventional notions of right and wrong, pushing the boundaries of moral relativism. The film invites us to examine the rationale behind his elaborate scheme, blurring the line between villain and victim, and shedding light on the intricate motivations that drive his actions. Oldboy also raises the profound question of redemption. As the narrative reaches its climactic moments, the film explores whether individuals can truly atone for their past transgressions. Oh Dae-su's journey towards self-discovery becomes a poignant exploration of moral growth and the possibility of finding absolution, even in the face of unthinkable deeds.Park Chan-wook's flawless direction and the performances of the cast create a hauntingly immersive experience, leaving audiences super shocked and contemplative long after the films ends. As we journey alongside Oh Dae-su through his odyssey of revenge, redemption, and moral reckoning, we are compelled to confront our own moral convictions, challenging us to reflect on the fragile and intricate nature of our ethical compasses.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
A Masterpiece,"This is by a noticeable margin, the best film I have ever seen. I am a film enthusiast rather than a serious critic, but despite never having written a review before I felt compelled to write this. Quite a few reviews of this film have given it a 1 out of 10. This is absurd, all such ratings can be dismissed as the nonsensical ramblings of those who claim to be enlightened but are nothing more than the sort of people who disagree with you just to sound intelligent.At the end of this film I fell in love with it, the deliberately flawed characters, the eclectic directing, the soundtrack, everything. The romance is neither naive nor cynical, the action is realistic (even capturing the occasional absurdity of fighting) and the characters are some of the best written I have ever seen (Oh Dae Su can be compared to a Shakespearian antagonist).You need to watch this film, it will chance your perception of everything for the better.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"

an unusual yet mesmerizing revenge fable,"I will admit right off that bat that I'm not a fan of the whole ""Asian Extreme"" phenomenon sweeping across North America right now; as far as horror goes, my heart is grounded in the Spaghetti Splatter of Fulci and Argento; as for revenge, Charles Bronson always ""makes the bloodlust grow fonder."" ""Oldboy"" takes a bit from both: a man is imprisoned for 15 years without any apparent purpose, and vainly attempts to break free of his shackles; once he does, he seeks out those who put him there, and embarks on a stylized--yet strangely 'civilized'--killing spree. For much of its running time, my reaction to ""Oldboy"" was a stupefied ""huh?"" It has a plot as excessively complicated as a '70s giallo, and often drifts quite far from reality (not really griping, as it provides the film with a disorienting, surreal sheen), but is simply mesmerizing. From the standpoint of visuals and camera work alone, ""Oldboy"" is as beautiful to look at as Dario Argento's ""Deep Red."" However, like Argento, the characters are less prone to expressing their feelings outside the requirements of the plot, and while there is a striking humanity underneath the bloodshed of ""Oldboy""--it simply isn't enough to elevate it above its own obsession with surface quality. Too bad, seeing as how the potential for greatness is certainly present.6.5/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"

When you find out the truth at the end, you will feel very sick, I promise you. I don't know why this movie tried so hard to mimic Japanese movies.

Thank you IMDb people!!,"Yes a shout to all people who reads and posts or votes on IMDb. Because you guys make sure I get to watch movies that are awesome. If it wasn't for IMDb I would have probably missed out on many,many and many more movies, including: Oldboy.When it comes to foreign films I used to be very skeptical. Why? Well most movies I watched when I was young where from Hollywood. But once you really 'open your eyes' you'll see that there are so many great movies not from the movie-factory;Hollywood. like: The Green Butchers, Adam's apples, Oorlogswinter, Grave of the fireflies, Spirited away and not sure but the kite runner. Anyway I think I could make a bigger list but then I wouldn't have time or enough lines to talk about Oldboy.Oldboy starts of very funny. It doesn't really fit the rest of the film but its a great starter. Then it does seem to change drastically. I won't go in detail since I don't want to spoil anything. But every movie has a certain feel to it. The way you feel, like a taste on your tongue, keeps you entertained or not, simple as that. This movie has a very unique feel to it which I haven't seen or felt before. You get really attached to the main character which makes you put aside your own feelings of 'right and wrong' and condone fighting/killing etc.This movie has everything you would expect from a movie. complicated characters but understandable, a unique storyline, love in a special way and twists and turns. But this movie shall never reach the top, as in a score 9+. Why? Because its not a movie every person would want to watch. Some scenes are very ...'special'.Conclusion: Unique movie that is awesome in many many ways but not one to watch with friends or family that wouldn't understand these kind of movies.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"Blind, driven, raging revenge!","Wow, I can't believe some crybaby removed my comment. What's wrong, does the 1st Amendment offend you? First, let me get this off my chest. A lot of people either love this movie or hate it with a passion. The ones who love it are the one's who choose to give something a chance, have an open mind, and already know the best stuff is being made outside the US. The ones who hate this movie well, never mind, it's not worth filling up this space. I did like this movie a lot. Liked it when I first got introduced to it in 2003 by friends in Korea and I still feel it holds up to most movies in its genre. The story in summary is explained by others who've posted review and synopses of the plot so go there to read it but to compare this to Count of Monte Cristo is a bit dumb. Maybe if you stretched it you can see the comparison but come on, seriously? Fans of go-for-broke revenge plots in the vein of Seven will love this movie as it is the closest thing to it. Certainly it has some plot elements that are going to make American audiences squirm but it is a Korean movie not an American movie. Don't be detracted by the people who've given this such negative reviews. It's VERY raw and sometimes brutal but it is a revenge movie at its core. Also, I don't know what ""gore"" people are referring to in this movie as there is no gore. Texas Chainsaw Massacre is gore. Brutality yes, gore? Hardly.

Takashi Miike meets Wong Kar Wai,"When i first saw Oldboy back in 2004, i was just 13 years old. I watched it with my girlfriend at the cinemas just couple of hours after watching Alfonso Cuaron's Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban. I didn't enjoy it that much, but the film does make my girlfriend cry. However, i do like the dialog between Daesu and Woojin, as well as the corridor fight scene.Three years later Oldboy came back to the spotlight. During the recent shootings at the Virginia Tech Institute, Fox News and Sky News claimed that Oldboy inspired the killer Cho Seng Hui to commit crimes. I wasn't much convinced by the news reports, and so i picked up a DVD of Oldboy at the store and try to link this film with the shooter. Because if i remember, this film doesn't have the GTA-style violence that will encourage people to commit violence.Unfortunately, i was right. This film is not that GTA violent at all. And it has only one gun shown at the film. However the good part is that it made me love the film more. Why? Because it made me appreciate the story, the feel, the romance and the tragedy of the film. I'm not really used to Korean cinema, but this film just blew me away.The story of this film tells about Oh Daesu, a man who was sent to the police station on the day of his daughter's birthday. He was bailed by his friend Joo Hwan. However, just as he was to apologize to his daughter on the payphone, he was kidnapped, and was sent to a room with nothing but a television, a toilet and a bed for 15 years.After 15 years, he escaped. He became unfamiliar with the outside world that he hasn't knew for a long time. During the time he was in that room, his only link with the outside world was the television. And he became familiarized with computers and cell phones, thanks to television.However, his world changed. He was accused of murdering his wife while on that room, and his daughter was sent to Sweden. Desperate to know why he was imprisoned for 15 years, he sets out for revenge, hoping to look for the man responsible for imprisoning him in that room.What i like about this film is that it has the brilliance mix of Scorcese combined with a Tarantino-ish dialog and some neo-noir backgrounds. Even if it's not an English film, but it is a film that will appeal to many. The directing was probably the most brilliant piece of artwork you'll see in a film. One scene has Daesu fighting a group of thugs in a corridor, and that scene is taken with one shot, which makes the whole scene look like a painting.So is this film good? Of course it is. Sure there's some sex and nudity, and you'll need to read subtitles to enjoy this film, but the violence? Not that heavy. It's just only teeth removal, tongue cutting and a fight scene between a man and 30 gangsters. It shouldn't be blamed for matters like Virginia Tech shootings. However, if you're looking for a deep & thought-provoking film with touches of Tarantino & Scorcese in it, then look no further than Oldboy.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"One Of The Most Original And Compelling Films Ever Made. ""Oldboy"" Blew Me Away","I personally feel Oldboy is the best film to come out of Asian cinema, it really hit me hard. I loved it from start to finish, this dark tale of revenge is one of the most unique experiences I've ever had. Everything about Oldboy is perfect, the direction, the poetic screenplay, the haunting operatic score and the wonderful acting. Even though Oldboy is a tale of revenge, it has an underlying message of redemption.I mean how can you feel sorry for someone when you don't know what they have done. You see Oldboy questions the viewer, you will falter between feeling sorry for someone and then wondering ""But what did they do to make that person do such a thing?"" The film tests what many viewers can handle, even though the film is disturbing it adds a touch of twisted humour. Chan-wook Park is a director with a lot of talent, he mixes genres perfectly and many different techniques used to create a dark foreboding atmosphere.The dialogue is poetic, deep and meaningful. The phrase ""Laugh, and the world laughs with you, weep, and you weep alone"" is a very true statement. It's the kind of dialogue where you want to sit back and think about it for a second because everything moves with great pacing. The movie is deep and fulfilling. It holds many surprise twists and turns and uses some great shock techniques.The film mixes genres together, mainly using revenge and drama. The movie studies humanity and how a person can hurt someone without realising it. I would say this masterpiece is very psychological because it tests the viewers boundaries of what they can handle in certain places. The movie has a very comic book feel to it because it's based of a Manga series as well as being part of the ""Vengance Trilogy"". The movie helps define the often used term of ""cool"".Oldboy stands high up in a class of it's own, the movie is visual beauty and shows the pain that the characters are going through. The edging menace that weaves it's way throughout the film manages to keep the viewer watching and grasping for more. Oldboy is a film that sticks with you and plays on your mind for a long time after each viewing. The movie is very deep and manages to show things through ""In your face"" technique and subtle imagery through acting. Another genius aspect would be the way you can't really decide who's the bad person is, there are definitely no good characters apart from Dae-su Oh's lover who acts powerfully and with lots of precision.For example one of the great scenes in this masterpiece is the love scene, it shows all the pain Dae-su Oh is going through. The actor Min-sik Choi has been casted perfectly and plays his role as Dae-su Oh with sublime brilliance. The direction is stylish and different, the movie experiments with very clever camera techniques. An example would be the close up of Dae-su Oh in the right hand corner of the screen and the blurred image of someone behind him. Oldboy is an extremely intelligent style of film making that is for a viewer who wants to get something out of the movie they are watching.The movie is somewhat like a Film-Noir, the narration adds depth and powerhouse style to the films undertone. Hence the idea of revenge and telling the tale of something that asks the viewer questions. The movie plays with the mind and twists everything you once thought was correct. The viewer never knows who to trust or what is going to happen next. he movie is unpredictable and feels like a poem of death. The first 40 minutes or so build up a claustrophobic atmosphere. The film shows how our society and class we live in is fuelled by evil.The movie is far from being at action movie and some might say far from being a revenge movie. It's more about lost love, self indulgence and finding inner tranquillity. The acting as mentioned is very powerful and provokes the viewer to ask the one main question that the film offers and that's ""Why?""Another important aspect would be ""Insanity"" and ""What drives a human? What really makes them want to go out and do something?"" Some viewers will be put off from the films high-octane style and grace. But mainly the fact the movie is very twisted and disturbing. Though the added touch of satire adds a crazed ambition. The film actually feels quite Quentin Tarantino like in certain places or at least something that would appeal to his taste in film. The film is unflinching with it's camera use and what is being put fourth in front of the viewer.Perfection, detail and sublime visual flare makes this one of the greatest films ever made. You'll be wanting to see Oldboy again and again as soon as it finishes. The movie is confusing and fulfilling with it's wonderfully sweeping plot line. There is no doubt about it, Oldboy is one of the greatest films of the 21st century.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"

"A Non-Gratuitous, Well-Crafted Extreme Film","Oldboy is a fine movie. In reading some of the negative reviews on IMDb, however, one may be given the impression that this film is gratuitous in its use of violence and sex. Nothing could be further from the truth. Those who have seen this film understand that the sex scene was an important  even ESSENTIAL  event. (This is, mind you, the only movie I can think of that has been able to utilize sex as a significant contribution to a well-crafted storyline.) Thus, the sex was not gratuitous at all, since it served a purpose that becomes all the more obvious as the story progresses. If one wishes to see gratuitous sexual content that adds virtually nothing to a horribly-crafted storyline, one can refer to Izo (directed by Takashi Miike).With regards to those complaining about the film's believability, they are simply attacking a strawman. And I ponder at why these very same criticisms of believability are not applied to such overrated films like The Lord of the Rings or ET. Perhaps because the priority of such films are not in their presentation of believable concepts? In like manner, this film's purpose is to express the consequences implicit within the pursuit of vengeance. Whether or not the events therein are believable or not is inconsequential. Thus, the criticism of unbelievability is logically flawed, and pointless.I have always held that making a film extreme  in and of itself  does not make a good movie. (And I have seen plenty of low quality extreme movies.) That said, there are both bad and good extreme films.

Chan-Wook Park starts with an almost Hitchcock-like tale of a man abducted and held against his will by an enemy he could not see. It is rather moving to see his anger, confusion, and frustration come to the surface. Sometimes the intensity is broken by dark humor, the sort of comic ""relief"" that also serves to ratchet up the tension. And the sense of composition and style is first rate. It seems like it's sometimes a cross between Hitchcock and the Wachowski Brothers.But they you start to see loose threads appear, and instead of tying them up, the climax just makes everything unravel. We know that the hero, Oh Dae-Su, has been the victim of some elaborate plot for revenge or sadism. But then we find out just how elaborate it is, how many things the villain would have had to have under his thumb to make them not be coincidences, how many times Oh Dae-Su had to make the wrong choice, and just as importantly, how many times he had to escape getting killed by dozens of thugs at the wrong moment. At this point, the movie stops being an assault on our sensibilities, and turns into an assault on the willing suspension of disbelief. There's a fine line between shock and schlock, the sort of violence that produces horror and the sort of violence that is so unbelievable it can only produce numbness or laughter. I can appreciate both, but Oldboy crosses the line into schlock at the end - and seemingly doesn't realize it. ""Laugh, and the world laughs with you?"" Maybe not, in this case...When Hitchcock went for shocking, he could leave you thinking that the world is twisted and sick. Chan-Wook Park only succeeds in leaving you thinking his own imagination is twisted and sick. Not really the same sort of shock.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"A Brilliant, Artistically Accomplished Thriller","In Oldboy Choi Min-Shik (of Shiri fame) plays Dae-su, a man kidnapped and imprisoned for 15 years in a single room apartment, before being released and given 5 days to discover the reason for his imprisonment. Okay, so you know the basic premise of this film. What is hard to convey is the sheer excellence of the performances in this film, or the artistically intriguing camera shots or even the absorbing nature of this intriguing thriller. Every scene looks stunning, the lighting and sets seem perfect from the drab prison walls that actually make you feel ill, to the cold steel of the office building with its clean lines and vapid design. Great care and attention has been taken when planning this film, and it shows. Park Chan-Wook deserves much acclaim for his direction and sheer effort in bringing this film to screen. The plot is also intriguing yet not overly complex and the pace of the film is punctuated by scenes of extreme violence which are somewhat disturbing, but never gratuitous when balanced against the nature of the world Dae-su has descended into. But all of the sets and direction only gain cachet when placed next to the performances of the two main players; Choi Min-Shik (who is simply astounding in probably his best role to date) and Yu Ji-Tae (from the enjoyable Korean horror/thriller Into the Mirror). Both men put in staggering performances of particularly extreme characters without seeming too grandiose. This baroque thriller is simply not to be missed by any fan of thrillers or Asian cinema. Yet I would warn those who have issues with screen violence and somewhat disturbing subject matter to look elsewhere. But all in all, I hold this film up as a true masterpiece, and unquestionably one of the best thrillers to be made yet.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
Highly recommended,"Don't let that title fool you (or the reviews from people that don't understand genre)this horrifying revenge thriller from Korea's dark maestro Park Chan-wook, who gave us the wonderful Sympathy for Mr Vengeance is making the British and American offerings in this genre look pretty quaint. Oldboy has touches of Kafka, and echoes of British paranoia thrillers like The Ipcress File and The Prisoner. But it opens up a whole new sicko frontier of exotic horror, and more or less reduced my intestines to guacamole both times I watched it, not so much with its violence - although heaven knows there's a super-sized helping of that - but with a queasily ingenious imprisonment-torture impossible to contemplate without a prickling of cold sweat.Oldboy certainly shows that it's Asia where the farthest reaches of extreme cinema are to be found, and the worst nightmare is that 15 years in prison, which leaves the numbed viewer wondering if that is an unspeakably long time - or perhaps an unspeakably short time in the nihilist wasteland Park conjures up. ""What happens after you've revenged yourself?"" wonders Dae-su. ""I bet the hidden pain will come back."" This is cinema that holds an edge of cold steel against your throat.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"

Some scenes are beautifully shot and if you don't have an issue with subtitles (or speak fluent Korean) then you will definitely get something out of this film.The point the film is making is not a new one but it makes it very well.

Vertigo,"No movie stands alone. When we watch it, we bring all sorts of expectations to it, and a large part of that is the genre we expect. If we expect style, we are particularly acute in how we judge that factor, for instance.In fact, we've come to rely on how a film announces itself. What I find interesting about this one is that it deliberately subverts any expectations we might have along these lines.For example, most viewers will consider this a ""revenge"" movie, a very specific subgenre, and judge it on those merits. The problem is that the filmmaker goes out of his way early in the game to announce that these fellows are correct in their assumptions.He then pulls the rug out from under those simple viewers, just as he does the hero. That's the art here, and you'll have to judge just how important it is to you.I've become aware in the last few years how important the entry into a film is. The biggest, most shocking thing a filmmaker does is take us to another world. There are two big jumps he or she needs to make. The first jump is in the first few minutes, where the nature of the work is presented. If the movie is a strict genre film, this is easy because we have so many shorthand designators. Music is important.The second big step has to do with the first plot point. In this case, the episode tells us that the hero (our surrogate) sees only what is intended. His perception is bent, manipulated. His TeeVee is our movie.I registered this against films that weave stories about how stories are woven. The touchstone of course is ""Vertigo,"" where two forces or beings on screen struggle to create a ""movie"" in front of us, each one trying to define a false future that merges with the similar future of the movie we watch.""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind,"" ""Open Your Eyes,"" even ""Tampopo"" are examples of this notion of storytelling, one that is intelligent and engaging. We have three entities as creators here. We have the guy we think is the master creator, Park, who we see borrows images as if he were in a drugged dream and can dream only in terms that he saw before he was locked up and gassed.We have the supposed master manipulator, who hypnotizes, drugs, confines, bribes, and uses force and technology to make things turn out precisely the way he wants. Precisely, with no misstep whatever. Nominally he is the one creating the reality we see, but his manipulation is more perfect than that even of Park, so we know he is suspect.And then we have the fellow that seems to be the puppet. But is he? He is the one that writes. Such comprehensive notebooks or diaries are common code in movies for something we enter. He is the one who dreams, for whom the images on TeeVee become a fantasy life replacing the ""real"" one.He is the one with the interesting hallucinations that start with the purely hallucinogenic notion of exiting from a truck onto a grassy rooftop. He is the one who eats life, and in fact traces his roots back to the manipulator by surveying restaurants.That business about snow and lost tongue and erased memory at the end. Shouldn't that tell us who imagined or created what we see? This idea originated in ""2001,"" where Kubrick played with the notion of who was narrating what we see: is it man, computer or deity? See this. Register it so that you can enjoy it.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.",,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"Fun, but ultimately flawed","I wasn't able to find the time to see Oldboy at the cinema despite the overwhelming praise it received on release, so I had to wait until today to see the DVD.Looking at the voting results here the split between the usual ""love it"" or ""hate it"" responses are even more marked than usual and I've been looking forward to the DVD release so that I could make up my own mind. I'm a little disappointed to admit that I neither love or hate Oldboy.Oldboy is not a bad film, but it didn't bowl me over as I'd been hoping - maybe the months of anticipation meant that my hopes were always going to be dashed.The main problem with this movie is that it's just not very well explained. OK, that can be expected in the beginning where we are all as confused as Dae-su Oh, but too much of Oldboy is played out without the audience having much of an idea about what they're seeing.The explanation, when it arrives after a brief period of simplistic detective work, is something of a disappointment and, frankly, seems fairly trivial compared to the effort expended on exacting revenge for it. Dae-su Oh had forgotten the incident himself, and I really couldn't blame him.Overall, definitely worth watching for the great atmosphere and some nice set pieces, but a little underwhelming in the final analysis.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"

One of the best South Korean action films ever made.,"Some storylines are so timeless; they can't help to be made into something modern-thus becoming timeless in the process. Oldboy (2003) can easily draw comparisons to The Count of Monte Cristo in its structure but adds depth and layers to a wild ride that unfortunately could not be even closely matched in its American remake in 2013. As it stands, Oldboy is one of the pillars that shows how culturally significant South Korean cinema has been and how its predecessors like Parasite (2019) and Minari (2020) stood on its shoulders to achieve greatness.Oldboy is a lot like Memento (2000) in that it demands a second viewing, often right after reaching the end credits. Many of the plot's twists and turns readjust the viewer's understanding of previous events-to the point where you'll have to watch it again with this new knowledge fresh in your mind, thus opening up a whole new experience to the film. Revenge is piled upon revenge, but the motivation of these characters is always clear, even if it is uncomfortable at times. Oldboy certainly doesn't pull its punches when it comes to sex or violence, but don't let that distract you from the engaging story.In fact, I would hope that anyone who likes well-done action sequences will take the time to watch this movie. Without spoiling it, I can honestly say there is a moment with a hammer that is as hilarious as it is disturbing. And sure, it might be a bit over-the-top at times, but what action film doesn't land in this pitfall and still manage to entertain? Either way, by the end of the movie, both the characters and the audience are ultimately changed by what they just learned and saw, respectively.One of the best South Korean action films ever made, I give Oldboy 5.0 stars out of 5.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"15 Years Of Imprisonment, Five Days Of Vengeance...A Korean Masterpiece!!","Oldboy (Oldeuboi) is the second installment of the 'Vengeance trilogy' directed by Chan-wook Park and is by far the best of the three.The first time I watched Oldboy it blew me away. Dark, slick, gritty and twisted, revenge has never been portrayed sweeter. I fell in love with the film instantly, I became gripped to my TV within the first five minutes. It kicks off right from the beginning and unlike some other films you don't have to wait half an hour to get interested. It seems quite straight forward a man (Oh Dae-su played by Choi Min-sik) is suddenly kidnapped and is imprisoned for 15 years without explanation and one day he is suddenly released. Now the protagonist is on the hunt for the man who's behind his imprisonment to get his revenge, however the story is more complex and gripping than that.Like me most people would probably assume that the film will go on and in the end the villain will be revealed however Oldboy is quite unique. After Oh Dae-su is released his captor Woo-Jin (Yoo Ji-tae) one day reveals himself. Oh Dae-su instant reaction is to kill this man however Woo-Jin tells him that if he kills him he won't ever find out his motives behind his imprisonment. Woo-Jin then tells Oh Dae-su to discover his motives within the next five days or else he will kill Mi- do (Kang-Hye Jeong) a young sushi chef who Oh Dae-su meets at the restaurant she works at after he got released, she becomes Oh Dae-su's love interest. If Oh Dae-su succeeds in finding out Woo-Jin's motive then Woo-Jin will kill himself. With the captor revealing himself begins the protagonist's desperate journey to find out why he was kept in a room for 15 years, which leads him to dig in his past. This makes the story so intense and entertaining.Oldboy is more than just revenge, blood and the typical overdose of violence it has a very intriguing plot portrayed very sleekly. For people that don't have a strong stomach it will disturb and disgust you(still watch it), some scenes will make your jaw drop, other scenes will make you speechless. There is nothing quite like Oldboy, it has all the correct ingredients. Chan-wook Park filmed every scene as if it's a piece of art; so stylish, bold and dark it seems as if we was to watch and feel the emotions of Oh Dae-su throughout the film. There's some amazing soundtrack and even better dialogue, everything just fits perfectly.Choi Min-sik's portrayal of Oh Dae-su is one of the best performances I have ever seen. It's gripping and mesmerising, it sticks with you no matter however many times you watch it, such a powerful and striking performance. I've never seen anyone get in to the role and portray anger in such a breath taking way as well as Choi Min-sik. Yoo Ji-tae and Kang-Hye Jeong also gave outstanding performances.For the people who haven't watched Oldboy I encourage you to watch it ASAP, it's a must see. I guarantee that you will not leave your seats, it's that entertaining. This film takes cinema to a whole new level, it breaks every barrier in ever aspect whether it's direction, acting, cinematography or background score. Oldboy has changed my outlook of cinema and after watching it everything else seemed mainstreamed to me; that's how much of an impact Oldboy has on me. I've lost count of the amount of times I've watched Oldboy, even though I know what will happen next, I was still gripped and entertained. Oldboy is in my top 5 all time favorite movies and I don't think any movie will be able to take it's place.Source of link: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0364569/",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"

"Dark, stylish, engaging stuff that will appeal to modern audiences even if the lack of depth is a problem","Having been collected in a drunken state from the police station by his friend, Oh Dae-su vanishes from the street and awakes in a locked room. Months later he knows nothing more about why he is imprisoned and is brought food. A year later he has been framed for the murder of his wife but still is none the wiser why he has been imprisoned or by whom. Fifteen years pass by and Dae-su has spent most of them driven by rage an a desire to get free from his prison. A month from breaking though the wall he is gassed and dumped on a roof garden inside a suitcase.Being, in essence, a wuss, I took my time getting round to watching this film and braced myself when channel 4 trailed it with warnings for brutal violence, torture, sexual scenes and ""a scene where a man eats a live octopus""  suffice to say I was ready that this film wasn't going to be Disney. That said there is a feel of graphic novel about this (I think this is where the material has come from) and for all its brutality there is a dark sense of humour running across it. The plot is engaging mainly due to the level of mystery in it and I was held unto the end. The conclusion is drawn out for a bit too long but it is still quite clever and satisfyingly downbeat. Viewers should brace themselves for a certain amount of lack of logic across the plot  this comes with the heavily stylised territory and doesn't damage the arch of the film that much.It is of course violent; there is no disputing that, and I did have to look away from the screen on several occasions. The torture scenes and such are within a dark context though and I found it a lot less violent than some Hollywood films that draw pleasure from gore and death  here it is dark and unpleasant and rarely exciting. Park's direction is impressive and the film has a great fell to it with plenty of style and clever touches but not to the point where it dominates proceedings  the style is the polish, not the whole show. The cast work surprisingly well considering that the depth of the film and characters does rely heavily on the rather convoluted and unrealistic setup. Choi is a powerful heart to the film, starting as a flabby drunk, transforming with rage and hate to the point of looking totally different while also making other significant shifts. The film very much belongs to him but he is well supported throughout. With perhaps weaker characters to work with Kang is good as Mido while Yu turns in a compelling and sinister character without ever losing touch with what has been driving him all these years.Overall then an impressively dark and compelling film. The violent scenes (and one intense scene of animal cruelty) will put many off, as will the fact that the film doesn't happen in a real world but regardless it is stylish, engaging and compelling.",,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"

Stylish thriller that falls apart at the end,"Interesting premise (man is locked away for 15 years by a mysterious organization and isn't told what he's done or how long he's going to be there), beautiful photography, good acting and a director with real flair combine to make a very good movie that could have been great if it didn't go off into outer space at the end.The character Oh-Dae Su starts off as completely unsympathetic--a drunken, annoying, loud-mouthed, obnoxious jerk who's sitting in a police station after obviously having been arrested for drunk and disorderly. He's eventually released, but soon afterward finds himself locked in what at first appears to be a jail cell but turns out to be a fairly well-appointed room, complete with TV. However, he soon realizes that it's not any kind of government jail or prison; it's run by a mysterious private organization, and no one will tell him why he's there or for how long and, in fact, he never sees another human being in all the time he's there. What he does see is a news report on the TV that his wife has been killed, his daughter has been taken away and that he is the prime suspect in the murder, but he knows he didn't do it because he had been locked up in that room. It's not long before he begins to go crazy, trying to figure out why someone would go to the trouble of locking him up and framing him for his wife's murder. Eventually he escapes after having been locked in his ""cell"" for 15 years--or did he really ""escape""? The all-seeing, all-powerful organization seemingly knows not only his every move, but knows what he'll do before he does. He meets a beautiful young chef in a sushi restaurant and moves in with her--but is she what she seems to be? Things snowball from there, and the plot twists, turns and surprises will have you going. It's been mentioned by others that this is a ""nasty"" film, but it's really not. There are some brutal violent scenes, but the ""nastiness"" is much more of an atmospheric nature. Although beautifully shot and brightly lit, the tone of the film is dark and oppressive (a nice contrast) and parts of it will definitely have you on the edge of your seat.However, the last half-hour or so of the movie went completely awry. I won't say exactly what happens for the sake of not spoiling the ending, but suffice it to say that it will most likely leave you shaking your head saying, ""What the hell is going on here?"" However, even taking into account the disappointing last part of the movie, the film itself is still worth a look. It has more pluses than minuses, the actress who plays Mi-Do is gorgeous (that always helps) and has several not particularly gratuitous sex scenes (that always helps even more) and it does give you a lot to think about.

A modern classic.,"Oldboy is a great film. Not only did it put South Korea on the cinematic map, it did so while delivering a great, psychological horror story, told with a completely fresh flair and style.It is a violent film. The violence is over-the-top and shocking, with scenes of torture and bloodletting that are grotesque and wince-inducing. However, Oldboy has little in common with the stereotypical action or gore movie, in which the focus is on the violence itself rather than trivialities like plot, characters and themes. In such works, the events in the film function mostly as a tiresome haul that needs to be completed before the satisfying arrival at the blood-splattered money shot. Oldboy, on the other hand, smoothly weaves the violence into its story in a natural and unforced manner. Also, by refusing to shy away from the images of obscene violence, the film puts an uncomfortable magnifying glass over the ugly side of revenge. Showing the disturbing violence for what it is rather than glorifying it, it makes an impression that lasts far longer than that of Tarantino's shallow revenge fantasies.After his previous work, Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance, director Park Chan-Wook went a whole new direction. While that film was slow-paced to the point of being meditative, and had stylistic touches but maintained a cold realism, Oldboy is fast and stylish and bursting at the seams with cinematic ideas. Film-wise it follows an anything-goes principle, and it does so without ever feeling silly or excessive. The unexpected use of CGI, unexpected violence, unexpected turns of the story – everything is designed to catch the first-time viewer off-guard. Yet despite this, the film flows beautifully and makes perfect sense.The combination of music – everything from low-key electronic loops to intense Vivaldi pieces – and images is simply fantastic. Every shot is eye-catching, from the dark and crumbling slums of the city to the antagonist's sterile penthouse and the final scenes' snow-covered mountain tops. It is a film that is great both to look at and listen to. Even so, it avoids making Tarsem Singh's (director of The Cell and The Fall) mistake of letting the images be the entire film. Instead, Oldboy's story more than holds its own against the visuals and soundtrack. When the film's final revelation comes crashing down, it is as shocking to the audience as it is to the protagonist. This ""twist"" scene also has one of the movie's greatest, tensest build-ups; if only for this single moment, the movie is well worth watching.Oldboy is an example of a filmmaker having a good vision, the means to make it a reality, and the dedication and talent to pull it off. Direction, story and actors work together so well, it makes creating something like this look easy. If you can handle the violence, you will find an extremely well-written, creative, dramatic, humorous, original and entertaining film, one that takes you for a cinematic roller-coaster ride in its truest sense. A must-see.",,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
Pretty good but slightly overrated,"Before seeing Oldboy, I had heard a lot of good things about it. Many of my friends loved it and many respectable critics also praised the movie. The fact that it won prestigious awards from numerous festivals doesn't hurt either. However, this film seems to be the kind of ""hate it or love it"" type of film. Even in IMDb.com, many people believed this is one of the greatest films coming out of Korean while others said it sucks.For me, after seeing it, I feel that it is a pretty good movie, visually stunning with sharp script and dialogs. All the actors did good jobs on their parts. Choi Min-Sik gave us a good performance as Dae-Su and so did Yu Ji-tae as Woo-Jin. The chemistry between these two is so good that we can feel the intense between them. However, as smart as the script is, the film suffers from the over-dramatized ending, typical for Korean movies (IMHO only). It seems like after a superb first 90 minutes of the film or so, the director tried too hard to impress us with the ending. The last scene between Dae-Su and Woo-Jin is totally too intentional and over-dramatic; I was disgusted. For me, it is sad because the film, a little after its first half, was on its way to be the best movie from Korean in my list. The ending, however, ruined it all; it's like after eating half a bowl of delicious soup, you find out that there is a pubic hair in it.Anyway, it's not a bad movie, by all means. Kudos to Choi Min-Sik for his great performance in the first half of the film; he really put a lot of effort to it. Park Chan-Wook, the director, is, well, still Park Chan-Wook; great potential but never fully materialize his greatness. I'll look forward to his next film if he can really make it next time.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
Unmissable,"As controversial, violent (both physically and emotionally), relevant and unmissable as it has been pitched, Oldboy is one of those rare films that crawls under your skin while you're watching it and even more so once it's finished.Dae-Su is kidnapped and held captive in a hotel bedroom-like prison until his release 15 years later. With absolutely no contact with the outside word, save for a TV set, he embarks on a quest for revenge and answers, while being regularly contacted by his captor teasing him with clues for his identity and the reason why he was held captive. Oldboy is a gut- punching tale of revenge, rage, frustration and anger riddled with mystery and an overabundance of twists and turns that despite borderline far-fetched, delivers an unmeasurable payoff.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
a nice experiment in film but ultimately too contrived to be great,"Old boy is not a realistic film. Its characters are cut outs from some hyper thriller genre. Its plot twists are obvious devices to move the story along. And if these things mentioned are not important to you than it is likely you will be entertained by everything else; the camera trickery, the shocking torture scenes, and the comic book inspired story.Old boy is a film made in a Hollywood vein. It is more sensational than anything else. In order to move the characters along Park has placed devices (deus ex machina) with the use of planted cell phones, surprises in boxes, uncovering things the viewer nor the main character, Oh Dae-su, had known. Is this a bad device? No. Its a common device used in many films. Could the story work without these devices? No. And because of this Oldboy works in the thriller genre. Yet Oldboy doesn't surpass any kind of film conventions in this in this genre to receive special praise.The torture scenes are used more to shock than to tell anything new in the story. An example of a film where torture, very graphic torture, is not some cliché shock device but more so a comment on human relationships, pain, societal indifference, is Takashi Miike's film, Audition.Lets not be so hasty in disregarding this film as bad, because bad it is not. It has moments. The opening is definitely an attention grabber - a guy holding a poodle being held by his tie from a building rooftop by some dark faced figure, Oh Dae-su's pleading, after finding out the biggest secret (plot twist), where he performs a disturbing masochistic act, and of course the one long take of the fight scene where Dae-su beats up some forty people. All that is cool. And the film throughout was cool, maybe mostly cool for cool's sake, until the end.So if you're looking for entertainment with torture, blood, sex, fighting, topped with a comic like story of revenge, this film will definitely work for you.

"Pointless, Senseless and Repugnant","Try as I may I cannot for the life of me understand the slack given to the type of rubbish like this. Let me rephrase, it's more than slack, in some cases there has actually been critical acclaim. For what?! Please stop it with the references to Oedipus Rex, Beckett, Count of Monte Christo, Hitchcock or whatever. This is a C grade exploitation film, poorly cast, poorly directed, poorly shot, poorly edited, poorly everything. It is one small step better than another waste of film that came out a few years ago which I believe was called ""Audition"" I think by a guy named Miike Tadashi. (Too lazy to check now). The amount of attention that crap got blew me away. I remember when Japanese cinema used to be acclaimed for Ozu, Oshima, Kurosawa, Mizoguchi, Ichikawa, Teshigahara and others. Those were real filmmakers. Miike is nobody.That's as far as Japan goes. Surely there must be some South Koreans who are doing better things than this Sickboy.The only reason I give it a 2 instead of a 1 is because the very initial premise IS indeed interesting but is handled so incompetently and sophomorically that you might as well be watching a snuff film. In fact, if the octopus counts, it is somewhat of a snuff film. Just as violent and just as juvenile as Tarantino but without his (for lack of a better word) ""talent"".Basically a completely vile and disgusting exercise that should be relegated to the cutout bin.",2.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"Never has someone's action and another's reaction sparked endless chains of ""action-reaction"" events that are so devastatingly depicted in a motion picture before.","Critically-lauded and an audience favorite, Oldboy is arguably Park Chan-wook's best film to date, and one of the key works of contemporary Korean cinema. Winning the Jury Prize at Cannes, Oldboy lets fly an intoxicating sense of atmosphere, an otherworldly, surrealistic feeling that sucks the viewer into the ghoulish noir world Park has conceived. We are introduced to the lead character, Oh Dae-su (Choi Min-sik), at the onset whose life story forms the core of Oldboy.Park's objective treatment of Dae-su is clever. The latter appears to be relating his story to the audience but it seems he is just as confused as we are. Yet we are willing to listen to him, to empathize with his situation, and to follow him on his quest to dig for the truth. Now, Dae-su is quite a poor chap. He has been locked alone in a room by a captor for the last 15 years, and then out of a sudden he is released with only five days to unravel the mystery and find his captor.Oldboy starts out as a promising mystery-thriller, then turns into a love story, and then becomes a mob-vengeance flick. And when the pieces seem to have fit the puzzle, Park pulls the rug under us with a stunning revelation that builds the film up to its tragic conclusion. It is difficult to pigeonhole Oldboy into one or two specific genres because it breaks the conventions of every associated genre, resulting in a film best left to be admired and appreciated according to its own terms.Park is a very skilled filmmaker; he has created a signature visual style that is present in most of his works – a morbid coldness that gives viewers a sense of unease through odd color tones, unorthodox shots, and numbing violence that seem almost too nonchalant. While he could be accused of being overly indulgent in brutality in Thirst (2009), in Oldboy however, the violence makes complete sense.A few of them remain etched in my mind. One, the tooth torture scene in all of its g(l)ory. Two, the tongue-cutting scene, which is more painful than it impliedly suggests. And lastly, the controversial scene that shows Dae-su eating a huge octopus alive after he is released from captivity. Now, you may wonder why Park goes to such an extreme extent to shoot these ghastly scenes of suffering. The reason is simple – causal action brings about consequential reaction.As Park slowly reveals key plot points during the course of the film, it becomes clear that violence is not a means to an end itself (this is the nature of many ""torture porn"" films), but a meaningful part of a whole. Mi-do (Kang Hye-jeong), a young woman who works in a sushi bar, meets Dae-su and falls in love with him at an inopportune time at the crossroads of violence. When not seeking sexual solace in Mi-do, Dae-su would react (almost always violently) against his captives.In perhaps Oldboy's most brilliant sequence (a nostalgic throwback to those Street Fighter video games), Park choreographs a long take showing Dae-su fending off hordes of knife-wielding, rod-swinging street gangsters as he makes his way along a dirty, dimly-lit corridor from left to right. Such is his determination to stay alive that even with a knife plunged into his back, he continues to punch his way through.Misogynistic and cold-blooded, Oldboy is Park's vision of a world ravaged by tyranny, vengeance, misanthropy and masochism. Yet, he finds bizarre beauty in all of this ugliness. Based on a comic by Minegishi, Park's story is absorbing and consumes you whole. Never has someone's action and another's reaction sparked endless chains of ""action-reaction"" events that are so devastatingly depicted in a motion picture before. I could only offer my sympathies to the characters. Even then, I know that is not enough.SCORE: 9/10 (www.filmnomenon.blogspot.com) All rights reserved!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"

Complex thriller,"Lets start saying that OLDBOY recently got the 2004 Jury Prize at the Cannes Film Festival;  probably the most prestigious Film Festival in the world, so that must mean something about this movie.Directed by Chanwook Park a Korean director, who was also responsible for Joint Security Area and Sympathy of Vengeance two dark superb and unexpected thrillers albeit somehow slow for the American taste?This time, pace is a lot faster, but the movie takes the darkness of his previous work to unexpected limits.The story seems simple. Drunk and irresponsible men is kidnapped one night and kept captive for a long time, in a room with a TV set.  His wife is killed at the same moment, becoming the prime suspect; his daughter sends to foster parents.He plots to escape and get revenge on his kidnapers, but everyday he is treated with brainwash drugs and hypnosis.  After 15 years he is suddenly released without any explanation.  He receives money and a cell phone, from where a voice tells him that he must seek revenge.With the help of a young woman he accidentally meets, he starts seeking his captors in a growing spiral of violence, but everybody around him seems to be part of a plot leading him to unexpected situations.What starts as a vengeance movie, slowly becomes a puzzle where all pieces match by the end.  This is like THE SIX SENSE without the phantasms.Chanwook Park has created a movie about the human condition, about the subjectivity of good and bad.  When the movie reaches its conclusion, all-moral values are destroyed and many people will be looking for the purifying fire that never arrives.  I cannot tell more without spoiling the movie, but let us just say that according to this movie, SIN IS A MATTER OF KNOWLEDGE.Beware; this movie is for adults. Not because of the sex scenes that are just what the movie needed  or the violence that is probably more than necessary, but because no young person could ever understand how deeply philosophical this movie gets.",,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
Doesn't live up to the hype. I'd call it fantasy mystery,"Finally took a bit of time to watch this one and despite the rave reviews I can only say that I was disappointed. Although the premise was interesting, I found the storyline predictable and the production suffers from horrendous supporting actors throughout. The narrative, which attempts to deepen your understanding of the main character, felt very old and tired. Maybe I expect too much, but I felt that I'd heard some of these narrated character development lines in many other movies. I felt that the use of humor throughout, particularly during tense/emotional scenes made it hard for me believe in the characters' choices/actions. Many times I felt like this reduced the quality of what was trying to be communicated. All that said, expert cinematography and an engaging soundtrack music make the film worthwhile.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
Totally absorbing...........one of the best films I've seen in a long time,"I watched this film without really knowing anything about it - I just read the IMDb quick summary on what it was about - and seeing it praised so highly and a colleague of mine saying to watch it and it is a must see - I buckled down on it on a Friday night.I was expecting this to be some sort of typical revenge film but with a deep meaning - why would it be rated so highly then? The good thing about the film is that it doesn't give you answers straight away and does a terrific job of keeping you engaged all the way through. You get to know the main character who has gone through years of torment for some unknown reasos as you experience his pain as Oh dae Su (Choi Min Sik) becomes a tormented man in his struggle for vengeance.All I can say is that this film takes you down some paths that you think at one point - 'oh no they really are falling for clichés' but then it goes down something darker and you are totally blown away by what the conclusion is. I am usually a sucker when it comes to finding out twists as I can barely spot them but let me say the twist in this one I did not suspect one bit and was shocked by what I saw.This is a unique film - the acting is perfect, the idea is clever and the emotions portrayed in the characters all exhibit human traits of being torn inside while still alive and just the whacky thing we can do to people to get our peace of mind if only temporarily.All I can say is that you must see this film and it is a film I will be recommending to everyone to see.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
A masterpiece from South Korea,"Oldboy is a film that hit me like a sledge-hammer. It is a remarkable film about the dangers of how revenge can consume you.

Revenge Was Never This Vile !!!,"A Violent & Degenerate Masterpiece which compelled me to not take my eyes off of the film for even a second. The Second film in Chan-Wook Park's Vengeance Trilogy, its the story of Oh Dae-Su who was kidnapped and kept in solitary confinement for 15 years, and after his release he goes on a bloody rampage to find out who captured him & why. What follows is a revenge saga which is so twisted & vile, & yet so humane & heartwrenching. The Director has his own visual style & so many amazing frames are present in the film with Great Soundtrack. There is a jaw dropping action scene in the middle which probably inspired Daredevil's Fight Scenes. Choi Min-Sik in the lead is utterly phenomenal.

Oldboy = Oh boy! Looking further than western cinema...,"OldboyIs a brilliantly directed thriller by Chan-wook Park. Its tells the story of a guy who has been kidnapped and then after 15 years imprisoned in a room is let free, however he instantly seeks revenge on the guy who put him there.The story is excellent with a plot that shows depth and keeps you guessing right until the very last shot. The film starts strangely in a holding area at a police station and this is where we get to see the lead character 'Oh Dea-su'. Right from the off, you sense this person is an unstable character displaying very erratic behaviour. He talks a lot & changing from one emotion to the next in an instant, however we are lead to believe this is due to the fact he has been drinking when his friend comes to bail him out.Once out of the station he stops to make a phone call home when he is taken. The next time we see him, he is in a room looking unclean and dazed. 15 years passes by with nothing but a TV for company. This is one of the most important parts of the film, which the director perfectly puts across to the audience, you do feel the isolation he feels, the torment of 15yrs, wondering why he is there, when is he getting out, all these feelings / questions are asked by our lead.When Oh Dea-su is free he befriends a young lady who has taken such a liking to him she enters into his world, helping him find the man he want to seek revenge upon. Once he comes face to face with his enemy, all is not what it seems, as he tells our lead revenge cannot occur as you will always be left wondering why he imprisoned him so the reason must be uncovered and then the two will meet again.The film has so much on offer, some will point to the fact it might be too unrealistic yet you will not care for such a statement as the acting is great. Every actor portraying each role in a very realistic manner and thus you can really feel for each one individually on the same level. The director includes a wonderfully shot fight scene, where numerous men take on Oh Dea-Su in battle allowing for us to watch as if the side of the house has been cut open for viewing! When we follow our lead into his journey of discovery, there are disturbing parts of the film which are done tastefully and not over exposed.Although there is a memorable scene which is not so tasteful (or tasteful for our lead!) which will leave people squirming even the non-squeamish but had to be shown in this manner in order to be credible to the character. Flashbacks are used to show past events inside the mind of the characters which for some people is off putting but for me helps gather a sense of what really happened rather than relying on verbal two-ing and throwing. There is symbolism included in many shots and the director likes to revert back to earlier dialogue which wraps the story up delightfully.Overall Oldboy is world cinema at its highest quality. A colourful piece of cinematography from a notable director which I believe will no doubt see a Hollywood remake. If this does occur the only director I can see doing Oldboy justice is Quentin Tarantino. There are some people who will walk away from this film stating it was good but not amazing, however what I hope the majority will take away from Oldboy is a greater sense of appreciation for Eastern society film making.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"A dark and uncompromising tale that seeks to prove that when seeking vengeance, you should dig at least two graves.","Vengeance - whether it be cold, calculating and entirely unnecessary or passionate, angry and ultimately fruitless - is depicted as an all-encompassing, life-ruining reflection of one's own inner emotions in this disturbing South Korean revenge thriller that pulls no punches and is vehement in its core ideology that when seeking retribution, you must first dig two graves. No-one escapes unscathed in 'Oldboy (2003)' and the so-called 'crimes' for which penance is being sought are so petty that when they're revealed you realise that the villain's motivations were actually to simply avoid placing the guilt upon himself (the only reasonable party). When the film reaches its heart-breaking, tragic finale it will leave you as devastated as the protagonist, before it all ends on one of the most deceivingly dark notes of the last few years. Yet, besides the fantastically well thought-out plot that's told with some brilliantly intelligent writing, the feature also relies on it's stand-out powerhouse performances and unflinching violence that, while certainly not as graphic as its reputation would have you believe, serves the dark and uncompromising story well. Dark, unflinching stuff that isn't for the faint of heart. 8/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"

PSYCHOLOGICAL HORRORPart II of Chan-wook Park's ""vengeance"" trilogy where each of the three films are unrelated to one another and can be seen without watching the other- they are only related in terms of the theme of ""vengeance""! In this second installment, from the first 20 minutes centers on a drunken man who gets himself kidnapped by an unknown assailant before he is drugged and locked in an armored room, with the only communication he has with the outside world is a television set depriving him from society for 15 years. But once he finally gets out, he swears revenge on the people or persons responsible for this, except that it's very hard for him to adjust to society again. That his abnormality once going to his first sea food restaurant after 15 years in captivity, he asks for something alive, and the lady serving him brings him a live octopus in which he stuffs it into his mouth, starts gnawing on it and is still alive upon him falling asleep! Many twists and turns, revelations happen as he increasingly becomes more obsessed about the perpetrators or perpetrator involved with every new thing he finds out- the revelations becomes much more more sickening than the last! As mentioned, the real movie doesn't start until he's been let out, or has escape and goes on a blind splurge to find out what had really happened and why with little discourse from the police who're almost non- existent this time. I thought this film was interesting since I had seen films that 're similar to this, but it only gets interesting only until after at a certain point, since as the film progresses , I started to care even less and they're shocking almost predictable after seeing the first ""Sympathy For Mr. Vengeance""! This film reminds of trapped man in""Woman in the Dunes"" without any explanation other than he is trapped, leading this movie toward a shocking ""Takashi Miike"" type of psychological story and more influenced by shock master Miike than anything.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"

Cruel and Unusual,"Cruel and unusual...Please do not mistake the above phrase as a negative review of this film. It is anything but. The movie is cruel; unforgivably, unabashedly, brilliantly cruel. Mr. Park refuses to compromise his vision in the name of our innocence and he and this film should be commended for it. All too often films, especially of the Hollywood variety, forsake artistry for commercialism, the honesty of tragedy for the fuzziness of fairy tale endings, truth for dollars. The very ""unusual""ness of this film arises from its very cruelty. It is embarking on territory rarely treaded on by conventional American films.A man is imprisoned for 15 years. He gets out. He seeks revenge. He seeks the truth. The question is not whom but why. This is the basic premise of the film. It is not a complicated plot, and many such revenge films with similar plots exist, yet somehow this film is completely and utterly on its own plane. Maybe it is in the way Mr. park sets the mood - every frame is hauntingly beautiful, not just convenient to the story but as integral as the actors themselves, illuminating the human emotions that are such a part of this film. Maybe it is in the penultimate performances of its players, so truthful and lush that if Mr. Choi were to recreate his character on a bare stage, I would still be riveted. Some have had the audacity to accuse this fine actor of over-acting. To that I say if such is the case, then all the other acting performances that i have witnessed have been woefully under-acted. Maybe it is the wonderfully hypnotic score, or the vibrant colors or engaging dialog's(lines that are as memorable as they are fitting). Whatever it may be, I am a better film fan for having seen it.Some may accuse me of exaggeration or hyperbole. Watch it for yourself. Ask yourself after you have seen it if it has not affected you in some real way, whether good or bad.The mark of a great film can often be found in the lobby of the theater, or the neighboring diner, or (perhaps more fittingly) in internet forums, where the merits of the film can spark lively debates among those who have seen the film. It's images refuse to leave the recesses of your mind, and so you ponder, argue, proclaim ideas amongst those who have had the same experience. Such is the film Old Boy. Whether this movie was to your tastes or not, you cannot deny that it leaves its mark on you.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
Cinematic Masterpiece,"Oldboy"" is a film with a simple storyline but executed exceptionally well. Every character in the movie has depth and a backstory, contributing to a richly woven narrative. The film is strikingly realistic, and every scene serves a specific purpose, enhancing the overall impact. The last 20 minutes are particularly mind-blowing, delivering unexpected twists that keep viewers on the edge of their seats.While there is a sex scene in the movie, it's essential to note that it serves a purpose in the narrative. If you are watching with your family, it's best to avoid letting children see it. Nevertheless, the film's exploration of complex themes like revenge and identity elevates it beyond conventional storytelling.The cinematography is striking, with each frame meticulously composed to enhance the mood and tension. The action sequences are intense and artistically choreographed, showcasing the film's unique style. Choi Min-sik's performance is particularly compelling, drawing viewers into the character's emotional turmoil.The haunting score complements the story's emotional weight, further enriching the viewing experience.

Gripping Revenge Thriller unlike any other,"""Revenge is futile"" is the theme of Old boy, a South Korean movie directed by Chan-Wook Park with Min-SIk Choi as the lead character of the story. It is a dark, twisted masterpiece of revenge fiction with terrifying plot twists.The story follows Oh Dae-su, as he gets imprisoned for 15 years in a room and is finally released by his captor without any explanation. We are shown the changes brought about in Oh Dae-su over the course of 15 years as he is subjected to routine doses of television, drugs, valium gas and hypnosis. He is suddenly freed after 15 years and we look at a mentally unstable man with vengeance in his heart who sets out to find his captor and kill him. The second part of the movie then follows Oh Dae-su as he tries to find his captor, meeting a beautiful girl (Mido) in the process, and learning the truth about his captivity slowly as he gets closer to his captor. The end is a series of terrifying plot-twists culminating in an intense climax scene.This movie is a piece of revenge fiction and shows us just how messy revenge can be. ""Revenge begets revenge and this is where the justice system has to step in."" This movie is a study on how horrible and twisted revenge can get and the extents to which vengeful men go to exact revenge on the people they were wronged by. The aftermath of this vengeance-filled story, as we see in the final scene, is tragedy and destruction.I personally love this movie because of the intensity maintained throughout the movie. The direction is top-notch and a few scenes stand out as highlights with brilliant acting, cinematography and compositions. The plot twists are numerous with each one more sinister than the last and keeps you horribly fascinated at the unfolding of events. The psyches of the different characters are studied in detail as their actions unfold and hurtle towards the climax.Overall, I would place this movie above other revenge fiction movies like Kill Bill, Count of Monte Cristo as this movie is darker, with more violence, more destruction and more revenge than the rest of them.

"artistic perfection vs. any values and sense - ""Oscar"" for mind-screwing hardcore....","i carefully watched this from the beginning to the credits. The first half of the film raised my expectations of masterpiece and of deep insights to the top, but the rest turned out to be a major disaster.the only thing that left me with my mouth open is the question: why? i'm not pretending to be any moralist here, but why try so hard to make a ""hardcore puke"" look so beautiful if higher goal of this ""masterpiece"" is to make ""vomit"" attractive then this is a complete success - art for the sake of art at its best.

A family thing,"Oddly having seen the Spike Lee Americanized remake first, I preferred the critically lambasted Oldboy slightly more than the Korean original. Talk about going out on a limb.Oh Dea-Su goes out drinking on his daughter's birthday and finds himself imprisoned in a room for 15 years. He is also suspected of killing his wife. He has no idea who has captured him and for what reason.15 years on he is released and given just five days to discover the identity and reason of the man who imprisoned him. Oh Dae-Su sees this as a chance of getting revenge, he has kept himself in shape while he was locked up and goes out looking for answers, he also falls in love with a young woman along the way.The film is a Gothic revenge tale with graphic violence and a nod to The Count of Monte Cristo and Oedipus Rex.It seems that Oh Dea-Su's nemesis has set up a complex and contrived form of revenge that spans years. Like Oh Dea-Su you yearn for the answers and you root for him as he beats up all-comers some literally to a pulp.However I found the ending to be messy and unnecessarily graphic and gruesome. The remake had an elegant ending which was more palatable. Also I found the lead actor hard to take as a bad ass.Josh Brolin in the remake I could buy as the rowdy student in his youth or the drunken boor as a young man. When he is released I can see him being grungy and violent as he hunts down the people who locked him up.Still Oldboy was critically lauded and regarded as a masterpiece of modern South Korean cinema and is worth a watch.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"

A guy put in jail for no reason for 15 years. He fights his demons as a crave for revenge is building.,"Great opening and build up but a disappointing end. It starts out with throwing an innocent man to jail. The end is a complex story about why he was put in jail mixed with some other weird stuff that are totally off base and it destroys this movie. The quality of the movie falls dramatically when this so called ""revenge"" takes place. Reminded me of a action video game where you get hit by all kinds off stuff but nothing ever happens, and the enemies are too easy to beat. It's pretty slow at times too (2nd half). You see long slow flashbacks and the reason for putting him to jail along with the other weird stuff are silly. The only good thing about this movie was the first half.

I expect Oldboy to age rather quickly.,"Oldboy is a film that is colourful and cinematic. It blends martial arts and action in with a plot in such a way, it's easy to just ogle at the special effects and stunts on show. Oldboy in terms of these stunts and effects is just another example of Asian film and what they do so well but this is an example that was unnecessary. Certainly, you have your 'art' films in the form of Hero and House of Flying Daggers that rely heavily on sublime aesthetical quality as well as stunts and hypnotically good music but with Oldboy, it's like it's merely 'House of Flying Daggers: for teens' and this is because it just tries to gross the audience out whilst use a lame revenge story to fill in the blanks.There can be no denying that Oldboy tries to tread filmic ground that teens will have no idea even existed and this comes in the form of voyeurism. There is a scene in which a boy sucks the breast of a girl whilst another boy secretly watches from a nook in the wall  what's interesting here is that not only is the third party's view in point of view format (meaning that it's supposed to signify us watching) but half way through, the girl pulls out a mirror just so that she can watch her own reaction to the activity being carried out.The film eventually starts out like any other revenge film  a guy is back on his feet after a stretch in a prison of some sort and goes after answers as to why he was there. The film tries to play cat and mouse with a mysterious cell phone: 'Whose calling?' and 'Why are they?' Yes, I wonder. He also manages to shack up with a female character after an encounter in a sushi bar that involves a particularly memorable scene involving an octopus that I knew nothing about until actually watching the film. This is where Oldboy begins its journey of a revenge film gone very, very wrong and I don't mean that as a negative statement, it's just that Oldboy is so audacious and over the top in its delivery of rather pointless content that when you think about it, it's difficult to get too excited.Oldboy fails to suck you in  it just doesn't create an atmosphere. Despite its ratings and 'disturbing content', I actually found the film to be rather upbeat, almost like a comedy at times. There is the humble breaking of reality when the film pauses and a dotted line showing the intended line of attack a hammer will undergo once that character swings it is funny more than anything else. There is also an emphases on 'nothing dialogue'. When two people are talking down the phone about a formal school girl from years ago who was, from their memory, 'a total slut'; I was wondering if this was meant to be funny or if it was setting up a character for later on or whatever  I was left confused more than convinced. There's also plenty of room for ancient Chinese or Japanese or maybe even Korean proverbs that characters spout to one another. This is Oldboy again trying to be something it is not.In regards to the 'gross, sensitive' content, I say ""what content?"" The guy eating the live octopus was surprising more than it was gross  I've eaten both octopus and squid before (obviously not live) but so what? The sex? Well, what about it? Try Basic Instinct or Boogie Nights or anything else of that variety. Again, it's for teens: 'Oh look, a sex scene(!)'. The 'graphic scenes of torture' involves someone having their teeth yanked out.....for about three seconds. Again, try watching work from Takeshi Miike or one of the Hostel films. Yes, Oldboy was violent what with its hammers and its snapped toothbrushes and its broken up shards of compact disc but so what? Violence is in most films these days. To conclude: Octopus scene = Surprising; Torture = Brief; Sex = Soft; Violence = Graphic so that's one out of four done to a graphic extent.Oldboy failed to impress me in ways it has others as I just know there are better films out there. It tried to be something that it wasn't yet at the same time, has some redeeming features that keep it from being an out and out 'bad' film.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"

A Brutal Game of Revenge,"This was a movie that I learned existed when I got into listening to podcasts, I heard a lot about it and this one went on my shortlist of movies to see due to that. It still took me awhile to watch it though. Something that is interesting is there is quite a bit of debate about whether this is horror or not. Before seeing this, I heard the arguments on both sides and I can see both arguments. Since horror is the only genre that I do in-depth reviews on, you can guess where I lie and I'll get into that a bit later.Synopsis: after being kidnapped and imprisoned for fifteen years, Oh Dae-su (Min-ski Choi), only to find that he must find his captor in five days.To expand on what the synopsis states, we meet our main character, Dae-su, while he's at the police station. He's drunk and causing a ruckus until his friend No Joo-hwan (Dae-han Ji) shows up to take him home. They leave and Joo-hwan uses a payphone to call his family. It is raining and we see a pair of angel wings in a paper bag. Dae-su had them on for a moment in the police station as they are a gift for his daughter. This man disappeared.Things then take a turn. Dae-su is in a room with a steel door. There is a little hatch that is opened and he pleads with his captor. Food is put through and then closed. We see Dae-su and the things that he does to stay sane. He tattoos a mark for each year he is there on his hand. He uses the television to help him keep time, the date, school at home and even church. There is a picture hanging that has the lines: 'Laugh and the world laughs with you. Cry and you cry alone'. There is also something weird where he is knocked out periodically with gas. They then cut his hair and other upkeep that they can't trust him with due the tools used. To try and stay sane, Dae-su also trains his body to fight. He uses his time to try and escape as well.There is a day where he is hypnotized and wakes up on a rooftop. I did forget to state that we started here with someone hanging over the edge, being held only by his tie while he has a dog. The person not in peril then stated he wants to tell his story. It turns out the one holding him up was Dae-su. He's now free and trying to figure out who held him captive for these 15 years.This leads him to a sushi restaurant where to meet Mi-do (Hye-jeong Kang). From what I gathered, Dae-su saw her on TV for a cooking show. She ends up taking Dae-su home with her when he passes out. She tends to his wounds and the two of them have a sexual attraction. She aids him in trying to figure out what happened to him and who was behind it. The problem is that he doesn't necessarily trust her or anyone around him. We do also keep seeing the character of Lee Woo-jin (Ji-Tae Yoo).Dae-su is told that he has 5 days to figure it out, by July 5th, before all the women in his life are killed, starting with Mi-do. While he was locked up, he heard his wife was murdered and since he was missing, he's the prime suspect. Because of everything, his daughter was adopted by a couple in Sweden. Or that is what he thinks happened with her.He ends up seeking out his friend, Joo-hwan, who now runs an internet café, to help him piece together everything that happened. It will take him back to high school and something that happened there. His pursuit of revenge though will take him to the limits and do unspeakable things.That is where I'll leave my recap and introduction to the characters. I think that I should address the elephant in the room to start my actual analysis. Is Oldboy a horror movie? It falls into that adjunct category. There are dark elements. This movie is a revenge film and that plays out in more than one way. Lee wants revenge on Dae-su and vice versa. We get action as there are wild sequences. There is also gore that comes from these. There is drama, there is mystery and this is for sure a thriller. What I have left out is if this is a horror movie.I do personally think there are elements and some of those come from what is presented to us. Dae-su is held in this 'cell' for 15 years. When he released, he is told that he is now in a much larger, different type of prison. Reflecting on this is a beautiful yet demented thing. Dae-su is so stuck on learning the truth, he's trapped. Revenge is also a terrifying thing that will cause you to lose your humanity, but that has already been stripped away by the torture of his original prison. Dae-su must come to terms with what happened to him to get his revenge. There are a couple of scenes with graphic images. That doesn't make it horror though. I do think that this falls into modern exploitation with the torture and the truth behind the sexual elements as well. The long game and the reveals are dark with our main villain being scarred and perverse. What he pushes and forces Dae-su to do is horrific.I've done it in the past, but I don't think I'm going to delve into a spoiler section. There isn't a need as I don't think my analysis needs to present what the reveals are. I've been able to flesh out the tone of the movie without it. What I like about this movie is the acting. Seeing the effects of everything that happen to Choi, I love how he plays the effects of his psychological damage. Being held in this room for 15 years without any real contact with anyone, it has some devastating repercussions. He doesn't know why for that whole time he's there. There is a smile he does multiple times that he uses to himself to put on and it goes back to the saying on the wall in his room.Yoo is the other side of what we get. The grudge he is holding and why is hard to fault him. What he does though is a bit over the top, but the effects of the event behind this has a similar effect to the ones done to Dae-su. Kang plays her role well also. Her reveal was spoiled for me, but to be honest, it didn't affect my viewing. She plays her role well and we get to see her topless. That is something I won't complain about. I'd say the rest of the cast rounded this out for what was needed as well.The last thing that I wanted to go over would be the effects. We don't get as much as I was expecting, but I'll glad they went practical. There are action sequences where Dae-su fights a group of guys. There is one that isn't perfect but was done in one take. That is impressive. We get some torture scenes that look realistic. One with the claw of a hammer and teeth that made me cringe. There's another scene that plays on this as well. The blood looks good and the cinematography is solid. I did see this is based on a comic and I could tell that before confirming. It looks like they pulled certain scenes right off a page and brought them to life. It worked for me for sure.In conclusion, I'm glad I finally ticked this off my list. This is an interesting revenge film that has a story deeper than I was expecting. For the modern era, the Koreans know how to do this sub-genre. The acting from our three stars helps to bring this to life. The practical effects work for me. This clocks in at 2 hours, but I barely noticed that. It caught my attention and I love piecing together the story as we go. Dae-su needs to remember and learn, just as we are as well. This is one I have a feeling my rating is going to go up. I can't come in with a perfect score with this first viewing, but it is a great movie for me. It held up with the second watch and seeing it in the theater was great as well.My Rating: 9.5 out of 10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
Spiritually Grotesque,"Sinning makes you a beast, but is it worth living with your sins?It's no wonder that Park Chan-wook wanted to adapt the original manga series through a more cinematic apeture.

"Technically well made, story silly and gross","The good:
the film is aesthetically shot in a unique and cool style, with some good action scenes (hammer fight was cool:). Actors are great.The bad:
the characters are flat and one-dimensional. The story is totally silly and unrealistic (e.g. stereotype crazy bad guy spends what must be millions of dollars and years of detailled planning to get revenge... drunk guy learns being kunfgu master from watching tv... people hypnotized.. these things would be cool in an Austin Powers slapstick comedy movie, but here..??!). As a result, any attempt to convey the serious themes tackled (revenge, incest etc) fails from the absurdity and lack of realism of the story. On top comes gory and partly disgusting violence, which doesn't really support the plot (but probably shocking stuff sells to some more primitive target audiences?).
As time passes and the film drags on, the story becomes increasingly tedious and boring to follow, finally putting viewers out of their misery in a fittingly absurd finale.All in all: great craftsmanship but awful story = waste of time; can't really recommend it to anyone.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"

A mess,"OK, perhaps there is truth in the saying ""lost in translation"" because I absolutely do not understand why this movie has garnered the praise it has. It is a mess, an absolute mess from beginning to end. The only positive thing I can say about it is the wickedly twisted revenge plot. There is no cohesive story line, no attempt to give the viewer any kind of clue about what is going on. You are kept in the dark the whole time, which I assume is the point. But by the time the final credits roll, you want to borrow one of the hammers used in the movie and beat yourself over the head with it to stop the pain that the film inflicts on your senses from trying to make any kind of sense of it.I have since gone back and watched this film again without the dubbed soundtrack and though I still feel it is way over hyped, I do not feel it is as bad as my initial review of it above.

Absolutely stunning,"Chan-wook Park had a vision. A vision that this film would pull on all the senses. The disgust of taboo, the despair of loneliness, the hilarity of tradgedy. Oldboy mixes a bit of Tarantino with a lot of Kubrick in a thriller that does almost everything right.The writing is fantastic. It is visionary and spacious. It is artistic and playful. It is definitely not a 'realistic' film. Although the pace is whiplash inducing, the film always manages to get across its point. It is cold, then it is warm. It is utterly tragic and then it is hilarious. The cinematography is innovative and memorable. The action sequences are unbelievably fun to watch. The choreography was simply beautiful.It's hard to describe a film like this which I feel has certain...problems but somehow it would not be doing the film justice to give it less than the highest praise that I can award it. I believe this can be a timeless film that all aspiring art film producers must watch and learn from for time in perpetuum.

""Oldboy"" was at the top because I've heard that Tarantino liked it and it was one of the most critically acclaimed films of the 2000's. After watching this film, I was in a trance. The story is based on a graphic Japanese manga. It follows a man who gets kidnapped and incarcerated by mysterious forces, spending 15 years. Through means which I can't describe in words due to the graphic nature, the man comes back to real world but is given a limit by his mysterious captor to find out the reason of his incarceration.

A Thrilling Journey of Mystery and Emotion with Stunning Performances,"Oldboy is a South Korean neo-noir psychological thriller that was released in 2003. The film follows the story of Oh Dae-su, who is mysteriously kidnapped and imprisoned in a hotel room for 15 years. Upon his release, he sets out on a quest to find his captor and uncover the reason behind his imprisonment.The main actor, Min-sik Choi, delivered an outstanding performance as Oh Dae-su. He effectively conveyed the character's emotions, which range from rage to desperation, and his transformation throughout the film was truly remarkable. His acting was a major highlight of the movie, making it an intense and captivating viewing experience.The film also features an intriguing storyline, which keeps the audience on edge until the very end.

Best film at Cannes?  Please explain.,"I just saw this at the Philly film festival and I was amazed at how so many people were conned into thinking this was such a great movie. While sitting on the steps before the movie started (all seats were sold out at that point) I heard such a buzz: ""...best Korean film of all time... won best picture at Cannes... ending will blow you away..."". In fact the guy who introduced OLDBOY said to the anxious crowd before the lights went dark that ""OLDBOY may be the greatest movie ever made"". I must admit I almost fell for it too. It looks beautiful and the director is nothing if not innovative and technically brilliant. However the praise goes only as deep as the razor thin plot line. To say this movie is contrived is a drastic understatement. I don't want to give anything away (why? I'm not quite sure) but lets just say this: the ridiculous ending to Park's OLDBOY is on par with the likes of Shamalan's SIGNS and whoever the moron was who directed last year's abysmal SAW. Now if you were amazed by the ludicrous 11th hour revelations in those movies (although SIGNS at least was pretty good up to that point) then you probably won't feel utterly cheated and let down by OLDBOY. I found myself saying ""good God they can't be serious!"". I can't really trash the movie for too many other reasons other than the weak story and atrocious ending. Everything else was pretty good, not #92 of all time and Cannes darling good, but decent and enjoyable. I actually cared about the characters which almost never happens in movies today, and the blood and violence which others have complained about I thought was a strong point. But the story! Come on already. I'm in awe that Quentin Tarantino, who can spin a story like no other, bought into OLDBOY. Another prime example of writers managing to stink up a great premise. One more thing, Park's earlier film SYMPATHY FOR MR. VENGEANCE, while also no masterpiece, was far, far superior to OLDBOY in my opinion. Worth watching.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
Oldeuboi is a classic of both Korean cinema and all Asian cinema,"Oldeuboi is a classic of both Korean cinema and all Asian cinema. An example of a movie that has not aged in more than 20 years. It's still relevant. Moderately cruel, with a well-built plot that does not subside for 2 hours. With an excellent open ending and a plot twist that works. Oldeuboi tells a rather simple story, visually the film is not able to surprise much, the budget is 3 million dollars. The question arises, how can Oldeuboi surprise? And the fact that this is literally one of the best revenge movies. Watching this movie, you get the feeling that you are watching ""Kill Bill"" by Tarantino, they are very similar in their meaning of revenge.

Stylistically brilliant but way too unbelievable,"I know, I know: it's a movie, I'm supposed to suspend my disbelief etc. But even so, I just couldn't buy the ending of this movie.The story is very good, though, and the plot twists are believable and work well (up until the end). I also loved the contemporary film noir style of this film. Lots of deep, scarlet reds, purples and black illuminated under fluorescent lighting or stark, low-watt bulbs.An abridged telling of the story would tell you that this is a film about one man's revenge and penance. Dae-su Oh, a notorious drunk, is imprisoned in a nondescript hotel room for 15 years, without being told who imprisoned him or why. After he manages to escape, he finds that things are eerily set-up to ease him back into life on the outside - a homeless man gives him a cell phone and a wallet filled with cash, a young sushi waitress appears to take a shine to him, after passing out in the street, he's immediately picked up and rescued by a stranger.It would be unfair to give out any other information, since the first two-thirds of this film are deeply satisfying on an intellectual and a sensory level. It's a rich experience and, even with all the blood and grit, there's a sophisticated neatness to each frame. The direction is sublime and I think you could pause any shot and marvel at how gorgeous this film looks. The soundtrack and visuals, together, make for a stunning experience and the performance by Min-sik Choi needs to be seen to be believed.But then, you get to the last part of the film. The finale, the moment where all will be revealed, and Dae-su is vindicated. And... it all falls a bit flat. IMO. Sure there's a decent twist but I wasn't buying the depths of madness these characters would go to to achieve ""revenge"". The end seemed a tad illogical and it felt like a cop out, as if the writers couldn't come up with a more realistic scenario.I read somewhere that's it's based on a Manga, so maybe that's why it's so twisted and maybe the ending makes more sense in a comic book but I wasn't convinced.I would recommend checking this out, if only because it grips you from the start and because it offers such a rich visual and auditory experience. In the end, though, you might be disappointed.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"

What a ride...,"This is probably the movie that brought me into Asian cinema. I had seen a few films of Kurosawa or John Woo before, but I never took a look further into it. Oldboy changed that completely. Oh Dae-su is kidnapped on his daughter's birthday and then held captive for 15 years. He than one day wakes up on top of a skyscraper, at the exact same spot he was captured. Now he is looking for the reason of his captivity and he wants revengeI first heard about this movie from other critics calling it one of the best movies of its year or something along those lines. So I rented it and was absolutely stunned. The cinematography is so beautiful yet gruesome, it's full of pictures that will stay in your head days after watching it. Might it be one of the memorable fight scenes or the breath-taking finale. The story is very simple in its premise, but develops very well and takes a few unexpected turns. A guy looking for revenge sounds very familiar and not original at all, but what Park Chan-wook does with it, is something no one else could have done the same way. In my opinion he might very well be one of the best directors of the last decade and this shows exactly why. Choi Min-sik and Yu Ji-tae do an amazing job playing their respective roles. The often very unusual scenes aren't easy to play, but the two pull it off pretty good. The other actors do a decent job as well. The soundtrack is just great and has a style close to romantic composer Edvard Grieg. The songs fit perfectly to the scenes and underline the tragic tone of the movie.I think this is one of the best movies of the 2000's. It has a great story, solid actors and a magnificent score.

Get past the first 45 minutes and the reward will be a great last act,"After looking back at it, it had; amazing acting, good symbolism and great plot-twists. Unfortunately, the first 30 minutes are almost unbearable, as only the movie description here on IMDb actually gives any hint as to how the story is going to progress and everything up until that point in the movie have been obnoxious and pretentious. However, once the story actually kicks into gear, some 15 minutes later, the movie becomes decent. There are plenty of cases of good cinematography, while the dialogue is a mix of philosophical quotes or important exposition. There is also a noticeable shift from the pretentious first part, to an action sequence, montage sequence, flashback sequence and finally a dramatic sequence. This shift was disorienting as to what the tone of the movie was intended to be. The later act is definitely the high point and is executed well, but is impossible to predict as it is mostly based on newly given information and does not make up for the previous runtime.Unfortunately, the story heavily relies on the exclusive compelling objective of the main protagonist, and while that had a great conclusion, it was not that compelling on its own - as pointed out by the side-kick. Sure, there is a time limit, but there are no other hurdles in the ""mastered martial arts via the TV""-protagonist's way to make it suspenseful up until the very end...",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
proving that style and sizzle does not a movie make,"A movie without ideas or theme that is long on cinematic style (but then, so are MTV videos and most successful commercials) and short on recognizable human interest (unless you are a first-world adolescent, in which case you will idolize its sadomasochistic cool and eye candy, not to mention the fact that its emotional center appears to be high school). Let's not even talk about artistic merit. Quentin Tarantino (maker of one, perhaps two great movies and a couple of good entertainments) is the most obvious salesman for the view that pulp junk, polished up and translated by cinematic trickery and fascinated with its own pop cultural hipness, is valuable (and Tarantino was on the committee at Cannes that gave this film the Grand Jury Prize). Park steals here from some of the greats (film noir specialists like Hitchcock, absurdists like Bunuel, masters of cinema cool like Kubrick), but lacks any feeling for what made *their* movies worth seeing. Put simply, it lacks wit (unless by wit you only mean slapstick), and its ideas are like bad homilies no one understands. I keep encountering this in the newer Japanese and Korean and Hong Kong cinema that seems influenced by Tarantino: comic book themes and characters pass through high-polish celluloid/digital trickery and a ironic pop filter (all borrowed).

It's the most incredibly thought-out piece of cinema that I have ever seen. We are shown the right amount of each character to discover their emotions and ultimately who they are without having it spoonfed to us. It's not in your face, it doesn't insult the viewer like that. Everything you see and everything you know about the movie whilst watching it is what you need to know. The violence in this movie is used sparingly and yet feels so real. The hallway fight is where we really feel that we want Oh Dae Su to succeed and the music, setting,characters and buildup are the reason why. But it's clear when the fighting is pointless and at these times it is not present.

Violence isn't just skin deep,"OldboyAt it's heart there lies a story of lost innocence and revenge. In this journey, director Chan-wook Park, travels a road where we question what lies after the righting of a supposed wrong, and the price that man will go to in order to maintain a sense of not knowing.As has become the tradition with much reporting of graphic Southeast and East Asian cinema, a focus on violence and vivid imaginary overshadows the intricacies of narrative development. Of course it doesn't hold an eighteen rating for no reason, but for a moment lets forget some of the comic-book violence in which it excels.Our story focuses on the 15-year imprisonment of Dae-su Oh (the man who gets along with others),confined to a dwelling that has all the apparent comforts of a modern South Korean apartment, but with the added bonus of piped hallucinogenic drugs making our protagonist more susceptible to hypnotic suggestion. Like our prisoner, for much of the film's duration we are limited to understanding why this event has taken place. In the meantime we are invited to embrace both the intentional and unintentional comic and tragic moments that follow as the ticking years wind the tension of retribution as we go from supposed breakout to the incidences of assumed chance meetings. Where true understanding of our journey is confined and complex questions asked in the last twenty minutes of the film, we are treated to flashes of inspirational camera work and effects, which do not in any way detract from the sense of this film. It would be easy to dismiss the violence as over the top, but as Dae-su Oh asks, does fifteen years of imagery training prepare one for the battles that will ensue. Along that way we are treated to a familiarity of claw hammer and human skull, which will have you both wincing and smirking at the same time. Fistfights that will make you take sharp intakes of breath as bone smacks bone in a not altogether unbelievable way.Although not gripping from beginning to end, you do want to find out the reason for such a complex game of cat and mouse, which in essence is what the plot revolves around. Where it is easily possible to miss some of the bigger questions this film asks, if your able to maintain your interest and look beyond the surface violence, days later you can still find yourself asking what price you would be prepared to pay in order to forget or not know, and whether holding onto grudges of the past are really worth expending all that energy.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
Keeping it in the family,"The family does seem to be a focus in Asian cinema, and this is no exception. Being imprisoned in a room for 15 years for no immediate reason is a very good start to an exceptional film. But the closeness of the interiors does not seem to stop once our hero is released to get his revenge.The violence in the film while never meaningless does seem to weave a strong unpleasant backbone that gives the film its vivid consistency. But its not a logic - its never an and in itself. While there is a lot borrowed from the modern stylised thriller, which always involves some sort of identity problem, e.g. Seven, Fight club, Momento etc, the film is much more than the sum of its parts. The director has a sense of timing that can only come about from the strength of the written material.But ultimately this is still Asian cinema, with Asian values, yet its fighting for Western cinema audiences.

Pretentious piece of fail,"When one of my friends recommended this to me, raving about how well it was filmed, the underlying themes and the general greatness of the film, I obviously expected an amazing, at least entertaining film.The two hours I spent watching this turned out to be a huge disappointing waste of my time.I understand that this movie is meant to be surreal, but even in surreal movies, there is something which anchors it down, even if it is only in the slightest. This movie, on the other hand, felt forced and fake. A lot of the shots were unnecessary and watching it made me think the director was trying to hard to be artistic.The acting was poor, and the relationships between characters were not nearly developed enough. Maybe that's just me missing something that others could see but I hadn't even realised there was any sort of attraction between Dae su and Migo before they started getting at it like rabbits randomly half way through the film. Then again, maybe this film was just bad.I am not against violence in movies, but in this one, almost all of it was just unnecessary. Throughout all the fight scenes I felt myself cringing at how painfully cliché it all was.And the plot? The word laughable comes to mind. I would be amused if I hadn't wasted two hours of my life following this poorly thought out and ridiculous plot. Despite all the movie's flaws, by the end of it, I was expecting something interesting to conclude it. I won't discuss the ending, because I wouldn't want to ""spoil"" the movie for those who haven't seen it. Just that the metaphor ""Be it a rock or a grain of sand, in water they sink as the same."" cannot be used as an explanation for everything.This entire movie was made for shock value and shock value only.

Well that was different...,"You may need to be a right kind of person (or perhaps a wrong kind of person) to watch it. It is not going to be for everyone's tastes, which is all the more surprising considering just how well it has been received.The scenes in this movie catch you off guard, with your mental pants down. You think you are about to see something but then it surprises you ahead of time with a close up of something else. And there you sit, with your mouth open wondering what the next scene may bring next or what other camera angle they will invent. Just remember to breath in between the scenes.You may have seen graphic movies before, movies that use a lot of gore and yelling. If those movies are like a big electric chainsaw, then Oldboy is more like a scalpel or needle piercing the skin.Having said that, Oldboy tries a bit too hard. It becomes obvious that it tries to shock you with a new image, thought or a sick twist. It goes a bit over the top in certain parts, breaking a serious and realistic tone with a cartoony comical style, which is not surprising considering its manga roots. It can be either really jarring or really interesting and refreshing, depending on your taste.Where the movie lost me was at the big reveal in the end. The twist and its tragedy are contrived, immature and unrealistic. These kinds of story points occur more often in Japanese anime.The music was very interesting and noticeable. There is a fight scene with a minimalistic track of a lonely trumpet and beats. And it totally works, making a scenes take on a wholly different tone than you would expect. A neo-classical melancholy is piercing everything. My only issue is that the soundtrack adds to the over-the-top drama in certain scenes.If you can stomach its style, Oldboy is a movie that needs to be seen at least once in a lifetime. It was a mind-bending experience and not something I have seen before.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"

I rented it and now I won't be speaking to him again. I can make a movie better than this. How hard is it to get some fake blood and lame dialogue together and pay off a director to say he liked it at canne? A small note, Just because Quentin Tarentino says it's good does not make it so.

The perfect movie exists. It's called Oldboy.,"Normally i am very careful, when it comes to topics like this. But Oldboy just blew me away.

Cinematography, editing, performances, character writing or just the brilliant twisted story are absolutly unique. By the way, the thematics and symbolisms of this movie are also highly recommended to any hobby-philosophers. The way how Chan-Wook Park handled the back story of the movie's antagonist, is not only relatable, but also kind of daring. You see his point, although you do not agree with his actions. Oh Dae Sue on the other hand, is a great protagonist. He's got a simple motivation, and is marked by 20 years of isolation, but also possesses some emotional spots and is more vulnerable than ever. The movie has a message and doesn't only rely on it's astounding directing. There a many visual metaphors and it touches on many social-critically questions.

"Sufficiently Dark and Disturbing, Though Not Always Purposeful","A Korean action-suspense flick that, like many far-east thrillers, doesn't hesitate to take things well into the realm of the taboo. In a lot of ways that's a blast of fresh air, as no doubt an American version wouldn't have been half as biting, daring or dark, and its dedication to probing the unacceptable makes up a large part of Oldboy's character. It's not those stabs outside the boundaries that bothered me about this one, though, so much as it was the refusal to bask in them for more than a few instants before jolting off in search of new depths. The establishing story is almost perfect, setting the stage with an everyman who's been transformed by fifteen years of unexplained imprisonment, then following his violent, dedicated search for both suspect and reason. It's an act the tangled, overstretched follow-through can't hope to match, even when its mysteries and motivations are finally, confusingly, lain bare. Oldboy deserves recognition for its style, demeanor and intense action scenes, but the plot often veers into weirdness and depravity for unclear reasons that don't always benefit the bigger picture.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"

Film without Mercy,"What is so fascinating about Asian cinema is its radicalism and the extremes. Not only the action and the depicting representation of violence are so radical, but also when it comes to aesthetic issues that exceed the lines of occidental films. Such as ""Oldboy"" does. An attack in philosophical and aesthetic aspects: brutal, disturbing, traumatic - and beautiful. The Jury of the Cannes festival under the lead of Tarantino could not do differently than present the Grand Prix to the work of director Park Chan-wook.""Oldboy"" is the second feature film of Park's 'Vengeance-Trilogy' which started with ""Boksuneun naui geot - Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance"" in 2002. The story is based on a Japanese manga book series. Park tells it in breathtaking, disturbing pictures which reflect the state of consciousness of the protagonist: In moments of emotional safety coined in aerated colors, in moments of revenge left cold and grey. A surreal atmosphere, a fragmentarily way of narrating, and a hardly decoded use of symbolism leaves the viewer without control over the reception of what he is witnessing. Instead he gets into the vortex of extremely emotions where there is actually no way out. Ungovernable anger, distress, fear, love, and pain collide with harsh cuts. The film transfers that chaos to the viewing audience brilliantly. That's what we like about Asian cinema in particular the films of Kitano, Kim, and Miike: The fathom of emotional and aesthetic extremes.""Oldboy"" is not a birth product of the brain. In nearly every shot there is something surprising, every dialog develops a plot-twist and in every character lies a fascinating secret. Enough material that leaves us thinking about the whole point and rearrange the emotional chaos in our heads, even after days and days.",,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"

The tyranny of plot over character.,"This film has no soul. Thats my main problem with the film really. It has no soul. Sure the film looks fantastic, sure it supposedly deals with the often popular and heady subject of revenge in a brash, bold way but it does it in a way that is needlessly gratuitous and wholly sensational. The long, side-scrolling fight scene which is very striking and original is entirely unnecessary and drawn out. A clear cut case of style over substance, which is apparent throughout most of this film. And it suffers heavily from a certain style of writing that seems to be symptomatic of substandard east Asian filmmakers. The idea that drama and powerful film-making are the result of a cumulative effect. That is, if you add enough elements that are recognisably powerful and dramatic, you will end up with a powerful, dramatic film. For example, suicide is very striking and powerful, revenge is dramatic, unrequited love is dramatic, a character unable of feeling human emotions is a powerful statement. The problem is that this film amongst other Asian films (eg. hero, Samaritan girl) tries to imitate truly powerful films, without an understanding of what made those films powerful in the first place, thus creating a dramatic atmosphere by carelessly throwing all these features together without the slightest care for how it effects the characters that it subjects these ""dramatic"" events to. What you are left with are alien characters, that no human being can possibly relate to or comprehend, that have no soul of their own, but are merely devices, allegories and playthings of the sensational directors that use them. In short what you have here, in this highly praised and touted film is the tyranny of plot over character and ultimately the death of character.",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
Oldboy or revenge campaign to infinity,"In the late '80s, Oh Dae-soo, the utterly average father of the family, was abducted from his own house and held for years in a private cell where the only connection to the outside world was for him to be a television. This is how he learns that his wife has been killed and the police suspect him. His pointless and incomprehensible detention reaches a determined inner revenge after initial despair. He is released 15 years later, without any explanation. This basic story could be, done badly full of clichés, or it could be the way Park Chan-wook staged this revenge movie going on indefinitely. The main concept is based on trust. The protagonist Oh Dae-soo doesn't know who to trust and who will help someone who has been detained for 15 years for his own entertainment. The amount of gore and violence the director brought to the screen was never so faithfully shown. All nudity, all tooth extractions, self-tattoos, injuries, are all portrayed realistically.
Min sik-choi fantastically brings the desperate average man who, in the midst of all ordeals, is trying to survive and take revenge.

Laugh and the World Laughs With You. Weep and You Weep Alone.,"One of the most visually impressive films of the 2000's with meticulously craft directing from Chan-Woo Park. But also easily one of the most devastating films you'll see. It rips your heart out in more ways than one.A revenge tale is only as good as the characters are written, and this film is brilliantly adapted from the 90's comic. The characters, who were apparently not developed enough in the comic, are well established within the first 20 minutes. All characters are brought around nicely by the time the credits roll, which contributes to the devastation of the film's emotional gut punch towards the end.One of the main reasons the characters work so nicely, is that Park provides character development in more ways than one. Whether it be through an important close up on our lead character's face or even a well-timed artistic metaphor, the story is so well-realized through its characters. Being that it's a tragic story that turns into a revenge flick but then turns back into a tragic tale again, you need to believe both sides of the coin. Min-sik Choi and Ji-tae Yu do a tremendous job at rounding out motivations as Dae-su and Woo-jin respectively.In order to feel the full impact of emotion Park was going for, you have to be with the film every step of the way. Although there are some plot points that blur the lines of being plot holes, Park gives us at least an acceptable answer to keep us engaged. Even just looking at the thrilling action sequences, which can be over-the-top and 'Raid'- like at times, is acceptable after seeing the finished product.Oldboy is a modern day classic. Not necessarily the type of film I would want to revisit more than once, but I got the full emotional impact that I had hoped for.

Lost in Translation or See it Again?,"""Old Boy"" is a damned tough movie to review. Its strengths and its weaknesses seem to become apparent only upon reflection. The disjointed plot is distracting and can lead viewers to lose interest in precisely what is going on. But pay close attention to this one; the pay-off is worth it.The film's greatest weakness involves poor pacing, slowing to the point of boredom at times before throwing mountains of information at the viewer in a few seconds. But Park Chan Wook is a masterful director on the cutting edge of the new wave of Asian film-making with many important titles to his credit. So perhaps this ""weakness"" is intentional.""Old Boy"" employs extraordinary cinematography, one of Park's trademarks. When dialogue and plot drag, unique camera angles and unusual presentation keep one's attention. The film starts with great promise. The protagonist, Oh Dae Su, is well-defined and supremely well portrayed by Choi Min Sik. As a viewer, I was compelled to want to go along with Oh Dae Su on his bizarre journey. Its bits of satirical humor generate particular enjoyment. The early escape scenes are superbly presented; I cried out in delight.Sadly, after the escape, the movie begins to lag. While I was expecting more in the area of Oh Dae Su's revenge (characters utter his name as if it's a horrible invocation), the story instead dives deeply into an uncertain psychological exploration that eventually loses me.I guess I could say that I just didn't get it and I'm an idiot. But the film IS sophisticated enough to be difficult to tackle. It is quite slick, its performances excellent, its presentation powerful. I just wish I could have followed the complexity of the story as it gained momentum and that the film would not have fallen into near sleep mode at too many important junctures.In all, the film is a special treat despite its drawbacks. I would venture to say that Korean cinema, and Park in particular, has reached a point similar to that of 20th century Scandinavian, Polish and French cinema in its penchant for decidedly dark (film noir) approaches. ""To hell with any concern that the audience might not be able to follow the story; just do the film."" In this respect, ""Old Boy"" succeeds supremely, although I don't find it as subtly beautiful as, say, ""Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter and Spring."" I suspect Park had that film in mind when he made this film. Similarities in style, such as vast understatement, abound.""Old Boy"" is original, daring, bizarre and purposefully entertaining. I believe only that the screenplay could have been improved; I will also concede that some vital components may have been ""lost in translation.""",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"

Best Film Of The Year,"Oldboy has to be on of the greatest revenge films ever. If not one of the best films ever.Min-sik Choi is mind blowing as Dae-su Oh, the drunkard who is imprisoned for reasons unknown for over a decade. The film has many influences, The Count of Monte Cristo being the most obvious.Just when you thought the revenge flick was old hat, along comes an awesome shock fest like Oldboy jammed with dark humor, action, and some of the best fight scenes in recent memory.Many people rave about the one take fight scene where Min-sik takes on a whole gang single handedly. It's an amazing fight. And one the viewer is exhausted after watching in a way. Dae-su starts off fighting the gang frantically, claw hammer in hand, he falls to the ground, you think he's beaten, exhausted, but he comes back fighting, he falls down again, seemingly he MUST be beaten this time. But no! He fights back and when it's all over it's amazing to see he's defeated and worn down the entire gang. And all of this shot in ONE TAKE! Incredible.There are plenty of small moments in the film that are excellent as well. One of mine being the voice over line where the hero wonders if fifteen years of pretend training can work, the short ensuing fight scene has a great, hand held kinetic energy to it. It's a mini-film school for directors on how to properly do a bad ass movie fight. And the hammer and teeth scenes are some of the most intense tooth torture scenes since the movie Marathon Man.This is one of the best movies I've ever scene, with a twisting, turning plot that is totally off the wall and fresh and unpredictable.

Oldboy wasn't exceptionally good, the plot had many holes, and the acting was so-so, except by the main character, Dae-su Oh, played by Min-sik Choi. I guess what did Oldboy in was that there wasn't that much suspense. It doesn't bring you in to want to see who the main character is imprisoned by, or why the he is imprisoned, it instead just shows an angry guy wondering the streets of Korea (with a girl of course), killing people and asking lots of questions. The answers to the questions are slowly revealed, and the by the end everything comes crashing down and you know everything.

It's unlike anything else which also makes it hard to explain why it works out so well all.I also liked the fact that the director mixed in lots of humor even with all the over the top violence and that shocking twist at the end.It's Asian, so you know that 90% of the time you are going to get something weird. Weird sounds perhaps a bit disrespectful but I mean this is a compliment really, since this often means you're getting something unusual, unexpected, unique and I just absolutely love it most of the time.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"

it's recommend go and watch this y'all,"""Oldboy"" is a South Korean classic directed by Park Chan-wook, and it's not your typical thriller. The story follows Oh Dae-su, a man who is suddenly imprisoned in a room for 15 years without knowing why. When he's finally released, he's given five days to find his captor and uncover the truth. This movie is brutal, mysterious, and full of jaw-dropping twists that make you question everything you've seen.The action scenes are raw and intense, especially the infamous hallway fight scene. But beyond the violence, the plot is incredibly deep, exploring themes of revenge, guilt, and fate. The way the story unfolds is nothing short of masterful, with every piece of the puzzle falling into place in a way you wouldn't expect. It's one of those films that stays with you long after it ends because of how shocking and thought-provoking it is.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"

Manga comics do not a good film make,"Oldboy has a wonderful setup for a revenge film, it is on par with the Count of Monte Cristo. While the main character was imprisoned I was transfixed. Who was doing this too him? Why? I was ready to be shown a good revenge film. What I got was a convoluted mess.I loved the first half of the film. Once the main character was released from a suitcase, wearing a particularly cool suit, I was fully expecting a tale of violence and revenge. Justified revenge. I knew they would throw somethings at me, but I wasn't expecting gibberish.This is the second Asian film this year that screwed up a wonderful set-up, the other being Infernal Affairs. For the whole last hour the viewer is bombarded with illogical plot devices, twists that have no real meaning either to plot or as a parable to the viewer, all stables of Manga, that do not translate well to film. Asian cinema does not like to paint characters with the sides of good and bad. The heroes are sometimes worse than the villains, they usually have something seriously wrong with them, either mentally or morally.Many of the criticisms regarding this film come from viewers who are blinded by the conventions of Western Cinema. I was not expecting it to be a conventional film, where revenge is reaped with no sacrifice to the protagonist. I was expecting destruction and madness. The conclusion however is neither of those. I don't know what it is, it just is what it is. It cannot be satisfying to anybody, even to those expecting a un-satisfying conclusion.",3.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"Good movie, not as hard to watch as I thought","I was hesitant to watch this because of the reviews warning about torture. What I found was a director who, just as in the golden age of cinema, leaves graphics to the imagination. Most movies today go so completely into graphic sex and violence that there is nothing left to the imagination. This movie was very intense, but in no way as gross and sick as many I've seen in modern times.The story is good, and like many martial arts movies where you know the hero can't possibly take on that many villains at a time, but he does anyway, you suspend reality and just go with the story. The director lets us use our own imagination and fantasy.After 15 years, who is better off? That's the moral of this revenge tale.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"

Also, the scene where the past at presence were shot at the same time (at the school) was truly a work of art. Throughout the whole movie (as a cinematography fan), I was amazed by the shots and angles of the cinematographer.Some say there are many unrealistic or extremist parts, yet if you see the whole picture the movie is amazing.

My God...,"Oldboy is without a doubt the best film I have had the pleasure to have viewed this year, Chan Wook-Park, who remains my favorite director working today has proved himself once again, if not exceeding everything that was expected of this movie.Based on a very popular Manga, Oldboy was always set to be controversial. Anyone lucky enough to have read the Manga will not have been as shocked/revolted as many of us lucky/unlucky viewers!Choi Min-Sik proved once again the level of his greatness, out doing all his previous work on such modern day classics as ""Happy End"" and ""Failan""... he is clearly in a league of his own, comparable only to that of Kong Sang-Ho!The final plot twist is as much unexpected as it devastating, and has left different reactions to each person I have showed it to. My girlfriend just cover her face and whimpered ""Oh my God..."", while my cousin just sat there in silence with his eyes closed... all the way to my uncle who just let out a nervous chuckle. This movie is really one of a kind that will go down in history as the greatest revenge movie ever constructed, unless Chan Wook-Park can pull out something very really special for Sympathy for Mrs. Vengeance... which I doubt he will be able too, best of luck to him though as I'm sure he will not let us down.",,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"

Truly amazing,"OLDBOY is the second installment in Park Chan-wook's 'Vengeance' trilogy.Oh Dae Su (Choi Min-sik) is a normal guy who lives a normal life with a wife and kid. One night when he gets caught drunk and disorderly, he's kidnapped and imprisoned in a room and is only able to communicate with the outside world by watching the TV that's in his room. One year passes by and still trapped in his room he turns on the TV and watches the news and finds out that his wife has been murdered, making Oh's rage grow and grow. Fourteen years later, he's released and starts to seek for revenge to find the person who stole Oh's fifteen years and murdered his wife.

But there is one rule in Oh's quest for revenge; the rule is he is only given five days to find his captor and his wife's murderer or else Mido will die.OLDBOY is an absolute classic tale of the obsession for vengeance and Park Chan-wook has done an incredible job, but it's unfortunate that he didn't get the Palme d'Or at Cannes but at least he got the Grand Prix Prize.

Ad Nauseam,"Oldboy is a Korean film, so it has the Hong Kong feel, but there's something different to it as well. There is a feel of film noir, but it's also got quirky humor and the obligatory kung fu scenes (although not extended). The story begins with the protagonist being abducted and imprisoned for 15 years. When he gets out, he must follow the clues to find out why he was there. Things get really weird and really twisted.What I thought about it: I really can't say anything about the over-dubbing that was sub-par because it's to be expected from foreign films. Of course when I turned on the subtitles, it didn't match the dialog - it seems as if the subtitles was a direct translation and the dubbing was a cultural equivalent with artistic freedom. It distracted me, so I turned it off. The acting might have been believable in Korean, but without actually hearing the actors' voices it was laughably bad - like some of the people you see on American Idol who put too much into their singing where it sounds ridiculous and not natural at all. The dialog and soliloquy were filled with pop-culture hackery. ""Laugh and the world laughs with you..."" and other stolen lines repeated ad nauseam trying to fill the story with philosophy, yet ultimately adding nothing to the story artistically or dramatically. Of course the twists, turns and revelations are all pretty original, yet it ends with the dreaded deus ex machina.In conclusion, this isn't a movie I'd necessarily recommend to anyone unless you're interested in foreign films, Korean camp, or if you like movies that take you one way to throw you another when it all fits together.",3.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
Oldboy is a Masterpiece.,"I first saw the trailer of the movie, and it sure looked good. I'm a big fan of oriental Action movies. Oldboy received good reviews, so i rented it out. It has a brilliant unique storyline, with a disturbing and shocking twist and ending. The movie is about a man that gets mysteriously kidnapped and finds himself in a room locked. Not a prison, just a room, with a bed and TV and he receives food. The days turns into years, and after 15 years he is suddenly released. He is given a phone and message on not Why did this happen to him, but Why was he released. Sounds a little daft, but for those who have seen this movie, if you think about it, it makes sense. It is absolutely bizarre and not for the weak hearted. Oldboy had some magnificent violence that was recorded excellent. There is a fight scene, where he takes on 15 guys on his own in a hallway. The 2 minute fight scene was recorded in one camera take, and looks brilliant. Great performances, I still recommend this movie to anyone looking for a challenge.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
A thoroughly awesome movie,"Stylish, violent, haunting Oldboy is not so much a movie as one of the most harrowing cinematic experiences you can go through, brutal yet cool.

The mysticism along with the dark side of human nature bind together so as to hypnotize and beguile the audience. The action scenes are brutal and realistic, the kind that can actually happen. The dialouge is well written, the story well paced and the direction is excellent.

giving Tatantino a run for his money,"Amazing film. I visited Korea for the first time this year. As the country, Korean films are different from what you have seen and what you have experienced from a Western perspective. This movie has a subject that starts like a Kafka story of an individual facing an unknown repressive machine, but turns quickly in a sordid and personal revenge run that would be worth of the hand of Tarantino. I am sorry to use Western cultural references, but this is the best way to describe my impressions. There is actually much more deepness, a troubling, shocking but yet so human story beyond the action story line. There are tons of graphic violence and some sex, but they did not seem shocking to me because they were very much in the logic of the story. Acting is superb, and the story line, including the ending is perfectly logic. I am hearing that Hollywood intents to do a re-make and I fear the results. But maybe they can convince Tarantino himself to do it! One of the best films of the year to end, 9 out of 10 on my personal scale.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
Unconventional Love Story,"The love story, it seems, will continue to be told as long as we can tell it and in as many ways as we want. This is why OLDBOY is so refreshing; it takes liberty with as many cinematic elements it can hold from across the spectrum of action, drama and comedy without presenting another typified movie. Conservatives beware, your social mores are not taken into consideration here (nor should they). What really got my attention were the impressively long shots that intensified the action on screen by being in real time; no quick cut cheats here. Without giving away the plot (because I really hate when someone can't tell me about a movie without giving me a synopsis of the thing), OLDBOY is quite simply one of those contemporary movies that puts almost everything I've seen to shame. Imagine America's best movie-making innovators and take away the restrictions that our tight-ass MPAA place on them...you would get films like these; actual pieces of art.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
The 2nd greatest film of all time.,"What is it, where is it, how will it affect me? After being kidnapped and imprisoned for 15 years, a man is released, only to find that he must find his captor in 5 days. Number 2 sees a controversial choice: a film that has in fact been passionately set on fire with denouncement by a number of critics. Nonetheless, what I find in Oldboy is comfort of a strange kind. What Park Chan-wook creates in his twisted and surreal world is an untouchable empathetic consistency. The protagonist, named Oh Dae-su (Min Sik-choi), is quite frankly the most three dimensional, intriguing, inspiring and hard-hitting character ever to grace the screen. His conduct is real yet fantastic, defiant yet compassionate. Aside from Oh Dae-su's remarkable and unmatchable persona, sweetly showcased by his narration of the taxonomy of rock bream whilst indifferently wearing a stolen pair of women's sunglasses, or as he walks away, undisturbed by the suicide-by-falling of a man he has just told his story to, and what this brings to not just the film as a whole but its ability to connect with a certain breed of audience, the directing is arguably flawless. If one only has five minutes to spare, I recommend taking what could just be the most impressive scene of stature and presence in the history of cinema: the corridor fight scene, shot over four days (it is a continuous one take with only correction of punches comprising the totality of the computer editing intervention), where we are shown a trademark of the calibre of filmmaking that Oldboy contains. I've never seen anything like it. I watch it again and again, dumbstruck to its perfection, as composer Jo Yeong-wook's magnificent and moving score sombrely serenades over the visuals. Oldboy touches on some controversial and taboo subjects which deter the average viewer, but to the trained eye what Park has done with them is to create a piece of cinema that rip-roaringly strips back the layers of the heart to ultimate bareness, whilst still including some of the best action shots in any film to date. Oh Dae-su's tormented soul, battered and bruised both physically and mentally throughout, compliments the captured transition of his mental state into a 'monster' as well as the finest white wine with fish. Lee Woo-jin's distress, his patience and craftsmanship of a bizarrely pleasurable witty kind of sociopathic torture is portrayed with uncompromising genius: studying the sheer power of the final scenes in his penthouse and his ultimate relinquish into decline is taxing and infesting. Many cast Oldboy aside as a publicity stunt, and fail to see past the octopus. What I'm trying to say, in the end, is that Oldboy earns its place as the second greatest film ever made because of how is depicts the depth that human emotion can delve to.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"

My favorite movie,"Yes, I'm going to go ahead and say that this is my favorite movie. Take that as a bias for this review, or take it as an endorsement, it's up to you.First off, as you've probably read, if you're interested in the US remake, watch the original. I'm not saying you should watch the original first or second, or to skip the US version, I'm just saying you should watch the original whenever. It's better than the remake, regardless of the order that you watch them. There is a desperation in the main character of the original version that is lost in the remake, and to me, that desperation was the driving force behind the plot.While spending his time locked up, you get to see Dae-su go through all the stages of grief. But the difference is that the final stage, acceptance, has a different effect on him in that he becomes almost empty. I used the word desperation before because he becomes a man who has nothing to live for except revenge. While the hallway scene may seem ridiculous on paper, I had no trouble believing it when I first watched the movie. In other movies, his actions would be those of a man possessed, but Oldboy is about a man who has suffered, was hollowed out, and no longer knows fear.Chan-wook Park is an amazing writing and director. I wish I knew more about film theory so I could explain the various ways he makes this film spectacular. The most important thing to me is how he conveys emotion. Even watching it with subtitles, you'll understand the characters' plights. On top of all that, the twists and turns are completely unexpected assuming you haven't seen the remake or the ripoff ""The Samaritan"".If you're like me, after watching this, you'll go out and find the rest of Chan-wook Park's library.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"

Masterpiece,"My dumb younger self watched this movie like maybe 10 years ago and decided not to watch it till the end and just didn't finish it after the hallway fight scene because I couldn't understand what was happening and what it was boring. And boy was I wrong. And even though it was a stupid thing to do, I'm glad I didn't watch it till now that I could actually understand the movie and appreciate its filmmaking.I watched The Handmaiden from director Park Chan-wook a couple of months ago and I absolutely loved pretty much everything in that movie. Unironically actual cinema. It was so well-made and was shot so beautifully that even someone who doesn't watch many movies could feel and understand that it was made by an actual auteur and a filmmaker who knows what he's doing. You're watching a master at work.And this movie is no different in how well-made and well-thought-out everything in it is. The story is so good and the editing, direction, and music are so phenomenal and amazing that makes this just a level higher than The Handmaiden for me.The story is so good and the way they structure and tell this story is so amazing that even though the big twist was implicitly spoiled for me a while ago and I figured out what the twist of the movie was going to be even before watching it, the twist still hit hard and gave me shivers. The execution was just fantastic. It just goes to show that not everything is twists and turns, sometimes your story, directing, editing, music, and storytelling are just so good that it doesn't matter if someone got spoiled, the enjoyment of watching the film isn't lessened a bit. Though I admit that I wished I didn't know anything about it so it could've had a bigger impact on me, but nonetheless, it still hit like a ton of bricks.I just want to once again praise the music of this movie and say it's one of the best soundtracks of any film I've seen and I will be listening to it for a long time.The characters in this movie are really well-written and I think Lee Woo-jin is my favorite movie villain ever. I just don't think I can name another villain who's as psychotic and genius as this guy. The revenge plan this guy made is just mind-bogglingly convoluted and genius. He might not be the best movie villain ever objectively, but I'm sure he's in the top 10.Overall, I enjoyed the sht out of this movie and I think it's a masterpiece and one of the best movies I've ever seen. With only two movies, Park Chan-wook became my new favorite Korean director and I think I even like him more than Bong Joon-ho, and I gave Parasite a 10/10! Bong Joon-ho is still a master director, but I feel like Park Chan-wook is just on a whole other level.

But I never really looked for interesting, awesome movies to watch that might not have the PR reach to get my attention. I always left it up to Hollywood to decide for me what ""good"" movies I get to watch. That changed with Oldboy. By some stroke of luck I got to see this movie with a friend about 10 years ago. We watched it again, right after. I've seen it over 10 times by now and it was an entertaining watch (at the least) every time. I told myself, if there where movies made by Asians out there, THIS GOOD, then I can't just sit by and not watch them. I got off my lazy ass and searched the Internet from top to bottom and I've been rewarded greatly.

Oldboy is a phenomenal achievement. From its directing, to its acting, to the unpredictable and frankly genius writing. It's a masterpiece and one which is not hard to forget.The story is absolutely horrible and it pulls on my heart strings more every time I watch it! It's thoroughly gripping right from its brilliant opening shot, as it tells the story of a man imprisoned in a room for 15 years. It's difficult to comprehend and you'd be a robot if you didn't feel for the man! You might think that watching a man in a room for 15 minutes would be really boring, but Park (the director, not a park) manages to keep the most boring situation absolutely thrilling and a visual feast. We really get into Oh Dae Su's mind-set as we see his schizophrenic symptoms of ants crawling out of his skin. It's incredibly intense and your willing for him to escape.Of course he's subjected to even more psychological torture when he is freed as he has to find out who is kidnapper is, but more importantly why he was kidnapped. Oldboy isn't so much of a who's dunnit, but a why's dunnit which is what makes every frame so gripping. Unfortunately most films which are set-up like this as one big build up rely on a breath-taking finale and reveal, but fail to deliver, take Knowing for example. You don't need to worry about this with Oldboy as it features one of the greatest and most compelling finales ever! The screenplay is endlessly intelligent and imaginative, creating a multi-layered story with characters you can really feel for. What makes Oldboy so great is that you can actually sympathise with the 'villain' of the tale and sometimes condemn the heroe's actions.The three dimensional characters are breath of fresh air, compared to the 2D kids we often get. Oldboy isn't just great because of its ending, the journey getting there is equally as breath-taking and involving. Oldboy features one of the greatest fight scenes in film history and is sure to be engraved in your mind. I'd put it up there with the crazy 88 fight scene in Kill Bill, it's just a technical marvel. It's also just one example of Park's phenomenal directing. It's incredibly stylish as well as evoking the character's feelings. At first Oh Dae Su is just a vengeful maniac, but then he becomes more and more human as we find out things about him which I won't spoil.In the end Oldboy is a masterpiece. It's obvious that Park was a former philosophy student as the film contains so many provoking dilemmas. Not only is it a gritty revenge thriller, but it also has a huge heart and a massive emotional impact. The wondrous music also acts as another character in the film! By the end of it Oldboy will have you submitting to its knees in a puddle of tears with its cruel, but admirable finale. I can't see the American remake being any where near this standard. Make sure you see this, before you see that one!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
Even more scary than I thought!,"I remember when I saw this movie for the first time, and I thought the idea of a man being locked away for 15 years without being found, to be a little too incredible after all. After learning about the Kampusch-case of Austria I just realized that it was all too possible. It made me think even more clear when I re-watched OLDBOY, about how scary and unnervingly nasty a movie it is! No one deserves what these characters goes through.But it is a very masterful movie too. The director makes the very fine achievement to make us care for the prisoner, who is a really amoral jerk before he is kidnapped. But he gain quite a lot humanity while being in the abnormal imprisonment. It is not as well done as MR VENGEANCE though! The villain in OLDBOY is a sick bastard beyond comprehension, and he for one sort of deserve an ill faith.",,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
If this is the new face of Asian cinema...,"then it is definitely time to get reacquainted with the genre. This is a dark tale about Oh Dae-Su and his quest for vengeance and answers after 15 years of being imprisoned for no reason that he knows. There is some fight action in the film, but none of the wire-aided flying garbage that has come to represent so much of the Asian films of the last decade. The cinematography is very good, there is a lot of very dark humor scattered throughout, and the story is convoluted enough to leave even the wisest cinema buff guessing what the outcome will be. Though the ending left me feeling a bit disappointed, the rest of this tense and somewhat morbid film was very entertaining and I would highly recommend it !",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"Wow, simply wow","It's a COMPLETE movie!It really has everything. Normally when you see such a great storyline in a movie, the director focuses only on that. Because it speaks for itself. Its risky to put your money in such a movie, because you don't know how the movie is gonna come out. And thats the reason why you don't find people who give you a lot of money to make such a movie in the first place.Oldboy is an exception. Either they got the money they wanted, or they used the little money very smart. Because this movie really is great in every possible way. Storyline, as I said before. Script! Cinematography! Acting! You even have Action-Scenes, and not only some action, but the best uncut fighting scene I've ever seen. And I'm not even a fan of those kinda scenes, but in this movie I loved it. Oh, the soundtrack ""the last waltz"", simply fantastic.I don't know how successful this movie was, but Im sure that, would it have been a Hollywood-movie with some famous actors, it would have been one of the most successful movies ever.Anyway, I can only praise this movie and envy those who made it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
Asian Trash Cinema Has Become Respectable,"One of the Reasons Film Geeks like Tarantino Gravitated to and Revel in Asian Trash Cinema is that the Oriental Mind-Set does not Feel Comfortable in the West and therefore Their Movies are Off Center and ""Foreign"", Cultish and Creative in a way that can Never be Accomplished on the Home Front. They Literally Speak a Different Language. In More Ways than One.But Now, thanks to the Likes of QT and John Woo, among others, it has become Fashionable to Approach these Things in the Mainstream as High-Art. Decades Ago when there was Godzilla, Kung-Fu, and the Like, it used to be Laughed at and Scorned, Belittled and Bashed as Cheap Exploitation and Drive-In and Grind-House Fodder by the Late to Arrive Film Critics.Welcome to the New Millennium. It is a Fact this Film has Artistic Merit (didn't those aforementioned types) and a Bigger Budget and more Attention to Detail. But the Surprise is just how much Praise has been Heaped on this Hodgepodge of Sickening and Disgusting, Dirty and Unattractive Actors and Scenes. Have You been Repulsed Yet, have You been Shocked Yet?The Twisted Ending, and the Violence and Sadism, are neither that Repulsive or that Shocking in this Millennium so just why, You may ask, is this Film so Well Regarded. It is because those who have come Late to the Party, are Pretending to have been there all along.Above Average, Overrated, and Entertaining if You Dare.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
Grotesque,And painful to watch. Hardly seen a movie with such a high rating and such low resonance for myself. Never ever again.,1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
Profound exploration of the human condition,"Oldboy is not merely a movie; it's a profound exploration of the human condition, a testament to the power of storytelling, and a reminder of cinema's ability to push boundaries.It's exploration of the human psyche under extreme circumstances. The protagonist is thrust into a nightmarish odyssey of vengeance and self-discovery.As the layers of the story are peeled away, the audience is forced to confront the dark recesses of human nature, questioning the limits of revenge and the fragility of one's sanity.Park Chan Wook's masterpiece challenges, shocks, and leaves an indelible scar on the soul, urging us to contemplate the thin line between vengeance and redemption.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
Slow Poison to your veins....,"The brutal expression of this complex plot is what makes this movie a masterpiece. Chan Wook Park's latest installment of his Revenge series is clearly a work of superior art. The real winner here are the makers of the movie, the direction, cinematography, music, actors , their performance is immense and simply brilliant. The plot is complex but revolves around the life of Oh Dae Su getting abducted and locked in a prison for 15 years for no reason whatsoever. Then one day just like 15 years earlier he is released for one reason, to find he was locked. The rest of the movie shows how he achieves this and what are the twist and turns to achieve the same. The people who he meets during this time are really the real bearers of this story and the uniform brilliance in acting really makes the whole time spent on the movie worthwhile. The movie is very stylish, very graphic with blood and gore, very touchy on some I think this masterpiece is not given enough recognition over other similar movies. I hope this movie is never remade in any language since the subtle brilliance will definitely be lost in translation. I heard a Indian Crap was made lifting the story from OldBoy but we can blindly ignore the movie knowing nothing will even come close to the real masterpiece. This is deservedly in the Top movies in IMDb and should stay there forever.My rating 10/10 for giving me immense pleasure in viewing this masterpiece.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
Oh Boy!,"""Laugh and the world laughs with you. Weep and you weep alone.""Never have truer words been said. And I agree with the second part even more. This is a film where the hero and the villain are both lonely individuals because they're in a grieving process. But you can't be truly heroic or villainous when you're that pathetic, so ""Old Boy"" is less the tale of an upcoming good-vs-evil confrontation than the journey of a man who was stolen part of his life and had the remains to give it the only possible meaning: knowledge first, then revenge.I won't spoil the twist, one brilliant paradigm the film provides is that sometimes it's not about looking for the right answers but asking the right questions. But I'm talking in abstractions, let's just get into reviewing mode. Oh-Daeh Su is a man we first see drunk in a police station, he missed his daughter's birthday and is ready to go home when he's suddenly kidnapped and jailed in an apartment where he's given food, clean laundry and a TV as his only connection to the world, like Peter Sellers' character in ""Being There"".TV teaches him one thing or two when the rest of the experience hardens him. At that moment we're hooked already, we want to see his escape and want to know what this average-looking man ever did to deserve this? The way he ""gets off"" is an indicator that the film isn't exactly trying to match our expectations. Indeed, it's not as simple because it's much simpler than we'd have anticipated, he's released and finds himself with new clothes, a cellphone, and time to readapt to the city he left.There's even a scene that echoes ""Being There"" where he's confronted to street thugs, Oh Daeh-Su says ""Can 10 years' worth of imaginary training... be put to use?"" Apparently it can, and his fifteen years of isolation improved his physical skills as much as they damaged the social ones. Yet, everything feels too convenient, too weird, even in a restaurant, a young girl named Mido seems to grow an infatuation on him... even after he did the grossest thing ever; eating a live octopus! Is the film falling in the romance trap? Wait till the end, that's not the right question to ask.Now why did he eat the animal? That's a question. ""To feel something alive in his mouth after having been deprived from life"" seems like an organic answer, remember that Oh Daeh-Su has been totally desensitized from life and naturally pain, taking the life out of an animal or a human being would make him feel alive again as if he had sucked the juice of life to feel something again.The ""octopus"" scene sets our mind to the most gruesome parts where Oh Daeh-Su tracks down his captors until he finds his former warden and pulls seven teeth out before getting the names. All the discretion shots in the world can't distract from disturbing ""Marathon Man"" vibes but here again, it's not just about shocking for the kicks. When Oh Daeh-Su pulls off the tooth, believe it or not, he's the one suffering, he's the one who has surrendered to his bestial nature to commit atrocities he never thought he could.As he says: ""Even though I'm no more than a monster - don't I, too, have the right to live?"" And living, as far as he's concerned, is looking for the answers, there's something worse than suffering which is suffering for no reason, this could apply for violence in films, it can only work if there's a reason. So for a film so inclined to disturbing acts of violence, it's interesting that its central theme is knowledge.The film puts us in the mind of someone who wants to know but maybe the truths it's ready to reveal would make his torment worse, his life more hellish, but he's willing to take the risk... this is why you can't judge the film without considering its antagonist. Woo Jin-Lee is everything Oh Daeh-Su is not, he's handsome (very actually), rich, confident and he defines himself as a scholar in Oh Daeh-Su. So we have the man who wants to know and the scholar.And as the cat-and-mouse chase goes on and the plot gets thicker, Woo Jin-Lee's cool and detached demeanor fades out to unveil as tragic depths as Oh Daeh-Su did so we understand that they were the perfect match to each other until the climactic face-off. And like Bill in ""Kill Bill"", it's not just black and white morality. I know, you could see a ""Kill Bill"" allusion coming, there are so many parallels to draw between the two films and it's a fitting coincidence that QT was the Cannes Festival and gave the film its Grand Prize, but ""Old Boy"" flies high miles above American Cinema.Indeed, calling it a revenge story, an action film or a psychological thriller wouldn't give you one tenth of the idea. American movies have proven that a good editing, a compelling story and shocking value are integral to a film's success but I blame them for having given me the wrong idea about that South Korean's gem, perhaps one of the most immoral and amoral movies I've ever seen, it's just disturbing, disgusting and graphic on levels rarely reached by American cinema (Tarantino included)... on the surface.Indeed, it's impossible to give ""Old Boy"" a negative review. The reason is simple, the film is amoral but it's a masterpiece of amorality, it embraces it with a sort of morbid enthusiasm whose credibility depends on its sincerity, whoever uses violence can atone with it. Yes, the film is extreme but if it wasn't, we would feel either manipulated or cheated and the film might show revenge as something necessary but never satisfactory!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
