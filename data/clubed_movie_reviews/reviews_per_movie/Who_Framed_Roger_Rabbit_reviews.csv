Great fun for kids and adults alike.,"I'm a fan of both cartoons and film noir movies, and so Who Framed Roger Rabbit was a great experience to me. Set in the 1940's, in a shadowy atmosphere reminiscent of Bogart classics such as The Maltese Falcon, the movie blends in cartoon characters and live actors almost seamlessly. For me, one of the most interesting aspects of the movie was seeing Disney and Warner Bros cartoon characters in the same scenes - for the first time in film history, I believe. Who could forget the piano duel of Donald and Daffy? The live actors were a bit theatrical and over-dramatic at times, but not to an extent that would have made the film unbearable or bad. The cartoon characters saved a lot, too.Fast-paced, entertaining film that can be viewed by anyone. I liked it very much.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
technical marvel and a great comedy,"Who Framed Roger Rabbit is one of the zaniest and smartest movies to come out in a long time..Directed by Robert Zemeckis who later did Forrest Gump and Castaway among others, it stars Bob Hoskins as a washed up private eye in the 50s who gets dragged into a murder investigation in Toonland to help unravel a mystery and prove the innocence of a toon Roger Rabbit.One of the real treats of the movie is Kathleen Turner who does the voice of Jessica Rabbit..She is a perfect choice with that sexy sultry voice. The movie is great fun for the whole family..there is a little innuendo but like Jessica says..""I'm not bad..I'm just drawn that way""A real treat! Holds the record for most credits at the end of a movie (937!) On a scale of one to ten... 9",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
A unique movie experience,"""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"" is a wonder in the art of making films. Because it mixes live-action and cartoons, it was a challenge to be made. But that's exactly what makes it so distinguish and unique, especially considering that the idea works out so well. It's a different and original movie experience, a real winner.Yet, the film is more than a combination of live-action and cartoons. It has a dark atmosphere with lots of suspense, almost like a thriller. Classic humor isn't forgotten either, with numerous funny lines and hysterical gags, as well as humorous characters. The joke about «uncle Thumper» is one of the funniest, but there are many others. There's also a hilarious piano acting with Donald Duck and Daffy Duck, which they play the same piano song as in Tom & Jerry's short ""The Cat Concerto"" and have their hilariously silly battle. In fact, the soundtrack of the movie is excellent, including Jessica Rabbit's song ""Why don't you do right?"" and a suspense music very similar to one from the original ""Back to the Future"".Other movies that successfully mix live-action and cartoons are ""Mary Poppins"", ""Pete's Dragon"" and ""Bedknobs and Broomsticks"". Like ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"", those three movies combine this ""marriage"" very well. On the other hand, other movies such as ""Space Jam"" tried this idea but without the same success.I believe that this movie was made in a unique moment of inspiration. The sceneries are great, the designs, the cartoons, the backgrounds, the details, the animation, the special effects, the artwork... everything was carefully made and I much welcome that. This is one of the greatest Disney films.Great actors make the difference too. Bob Hoskins is English but speaks with an excellent American accent, not to mention that he does the amazing thing of acting against the air. Joanna Cassidy, Charles Fleischer, Alan Tilvern, Stubby Kaye, Cristopher Lloyd and Kathleen Turner are awesome too. Kathleen Turner is the voice of Jessica Rabbit, with that sexy and sensual voice. And... guess what! Even the singer Frank Sinatra has a minor role in this film as the hilarious but useless Singing Sword. Even without looking at the credits, who wouldn't recognize that great voice? Frank Sinatra's voice is just as recognizable as Nat King Cole's or Sterling Holloway's.As for the characters, the weasels are a perfect example of chronical stupidity. They're humorous because they're always laughing, even though they know what happens to someone who can't stop laughing.Marvin Acme is «the king of the jokes», always humorous and cheerful and at his funniest with his mythical hand-buzzer. Angelo is an idiot, drunk and greedy guy, but funny at the same time. Dolores is a great character. R. K. Maroon is an interesting character with half a dark side and half a good side. Judge Doom is a great villain, humorous, mysterious and somewhat sinister. Roger Rabbit is hilarious and very jolly - that's his only purpose as a cartoon, like he says himself. Jessica Rabbit is a very sexy cartoon, one of the most beautiful and sexiest ever - she's not bad, she's just drawn that way. Benny the Cab is funny. Baby Herman is a bit annoying - he might look innocent at first, but he is extremely rude and he loves to woo women. Eddie Valiant is another great character - grumpy, serious and funny sometimes. And he looks very much like my godfather in appearance.The movie takes place in Hollywood, 1947. It does recreate the 40's very well. That influence is notorious in many ways, including the cars used.Before finishing, let me say that I like rabbits very much. They're adorable and very cute animals, although in the cartoons they aren't as cute - but they're usually funny in cartoons.This should definitely be on Top 250.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Nothing short of miraculous,"Stop and think about this movie for a minute, and you realize that we are unbelievably fortunate that it even exists.Think about all the different cartoon characters who have cameos here. Think about how their respective owners had to put aside decades of competing against each other for gags that would last a few seconds of screen time.  Realise that, before this movie, the idea of combining fully rendered animated characters with live action footage was considered impossible.  And how the hell do you market a movie that includes both murder plots and fuzzy little cartoons?This movie is a miracle.I absolutely loved it as a kid, and although parts of it flew over my head I really did not care.  I did know that this is what animation can do when all the ""rules"" are totally ignored.  And why shouldn't they be?Now, as an adult, I appreciate ""Roger Rabbit"" for its gutsyness.  There is absolutely *nothing* like this anywhere.  It gets a solid Ten.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
"""Who framed Roger Rabbit"" is a classic","I was a little surprised that ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"" wasn't on the top 250. Almost everyone loves this film. It was a major breakthrough for movies. The cartoon world meets reality.Bob Haskins is to die for in this film, he plays such a great American detective and he didn't have much to work with. After all when he was talking to Roger, he wasn't really talking to anybody since it was a cartoon character. I love the way he develops his role so much, how he goes from this stick-to-the-book and all cartoons are bad to this lovable goofy guy due to Roger's insatiable love for life and cartoons. It's silly because it's a cartoon, but Roger and Bob clicked so well and are unforgettable.Christopher Lloyd... shudder! This guy gave me so many nightmares as a kid from his character as the judge. The ending where he reveals his true form, he is just terrifying and effective. Jessica Rabbit is so cool and sexy for a cartoon. She's just too much fun for this movie and is wonderful as a cartoon. ""I'm not bad, I'm just drawn that way"". My favorite scene is without a doubt when Eddie(played by Bob) is looking for Jessica and meets the crazy look-a-like in Toon Town. Just great and hilarious.Come on, fans! This is a terrific movie and deserves to be on the top 250 films of all time! It's a break through for cinema history and movies in general. It's a great one! I'd highly recommend this for the family and friends or just a Saturday with nothing to do.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
A film Classic like no other,"To make a great classic film i think it has to work on several different levels and this one not only plays on many different levels It scores tremendously.It is a great childrens movie. With zany classic characters such as Roger, the Weasles, and Benny the Cab. They are original crazy and fun. Also it is a mystery. It plays perfectly as one of those Old 50's detective stories. It is a milestone in film making. The scenes of the ""toons"" and humans sharing a world is great. I think the best scene as special effects go, is the one where Eddie and Roger are handcuffed together in his office. It looks so real!!!!! This movie is fun and creative and will go down in movie history. I don't know what else to say it is simply the best.Also do your self a favor and steer clear of the bad rip off Cool World.",,Anonymous,Animation
Very Imaginative,"Hired to find out the reason a cartoon actor named ""Roger Rabbit"" (voice of Charles Fleischer) is not performing in his usual manner, a private detective named ""Eddie Valiant"" (Bob Hoskins) discovers that Roger's wife ""Jessica Rabbit"" (voice of Kathleen Turner) has been ""playing pattycake"" with a human by the name of ""Marvin Acme"" (Stubby Kaye). However, not long after the incriminating photos are shown to Roger, Stubby just happens to die a violent death-and everybody suspects it was Roger who did it. Everyone that is, except Jessica who tells Eddie that the entire affair was a setup and that she isn't a bad person but that she was simply ""drawn that way"". Although not totally convinced that Jessica is as innocent as she claims, something doesn't seem quite right to Eddie and as a result he decides investigate a little deeper. But what he doesn't realize is just how dangerous his quest for the truth will eventually become. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this was a very imaginative picture which made excellent use of portraying real actors next to a host of cartoon characters. Very imaginative indeed. Likewise, there is also a certain amount of mystery mixed in with the cartoonish atmosphere as well. That being said, I thought that this was an entertaining film and I have rated it accordingly. Above average.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
One of the best of all time,"When this original movie was conceived and released in 1988, it was seen as a movie for the kids, but it soon found its way into the hearts of moviegoers everywhere. This was a landmark movie, cementing skills from all areas of Hollywood, from the budding special effects industry, to the acting skills of Bob Hoskins, to the SUPERB directing skills of Robert Zemeckis, to create one of the most impressive movies in Hollywood.While this movie was not the first of it's kind, it was definitely the first to have cartoons and real actors interact so seamlessly, and it is impressive that it was made over 15 years ago. Another impressive part of this movie is the soundtrack, using the classic 20's jazz song ""Why Don't You Do Right?"" to bring back the old jazz club scene, to make for a truly authentic feel from a cartoon character, as well as the detective music used all originally composed. All around, this movie is one that I Grew up with, and children and adults will be enjoying for decades to come, because Who Framed Roger Rabbit will be a classic in the movie world for a long long time.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

Smile  Darn Ya Smile,"This movie is excellent! It's funny, suspenseful,& witty. The leads, Roger & Eddie are likable in their own unique ways and the FX are breathtaking! Bob Hoskins & Chris Lloyd deserved Oscar nods IMO.WFRR is what most of today's CGI films ""pretend"" to be! A mature, family film that people of many generations can enjoy!Anyone who hasn't seen this film I definitely recommend it! If you like quirky comedies,fantasies, suspenseful films, or are a cartoon geek watch WFRR!...As a huge fan of all things comedic, I love the film's message about laughter!When the film opens, detective Eddie Valiant (Bob Hoskins) is this disenchanted, cynical alkie who hasn't gotten over the murder of his brother who was killed by a toon...Because of this Eddie[ who was once known for his penchant for solving toon-related cases, getting the colorful playful creatures out of trouble] resents ALL toons now and refuses to work for or with them.Too bad Roger Rabbit doesn't know this. He is a toon who is wanted for a murder he didn't commit and hounded by the creepy & corrupt judge/jury/executioner : Judge Doom. Thus he seeks Valiant's help. During their search for the true killer and their evasion of Judge Doom & his weasel cohorts, Eddie wonders how Roger can have such an exuberant clownlike spirit in the face of possible death. Roger tells Eddie ""a laugh can be a very powerful thing, why sometimes in life it's the only weapon we have.""The tone of the film is a mixture of dark noir frenetic tooniness a sultry yet strong damsel (the one and only Jessica Rabbit) and social racial allegory.The film's theme of minorities (the toons) vs. genocide & ""the man"" (Judge Doom)....And of Eddie's prejudices against toons (due to his brother's murder) disappearing at the end, thus he overcomes his alcoholism and grief or Roger's very motto of ""Laughter is a powerful weapon"" and how that helps Eddie in the final showdown (by killing the weasels with laughter and thwarting Judge Doom with a toon prop that malfunctions his diabolical machine).American Pop-culture & escapism ARE powerful weapons against misery, hatred & life's hardships in general. And they help unite all different walks of life.WFRR takes place in the WWII era towards the 50s...While the 40's were a time of American unity, escapism & pop-culture (what the ""toons"" represent) The 50's were more about cold hard, capitalism technology & being superior..I feel that the megalomaniac villain represents THAT as well as the racial/cultural insensitivity that came with the 50's.But no matter how you interpret WFRR it's an American masterpiece! There seems to be some controversy on what age it is appropriate for....Be warned this film IS violent loud climatic and more likely than not, will scare a young child. But if you are a parent you have to know your kid and realize what will give him or her nightmares. Having said that, even if you won't let junior watch it, that doesn't mean you, yourself can't enjoy it, the next time it comes on Encore Mystery.There are a lot of ""Judge Dooms"" these days...People who are perpetually serious & full of themselves & really have NO sense of humor at all...Don't be a Judge Doom...Watch this movie!",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

"Wow, and I mean wow!","One word, outstanding! i loved this when I was a kid. I'm 16 now and i still love it. The live action with the animation was perfectly blended, and I was howling with laughter at the beginning. The story is perfect, about a rabbit framed for a murder, when he suspects his wife of cheating on him. Bob Hoskins was brilliant as the melancholy drunk private eye, while Christopher Lloyd has great fun as the very scary villain. I would never have guessed the ending in a million years, totally unpredictable, and quite scary too. The real stars were the toons. Some of the funniest scenes were with them, like Eddie in ToonTown, and the weasels were a blast. reminded me of the Untouchables, actually. I didn't know for ages, that Kathaleen Turner voiced Jessica Rabbit, wow that woman is beautiful. Turner voiced Jessica brilliantly. in conclusion, a hugely satisfying part animated comedy, that both kids and adults will love. 10/10 Bethany Cox",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Who Can Watch A Loud 100-Minute Cartoon?,"I appreciated the inventiveness of this when it came out in the late '80s It was quite the ""talk"" of the business the way they mixed live characters with cartoon characters. That now has been copied, of course, but this was one-a-kind when it was released.For me, I never could warm up to the film. I tried several times but found Bob Hoskins and the animated characters so loud and so abrasive that it turned me off, big-time. Yeah, I was as amazed as anyone at some of the scenes, how seamlessly they blended it all to make it look so real. However, that abrasiveness wears thin, particularly after you've seen this movie at least once. This is like watching a loud: fun for awhile, but 100 straight minutes?! Tooo long.Warning: this is NOT a kids' movie. One reviewer here writes ""is's a great family film""....antihero writes ""any member of the family will like it,"",,on and on and on.

Every time I watch there is a magic moment, that the cartoons we all loved as kids are still the best today, even though we are into computer animation, Batman, X-Men, or anime, we can never say we hate those old Looney Toons or Disney shows. And the antics and jokes and gags and gimmicks they did will always remain the funniest, even though we dig jokes from Saturday Night Live or sex jokes these days. This is also the first time I've seen Disney and Warner cartoons for the first time! And not to mention Betty Boop and Droopy!

The best family film of the 80's,"I say this film is a family film because that is what it is.  Anyone in the family will like it.  It pitches it's animated rabbit to the kids, and for the teens and adults, they can look for humor in other things.  The plot is a complicated one (like most detective mysteries) that brings a drunken detective back to the detective game of cartoons.  Sometimes funny, sometimes compassionate, always entertaining.

Toontown Tribulations,"There's a great sequence in the 1945 film ""Anchors Aweigh"" where Gene Kelly dances with cartoon stars Tom & Jerry. Director Robert Zemeckis had always loved that movie, and in 1987 he decided to take the concept one step further. He wanted to see human characters co-exist with fully animated cartoons, in a three-dimensional space. Moreover, Robert Zemeckis wanted to do it for an entire movie.""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"" takes place in 1947, in an alternative Hollywood where people and cartoon characters live side-by-side. One of these ""toons"" is called Roger, and he is accused of murder. Now it's up to our prejudiced and often drunken ""hero"" to exonerate him.Before the cameras started rolling, Zemeckis explained that he was working from three clearly defined premises. The film was to maintain Disney's high-quality of animation, Warner Bros' characterization and legendary cartoonist Tex Avery's zany humour. To ensure that this was made possible, Zemeckis hired Canadian animator Richard Williams to personally supervise all the hand-drawn sequences.The resulting movie was unique in several ways. For example, it was the first (and only) time in animation history that Walt Disney's characters Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck performed together with Warner Bros' Bugs Bunny and Daffy Duck. Their appearances were regulated in a detailed contract which stipulated that all the cartoon stars would receive an equal amount of screen time.""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"" premiered in the United States in 1988. Due to its ""spicy"" theme, the film was released by the studio's adult-oriented Touchstone division. It was a critical and commercial success, rekindling an interest in the Golden Age of Cartoons and sparking the so-called Disney Renaissance. Richard Williams won a well-deserved Special Achievement Oscar for his animation direction.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
One of a kind,"I have never seen another movie like ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"". Sure, there are other movies that blend animation with live action, such as ""Space Jam"", but no other does it as seamlessly and more importantly, as entertainingly. The movie opens with a cartoon which by itself is hysterical. What follows immediately after the cartoon is even funnier and sets the tone for the zaniness and unexpectedness of the film. The jokes and sight gags are non-stop and the actors interact so perfectly with the cartoons that Toon Town seems to be a real place. Bob Hoskins is wonderful as the down-on-his-luck private eye who ends up protecting Roger Rabbit and Christopher Lloyd is equally great (and terrifying) as the evil Judge Doom. But the movie belongs to Roger Rabbit; Charles Fleischer deserved at least an Oscar nomination for his fantastic voicing of the character. Roger Rabbit is an instant classic cartoon character and has countless hilarious lines. ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"" is great for kids but even better for teenagers and adults. I know that I now enjoy it even more than I did when I saw it for the first time as a seven year old. ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"" is one of the most enjoyable films ever made, and as Roger Rabbit says, perhaps describing the movie as a whole, ""My whole purpose in life is to make... people... laugh!""

"Great promise, falls a little short","On paper I should like this film more than I did, since it's an homage to the old Looney Tunes cartoons mashed up with film noir, things I love, and had special effects integrating animation with real actors that still hold up today. I like how subversive it is, with the darkness of the toxic chemical substance and the critique of consumerism and corruption. I didn't like the new toons - the character and voice of Roger Rabbit (Charles Fleischer) was unappealing, and the giant boobs on Jessica Rabbit (Kathleen Turner) were too much. Something about it lacked the charm of the old cartoons, as if it was working too hard to get all the references and slapstick in. It's certainly watchable, and amusing to pick up on all of its references, but fell a little short for me.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Lightning in a bottle,"That WHO FRAMED ROGER RABBIT was made at all is a marvel to me-- I'm sure getting all the studios that owned these characters to agree to let them all on the screen was a real feat-- but I have no doubt it was made at just the right time in movie history. The 80s saw an upswing in interest in the classic Hollywood animations of the 30s and 40s, and the 70s nostalgia for classic noir was still lingering, leading to classics like BODY HEAT. Somehow, this led to a perfect combination of ideas. The special effects technology of the 1980s also allowed the fusion of live action and animation to be done in a manner far more sophisticated than past decades.So yeah, I consider ROGER RABBIT a great film. The story is both a spoof of noir conventions and a dramatic story you can take just seriously enough, populated by memorable and endearing characters. Everyone does great work, but you have to give it to Bob Hoskins, who toes the line between comedy and hardboiled drama well. It's often described as a kid's movie, though with the sheer amount of sexual jokes and extreme cartoon violence, I am shocked some moral watchdog has yet to complain (at least, I've never heard of anyone complaining about this movie's content, not even from those who think things like HAPPY FEET and HARRY POTTER were directed by Satan himself).The idea of a sequel was in talks for a few years, but to be real, I am glad they never came to be.

One of the great films noirs.,"Zemeckis' film boasts all the requirements of film noir - loser detective, femme fatale, patsy, shadowy noir look, corrupt big business interests - and yet is really an anti-noir: the negative stereotypes are reversed; the dissolution of boundaries and breakdown of reason, so traumatic in noir, is here celebrated.This is the work of the animation half, itself a form hostile to boundaries and reason, even if the thriller mechanics means it is not quite as liberated as the average Looney Toon.  Not only is this (possibly) the first blockbuster film to allude to Joyce's 'Ulysses' (the Toon Town/Night Town sequence), but is also an allegory of the McCarthy era, reminding us how animation bravely protested when live action kept schtum.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Brilliant - for 15 minutes,"It is impossible not to enjoy Roger Rabbit for its inventiveness...but after that, what else is left? You certainly don't care about the characters. Roger himself is extremely annoying for the most part. In fact, the best part of the film for me was the beginning... about 5 full minutes of pure cartoon fun, between Roger and a baby - reminiscent of the kinds of situations that we usually see Wile E; Coyote getting himself into. It was a scream. Bu then the rest of the film takes over, an d after the first few minutes of being amazed at the technical slight of hand...it begins to go downhill. By two-thirds of the way through, I was barely paying attention any more. The only thing that kept me awake was trying to see how many different cartoon characters I could recognize and remember where they came from originally.So all in all, I couldn't find myself capable of giving it more than a 5... if I were voting on the first 5 minutes I would have given it a 9; if I were voting just on technical merit i would give it a 10... but as a whole?

It's a...deadly...serious...business!,"Watching this for the umpteenth time, I am struck by how much this movie resembles Brazil (1985). What, you will say, that was a grim and serious story set in a horrible dystopia. Ah, yes, but one of its main satirical weapons was its over-the-top humour.Well, Roger Rabbit inverts the formula. We seem to have a zany cartoon comedy. but underlying this is a story about racism and genocide. The cartoon characters, who coexist with humans, are shown as a tolerated subordinated race, good for ""singing and dancing and running and jumping"". They are called ""Toons"", which resembles another epithet that used to be a nasty name for black people. And the ""solution"" is exactly that - a solution of benzene and acetone that will exterminate the Toons by dissolving them.Both movies are set in something that resembles the 1940's, which gives lots of opportunity for spoofing films noir of the sort that Bogart et al. used to make.How could something so serious be funny? The best comedy is just a hare's breadth (sorry, couldn't resist) removed from tragedy, which is why Hogan's Heroes is so funny while Disney comedies fall flat from gooey sentiment.

The best of its kind!,"Roger Rabbit is a marvel, especially considering when it was made. Since 1988, there have been other films combining animation and live action (think: Cool World, Space Jam, and similar crap) but none of them have matched the quality of Roger Rabbit despite the fact that it preceded them by years and was made without the benefit of computer graphics. I'm not just referring to its almost seamless blend of Toon Town and The Real World, either--though certainly, the artistry of Roger Rabbit still manages to outshine its various clones by far. The plot, characters, and screen writing are perfect, hilarious, and a lot of fun.Bob Hoskins is amazing--I love the husky voice and accent he's adopted--and Joanna Cassidy, who plays Dolores, is rarely praised as she should be, it seems. Charles Fleischer, as the voice of Roger Rabbit (and a few other characters!) is perfect, too. He's an incredibly talented voice actor and this fact is more than obvious here.I also want to mention how much I like the lovely, melancholy soundtrack of this film.I loved this movie when it came out--I was just out of kindergarten--and I love it now.

Yeah it looks great but...,"This movie takes place in 1947 in an imaginary world where cartoons are alive. Roger Rabbit is framed for killing somebody. Down and out detective Bob Hoskins is hired to find out who did it.This movie has a lot going for it. Virtually every cartoon character in existence (up till 1947) puts in an appearance. The animation is superb and the mix of live action with it is seamless. The movie starts off with a Looney Toons type cartoon--but sped up FAST! Also Jessica Rabbit (voiced by Kathleen Turner) is VERY interesting to watch. This film is purportedly an allegory on how blacks were treated in 1940s Hollywwod--all the ""toons"" here are servants or waiters and all live in a separate section of town. There are also a ton of inside jokes. I liked it--but not completely.Bob Hoskins, Christopher Lloyd and Joanna Cassidy give terrible performances--but the script WAS against them and they were basically reacting to nothing. Roger Rabbit himself was a VERY annoying character--I could care less what happened to him. The storyline was vague and more than a little confusing--it kept coming to a screeching halt countless times when a ""toon"" made a cameo. No characterizations either--the cartoons are more 3-dimensional than the humans! The script also thinks it's more clever than it actually is.I didn't like this much when it came out in 1988--it was a MONSTER hit. My feelings haven't changed much. Still--a lot of people liked this and kids will love it. Use your own judgment. For the animation and live action mix alone I give it a 7.""I'm not bad.

It's perfectly cast. It's ... perfect. This film has aged very well and DESERVES to be in the top 250. So, why isn't it? My guess: it's still receiving backlash from many who see it as a kid's cartoon- a non computer animated kid's cartoon at that. It's also a better Zemeckis film than Back to the Future, which is in the top 250. Roger Rabbit is a true original and an American classic. Let's give it the respect it deserves. 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
"It sags a bit in the middle, but the Tooney characters are never far away and it's mainly them that make this memorable","Toon hating whiskey drinking private eye Eddie Valiant (Bob Hoskins) is assigned to prove Roger Rabbit's innocence when he is the prime suspect in the murder of toon town boss Marvin Acme (Stubby Kaye). Roger Rabbit becomes a suspect when he learns of his wife Jessica's affair with Acme. But who actually framed Roger Rabbit?Who Framed Roger Rabbit is a classic blend of live action animation combined with a real world motion picture and it's these aspects combined that make it so memorable (it was also very unique back in 1988). The audience are treated to a wonderful 5 minute cartoon at the start which was great for me as it harked back to my youth - it reminded of the wonderful cartoons from my youth. The story in itself plays as a murder mystery and this aspect alone is strong enough to make the film worth watching (even if it is a little bit predictable). Hoskins initially seems like an unsympathetic character, but my impression of him changed as the story unfolds - we do at least get an understanding of why he is the way that he is.The real stars of the show here are the animated characters and whenever Roger Rabbit is on the screen you're almost guaranteed a laugh. Fans of the 'cartoons of old' are guaranteed some fun here with various cartoon character cameos from the likes of Daffy Duck, Donald Duck, Yosemite Sam & Porky Pig just to name a few. The zany antics of the cartoon characters really do make this a fun and joyous experience. The scene in the lift with Droopy and Hoskins was simply genius. In this film we also get to see Jessica Rabbit who is arguably the sexiest cartoon creation in existence (even though it feels a bit weird saying this).The only minor criticism that I have with this film is that it does sag a bit in the middle, but it's never a major problem as those crazy Tooney characters are never far away and it is definitely they that give us the most laughs.Who Framed Roger Rabbit is an excellent film that was quite a unique experience when it was released and it's a film that still holds up well today. The showdown between Lloyd and Hoskins at the end was also incredibly funny and was also quite imaginative as well. A great little film that is well worth checking out.FINAL NOTE; this film has a PG rating, but it's probably best not to let really young children watch this as it does have quite a dark plot and can be quite violent at times.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Great movie!Excellent!!!,I have always loved Who Framed Roger Rabbit.Christopher Lloyd is great as Judge Doom and Bob Hoskins was very good. It was so cool to see most of the great cartoon characters together in one film. The music is great by Alan Silvestri!

What's up Doc? Absolutely brilliant classic!,"Ahhh, what a classic, with an unforgettable performance by Bob Hoskins!It is a world where toons (animated characters) live among humans. Private Detective Eddie Valiant (Bob Hoskins) hates toons ever since a toon murdered his brother. Now Eddie is hired by R. K. Maroon - the head of Maroon Cartoon Studios - to investigate rumours of adultery. Jessica, the wife of one of his stars, Roger Rabbit, is supposedly having an affair with Marvin Acme, the owner of Acme Corporation and Toontown.Eddie is a grumpy man who likes his Scotch, but in need of money, so he takes the job. When Roger Rabbit learns of his wife's affair, he is devastated, and when Marvin Acme is found murdered the next day, Roger becomes the prime suspect.The animation - movement, shadows, interaction - blends fantastic with real actors; incredibly well considered the film was made over three decades ago. When Roger takes refuge with Eddie, Eddie must do everything in his power to uncover the truth. However, there are much more than meets the eye, as secrets and cover-ups are revealed.Christopher Lloyd stars as the film's antagonist, Judge Doom, who found a way to destroy toons, hence they are petrified of him. 'Who framed Roger Rabbit' delivers on every level! This is top notch entertainment with a good story, great visuals, and Bob Hoskins is a dish, might I say! This film is a unique cinematic experience, and one I thoroughly enjoyed!",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
An Animation Fan's Dream,"For anyone who grew up watching cartoons (I can't imagine anyone who didn't!), this movie is perfect for you!  If anything, it is just amazing to see the unprecedented collaboration between Disney, Warner Brothers, and Tex Avery.  Like the geek I am, I squealed with delight when Donald and Daffy duked it out in a piano duel and when I saw the memorable skydiving scene with Mickey and Bugs.  It was also fantastic to see other animation legends, like Droopy and Betty Boop.I enjoyed this movie a lot when I was a kid (even though the villain, Judge Doom, scared me a little).  As for the adult jokes and innuendoes, they just flew over my head at that time.  I just laughed at the baby because he smoked and talked like an adult.  Only until I watch it now that I'm delightfully shocked at the adult humor involved.  It is a movie that appeals to the older set with its classic characters and modern humor, but kids can still enjoy it by seeing some of their favorite characters.As for the work that went into this movie, I just find it amazing.  Bob Hoskins, in particular, deserved an Oscar just for the degree of difficulty he took in the role of Eddie Valiant.  Not only did he have to disguise his thick British accent, but also he had to act with invisible characters and make it all look realistic.  And what a job he did!  As a viewer, you are immersed in this world where people and toons come together.  You get so caught up in the storyline and the characters that you don't really take a step back and think that this is just impossible.The actors, the puppeteers, the animators, the directors, and countless other staff members just did a phenomenal job with this movie.  It is truly one-of-a-kind, and I don't think we'll see anything quite like this again. Sure, there's been ""Space Jam"" and ""Looney Tunes: Back in Action,"" but I don't think those movies come close to the innovation and memorable storytelling that ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"" achieved.  Kudos to everyone involved in this picture.  Hopefully someday they can all get together again.  I think I speak for many people when I say that we're eager to go back to Toontown!My IMDb Rating: 10/10.  My Yahoo! Grade: A+ (Oscar-Worthy)",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Maybe it's just me, but this movie stunk","If being a great technical achievement is basis for being a great movie, then let's give out 10's to all those 3-D flicks from the Fifties and Sixties. Don't want to do that? Then, let's judge it as a movie. OK, I just did, and it gets a 1 out of 10.Maybe it's just me... But, I found NO appeal in Roger himself. None. In fact, I hated him. Annoying voice, annoying personality, NEVER a funny line, movement, or gesture. Well, if he was not funny, then he was likable? No. Not funny plus annoying is not a good start in a title character. And, Jessica Rabbit, how did Roger ever marry her. Why would he want to, no personality, flirt, just a sleazy trouble magnet. Further, why would she want to marry him?. A nerdy, screw-up. And, why was she drawn with such dripping sexuality? I was torn between hoping her gown would slip off, and wondering why I was thinking such thoughts about a cartoon. Weird. Sick. Yuck.Hoskins did a yeoman's job, but most of his accomplishment was acting to the animated characters. As a character in a drama, I thought he came off a little flat.  His character was ultimately very predictable.You know, I don't even remember Christopher Lloyd... I guess he was an over-the-top bad guy. Shocker. Now, there is something every great movie should have:  A cardboard bad guy, and an very unfunny cartoon as the good guy. NOT.Now, the ratio between 1 and 10 ratings  (a stat I check all the time) was almost 10:1. So maybe it was just me... If you rent it, make sure you have someone to talk to, because you won't want to waste time following the story.  Just talk over it.",1.0,Anonymous,Animation
What can I say?,"by Dane YoussefGee... What can I say?What can be said that hasn't been said a zillion times about this movie before? By film critics, film buffs, the other user posters on IMDb and every other person who saw this one?But you know what? I'm not here to really promote this movie, or analyze it... I'm here to write my love letter for it. We're all here to share our movie-going experiences, aren't we? Well, f*ck it, here's mine.I still remember being a little prepubescent boy sitting in the theater watching this movie, totally amazed and astounded by what I saw. Seeing this wacky cartoons going through a routine Tom-and-Jerry-type episode... and then... it was amazing how these movie actually tricked you, convinced you to believe that human and cartoons can exist in the same universe and dimension of reality.There are many a great pleasures and moments in this movie, one of them is the duet at a ""toon"" night club called ""The Ink & Paint Club"" where Eddie goes to get information about Roger's wife, and the opening act is a dueling duet on the piano featuring two great legends, Daffy Duck and Donald Duck (I doubt there's any biological relation there) together at last. Why did it take so long for these two to get together? Well, they are rival entertainers for rival studios, so...But of course, the dueling duet ends in an all-out war. Come on, we both know the hatchet wasn't going to stay buried very long.The whole movie is worth renting just to see the two great legends, Daffy and Donald, put their differences aside for one memorable dueling piano duet ALONE.""Roger Rabbit"" pioneered not only animation and film-making style, but acting, writing, directing and a meshing together of different genres.Imagination, luck, brilliance, skill... it's all been blended so perfectly here... just like the animation and live-action.Funny, sharp, satirical, smart, thrilling, skillful, bright, bold, hard-boiled, colorful... at even at times, a little scary.It one three Oscars, not to mention an Honorary Award for it's Technical Advancements.Hell, it deserved every single Oscar it got! And a few it didn't. It should've won every single Oscar that year. Maybe some from others...God, you know, I still remember finding my little Rescue Ranger toy in my pocket and running in back-and-forth through my fingers... I remember being very careful not to loose it as I watched this. And it was hard, damn it, all of what was going up there on the screen.There's the best of the everything here. Everyone should see it, pure and simple. It's a movie... for pretty much everybody. A masterpiece in more ways than one.So help me God, I cannot think of a better actor for the role of the classic, hard-boiled, rock-bottom, not-too-smooth P.I. than Bob Hoskins. I don't think he's ever played a better role in his whole life. He seems to be a strange collision of Sam Spade and W.C. Fields, in some strange way.Christopher Lloyd proves yet again (as he does in all his roles) that he's one of the most underrated actors in the business. He's known for playing the bizarre, the crazy, the wired. But his ability to play villains, particularly more sedate and low-key ones, is overlooked so much, it's grounds for a discrimination lawsuit.Kathleen Turner is damn perfect as Roger's Mrs; especially considering that all she does here is a voice.Roger Rabbit"" pioneered not only animation and film-making style, but acting, writing, directing and a meshing together of different genres. Literature purists and scholars (yes, I mean geeks) will note that this movie is adapted from a novel by Gary K. Wolf, who specializes in science-fiction.For those of you who are enamored with this movie and just learning this, are actively considering dropping this review right this instant and running to your nearest library and bookstore to pick up a copy to read as an addition to the movie or just out of curiosity, I should warn you that the movie is completely unfaithful to the novel.Oh, both are clever and well-written spoofs of the whole ""hard-boiled private-detective mystery noir genre,"" but the two are so completely different, in writing-style, character dialouge, plot, theme, even ending, you wonder why they even bothered to get Wolf's permission and pay him a royalty. Gee, usually these Hollywood types are a little more snaky and know how to exploit all these loopholes.You've no doubt heard the old saying, ""You can't please everyone, so don't even bother."" Because when you try, you wind up ultimately pleasing no one. Least of all, yourself. It's strange, this movie seems like an exception to that one little rule. I mean, I know there's an exception to every rule, but this is one you're sure is completely iron-clad. This is a movie for everyone. This is a movie that will please everyone. And you know what else? It never got the credit for that. Think about what a big train-wreck this movie could have been. How many things could have gone wrong.How many years Disney and Warner have been at war, all this time, money for a experiment that could have gone worse than than the killer bees and the atomic bomb. And yet, glory be, it didn't. We all live for days like this, filmmakers, film critics... and film lovers.The best part? After it was all over... Roger and Baby Herman went on to star in several of their own cartoon shorts before the movie for real (""Dick Tracy"" and ""Honey, I Shrunk The Kids"").Good for them.--In Honor of Roger And His Pals, Dane Youssef",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Great fun film for both adults and older kids,"Down on his luck Eddie Valiant is hired by cartoon studio producer RK Maroon to help get his main star, Roger Rabbit, to focus on the job rather than his wife.  To do this Valiant is told to get photographs of Jessica Rabbit with another man.  He does this but it only serves to send Roger into a rage and he storms off the lot.  When the man that was photographed with Jessica turns up dead the next day, Roger is wanted by the police and the toon hating Judge Doom.  Roger goes to Valiant to help him, but is there more to the story than meets the eye?I saw this film years ago in the cinema as a child and loved it then just as much as I do now.  The plot is a classic bit of noir - complete with drunken, bitter private dick, a beautiful but untrustworthy femme fatale, plot twists and a patsy.  The twist here is that this is a kids film (more or less) and that it features cartoon characters!  This works well - making it accessible for kids but still clever enough for adults.That's not to say that the adults won't like the cartoons too.  With so many famous characters making cameos there is plenty of cartoons for adults to enjoy.  The humour of the film is quite violent and may not be appropriate for younger children - especially the steamroller scene near the end which I found a little upsetting when I saw this as a preteen.  Regardless of that the film is still pretty funny and can be enjoyed by most, even if kids won't get the plot or references to other movies.Hoskins is good - he fits the rundown noir mould well but can also clown when he has to.  Lloyd is a great bad guy - scary enough to bother kids but not comic to the point that he is a clown character to adults.  Jessica Rabbit sticks in the mind, likely one of the best femme fatales if she were real, she is voiced really well by Turner and the animation fits her voice well.  Fleischer's Roger is good for a cartoon character but it is often the other cartoon characters that are more enjoyable; not only the various cameos but also the weasels and the taxicab.Overall this is a good movie but maybe not for young kids due to the dark edge and some scary scenes.  However for older children and adults this is real good fun - a good plot, a noir atmosphere and a clever twist on the creation of cartoons in the real world.",,Anonymous,Animation
a top-notch industrial adventure,"Robert Zemeckis' fifth feature movie at the heel of the phenomenal BACK TO THE FUTURE (1985), WHO FRAMED RABBIT ROGER is an enormously entertaining amalgamation of live-action and traditional 2D animation, unprecedentedly assembles a plethora of cartoon characters from both Disney and Warner Bros. stocks. A none-too-mind-boggling whodunit in 1940s Hollywood where human society co-exists with a toon world.Rabbit Roger (voiced by Fleischer) is a name toon star who is framed for the murder of Marvin Acme (Kaye, in his silver-screen swan song), the mogul of Acme Corporation, and a human private eye Eddie Valiant (Hoskins), whose past tragic brush with the toon world still rankles, is dragged into the scramble to shake thing up, scupper a deleterious scheme of the evil Judge Doom's (Lloyd), settle the old score and finally he and Rabbit Roger establish a mutually respected bond between humans and toons.Decades later, the picture still looks pristinely stunning, a seamless coalescence of the 3- dimensional real world with the 2-D fantasy inspires great immediacy and fun, in both scenarios where Eddie is thrown into the toon-land or the other way around, toons wandering in the Hollywood lot or engaging a car-chasing in the street of L.A.. A petulant Hoskins is quite gung-ho in acting in front of a green-screen, and Lloyd is a palatable villain with cardboard identity and a cunning plan which is too prescient to be sardonic. A shrewd revelation of the villain is the victims' very own kind, would spawn different reactions from various projects, on the negative side, Frank Oz's god-awful THE STEPFORD WIFE (2004) brings to mind, but here, it can easily bypass any unwarranted hard feelings as who gives a fig about what a fruitcake toon thinks.The main cartoon characters are tailor-made to defer to the lowest common denominator - a kid's talkie, Rabbit Roger comes off as irritably garrulous, and his pleading of ""toons are made to bring laughter"" rings hollow since it fails to connect with today's reality, as we have been constantly assured and re-assured that animated works can do a whole lot more than cheap pratfalls and belabored jokes; the overtly risqué image of his wife Jessica (voiced by an uncredited Kathleen Turner) shows the industry really doesn't mind pigeonholing female characters into wishful- thinking love interests with inherent crassness, which is also confirmed by the one-note girlfriend role from Joanna Cassidy.On a larger scale, the movie's overwhelming success has at least partially sparkled a rekindled mass appreciation of the studio animation, which in the decades to come, has been prevailing over the global market henceforth, a throwaway question mark arises, nevertheless, how come a sure- fire sequel has yet to be green-lit regarding that the innovation in the animation department has already gone through a sea change, certainly, its appeal would exceed those live action performance-capturing ventures Zemeckis has consistently but unfruitfully experimented thrice in THE POLAR EXPRESS (2004), BEOWULF (2007) and A Christmas CAROL (2009).",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
They just don't make movies like this any longer.,"""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"" is one great movie. One reason I absolutely love it is because the animation was all done by hand. Now, cartoons mixed with real life are all done by computer. Secondly, the acting is awesome. The actors really made the characters come to life. They really convince you that they are interacting with the toons. The most prominent reason as to why I really like this movie is because the humor is absolutely genius. There's a good mix between children's jokes and a sort of risqué comedy.Overall, this is my favorite animated feature, maybe even my favorite movie of all time. I can watch it over and over again and the humor is just as fresh as the first time I watched it.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Who Framed Roger Rabbit,"This half-animation/ half-live-action tribute to the film-noir genre, crossed with the effervescent gag spirit of the old ""Looney Tunes"" series, is good and enjoyable, but not as good as it's reputation would suggest. At the time there was lots of bragging about the ""revolutionary"" mixing of animation and live-action, which is sort of mystifying, seeing as it was already done way back in the 40's with films like The Three Caballeros. Oh well, the manipulative force of the media at it again. On a side-note, Bob Hoskins is just marvelous as declined alcoholic detective Eddie Valiant, and Christopher Lloyd (of ""Back to the Future"" fame) fits perfectly as the paranoid Judge Doom.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation

Playing Patty-Cake With Jessica Rabbit,"Filmed way back in 1988 on a substantial-sized budget of $50 million - ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit?"" was produced in the era prior to CGI animation, and, I'd say that this, in itself, has proven to be quite a notable achievement.Impressively integrating live-action sequences with animated characters and backgrounds - ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit?"" pays respectful tribute to the Golden Age of American animation.All-in-all - This cleverly realized adventure-comedy from yesteryear is certainly well-worth a view, especially since it won an Academy Award for ""Best Visual Effects"".",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Should be a lot of fun, but weighed down by some MAJOR flaws","Honestly, it was a GIF of Christopher Lloyd from the finale of this film that made me want to finally give this movie a thorough chance, but even that part didn't vibe as much for me as it did when I saw it in the GIF form with no audio. It came off as very surrealist, and pretty frightening - it made me think, ""Whoa, maybe Who Framed Roger Rabbit is a much darker movie that I realized"". Upon conversing with people, that seemed to be the consensus. However, after watching, I can't say that I agree.What's actually dark about this movie? Almost nothing, other than the fact that one person dies (though he was a bad person), and so does one living, breathing, cartoon shoe. Outside of that, it's mostly your standard Looney Tunes vibes crossed with your standard detective movie vibes - though it never goes as dark or complex as the best of that film genre - it always floats on a very surface level with it, focusing more on tongue-in-cheek references to cartoons and redundant themes rather than spending time creating any truly heady plot twists or surprises, as all great noir films do.For the first 20-30 minutes, I was really having a pretty good time. Of course, the way the animation is crossed with the live action is impressive, and has never quite been done the way it's done here. That is, by far, the strongest suit of the movie. Bob Hoskins hatred towards ""toons"" was quite comical at first, until they add in the dramatic ""a toon killed my brother"" element, which immediately removes all humor from this otherwise hilarious part of his character's personality. What's left once you take the humor away from that? Literally nothing else. Bob Hoskin's character is 1-dimensional as a mug, and once that's tainted he is ruined. He's irritable, he hates toons - and there's NOTHING else to him. Half way through the film, he becomes completely redundant, and stops being likable. And then, there's Roger Rabbit himself, who is just much, much, much worse. I guess they purposely found the MOST annoying voice actor possible? His voice is like nails on a chalkboard, and so is...his personality. There is nothing enjoyable about Roger Rabbit, ever, throughout the entire film. Through the main body of the film, when he has the most screen time, I honestly really wanted something to happen to him so he would just go away.Outside of Roger Rabbit himself being barely tolerable, the strangely unappealing casting, and the abrasive sound editing which has all obnoxious cartoon sound effects mixed at about 175% volume over all other dialogue, music, and FX, Who Framed Roger Rabbit does still manage to be a rather entertaining movie from start to finish. It's just that once it's over, I look back and it's the things I disliked that stuck with me most. Jessica Rabbit is an icon for a reason. Christopher Lloyd and his ""dip"" were quite memorable, but aside from those two - I didn't really find any other characters in this film likable at all, nor were there any sequences that I feel I'd ever want to see again.Maybe COOL WORLD really is better than this?!",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
a great technical achievement...and?,"The years have not been kind to ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit.""  It was hailed unanimously at the time of its release as a ""dazzling technical achivement"", etc. and I'm not going to complain about that aspect of it.  The craftsmanship in blending live action with animated characters is superb, but the movie has little else to offer.  Of course, I was a little kid at the time of the movie's release, and I think what impressed my easily-amused mind the most was the atmosphere of real-life fantasy the filmmakers had created--not the story.  Upon a recent viewing of WFRR, I found myself generally unimpressed with it, and often just bored with what was happening on-screen.  Meticulous attention to technical detail can only drive a movie so far before the viewer gets suspicious of its other attributes.  The humor is often loud and forced, and some scenes are so melodramatic and sappy you could pour them on your pancakes.  The plot plays out like ""Chinatown Lite"" and finds a good (if exaggerated) villain in Christopher Lloyd's Judge Doom. But ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit?"" will always be remembered for its attention to technical detail, not its plot.  And I can't complain about its craftsmanship--living in an era where digital computer graphics have rendered film animation a simple, even lazy task, it's refreshing to see something that obviously took a lot of effort to put together.  ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit?"" is more a pop-culture artifact that a seamless cinematic masterpiece, which is a shame considering its potential.4/10",4.0,Anonymous,Animation

Who'd win in a fight, King Kong or Mighty Joe Young? Did Adam and Eve have Belly Buttons? Kids don't realize that different characters belong to different companies and couldn't and wouldn't appear together, or would they?Director Zemeckis, Author Gary K.

Because the subject of the case is their Star Cartoon Character, Roger Rabbit, the Detective balks at accepting the assignment because, ""I don't work for Toons!""(A Toon being one of these ""living"" cartoon characters.)The economic situation at The Valiant Detective Agency dictates otherwise and Eddie is off. The Game's afoot!As the story unfolds we learn of previous happenings in Valiant's life. We find out that his brother and partner in the Private I business was killed by a Toon in Toon Town, apparently the name for their section of Hollywood/L.A.The story unfolds like an artichoke, revealing a secretive world of crime, illicit sex and political corruption that would be the envy of Dashiel Hammett's Sam Spade, Raymond Chandler's Phillip Marlowe or the Robert Towne/Roman Polanski collaboration on CHINATOWN(1974).Like the meandering of a great river, the plot twists and turns wherein we finally have the answer to the Roger Rabbit's accused whodunnit, but also to the killing of Eddie Valiant's brother, who was_______________! No, that would definitely be a spoiler!The film succeeds on several levels. Obviously it is a great animated feature, and one surely unlike any that have gone before. Chances are there will be other efforts (like the very enjoyable Warner Brother/Looney Tunes/Merrie Melodies production of SPACE JAM(1996)starring Michael Jordan, Wayne Knight, Bill Murray, Charles Barkley, Bugs Bunny, Elmer Fudd, Sylvester, Tweety, Taz Devil, Foghorn Leghorn, et al......)It is also a very good spoof of the Hard Boiled Detective story or even the Film Noir genre that had gotten so popular during and (especially) after World War II. The sets, the costuming, hair styles,the fashions and the vintage autos made it very much of a period piece.So, no matter what, this WHO FRAMED ROGER RABBIT? was nothing special, I mean there's no deep meaning, no symbolism, no message-right? Well, I'm not so sure. Please, indulge me and check out what follows.Well, to begin with Eddie Valiant expresses a deep dislike for this certain group, these TOONS. His brother was killed by a TOON.

Unique movie that we will never see the like of again,"Hard drinking 1940's private eye Eddie Valiant finds himself caught up in another 'toon' case.What we have is a double tribute to Hollywood's golden era of animation and film making. It has a comic take on the hard-boiled, film noir detective story and is populated by both live-action human and cartoon characters.The story works superbly as a compelling mystery and hilarious comedy with both sharp dialogue and sight gags. There is more than a big nod to Roman Polansky's 'Chinatown' as Bob Hoskins' lead character laments over the tragic circumstances of his previous involvement in 'Toontown'.Hoskins is the perfect foil for the outrageously silly title character and the fantastic Christopher Lloyd steals most of the scenes he's in with an almost Alan Rickman-like deadpan performance as the primary antagonist. The inclusion of many Warner and Disney cartoon character cameos is wonderful and serves the main concept of Toontown perfectly.From a technical perspective it is a one off. You only have to google how it was made using layers and layers of hand-drawn, animation cells within the optical compositing process to just imagine how labour intensive it must have been.The reaction this had from an audience at the time I remember vividly as a child of the 80s. When I first saw the scene where Kathleen Turner's Jessica Rabbit sings and struts about the stage interacting with live action characters I thought I was watching actual magic being performed.Movie making has evolved so far now that visual spectacle is simply expected as part of the cinematic experience. The industry is built on the foundation of technology and expertise that can deliver it without too much difficulty. What puts 'Who Framed Roger Rabbit' up there with the likes of 'The Wizard of Oz' and 'Star Wars' is that it gave us something we hadn't seen before. What makes it particularly special is that we have never really seen anything like it since.Modern day audiences may not sense the magic the way I did as a child, but I still enjoy it at forty and so does my four year-old daughter watching with me.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

What more can you get from the movie as a four year old other than the crazy, funny cartoon characters?Now since I'm older, I've seen the movie many times and I realized why my parents ditched the movie the first time we saw it; there was a lot of language and violence in it and had some suggestive things in it. I found many of those parts pretty funny (like Baby Herman for instance. Some of the things that he did were pretty twisted :) ).Another thing that I loved about the movie was how they blended the real world with the cartoon world. They did an amazing job at that (and it was only the 80's before all that other advanced crap came in).It was a well done movie. This movie has been a part of my life for so long, it's unforgettable. And though I'm almost an adult, Roger's still my absolute favorite (and I still have the doll that I got more than ten years ago!). I would say that this movie is for BOTH adults and kids. The adults get the mystery and humor of it and the kids get the cartoons out of it (I would say Roger especially; he's more wackier and irrevolent than the other cartoons).To the reader: I would GREATLY recommend you see this movie if you haven't already. I give it ***** 5/5!!",,Anonymous,Animation
who framed roger rabbit,"Who framed roger rabbit is is one awesome film that is made for parents and for kids equally,it is also one of most unique films i saw and even if space jam came after this i still perfere this one since it has a better story but also in moments creepy vibe from our villain played by lloyd,it was great to see how animation parts and its characters blended in a human part of world and interaction between them was great to listen and to watch,film has a lot of referances to many old cartoons and it was nice to see them all together,simply said it was brilliant what they were able to make in 88 and it is still a must watch film for many generations",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
A real blast from the past,"After ""concerned"" parents groups(censors) succeeded in completely neutering television cartoons for adults(and for any child over the age of five), because ""they were on when children could be watching"", it was only natural that movies would eventually take up the slack (with highly varying degrees of success).""Roger Rabbit"" was probably the most successful attempt of bringing back the sophisticated wit and cartoon ""violence"" that earlier cartoons were famous for.I only hope that television can break the grasp of government imposed censorship and cartoons ""like the good old days"" could return.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
We'll never see one of these again,"The only really good movie to mix live actors and cartoons, this isn't just a cracking good story of corruption in the heart of a supposed dream-world, but it also pays an hommage to decades of animation. Mixing cartoons never seen before together (the duel between Donald and Daffy remains an absolute classic to be rewound and seen again forever and ever), the movie must have made a handful of animators of both Disney and Warner Brothers jerk a few tears, as the biggest stars of american animation of the forty's appear on screen and receive a human treatment. This really fantastic point of view is the reason I scored it a 9: the film dreams out loud, and allows us to picture a situation: what if the toons were actors, who have feelings, emotions and problems just like regular people? In the centre of this question is the show-stealer Roger Rabbit, who emerges as one of the most engaging animation characters created. But the real treat is seeing Bob Hoskins, who, accomplishing something never before seen, shares most of his screen time with a character which doesn't exist except on post-production. The movie turns out an incredible journey, far beyond the regular fare of animation movies, it will please all audiences. A victory of director Robert Zemeckis and everyone involved, this picture is an example of movie magic at work.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

A movie that for me just missed the mark.,"This movie had a rather good plot, had funny scenes involving some of my favorite cartoon characters and it just missed mainly because of one mistake. That mistake you ask? Making Roger Rabbit sound like he did, it had the annoying factor of Jar Jar Binks, but Roger was in the movie a lot more than even that annoyance. Bob Hoskins whom I usually say is not really starring role material actually turns in a fairly good performance, but he is overshadowed by Christopher Lloyd who is fantastic in his role as Judge Doom. The voice of Jessica Rabbit is also very well done. The plot has Roger framed of course and the only person that can help prove his innocence is a guy named Eddie, who quite frankly does not like cartoon characters all that much. What is behind the murder, and what crazy stuff will happen in Toon Town? All of this would have been so much better if Roger Rabbit was not apparently on crack. Still, it has a lot to offer, I am sure most kids can overlook how annoying Roger is, and they may even find him very funny, heck most kids laughed at Jar Jar. For me though, if they would replace his voice I would probably have given this movie a seven or eight.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation

A great comedy for the family.,"In this film, the iconic Roger Rabbit is charged with murder and will have to resort to a human detective who hates cartoons to prove his innocence. Directed by Robert Zemeckis and written by Jeffrey Price, the film features performances by Bob Hoskins and Christopher Lloyd, as well as the voices of Charles Fleischer and Lou Hirsch.This film did something that, until then, was extremely rare: put human actors interacting with animated characters. And this was done with quality and a welcome realism. I excused to say, I believe, that the cartoons are the strong dish of the film, as well as the countless comic situations they star in. Bob Haskins shone in his role, skillfully balancing a comic character who maintains, throughout most of the film, a serious and even grumpy attitude. Of course, his most angry phrases eventually turn him into something even funnier. Christopher Lloyd comes late but in excellent performance, as villain. Cold as ice, insensitive to no end, he gave life to a memorable character with personality traits worthy of a Nazi executioner. Among the cartoons, Roger Rabbit and his sculptural wife, Jessica, deserve all the highlight.This is a family film that will easily appeal to all ages. The bright colors of the cartoons are appealing, contrasting with the more serious environment of the ""real world"" and flesh and blood actors. The special, visual and sound effects are excellent. The costumes are good and help the public to locate the story around the forties. The soundtrack is good and the music sung by Jessica, a jazz classic ""Why don't You Do Right"", is memorable.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Generational Enjoyment,"""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"" is a classic. A test of a classic is if it maintains its relevance and/or excellence over time. In other words, it's not dated. I just watched it with my daughter who is roughly the same age I was when I first watched it over 30 years ago and the two of us enjoyed it equally. Although I felt like I failed as a father when she didn't recognize Yosemite Sam, Tweety Bird, Daffy Duck, and the other Looney Tunes characters.I remember first seeing it and being amazed that there could be such a crossover with cartoons and live people. There was ""Mary Poppins"" and maybe some others, but WFRR was even more innovative. It was funny, creative, and had a brilliant plot. I'm sure my daughter can watch this movie in 30 years with her own kids and they would enjoy it just the same.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Great Movie,"This is one of my favorite movies of all time. The animation is incredible, and the mixture between human and cartoon acting is wonderful. It is unique and fun for people of almost any age. Some of the language may not be suitable for young children, but that's not the point. Bob Hoskins does such a wonderful job, you can not even tell he's British in the film. Unless you happen to know that he is. The plot is very cartoon-ish, a man gets a safe dropped on his head. Then the rest of the movie is to try to figure out who did it. As the title suggests, you may think Roger did it, or was he framed? Take the journey through Toon Town and see what unfolds!",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Cute, But Doesn't Quite Make It","There are some really nice special effects in this part live action, part animation comedy about a detective (Bob Hoskins) who has to clear the name of a cartoon character (Roger Rabbit) accused of murder. The premise of the movie (an interesting one, I concede) is that cartoon characters (""toons"") are real beings of some sort with their own existence beyond the pen of the cartoonist, and who even have their own neighbourhood to live in (""Toon Town""). More than that, they can even interact with we humans. The live action and animation blend together quite nicely, and Bob Hoskins does a good job of playing Eddie Valiant - even managing to keep a straight face through most of it. (I really enjoyed the scenes in which Eddie Valiant drives an animated car.) So, why do I only rate it a 3?There's a lot of very predictable slapstick humour packed all the way through. It's funny at first but degenerates to boring after a while. There are long scenes which aren't very interesting but are apparently used to allow the ""toons"" to be shown off, which is, I admit, necessary to allow the viewer to get to know some of them. But that leads in to another problem. It's hard to get truly involved with this when the movie for the most part uses cartoon characters who are completely unknown to the viewer; created, apparently, only for this movie. Setting aside the plethora of minor ""toons,"" who is Roger Rabbit anyway? Jessica Rabbit? Baby Herman? The Weasels? We don't know any of these toons! Who framed Roger Rabbit? You want to know the truth? Who cares! I don't even know the guy! Now, if it were ""Who Framed Bugs Bunny"" then I'd be inclined to be rooting for this unjustly accused toon. And why wasn't it? A lot of familiar cartoon characters appeared in the movie - including beloved Bugs - so the producers obviously had permission to use them. Why not focus the movie around characters we know? To me, that would have made far more sense.My last concern is about the conflict (in my view) between the content and the target audience. I'm assuming this is meant as a family movie. (I watched it on Canada's Family Channel.) Given that, I was rather surprised when the disclaimer at the beginning of the movie said that it wasn't appropriate for younger children, and was rated PG. And - fair enough. The content is too mature for the average 7 or 8 year old. But the cartoon nature of the movie makes it rather dull viewing for anyone older than that. It would be OK if you were going to watch it with your kids, but apparently given the rating you're not really supposed to. So - who's supposed to watch this anyway?It's worth a look-see if only for the special effects and for Bob Hoskins good performance, but that's about all.",3.0,Anonymous,Animation
A movie for all time,"The older I've gotten, my taste in movies has changed a little, but my thirst for a G or PG-rated movie has never lessened.  And I probably owe a lot of that to this movie.

It's a movie I can watch over and over again (which I have), and I think you will too.  It's definately a picture for any age, and it will go down in media history as one of the greatest.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

I had to run out and get the DVD right away! It'll be one of our family favorites for years to come!",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
"A novel film for its' time, and marvelous entertainment","On the Special Edition DVD of ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"", one of the animators says he was talking to another animator in 1986, who told him, ""This movie is two years away and I'm scared right now."" The guy confessed he was too. And frankly, I don't blame them one bit, considering this was the first film to combine live action with animation, and in the eighties of all decades. One false move, this could have been worse than Plan Nine From Outer Space. Thankfully, they got Robert Zemeckis and Steven Spielberg behind this, who know how to make good, quality (and hit) films, and I don't think they could have made a better movie.Set in 1947 Hollywood, it deals with down-on-his-luck, hard-boiled private detective Eddie Valiant (Bob Hoskins, who does a great job, despite the fact that his British accent comes through once in a while) who is assigned by cartoon studio executive R.K. Maroon, to investigate Jessica Rabbit, the wife of one of his stars, Roger Rabbit, who is allegedly having an affair with the owner of Toontown, where all the cartoon characters (brand new and classic Disney ones) live, Marvin Acme. Valiant reluctantly accepts it because when he was younger, he and his brother Teddy, who lived to work in Toontown and help toons out, were on a case there and a toon dropped a safe on Teddy's head, killing him and leaving Eddie with a hopeless lack of sense of humor. Later, Roger is accused of murdering Marvin Acme over jealousy, and is sought by the eccentric Judge Doom (Christopher Lloyd, who follows one eccentric Zemeckis role, Doc Brown, with this one), who wants to put him in his special dip which kills toons. Convinced Maroon made a patsy out of him, Eddie helps Roger prove his innocence, and in the process, it turns out that it is Judge Doom who not only killed Acme, but is also the Toon who killed his brother.Now, Roger Rabbit is none too bright, and anybody who's seen the movie can vouch for this, but he proclaims when he asks Eddie Valiant to help him that he could never hurt anybody, and that too, should be obvious to anybody who's ever seen the movie. I can remember seeing the movie when I was seven or eight in the theaters and saying, ""I never saw a cartoon talk to a person before."" Which I'm sure everybody else thought too. But I can't recommend it enough for kids or adults because kids will love the enduring, lovable Roger and adults will appreciate the marvels of the movie, which were impossible before it, as well as appreciate how much hard work went into it.There was a book before this, Who Censored Roger Rabbit, in which they were comic strips not actors, it was set in present day and Roger and Jessica's marriage was fake like Bennifer. I also hear Roger wasn't as goofy in the book, so I prefer not to read it. Plus, he dies. Now, as lovable as Roger was in the film, if they'd killed him off in that, do you know how many angry parents would have written letters to the studio that they made their children cry? I love the movie, and that might ruin it for me.",,Anonymous,Animation
Brilliant production,"""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"" is more than just another comedy film. It is a film that the directors spent much time on combining real life people with animation. There is a murder of a R.K. Maroon (played by Alan Tilvern) in the animation world and Roger Rabbit (voice done by Charles Fleischer) only hope is the toon hating detective Eddie Valiant which is played by Bob Hoskins. Valiant must overcome his hatred for toons to protect Roger from Judge Doom (played by Christopher Lloyd) until he can solve the case of who committed the murder of Maroon. The theme of ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"" is one where the viewer is trying to solve the mystery too. The director keeps building on the scenes to reveal more and more information on who committed the murder.The theme also helps to identify why the person would want to murder Maroon. The director also uses the theme to keep the attention of the audience by making them part of the movie in solving the film. The director also uses the movie to show how something different can be used as blame for something. In this movie, the director uses the toons as blame because they are different than the humans in the way that they act and behave. The film is a great way to show how someone can be viewed and treated based on how they are different from others. In the film you will see that they are using camera angles to help tell parts of the story. For example, there is a scene where the director uses a downward shot to help show how going into the goo can be dangerous and hurt the toons. The music plays a vital role in this too as it gets more dramatic to make the viewer worry.""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"" is a great movie that used many different forms of art to combine human interaction with animation. However, there is meaning behind the story rather than making people laugh. The story will make a person think about why you would accuse someone for something without truly knowing if it was them that did the action.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Why I Love ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit?""","In ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit,"" which exists in an alternate 1947 Hollywood in which human beings coexist with cartoon characters (referred to throughout as ""Toons""), alcoholic private eye Eddie Valiant (Bob Hoskins) is put on the case of clearing a long-eared fugitive of the law, the titular Roger Rabbit (voiced by Charles Fleischer), of murder charges. Roger, the fun-loving Toon star of Maroon Cartoons, is married to a beautiful Toon woman, Jessica Rabbit, and Roger had become distraught that she may have been having an affair with his boss Marvin Acme (Stubby Kaye), and Acme himself later turns up dead, with Roger as the #1 suspect. As Eddie digs deeper and deeper into his investigation, he soon finds himself on the run and having to journey to Toontown (the home of all the Toons in Hollywood), one of the last places on Earth he wants to be for reasons I'll explain later. This was one of my favorite movies from my childhood (I was three when it was originally released), and it still is after happening upon a recent viewing of the picture, and I only recently discovered that it was not an original piece as I once believed, but it's adapted from the novel ""Who Censored Roger Rabbit?"" by Gary K. Wolf. Does that mean I love it any less? Of course not. It just gives me more room to appreciate what director Robert Zemeckis and screenwriters Jeffrey Price and Peter S. Seaman were able to do with the story. This movie is fantastic, especially with its mix of comedy, detective-noir, and good old-fashioned murder-mystery whodunit. It's also brilliant for its Oscar-winning special effects, which combine live-action with animation. That's been done before, but I've never seen it done with the care and precision as it's done in ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit."" The whole movie is like a dream, a dream where people can happily coexist with their favorite cartoon characters, rather than go to the theater for the on-screen antics. Judge Doom (Christopher Lloyd from Zemeckis's earlier ""Back to the Future"") is a classic movie villain, with his all-black fatigues, snarl, and typical bad-guy demeanor; there's also a unique twist with his character that you have to see to believe. Bob Hoskins is great as Eddie Valiant, in what is arguably his best-known American film role; growing up, I of course had no idea that he was actually British, but he pulls off his American accent perfectly. One of the things I really like about his character is the resentment he has toward Toons, since one killed his brother several years before this film's story takes place, and his attempts to clear Roger Rabbit of murder charges provides a foundation for him to overcome his hatred. (Am I the only one who spots the obvious parallels to racism here?) ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"" is a classic comedy/fantasy, and undoubtedly one of my favorite movies. As I stated earlier, a recent viewing allowed me to really see this movie's greatness all over again. I'm glad I'm still in love with it after all these years.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Simply remarkable; a fascinating and highly unique experience feeding off of familiar material, all of which combines into something really worthwhile.","Who Framed Roger Rabbit plays like a high scoring Masters thesis on the various aspects of the film noir genre via an edition of a Beano comic; a placing together of two wildly differing texts inside of a concentrated experiment tank beside lit ACME dynamite, the resultant explosion's remnants being what it is that splatters all over our film screens forming what is a dizzy array of colours and wonder which grabs us from the beginning and never lets up. American director Robert Zemeckis' 1988 film is a deliriously enjoyable noir in its most extremest of forms; a hardened example of cross pollination, further still feeding off of decades of inspiration and homage, just cascading together into something else totally out of the ordinary alá Sin City or Blade Runner, as decidedly postmodern generic fabrications thrust together. Despite the hallmarks of creativity, the film is never preoccupied with its hook; going on to formulate an impressive and really quite affecting character study in amidst a narrative that is challenging; never overbearing and never thinks of its audience as idiots.The film follows a lowly, dishevelled private investigator named Eddie Valiant (Hoskins); a man living off of the reputation he has in solving mysteries that he did so effectively in the days during which his now deceased brother was still alive and working with him. The film wastes little time in constructing Valiant as the embittered lead he is, the hitching of unpaid rides on the rear carts of trams to get around town and the swigging of hard alcohol straight out of the bottle at whatever chance he gets when alone the norm; whereas down at a local bar, a one-time relationship with a waitress that might have gone somewhere, but has now mutated into that of quick acquaintances, the closest he has to a friend. By night, we see him attend an upmarket club that is putting on a comedy double act – where everyone else sees the funny side, Valiant is too indebted to his cynicism to even break a smile.Valiant is a living embodiment of a generic convention if ever there was one, but played with the sorts of creativity and wonder operating around him so much so that we enjoy seeing this familiarised core archetype at the centre of such a premise. He despises those with whom he exists; despises them for that one of them was involved in the death of that aforementioned brother, and the grudge has stuck. Those of whom he exists with are ""toons""; cartoon characters literally walking, talking and existing with the humans within this world of 1947 Los Angeles - a breaking of a reality so shocking, that the film distills how we react through that of its lead when Valiant himself exclaims upon the first instance of that 'wall' being broken.'Toons seem bound to serving that of the humans to some degree, be it in the form of waiting on tables; acting as doormen; barmen or even, in the case of Disney's famous elephant lead Dumbo, an acting talent for a major film studio - one wonders what role it might be possible for Dumbo to play besides that of Dumbo. Director Zemeckis gets all the fun of the fair out of these ideas, accommodating various 'toons to professions that suit their characteristics, in that an exceptionally large gorilla is a doorman; an octopus is able to work several orders at once behind the bar and animated penguins make for waddling waiters serving customers.In the grandest of noir traditions, corruption where there really ought not be any, is afoot; Christopher Lloyd's local judicial chief, aptly named Doom, and his team of 'toon weasel assistants form the film's source of conflict. Doom's arrival, clad all in black and with a walking stick plus-limp creating a false sense of harmlessness, is via a canted angle as Valiant peers upwards at him; an apparent oneupmanship already underway as Doom incorrectly entrusts to have caught Valiant in an act. Doom and his team are scouring the city for the titular Roger Rabbit following the belief he murdered a film producer. His 'toon wife Jessica, uniquely sporting human-like characteristics away from those of an anthropomorphic nature, was involved with this producer but it is a crime Roger maintains he did not commit. In crying out to Valiant for help, in turn offering him the chance to put to bed his 'toon-hating ways and going back on a case he'd only previously had taken with his brother whose death still resonates, the fun that is Who Framed Roger Rabbit kicks off.Where a lot of noir's tone is born out of post-war disillusionment, the two very different inflections of Valiant and Roger clash head-on in a physical sense when the lead finds himself working with him, a raucous 'toon whom cannot help but exclaim loudly and proudly at whatever chance he gets, making for great humour when in danger, and yet stands in stark binary opposition to that of Valiant's more downcast stature eventually making for excellent comedy and drama. Zemeckis deals with everything wonderfully well, using such a concept to act as a backdrop to intelligent film-making and utilising such a notion to formulate wondrous comedy in what is a thoroughly enjoyable and surprisingly smart comedy; a film that rocks along without letting up for a second. From its audacious opening to its familiar finale of good vs. evil fighting one on one, only with a total overhaul of creativity and mirth via the dizzy array of ideas the screenwriters are permitted to work with given the setting, the film is at once wholly rich in detail between animation and live-action; funny for people of most ages; arrives with a real sense of threat and danger maintaining drama and generally instills a good feeling.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

"Colorfully frantic, with every human and 'toon vying for their share of the laughs...","A cartoon rabbit is framed for murder and seeks the help of a human gumshoe to solve the case. Director Robert Zemeckis admirably, seamlessly managed to bring together live-action and old-school animation with this 1940's slapstick tale set mostly in Hollywood, but the screenplay, adapted from Gary Wolf's book, seems to have gotten lost in the mad rush to fill the picture with every eye-popping visual trick the filmmakers could come up with. There's enough color here to fill ten pictures (with energy to spare), but the plot is so weak it's eventually rendered negligible, and all the pushing and shouting (from both the main players and the newly-created animated characters) is literally exhausting. Many Walt Disney and Warner Bros. cartoon favorites pop up in cameos, and it's certainly a treat to see them sharing the screen, but without a strong story-framework to make everybody's time worthwhile, the movie just becomes a frantic trip down memory lane--with no rest-stops. ** from ****",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
Cannot get enough of that couple!!  An absolute 10 in my book!,"I first saw this wonderful movie on Sunday, February 19,1989 in theaters as a twelve year old. I have once owned the movie on VHS and seen it...  Let me put it this way, I have worn the tape out so much that I had to get it on Laser Disc.  This movie is set in 1947 in L.A. and Toontown (the home of all beloved cartoon characters).  I'm sure that you have read the previous ones and know what this little gem is about, but I'll go ahead and give you a little bit of the story...  Eddie Valiant (private detective) hasn't had a case in YEARS...  Until R.K. Maroon (Roger's boss) gives him the task of taking pictures of his star's wife playing patty cake (literally) with Marvin Acme (owner of the company that gives Wile E. Coyote headaches). Eddie shows Roger the pictures, Roger gets fumed and leaves the office. The next day, Marvin Acme has been found murdered in his factory and the evidence points to Roger...  That's all I'm going to tell.  I'll let you find out for yourselves.  Jessica Rabbit, (Roger's Rabbit's wife) is a human toon WOMAN.  Maybe an odd couple, but they seriously love and adore each other.  I REALLY love this film and it will always be #1 in my heart.  I'm really saddened that there will be no more cartoons and movies of this beloved couple :( (that's why I went to see Honey, I Shrunk The Kids; Dick Tracy; and A Far Off Place!)  I was looking forward to new cartoons of Roger, Jessica and Baby Herman (and hopefully more appearances of Benny the Cab), but I guess I'll have to settle for what's already done.  It's a shame such a fresh idea has to be omitted slowly by time.  I think that the actors did a FANTASTIC JOB.  Who else can pull this off besides imaginative children?  GREAT IMAGINATIVE ACTORS!!  I have both books- Who Censored Roger Rabbit (loved it) and Who P-P-P-Plugged Roger Rabbit(some questions, but entertaining.)  I loved these characters so much that I am in the process of writing about them.  I won't share details!  Thanks Gary Wolf for bringing these 'Toons into my life!

After discovering the will that Acme has supposedly never wrote, he wraps up the case of the real murder crime and has Toontown bequeathed to the toons.

"Finally a ""cartoon"" for adults","""Who Framed Roger Rabbit?"" is not an exercise in exciting murder mystery. The plot is generally unexciting and unoriginal. But all it needs to be is enough to give this ground- breaking mixture of animation and live action room to reach it's potential -- enough to make sure all the cartoon/human jokes could be made and all the muscles of the technology flexed. That's what makes ""Roger Rabbit"" fascinating the whole way through. You're almost left intrigued only to see if they're going to be able to pull it off the whole movie.Roger Rabbit is a Bugs Bunny rip-off who in this world is a working actor that has a trouble- making reputation. When a toon-film mogul named R.K Maroon wants to send a message to Roger to get his act together, he hires a P.I named Eddie Valiant, the film's whiskey-swilling film noir-esquire protagonist, to follow Roger's red-headed bombshell (and animated) wife, Jessica, who might be having an affair with the head of ACME, the man who owns Toon- Town -- where everything animated lives. When Roger learns of Jessica's ""affair,"" it's not long before he's framed for ACME's murder. Valiant reluctantly befriends the rabbit and takes his case.One of the impressive things about the film is it obtained rights to both Warner Bros. and Disney characters. There are countless appearances and part of the fun is picking out which characters are from what. It's a tribute to the world of cartoons by projecting how cartoon characters would act if they were real. That's much of the humor right there of this inventive film. There's a unique cartoon-induced style to all the jokes, fusing the world of live action and 2D brilliantly together. It's in this spirit that a film like ""Roger Rabbit"" works and that a film just putting the two together for visual effect falls short.It's also a film for adults. A child would get some of the hijinx, but it's definitely not an appropriate kids film. It comes from the adult perspective on cartoons and plays off the maturity of an audience that grew up loving cartoons.The only thing the movie lacks other than a bit more of a creative plot structure is good acting. Christopher Lloyd is always a fan favorite (he skyrocketed director Robert Zemeckis' previous film ""Back to the Future""), but Bob Hoskins is not leading man material. He's great at interacting with nobody (after all, most of his scenes take place with actors that were drawn in later), but there's the charm of star power missing from the film other than cameos by Mickey Mouse and Bugs Bunny.""Roger Rabbit"" is a classic in the sense that nothing else is like it and anything that's tried hasn't been as clever. Robert Zemeckis has made a career reinventing the way we see movies and this late 80s film marked just the beginning.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Becareful you may laugh yourself to death,"Who Framed Roger Rabbit is a wonderful fantasy comedy directed by Robert Zemeckis (Back to the Future (1985), Mars Needs Moms (2011), Real Steel (2011) and Flight (2012))and done by Spielberg's Amblin Studios and Disney's Touchstone pictures. It combines live action and animation in a blend that made it match up to the fit of Disney's Mary Poppins which till date is Disney's most Oscar nominated film and it went home with 5 wins. Like Mary Poppins live action and animation combination that came out grand, so did this, although unlike Mary Poppins, where the animation and the characters hardly interact, in this movie they seem to be always around each other.This interaction was so well done that you have to give kudos to the animators and animation directors.The movie plot is about a cartoon star Roger Rabbit whose wife was caught on camera by a P.I. Eddie Valiant (Bob Hoskins) playing pattycake with another man. That man soon ends up dead and Roger is being accused for the murder. Now Roger has no hope but to run to the toon hating P.I. Eddie who took the pictures in the first place, now both are stuck together as they try to figure out why someone will be trying to frame Roger Rabbit.The screenplay is written by Jeffrey Price and Peter S. Seaman (who also worked together on Dr' Seuss screenplay adaptation of How The Grinch Stole Christmas (2000)) and is based on Gary K. Wolf's 1981 novel named Who Censored Roger Rabbit? Both book and movie depict a world in which cartoon characters interact directly with human beings.Who Framed Roger Rabbit won 4 Oscars and it was a critical acclaim, many enjoyed the comic and the fun story the movie carries and at the time of its production it was one of the most expensive animations ever made. Its production cost was 70 million dollars and it was a box office success making over 320 million in its time of release.In conclusion, Who Framed Roger Rabbit is a classic animation from the 80s that all should get the chance to see even if it is just once. Talks are going about that Disney is in talks with Amblin (Steven Spielberg) and even director Robert Zemeckis to make a sequel to this fine film, although Bob Hoskins has retired from acting, I feel that the writers can still come up with something we all want to see.www.lagsreviews.com",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Impressive but not emotionally engaging,"I'm a classic-animation fan... and have been professionally involved in the technical side of computer graphics for a long time.I found Roger Rabbit to be impressive... innovative in the technical and production sense for its time. (It wasn't the first interaction between cartoon characters and live action, however; not by a long shot. Winsor McCay did that way back in 1914 with his live-stage + filmed production of ""Gertie the Dinosaur"".)However, although I found Roger Rabbit to be technically impressive, I also found it somewhat boring and silly. The characters and plot just weren't emotionally engaging for me, which isn't something I can explain, it's totally subjective. I just didn't care about them the way I cared about (for example) Pinocchio or Daffy Duck (such as in Duck Amuck).Also, although I was impressed with the tech/production side for its time (late 1980's), I simultaneously experienced the interaction of cartoon and live characters as jarring and unconvincing, actually a distraction from the story, rather than an enhancement of it. Again, totally subjective reaction.",2.0,Anonymous,Animation
Who you calling a chump? You chimp!,"I love Who Framed Roger Rabbit! The characters are well done and even the weasels are funny.Roger Rabbit gets into trouble when he becomes framed for a murder he didn't even commit and on top of that he has also found out that his wife played patty cake with Marvin Acme.Eddie Valiant a private investigator who has done work for helping solve crimes for toons along with his brother who was tragically killed by one, gets more than he bargained for when Roger comes and asks for his help. Along the way they find out that an evil toon killed Acme for profit to take over the red car and destroy toontown to build a mega freeway. And it also turns out that this villain was the one who killed Eddie's brother.Sometimes Roger Rabbit gets a little immature with it's material and shouldn't be viewed by younger children.

Hasn't Aged A Day,"This film greatly exceeded my expectations. I've heard that it's a technical milestone in films but I did not expect it to stand up and still look amazing over 30 years on. I can't even believe the amount of work that's gone into creating this film, even the tiny details like paper moving when a toon sits on a stack or even the shadows cast on them to make them go from looking like a novelty to something that not only looks impressive but real within the world. Furthermore, the script and the directing was very much on point, with tiny details in the background or clever puns that take a second to realise, leading to some genuine belly laughs at points. Furthermore it is a very good mystery, with clues red hearings and a satisfying reveal at the end, which was all masterfully directed by Zemeckis.

"One of those movies that gets better and better with each viewing; empowered by a single, reiterating question: how did they do it?","""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"" is one of those movies that gets better and better with each viewing. It amazed me the first time I saw it; it amazed me even more the second and wait eagerly for my third encounter with this dazzling little wonder of a movie. Apart from being wonderful entertainment, it is also a first-class example of Hollywood's greatest special effects done with purposeful and pleasing imagination. It's also a movie that you will find yourself going back to many times not merely because it is so endlessly entertaining, but to try and answer a question you find yourself asking over and over again as you watch it: how did they do it?The movie is (very) loosely based on a book by Gary Wolf called ""Who Censored Roger Rabbit."" For the film version, directed by Robert Zemeckis, the setting is changed to Hollywood, 1947, in an imaginary alternative where humans and animated cartoon characters exist together in the movie business. Bob Hoskins stars as an alcoholic gumshoe with a grudge against toons who is hired to investigate the activities of a cartoon star named Roger Rabbit. When the owner of the town where the toons live is found murdered and Roger Rabbit is framed, the gumshoe finds himself reluctantly teeming up with him to try and solve the case, which becomes much more complex than one might expect from a movie blending live action with animation.The first impression I got was that this movie would be directed at kids, but it is actually more fun for adults. Partially because of some dark undertones, but mostly because adults can really appreciate the craftsmanship and will wonder the most on how the filmmakers could have done it. Of course, this was not the first time animation was combined with live action, but this was the first time it had been done so effectively. For example, when a cartoon character steps on a floorboard, the (live-action) floorboard squeaks. When a toon touches a coat, the (live-action) coat moves. When they pick up a gun, the (live-action) gun moves. The camera is constantly in motion; the shadows are ever-present. And no matter how hard you look, you can't spot any wires or strings or operators and you find yourself wondering if that was even how it was done.That's the magic of ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit."" Not merely because the special effects are good, but because they are done with the intent of amazing and befuddling the audience. You can guess how about half of the special effects were done. You'll probably be right about half the time there. And as for the other half, you can't even guess. And at the same time, you don't want to know because it's more fun to wonder.However, there is much more here to give people reason to see the movie. Mr. Zemeckis was reportedly given more than 40 scripts to choose from and chose one that is complex, whimsical, funny, imaginative, and nostalgic. The plot is much darker and more complex that you'd expect, the jokes are not the typical below-the-belt humor we usually get, the writing is witty and sharp, and every gag delivers a laugh. Furthermore, the casting choice as far as the humans go is solid. The great Bob Hoskins plays his role like a straight man and not a comical figure trying to upstage his animated costars. There are many other great choices as well, but most entertaining is that the movie has one of the most fun villains in cinema history. Christopher Lloyd gives one of his performances as a sardonic, gargoyle-like judge who is both fearsome and yet strangely entertaining at the same time.Some of the animated characters are new, but many come from our childhood memories. Different characters from different studios make their way into the film. Some of which haven't been seen on the screen in years, such as Betty Boop, who was last seen in 1939. A personal favorite scene of mine is where Donald and Daffy Duck have a little piano square-off. Not only is the combination of animated characters and live-action pianos seamless, but it is handly exremely well and the nostalgia that was bubbling through my conscience was intoxicating.Perfectly matched to Director Zemeckis and produced by passionate souls such as Steven Spielberg, ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"" is a first-class example of entertainment. Hollywood rarely even finds the nerve to try and attempt a movie like this anymore, but we are so appreciative of them when they do.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Timeless classic,"This movie is one of my favourite pictures of all time. I got into animation mainly because of this film. Not only is the animation the best that you'll ever see, the story as well is incredibly well. In my film school, in screenwriting class,  we saw this film as an illustration of how to write a good movie script. Even though it is not the first live action/cartoon cross-over, it is by far the best you'll ever ever see. No-one will ever come close to what director Bob Zemeckis and his cast and crew did in the movie genre.I was 9 years old when this film came out. When my mother took me to the theater I actually wanted to see Rambo III but wasn't allowed. So we went to see Who Framed Roger Rabbit. I literally stayed on my seat after the film was over to watch the next screening of it.(I don't think that's possible anymore in theaters nowadays...)I didn't hear my mother complain.Other films have been made using the same techniques, like Space Jam and Osmosis Jones. Even those two films together are peanuts next to Roger Rabbit. It would be like comparing 'Dungeons & Dragons'(the movie) and 'Dragonheart II' with 'The Fellowship of the Ring'.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
An Entertaining Movie,"Toon star Roger is worried that his wife Jessica is playing pattycake with someone else, so the studio hires detective Eddie Valiant to snoop on her.

I'm not really a fan of those old cartoon characters and all of that. I was right. The beginning starts off slow but it definitely picks up, which surprised me! This film is entertaining and very good with its cartoon and human interactions!Another thing I like about this film is the multiple cartoon characters showing up in the film like Mickey, Daffy, Betty, etc... although I have to say there really isn't anything special about this film.

Wacky Rabbit,"Well Roger Rabbit is a humorous film and I did like it but not as much as I used to.

That is something I wanted to see when I was a kid - some sort of duel between the two hot-headed famous ducks.

Maltese Falcon meets Looney Tunes,"Who Framed Roger Rabbit is a live action animated movie directed by Robert Zemeckis. The film takes place in 1947 during the golden age of Hollywood. The film centers on alcoholic detective named Eddie Valiant, who is tasked to take pictures of Roger Rabbit's wife Jessica Rabbit, but soon becomes involved in a conspiracy. And what we have here is Maltese Falcon meets Looney Tunes. I know that the filmmakers were inspired by other neo-noir films, but as I noticed some similarities between the two. And it also doesn't feel like they were trying too hard to make it the next Maltese Falcon either, but instead borrow themes from the Maltese Falcon, and other neo-noir detective films and transform it into a family friendly film. If someone were to ask me what the definition of a live action animated film is, I will tell them to go watch this. This movie does a perfect job of blending live action with animation, without making it feel awkward or creepy at the same time. Robert Zemeckis chose to do hand drawn animation rather than computer animated because he wanted to make this feel more natural. Also at the time this was one of the most expensive films to make, but it shows that with hard work you can create a beautiful film. And this proves that not all animated movies have to be computer animated, which I feel is what animation is all about now. I wish that they were more animated films like this because there are so many animated styles out there that haven't had their turn to shine. I will say that my one little flaw would be the ending. Even though this is a terrific film, the ending to me felt a little rushed like they almost ran out of time. So in the end, I would say take a break from the current animated films, and instead enjoy a different animated film for everyone.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

"Perfectly over the top,  just like any good cartoon should be...","It's rare to have such a high profile production that keeps the appeal of a cult classic, and even more rare to have a movie come out with such hype that actually lives up to our expectations.  The visual effects are excellent, and the story is a prime lampoon of the classic film noir private detective stories of the time...in short, it works! Hoskins is great as our troubled gumshoe, Cassidy does her tough-as-nails Tess Trueheart best as his girl, Christopher Lloyd as Doom is almost more of a cartoon than the cartoons are... perfectly over the top, as always.  Kathleen Turner turns out a sultry femme fatale worthy of Barbara Stanwyck, and manages to keep that heart of gold hidden (beneath that bosom, how difficult can it be?)... And, of course, there's Roger, voiced by the remarkable Charles Fleischer (who also voiced Benny the Cab, Greasy and Psycho).  No one but Fleischer could have played this character!

This was the first movie that I ever saw in the theaters.,"When I was four years old, some friends took me to the movie theater. Eventually, I realized that there was a character named Roger Rabbit, but I kept wondering why they didn't show more of him. Also, I interpreted that there was a place called ""the studios"", that someone tried to put Roger Rabbit in some soup, and that at one point, a bunch of characters popped up and started singing. But overall, I didn't understand what the movie was about.A few years later, I rented a movie, and realized that it was the same one that I had seen in the theaters. I was now able to understand the plot: Roger Rabbit is framed for murder, and he hires detective Eddie Valiant (Bob Hoskins) to clear him. In the process, Eddie discovers that this all relates to his past. ""The studios"" were Maroon Studios, the ""soup"" was Dip, and the characters popping up and singing was the scene where Eddie drives into Toontown.""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"" is a most impressive movie. There had been mixtures of live action and animation before, but this brought it to a new level. One of my favorite scenes was when Daffy Duck and Donald Duck were playing ""Hungarian Rhapsody"" on the pianos and undermining each other's performances.Anyway, this is a most formidable accomplishment, fun for everyone in every way.

Never a dull moment with this one!,"""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"" is a delight! The film is visually stimulating, quite funny, and innovative in its approach to live-action/animation hybrid sequences. I found that to be really cool, especially for a film of its time. The story is engaging too, with unpredictable turns and quirky, endearing (human) characters you would expect from an animation, but their depiction doesn't seem out of place in this context. Even though I wasn't familiar with all the characters, and some references were a bit lost on me, I enjoyed seeing characters from different franchises interact on screen. I thought the movie would be rated higher than PG, given the number of mature themes touched on. However, I really enjoyed this, and I'd see it again.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Not thinking four-dimensionally,"Zemeckis is a tricky director.  He wants to be a comedy director, but like Donner, he tries having comedy by fusing it with other elements.In the 'Future' movies it was the sci-fi/time-travel concept (in 'Part III' he added the paper-thin western genre).  In 'Death' it was a Burton/Hitchcock idea.  With 'Gump', American history/sentimentality.  Here he tries a cartoon/noir/comedy and goofs it up.Perhaps he became too good so he went on to the weaker efforts 'Contact', 'What Lies...', and 'Cast Away'.Why does it fail?  Maybe the first problem lies with the script, after all 'The Grinch' and 'Wild Wild West' weren't the brightest of efforts.  Arthur Schmidt knows Zemeckis, and his editing isn't bad because it knows the pace. Charles Campbell's sounds and Dean Cundey's photography are right, so what's wrong?I'd say it's the environment.  We never accept the noirish settings of Beverly Hills and toon town, so it doesn't fit our expectations.  It's a lot like Spielberg and 'Hook'.Despite these shortcomings, I find Zemeckis more interesting (and efficient) than less creative directors Chris Columbus and Ron Howard.Final Analysis = = Cinematic Dud",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

Fortunately, you can cross that off the list too... along with a superlative performance by a much-missed Bob Hoskins, who was obviously acting against thin air most of the time.

"A live action/cartoon crossover which may not be as good as its reputation suggests, but is still a decent comedy/crime adventure","This innovative live action/traditional animation crossover was a massive success, released back when I was just under two years old, but I don't recall ever even hearing of it until 2005, around the time I first saw 2003's ""Looney Tunes: Back in Action"", another live action/cartoon crossover, which I really hated! I watched that film's predecessor, ""Space Jam"", for the first time last year and found it to be hit-and-miss, and then watched the 2003 Looney Tunes film again, which I didn't think was as bad the second time, but still below average. I had high expectations for ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"" when I rented it this year, still having never seen it before, and it didn't turn out to be as good as I thought it would be, but still better than both Looney Tunes movies.In 1947, in a world where cartoon characters are real beings, interacting with live humans, acting out cartoons in front of the camera, and living in a place near Hollywood called Toontown, Roger Rabbit is a popular cartoon character who hasn't been doing so well on set lately. This is because it is believed that his human cartoon wife, Jessica, might be cheating on him. A bitter detective named Eddie Valiant is hired to investigate. He sees Jessica playing patty-cake with Toontown owner Marvin Acme and takes pictures. Roger is very upset when he learns about this. Soon after he finds out, Marvin is found murdered, and Roger is the prime suspect! At the scene of the crime, Eddie meets Judge Doom, who is with his Toon Patrol of cartoon weasels, and has created a substance which can kill cartoon characters! The detective soon finds the cartoon rabbit hiding in his office/apartment. Roger claims he is innocent, and Eddie finds himself reluctantly helping him, trying to clear his name and find the real culprit!The beginning of this film shows Roger Rabbit shooting a cartoon with fellow cartoon character Baby Herman. With this intro, it's off to a promising start, but soon after this cartoon sequence ends, the film goes downhill for a while. I'm not exactly sure why, but there were parts I found pretty dull, mostly early in the film. There were times when I laughed at this point, but maybe not enough. I also wasn't sure what I thought of Judge Doom, played by Christopher Lloyd. However, I later found that the 1988 blockbuster improves again, maybe starting with the part where Eddie finds Roger hiding in his bed. This leads to a lot of funny chaos in the room, including Roger and Eddie handcuffed together, and Eddie having to hide Roger under the sink water when the Toon Patrol come in! Many big laughs follow, with the title character's antics and such, and in addition to the humour, there's also a lot of suspense in the story. Being a live action/cartoon crossover, the film's cast features both live actors and voice actors, and both of these are generally good here. The blend of live action and animation was also done very well for this film. ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"" is a little overlong, which I really found during the climax, but this is not enough to ruin the movie.Before watching this, I knew that even though it was considered a family movie, it certainly wasn't squeaky clean. There is some sexuality, much of it involving Jessica Rabbit, with her cleavage and risqué moves, and there's also some mild language and some scenes which little kids could find too scary. It's one of those films that people might debate over whether it's REALLY a family film or not. Unlike some people, I never saw it as a kid, so I don't know what that would have been like. People can keep debating over whether kids should watch ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"" or not, but it seems to have entertained many of them (maybe mostly older ones) in the past 22 years. Many adults clearly like it as well, perhaps largely for different reasons than kids. After watching it, I don't think it's the amazing piece of entertainment that so many other people claim it is, but it still gets my recommendation.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Too adult for kids, too dull for adults","This film has 299 reviews on IMDB as I write mine, so I won't spend much time on the plot. I saw this in the theater when it came out, I imagine based on reviews by Siskel and Ebert. They raved about the wonderful blending of cartoon characters and real people and how the script created this world where ""Toons"" live and interact with people, with the Toons behaving like their film characters-you can drop a piano on them and they are unharmed, etc.The idea sounded neat but the film had some huge problems. It started with an actual cartoon to introduce the star, Roger Rabbit, who incredibly was left to babysit for an actual baby, despite him having no skills at this whatsoever. Before you know it, the baby is destroying the house like a one-man Three Stooges, and doing several things to Roger, by accident, as the baby is trying to get to some out-of-reach cookies, that if done to a real person would have killed him three or four different ways.One example: Roger gets flung into an oven that the baby accidentally dials past the highest temperature to a setting called ""Volcano."" And he is depicted as being left in there long enough that when he is finally sent flying out of the oven, he looks like a big lump of charcoal. Too extreme to be funny.Throughout the film Roger is nothing but annoying. He wasn't likeable or funny and although I didn't want to see him killed by the many evil characters trying to, he just wasn't a character we wanted to care about.There is excessive foul language in here, and a great many sexually suggestive scenes and dialogue. I believe I would have been embarrassed to have taken my kids to see this, had I such a chance. It's not mildly suggestive, but quite blatant, and there are enough to make this more than annoying to a parent.Roger is married to a cartoon woman named Jessica. She is drawn in such a way as to suggest her ""measurements"" are 42""-7""-32."" Virtually the whole movie, she is wearing a shoulder-less dress that barely has her breasts halfway covered, and it is rather creepy to see the real-life actors seemingly staring at her breasts and getting aroused. I'm not kidding-this happens. They even have some male figure reaching into the top of her dress and pulling out some object, with the quip being that it was a ""booby trap.""Oh they do have short clips of many famous old cartoon characters from their old films so I guess that was a plus. But most of them are on screen for about 8 seconds and don't have time to say or do anything funny.This mingling of real and cartoon is the only real reason to watch this film. Sort of like folks before my time in the 1950s went to see films in 3-D for a while, before realizing that the movies made in 3-D were so lame they weren't worth seeing. Top film producers felt this effect would distract people from a good film, so they didn't film any of their expected big hits that way.To anyone reading this who liked this Roger Rabbit movie, I put it to you this way: Had they made this just the way they did except with ALL the characters animated, would you still think it's a good movie? Good enough to rate higher than the 4 I give it?",4.0,Anonymous,Animation
A revolutionary achievement.,"This is not just a movie, it's a miracle!How these cartoon characters interact with living human actors is just mind-blowing in how seamless they go together.

And the entertainment value is high and can satisfy both fans of detective/murder mystery movies and cartoon enthusiasts like myself.And this may be the only time we see the big names in animation putting their rivalry aside to make one hell of a ride with all their well known and beloved characters like Mickey Mouse, Donald Duck, Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck and the list goes on.

Film Review: Who Framed Roger Rabbit,"Even though the title has poor grammar, the film itself is decent. It made me uncomfortable in some places as a female toon easily seduces human males, and the whole film is basically her being a man magnet.

"Ahhh, what a heartbreakingly beautiful touchstone in my life...","This movie means so much to me.WHO FRAMED ROGER RABBIT was an extremely important event in my personal lifetime.I was one of those who had seen in-development clips of the original ROGER RABBIT movie on The Disney Channel back in 1984 (which looked totally different in many ways), and I had thought for the longest time that it had been left for dead until it was rescued by Robert ""Back The The Future"" Zemeckis (I deliberately write his name that way because that is exactly how the press printed his name every time they mentioned him during this movie's run, so much so that I was making jokes with friends about how Zemeckis must have recently made ""Back To The Future"" his legal middle names. But I digress).This movie came out just before I was ready to turn twenty years old that September. And as I watch it now, I still love it every bit as much as I did back then, only now it also brings tears to my eyes due to its representation to me at the time.1988. We cartoonists growing up were all being mocked and told we had no futures ahead of us. I was being called by my peers an ""animation hippie"". I had grown up studying to enter the animation industry and had dreams of joining Disney to use the power of the animated cartoon to spread positive vibes and happiness around the world just as Walt used to do, and maybe even save lives. And I had spent all my youth and later my teen years feverishly studying animation and teaching myself technique, preparing myself for the big moment. I had been talking my entire life about how one day there would be a revolution in the animation industry; Hollywood's marketing eggheads would finally be overthrown, animation would one day once again belong to the people. We in the animation industry would finally have the freedom and respect as everyone else did throughout the world in our same field; we would overcome and make animation ours again, unshackling it from the hands of the greedy bosses and worms of Hollywood.I genuinely and honestly believed that.And for me, ROGER RABBIT made 1988 my 1968 animation-wise. I sat there with my long-haired, tye-dyed idealism clutching my projects and beloved cartoon icons of the past to my heart as I had cheered ROGER RABBIT on and watched it steamroll Hollywood into being forced to take animation seriously as all-ages entertainment. I saw it countless times in the theatres. Again and again and again. This was it, I had been telling friends. This was the beginning of The Revolution! WHO FRAMED ROGER RABBIT was my Woodstock, the huge party promising the turning point of historical culture forever and the official beginning of hoped-for dreams for change and happiness.I was so naive and innocent back then.Well, as we all know and as I discovered when I finally made my first sojourn to Hollywood, ROGER RABBIT did make it officially cool to love animation again in this country with all ages, but Hollywood... characteristically... refused to relinquish control to the animators as I had predicted. Instead, they allowed a ""carefully marketed"" version of ""hip"" new cartoons to merely cash in on the new craze. And they ran it into the ground. Now they are doing the same thing with computer animation, stupidly believing that it's the technology making hit films and not the scripts. Same old, same old. And I ended up learning a hard lesson about how Hollywood leeches art for profit, how only individuals like Walt can truly cause revolutions. And to add insult to injury, we would later get our own knock-to-reality disaster as another attempt at a ""Roger Rabbit"" move hideously trashed and ended up accidentally mocking that hope in the way that The Rolling Stones' Altamont attempt had with Woodstock, in the form of Ralph Bakshi's COOL WORLD.But even so, despite its being a disappointment as a now-shattered idealism in my life and it's now representing what *could* have been (and now just to me either, I must add!), I still love this film to pieces. The technology is beautiful and it's so enjoyable that it actually breaks my heart even further to admit what I'm about to say. And that is that while it's such a wonderful film to me both personally and artistically, it is technically also a very lousy one.Even since I saw it for the first time, several things nagged at me right from the beginning. Fortunately, the movie was still so fun that I was able to overlook them. But here are the things which bothered me:First of all, I'm afraid that Richard Williams just isn't one of my favourite directors and I honestly wish they had gotten someone else to do it. His draftsmanship is simply too elastic and too undisciplined for the animation to read properly or have genuine physical appeal on screen. As a result the characters all have an unlikeable ""rubbery"" look that I find unattractive.Second, I'm still irked at the decision to try to design the characters ""painstakingly"" to appear the way they did draft-wise back during the era where this film takes place (especially when they aren't consistent about it with all the characters, or sometimes even the same character in different scenes!). I personally would have picked a more modern-era like the 60s or 70s (the book itself took place in modern times) so as to assure better character design appeal, but the marketers were so desperate to make the film timeless that they didn't want to take chances.Third, the draftsmanship of many of the classic characters is simply awful. As a review of a ""Roger Rabbit"" catalogue book once sold at that time put it, Williams couldn't draw a lot of these characters ""to save his soul"". How true. Many look passable enough, but they are ultimately undone by the director's own personal drawing style.And fourth--and this is probably my biggest complaint--the story. It shows lots of interaction with cartoon  characters physically, but there is barely *ANY* emotional or personal interaction with them! The true ideas of humans encountering cartoon characters are blunted as a result as Zemeckis simply waters it all down to a simple piece of ""laughter is so important to us all!"" tripe, and I have yet to see anyone make a serious attempt to have genuinely deep, personal emotional interaction between toons and people (something I've worked at with all my own stories and ideas throughout my life... am I the only artist out there who sees possibilities in this concept? I used to think everyone else did too, but now I seriously wonder). I keep hoping that someday someone besides myself will be able to make the attempt on the big screen and do it convincingly.But those four things aside, I still love this movie. How can I not? It's not just a spectacular piece of work, it also meant something huge to me personally. And now these days it will forever after serve as a huge touchstone in my own personal life regarding a specific moment in time which... interestingly enough, just like the original Woodstock festival itself... was lost two years or so after ""the big victorious hurrah""and sold out. And in the end, again like Woodstock, nothing was changed except for the worse. And it literally brings tears to my eyes to watch it today on a ***BEAUTIFULLY***-restored DVD double set in widescreen and re-feel that one special time in my life when animation in this country had finally reached the summit of victory... and we who were just on the brink of taking the nosedive into the animation industry were all celebrating while walking home after watching ROGER RABBIT for the first time with our hearts high in the sunset... and the future belonged to us...",,Anonymous,Animation

Very Fun And Creative,"After having the opportunity to view this for over two decades, I finally saw ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"" and I must say that I really enjoyed it.The way that the characters interact with the toons is really well done. I know this is not the first movie where live action meets animation, but this film is very successful in it's execution.The script really drives this movie. It's really interesting to see the toon segregated and cast down by the humans as if they are Jews in World War II Germany.The fact that there is a mystery and we accompany Roger and Eddie is a very welcome task and makes for a fun plot.Roger is a very fun and interesting main character as he has many traits of Bugs Bunny, but with a darker undertone.This is a very creative movie and should definitely be checked out.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
crazy and fun,"it was an awesome movie. Bob Hoskins performed well, his reactions to the toons were in my opinion the best, he also did well on his American accent. This doesn't matter to me but just in case you want to know it isn't quite as innocent as a looney toon. If you get the DVD its quite a fun menu. Roger Rabbit is what a toon is supposed to be , funny and insane. My favorite character was Eddie Valiant. probably the most insane parts of the movie were characters acting serious when in a comical situation but don't mind me, I like crazy. The moral of the movie is its better to have a sense of humor I think that's true. It's twisty yet it can be predicted. So if this comment was useful let me know.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
A wonderful film...just not for all ages.,"There are close to 300 reviews for ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"" and it's pretty much accepted in nearly all of them that this movie is a classic. I certainly won't argue that nor the how the film seamlessly integrates live action and cartoons....this is really a given. The film is great entertainment and fun.That being said, I should point out one important thing. Despite being a Disney cartoon, it is NOT for all ages. Some of the jokes are needlessly crude but more than that, the violence in the movie is just too much for young viewers. I let my daughter see it when she was young...and in hindsight, that was a mistake. A great film....just not one for kids under age 7 or 8.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

This is a ground-breaking masterpiece that will never be replicated,"Who Framed Roger Rabbit is an artful picture that enters new territory by interspersing 2D animation with live actors. Seeing the behind-the-scenes and how puppetry was combined with animatronics in order to create practical effects is a mind-boggling experience. The acting here is top-notch, magnificent. It takes real skill to interact with nothing for almost two hours worth of footage. The blending of carton and reality provides an experience like no other. I sincerely believe that no one today would be able to recreate this movie or even this style with as much authenticity as seen in this picture.I am not easily bothered by movies, but the final scene disturbed me and caught me off guard in the best way, just as intended. Most of the effects were flawless, especially considering when this was made and released, but there were a couple moments when the effects were lacking a certain refinement to the point of distraction, which is why I cannot give it a full ten stars, but still, I consider this a fantastic picture.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

Feel Good Movie For Me,"This movie is so unique to me that I had to give it an 8. Calling it a ""great movie"" would be a stretch, but the cross-over animation is so well done for it's time and there truly is not many other movies like this. A movie that can be enjoyed by kids and adults, there is humor, a happy ending, and a classic hero story. This is a movie that you can create a tradition with your family, and have this on every year. It is enjoyable, easy to watch, and the cross-over is so entertaining that it is memorable. Bob Hoskins was great, Jessica Rabbit was hilarious, and I truly can't get enough of this movie.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation

A Neat Blend of Crime and Cartoons,"For it's time, Who Faramed Roger Rabbit the feat. It was unlike any movie out and to this day it is still pretty unique. The way they blended live action with the cartoon worlds was very novel. It's also pretty amazing that they were able to get so many licensed cartoon characters to have cameos in the movie. From Tweety to Mickey, this movie had them all.More so than just being a visual treat, the movie has an engaging crime story. Trying to follow along with the ""who done it"" plot is quite a treat. It's clearly meant for more than just a cartoon loving kid. With that said, I am shocked at the PG rating as there were some questionable moments for a PG movie but I think that was more a product of the times of when the movie was released.If you haven't seen Who Framed Roger Rabbit yet, you owe it to yourself to give it a watch at least to see how well the two worlds, cartoon and live action, were blended.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
great marriage of cartoon and hard-boiled noir,"Roger Rabbit is a distracted Toon performer in the Maroon Cartoon studio. R.K. Maroon hires Toon-hating private detective Eddie Valiant (Bob Hoskins) to investigate Jessica Rabbit and break up their relationship once and for all. Toons supposedly killed Eddie's brother. A private company called Cloverleaf buys up the public transit Red Car. Bartender Dolores (Joanna Cassidy) is an old friend. At the nightclub to see Jessica perform, Eddie photographs Jessica playing pattycake with the owner of Toontown Marvin Acme. Roger Rabbit is distraught and when Marvin Acme turns up dead, he's the prime suspect. Creepy Judge Doom (Christopher Lloyd) intends on tracking down the Rabbit and bringing order to Toontown with the use of his dip. Acme supposed to have a Will leaving Toontown to the Toons. Eddie starts finding evidence of wrong-doing as he investigates.This is a great marriage between the cartoon world and an old style hard-boiled detective story. The only problem is that future live-action animation never lived up to the imagination and shear audacity of this work. The genre becomes mostly kids movies. This is great for kids and for adults who see the influence of classic noirs like Chinatown in this. Bob Hoskins is a great unconventional lead and Jessica Rabbit is the breakout cartoon character.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
How in the world was this film made?,"How in the world was this film made? The fact that Mickey Mouse and Bugs Bunny shared the screen is a feat in itself. What is even more astounding is the blatant sexuality (cartoon sexuality at that) and fairly graphic material produced by the House of Mouse. I started the film thinking that it was a children's film and quickly found that to be false.As far as whodunit films go, Who Framed Roger Rabbit is a pretty great movie. The case is intriguing and I was anxious to see who was behind all the mystery. That being said, the reveal was a little underwhelming for me, even with the slightly more interesting second reveal. As a whole, I did not want the film to end and would gladly have watched another hour of antics.An additional mind boggling fact is that this film was nominated for 7 Academy awards and won 4 of them!",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

Geeky Randy's summary,"Live-action/cartoon combo classic, based on Wolf's 1981 novel WHO CENSORED ROGER RABBIT?, in which private inspector Hoskins investigates a murder where the prime suspect is the title character. Lots of great performances and countless fun cameos that include Disney and Warner characters sharing the screen together for the first time ever. A favorite for many; the film's greatest quality is its timelessness. However, Leonard Maltin summed up the film's fatal flaw terrifically in his capsule, pointing out that it is terribly difficult for even the most open-minded viewer to acclimate to a world where humans and cartoons live together. The MPAA would never rate it PG today.**½ (out of four)",6.0,Anonymous,Animation

"This is the greatest live action/animated movie, and one of the best family films in cinematic history. Bar-none.","""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"" (1988), there are many movies out there where live action and animated characters interact with each other. But this movie hits it out of the park! Not only is it the best live action/animated movie, but it's one of my top 10 favorite family films of all-time. Perfect story, perfect acting, perfect sets/locations, perfect special effects and a perfect soundtrack. The story sounds simple when you first hear the concept, and as you know most movies are just recycled plot lines. That being said, the story was conceived and executed flawlessly. It took a typical every day detective story, and turned it up to 11. Take a brilliant concept, add unique characters along with a brilliant story, and you have a fantastic movie. The acting is stellar, every live action actor and voice actor perform their respectable characters perfectly. But the shining stars are Bob Hoskins as the main protagonist, Eddie Valiant and Christopher Lloyd as the main antagonist, Judge Doom. Bob Hoskins may be a British man, but he was able to do a perfect American accent. When I first saw this movie, I had no idea that he was British until I saw an interview video of him. That really blew my mind! He also had the mammoth task of pretending that he was interacting with various cartoon characters. Sometimes you see a movie like this one where live action actors and cartoons interact, but you can tell that they're not looking at them at all. But in this movie, the film makers, especially the actors went through the pain-staking process to really pretend the character(s) were actually there. Had some other actor besides Bob Hoskins played Eddie Valiant, it may not have worked. Christopher Lloyd is brilliant, as usual, playing the main villain. He also does a perfect job pretending that the cartoon characters were there. Judge Doom stands out as one of the greatest movie villains of all-time. Only Christopher Lloyd can portray such a villain with such a funny, cunning, yet sinister villain with ease. You can tell he, along with the rest of the actors is having the time of his life. The voice actors are phenomenal, Charles Fleischer is brilliant as the voice of Roger Rabbit. To really seal the deal with his performance, he actually wore a rabbit suit on set to add to the character personality! Kathleen Turner does great as Jessica Rabbit's speaking voice and Amy Irving does a great job as Jessica's singing voice. Mel Blanc, the voice acting king, is brilliant as usual as the Looney Tunes characters. Every live action actor and voice actor does a flawless job with their parts! The sets/locations are outstanding, it's like you took a trip back in time to the late 1940s, 1947 to be exact, in the setting of the film. As for the special effects, they are perfect and still hold up to this day. Before the production of this movie, the film makers thought bringing the concept to the screen would be impossible. But, with a lot of hard work and dedication, it turned out to be a outstanding and memorable piece of cinema. Finally, Alan Silvestri wrote and composed a phenomenal soundtrack to really tie this movie together. The ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"" soundtrack is one of the most memorable in all of cinema, and Alan Silvestri is certainly another one of my top 10 favorite music composers. Just like fine wine, even though I don't drink, I'm just trying to make a reference here. This movie just gets better and better with age, and is without a shadow of a doubt, one of my favorite family films of all-time. It is truly a timeless film for any generation. I can watch this movie over and over again and never get tired of it. Of course, I give this movie 5 out of 5 stars on my scale, which equates to 10 out of 10 IMDB stars. If you have not seen ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"" yet, what are you waiting for? Go see it, or the Toon Patrol will come and get you! Now let's end this review with a moment of silence for the late, but great, Bob Hoskins, Mae Questel, Stubby Kaye, and the one and only Mel Blanc. Thank you all for providing great entertainment and making the world of cinema that much better. May you all rest in peace. If you're looking for a perfect live action/animated movie, then this is the movie for you. Words cannot describe how much I adore this film, go watch it today if you haven't before. You won't regret it, I promise.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

Robert Zemeckis brings another groundbreaking elemental feature by merging animation with live action,"Who Framed Roger Rabbit (1988) :
Brief Review -Robert Zemeckis brings another groundbreaking elemental feature by merging animation with live action. Zemeckis had become a known name at that time with the groundbreaking time travel film ""Back to the Future"" (1985). Though the other parts didn't really go on that level, he played much safer by making Who Framed Roger Rabbit before those two other films of the franchise. Based on the 1981 novel ""Who Censored Roger Rabbit?"" the film brings a groundbreaking idea of animation and live-action coming together in a full-fledged feature film. Even though the ground-breaking idea had been cracked decades ago, nobody actually made anything like this on this level. Besides, the film brought a nasty humor and visuals that united kid and adult audiences to enjoy this beautiful flick as a community. It is set in 1947, so obviously some of those old Hollywood times jokes are difficult to understand for others, and yet the film was liked by contemporary audiences, which means it actually had more to offer. The jokes on ""Harvey,"" ""Walt,"" ""Patty-cake,"" ""Sunset Boulevard,"" and ""Femme Fatale"" were inspired by old gems, and you gotto have some knowledge of them to enjoy these jokes to their full potential. Even if you don't, it's still fine because it's a healthy comedy otherwise. A few scenes are too childish, but there are also many that are too smart to understand. That balance was kept by the screenplay of Jeffrey Price and Peter S. Seaman. Zemeckis knew that it was a difficult assignment, so he took extra care of the small details. You might notice them if you are not too busy and involved with the nostalgia and toons world. Overall, a great film and should stand the test of time for decades to come. The Disney Renaissance era actually started right after this! Watch it, enjoy it, and try to understand it, if you can.RATING - 7/10*By - #samthebestest.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Humorous toons and detective work. A murder mystery. I like this film and it's superb!,"I love watching cartoons whether it's from Disney or Warner Bros. I was still a baby when the film was released in June of 1988. Now I'm an adult. When I saw this film for the first time growing up, all the toons from Disney, Warner Bros. and Universal Pictures were colliding and interacting with each other. I became impressed.I love Roger Rabbit. Bob Hoskins did a great job playing Eddie Valiant and Christopher Lloyd is excellent playing Judge Doom. I liked the film's composing by Alan Silvestri. I really wish to meet Roger Rabbit at the Toontown attraction in Disneyland. There's humor and a bit of naughtiness. Watch the film and you'll laugh along with Roger Rabbit.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Enjoyable family picture with great juxtaposition of real and imaginary,"Private Detective Eddie Valiant (Hoskins) attempts to help Roger Rabbit, a Toon who is accused of murder whilst overcoming his own drinking problems and hurtful past.Over 20 years old Robert Zemeckis' picture still remains a family favourite and with its array of charming cartoons, simple narrative and collection of positive meanings it should remain so for another few decades.Since the turn of 2000 family entertainment has been represented by two words, Harry Potter. The charming story of a mistreated young boy discovering his true purpose in life has demonstrated how media influence and positive good will can charm audiences of any ages and much must be said for this film.Having viewed this for the first time yesterday I sat and enjoyed a story regarding cartoons living in a world dominated by miserable humans. Like Potter, it takes a fantasy ideology and implements them into the real world, making it somewhat believable. We could all be Muggles or we could all see cartoons walking down the street. What brought this film to my attention was many reviews proclaiming this as one of the best family films ever created. Certainly the idea of this film puts it with the best, but if like me you have seen countless films of family entertainment over the years its not too difficult to see where this film is heading.Bob Hoskins, in a pretty conventional role, spends the whole film frowning and drinking, Christopher Lloyd (almost distinguishable) portrays a hard nosed negative villain and the obvious love interest is decoded through a fairly blank portrayal by Joanna Cassidy.Whilst there may be a formula to all this negative energy in way of the story, there is some light hearted revelations in way of the cartoons.The geeky and absurd Roger Rabbit acts completely bonkers that will generate laughs with viewers of a young age whilst older viewers, particularly guys, will enjoy the Jessica Rabbit encoding. Kathleen Turner's seductive voice has won many fans over but the animation of Jessica, the slim figure, long hair and positive and suggestive movements are hardly forgettable.The story revolves around Bob attempting to earn cash but when he gets Roger in trouble he must attempt to resolve the case of his framing. Whilst the plot moves along at a respectable pace using humour and familiar crime detective movements, it gives off a positive enjoyable ride.Zemeckis has created an astonishing ideology by juxtaposing humans with cartoons that have been worked through a tough process to generate a real world feeling. There are no awkward dialogue timings or cinematic mistakes of deception, everything fits together to create a foundation of realism.This is an enjoyable picture that uses this concept to generate the most laughs between humans and animations and whilst the conclusion is inevitable and the performances are fairly ordinary it is a good family entertainment picture.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
I saw it and I didn't believed it,"Who Framed Roger Rabbit is not just a masterpiece, but the biggest masterpiece ever, in my opinion, sure, it isn't known as a Disney or 80's classic while being both, but I think it is better than does, like Back to the Future or The Lion King, and I still think does are masterpieces.This movie is so good that I needed to think if I should or not make a commentary on it, But at first, i didn't got why do I love it so much, sure, it is almost perfect, but, I didn't knew what makes it almost perfect, until I realized the answer was: everythingRather you want to see this as a mystery drama or a comedy, the story, humor, animation, acting and characters work, Disney movies like The Lion King or The Hunchback of Notre Dame are adult, but this is the most adult of them all, including the MCU or Pirates of the Caribbean.This movie is for an actual reason rated PG, unlike movies that should be rated PG-13, like Beetlejuice or Jaws, or G, like Uglydolls, Ice Age, or Inside Out, it isn't rated PG to sell better like other moviesThe Animated And live action characters interact perfectly, the animation itself is great, Bob Hoskins as Eddie Valiant & Cristopher Lloyd as Judge Doom are perfect actors, the voice acting is great, it is perfectly edited, and as for my favorite part, the characters:They're all great, Eddie Valiant is almost always angry and hates toons, but when you get to know him better you get to know why, Roger Rabbit is hilarious, Benny, Baby Herman And Smarty Weasel are more of the comic realiefes, and I could go on with Jessica Rabbit, R.K. Maroon & Judge Doom, but that would be spoilers.After all, I guess I can't say everything great about this film in just 1 review, I wish IMDb had an 11/10 to wish it had a 12/10, it is just so good",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
The True Beginning of the Disney Renaissance!,"Robert Zemeckis's Who Framed Roger Rabbit is a groundbreaking film reminiscent of those hard-boiled 40 film-noirs....except animation is used. The whole concept of the movie is combining animation and live action and the results were astounding from a visual perspective. As of publication of this review, this remains the only film where Disney and Warner Brother characters appear with one another. That explains the piano duet with the famous ducks, Daffy and Donald, am I right? From a story perspective, we follow a noir story beat-to-beat. Sometimes the story can fall into ""only for kids"" zone and Roger Rabbit himself is a bit annoying at times, but it is really a blast watching all of our toons come together in live action and look...real!Bless the hearts of director Robert Zemeckis (Back to the Future), producer Steven Spielberg, animator director Richard Williams, and the hundreds of animators that worked long, long hours to create a film that broke boundaries. The film was released before CGI, so all animation was hand-drawn! Considering Zemeckis and cinematographer Dean Cundey's rapid camera movement, just imagine the difficult work it was for these animators. Even today, everything looked so realistic, so stylish. The movements of the toons were in sync with their live action counterparts. How did this process happen? The live action scenes were shot first with the animation carefully added afterwards. To deliver the best voice performance, the man who voiced Roger Rabbit, Charles Fleischer, decided to dress up as his character on set. I am sure it helped the live actors too.Zemeckis originally wanted to make the film in the early 80's but Disney passed because the director was not a known commodity yet. After the back-to-back box office successes of Romancing the Stone and Back to the Future, Disney felt comfortable enough with him onboard. The movie had the highest budget for any animated film at time and Zemeckis made sure each dollar counted, but he allowed for more risqué (yeah....you know.... Jessica Rabbit) scenes to be added. Because of more mature content, Disney opted to release the film under its Touchstone label. The screenplay, based off the novel from Gary K. Wolf, was written by Jeffrey Price and Peter Seamen. They studied the works of the Golden Age of American animation, and we see their influences. The Looney Tunes. Mickey/Minnie Mouse, all can be found! While filling their script with nostalgia, thankfully enough room was left for an original story involving the toons and humans.The story takes place in Los Angeles in the 1940's. Humans and toons live in a world where they co-exist with one another. Roger Rabbit (voiced by Fleischer) lives an easy life with his wife, Jessica Rabbit (uncredited voice acted by Kathleen Turner). She also happens to be fooling around with the head of Maroon Cartoons. If that was not bad enough, he happened to be found dead and Roger is accused of murder. Enter Eddie Valiant (Bob Hoskins). He has a personal vendetta against toons, but the down-and-out detective is forced with helping Roger clear his name and escape from the relentless Judge Doom (Christopher Lloyd). They must trek all over LA...and even into Toon Town to complete their mission.I can imagine how weird it must have been for the live actors to perform opposite a green screen with no one there (aka the toons). It is a blink of an eye easy for actors now, but not in 1988. That said, everyone delivered admirable performances. Sure, some can occasionally venture into over-the-top territory, but we are talking about toons. Bob Hoskins is reliably great and delivers a deep performance. I think Christopher Lloyd is honored with the best performance. His villain is so memorable. Everything from his black clothes/hat to the fact he does not blink is unnerving. Even Disney officials were concerned he would be too scary for kids. Of course, it was great seeing the toons...which is why the movie exists in the first place. I grew up loving these characters with this movie playing a big part in that. I was not alive when this originally premiered, so I can imagine the awe people had seeing these groundbreaking visuals for the first time.Overall, Who Framed Roger Rabbit should be seen just to see where animation and live action combined for the very first time. In addition to that, we have a story with memorable characters and one straight from the noir era of the 1940's. It mostly works. It holds up very well...even if I find Roger Rabbit himself a bit annoying at times. This film is officially the beginning of the 'Disney Renaissance."" There would be no The Little Mermaid or The Lion King without this effort from Robert Zemeckis.

But what's truly astonishing is the love and care that went into filming this. A Big Studio(s) entertainment movie with a heart! It's as if all those cynical producers, screenplay supervisors etc. were enchanted by the whole charming enterprise themselves.Seldom has a fantasy world been created more vividly. And the nostalgic impact seeing all your beloved old cartoon characters (and some amiable new ones) naturally interacting with each other and their human neighbours is simply mesmerizing. Watch the pic a second time to get all the funny one-liners and sight gags... and an umpteenth time for sheer pleasure.Every movie-loving person will be hooked immediately, but cartoon buffs and film noir freaks should keep tranquilizers ready.Were it not for the interminable and mildly dull showdown, which is a misstep, this would be a perfect masterpiece of light entertainment.

"""Is he always this funny, or only on days when he's wanted for murder?""","'Who Framed Roger Rabbit' is simply a lot of fun, a good-natured hybrid of the hard-boiled film noirs of the 1940s and the iconic Hollywood cartoons of about the same time. It was directed by Robert Zemeckis, who  having also given us such classics as 'Back to the Future (1985)' and 'Forrest Gump (1994)'  we know is highly adept at providing excellent, wholesome entertainment, and this film is a glowing example of his talents. Meticulously crafted, 'Who Framed Roger Rabbit' is a technical marvel, faultlessly blending cartoon characters and live-action performances, without ever allowing the visual effects to overshadow the story. The $70 million film was a risky investment for Amblin Entertainment and The Walt Disney Company, but delivered handsome box-office returns (approximately. $330 million worldwide), almost universal critical acclaim and four Academy Awards (including one Special Achievement Award for Richard Williams' animation direction). The film is also unique in that, for the first time, it brought many of cinema's classic cartoon characters from different studios together on screen, mainly for brief cameo roles; including Mickey Mouse (Disney), Bugs Bunny (Warner Bros.), Droopy Dog (MGM), Betty Boop (Paramount Pictures) and Woody Woodpecker (Walter Lantz).The film was based on Gary K. Wolf's book, entitled ""Who Censored Roger Rabbit?,"" and the screenplay was written by Jeffrey Price and Peter S. Seaman. The plot for the film also borrows many elements from the film noirs of the 1940s, as well as some of the more recent neo-noirs, particularly Roman Polanski's 'Chinatown (1974).' The setting is Hollywood, 1947. For years, humans and cartoon characters (""Toons"") have co-existed together, though relations have often been a bit frictional. The Toons, when they're not working for the major animation studios, reside in Toon-town, an entirely-animated city that is owned by childlike, gag-gifts supplier Marvin Acme (Stubby Kaye). After Acme is found dead, a hefty vault having been dumped on his head, zany and disaster-prone Toon Roger Rabbit (voiced by Charles Fleischer) is suspected of the murder, having recently discovered that his beautiful wife Jessica Rabbit (voiced by Kathleen Turner and Amy Irving) had been cheating on him with the deceased. Eddie Valiant (Bob Hoskins) is a depressed, drunken and hard-boiled private investigator with a militant dislike of Toons, due to the horrible death of his brother five years earlier, at the hands of an unknown, red-eyed cartoon lunatic. After Roger is accused of murder, Valiant is pressed  against his wishes  to uncover the conspiracy and clear the rabbit's name.I genuinely believe that 'Who Framed Roger Rabbit' can rank with the very best animated films that Hollywood has produced. Just a quite scroll down its credits page reveals the hundreds upon hundreds of crew members whose tireless efforts painstakingly brought the animated characters to life; every single piece of animation was hand-drawn without the use of computers, and analogue optical effects were also used for adding shadows and lighting to the Toons. The way that the live-actors interact with their animated counterparts is nothing short of awe-inspiring, and no minute detail is left imperfect. These Toons cast shadows, break windows, smash plates on their head, slam doors and grab hold of humans, and all this is achieved convincingly. The main actors, especially Bob Hoskins, keep their performances astonishingly natural, despite presumably communicating with empty space a lot of the time. Even if you don't take the time to consider what a remarkable technical achievement the film is, you are still very likely to fall in love with it; 'Who Framed Roger Rabbit' is the most fun I've had watching a movie in quite a few months. At first it seems like a film that only children would enjoy, despite the occasionally dark theme (several murders take place, including the surprisingly shocking ""dipping"" of an animated shoe). However, Robert Zemeckis has succeeded in creating that rare thing  a picture that is equally entertaining for adults and children alike.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
"One of the best, if not the best, animated features of all time","I absolutely love animation (not to be confused with anime) and Who Framed Roger Rabbit? is my favorite.  With Disney and Warner Brothers characters appearing in the same film for the first time, and Betty Boop weighing in as well, that would be enough.  But there is also a new cast of animateds in addition-Roger and Jessica Rabbit, Baby Herman and the weasels, et cetera. It's toon heaven on earth.  There is a very intricate plot that works as a comedy and as a mystery, characters who grow and that you care about and great special effects.  But what I love most about the movie is the action on the fringes.  I've seen the movie at least a dozen times and I always catch something I've never spotted before.  The movie comes flying at you a hundred miles an hour and there's so much going on in most of it that you can't catch everything the first time.  For some people, Toy Story is the best animated feature of all time and for some it's Snow White or Fantasia and there is a case that can be made for each.  But for my money, Who Framed Roger Rabbit? is the champ so far.  My highest recommendation.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
"A wonderfully wacky tale of a rabbit, a detective and crime","Who Framed Roger Rabbit is one of the most entertaining pieces of fluff I have ever had the pleasure of watching. From the opening sequence to the end credits the viewer is bombarded by a series of dazzling colors, a soothing score and lots of special effects. Although the effects in the movie may seem somewhat simple, they are not bad for a film shot before the advent of digital alterations. Bob Hoskins plays Eddie Valiant, a detective who is at times almost as animated as the toons with which he lives. Christopher Lloyd is superb as the evil judge and Roger Rabbit is brought to life by an incredibly energetic comedian named Charles Fleischer, who by the way needs to get more vocal and acting jobs. Roger Rabbit is a must see for any cartoon fan, child and adult alike.",,Anonymous,Animation

I also think that Who Framed Roger Rabbit has a better story line. In Space Jam they just base a basketball game on saving the day.

Not really for kids or adults,"'Who Framed Roger Rabbit' is one of those classic films that you just have to get around to watching at some point, even if it isn't your kind of thing. To be honest though I had hoped I would enjoy it a lot more than I ultimately did. I hoped for two things going in, I hoped to be invested in the mystery, and I hoped to find it funny. The movie failed on both of those fronts for me. The mystery the title presents isn't like a whodunnit, it's just something that we assume will eventually be revealed by the end of the film. And the comedy was strange. I had hoped it would be aimed at adults (which it kind of is) but the humour is stuff only children would ever find funny. There's a very strange tone in this film.I'm sure that back in 1988 the animation achieved here was a real milestone and the filmmakers deserve credit for that. And even though they seemed to want an adult tone at times, they would've been pretty limited by how far they could push it. I would be interested though how much children actually enjoy this film. It feels like the a film that kids could hate, and adults could as well. It didn't work for me anyway. 5/10.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
Noir Mixed With Cartoons,"The first time I saw this film was in a movie theater in the summer of 88. We were having a family reunion and we took our kids to see this. Imagine the first viewing. As the film started, I thought I was seeing a ROGER RABBIT short as a warm-up to the main event. I don't remember ever seeing a Roger Rabbit cartoon when I was growing up, but I thought ""What the heck? Even if it's new, it should be pretty good."" Well, about five minutes into this little short, a director yells, ""CUT!"" and this little cartoon character in diapers yells, ""WHAT THE HELL WAS WRONG WITH THAT TAKE!"" On first viewing, this was a little jarring, seeing this cartoon in diapers using rather racy language. On subsequent viewings, it was something innovative and a little cutting edge. This was the first cartoon I ever saw that was geared more toward adults.Animation with live action was nothing new, even in 1988, (SONG OF THE SOUTH, MARY POPPINS, AND PETE'S DRAGON anyone?) but the interaction between the cartoon characters and their live counterparts never looked so natural. Even in the more physical parts like when Baby Herman whacked his secretary on the fanny and Eddie grabbed Roger by the ears, dunked him in the sink, and slapped the handcuffs on him was pure genius. My hat's off to the actors and the film editors for this. It was very impressive. (Also the part where the gorilla bouncers threw Eddie out of the night club was very well done as well.) This movie told a good story as well and didn't just rely on gimmicks like a lot of films of this nature do. It was a standard noir detective story, very much like the time period it was set in. But I think this is the first time a toon was ever accused of murder. And Jessica was very sexy looking for a cartoon. How about Betty Boop being out of work because cartoons went to color? There are some really wonderful things in this movie.The video I got less than a year later was always a favorite whenever we had adult parties or sleepovers for kids. People of all ages loved this movie. And Bos Hoskins (hope I got that name right) did a wonderful job with his California accent. I would never have known he was British if I hadn't researched him on this site. And it's hard for me to think of Christopher Lloyd as anyone but eccentric but likable Doc Brown in BACK TO THE FUTURE. He did a great job playing mean old Judge Doom. A noir detective story mixed in with some wacky cartoon fun. A great little ride. 9.5 out of 10.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Sutured with care,"By some kind of miracle, ""Who Frammed Roger Rabbit"" received a PG rating despite its very dark themes, segments of non-cartoonish violence, and prominent sexuality. This very fact made it hard for me to enjoy this well-crafted film-noir. But even if the film had received an appropriate rating, nothing would excuse its divergence from the supposed nature of cartoons in the film. The 'toons' are supposed to exist to make people laugh, but character Jessica Rabbit has grotesque features very much aimed toward her sexual parts, like she was conceived from some beyond help geekoid. Sure I remember the hilarious ""Little Red Riding Hood"" shorts that involved a very frisky wolf, but Rabbit's character was emphasized so disturbingly beyond her importance as the femme fatale in this mock film-noir. I wasn't laughing. Still, there are very clever homages to the nature of 'toons' (and underlying tones that allude to racism and genocide) that make the film work. The toons are blended so realistically into the story, technically and thematically, that I will praise it for such. Loopy cartoons and 1940's film noir should be wholly analogous to each other, but here they work to a level that makes it feel like this genre has always existed. This idea does much favor to the film's aesthetic appeal, and the animation appears to be computer animated with its use of shadow, despite the dark tone coloring. It was certainly a technical achievement. I'm sure the film inspired future efforts of the odd mixing of defined groups of entertainment, ""Happy Feet"", ""Space Jam"" and ""Shrek"" all come to mind, the latter being one of the better films in my opinion. So certainly, it is a big contribution to the animation medium.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Rabbit hops along at an hilarious pace.,"One of the most original and novel films of the eighties Who Framed Roger Rabbit is a laugh filled non-stop comedy for all ages as well as subversive satire with historical roots. It is also history making with the first and only appearance on stage together of the two biggest quacks in animation history Donald and Daffy.Private Detective Eddie Valiant is hired to get the goods on cartoon star Roger Rabbit's voluptuous wife Jessica and Acme cartoon producer Marvin Acme. Producing evidence RR goes ballistic and Acme ends up dead. Naturally Rog is the prime suspect but Valiant digs deeper and finds there is a lot more to the equation than a simple homicide.Melding animation with reality fluidly Rabbit takes off from the get go with high comic moments from end to end as both Looney, Disney and assorted other cartoon greats make appearances that will permanently imprint a smile on your face from beginning to end. In addition there are some wonderfully appropriate references to Chinatown mimicking not only scenes but also bureaucratic skulduggery with a basis in truth that plagued LA in the first half of the century.Bob Hoskins as the rumpled alcoholic gumshoe is fire plug sized perfect to ride around in talking taxi's and punch out cartoon characters with a frustrated cynicism. Christopher Lloyd also fills the villain role with aplomb, sadistically dispensing with a toon in the films most disturbing scene. On the animation side Roger is annoyingly and hilariously unable to put a cork in it. The buxom Jessica is a combination Lauren Bacall, Mae West who claims she's not bad, ""just drawn that way"". Then there are the dozens of cameo performances of animated greats populating the film that never allow you to catch your breath along with all sorts of cartoon gadgets that make you realize the kid in you never left.

"There's fun to be had for classic cartoon buffs, but it's not great.","Contrary to popular belief, not everyone loves 'Who Framed Roger Rabbit?'. I appreciate the creativity and imagination involved, but there are several things about the film that have always bugged me.Firstly, and most importantly, Roger himself: I really dislike his voice and mannerisms - he should have been loveable, but instead he's thoroughly irritating. When much of the film revolves around such an obnoxious character, we're not off to a good start.Secondly, the animation: it's clever the way it is integrated into real-life (although not as ground-breaking as it is claimed to be - remember Mary Poppins and Bedknobs and Broomsticks?), but I hate the soft shading used to give a supposedly realistic 3D effect; I'd much prefer simpler cel shading or none at all.Bob Hoskins always seemed to me like a strange choice: he doesn't suit the role of a tough, hard-drinking noir-style detective. He's too short and pudgy.The plot is kinda dull: some tommyrot about a missing will, real estate deals and a plan to build a freeway. Yawn.And the run-time of 104 minutes is unnecessarily long.On the plus side, Christopher Lloyd is great as villain Judge Doom (scary enough to give young kids bad dreams), Joanna Cassidy as Eddie's love interest is yummy, there are some fun cameos from classic cartoon characters, and the final fight that makes use of lots of Acme products is inventive.On the whole, I find the film to be passable entertainment, but it's not one that I like to revisit all that often.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation

Who Framed Roger Rabbit is a genius concept that delivers an incredibly entertaining film.,"Is this strictly a children's film? No. Is this a typical adult orientated flick? No. It's in that niche area where everyone of all ages can find enjoyment out of this. A detective is caught in the midst of a murder where a toon named Roger Rabbit is framed, they then team up to unravel the mystery. This could've easily been a by-the-numbers children's plot, but to make it a murder mystery instead was bold. Incredibly bold, yet it works so well. It's just genius. The whole concept of toons interacting with humans and how their worlds are linked is nothing short of brilliance. The technology used at the time was groundbreaking. Green screen aplenty, stunt work with wires and perfect sound effects editing, this is a technical masterpiece. The compelling plot with memorable characters is the icing on the cake. The whole ""being forced to work together to save the day"" concept has been done many times and is a rather tired formula, that is literally my only complaint. Oh, and certain scenes where animation and reality didn't blend particularly well (very very very minor gripe). But my God this film is amazing. I think what's more impressive is the idea that these rivalling animation studios (Disney, Hanna Barbera etc.) actually agreed to have their properties in one film. Together. Which really creates the perfect ""ToonTown"" so to speak. It harks back to my childhood. Having Bugs Bunny and Mickey Mouse on screen together, I would never have thought it. The nostalgia just took over the film and made it a much more personal viewing for me. The cartoonish antics of objects falling on them, running into walls or inanimate objects being able to speak. It's just oh so beautiful to watch. Bob Hoskins and Christopher Lloyd were fantastic, although the latter does have a pretty ghastly scene towards the end that might be slightly too much for children! Robert Zemeckis just keeps pumping out engaging movies, a severely overlooked director. Loved it, loved it, loved it.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
An artful blend of comedy and technology,I just re-watched this other day for the first time in ~30 years. The movie holds up very well on all fronts. The integration of the live-action and animation is still the chief joy of the film-it is amazing how convincing the effects still are-but there's enough gags to make it a fun story as well.Seeing this as an adult made me appreciate the parody of crime-film noir a lot more but it is not as sharp as it could be. Doom and the Dip are quite dark but I feel like the concept (the book is much darker than the movie) got a little too disneyfied. There's a truly great film here if the production risked being just slightly more subversive. It would have been wonderful to a see a slightly seeder film.Benny the Cab is still the best part of this through; he is such a Brooklynn cabbie.,8.0,Anonymous,Animation

Bob Hoskins' at his best,"This is not so much a comment on  a fun, wonderful film with lots of great, memory-stirring cameos, but more in the line of a critique of Bob Hoskins. This was the first film in which I saw Hoskins. But not the last. Since then, were ZULU DAWN, and HOOK, to name a few. When seeing Eddie Valiant, I had no trouble accepting Hoskins as an American. But when I saw ZULU, I found, as in other films, that he actually has a strong British accent, and fit the role of a Color Sergeant Major in the British Army very well. He's a truly gifted, and in my opinion, the epitome of a versatile actor. He can do anything and I've never ceased to be amazed by his range of characters. Not many serious dramatic actors would have taken on the WFRR role and done as well or seemingly had so much fun with it, but I'd bet that Hoskins took the job of acting with a whole range of totally nonexistent characters, the Toons, and making it work sa a personal challenge.

Great riff on General Motors as well as a great movie,"Around the 1920s, General Motors decided it was a good idea for everyone to drive cars. Their response to this blue sky thinking was to buy up all the trolly companies that they could and close them, putting thousands of trolly workers out of their jobs across the country.

"Richard Williams and Robert Zemeckis, together","This movie is a joy. It's a technical achievement, a wonderful callback to a lost era in Hollywood, and a great example of a genre that had fallen out of favor all while being thoroughly entertaining with enough broad appeal to be a big box office hit. This is Robert Zemeckis using his accumulated craft and knowledge of the medium and applying it to someone else's work with energy and intelligence without ever losing a sense of fun. A movie about humans and cartoons feels like it should be fluff, but the sheer entertainment value makes it something truly special.In a world where cartoons walk amongst us, it is post-war Los Angeles and private detective Eddie Valiant has been called into R.K. Maroon's office in Hollywood to take a job. Their star, Roger Rabbit, is having trouble with his performance, and the problem may be his wife, Jessica, cheating on him. Eddie is sent to take whatever pictures he can to prove the charge. As with most of Zemeckis' early work, one of the joys is the little details that get peppered throughout the beginning of the film that end up paying off later. Eddie's brother and their shared background as clowns and circus performers, conveyed through a single tracking shot that evokes not only Zemeckis' own Back to the Future but also Hitchcock's Rear Window and contains an imperceptible time jump, all comes back later, especially in the final moments of the movie. As Eddie takes the job, finds a camera to use, and goes to the exclusive nightclub, we get all of these little details, and they provide depth to the world and to Eddie's character at the same time.Well, Eddie finds Jessica in a compromising situation (literally playing patty-cake with Mr. Acme, the owner of the gag company just this side of Toon Town), and Roger goes missing. Acme ends up dead, and the mystery begins to unfold. Another great thing about this film is how the mystery evokes some of the great noir mysteries, especially Chinatown. It's a plot to eventually tear down Toon Town and replace it with a freeway. The clues are dropped throughout (pulled from real life in a certain way), and it ends up working as a noir mystery on its own. Replace Toon Town with the slums of LA or a section of town for a minority, and you could move the story wholesale into a more realistic setting without cartoon characters.The thing about the cartoon characters is that they work really well both as characters and as feeling like they exist in the same physical space as the human actors. They are largely defined by easily identifiable traits, like Roger being zany with little thought and Jessica being sexy but devoted to her husband, but they are not really the center of the film. That's Bob Hoskin's Eddie Valiant. Broken after the death of his brother at the hands of a toon as they chased down a lead on a bank robbery, he refuses to work for toons and has grown into a fair bit of a bigot against them. He has an arc that keeps him a hard-boiled detective but allows him the ability to empathize with these cartoon characters. Up against him is Judge Doom, played wonderfully by Christopher Lloyd, who is all menace and turns into quite the unique monster by the end.The success of the physicalness of the cartoon characters is mainly due to two people. The first is Zemeckis himself who brought all the technical innovations together in front of the camera to begin with. The second is Richard Williams, the director of the animation. Williams was an animator based in England who had mainly worked on commercials, but he got the job on Roger Rabbit because of his unfinished feature film The Thief and the Cobbler.Now, a quick second to talk about The Thief and the Cobbler. It has one of the longest production schedules in film history. Williams tried for literally decades to get it done, eventually getting $25 million to make it in the early 90s based on his work on Roger Rabbit. It was never completed by him, the bond company eventually taking away from him and finishing it with the title Arabian Knights. A fan put together the Re-Cobbled edition a few years ago, and while unfinished it's the work of a master who is in complete love of his art. The visuals are so beautiful that its simplistic story can get overlooked. His is a sad story because he never really recovered from the collapse of his production of his masterwork.Anyway, what Williams brought to Roger Rabbit was amazing ability from him and his team, but also an incredible ability to adapt to a new way of making animation. You see, Zemeckis didn't leave his camera stationary all that much. He loved to pan around in a space, and he wasn't going to stop just because it was going to be easier for the animators. So, using motion controlled cameras, he was able to film everything he wanted and Williams was able to find a way to keep the animated characters seemed fixed in a stationary location while the camera moved. On top of that, characters interact with the environment around them through animatronics that the animations hid, and it all looks so incredibly seamless.There's such multi-faceted fun to be had with Who Framed Roger Rabbit. From the technical performances to the narrative, this film is a joy to watch. Zemeckis took on a difficult job and made it seem almost effortless. Terry Gilliam actually turned down the offer to direct this simply because if felt like too much work. I'd be curious to see what Gilliam would have made of it, but what Zemeckis made was wonderful.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
An absolute gem,"This was the very first film I ever saw in a cinema when I was 10 years old. It was my birthday present! I had McNuggets for the first time too! Haha!I remember being absolutely delighted by it then - seeing all of my favourite cartoon characters on screen together as well as some new ones - and really being thrilled by what was quite a grown up storyline. Not really worrying about the more adult stuff going over my head!I've watched it so many times since and I appreciate it even more every time. For the brilliant writing, the incredible animation alongside the live action - no wonder it won Oscars! - and the fact that I now know what it took to get Donald and Daffy, my two favourite ducks, in the same ""room"" together, let alone all those others!Just an absolute gem of a film.

"Right Place, Right Time.","1980's Zemeckis, Lloyd and Cartoons...Is there any better combination!?!In a time where Zemeckis could do no wrong, Christopher Lloyd was good and Bob Hoskins was for some reason becoming a MEGA-Star...they made ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit""What else do I need to say?This film was made right on time, you could almost say it's a kind of farewell to the traditional cartoon (yes, yes the Disney films etc...), because ten years later Computers would take control!!! I know there were other successful 2-d movies after W.F.R.R but this film had so many characters of old regardless to who they belonged to in the 1940's. The film is very much what you see is what you get, it's crude in places now but still a movie I can watch time and time again!Joel Silver was great aswell!",,Anonymous,Animation
"Roger, shut the hell up!","I had such high hopes in 1988 when I first heard the details about this movie being made. I read every article about it, anticipating its opening. Add Robert Zemeckis to the mix and I wanted to see it as bad as ""Back to the Future II"" (another disappointment, by the way) and the release was finally here and I went on opening day. Sure, the combined animation and live action was genius, but the story itself needed a complete re-write, for starters. Bob Hoskins was totally miscast as the drunken detective. The opening cartoon was funny but that just started all the screaming from Roger to follow. When the title character is this pathetic and loud and annoying, it's not a fun experience. I tried it again twenty years after its premier and I still didn't like it much, if at all. Watch it with the sound off Eddie! Pl-leeeeze!",3.0,Anonymous,Animation
Loved it.,My Rating : 8/10'Who Framed Roger Rabbit?' is no doubt a classic - rendering animated cartoon characters with live action footage and throw in a murder mystery with unforgettable characters you have an impossibly unique combination that can be enjoyed by everyone.This is a must-see for any film lover!,8.0,Anonymous,Animation
"""I'm not bad, I'm just drawn that way.""","The animated rabbit is accused of killing a man and he is to be punished by ""deleting"" sentence. His beautiful animated wife and a human private detective are trying to solve this case and save the rabbit and the whole animated world from destruction.For me, this noir-mystery-comedy-thriller to this day remains the best movie that combines live action and animated film. I saw it countless times, never found a flaw, and I could count the qualities until the day after tomorrow. The story is simple but well-written, the combination of the noir atmosphere and the atmosphere of short cartoons is captivating, and one-liners are hilarious. This is the only film in which Disney and Warner characters appear together on the screen, and there are also several characters from other studios. The film has several parallels to ""Chinatown"" and ""Back to the Future"", and it parodies or pays homage to many more iconic movies and characters. It is full of awesome details that you have no chance to notice all during just one viewing, and for some it is necessary to watch the movie in slow motion because they are put in single frames.What fascinates me most about this movie is that computer animation wasn't used at all. Everything was done old-school and 326 animators hand-drawn over a million drawings, of which nearly one hundred thousand frames were used in the movie. With 70 million dollars invested, this is the most expensive film of the 80's. It had six Academy Awards nominations, out of which it won three. I must also mention the excellent music by Alan Silvestri (Fandango, Cat's Eye, Back to the Future franchise, Predator, Young Guns II, The Bodyguard, Judgment Night, Forrest Gump, Judge Dredd, Identity, Van Helsing, Night at the Museum, Captain America, The Avengers).I recommend this movie to everyone, and if you end up amazed like me, you can find tons of interesting trivia online. I just spent a couple of hours reading interesting things about this movie and rewinding the movie to find the details I'm reading about.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Great moment in cinema, weak lead rabbit and all","I loved it, but I'm going to nit-pick for a few moments.  Do you mind?It was set in 1941, yet you'll notice the appearance of one or two characters (notably Droopy) who were unknown at that time.  (Of course, ""unknown"" doesn't mean ""non-existent"".)  The Goofy cartoon we see in the cinema wasn't made until 1949.  (I looked it up: but I didn't have to look it up to know it was later than 1941.)  Jessica Rabbit was a good femme fatale caricature, but somehow just wasn't sexy.  And Roger Rabbit is (as subsequent shorts have shown) a terrible cartoon character - how he could possibly have sustained a career even without a scandal looming over his head is beyond me.Ah, well.  The film was MADE for nit-pickers, or at least for those people who eagerly watch for glimpses of the elusive toon life of 1941.  And creating a short cartoon leading character on demand, as many have said, just can't be done - especially when the art is dead.  Roger Rabbit somehow manages to transcend his limitations and become a good foil for this particular film.Look, it was great. The implications of the living toons were for the most part thought through clearly (contradictions neatly and brazenly ignored). The special effects were fantastic - among the best of all time, up there with ""2001"", ""Star Wars"", ""Jurassic Park"".  And who could turn down the duet between Daffy Duck and Donald Duck?  It clearly ought to have been longer. If need be they could have made time by cutting out the dutiful homage to Mickey Mouse (who had little more to live for in 1941) and Bugs Bunny (who was never very good).  Damn, I'm nit-picking again.  Ignore me.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
"This is some of the best quality in both cartoon, film noir, and family entertainment in years - and maybe even decades...","The hints at Bogart and the winks towards classic film noirs are routinely expected - but ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"" rises above this all, and becomes something more than just another ""Dead Men Don't Wear Plaid"" (a funny paraody but not exactly memorable), by employing something never seen before in film noirs: What appear to be living, breathing cartoons. That's right, cartoons. Seamlessly inserted frame-by-frame into the film are actual cartoon characters who interact with humans like nothing you have ever seen before - the quality of animation and interaction far surpasses such role models as ""Mary Poppins"" or ""Songs of the South"" - this is some of the best quality in both cartoon, film noir, and family entertainment in years - and maybe even decades.Though modern CGI presents wonderous images on-screen, it can also prevent quality from reaching through the celluloid - the feeling that what you are seeing has not just been splashed together messily, but has been shown unmistakable, painstakingly tiresome attention, detail and respect. Something like ""The Matrix,"" though visually dazzling, could never be done as well in cartoon format (can you just imagine Keanu Reeves soaring through the air fully animated?), and something like the animation in ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit,"" though visually dazzling, could never be used in a film like ""The Matrix.""Sometimes CGI can make one feel as if the process of getting what you are witnessing on the screen onto the screen was too easy for the filmmakers. How often did you step back from something like ""Bulletproof Monk"" and admire its beauty and magnificence? Something like the animation in ""Roger Rabbit"" has quality, you can feel it, it almost invigorates you. Every single frame of this film had to be edited, and cartoonists had to draw in cartoon characters by hand. 82,000 frames of video in ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"" were shown adamant attention - can you say the same thing about ""The Lord of the Rings""?""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"" went through about forty different script drafts, its villain once had a pet parrot named Vultar, and the five weasels seen at various points in the film used to be seven, named Greasy, Sleazy, Weazy, Smartguy (originally Smarta$$), Slimy, and so on. But it doesn't really show - there don't seem to be many flaws. Technically there are little, and plotwise there are little. It is a well-rounded film.The plot may be pointless to indulge in, but here we go. After an amusing setup involving a cartoon, the audience is suddenly thrown into a new reality so suddenly you almost have to do a double take. We are left aghast, shown an alternate Hollywood in 1947 - one alive with cartoons, or ""toons,"" as everyone in the film calls them. (After all, don't we make nicknames for races? Whites, blacks? Wouldn't the same be appropriate for cartoon characters if you had to repeat their species or race over and over as part of a daily routine?)In this alternate Hollywood, the cartoons have their own little place to live appropriately titled Toontown. It is the type of place where Walt Disney would have felt at home, as this alternate world leaps off the screen with comic liveliness and joy. But some of these toon inhabitants of Toontown have broadened out, leaving and going to work for Hollywood (one character in the film says, ""That Goofy is a genius!"").Maroon Cartoons is a big business in this alternate Hollywood, producing Baby Herman cartoons that co-star the jittery Roger Rabbit, perfectly and comically voiced by Charles Fleischer. Roger is a 100% toon. After being handcuffed to a gruff detective named Eddie Valiant (Bob Hoskins) and after Roger is then dragged to an area where Valiant can remove the cuffs with a saw, Valiant tells Roger to sit still, and so Roger squeezes out of the coughs. ""You mean you could have done that all along?"" asks Eddie. ""No!"" says Roger. ""Only when it's funny!""Parts of what make ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"" tick so in-tune, with perfect harmony, is that it is never obnoxious - Roger is not a stupid comic sidekick. He's a lovable cartoon character that could - and almost did - spin off an entire franchise based upon him. British Bob Hoskins fakes a great American accent. Director Robert Zemeckis (""Back to the Future"") gives a great film noir approach to the film. The animation is perfectly seamless. And the movie is funny.One of the things that struck me with wonder upon watching ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"" (along with the splendid animation and acting and direction and film noir), was that various competing cartoon characters were used in the film. In a shadowy bar Daffy Duck and Donald Duck perform a violent piano duel; soaring through the air with parashoots are Disney and Warner Bros.' most famous characters, Mickey Mouse and Bugs Bunny. And get this - not only are they in the same film, or even in the same frame together, but they talk to each other. How amazing is that? We will probably never witness competing cartoon characters, from a broad range of years, in the same film with each other ever again. I've never quite seen anything like ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit,"" and we probably never will again.5/5 stars -John Ulmer",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Comic Genius,"This started Space Jam, The Rocky and Bullwinkle Movie, Osmosis Jones and more movies that mix animation with live action actors. I loved the usage of the wacky looney tunes in the more innocent setting of the Mickey Mouse cartoons. From tweetie's cameo, to Roger's hero Goofy, to Porky Pigs's camoes, to these godfather like weasels, to Tinkerbell. Out of toon town they used elements from Italian-American hit movies. I loved Christopher Llyod as well as the role of Jessica's Performance Model. She is the most sexiest cartoon ever. Above all this is comic genius having a movie for adults using kid themes. It is a really good film.",,Anonymous,Animation
It's Disney's crowning achievement of the 1980s.,"Who Framed Roger Rabbit has become a bonafide classic in the exact same vein as films like Back to the Future and Chinatown; it shares the fun of both stories whilst taking its stories, contexts and characters very seriously and still manages to have fun with itself in laugh-out-loud ways. This is a film noir that happens to liberally borrow stuff from the Looney Tunes playbook, if they wanted Bugs to appear in Sam Spade stories. In short: it's self-aware fun that's homage, remix AND innovation in the same package.I could go on about this gorgeous film's legacy, its enduring appeal and how it revitalised interest in Hollywood's Golden Age of Animation like nothing else before it, but still; it's THAT good a movie, and it came from Back to the Future's Robert Zemeckis in 1988. This film plays with the film noir genre to the best possible and self-aware degree whilst taking its morality of truth prevailing in the end VERY seriously. It's a fantasy that relishes what it is and doesn't hold back, be it the cynical detective or goofy cartoon rabbit married to a supposed femme fatale (it's not as simple as that with Jessica Rabbit).Who Framed Roger Rabbit is a fantastic film that hats proven itself time and time again without fail, and it remains ceaselessly rewatchable thirty plus years on from its original release.This was an easy 5/5 star review for me.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

One of the best live-action animation films ever,This film was amazing. It was very entertaining and for a movie that on the surface might be for kids due to the 2D animation with the tunes it has a lot of adult themes which makes it a great watch for people of any age. The best part about this movie is the mix of real footage and animation. It was done extremely well and I was barely able to tell there was a green screen in most parts.

One movie that rescued a genre,"How often does one movie save an entire film genre?""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"" did more than provide a great entertainment vehicle at the theater. It literally saved an entire genre -- the full length animation motion picture. Sure, it combined animation with live production, but in doing so, it was also the grandfather of CGI, where decades later, entire segments of a film were spliced with computer graphics for both special effects and extended thematic elements.For it's time in 1988, it was a technological breakthrough, setting the bar for the time so high, that it stands well over 30 years later,, more than matching up with anything made using the latest in digital technology.The production, sound, and score are off the charts outstanding, more than enough to earn multiple Academy Award nominations and a few wins. It highlighted what was a deliberately boilerplate script and turned it into a magnificent 90 minutes of pure fun.In what ends up one of the all time scene stealing moments, the tour de force song sequence for Jessica Rabbit was a masterpiece of animation and live action integration, forming a truly iconic moment in film history.It's hard to say this film is great family fare, which may ultimately have been its only downfall. But, for anyone with a better than ""three year old dinky,"" it was filled with great laughs and original moments.It's an all time film classic, that paved the path for generations of animation films that followed it.

"""C'mon Roger, let's go home. I'll bake you a carrot cake.""","How could I not love this movie? As a kid who spent many Saturdays watching Bugs Bunny, Mickey Mouse or Hanna Barbera cartoons I was an audience made for this movie. At the tender age of 8 I remember going to the theatre to watch it with the family and everybody loved it! Directed by Robert Zemeckis who is also a director who when thinking of his movies I am not sure there was one of his I didn't like.R.K. Maroon (Alan Tilvern) thinks Jessica Rabbit (voiced by Kathleen Turner) is nothing but bad news for his big act Roger Rabbit (voiced by Charles Fleischer). So he hires Eddie Valiant (Bob Hoskins) to get some photos of Roger's wife to maybe get Roger's head back in the game. Thing is Valiant has got a history with toons and hates them. Once Marvin Acme (Stubby Kaye) is found dead guess who they think did it? You guessed it. Poor old Roger though he turns to Valiant for help.I think Hoskins is awesome in his role as Valiant along with the voice work of Fleischer and Turner is top notch.

This is lightning in a bottle!,"We will never see another movie like this ever again. So many animation/live-action hybrids have happened before this movie and many tried to capture the success of this movie, but none of them will live up to the masterpiece that is Who Framed Roger Rabbit. The techniques to how they've combined live action footage and animation under the brilliant direction of Robert Zemeckis and Richard Williams is astounding, especially how they did not use the computer technology we have today.

Never gets old.,"I had seen 'Who Framed Roger Rabbit' some years ago, around the time it came out. I watched it again yesterday with two teens who had not even been born in 1988. We all enjoyed it, and I had forgotten much of the story line. While it isn't the first movie to mix animated characters with live characters, it is arguably the first to do it in a realistic, 3-dimensional way. I remember seeing some 'making of' footage many years ago, pretty fascinating stuff.Edit 2019: I watched it again on BluRay from my public library, 15 years after watching it with the teens who now are 30, married and out of town. Brought back fond memories.SPOILERS follow, for my recollection, please read no further, OK!?There is an alternate reality called Toon Town, and the residents are referred to as 'Toons.' They actually come into our world to act in cartoons, and do all the dangerous things we see in cartoons without getting injured. Roger Rabbit is married to shapely Jessica (Kathleen Turner voiced) and is set up, 'framed', by Judge Doom (Christopher Lloyd of BTTF 'Doc Brown' fame) who in the end turns out to be a 'Toon' also. We learn that as he gets squashed by a steamroller, but then gets up, and re-inflates himself. Roger and Jessica live happily ever after and the bad Toons are destroyed in a mixture made by Judge Doom -- acetone, benzene, and paint thinner.",,Anonymous,Animation
"Smile, darn ya, smile!","First off, allow me to correct a common mistake that was made by more than one reviewer here: This is most certainly not the first film ever made where animated characters interact with live actors. Pete's Dragon (1977), Mary Poppins (1964) and Song of the South (1946) all predate it, and if you want a lesson in cartoon history, so does Gertie the Dinosaur (1914). But that doesn't mean Who Framed Roger Rabbit is not a landmark film. It was revolutionary for its degree of interaction between the toons and the human characters, done so perfectly that they seem completely natural at first glance, but then amaze when you take a closer look - little things like Jessica Rabbit pinching Eddie Valiant's cheek, or Roger Rabbit hiding under the water in Valiant's sink, or beneath his coat, little details that took very creative special effects to be made convincing. It's also unique and original in the fact that some of it takes place in the real world, featuring animated characters, and some in an animated world, featuring live actors; and in that manner, it predates Cool World, Space Jam and anything following.Who Framed Roger Rabbit is wonderfully funny, directed more at an adult audience than children. Bob Hoskins and Christopher Lloyd make a terrific impression in the lead roles, and manage to stay remarkably serious and convincing while conversing and interacting with entirely imaginary characters. Charles Fleischer is beyond brilliant in the voice of Roger Rabbit (as well as that of Benny the Cab) and Kathleen Turner as Jessica Rabbit is also terrific, a femme fatale so classic that it's ridiculous. The entire film excels with intelligent humor that would appeal to both children and adults, and it's a treat for animation buffs, with references to historical toons from the Foxy cartoons of the 20s, through Betty Boop, Dumbo and Bambi to Bugs Bunny and Mickey Mouse.Who Framed Roger Rabbit is one of the defining films of my childhood; I think that's true for almost anyone born in the 80s. I still have a warm place in my heart for Roger and Eddie Valiant, and a cold one for Judge Doom, who gave me nightmares for weeks after I saw it upon its initial release when I was four (he still gives me chills, by the way, when he first starts talking in his squeaky voice). If you somehow manages to avoid it, do watch it, and if you're willing, it's well worth the purchase, too.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
An Untouchable Classic,"As someone who doesn't particularly enjoy cartoons as much as I did when I was younger, it really says a lot when I look at a film like Who Framed Roger Rabbit as an adult and say that I absolutely love it. I was first introduced to WFRR when I was very young. (Probably 5 or 6 years old.) And I don't remember much from it, but what I can recall for sure is that I did enjoy it. But now that I'm grown up, I actually enjoy it even more.It's a phrase we hear all the time and more often than not, it gives us false hope that the film will be exactly as it promises: ""Fun for the whole family!"" they tell us. But most of the time, movies that try to sell by using this title are false advertising and end up as unmemorable failures for both young and old audiences. But you can rest easy because this is not the case with WFRR.For starters, the tone of the story itself is a masterful combination of family friendly humour and dark euphemisms that are so complex they will go right over a child's head. So adults can appreciate them without fear of their kids becoming tainted by suggestive themes. It is perfectly equated in the light as well as the dark side of humanity. And that is something that is not easily achieved by an ordinary film, much less one that is partially geared towards children.There's a whole multitude of things that I could give this film praise for. To name the best ones: there's the skillful animation, the seamless interaction of the human characters with their toon counterparts, the clever themes of a classic 1940's film noir that blend absolutely beautifully with the cartoonist nature of the story, the top-notch acting from Bob Hoskins, Christopher Lloyd and others; and last but not least, the pain-staking amount of detail made to every single interaction between man and toon. Over all, the techniques used worked to excellence and don't fail to astound even by today's standards. You can almost feel the animator's blood, sweat and tears through every great effort to convince us that these toons are real and are just as human as their living, breathing co-stars.Because I consider the film to be so nearly perfect, there is very little that I could complain about (and I don't think I could even if I tried!). Sure, there are some scenes that might come off as a tad out-landish or zany but hey...that's the nature of cartoons. And when used in combination of brilliant acting that's so faultless to the point that you constantly forget that the actors on set are interacting with things that never actually existed; it gives you a better appreciation for cartoons and 2D animation in general but also for the extremely talented cast who gave it their all to make these gimmicks a success.As a whole, the film is staggering in both technical achievement and story. It has a lot of heart to it, great humour and a wonderfully crafted script. If you're looking for a film that both fully grown adults and small children will like, this is the real deal. There's no false advertisement to be found here; you don't get any more genuine than this. Everyone should give Who Framed Roger Rabbit a watch because you won't find more fun anywhere else!",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
The Essential Modern Family Film,"It's been 20 years since Who Framed Roger Rabbit opened back in 1988. 20 years later the film is not just the granddaddy of modern animation, but it is also in my opinion, the essential family film of all family films in the current era. Who Framed Roger Rabbit truly set the standard for the personality that all other family films that followed after it, would have. The personality of Who Framed Roger Rabbit is a balance of the outrageous humor you see in comedies of the current era, and classic physical slapstick comedy performed by the classic comedians of the Golden Age of Hollywood.Roger Rabbit really kept that balance, it was not a film that only adults should see, and it was not a film just for parents with kids who want to take their children to a movie they want to see. Roger Rabbit was truly a movie for everyone in the family which includes parents with kids, and adults who do not have a family of their own but are interested in seeing this family movie with adult themes they can identify with or understand. That is how family movies today should still be like, not too child-oriented and not very adult-oriented, they should be a combination of a movie for the family and a movie for adults.Family movies should be presented in the middle between both types of film and they must never be just for kids or little kids. They have got to be for everyone to enjoy, and Who Framed Roger Rabbit set the bar for how modern family films should be marketed and who they should appeal to. Roger Rabbit truly defines what it means to be a classic family film.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Mice and Rabbits Unite,"Growing up as a kid, I had this stuffed rabbit doll that I used to sleep with at night and carry around with me everywhere I went. Since I was young, I never really got the name of the rabbit until I saw this masterpiece of a film and was blown all the way to the moon. Who Framed Roger Rabbit is not only a comical action packed suspense thriller, but a film which brings all our childhood fantasies to reality. Who didn't want to see Mickey Mouse interact with Bugs Bunny? Who didn't want to see Donald Duck throw Daffy Duck into a piano? Who didn't want to see Mary Poppins' penguins serving drinks in a nightclub? It's all stuff we imagined as youngsters, and this film brought it all together in a well paced, well put together, exciting, innovative, and most of all entertaining epic. It's undeniably one of my all time favorite animated films and one of my all time favorite films in general.I think what I love most about this movie is the way the human characters interact with the cartoon characters. The way Eddie Valiant (Bob Hoskins) picks up Roger and tosses him in the sink, pretending to do his laundry, it's hilarious and impressive at the same time, and I still question how they were able to pull off such an effect. The way Jessica Rabbit dances around Marvin Acme, tugging on his cheeks and taking the hat off his head, it makes you think the cartoon characters are actually there and not inked animated creations superimposed over the film. I also like the scenes where the cartoons interact with human appliances. The scene where Roger is drinking, he's drinking from a real glass and he picks it up just like a flesh and blood human would. The scene where Roger is smashing plates over his head, he's smashing real plates and not animated cartoon ones. The scene where the Toon Patrol tracks down Eddie, they are wielding real guns and not cartoon ones. What's ironic is that the human Eddie would wield a cartoon gun later on in the film.This film has the perfect blend of slapstick, humor, drama, terror and straight forward fun, which makes sense for a film involving cartoon entities. I love some of the jokes seen throughout the motion picture and the puns spewed from the mouths of some of the characters really add a bit of comic relief, even in the film's most horrifying of scenes. I really love Charles Fleischer's voice work as Roger Rabbit, but would you believe Paul ""Pee-Wee Herman"" Reubens originally auditioned for the voice. Although Reubens would have done a great job, I really dig Fleischer's voicing of the character, especially his PWWWWLLLEEEAASSSEEE! You gotta love that, for it's the character's most distinctive trademark and makes him stick out among other rabbit characters in the world of the Toons. Bob Hoskins is also phenomenal as Eddie Valiant and to this day, it's considered one of his best roles, although I'll always remember him for playing Mario Mario.But the actor who steals the show in my eyes is Christopher Lloyd as the slinky yet intimidating Judge Doom. Straight out of Back to the Future, Lloyd delivers a menacing performance that has you laughing and screaming in fright all at once. You really feel frightened by this dude, and although he is defeated in the end, he sticks out in your mind and has his cartoonish red eyes watching you in your dreams. He's just that chilling. Although the human/cartoon interaction and Lloyd are some of my favorite aspects of the film, my favorite moment of the film is the scene at the very end where the wall to Toon Town is broken and all our favorites come running out to get the spotlight. Literally, ALL our favorites are there. Mickey, Bugs, Betty Boop, Woody Woodpecker, Donald, Daffy, Goofy, Yosemite Sam, Pinocchio, Droopy Dog, even Peter from Disney's adaptation of Peter and the Wolf somehow squeezes in a cameo. My only gripe is that my all time favorite cat and mouse duo Tom and Jerry don't make an appearance, but that's just a miner nitpick.Overall, this is a perfect movie. This film clearly displays what films are made of or can be made of if a lot of hard work and ingenuity are put into them. This film clearly displays what fantasies and images of imagination are all about, and takes all the things we love about the Toons and blends them all together into one solid concoction. It also combines genres. One time it can be an action thriller, the other time it can be a romantic comedy, the other time it can be a horror film with Judge Doom drowning a Toon shoe in the horrid ""Dip"". It puts together a lot of stuff we love about the movies and when you set your eyes upon this film, no matter how many times you set your eyes upon it, your inner child is released and in no time, you feel like your in another dimension filled with flying elephants and reluctant dragons. AND DON'T FORGET THE FLOWERS AND TREES. This is a solid picture that I've seen so many times, and I still can't believe how magnificent it is.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
A Fantastic bit of Film!,"What a wonderful piece of entertainment.  Not only from the technical imagination that went into this movie, but it has a great plot.  Borrowing much from the old film noir genre of private eye flicks.  Tell me Bogart wouldn't have been perfect for Valiant.

Toon Noir,"Somewhere in Hollywood, sometime in the 40's, Jessica Rabbit bumped into Eddie Valiant. At this cultural crossroad of Howard Hawks, Bogart, Chandler, gangster movies, Warner's cartoons & Ayn Rand, Robert Zemeckis sets up his masterpiece 'Who Framed Roger Rabbit'. Elsewhere commentators have waxed about the technical brilliance of this movie, so I shall instead rave about the attention to details (the shadow of the Maltese Falcon in Valiant's office, the dead partner as in Spade & Archer of MF, the weasel's gangster movie patter) & the wonderful period feel (the tram cars, the bar, the studio lots). The plot itself is no great shakes - big business as the villain has been tackled successfully in many novels/ movies like Fountainhead & Big Sleep. But the sheer audacity of setting an alternate cartoon world with its own rules & morals deserves a round of applause. And the fact that he pulls it off so well is what makes this movie a classic. Add to that wonderful performances by Bob Hoskins & Christopher Lloyd, & you have a movie to watch & watch again.I saw this movie again on TV after it was first released when I was a kid, & the intervening years have given me much more to take out of this movie.

The apotheosis,"If there is one thing that is difficult, it's to mix live actors with animated characters. Well today, it could look easy with the development of computers and more and more sophisticated filming methods. But if there is one thing that is even more difficult, it's to proceed to the mixing at the point that it becomes homogeneous and where the unreal merges into the reality with an extreme subtlety.The year is 1988. Computer animation still is at a prehistoric level and the only way to do the famous live-action/animation mix, it's to shoot all live scenes and to add the animated scenes one by one. To make a feature-length movie that way could look crazy and utterly visionary, but producers Frank Marshall and Robert Watts decided to take their chance and hired Robert Zemeckis and Richard Williams, so they would direct what has become one of the greatest gems in cinema history.""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"" begins with an almost-completed animated short film starring Baby Herman and Roger Rabbit. However, when the director (cameo by Joel Silver) shouts ""cut!"", the film's wizards enter into action.The story is set in Los Angeles in 1947 and pretends to be some new form of film noir. Every film noir story needs an hard-boiled detective and this one is no exception with Eddie Valiant, perfectly played by Bob Hoskins.Valiant doesn't like the ""Toons"" which live in Toontown, an isolated borough somewhere in L.A., but he accepts an offer which gives him the mandate to spy on nightclub owner Marvin Acme and Roger's wife, the hypnotizing femme fatale Jessica Rabbit.What Eddie doesn't suspect is that he just got embarked into a palpitating adventure, filled with murder, lies and big-money business. Then you add the terrifying Judge Doom (Christopher Lloyd) and a conspiracy inspired from a real-life urban legend.""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"" is at the same time an homage and a parody of classic noirs from the 40s and the 50s and contains classic elements and others intended to provoke laughs and frenzy for the viewers who could only leave the theater with an open smile on their faces.Directing a film noir is already complicated enough, so imagine if you have to add animated characters inside. Fortunately, Robert Zemeckis clearly shows that he's the man for such a feature. Zemeckis shows that he has an overflowing imagination and he visibly has fun in making this movie.What more, Zemeckis et Williams use a technique and a philosophy both borrowed to Walt Disney himself : what's difficult isn't avoidable and even desirable. Both directors never try to simplify their task and the actors react with an immaculate professionalism, especially those who directly interact with Toons.The very complicated plot, the nihilistic environment and the lighting methods are worth the greatest noirs, but some characteristics (such as Valiant's shadow saying ""Bless you"" after the detective sneezes) attenuate this sinister landscape and make the film more attracting to people of all ages.But the main problem with the movie is precisely about the targeted audience. There is no doubt that ""Roger Rabbit"" is an adult film. But I have no doubt that some mature movie buffs will believe that it's a kiddie flick, just because of the Toons' presence. And this is definitely not a children's movie. The story is way too complicated, there's enough sex and violence to unleash an outcry and Judge Doom can become so disturbing that he could worry youngsters.However, I encourage adults to see this movie because they would bitterly regret it if they miss their chance. Adding to the already-mentioned elements are the brilliantly orchestrated action sequences by Zemeckis and his crew. The wild chase with Benny the Cab is stirring and the final battle in the warehouse gave me fun like I've rarely had before.Anyway, the entire movie gave me fun like I've rarely had before. It would take an entire dictionary in order to find all the appropriate terms to describe ""Roger Rabbit"". But words aren't necessary. You just need to watch it to experience a goofy orgasm which is the apotheosis of the live-action/animation mix.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
"No CGI except for Charming, Groundbreaking and Imaginative ...","Robert Zemeckis' ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"" is an enchanting masterpiece celebrating the triumph of film-making, with a level of quality in the same vein of groundbreaking cinematic treasures such as ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"" or ""Toy Story"", combining animation and live action with a perfect and delightful realism.I can't decently talk about the film without paying tribute to the men and women who accomplished this. Consider that each frame implies the use of 24 images per second, and multiply this by the film's length, then think about all the parameters, like the perspectives that influence the size of the animated characters, the light and shadows for the choice of colors, the way the actors must pretend to physically interact with non-existent characters, grabbing them, shaking their heads or having their cheeks pinched by them  and all that stuff without the providential assistance of CGI, totally hand drawn from A to Z, in a total respect toward the same kind of dedication that conducted the hands of the ancient cartoon film-makers, the result is the ultimate proof that perfectionism always pays. There are ""Mary Poppins"" and ""Space Jam"", but ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"" is a class on its own and 'special' is too weak a word to define the effects, they are simply magical.I'm so glad I was a kid when I discovered it, I still remember how mesmerized I was by the introducing cartoon, something that resurrected the spirit of the Looney Tunes, Tom and Jerry, Walt Disney or Tex Avery's cartoons, this universe that vibrates a sensitive chord in everyone's hearts. If you're a kid you love it, if you're an adult, it awakens the inner kid who saw these cartoons on TV, and if you're even older, it will get you back to the good old days when you saw them on the movie theater. Roger Rabbit, even as an original goofy, bubbling, creation, is the living allegory of this Golden Age combining many characteristics from Bugs Bunny, Screwy Squirrel, Tom the car with a certain Disney-like innocence, and after having been burnt, electrocuted, blown, and hit by a fridge, the film introduces, through an unforgettable plot twist, the co-existence between toons and humans in the real world. And the transition to this universe seems so natural that the surprise ceases immediately when we start following the hero of the film, Bob Hoskins as Eddie Valiant.And the choice of Bob Hoskins to play the sourpuss, no-nonsense, private eye, is a stroke of genius, as he perfectly conveys the everyday feel of the noir genre hero with a hard-to-conceal wound in his heart. In that zany and crazy world when you can encounter a clumsy mail-pelican riding a bike, a baby with a 50-year old man lust, giggling weasels or a crazy octopus serving drinks in a bar, Eddie evolves with an unshakable seriousness, highlighting its ordinary aspect, which is a great gag by itself. We would all love to go to Toontown but Eddie doesn't and this reluctance leads to a rewarding sequence when he finally gets into the town for an extraordinary moment, where a serious man suddenly lives under the cartoon's Law of Physicals. If Bob Hoskins played his part in a cartoonish way, this part wouldn't have been as exhilarating. Eddie Valiant is the perfect straight man of the comedic duo formed with Roger Rabbit, two opposite characters who'd go as far as getting handcuffed together.The handcuff even contributes to the most hilarious moment, when Roger easily gets his hand off after the danger is over and justifies that he couldn't have done it earlier unless it was funny. And the timing he chose was perfect! Roger Rabbit's philosophy of life, defines the whole purpose of cartoons, it's all about laughing and smiling. No wonder that the Cartoons' Golden Age coincided with the Great Depression era and World War II, when people needed to laugh, and when laughs were the perfect weapon to handle the harshness of life. And if Roger Rabbit could get a wife like Jessica because he made her laugh, well, it says everything about humor's value. And Jessica Rabbit as the sensual and voluptuous creature, proves that there are no limits for seduction, and I wonder how many men would rather have a creature 'drawn that way' than a real woman in flesh and blood. And if not the best character, she certainly makes the most spectacular entrance when she emerges from that curtain.And the beauty of ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"" is that the special effects always serve the purpose of the story. The film didn't forget to have a plot with its share of thrills, laughs, and even some dramatic moments you wouldn't expect. Honourable mention to Christopher Lloyd who proves again his unique talent to portray bizarre characters with an extreme convincingness, his portrayal of the sinister Judge Doom, makes him the perfect villain for such a creative film, hell, can you make a crueler villain than one who found a way to kill toons? and one of the most sadistic acts ever that would make my heart squeak of sadness.And the soul of the story is Eddie Valiant's reconquest of his lost sense of humor, a quest incarnated by one of the most immortal shots of the film, the last kiss between Eddie and Roger. And if I had to find an extra meaning to this kiss, it would be the expression of this profound love we have for these cartoons that enriched our childhood, and stood the test time, never losing their unique charm and universal appeal. And if only for having featured the two icons, Bugs Bunny and Mickey Mouse in the same frame, and the two greatest ducks in an unforgettable piano duet, the movie deserves the title of Best Picture of 1988.That's all, Folks!",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

A Hollywood treat and a technological advancement,"Who Framed Roger Rabbit features filmmaker Robert Zemeckis at his best. The combination of cartoons and real-time is something not done prior or after this film so successfully. It's a lovely and cheerful film that does not pretend to be anything more than pure entertainment. Zemeckis also keeps his film in check in the sense that he does not let the new technology overwhelm his film's images or storytelling. That is what keeps this one so effective and masterful, unlike many films in the 21st century. The animation put against the real-time looks amazing because it does not come across as fake or industrial, it looks real and that is what establishes our credibility, even when we realize how far-fetched this fantasy is.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

The toons fit seamlessly into the ""real world"", and Hoskins fits just as perfectly in Toon Town.

"Anyway you slice it, a classic.","WHO FRAMED ROGER RABBIT? is the most brilliant blending of live action and animation since MARY POPPINS. Robert Zemeckis proved to be a master filmmaker with this complex and masterfully edited cinematic gem about a 1930's down and out Hollywood detective (the brilliant Bob Hoskins) who is hired to prove a cartoon rabbit named Roger is innocent of a murder he did not commit. With the aid of crack technical people (the film won four Oscars for its technical mastery), Zemeckis has crafted a completely believable melding of real people and animated characters that is hard to resist. I love when Hoskins is walking through a movie studio and you see all these famous animated characters from the past walking around (he even bumps into one of the hippos from FANATASIA). There's a scene in a nightclub where all the waiters look like the penguins from MARY POPPINS and Betty Boop is the cigarette girl. Charles Fleischer provides the voice of the title character and his wife Jessica, who is human but animated (""Im not bad...I'm just drawn that way."")has the speaking voice of Kathleen Turner and the singing voice of Amy Irving. But other than the technical wizardry that is apparent in every frame of this film, the thing that makes it all click is the amazing performance by Hoskins, who plays the character totally straight as if her were in a real detective story from the 30's. It is his straight acting approach to these comical situations (aided by Zemeckis I'm sure) that makes this whole bizarre roller coaster ride come together. WHO FRAMED ROGER RABBIT? is, quite simply, masterpiece that should have won Robert Zemeckis an Oscar.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Such a fun movie!!!!!!!,"starring: Bob Hoskins, Joanna Cassidy, Christopher Lloyd, Allen Tilvern and Stubby Kaye.

Eddie, has to get over his anger after a toon dropped a piano and killed his brother in order to help.My review: This movie is so well done. The cartoons and the real people fit together almost flawlessly. The direction by Mr. Zemeckis is great and up to par with his other direction for films (like Forrest Gump). Bob Hoskins played the straight man role, but he was actually very funny. I thought all the real life performances were great and the voices had real emotion too, including Kathleen Turner as the sexy Jessica Rabbit.

funny business presented seriously.,"I delighted at the way the live actors and cartoons complimented each other and worked together in this show world. Some known cartoon characters appear here as well as stranger ones. It plays like a real detective mystery. The whole story or idea is based around a fantasy that I believe truly peps up the serious-like detective theme as it pretends tough, face-the-facts reality. The setting is centered in an animated world in which Roger Rabbit exaggerates the whole cartoon treatment to a high degree in my opinion and his stunts impress us and heighten the effect very well. As when he is taking a beating from his partner and counterpart Baby Herman. His girlfriend Jessica Rabbit reflects on us as a truly sexy lover had she only been real. One gets the idea that this movie is trying to reach a much broader audience by combining the two kinds of genres and this is proven by its large popularity. But the film doesn't get carried away with the hype, as there is not a lot of Roger Rabbit and his friends merchandise out there to be found. I rate it worthwhile watching by most people, including older children.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

Beautiful Blend of Animation and Live-Action,"Who Framed Rogger Rabbit is a classic in many more ways than one. It manages to successfully blend the two worlds of live-action and animated film. Perhaps the most intriguing thing about Roger Rabbit is that the film is surprisingly dark for a children's film, and it has loads of humor and the plot is magnificent. The acting is all but perfect and the animation is spectacular. The villain is cartoonish and evil and surprisingly poses a huge threat to all of the toons. You really get a spooky feeling of dread throughout the film, while it still manages to be fresh, light-hearted, and filled to the brim with humor.It was copied many, many times in such films as Looney Tunes: Back in Action, but nothing ever came close to the genius that is Who Framed Roger Rabbit?",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
I Want To Meet Goofy!,"Imagine a world where Bugs Bunny was your next door neighbor and Mickey Mouse came to one of your parties. That is the magical world of Who Framed Roger Rabbit, a remarkable movie, not only in the visual achievement of the film, but also it stars both Disney and Looney Toon characters. Produced by Steven Spielberg, rights owned by Buena Vista (part of the Disney empire), and directed by Robert Zemeckis, there is a lot of talent involved with this melding of live action and cartoon characters. This, of course, is not the first melding of people and cartoon, one just has to look back at Mary Poppins, but this is the most advanced convergence of real life and cartoon life. The story involves a cartoon rabbit actor, Roger, who is accused of murder. Before Judge Doom (Christopher Lloyd) took over Toontown (where all of the cartoon characters live, a town that looks like it came out of a child's nightmare), there was no way to kill a cartoon character. But Doom found a way to administer capital punishment for his citizens (by using paint thinner, or course) and Roger is on the lam. He finds aid in a drunk detective (Ed Hoskins) who spiraled down from the heights of the business after a cartoon killed his partner, his brother. The movie features the sexiest cartoon character since Betty Boop, who is also in the movie, in Jessica Rabbit, married to Roger. Why would she marry Roger Rabbit? Easy, he makes her laugh. The story is a pretty standard ""whodunnit"" movie, but the movie itself is much much more than that. Such a creative merge of hardboiled detective story and cartoons of the 1940s is a joy to watch. And the end of the movie discusses the zany ideas of ""strip malls"" and ""free ways"" in such a way to bring out some of the biggest laughs of the movie. A trailblazing movie is entertaining to a point, Who Framed Roger Rabbit has the plot to keep the viewer interested throughout the entire picture.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
A landmark in a very rare genre.,"The ideas of blending animation and real life cinema is a rare concept, I can count the number of films I've seen in this style on one hand and it's safe to say none of them come close to matching the quality of Who Framed Roger Rabbit.Bob Hoskins plays Detective Valiant, he was a man once renowned for taking on cases to help toons. Until one night in toon town when a mysterious character killed his brother by dropping a piano on his head, after that moment he decided to never work for toons again. That is until cartoon film maker R.K. Maroon hires him for a dirty job; to snap some compromising pictures of Jessica Rabbit to prove to Roger Rabbit they shouldn't be together. It's a simple start to the story, but it soon evolves into a plot of twists and corruption.The film is a great blend of genres, principally it's a film noir meets animation. Detective Valiant is the archetypal detective embroiled in a case much deeper than he first thought, Jessica Rabbit is the seductive temptress (Hey, she isn't bad, she was just drawn that way), and of course there is a murder to solve. It's all there, and more. There is a blend of zany cartoon comedy and adult humour, much of it is derived from gags on the animated characters themselves, you know Betty Boop not doing too well since they started drawing in colour! The opening scene could force most adults to turn the movie off within seconds if you wasn't aware of what was to follow, but give it a few minutes and you're introduced to a unique version of seedy 1947 Hollywood.On a technical level it's impressive. For a movie made in 1988 the cartoons blend in well enough, they aren't perfect but they aren't bad. When Valiant actually enters Toon Town it's a bit rough around edges, but you can forgive this given the age it was made in. What the film really excels in is the interactions the characters have with the toons, a lot of praise has to go to the actors for this. I can imagine how difficult it must be to carry a conversation with thin air, but Bob Hoskins manages to react to Roger Rabbit convincingly throughout the whole film. Christopher Lloyds Judge Doom deserves a mention to, he is possibly one of the creepiest villains I've seen, and at the climax of the film when the little twist to his character is revealed he becomes a genuinely scary sight.For some reason, the films ambitious concept and merging of genres just seems to work. Its fun and tongue in cheek nature mixed with its darker side make for a unique experience.7/10",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

A childhood favourite,"You would need a heart of stone if can't love Who Framed Rabbit Roger, a classic mix of live-action and animation which united Disney's classic characters with the Looney Toons.In an alternative version of 1947 humans and cartoon characters (Toons) live together in Hollywood. The Toons have there own home, Toontown, but there star in live-action films and can do almost anything. A high-boiled, heavy drinking Private Detective Eddie Valiant (Bob Hoskins), whom brother was murdered by a Toon, is assigned a case by a movie studio to take incriminating photos of Jessica Rabbit (voiced Kathleen Turner) and Acme Corporation owner Marvin Acme (Stubby Kaye) to get Roger Rabbit (voiced by Charles Fleischer) to focus on his latest movie. But when Marvin Acme is found dead Roger Rabbit is the prime suspect, with the sadistic Judge Doom (Christopher Lloyd) is determined to destroy the Toon. But upon further investigation by Valiant he discovers a wider conspiracy over the ownership of Toontown.With a budget of $70 Million Who Framed Roger Rabbit was a very expensive film for its time. Director Robert Zemeckis is known for using the most state of the art technology available to him. He uses it to great effect, blending live-action and animation together. For children they will enjoy seeing cartoon characters and live-action actors working together on screen and the over-the-top slapstick comedy that animation can offer. The animation is very much of the style of a Looney Toons cartoons that I used to watch when I was younger, with similarities to Tom and Jerry shorts. There is also pretty of verbal comedy and it does play on its crossover, like the rivalry between Donald Duck and Daffy Duck. But there is pretty for adults, with elements of film noir in direction, character and plot, strong in jokes of classic cartoons and filmmaking and excellent writing with it's plot and characterisation. There is of course also a nostalgia factor.Who Framed Roger Rabbit was Hoskins' first major Hollywood film and he does an excellent job as the serious Private Detective who harbours bitter feelings towards Toons. He plays the role very much like a detective with the usual backstory and problems: but ends up forming a partnership with some very zany characters. He also had a tough job because for the most part Hoskins had to act alone. He shows his comic side as well and with Zemeckis' skilled direction show a compelling backstory to the character. Lloyd was brilliant as the sinister, scary and sadistic villain: he truly captures evil and is more scary then most horror villains. His sadism is shown by ruthlessly killing an animated shoe which is enough to give people nightmares for weeks.A great family film.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
This movie is awesome.,"Sights and Sounds - This movie has some pretty good cinematography. Even better and more impressive however, are the effects. The cartoon characters are almost perfectly incorporated into the real sets in a ways that are actually a lot more impressive than what more recent films have attempted with modern technology. The voice acting and overall sound design are also pretty good.Characters - Though there are a few minor inconsistencies with characters, they're pretty entertaining and interesting for the most part. The acting is pretty good as well. Everyone clearly had great direction here.Plot - Though there are some dumb moments, this movie is overall very clever and entertaining.Rating - I'm not entirely sure why this movie was trying to go for a PG rating. There are lots of dark and sexual themes in this movie that could've been better explored with a higher rating. I guess its because this movie features child-friendly characters like Bugs Bunny.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Possibly the greatest animated movie of all time.,"""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"" is definitely a classic. It was the first movie to be a complete mix of live-action and animation, and it did it perfectly. Anyway, the story of the movie is: Eddie Valiant (Bob Hoskins) takes pictures of Roger Rabbit's wife Jessica playing patty-cake with another man. Roger is very sad to find this out, and the very next day, Marvin Acme, the man Jessica played patty-cake with, is murdered, and the cartoon rabbit is framed for the crime. Everyone is after Roger, including the evil, 'toon-hating Judge Doom (Christopher Lloyd).This movie was not only one of the most original movies at the time, it was also one of the best. It perfectly blends live-action with animation, the plot is very good and original, the voice acting and the live acting is great, and the movie is very funny. When I was little I loved this movie, and now that I'm older, I probably love it even more than I did. Partly because I now understand all of the adult humor in the movie, and because I can now truly appreciate how this movie was so revolutionary, and original for 1988.Another great thing about this movie is how many different cartoon characters from different studios are all seen on the same screen. Like on the scene where Daffy Duck and Donald Duck are seeing dueling pianos, or when Mickey Mouse and Bugs Bunny are actually seen together talking when Eddie is falling, or on the ending when we see many different cartoon characters together including Bambi, Pinocchio, Mickey Mouse, Minnie Mouse, Woody Woodpecker, Bugs Bunny, Donald Duck, Daffy Duck, Yosemite Sam, and many others.Well, I'd say ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"" is one of the top 5 greatest animated movies ever, and I'd say it is the best movie of the '80s, and it's easily the best live-action / animation hybrid of all time. I love everything about this movie. It truly is a masterpiece. It's funny, original, clever, and just plain awesome. Not only is it great to see so many classic cartoon characters in one movie, but even this movie's own characters like Roger, Jessica, and Baby Herman are great. I love this movie.Rating: 10/10 ""Amazing""",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Wonderful Film,"I loved this film as a child, I would watch it religiously each evening at 7pm (not sure why I picked 7pm, but that's when I put it in the VCR) when I was in grade school. As an adult I have found new enjoyment in this movie for its humor and high quality animation.Roger Rabbit brought back the slapstick and wild antics of cartoons from earlier years. I recall John K. mentioning at one point, that cartoons stopped being cartoons-- which I agree with. In the 80s although I loved them, cartoons shied away from from over-sized eyes popping out of heads, anthropomorphic animals getting flattened like pancakes, the iconic birds and stars around the protagonist's head, and of course-- faces transforming into steam whistles. Never in my life did I see a My Little Pony and Care Bears episode where characters exploded, caught on fire or were sucked down toilets-- and moreover, if it had happened, I don't think it would be written as something to laugh about.This film reminded audiences of the potentialities of animation to do something actors on film couldn't do. They can make us laugh because of the medium they are made with (i.e. it's much more funny in my own opinion to see a hand drawn cartoon character dance around, than watching Jim Carrey in ""The Mask"" dance to big band music).I digress-- anyways, WFRR played with the jokes and gags from older cartoons, many kids my age hadn't seen or cared for. My God-Children have seen this film, and they love Roger Rabbit and his ""girlfriend"" (they are three and four years old, still can't seem to remember that her name is Jessica ^^). There is a blend of art and reality that they've been exposed to--that has inspired new play.Hands down, this film was before its time. Finding a way to meld the world of animation and ""real-life"" is not an easy one-- and I hope that there will be more of our fuzzy friend on the big screen-- someday.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
The best live action/animation hybrid of all time,"This film was not only a visual delight, but it was also one of my favorite films for quite a long time. While movies today like Scooby Doo needlessly put 3D computer images with people, this film did a much better job with 2D images. Roger Rabbit had to be the best `New' character created in quite a while, even though he was supposed to be old and what not. With some great characters and plenty of cameos by some of the best cartoon characters in cinema history, this film still rates as one of Robert Zemeckis' best movies. Bob Hoskins and Christopher Lloyd were excellent in this movie, which was well acted all around.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
The one TRUE movie that's perfect for all ages.,"I use to love this movie, when I was kid. Everyday, I would put the video into my VCR, and just be entertained at all the wacky slapstick humor that went on, in this movie.As I got older, I thought I wouldn't like the movie like I had use to, when in fact I had appreciated the movie even more. It was then I knew this movie was the one movie that anyone can watch and still love it, even after childhood.Allow me to explain: When your a kid, all you see is real-life people and cartoon characters coming together in a silly who-dun-it, movie. That's it! However, once you get older, you begin to realize more than that. You see as to WHY Roger Rabbit was the one being framed. Who the killer is, and why s/he did it. Plus, the purpose to Eddie Valiant's brother being talked about throughout the movie. That, and the plot itself.I have seen other childhood movies, only to look at them and see it as a movie only meant for children, such as ""Wizard of Oz"", ""Willie Wonka"", ""Cinderrella"", and many others. But this movie stands out. This one doesn't always have those child-like humors, like the others do. I'm not saying that it's a bad thing to have that kind of humor, I'm only saying this movie is more down-to-earth, than the others.I don't know many movies have this kind of charisma that ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"" does, so believe me when I say a movie like this is something one can watch again, and again, even after childhood.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
An Amazing Hybrid of live action and animation but not perfect,"To get the various copyright owners to agree to the use of their characters and especially WB and Disney to work together was truly amazing. Note that Terrytoons, Superman, Tom & Jerry, Casper and Wendy are MIA. Most of the film is very clever, including the dropping of a safe and a piano as murder weapons, as Tex Avery and Looney Tunes might do. Jessica Rabbit was drawn without underwear? Daffy Duck swears at Mickey Mouse? Both are somewhat true, as animators can be quite mischievous. I dislike ""Dr. Doom"" and his ""final solution"" for Toons reminds me of something ""Uncle Adolf"" might do. It's cruel and almost ruins the tone of the movie. However the ""dip dispensing"" fire hose truck and steam roller is an amazing prop, having seen it at WDW a very long time ago when there it was called the Disney-MGM Studios theme park. Therefore, I can state that I hate the ""end"" of Dr. Doom, but basically love (most of) the rest of the movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Ahead of Its Time,"This film was so ahead of its time as far as effects go, that almost 25 years later, it could not be improved by modern technology. So much energy went into making sure that you believe this you are in a world where humans and toons can intermingle.While not the first film to mix live action and animation, the effects and animation teams made sure to break all the rules and didn't make anything easy for themselves. They had the camera moved so the toons were fully dimensional figures and the characters were subjected to extreme lighting so animators had to pay special attention to the toons' shadows. It's the kind of detail that would be lost on most viewers, but I dare any animator to find fault in the work done in this film. http://amandalovesmovies.com/2012/03/14/who-framed-roger-rabbit",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Creative and Unique,"In 1947, in Hollywood, humans and animated cartoon, a.k.a. Toons, coexist and Roger Rabbit is the great attraction of the Maroon Cartoon Studios. However, he is not concentrating well in the script and the owner of the studio, R. K. Maroon (Alan Tilvern), believes the reason is the rumors that Roger's wife Jessica Rabbit is having an affair. He hires the alcoholic private investigator Eddie Valiant (Bob Hoskins) to investigate the veracity of the rumors. Eddie was a top-rated detective that worked with his brother Teddy, who was murdered by a toon during an investigation, and presently he has hatred for toons. Eddie sees the show of Jessica at a club and photographs Jessican and Marvin Acme (Stubby Kaye), who is the owner of the Acme Corporation and the Toontown, playing patty-cake with Jessica in her the dressing room. When Roger sees the photos, he does not believe that Jessica was unfaithful and leaves the Maroon Studios. On the next morning, Marvin Acme is found murdered and Roger becomes the prime suspect. While at the crime-scene, Eddie meets the sinister Toomtown's Judge Doom (Christopher Lloyd) and his five weasel minions and he says that he intends to destroy Roger using the Dip, a chemical mixture that he invented. Soon Eddie learns from Baby Herman the possible motive that Acme was murdered and together with his wife Dolores (Joanna Cassidy), they decide to help Roger Rabbit and confirm the motive why Acme was murdered. But the question remains: who framed Roger Rabbit?""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"" (1988) is a creative and unique film directed by Robert Zemeckis. The combination of animated cartoon and film with an adult film-noir is fantastic, with several levels for children and adult understanding. Jessica playing patty-cake with Acme is one of the funniest scenes and Christophe Lloyd is hilarious as the sinister Judge Doom. ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"" was selected for preservation in the US National film by the Library of Congress. My vote is nine.Title (Brazil): ""Uma Cilada para Roger Rabbit"" (""A Framing for Roger Rabbit"")",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Just Brilliant!,"This film I've loved for years, and I can't tell you how many times I have watched it. When I was a little kid I watched for the cartoons and the funny jokes. Now I can realize just how great this film is. First off I love classic cartoons. I mean who doesn't. They are entertaining to kids, and adults can't deny that they love them too. Now imagine every and I mean every cartoon character you can think of from the golden age of animation in one film. Don't think it's possible? Think again. This film has everyone, and they even have WB and Disney characters in the same scenes together. It feels like a segregation of cartoon characters stopped and now we see everybody together. There is a hilarious scene with Daffy and Donald, and the two big guys from Disney and WB are in a scene together. It is simply amazing and it is a great feeling that will never truly be recaptured. As for the plot it is much more than just a near 2 hour cartoon short. It is a mystery, a thriller, a romance, as well as a great comedy. You really do get attached to the characters, and you get wrapped up in the mystery. It is a very well written story. Then there is the groundbreaking effects. When I was small I never thought about all the stuff the filmmakers had to do to do some of the stuff that happens in this movie. There is an ocean's worth of creativity involved. If you haven't seen these kinds of things done before you will have your jaw drop. ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"" is a work of genius. It revolutionized cinema and it is still inspiring to this day.4 stars out of 4",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
One Whaky Toon Movie,"Special effects are excellent in this movie. Mel Blanc did a bunch of the original cartoon voices he once did. Why didn't he do Yosemite Sam? Interacting the toons with real people made the movie that much more enjoyable. Christopher Lloyd was perfect as Judge Doom. Lloyd has proved that he can be a serious actor as well as a comical one. Bob Hoskins is great as Eddie Valiant, and did an excellent job with that straight accent. (This was before I knew he was British). I couldn't tell. A well thought out story.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
A wonderful tribute to the classic Cartoons.,"What can I say, Robert Zemeckis is a master in directing special affect based films.In many movies have we seen real life actor interact with cartoon characters, but no one get's even close to this movie. This movie will make you shake your head and think;""in the the world did they do that?"". Of course today we may detects some minor errors, but still it's a movie far ahead of it's time.Ofrcourse I have to point out, it's not exactly a movie for small children, this is for the adults, and teenager for that sake. The movie has it's obvious PG rating because of it's obvious references to sex, some very mild violence. And let's face it,the movie is about a Toon being framed for murder. Let's just say I wouldn't advice you to show to anyone younger than 10 or 9.The movie takes place in 1947, and is based on the idea, what if Toons were actors rather than just drawings. The Toons work for the film studios in L.A. but live in ToonTown, sort of like a mixture of a ghetto and a magical dimension. Let's just say, Toons don't have the same right as humans, since they're technically just drawings. The story basically is about he Toon Roger Rabbit who is framed for murder, and the private detective Eddie Valiant played by Bob Hoskins, who resent Toons for having killed his brother a few years back, is forced the clear his name. I won't spoil more so I'll just say that.Bob Hoskins interacting with characters that we all know isn't really there is just amazing. And how the Toons interact with the environment is even more stunning. Of course today, when we are used to CGI and such, finding some few mistakes now and then isn't hard. But believe this, after 10 minutes of this film, you'll stop looking, and who cares if there's a few mistakes the film is from 1988, it was way ahead of it's time.So if you're a fan of classic cartoons, or just want laughs and excitement and haven't seen this film; what are you waiting for, buy it, rent it whatever, just see it now. i give this movie a 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Amazing animation and superb special effects,"In what may be defined as one of the most innovative and creative approaches to film, Robert Zemeckis holds no boundaries and brings us an amazing tale that holds a place in Hollywood's Finest. The story itself shows us a life in that we all dreamed about as children: a place where cartoons and humans live side by side. That's when the dream world becomes a nightmare and the cartoons find themselves on thin ice. One of the most respectable cartoon characters from ToonTown, Roger Rabbit (voiced by Charles Fleischer) is wanted for the murder of Marvin Acme (played in a short but comical role by Stubby Kaye), the very owner of ToonTown and Acme cartoon products; yes, you can now own dynamite, portable holes, and super Toon glue in your very own home. Without justice for toons, Roger finds himself at the end of the drawing table and only one step away from the wrath of Judge Doom (Christopher Lloyd), who's only dream is to destroy ToonTown and everything in it. Out of desperation, Roger seeks help from human detective Eddie Valiant (played by Bob Hoskins in a landmark role). There's just two small problems: Valiant was hired only a few days ago to spy on Roger's wife Jessica, and things didn't look very good once it was discovered that she was playing 'pattycake' with Marvin Acme himself; also, Valliant refuses to work for toons, as his brother/partner was killed by a toon not too long ago (dropped a piano on his head). However, Valiant cannot turn Roger away (especially because now Roger's handcuffed himself to Valiant's arm), and agrees to take the case. Along the way, both Roger and Valiant discover a web of conspiracy linking Acme, Jessica, R.K. Maroon (head of Roger's cartoon studio), and the missing will of Marvin Acme that will ultimately decide who gets to run ToonTown. and whether or not it will end up just like its former owner.Who Framed Roger Rabbit brings to life the essence of murder mystery that became so popular in the 1940s, bringing out conspiracy, sex, lies, and murder in a dark tale that we watch with open eyes and find ourselves laughing the next minute. Unlike many other dark comedies, Zemeckis brings out the humor in decent proportion and reminding us that laughter can still be appreciated, even in a serious mystery. The movie also brings out a bright list of cartoon characters recognized by audiences of young and old, ranging from Bugs Bunny, Mickey Mouse, Woody Woodpecker, and introducing hilarious new characters such as Baby Herman, Roger's cigar-smoking partner in the cartoon business; Benny the Cab, a tough-talking taxi; Jessica Rabbit, showing us once and for all that just because you're a cartoon doesn't mean that you can't have serious sex appeal; and the Weasels, Judge Doom's gang of cartoon gangsters who do all of their boss's dirty work.Even with the superb list of characters, Who Framed Roger Rabbit showcases amazing special effects never before witnessed in film. While watching scenes where Roger and Valiant are side by side in the human world, the average viewer can almost believe that there really is a talking rabbit standing next to Hoskins (in the imagination, anyway). The interaction between the real actors and the cartoons is simply eye-popping and leads the way for an entire new branch of filming and animation. All in all, Who Framed Roger Rabbit is a legend of its own time and a simple reminder that children are not the only ones who can appreciate good animation.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
A Landmark in Animation,"Eddie Valiant (Bob Hoskins) is hired to take some naughty pictures of Jessica Rabbit and Marvin Acme. Soon, Jessica's husband Roger is framed for murder and Eddie -- the same man who just worked against him -- must help Roger prove his innocence and save Toon Town from being bought up by devious capitalist interests.This film combines cartoons with live-action actors, which is both the appeal and the strength of the film. While some moments are less than perfect, for the most part the creators did a fine job of showing how two-dimensional characters would operate in a three-dimensional world. Terry Gilliam has likened the film to ""Howard the Duck"" and of course many today could compare the movie favorably with ""Cool World"".The acting is fine all around. Bob Hoskins is great, and all the supporting cast are believable as people in a 1947 film noir world. Many other actors were rumored to be wanted for the role of Valiant, but I have a hard time seeing anyone pull it off like Hoskins did (which, in turn, is now the role he is remembered for). The cartoons are also okay for the most part, though some are annoying. Unfortunately, the most annoying is Roger. If they had to make a new character for this story, why did he have to be so incredibly irritating?The subplot of the ""freeway"" is nice. While I would like to think that there was a message in there about how globalization or rampant consumerism is bad, I am thinking that was not really the point and this was perhaps more of a throw away joke. And I do not deny I appreciate gas stations, rapidly-prepared food and billboards as far as the eye can see.I also take issue with Valiant's drinking problem. We never really see the problem (he passes out once, but is probably just tired). Yet, comments about his alcoholism must happen ten or twelve times. Show us, do not tell us. And the ""toon killed my brother"" line is great, but it is used like four or five times and we do not need to be reminded. If this were actually a children's movie, maybe they need the help, but I do not think even they are that dumb or forgetful.If you do not see this one, you might be missing out. If nothing else, it is a landmark in animation and set a new standard for how cartoons should look. But if you are from the 1980s or 1990s generation, this is probably already a part of your childhood and you are going to want to see it again for the first time. Maybe it is not ""The Land Before Time"" or ""Titanic"", but it is one of the more memorable films you are going to see... Bugs Bunny and Mickey Mouse together on one screen.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
See it for the story,"I wish people wouldn't keep on praising this movie's effects, because, as anyone who's ever gritted their teeth at the thought of yet another summer sci-fi blockbuster knows, all the spectacular effects in the world add up to nothing without a meaningful story, individualized characters, and some wit -- all of which ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"" does have, which will probably ensure that people will still be watching it when new technological advances have made its tricks as obsolete as ""King Kong""'s.  One of the movie's greatest achievements is its meticulous and loving creation of an alternate world, a dream-L.A. that never existed but in some ways is better than the real thing, an homage to the imagination of old popular culture.  It also slips in some criticism of domination by big corporations (an odd thing for a movie coming out of the studio system), by contrasting, in the viewer's mind, the L.A. of the movie world with that of today, which is precisely what Cloverleaf Industries wants to create.  Indeed, the corruption associated with the building of the freeways was a real event in the 1940's, so the fantastical elements gain immediacy by not utterly straying from reality, just as the toons seem solid by interacting with humans.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Why it rocks:,"It is perhaps the most iconic animated/live action film ever, perhaps even more so than Toy Story, The Lion King, etc.The movie brings a creative idea, where what if cartoons are real and they exist in the same world as real life people.The film has an incredible concept based on a surreal style of humor.Both Disney and Steven Spielberg had the ultimate collaboration.It has the biggest crossover of cartoon characters in animation history, featuring various popular classic cartoon characters from various animation studios from the Golden Age of American Animation (1920s-1960s). In fact, almost all the animation studios from the Golden Age of American Animation at least have one or two of their characters make cameos in this film.The film is known to crossover Mickey Mouse and Looney Tunes characters in various iconic scenes, the most well-known scene is where Eddie is falling in Toontown and he meets Mickey Mouse and Bugs Bunny, making it the only time we see the two most famous iconic things in cartoon history from rival companies be together in one place, another example is a scene where Donald Duck and Daffy Duck are playing the piano, only for Donald to start having one of his anger attacks because of his strong dislike for Daffy, but characters from other studios appear, which is pretty creative.Very creative, inspired and beautiful animation which was drawn by Richard Williams.Speaking of which, Roger Rabbit is a perfectly well-drawn and established, toon protagonist to work along side the more serious-minded Eddie in a plot about an crime which resolves with saving toons.Judge Doom, the film's main antagonist, is a well-known character who was a toon, who was very scary for children that, a few years later, they remembered him as one of the greatest villains.Awesome and convincing advanced special effects to combine both of the animation and live-action, even much more better so than previous animated/live-action hybrids produced beforehand, thanks to Industrial Light & Magic making it look incredibly imaginative.The opening sequence looks like a very great 1940s-style Chuck Jones-esque cartoon.The characters are capable of delivering a lot of fun and strong memorability.There are many Easter eggs in the film that can be spotted.It is a love letter to cartoons, film noir, and the Golden Age of Hollywood along with the Golden Age of Animation.Fantastic musical score.The ""That's All Folks!"" gag in the end of the movie fits the cartoony appeal of this movie.It spawned 3 cartoons of Roger Rabbit and Baby Herman due to the success of the movie.Like the fully-animated feature film, The Great Mouse Detective, the success of Who Framed Roger Rabbit? Helped reignited the general public's interest in animation after the Dark Age of American Animation of the 1970s to the mid-1980s caused the American animation industry in general to go downhill for two decades, as well as inspired the animation industry to return to quality in the 1990s, including the launch of the Disney Renaissance beginning with Disney's The Little Mermaid the following year and the release of many popular fan-favorite television cartoon shows with higher production values and broader audience appeal as opposed to just younger children like The Simpsons, The Ren and Stimpy Show, Tiny Toon Adventures, Animaniacs, SpongeBob SquarePants, and many others.It spawned the inspiration of Bonkers, which was originally a Roger Rabbit Spin-off before becoming it's own thing.""STOP THAT LAUGHING!""",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

One of the great joys in this movie is seeing a lot of our favorite cartoon characters together for the first time. Like when Daffy Duck and Donald Duck have a warm up act together on stage, or when Bugs Bunny and Mickey Mouse go skydiving together.One of the most effective things in this movie is it's vilain. Judge Doom is one of the creepiest bad guys I've ever seen. I love it at the end when you learn what his evil plan actually is; All through the movie you think that Doom is an evil mastermind, and at the end, it turns out that his evil plan is completely idiotic. Doom is played wonderfully by Chris Lloyd, who is one of the greatest actors ever.The plot is AWESOME. It took me years to fully understand it. It is a great mystery and the surprises never stop.

Cartoon noir?,"I never realized it as a kid, but this film had more innuendo than you could shake a stick at - or carrot.Disguising his British accent effortlessly, Bob Hoskins plays a down and out 1947 circa detective who was once a great champion of cartoon stars until his brother was killed by one. He is asked by animation film maker RK Maroon to trail cartoon owner Marvin Acme, who owns ""Toon Town"" and take incriminating pictures of him to show to a popular yet hapless cartoon rabbit by name of Roger (RK is Roger's boss and lately Roger can't seem to concentrate). The subject of the pictures: Roger's ravishing red haired wife Jessica (voice of an unbilled Kathleen Turner) with Marvin Acme! This understandably rattles Roger, who thinks his wife is ""Betty Crocker"", even though she happens to be a sultry singer at the Ink & Paint Club. But when Marvin turns up dead, Bob is forced to help Roger find the real culprit when Roger is believed to be the killer, which clashes with his image as the hapless straight man/rabbit to the crude, cigar chomping yet adorable cartoon character Baby Herman. But who IS the real culprit and why did they do it? And can Bob solve the case and save Roger before he is destroyed by the inhuman Judge Doom (Christopher Lloyd) and his cartoon Weesles?Loaded with gags, in joke references to both 1940s cartoons and the film noir private eye detective films that starred Humphrey Bogart, and making an almost seamless blend between live action actors and animated figures, this is one of the most entertaining pieces to come along in the history of cinema. Bob Hoskins holds his own admirably while playing 2nd fiddle to the hapless Roger and his cartoon pals.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
"A big, cartoony heart, it offers more on every viewing","""Smile, Darn Ya, Smile,"" sings every cartoon creature in Toon Town, in the over-the-top second act production number as Eddie drives into town. It is a song from a 1931 Friz Freleng cartoon. The whole countryside is singing, including the trees, the sun, the flowers and the birds. It is so ridiculously happy, so infectious and outrageous, you can see how a sourpuss like Eddie would be annoyed. But it makes me incredibly happy each time I see it. It's exactly what cartoons represent in this movie -- pure joy.It is a wonder that such unbounded silliness can suddenly bring tears to your eyes. I speak of the scene when Eddie Valiant is flipping through some newly developed photos, to find pictures of his dead brother and partner, taken before he died.The movie does not play this scene for cheap sobs, but tenderly and humanly. Eddie shows little emotion on his face, and the music is sweet and simple. Suddenly we know what everyone was talking about when they said, ""A toon killed his brother."" The photos show he was more than a brother. The slow pan across his brother's desk show his whole life, just as Hitchcock did for Jimmy Stewart's character in the first scene of Rear Window. The story? Here was a business partner who had shared Eddie's successes (successes now lost in dust and drink), and a best friend who could hang out at the beach with Eddie and his girlfriend, sing, drink and have some laughs. He was someone Eddie probably didn't know how much he loved until he lost him. Now he was alone, his business gone, and his life over. He couldn't return to his old work -- Toons -- because that was the world of joy he had lost. He thought that joy had betrayed him.The extravagance in details, especially the small ones, are what sells this movie. The sets and costumes are sumptuous. And the humor is in every line and gag. It's pretty funny to see Eddie snag a free ride on the back of a trolley car with a bunch of school boys. It's more funny when Eddie hops off and thanks the boys for the cigarettes.The melding of the real world and the cartoon world is brilliant. Cartoons have a natural effect on their surroundings. Cartoon logic makes complete sense in this picture; when Judge Doom tries to trick Roger out of hiding with his ""shave and a haircut"" routine, it's hilarious because it's true, and it's suspenseful because it's true. It's perfect.It is an homage to every cartoon ever made. The saxophone player and the dancing brooms giving a bow to Fantasia... And a swell, multi-level gag that most people miss: When Eddie takes pictures of Jessica ""playing patty-cake"" with Marvin, the two *really are* just playing patty-cake. What a gag. But when Roger flips through the photos, they move so quickly that the actions in the still photos become animated. What you are looking at, in fact, is the very first kind of cartoon -- the animated flip-books that once sold for a few pennies, long before the first movie was ever made. It hearkens back to the earliest days of cinema and animation. It's simply sublime.This movie does have its flaws; it drags during the warehouse scenes, for some reason. But watch for the many sub-references to the world of cartoons, and the rich sets, the beautiful color, the flawless editing, the physical humor.

Wow all around...,"A film noir involving corporate intrigue and wacky animation? Who wants to see that movie??Who Framed Roger Rabbit is the story of Eddie Valiant, a detective who was once famous for tackling 'toon cases along with Teddy, his brother and partner. However, he slips into a life of alcoholism and odd PI jobs after Teddy dies at the hands of a 'toon. But everything changes for Eddie when he is hired by R.K. Maroon, a cartoon studio executive, to investigate some funny business (no pun intended) involving 'toon star Roger Rabbit and his wife Jessica.This film is a marvel, both artistically and technologically. Its special effects still hold up today, 20 years after the film's initial release. If this were all Who Framed Roger Rabbit had going for it, that would be pretty amazing. However, the film also has spot-on performances and a great story and script. A film with such artistic *and* technical merits is really something special.For me, Who Framed Roger Rabbit is also amazing because of how differently I have been able to see it over the years. When my 5-year-old self first saw it on its initial home video release, I loved the colorful world of Toontown, Roger's antics, and seeing my favorite cartoon stars side-by-side in the same movie. (Donald and Daffy in the same scene? That was heaven!) I did, however, run and hide from certain scenes later in the movie that I do not want to spoil for those lucky souls who still have yet to see this. As an adult now, I still love the movie as entertainment, but I can also appreciate all the work that went into its creation. It only takes a viewing of the DVD's special features to see that making this film was a painstaking process. Not to mention, in this age of computer animation, realizing that all the animation in this film was done by hand! Wow!Who Framed Roger Rabbit is a technological marvel, an artistic triumph, and an extremely entertaining film. Highly recommended, especially for animation lovers.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Brilliant horror,"The eighties' classic and technical marvel Who Framed Roger Rabbit, for all its singing, dancing animals and deliberately toonish direction, is above all a horror movie. A chilling, twisted, bizarre and surreal experience which is unlike anything released before or after it (that I've laid my eyes on, anyway). The interaction between man and toon is enough to make you uneasy, as it in my opinion just looks plain wrong. Animated characters should stay within their animated environments; in the real world, their slightly unreal presence is like something out of a bad dream or hallucination. But it is in the film's final scenes, in a genuinely shocking twist, that the true nature of Roger becomes clear. Take my word for it, this is in no way a film for children.(On a completely different note, Betty Boop definitely should've had more screen time.)Acting and voice acting is solid. Christopher Lloyd is superb as always, an underrated actor, seemingly born for this type of role. I don't think it would be hyperbole to call Lloyd's Doom one of the best on-screen villains. The Doom character is one of absolute inspiration and originality, and a part that could only have been done justice by someone with Lloyd's understanding of the material. With only a handful of scenes, he leaves the strongest impact on the viewer. Especially his final scenes are nothing short of unforgettable.If you haven't seen the film yet, you're probably skeptic. I know I'd find it hard to believe that a film about a goofy rabbit with a speech impediment could be unsettling. But it is, and if you watch with an open mind, I guarantee that you will be as weirded out as I was.Now please, don't get me wrong; Roger Rabbit is both a functional murder-mystery and a chuckle-worthy comedy, and both elements are competently handled by Zemeckis (at the peak of his creativity here). But to me, who was in the presumed target audience by the time I first laid eyes on the film, Roger Rabbit will always be a spine-chilling creation. It is horrifying, and it is a must-see, for those who are ready to tumble down Zemeckis' warped rabbit's hole.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Timeless classic,"I always loved this movie during my childhood when I used to watch it often on VHS, and after finally re-watching it yesterday after many years I still had the same feeling. Since there are more than 300 reviews I'll be brief.In an Hollywood where cartoons co-exist with humans, a toon rabbit is framed for the murder of executive R. K. Maroon. It's up to Eddie Valiant, despite at first he is reluctant to prove his innocence and save him from Judge Doom and his weasels.Everything about this movie is great. The animation is great as usual with Disney and Warner Bros, and it's actually the only film in history where their characters shared screen time. The acting by Bob Hoskins was good, but Christopher Lloyd as Judge Doom is probably the best part of the film: he is so hysterical, so malicious and yet so funny that you can see that Lloyd really put much of his energy for playing such a character. Also the soundtrack is memorable and fit the movie's atmosphere well.Despite is not really a movie for small children under the age of 5, it's still a family movie classic for any time of the year. Greatly entertaining and fun.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Movie that broke all barriers and came out a classic,"I admit that I was reluctant to see this movie, I couldn't picture live action and animation in the same movie. My brother bet me $50.00 that I would love this movie, long story short was the best $50.00 I ever spent. This movie was amazing and the technology was over the top. Though the real stars were the cartoon characters the live action stars were incredible. Jessica Rabbit was made to be every boy's dream, Eddie Valiant was the washed up drunk detective, Deloris Eddie Valiant's girlfriend and Christopher Lloyd as the judge is over the top. Disney and WBS cartoons sharing the screen together was a major breakthrough in cinema history. It has been done before but not on this scale.There is something for everyone in this movie, cartoon characters and their weird tactics to keep the kid's happy and a great who done it detective story for the adults. The casting was perfect and the chemistry between each actor and cartoon character was on spot. I loved the whole concept of this movie and everytime I watch it I'm beyond entertained. Even Space Jam didn't come close to this movie in fact this movie actually is in a field all it's own.Here we are now 2022 34 years later and no movie has ever been made of this concept that was even remotely good. Why this movie was nominated for a Oscar for movie of the year is shocking as it took movie making to a whole new level. I highly recommend this movie as it will entertain and amazingly stood the test of time. Yes it's in my collection and watch it often.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
There's a reason this is called a classic!,"Oh my goodness! What can I say about this movie?! This film is absolutely incredible! I would say that it is the pinnacle of the live-action/cartoon hybrid genre. It masters visual storytelling to a tee. The acting, comedic timing, and plot are superb. The music is amazing as well. It gives a great detective movie vibe. The characters are lovable, silly, and cartoony (of course). It's a shame that we are never gonna get anything like this again, because this is such a wonderful treat. If you love those old cartoons of the 1940s, you are going to love this movie.

We Need a Sequel,"It's been 30 years as of 2018, and there needs to be a sequel! Who Framed Roger Rabbit is one of the greatest collaborative films ever made; with cartoon characters from every major studio in Hollywood. But a sequel is very much needed and wanted.The idea of a sequel has been talked about and discussed by the original writer of the book, Gary K. Wolf and the producers of the original film for some years now. The story of Roger and Jessica just can't be left as it ended in Who Framed Roger Rabbit. The original characters of this film, along with the established characters makes for a great time.As for Bob Hoskins, Eddie Valiant was one of his best and most famous roles. I believe he was meant to costar with a toon, no matter how much his character seemed to hate it in this film!",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

Other than that, this movie is a lot of fun, is very near and dear to me, and it holds up extraordinarily well. A classic, for sure.And wow does it fly by.

Amazing,"Really cool concept in this movie that stills holds up, maybe it has some minor problems when rotoscoping stuff but the animation in 10/10 specially at the beginning.The Toon Town part of the movie is a very well done high point of thwe movie. At first I thought it could have more cameos, like the Chip n Dale movie (2022) but that movie was about that, WFRR is not about how many characters you can recognize, and still you have Warner Bros and Disney mixed.I don't remebered seeing this movie as a kid, or not all in one run.I liked and thought it was wierd to see Mickey Mouse and other icons in such a dark movie, where cartoons die, there is an alcoholic detective and everything is ugly.I usually give 10 stars to movies I can rewatch over and over, and in this case I haven't done it, but I sure will

One of the 10 best films of the '80s,"""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"" is one of my favorite movies of the 1980's. This is a truly original movie which combines live action with animation, and the result looks incredible. Bob Hoskins gives what has got to be the funniest performance of his career as a private detective who gets involved with cartoon character Roger Rabbit when the hyperactive toon is framed for murder. Director Robert Zemeckis has repeatedly said that ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"" was the most difficult movie he's ever made, and by the looks of it, I can easily see why. He did an excellent job with the live action part of the movie (like when a toon is holding a real gun; in reality it's a real gun hanging on a wire). He was unfairly overlooked by Oscar voters; he should have gotten an Oscar nomination for Best Director (six years later Zemeckis got revenge; he made ""Forrest Gump"" which he got nominated for and won the Oscar as Best Director). The special effects (which did win the Best Visual Effects Oscar) are remarkable. The cartoon animation (by Richard Williams, who won a special Oscar for his work here) is spectacular. Everything about ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"" is perfect. It's a dazzling motion picture that will never be topped in the department of putting live action with animation together. A great movie.**** (out of four)",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
The Ultimate Toon Caper,"Wouldn't it be great if cartoons lived among people in the real world? Imagine how different the world could be. Honestly, it might drive a few people insane, but I believe the majority of us would be totally fine with it. Well unfortunately, that kind of fantasy isn't around so in place of that, we have this movie that honestly would make every single cartoon lover fall over with happiness. Just like The Avengers (2012) where that contained all the favorite characters, so does this - all one's favorite cartoon characters are all in one movie.What's interesting is that this movie plays like a regular detective movie but with cartoons. This is a unique step because any film after that to incorporate cartoons into their story would be just to stop an evil mastermind with a supporting human character that just didn't give the audience the believability they needed to have the best connection with. So this story does take place in the 1940's, but, that's when times and the technology used was simpler and crimes were solved with just a few clues. The plot revolves around a cartoon star named Roger Rabbit who ends up getting framed for homicide.Leading this investigation is a troubled detective named Eddie Valiant (Bob Hoskins) who has a tragic history. Together, when these two are paired up, it makes an interesting watch due to how well this whole movie was made. And it's not just this duo that makes the film an interesting watch. Along with the set of famous cartoons that have their own cameos in this picture, comes a bunch of new characters that also display their own charm. The Weasels, Judge Doom (Christopher Lloyd), Baby Herman and several others are an interesting bunch of cartoons.The most astounding element to this film is the animation and puppetry used to make the cartoons look as lifelike and three-dimensional as possible. It is by far, the most convincing live-action special effects ever done for a live-action cartoon film. It may have been done for the other films to come after, but it just doesn't match the quality here. The effects just look so much more real. Also the musical score provided by Alan Silvestri may have not been special in a sense that it provided a main theme for Roger Rabbit, but he have one for Eddie Valiant and much of it were jazzy tunes involving bass lines. This helped support the period that the story takes place. However, the music was a little short on running time. But either way, it must be seen; it has Warner Brother and Disney cartoons sharing the same frame!If one wants to experience a cartoon ensemble movie, this is the one to see. The acting is superb, the characters are lovable and it has a great story.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
What we have here is absolute brilliance,"Who Framed Roger Rabbit? is one of those films that only comes around once in a blue moon. The special effects in this movie are simply amazing, mixing animation with humans was no easy task but in the end, it worked out beautifully. Another high point is the acting. If you didn't know better, you would think the animated cartoons really existed. Bob Hoskins gave a Oscar type performance playing Detective Valiant. Even the soundtrack was executed to perfection. This film is a must see for any Disney fan. It is a shame though, that they did not give this film a decent DVD conversion. A classic like this deserves much more than it received.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Fantastic play with the genre!,"One of Spielberg's & Zemeckis' best movies
Linking of cartoon and live action not only gimmick, but actually driving the action
Eddy serves usual detective noir tropes but also is a very sympathetic character and a hero you love and understand from minute one throughout the whole movie (maybe a new genre: cartoon noir ;-) )
Amazing that Disney characters & Looney Toons appear together
Beautiful cartoon sequences like in Tom & Jerry/Donald Duck/Looney Toons (whole movie is a bow to the cartoon genre Spielberg & Zemeckis grew up with)
Great play on genre in Toontown, countless references to other filmsVery much fun and entertaining.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
A Technical Marvel,"A technical marvel, animated virtuosity of the highest order, a film that still inspires awe even after all the digital advances that have followed it. Ostensibly directed by Robert Zemeckis, his presence is barely felt, overwhelmed by both the special effects and the overload of famous cartoon characters interacting with humans in this noir-ish fantasy of a forties Hollywood bordered by a ghetto populated with the animated characters of the period, used by the studios as a work force and treated as second-class citizens. Zemeckis' anonymity isn't much of a problem as the sheer ambition and comprehensiveness of the project makes it all giddily worthwhile; you can't stop loving the seamless mix of live and animated action. That said, the film is a bit too fast-paced and needlessly confusing and lead Bob Hoskins, as the private detective hired to investigate the murder of a human by `toon' Roger Rabbit, doesn't always acquit himself well, trying too hard to hide his British accent and embarrassingly made to act the buffoon towards the end. It's easy to see why the film can be considered a classic while Roger Rabbit himself remains far from legendary: as voiced by Charles Fleischer (who also voices several other characters as well), he's annoying, unfunny and instantly forgettable. Much more memorable are the characters of his sexy wife, Jessica (voiced by Kathleen Turner) and Christopher Lloyd as the villainous Judge Doom--they're delightfully tacky, carefully crafted and have a complexity that Roger fails to deliver. Many of the cartoon cameos are voiced by their original actors, including Mae Questel (as Betty Boop) and Mel Blanc (as most of the Warner Brothers representatives).",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
A still to this day one of a kind movie,"A once in a lifetime kind of movie we´ll probably never see the likes of ever again. It feels so surreal and it´s own through and through. I love Who framed Roger Rabbit so much. After rewatching it for the millionth time, sure you start to notice the basic writing and obvious set up/ payoffs and some of the animation that doesn't hold up quite as well, but I can easily look past that and really love this movie for what it is. Highly unique, fun and so interesting.Eddie Valiant is put on a case to prove what the wife of a cartoon rabbit named Roger is doing. After finding out what happens behind close doors, a murder happens, and someone is clearly framing Roger. Eddie wants to help Roger clear his name and get to the bottom of a weird case.There are so many great performances in this movie. The real-life actors really had to hunker down and act towards pretty much nothing for most of the time and that is incredible. Bob Hoskins really sells his role and makes the toons come to life with his reactions and body acting. Christopher Lloyd also really sells his role as Judge Doom. He overacts the perfect amount and makes the character so scary and well done. But my favorite performance Charles Fleischer as Roger Rabbit. He really sells this funny and good doing rabbit to a T, and really makes you fall in love with him. He is an unserious character in a very serious plot, and he becomes this perfect contrast character. Other voice performances are hit or miss here but Fleischer really hits it home.The animation at display is so incredible and blends so well with the real world. While some aspects haven't aged as well, some scenes still look so incredible and magical. Seeing toons interacting with real life objects looks so surreal and it works wonders here. In general, every character is so expressive and really pops in this universe. There are also iconic crossovers here that really made history for many. Donald and Daffy interacting together, Bugs and Mickey, scenes that are now iconic and will probably never really happen again or at the very least never capture the same magic as in this movie. A thing I really love is that the characters seem to just live in this world, it doesn't seem like a big Warner Bros or Disney advertisement, but more just the characters living and interacting in this world.In general, this world feels so highly unique and why I love this movie to bits. This overly serious world with poverty, noir detectives, murder and sex coexist with funny and goofy cartoons. The blend clashes so much and I love it. It makes the tone and movie just feels like it´s own and like nothing I have ever seen before. The noir vibes and the crime plot really work here and is interesting and the silly and funny animation parts doesn't ruin it unless it´s on purpose.I really loved the score for this movie. It´s cliché and sounds like any noir crime movie, but it sounds incredible in this movie.This is a movie that blends hyper seriousness with comedy and cartoon gags. It really shouldn't work, but the script really lends itself to heighten the weirdness of the movies nature and really deliver on both the humor and the seriousness. I think what sells it is that the movie acts as if this is just how it should be, as if the world just is toons and normal people living together. It doesn't make you question it or explains it which really works.The plot is rather simple and just your classic private detective story. There is a lot of set ups that are really obvious, and the beginning is one big lore drop. The character arcs are also obvious, and a bit rushed as well as a bit too perfect ending in terms of coincidences. But it works for this movie because of it´s premise and I still think the mystery works and is fun to solve, even though you can do it rather quickly if you can put 2 and 2 together.Who framed Roger Rabbit is to me an iconic one-of-a-kind movie that I just love so much. Sire it´s story isn't the most complex and it can be a bit clunky and poorly edited at times but overall, I am sold on the premise, world, and characters all throughout. I am entertained from start to finish and the movie delivers on humor, originality and mystery.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
An absolute classic.,"WHO FRAMED ROGER RABBIT?It has been a long time since I saw this movie. I loved it when I was a kid... and I still love it today!The first movie I saw in 2014... and it is a classic!The film is about a private investigator who is hired to take a few photographs of a singer who is accused of cheating on her husband, TV star Roger Rabbit. But when a few photos starts a bigger investigation into murder the case soon hots up.This film was a complete break through in movies. There has been a few movies where live action was mixed with animation, but this was so far ahead of all of the others that the others were not in the same league.The whole film is so well done. The way the actors mix with the cartoons is amazing and most of the time you can't really tell they are not looking at anything. The whole cast did a fantastic job.The film stars Bob Hoskins. Bob is a legend and it is a shame that he has retired. For me this is his best film. Other cast members were Christopher Lloyd. Christopher played Judge Doom. A judge that has found a way to kill ""toons"". He actually plays quite a scary character. I remember watching this as a kid and thinking he was freaky. Especially at the end of the movie. Joanna Cassidy was also one of the main characters. The voice work was awesome too. Charles Fleischer is the voice of Roger as well as a lot of other characters. Charles has had a great career so far. He is in a lot of movies that I have seen and didn't know it was him! Kathleen Turner is the voice of Jessica Rabbit. Every single person in this film was brilliant.The story was like something I had never seen before. This film brings back so many memories for me. It is one of my childhood favourites and will stay with me my whole life. I will watching this film again and again. I will never get bored of it... I can't wait until my baby girl is old enough to watch it with me. I want it to be a part of her childhood too.The main thing I love about this movie is the characters that were put together... The classic Warner Brothers short characters, Buggs Bunny, Daffy Duck, Yosamity Sam etc, all on the same screen as Disney classics Mickey Mouse, Minnie Mouse, Donald Duck... even Dumbo! Betty Boop, Tweetie Pie, Daffy Duck, Goofy... the list just goes on and on.I honestly love this film and have nothing bad to say about it. Every single child should watch this film... they would love it.I am giving this film 9 out of 10.""I'm not bad.

One of the Greatest Family Films of the 80's!,"When Who Framed Roger Rabbit was released in 1988, the film was a major breakthrough for the film industry. For the first time, human characters and cartoon characters were able to share the screen together and look real. Compared to today, the visuals may not seem impressive. But back then, this was unheard of and a risky move that paid off. As for the story, this film has a heart, is funny, full of one-liners, and is one the entire family can enjoy.Robert Zemeckis film is about how a toon-hating detective was hired to investigate an affair that Roger Rabbit's wife, Jessica was having with Marvin Acme. But after Acme was found dead, Roger was accused of murdering him. But after Roger pleas to the detective, he uncovers scandal after scandal.The acting is pretty good for the most part and I'm sure it was challenging to play these roles. Bob Hoskins does a wonderful job as the detective. But even better as the Judge was the menacing Christopher Lloyd. I think he managed to give every kid who saw this film nightmares for weeks.Overall, Who Framed Roger Rabbit is a break-through movie of the 80's and a family film that has a big heart. It was nice seeing some great cameos from the likes of Bugs Bunny and Daffy Duck. If there is a film to bring back some childhood memories, this is the film to watch. A magnificent family film indeed. I rate this film 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
"oooh, look! Stars!","Great for it's imagery, Who Framed Roger Rabbit is a perfect nostalgic piece from the 80s for those who grew up watching it.Oddly enough, Roger Rabbit serves as the middle chapter of the Back To The Future trilogy considering Robert Zemeckis & Bob Gale didn't do much in between BTTF and BTTF2. Not only that, but it was filmed primarily at Pinewood studios, just as Batman was being made.It is normally extremely difficult to render live action with cartoon animation, especially for the actors. From what I've heard, Charles Flescher actually did rehearse with Bob Hoskins in a big rabbit costume.Next to the cartoons, Christopher Lloyd as Judge Doom is another big part of the movie. As a theater trained actor, he is extremely good at what he does and gives that creepy vibe. Not only that, but he had to work with the animation for his big scene near the end of the movie.Great piece of work. It's something that I could watch again and again and again. Also goes hand in hand w BTTF if you're into watching multiple movies in a row.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Unbelievably impressive,"This movie has gone down in history as one of Disney's greatest comebacks. The 80s were not so good for Walt's legacy and the corporation was struggling to make films of true quality. And then they came up with this little gem. Seamless incorporation of live-action and animation, astonishing technical innovations, a cavalcade and gathering of beloved animation characters unlike anything they audiences had seen before. It was a revolution and largely helped launch Disney's Renaissance, their greatest golden age to date.And it has endured the test of time remarkably well. This film is older than I am, but its message of acceptance, endurance and the ability to face the world with a laugh is still as relevant as it was back then. It's a timeless movie, and even though it is known for its technical achievements, its story has enough depth to stand on par with them.The characters and actors are also delightfully varied and played by topnotch actors. We have the no-nonsense, deadbeat, humourless private detective Eddie Valiant (Bob Hoskins), who still manages to deliver some of the best punchlines through his deadpan delivery. We have Roger Rabbit (Charles Fleischer) and his wife Jessica Rabbit (Kathleen Turner), who manage to be an effective and heartwarming couple despite their differences, or perhaps because of them. And then we have Judge Doom (Christopher Lloyd), who could not be more perfect for his role, especially keeping in mind the ending. All these characters have great chemistry together, they all have great lines and together they're a riot of laughs, action and humour.Who Framed Roger Rabbit is definitely worth a watch for the whole family. Its animation, charm and humour will appeal even to the youngest, yet its story has a message that will provoke thoughts even from the worst critics of these so-called kids films.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

Detectives with a twist,"At first glance it's very easy to write this film off as a mis-match of two completely different styles, which come together to create a unrealistic and polarized world. But when you actually watch the film, and experience the attention to detail and incredible writing it becomes very clear that this unlikely match is exactly what makes this movie a classic.First of all, considering it's age the integration of live action and cartoons are astounding, and still surprise me to this day. The design of the characters is perfect, and the voice acting leaves no stone unturned, taking every essence of each character and finding just the right match.And while wildly different genres can be easily described as wacky, or insane, the director manages to pull off a murder mystery featuring cute and lovable cartoon characters, and does it incredibly well. The story is airtight, and the writing reminds me of every detective story involving dark offices, and smoking etc.Sure, it's not perfect, the ending leaves a little to be desired and the line between fantasy and reality does occasionally thin a little, but overall this film is smart and very well produced. If you haven't seen it already, do, and if you have but are considering experience this old gem again, I highly recommend it.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Often imitated, has yet to be equaled","I watched ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"" so often growing up, and few movies from that age still maintain this level of (re)watchability. It's so well-worn, yet still entertains on a surprising level.And really, what's not to like about this movie? It's imaginative, colorful and a little bit insane; like stepping into an alternate reality. That mix of a beautifully-realized 1947 Los Angeles and manic toon world is well handled and makes this a great place to spend 100 minutes in. The animation is first-rate; luminous and mingles believably with the human world (and vice versa). It's a technical marvel, but really, the key to all of this actually working is Bob Hoskins. He does the legwork and makes you believe that he's really talking to a toon (and not a placeholder for ink-n-paint to be added later).To this day, this is still one of my favorite movies, and one of the very best I've seen from Disney. The craft that's on display here is highly polished, and treats like this do not come along often.Especially these days.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

Brilliantly imaginative,"Today on ""Matthew Praises"", I will laud the crap out of WHO FRAMED ROGER RABBIT. First of all, I have seen/read about movies that combined live-action with animation. ANCHOR'S AWEIGH (1945), remember when Gene Kelly danced with Jerry the Mouse from Tom and Jerry. MARY POPPINS (1964) where Dick Van Dyke danced with animated Penguins. Not to mention BEDKNOBS and BROOMSTICKS (1971), where Angela Lansbury turns an animated lion into a rabbit. This movie perfected the technique and the art. Give it up to the great Richard Williams. Aw man this guy is awesome. His book, THE ANIMATOR'S SURVIAL KIT is a great book and he frequently references this movie he was involved in. Richard Williams nails the who's who of cartoons characters from various companies (such as Disney, Warner Brothers, Universal, MGM and Paramount not to mention lesser known ones), it's a shame that Popeye, Tom and Jerry, Little Lulu and Casper the Friendly Ghost didn't make it. Mr. Williams nailed not only Roger and Jessica Rabbit, but all the other characters given their proper 1947 look/style. It is fascinating and is worth it for the aspiring animator/animation student. Now going back, I say that this movie is funny and sugar-coated at first, and later it turns dark, dramatic and grim. No wonder this movie won an Oscar for Best Special Effects. To me, this was the KING KONG or STAR WARS of my childhood. All in all, it is a pretty good (family appropriate) movie. Kids will love it, adults will love it. There was planning for a sequel, but it didn't get made. Plus, this movie, akin to JAWS, KING KONG and STAR WARS, was imitated. In other words, studios made cash-in attempts, that looked nearly close to it. COOL WORLD (1992) starring Brad Pitt and Kim Basinger, with animation by Ralph Bakshi. EVIL TOONS (1992) starring David Carridine, is a Fred Olen Ray film that is the love child to EVIL DEAD and ROGER RABBIT. Sadly, the cartoon-animated beast gets a small amount of screen time and there is too much hot-girly action. I am glad that my parents didn't let me see THAT movie. Avoid it. Italy made VOLERE VOLARE (1991) by Guido Manuli and Maurizio Nichetti looks like what one critic said, ""ROGER RABBIT adult style"". However, there were no other movies that exploited the combination between live-action and animation (cartoon animation not CGI). Still, SPACE JAM (1996) and LOONEY TUNES BACK IN ACTION were the last films to do it. Please read my reviews of LOONEY TUNES BACK IN ACTION. With a movie like that (WHO FRAMED ROGER RABBIT or LOONEY TUNES BACK IN ACTION), it makes me wonder and think, ""Don't you wish they would make more movies like that?"" I highly recommend it. Rated PG for violence (normal and cartoony), mild language, and some sexual innuendo. This has been another ""Matthew Praises"". After you read it, don't you wish for more ""Praises"" instead of ""Rants?""",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Not to be rude but,"Nice source and usage of animation and action. The actors/ actresses were all good at their role. But the one thing that I noticed was the music.

Well anyway, for anyone who wants to see this movie or it just catches their mind, I recommend that you give it a shot. because i sure as heck did, and it was the best movie that I have ever seen!!!!!!!!!!

"Original, Funny, and Nostalgic - a truly ""magical"" film","This movie is a masterpiece. An incredible achievement in special effects and film editing, Who Framed Roger Rabbit, even 25 years after its original release in 1988, has stood the test of time and become a film near and dear to my heart. I grew up with this movie, and the cartoons peppered within, and seeing this movie again just makes me yearn for the good old days of fantastically violent cartoon comedy. It's filled with lighthearted laughs but isn't afraid to be darkly comical, and Zemeckis walks this tight rope act perfectly. It features an original and surprisingly great film noir story, phenomenal animation and strong performances to boot. There isn't a moment of live/animated action that looks fake; it all feels tangible and real, which is the real achievement (and amazing that 25 years later it still looks fantastic). It's also incredibly sad that we will never, ever get another movie quite like Who Framed Roger Rabbit. Cartoons have changed, and so has Hollywood. Who Framed Roger Rabbit is one of the finest examples of ""movie magic"" if I ever saw it, and I will defend that to the day I die. I may be wearing my nostalgia on my sleeve a little, but I can truly say that this movie has aged phenomenally well and is truly a masterful film.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
not sure who the movie is marketed to,"i didn't think this was a good movie.i can't pinpoint exactly why,but i can tell you i was bored out of my skull.it was much too slow moving,and i didn't find the gags funny at all.i'm guessing children would like this movie,but i think even most teenagers would be bored,but i could be wrong.truthfully i'm not even sure who the movie was marketed to.i mean,there are some funny cartoon moments that kids will probably find hysterical.and yet a lot a lot of the content is very adult oriented,especially a lot of sexual innuendo.however,i think it would be too slow for many adults.visually it's nice to look at,but that is not enough to maintain interest for very long.if you have kids who are preteen or younger,they will like this movie,yet it may not be suitable for them.i certainly wouldn't call this movie family friendly.i would have given it a PG-13 rating,at the very least,maybe even MA for mature audiences(14+.)anyway,parents should really use their discretion with this movie.overall,i think Who Framed Roger Rabbit is a 4/10.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

A Timeless Classic That Combined Live Action and Animation,"In the year 1947. Eddie Valiant (played by Bob Hoskins) is a detective living in Hollywood, where cartoon characters and humans co-exist with each other. Hating the cartoons (or toons, as they're called) as his brother was murdered by one, he is hired to go spy on Jessica Rabbit after R. K. Maroon wants to wise up her husand, Roger, after he is flubbing his lines, and the studio head heard Jessica is cheating on him, however, Roger is soon framed for the murder of Marvin Acme, the man Jessica is cheating with, and the will to Toontown goes missing as well. Eddie has to protect Roger, as he is hunted down a gang of weasels led by Toontown's sinister court judge, Judge Doom (played by Christopher Lloyd).This film is one of the best of the 1980's, and it's proven. A murder mystery involving cartoon characters, the film achieves a technical feat allowing the toons to be in a live-action setting, a great technical feat, as while past movies did this, this was for a scene or two, this one does it for the whole movie, using methods that would allow the special effects crew to edit in the toons. While this is more for older kids and adults, as it does have some language and content parents may not want to expose their kids to, it is a legendary movie, with a good story, acting, and most of all, it has cameos from cartoon classics like Mickey Mouse and Bugs Bunny.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

There are so many iconic moment in this masterpiece.,"Who Framed Roger Rabbit (1988) is a movie in my DVD collection that I recently rewatched with my daughter on Amazon Prime. The storyline follows a world where humans and cartoons live together. When the head of Toontown is murdered a private investigator with his own past with toons is hired to investigate who murdered him and why. When a rabbit with motive is identified as the likely killer, the investigator hunts him down to get to the bottom of what is going on and why.This movie is directed by Robert Zemeckis (Forrest Gump) and stars Bob Hoskins (Mario Brothers), Christopher Lloyd (Back to the Future), Charles Fleischer (Zodiac), Joanna Cassidy (Bladerunner) and Kathleen Turner (Serial Mom).There are so many iconic moment in this masterpiece. The animation mixed with the humans is so well done. The opening animated movie is fun and Jessica Rabbit is red hot. Hoskins was the perfect anti-hero. The character evolutions was awesome as was the entire storyline and how they mixed the Disney & WB universes. The piano sequence between Daffy and Donald is legendary, as are the Bugs and Mickey Mouse scenes. The Weasels and Lloyd were perfect villains. There is nothing to not love about this film.Overall this is an all time great picture that is an easy 10/10. I would strongly recommend seeing this.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

A true masterpiece doomed to ignorance (screen) (vhs),"Except « ice age », it's the only animation with which I remember to laugh so much and so hard : the opening cartoon ranks among the most funny ever done and this Roger Rabbit is really a wonderful character, goofy, crazy, with a good heart ! The idea to mix real world with Toon world is original and the production is astounding in both situations and it's even done when digital effects weren't there ! There is a real story, worthy of a film noir and this Golden age Hollywood is nicely done. The cast is excellent with late Hoskins totally believable and an amazing dark side « Doc » ! Silvestri delivers a jazzy, upbeat soundtrack as good as « BTF » and for sure « Looney Tunes » meeting Disney is a dream come true !However, all this is lost as tears in the rain because it's totally old-fashioned ! For a movie aimed to a young audience, it's a total failure because it has nothing that the new generation likes ! As it means a lot for me, i offered it to the kid years ago and he didn't smile a lot : old Disney, Looney Tunes, Hollywood, jazz means nothing to him and watching a dusty, drinking private investigator really didn't appeal to him.

Predicated 911,"Steven Spielberg was on a roll in the 80s... first ""Jaws"", then ""Poltergeist"", then ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit?"" Which ones best? That would be the most recent one. This one. It's a cartoon about a busty broad who's married to a rabbit (reference to f-ing like a rabbit, rabbits have lots of sex), and she wants to get off one and the subway system is taking over the whole country as a metaphor for the federal government/Illuminati/Anton La Vey's Church of Satan. There's a lot of crude jokes at the expense of the bunny in this movie.The main selling point of this movie is the special effects, which have actually been trumped by more recent and similar fair such as ""Ted"" and ""Ted 2"", which are better movies because they are more recent... but still, I've heard it said in the school of film criticism that it is important to pay tribute to the past, and give the old movies perfect scores for trying. With that said, I think this film tries very hard but a lot of it looks terrible. Similar to how movies like ""Toy Story"" look terrible now even though it sold as a gimmick in the old times because it was a movie made with computer technology. They didn't have computers in the 80s, but this movie has other kinds of special effects like putting fake puppets into the movie.Bob Hoskins from ""Super Mario Bros."" makes a cameo in this movie as an old-fashioned detective, and he gets his fair sure with the TITular broad. The main character is actually played by a rabbit, and it's a Pee Wee Herman type show when he's involved, and he actually smells a lot. The movie made a lot of money back in the day, and it was kind of a big deal because you could buy a lot of merchandise. A little known fact is that the movie is actually based on a book, and in the book Roger Rabbit was a comic book character instead of a cartoon character. He's a metaphor for a black minstrel which is why he is portrayed as sub-human.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Imaginative fantasy setting,"In 1988 I  waited in anticipation for this film to come out when I heard that Bugs Bunny and Daffy Duck were going to be on screen with Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck. A truly historic meeting. So when the movie started and we enter the Ink and Paint club right behind Valiant to see the ducks in the Lizst piano duel--I literally had goose bumps! The whole idea of Toontown was brilliant-like a cinematic mythology-and the story worked well.  I dont think of it as a comedy however---the jokes were rather few and far between. I found it to be more of a dark fantasy--as exhibited by the disturbing scene where the peaceful toon shoe gets ""dipped."" I realize that last line must sound ludicrous to those who havent seen it--if you havent, you should!  By today's fx standards the film's special effects seem flat(in most scenes)--but unlike say, Jurassic Park, it has a decent story to fall back on.Joe Dante is said to have been among the candidates to direct it. Although Zemeckis did a fine job, i think Dante would have brought more humour to it(and Terry Gilliam, more depth).A couple of points of interest: one--the novel has a VASTLY different storyline and conclusion. Second--although Felix the cat could not be enlisted for the movie(he wanted too much money), if you look closely above the entrance to the Toontown tunnel--you can see a face marking it that looks  very familiar.Overall i think WFRR created a cartoon mythology that was quite inspired--if only some more non-Disney and Warners toon stars could have been included!",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Cartoon Noir,"This was such an amazing piece of work when it came out. I just saw it again, and it was just a bit dated. But while the physical part of mixing cartoon and live action was excellent, the best part was the writing, the envisioning of a world where interactions between ""toons"" and humans were commonplace. Fantastic work by Bob Hoskins, particularly in losing his English accent and sounding completely like a bitter, hard-boiled, mid-40's, SoCal, PI. Most of the time, when an actor fakes an accent, it will bleed through a bit in some scenes. One could blame the director for this, not being willing to take enough takes to make sure that he never has to use one that doesn't sound right. But Hoskins was utterly Streepian here.Interesting that some felt there were themes of racism and genocide in this movie. OK, I guess the genocide angle is fairly explicit, except that it never really occurred to me because the ""toons"" weren't seen as human. (Although now that I think about it, the weasels were depicted as having souls) But it's just too much of a stretch to see ""toons"" as being analogous to ""coons"". I cannot imagine Disney or Zemeckis going there at all. ""Toons"" were, in this film, gently treated as subhuman, simply because they WERE subhuman, and nobody was interested in denying that reality out of some sort of cartoon political correctness.Anyway, this film is a masterpiece, even if a silly one, and it comes highly recommended by me.

"A perfect mix between cartoon, dark, adult themes","This movie is a nostalgia for many. Watched when I was little for the cartoons but really never grasped the adult themes. Many dark parts especially when they are vaporizing the cartoons. It looks so good for a 1988 film which puts to shame nowadays films. A perfect mix between a serious detective 90's film and a funny adventure cartoon, not too long too so it doesn't get boring. There are many references to every cartoon and kids won't really see the adult parts in this. It's a adult movie made in a lighthearted way for kids.

A classic for all ages,I liked this movie as a kid and even know as a young adult I still enjoy it not as much as I did as a kid but there's jokes I appreciate more now other i appreciate less it's just all around a really solid movie. There's definitely some stuff that I don't think full sit right with me it's hard to describe but I think upon viewing people would agree. The only other complaint is I feel the villain was kinda obvious for a movie named who framed Roger rabbit. Like it's supposed to be a mystery but it's really not. Other than that what can I saw I think it was revolutionary for its time. The animation is really clean the world feels lived in it's really nice and cute.

Who Framed Roger Rabbit: 8/10,"Who Framed Roger Rabbit doesn't have a question mark at the end, because it's supposed to be bad luck. And that's what you'll have if you don't see this film.Private dick Eddie Valient (Bob Hoskins) works in a Hollywood-esqe place, nex to ""Toon Town"", where cartoons live. His brother was killed by a toon, and Eddie never found out who did it. So he hasn't gone near Toon Town since. But when he takes pictures for R.K. Maroon (Alan Tilvern), owner of Maroon Cartoons, where Roger Rabbit works, of Roger's wife Jessica (an uncredited Kathleen Turner) playing patty-cake with rival cartoon maker Marvin Acme (Stubby Kaye). Soon Acme is dead, and everyone thinks Roger did it. But only Eddie knows the truth.Who Framed Roger Rabbit is a landmark film, put simply. The combination of live-action and animation is perfect; sometimes you don't even know that the toons aren't real! When sparks fly, you see the punches hit the animated guys; it's a perfect set. Most of the time, animated films don't get nominated for any Oscars. Who Framed Roge Rabbit got three and an honorary one.But be warned, this is not really a kid's film. Sure, it's got Roger Rabbit, Daffy Duck, Mickey Mouse, and everyone else from the WB and Disney shows, but its plot is so intricate, the kiddos will just be waiting for the next character. Keep in mind, a lot of the time there is a cartoon character in screen, and there is a visit to Toon Town, but they won't be able to follow the plot (I'm still not sure if I get it!).The characters are well-developed, even if they are intoduced only for this movie and are ""unknowns"". Hoskins is very good as drunk Valient, his ability to interact with ""other actors"" is pretty good (or scary, take your pick). Christopher Lloyd, one of my favorite actors, is great as Judge Doom. Try comparing him to himself in 1985 in Back to the Future. See a giant difference? I do, at least.To sum it all up, Who Framed Roger Rabbit is a marvelous achievement of animation blended with reality with terrific performances with lots of humor spreaded into it to make a fine, healthy picture that gets better every time you see it.My rating: 8/10Rated PG for some language, cartoon violence, and hard-to-follow plot",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Relax Eddie, it's ToonTown","What can be said about this movie?Who Framed Roger Rabbit does everything correct, and it had the fortune of being made by Speilberg's protege three years after he completed Back To The Future and six years before Forrest Gump ran through the Oscars.As one might expect from the director of Back To The Future, the effects in this movie are amazing -- I would go as far to say some of the best in the history of cinema.The only perceivable ""flaw"" is that the whodunnit is obvious, but that was never what the movie was about. No, not movie -- film. This is a film. There were no shortcuts taken; thank heavens this was made in 1988 and Roger had to be animated by hand, because I imagine how artificial a 3D Roger Rabbit would look, move, and possibly even act.This is not to say 3D can't be done right (see Coco), but an eccentric character like Roger works better when he is given the freedom to move in a way computers do not yet allow. Computer animation, even now in 2022, is restrictive.Bob Hoskins essentially acts alone half the time, but it's hard to tell. I have always had a fondness for character actors over ""stars"" who show up in a movie looking, sounding, and moving like themselves 90% of the time. Hoskins disappears into Eddie Valient. Even ""method acting"" darlings like Christian Bale lack the range of a Bob Hoskins. Had Mr. Hoskins delivered a subpar performance, this film would've failed.The story is filled with ""Chekov's guns""; the plot seamlessly introduces elements that play a larger role in the final act. We, the audience, understand so much about toontown in a natural way. The expositional dialogue is antithetical to a movie like Inception.But what is most memorable are scenes where Looney Tunes and Disney characters share the screen. I can't imagine the reaction people must've had seeing this movie in theaters 1988.A word of warning to parents: don't let the PG rating fool you. This is a 1980's PG, so think of the film as a soft PG-13.82.63/100.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

Masterpiece with loose hinges,"As a hard-boiled, 1940s detective (Bob Hoskins) tries to touch bottom on a case, his life intersects with some of the world's most famous cartoon characters. And he hates it.""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"" is an improvement (correction: a vast improvement) over its source novel. The novel has a few good ideas the movie bypassed, but novels always do. Nevertheless, the idea for the movie is sheer genius.Christopher Lloyd, who seemed to pop up everywhere worthwhile in the 1980s, was born to interact with 'toons (as they call them).""WFRR?"" was a truly groundbreaking pre-CGI achievement, and something of a masterpiece. Yet it has lots of niggling little annoyances for me. While I loved it when it first came out, saw it more than once in the theatre and bought the videocassette, I didn't replace it on DVD. Why?First, and this is totally subjective, I'm no Bob Hoskins fan. He is a good actor, or he couldn't do what he does. And he's a good height to interact wirh 'toons. But when I recently learned Bill Murray was sought for the part I could only sigh for what might have been.But I can't review what isn't there.Second, because of the wrangling between Disney and Warner Brothers (Looney Tunes), Uncle Walt long ago having been filed away in his cryogenic vat, major characters of those companies (Bugs Bunny/Mickey Mouse, Daffy/Donald Ducks) had to have equal screen time; and the best way to put them on a stopwatch was to have the pairs share screen time. The ducks come off slightly better, but the whole set-up screams contractual obligations.Besides the usual 'toon suspects a few surprises are lurking here and there. I won't spoil them. They're often better than the big boys.Jessica Rabbit. I yield to no one in my appreciation of feminine pulchritude, but come on! Though she was perfectly voiced by an actress considered sex on a stick 40 years ago.This landmark film has a lot going for it. It's brilliantly made. But the further it recedes in my rear-view mirror the more its faults seem on display.And it's still not for kids.

This movie walked, so 'The Mask' could run so that every green screen superhero could fly.The movie is visually fantastic; I love the character & set designs. Bob Hoskins is a legend. There are so many iconic scenes. The music, practical effects and production value have the qualities that I miss in modern film.The cigarettes, alcohol and seductive woman probably make it too mature for modern kids; the 80's were different. Whoever is responsible for Disney & Warner working together to make this should win a Nobel award. Christopher Lloyd hasn't aged a day over 65.Everyone should see 'Who Framed Roger Rabbit' at least once in their life. It's a classic.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Dazzling Special Effects in Toon Town,"A dazzling mixture of live action and animation is this film's selling point, but it helps that it's anchored by a smart script that tips its hat to the detective noirs of the 1940s and by good performances from both its human actors (Bob Hoskins and Christopher Lloyd) and its voice performers (Kathleen Turner is especially memorable as Jessica Rabbitt, perhaps the sexiest cartoon woman in history).Computer animation has made special effects passé, but at the time of this movie's release, its effects were state of the art, making Disney's previous efforts to blend live action and animation (like ""Mary Poppins"") look hopelessly antiquated.You'll have a blast spotting the cartoon celebrity cameos. It's like a Merrie Melodies version of ""Around the World in 80 Days.""Grade: A",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Such an impressive film.,"Who Framed Roger Rabbit really is a movie that seems to get better as the years go on, as well as being one I enjoy more and more each time I revisit it. It's a loving homage to film noir that also works as a gentle parody of the genre while also having tons of over-the-top slapstick humor and various visual/verbal jokes, feeling borderline overwhelming at times because of how much it tries to do.Sometimes, I just want to lean forward and admire all the technical qualities of blending live-action with animation, yet sometimes, I just want to sit back and enjoy the fast-paced story, interesting narrative turns, and almost non-stop humor/action.It works on so many levels, and how it all came together like this, I'll never know. Not only that, but it technically holds up extremely well, with so much cinematic wizardry done to make everything seamless. If the script and humor wasn't up to snuff, it would still be worth watching for its technical strengths. Yet if all the visuals didn't hold up and nothing felt convincing, it would still be worth watching for the witty screenplay.Also, either way, what you also have here is an amazingly dedicated performance from Bob Hoskins. This is one of those performances that lays bare how the Academy Awards don't truly value comedic performances. The fact you believe he's interacting with cartoon characters (and, briefly, an entire cartoon world) shows he was wholly dedicated to the role, he nails his simple yet believable character arc, and he's really funny in a more subtle way than the overly expressive cartoon elements (which are all still funny in their own way).There are a few nitpicks - one scene transition felt really awkward (the one that starts with a weirdly janky silhouette of Jessica Rabbit in Eddie's office), but almost all the humor works and I always have a good time throughout while watching this. It's a technical marvel and a fun film all at once, and quite likely the high point of Robert Zemeckis' entire body of work.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
"It's the story of a man, a woman, and a rabbit in a triangle of trouble.","Who Framed Roger Rabbit mixes the world of animation and live action effortlessly, what makes it even more respectable is how well it holds up compared to recent flicks like Looney Tunes: Back in Action.Zemeckis pushes the envelope and continues to today, or at least tries to. His films seem to lack the heart and soul of his earlier works. With Who Framed Roger Rabbit, Zemeckis blends old school film noir detective stories with a looney stylized world in which the character live.Bob Hoskins is the alcoholic detective who must solve the case of....who framed roger rabbit. He does a wonderful job in the role and acts opposite an imaginary character with ease. Roger Rabbit himself is a zany character that is in love with Jessica Rabbit, a busty bombshell of a character with flowing red hair. She is of course the femme fatale. What's a film without a villain? Christopher Lloyd as Judge Doom is creepy and effective. Without a doubt he will give chills to your bones. His distaste for toons is about as villainous as you can get.Their are numerous winks and nods to old school cartoon characters. What other film can you see Daffy and Donald duck battle each other? The toon world is a great way to show creativity and the crew make sure they use their opportunity to do so. This film is great for both kids and adults and is to this day, a classic.I highly recommend Who Framed Roger Rabbit to anyone looking for a good story, interesting characters and great entertainment.

An all-time instant classic!,"So I just got done watching Who Framed Roger Rabbit (1988) for the first time ever and this is easily one of the best comedy movies I've ever seen in my life.Positives for Who Framed Roger Rabbit (1988):
This movie is a phenomenal combination of live-action and animation together. The fact that we have a movie this innovative is truly astounding to me and needs to be applauded. This movie also has some of the best comedy I've ever seen in any movie. I really enjoyed the human characters in this movie especially Bob Hoskins as Eddie Valiant, Christopher Lloyd as Judge Doom and Joanna Cassidy as Dolores. Bob Hoskins does a fantastic job at making Eddie Valiant captivating and funny at the same time. It was a lot of fun to see Christopher Lloyd go from someone as ecentric as Doc Brown in Back to the Future (1985) to someone as cartoonishly evil as Judge Doom and he was having the time of his life as this character. Then you have the toon chatacters in this movie and I like dall of them. Roger Rabbit is one of the funniest and good-natured animated characters I've ever seen in any movie and that is only elevated by Charlie Fleischer voice performance in this movie. I also liked Kathleen Turner as Jessica Rabbit in this movie and her dynamic with Roger was very good. It was an absolute delight to see both the Disney Animated and Looney Tunes Characters in the same movie together.Overall, Who Framed Roger Rabbit (1988) is an absolute comedy classif for the ages and I highly recommend this movie to anyone who is a fan of great comedy and animation.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
A great movie that will appeal to kids and adults alike.,"Who Framed Roger Rabbit is a movie that was truly ahead of it's time. The mixture the of live action and animation works so well. Bob Hoskins is great as Eddie Valiant, a bitter, drunken detective hired by R. K. Maroon to get some candid photos of his competition Marvin Acme with Roger's wife.After the star sees the photos, Mr. Acme is murdered, making Roger the number one suspect. Judge Doom hates toons, he wants to catch Roger and ""dip"" him. Roger turns to Eddie Valiant to help him prove his innocence. Eddie has no love for toons anymore. His brother was killed by one. Regardless, Eddie reluctantly helps Roger.Who Framed Roger Rabbit is a visual treat that both children and adults can enjoy. There's many classic cartoon characters featured in the film. The story is well paced and keeps you entertained. I enjoyed this film as a child and I find that it still holds up well.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Americian Cinematic classic,Who Framed Roger Rabbit is one of the great films that I recall from childhood. Robert Zemeicks made a film that everyone can enjoy. Watching the film as an adult I noticed there's big a amount of underlined sexual humor in this film the kind of humor that you have to be an adult to get. Bob Hoskins and Christopher Lloyd were in top form as the hero and villain in the film and we all know that the two best voice overs in the film were Charles Fleischer and Kathleen Turner. I like the fact that both Diseny and Warner Bros characters both make appearances in the film. This is still one of favorite Zemekicks films so sit back and watch this for old times-sake.,8.0,Anonymous,Animation

Who Framed Roger Rabbit impresses with the technical component for the late 80s,"Who Framed Roger Rabbit impresses with the technical component for the late 80s. Who Framed Roger Rabbit is one of the first films from a specific genre of animated feature films. For the late 80s, not everyone could shoot this, and Robert Zemeckis, who was at the peak of popularity, also directed. Who Framed Roger Rabbit is both comedy and detective and even partly noir. In this film, everyone will find something they are interested in. The plot of this children's film, everything is banal and simple, there is no intrigue that is inherent in neo-noir films. Who Framed Roger Rabbit is definitely worth watching for children, the film can be an excellent example for acquaintance with adult cinema, I advise everyone to watch.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
An 80's Classic & Robert Zemeckis' Best,"No doubt, this movie is a classic. Honestly, who hasn't seen this movie? As I see it, this film ranks up there with GHOST BUSTERS, BACK TO THE FUTURE, and the INDIANA JONES (original) trilogy as one of the most memorable films of the '80s. It's entertaining for both kids and adults, equal parts loony and suspenseful. Based on a mystery novel by Gary K. Wolf (which I'm now reminded I really want to read), the film is set in a world where cartoons and real life coexists side-by-side, also known as every kid's dream. Cartoon characters inhabit a colorful world known as Toontown that somehow exists next to Los Angeles (awfully convenient, really). The movie is a wacky adventure mixed with film noir set in the late 1940s. Private detective Eddie Valiant is hired to trail the wife of famed cartoon star Roger Rabbit and prove that she's having an affair with cartoon gadget mogul Marvin Acme. Roger doesn't respond to the news well and, when Marvin Acme turns up dead, Roger's the number one suspect. Roger pleads with Valiant, a toon-hater since the day one dropped a piano on his brother's head, to help clear his name and protect him from the brooding Judge Doom. Doom has developed a chemical mixture known as ""dip"" and it's the only real means of killing a toon, which he appears to do with great pleasure. Valiant is the one man who can clear Roger's name, find Acme's true killer, and unravel a conspiracy that may result in the end of Toontown.If you've somehow gone this long without seeing this movie, there's something wrong with you and you need to remedy it as soon as possible. It doesn't matter how old a person is, there's something here for everyone. For example, it's the only time we've been able to see the world's most beloved cartoon characters from all major studios come together in the same film: Mickey Mouse skydiving with Bugs Bunny, Donald and Daffy Duck in a piano battle, etc. It's enough to blow a kid's mind and nostalgic enough that anyone who grew up on these cartoons will get a kick out of it. That's not to say the movie is all cartoon zaniness. I'll be honest and I'm sure I'm not the only one who can say that Judge Doom scared the ever-loving crap out of me when I was younger. Christopher Lloyd is down-right creepy as the film's antagonist, dressed all in black with an evil deliberate feel to every move he makes. The scene in the Acme Warehouse where he demonstrates the effectiveness of his dip on a cartoon shoe is pretty messed up when you think about it. He dips the shoe into the toxic mixture and when he pulls his gloved hand out of the barrel, it's covered in goopy red ink/paint to really drive home the point that he just killed the toon. And don't get me started on the final act where Valiant confronts the villain. I'll spare excessive details for the uninitiated, but I was four-years-old when the movie came and I still remember how terrified I was. I'm just saying.The characters in this movie have become iconic: Roger Rabbit, Baby Herman, and especially Jessica Rabbit (who's been widely recognized as the hottest cartoon creation ever, no doubt due in part to Kathleen Turner's vocal performance). They may never be as widely beloved as the classic characters (Mickey, Bugs, etc.) but they left their mark on my childhood just the same. Judge Doom is a crazy S.O.B. and ranks as one of my all-time favorite movie villains, and Bob Hoskins is a great sport for all the craziness as Eddie Valiant. The story is complex enough for an adult audience with some older humor sprinkled in for the ""grown-ups"" to get a laugh and the kids get a zany ride in a world where cartoons are real. No offense to BACK TO THE FUTURE and it's massive fan base (of which I'm a part), but I think this film is Robert Zemeckis' best.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Who Framed Roger Rabbit,"I didnt realize at a young age how fun this film is. It's a classic film noir, which I never realized until now. The film was made in 1988 but took place in the 1940s. Typical film noir of the 40s, the main character is a extremely committed and sharp detective, but burned out and a alcoholic. Being tossed to the side and under utilized by the force. We have all seen this topic a million times. But this film is still a fun ride. If you are not careful, you may mistake this for a kids film, vit then you will soon realize after about 10 minutes that it is not. I would recommend this film if you like a good detective film or a good comedy.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
A classic film noir with animation,"Modern audiences might not understand how groundbreaking this film actually was. That's because the combination of live action and animation kind of looks off to our eyes that are accustomed to computer generated animation. But it was revolutionary at the time and single-handed ushered in a new era of success for Disney. While the character of Roger the Rabbit is certainly annoying, the film holds up as a weird experimental film noir. Jessica rabbit's line I'm not bad, I was just drawn that way is a classic. And there are some classic moments of terror. It does a very good job of allowing the audience to suspend their disbelief. If you have never watched this film before, and you like animation, or you like film noir, this is a really delightful combination of the two.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Amazing combination of 2D animation and reality filming,"This one is easily the best out of those kinds of movies out there that I know of (the only other one being Space Jam). Well directed, a great cast of people animated and real, a good overall look/attitude that doesn't feel much like a childish ""cartoon"", and an in-depth and complex story for a film about a rabbit from Toon Town. Disney and Looney Toon fans rejoice, as this is what I would consider a one hit wonder that happens to also include Spielberg in the making. The drawn out characters in real life settings were expertly done especially with the lighting and the shadowing. When it comes to putting animated characters in a real life world and vise versa in an interesting and engaging story, Who Framed Roger Rabbit is a gold mine of that type of genre such that it exists. I'm actually quite surprised that there isn't really any other movie like this one aside from Space Jam. This flick shall remain a rather large classic for 2D animation fans and for the people who just love animation in general in just about any time zone (like myself). There's nothing non-eye-catching about it for the most part.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Made in the nick of time...,"Who Framed Roger Rabbit directed by Robert Zemekis is a film that as each year passes becomes more important. Made when so many of the originators of the animated short were still around to contribute and scrutinize the final product. The pre-CGI special effects are a total romp and just another analog aspect of this stunning achievement. So, as well as being a brilliant homage to the glory of full animation it is also a social commentary on the corporate automotive agenda that still plagues us today, poor mass transit and terrible consumer options. A reveal, if one wants to know who Judge Doom really was you have to watch The Adventures of Ichabod and Mr. Toad. Just shake the weasels... Mr Winkie.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
As Crazy As A March Hare,"I love this move. It's crazy and enjoyable and a virtual cavalcade of cartoon stars from Betty Boop to Bugs Bunny even if it neglects the existence of TV Toons like Scooby Doo. The recent live action cartton such as Space Jam and the others just don't have the spirit of Roger Rabbit. The plot involves Eddie Valiant, played by the excellant Bob Hoskins, a detective who hates toons, who once more has to enter their world as he gets involved in a murder investigation involving Jessica Rabbit, the most oversexed cartoon ever born under ink and paint. Christopher Lloyd plays the psycho judge who wants to destroy Toon Town. The plot, however, plays second fiddle to the effects, which by now are a bit dated under the computer magic of today's movies. Hopefully, the promised sequel will be all it can be. I also hope that if Warner Brothers and Disney can get together to show their big toon stars together than it will inspire Marvel and DC Comics to put their best heroes together in a live action extravaganza.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
It's one of my favourite 1980s films of all time and it's one of the best 1980s films of all time as well.,I've watched this 1988 Disney/Touchstone fantasy comedy film many times and it's absolutely fantastic.

A madcap cartoon mystery for young and old alike,"In Robert Zemeckis' ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"" the titular rabbit (voiced by Charles Fleischer) goes on the run from the law after being framed for a crime he didn't commit. With the help of private dick Eddie Valiant (Bob Hoskins) he sets out to clear his name and get to the bottom of the murderous plot.The acting is better than you would normally expect for what is ostensibly a kids' movie. Bob Hoskins, despite his British origins, fits seamlessly into the role of a seedy private eye. Christopher Lloyd deserves special mention as the menacing Judge Doom. The voice talent for the animated characters is top-notch, with Charles Fleischer imbuing Roger with plenty of personality and Kathleen Turner lending her unmistakable voice to the femme fatale Jessica. Of course, there's also the legendary Mel Blanc and others voicing the established characters who appear in cameo roles.The story is an interesting one though I'm doubtful of how many children will be able to follow a story that has stylistic similarities to ""Chinatown"". The script also has plenty of double entendres that I'm sure flew well over my head when I saw this as a kid close to twenty years ago. These elements make the story appeal to adults while kids will no doubt enjoy the shenanigans of the animated characters.Zemeckis' direction is well handled as usual though I can't help but wish that the film had been helmed by executive producer Steven Spielberg instead. Nevertheless, Zemeckis and the Richard Williams-led animators do a fine job of blending the live and animated action, all without the benefit of CGI. The film is still impressive today and deserved all of the accolades that it garnered on the basis of its technical merit.This is a film that should appeal to both the young and the young at heart, especially those who grew up watching the likes of Bugs Bunny, Mickey Mouse and others. It is nothing short of a celebration of animation, produced by talented professionals with passion and reverence.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Something of the past.,"How could you even classify a movie like this in modern times anymore, it's obviously a kids movie. But the adult themes within, especially like how Jessica is portrayed and the alcoholism are something you don't expect to see these days anymore. That said, I'm not watching it as a kid so I can appreciate the humor in it.Technically, this is a STUNNING movie, every scene with the toons will have you questioning how they did it. The animation is top notch, it is exceptionally smooth. We get the whole scala of toons to see, Mickey mouse, Bugs Bunny, you name it. Mostly consist of very short segments, with Roger and Jessica taking the main show. There's also a bunch of mentions and shots taken at the current state of the industry back then, and the world (Judge Doom's monologue).Music is pretty good overall but not as memorable as I'd hoped except for the last song which is great. There were very little sentimental segments, stuff to pull at the heart strings, which kept the movie lighthearted but imo it could've used more drama.Pacing wise it starts somewhat slow, picks up nicely, but the final warehouse showdown overstays it's welcome a bit too much and felt somewhat slow at times to me. Plot is very simple, murder mystery but it's yelling in your face who the killer is. Though the final twist I didn't see coming, though it didn't change much.Absolutely filled with slapstick humor, like the cartoons, done really well. Though to me, not something that makes me laugh anymore. Just a couple dialog lines made me laugh a bit.Generally though, just for the combination of animation and real world interaction / action it's a must watch. By this point it's a classic.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

Iconic For a Reason,"It's a different kind of movie. Very different. But also unique. The movie succeeded beyond succeeding in merging normal film with 2d cartoon with next to no seams.

We follow a detective as he tries to get to the bottom of it. The best part of the entire movie is how they brought Disney and Warner brother cartoon characters together in one movie. It's really fascinating that they make it seem like there really are cartoon people out there just acting on camera. It's a really fun concept.

AMAZING!,"For the very first time, I watched the most widely lauded live-action/animated movie in existence, Who Framed Roger Rabbit, with my mom tonight. And it truly is everything it's cracked up to be!Set in Los Angeles in 1947, in a world where cartoons meet reality, this movie centers on two very opposite characters with a believable dynamic: surly, down-on-his-luck detective Eddie Valiant (played by Bob Hoskins) and famous cartoon star Roger Rabbit (voiced by Charles Fleischer). Eddie is hired by Roger's boss, cartoon producer R. K. Maroon (Alan Tilvern) to investigate an adultery scandal involving Roger's sultry toon human wife Jessica Rabbit (speaking voice by an uncredited Kathleen Turner, singing voice by Amy Irving). However, when Marvin Acme (Stubby Kaye), the owner of Toontown and Jessica's alleged paramour, is found murdered, Roger is framed for the murder, and the evil Judge Doom (Christopher Lloyd) vows to catch and destroy him.The acting is flawless in this movie! But Bob Hoskins, may he rest in peace, really stands out as Eddie. Truth be told, this is actually only the fourth movie I've seen him in, after Balto, Hook and Garfield: A Tale of Two Kitties, and this may actually have been the best performance he ever gave. Not only does he pull off such a convincing American detective, but I really liked how he developed from a surly, humorless alcoholic to a loveable, goofy guy thanks to Roger, and his interactions and chemistry with Roger are so believable and realistic. It's great, too, because during filming, Bob Hoskins was just acting with empty space, while Charles Fleischer stood off-camera in a Roger Rabbit costume, reciting his lines. Speaking of which, Charles Fleischer gives a truly hilarious voice to Roger. He's perfectly cast, too, because a stand-up comedian and a toon aren't very different. Kathleen Turner is fittingly seductive as Jessica. Come on, give her credit! And Christopher Lloyd makes a PERFECT villain as Judge Doom. He's so scary, yet so entertaining!Okay, let's talk about the animation! Animation legend Richard Williams directed the animation for this movie, and his crew were given the task of animating to the live-action footage, frame-by-frame. Since director Robert Zemeckis kept the camera moving all the time, it was very difficult for the crew to keep the models consistent. But they pulled it off!!!! The animated characters and objects interact so well with the live-action ones. Truly the best blend of hand-drawn animation and live-action I've seen in my life. What's equally astounding is that ILM optically composited the two and animated separate light sources... WITHOUT USING ONE COMPUTER! Now THAT is achievement!The writing is great, too! Along with an original and touching story, the humor in this movie manages to appeal to kids on one level, and adults on another. The pacing may not be the best, but for what is this? Also, this movie does something truly amazing that no movie or show has done before or since: Mickey Mouse and Bugs Bunny share the screen and interact with each other! If that's not awesome, I don't know what is!Music, music, music. Genius composer Alan Silvestri, as always, delivered a truly incredible score for this movie. It ranges everywhere from epic, to jazzy, to tender, to humorous; especially his use of the Looney Tunes theme, ""The Merry-Go-Round Broke Down""! And of course, let's not forget the song ""Smile, Darn Ya, Smile!"" from the 1931 short of the same name.When all's said and done, Who Framed Roger Rabbit is an innovation in and of itself. It's an amazing live-action/animated movie with all the loveable cartoon characters you can think of, and an exciting story to go along with it, and as such, is a rare masterpiece that you'll never see being made in today's world! If you still haven't seen this movie, I highly suggest watching it!!!",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Great family film.,"""Who Framed Roger Rabbit?""A review by Craig Barron.In ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit?"", a 1988 film by Robert Zemeckis (Forrest Gump, Castaway,the Back to the Future trilogy) Zemeckis masterfully combines animation and live action in one ofthe most technically challenging and innovative films ever made. It the not the first film to mixlive action and animation together but it is hands down the the one that does it best. It succeeds,however because the filmmakers don't show off their technical expertise we also get a verywitty and sharp satire that affectionately parodies the film noir genre as well as the detectivedramas of the 1940s.Bob Hoskins as the detective, Eddie Valiant, gives a flawless performance one of his best.And Christopher LLoyd creates one of the most memorable screen villains of all time as themenacing Judge Doom. The big reveal about his true identity (which I won't spoil here) isdelightful and given the identity of the actor playing the role a natural one as well.My main complaint about the film, ironically enough is the actor who provides the voice ofRoger comedian Charles Fleischer. I found the voice the be somewhat annoying and grating.This however is a minor quibble as this is one Zemeckis's best films and one of Disney's bestZemeckis has always been an innovator in the use of special effects in his films and this one isdifferent.

Excellent Spielberg/Zemeckis Production besides Back to the Future,"Who Framed Roger Rabbit/1988/****Main Stars: Bob Hoskins Charles Fleischer Christopher Lloyd Joanna Cassidy Stubby Kaye Alan TilvernOkay, I know I've seen this movie thousands of times. It's just I've never had a chance to review it so don't wonder that I've never seen this or the classic Jaws just now! Especially not Jaws that I have seen countless times. Now this is a wonderful most original film yet it could have been extended. Anyone knows that yet it is still the enchanted, original, ultra loud, excellent film brought to you by the people that brought to you Back to the Future: Robert Zemeckis and Steven Spielberg among others! So, where do the filmmakers get the title? Well, Roger Rabbit (Charles Fleischer) was framed for killing the famous Marvin Acme (Stubby Kaye). But since he was ""framed"", who really did the killing? Well there's one person so sinister, so dark, and so evil, it's not even funny. Who, WHO could possibly be that person? Well, you'll find out the answers even though it's pretty obvious. Who's the most evil character that tries to kill the valiant Eddie Valiant (Bob Hoskins)? Who's the evil immoral jerk that killed Eddie's brother (""D-dropped a piano on his head!"")? Who tried to kill Eddie himself by trying to kill him with a razor sharp yellow cartoon wheel that spins round and round to slice him in half? Who's the ""inhuman"" toon that has bulging eyes? All those answers are revealed in the movie for you. Because the movie is so great but too short, it has bunches and bunches of things you need to follow that are actually surprisingly ""fun"" to follow! The movie opens with a scene from a cartoon starring Roger Rabbit himself. Roger has to save the baby that's stuck on the counter who could careless about Roger. He just wants to get to the jar of cookies at the top of the refrigerator and then Roger gets injured a lot in that. So at the end of the cartoon, Roger gets smashed in the head carelessly, and sees tweedy birds around his head instead of stars that he was supposed to see. So the director starts yelling at him. Surprisingly the innocent baby in the cartoon even started yelling at him in an annoying raspy middle-aged fat man's voice. So Roger starts hitting his head trying to prove to the director that he can see stars instead of chirping tweedy birds around his head. Then it focuses in on Eddie who then says in a typical-annoyed-basically-stating-that-all-toons-are-that-way voice, ""Toons"". Anywaaazz, how would Roger try to keep secret and hide by neither keeping secret nor hiding? By hiding in a bar owned by Valiant's ""friend"" Dolores (Joanna Cassidy). He would have to make sure not to cause too much attraction unless he wants to be submerged face down into Judge Doom's (Christopher Lloyd's) THE DIP! So Valiant keeps him with Dolores in a bar that shakes every time a trolley goes by causing the lights to shake and almost hit someone in the head. Yet Roger is a TOON and can't keep secret at all. He ""has to make people laugh!"" So he sings to them and uses a record as background music. When the record gets stuck in one spot and does the same note over and over and over again, Roger will also do the same thing over and over and over again using plates to crash on his head (do-do, CRASH, do-do, CRASH, do-do, CRASH, do-do, CRASH)! So Eddie picks him up from the bar knocking over the remaining plates and lets them shatter and throws him in to a dark room to shut him up. That's where he needs to hide but not for long In the movie there's the will of Marvin Acme involved in the external conflict and the body and soul of R.K. Maroon (Alan Tilvern), owner of Maroon Cartoons. But then Cloverleaf butts in and la-di-da and if you haven't seen the film, I suggest you do since it's a classic and will remain one. Toon Town, Maroon Cartoons, Acme Cartoons, the whole story of Judge Doom and the freeway needing to be built, THE DIP, the characters themselves and the names of them are rather clever, the whole deal/package! What a wonderful, excellent film! Movie directed by Robert Zemeckis.",,Anonymous,Animation
Looney & Disney,"""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"" is an Entertaining movie. My favorite parts are the parts with ""Daffy Duck"" and ""Donald Duck"" having a war, and ""Bugs Bunny"" with ""Mickey Mouse"". If they make another ""Roger Rabbit"" movie, I hope they make more ""Looney Tunes"" and ""Disney"" characters team up.",,Anonymous,Animation
Very funny,"WFRR is a very funny film, cleverly mixing live action with cartoon animation.Unfortunately though, time has not been that kind on the animation - its looking dated and not very detailed, with not very accurate lip-syncing.The live action parts are great though - Bob Hoskins is great, being able to create a straight face all the way though.Christopher Lloyd is also great as the mad baddie.Over all, a great film that could do with being re-made, with CGI animation (which is the way forward).",,Anonymous,Animation
Wacky but good,"When I was about to see this movie, I kept thinking 'Who the hell is Roger Rabbit?' But after a few minutes, it was very clear to me that he's a wacky cartoon. Now I like Bugs Bunny, but Roger is much better! OK, let's discuss the movie, shall we?Bob Hoskins did a fine job as Eddie Valiant, and a big congrats to the people who took care of the special effects. I didn't know this movie was from '88 until I saw the site here on the IMDb. Right, I love the mix of cartoons and 'real' movie. Well, guess I have to  admit it was so wacky but yet so good. If only more movies like these ones were made...!",,Anonymous,Animation
Cartoons meet real life,"The set in the movie is 1940's.The humans and the cartoon characters are living happily together in the same world. Bob Hoskins plays the private detective Eddie Valiant.He has to help the cartoon character Roger Rabbit because Roger thinks his wife Jessica Rabbit is cheating on him.Eddie's not so happy to help Roger, because a cartoon character murdered his brother. Then Roger gets more problems when he is blamed on a murder he didn't do.Who framed Roger Rabbit? is the big question now. Christopher Lloyd plays the evil Judge Doom.There are lots of classic cartoon characters in the movie.You can see characters like Mickey and Minnie Mouse, Donald Duck, Daffy Duck, Bugs Bunny and lots of others great characters in the movie.They never made a sequel for the movie which people were waiting for.Who Framed Roger Rabbit is a very entertaining movie from Robert Zemeckis, which offers something for everyone.Something for kids and something for adults. That's all, folks!",,Anonymous,Animation
Roger rules.,"This is really a classic detective-story with all the classic elements and characters, BUT...Toons are involved...lots of toons. Its very funny to see toons from all the studios (Warner Bros, Disney etc.) on screen at the same time. The movie is set in a 1947 Hollywood where toons are moviestars and live life thereafter.Bob Hoskins is great as the drunken detective Eddie Valiant and Christopher Lloyd performs suprisingly well as the psychotic Judge Doom.Perfect setting, great cast, wonderful effects, details and script. I very much like this movie. Overall, a film experience unlike any other.",,Anonymous,Animation
The toons and the live actors united,"I love this movie. I think I first saw it when I was about 9 years old.  I thought this was a wonderful form of live action and animation. I have seen a lot of films with live action and animation such as ""Mary Poppins"" and ""Bedknobs and Broomsticks"" and not to mention Disney's very first series of the early 20's, the ""Alice Comedies"" in which a little girl is in a cartoon world.  But this is a modernized form of it in which they probably used computers.  But enough about the animation!  I thought Bob Hoskins was wonderful as the boozehound Eddie Valient who was hired by cartoon producer R.K. Maroon to solve a mystery.  The title character, Roger was hilarious. And let's not forget Baby Herman (he's a baby, but has a grown man's voice). We also have the different cartoon stars like Yosemite Sam, Mickey Mouse, and Betty Boop (who was jeleous of Roger's wife Jessica because she was in color).  I liked the scene with Donald and Daffy Duck playing the pianos. It was so funny.  This is a must see film for everyone, but some scens may give small children nightmares like seeing the evil Judge Doom.",,Anonymous,Animation
I can not think of a better movie.,"I saw this when I was very young and my parents thought it would be a kid's movie. Well, yes, and no. I can say that it was a very original and incredible way of telling a story, blending the world of cartoons into the world of humans (from what I remember of it. I was very young). Robert Zemeckis is now one of my favourite directors. I have since then become a movie buff, as you can tell, and this was probably what started my obsession with telling stories. I already liked cartoons, but the fact that this consisted of both cartoon and real-life worlds put my faith back in the real world. If I get the opportunity to see this one again, I wouldn't just watch it, I would keep it!",,Anonymous,Animation
"Really Spectacular, watch it again and look more closely","Naturally, this works as a great kids movie that can also be enjoyed by adults.  The cartoon effects work really well.On another level, this is a satire about racism.  The Toons in this movie are the same as the jews, the blacks, or any group that has been persecuted at some point.  They have their own little ghetto in Toon Town.  The villians of this movie are the humans who want to do some ethnic cleansing. There's some ironic twists in the story that notably reflect the Nazi movement in Germany, but could be applied to any form of racism.  Really a great and funny film that gets less credit than it deserves.",,Anonymous,Animation
12 years later it's still cool,"This movie is absolute perfection.  Laugh if you must, but it manages to come up with a great premise, and pulls it off it flawlessly.  The special effects are still impressive today, and the campy, hammed up performances are all perfect for the over the top satire of film noir and corporate greed.  Is it the best movie ever?  Hell no.  But it does what it sets out to do and that alone is a great feat.  And any film with Micky Mouse and Bugs Bunny in the same scene deserves a hallowed place in film history.",,Anonymous,Animation
A cult classic that involves the human world and toon town but still no one would be ashamed of seeing it,"Some say this is a family movie but it's slightly bit dark to be a family movie. Since some parts maybe a bit too dark for some kids. Although if I saw this movie as a kid, I would have enjoyed every second of it, but it's a movie that leans slightly bit more for the adult audiences in my opinion. Because of the dark tone of it all, even if it involves cartoon characters. What this movie is, is a mix of the real world with noir style and the cartoon world going for it. Basically in this story real people and cartoons interact with each other and the cartoons job is basically the entertain the people which they seem to enjoy doing. When it comes to the plot it isn't anything great. But what really stands out about this movie is how the humans and cartoons interact with each other and the environment. The noir style and the acting is a bit childish but it fits most of the scenarios which also includes a place called toon town. Also Roger Rabbit can be annoying sometimes since most scenes takes place in the human world, but some of his morals saves him from being a entirely annoying and dislikable character. The grumpy detective starts out not likable as well but as the movie progresses that somewhat changes. The mix of human world and cartoon land is what made this movie work since it did a good job of it. It might seem slightly dated now but I would have been blown away if I saw it in 1988. Still a good movie, that lacks in the plot but makes up for it with other elements.6.8/10",,Anonymous,Animation
A subjective objection,"By any kind of objective standards, this is a great movie.  It takes the live action/ animation combination to a new level, and does so with genuine hard work, rather than clever trickery.In the first place, the animation was done by cartoonists who drew each frame by hand, just like in the old days.  Furthermore, they worked without the benefit of the artificial restraints that are customarily placed on live-action footage to make the combination easier (for example, no camera movement of any kind in any shot that's going to include animated figures).And there was hard work on the part of the actors too, all of whom were trained in mime, so that they could create a convincing illusion of picking up and throwing around cartoon object and animals that had some weight to them.  The actors also took great pains with such matters as maintaining convincing eye contact with the animated characters, and being sure never to forget they were in the scene.Furthermore, the movie had a fully-developed plot and three-dimensional characters. (Well, you know what I mean.)  It would have been very easy to get caught up in technique and forget all the other elements that make a movie complete.Alas, however, speaking from a purely subjective viewpoint, I didn't like this movie.  Why?  Because cartoons were a happy part of my childhood, and I hated to see these cartoon characters stripped of their innocence.Let me qualify this, however, by saying that it wouldn't have bothered me in a movie that was supposed to be disturbing. For example, I found the twisted cartoon images in the `It's a Good Life' sequence from THE TWILIGHT ZONE MOVIE quite effective.  But when this corruption is used as a vehicle for comedy, it leaves me feeling like somebody dumped mud all over something I hold dear.",,Anonymous,Animation
Extremely fun and clever,"So I am now 18 years old and I was able to catch this film on Cartoon Network. I had definitely heard of it, but this was my first time seeing it. It was pretty much what I expected. A very fun, clever animated noir film that reminds you of everything Hollywood and the entertainment business is about. It's an extremely wonderful and entertaining film with clever sequences all around. It reminds me of my childhood filled with 2- D animated characters. I love how its also a mystery crime film, and in that aspect it got the period quite well. I feel as if here I am decades after it became an iconic film talking about it and that I was late, but it really is just a joy to watch. Story-telling at its best and most ambitious.",,Anonymous,Animation
Simply Outstanding,"Real actors and animation have been placed together before, but never in such a vivid and entertaining way.  This movie is just a great experience; it's one of my most favorite movies.  The opening cartoon is simply hilarious, and it just gets better throughout the film.  Bob Hoskins gives a good performance as detective Eddie Valiant.  By the way, those Pacific Electric ""trolleys"" are really buses.",,Anonymous,Animation
