"Smart, funny spoof that is impossible not to like!","""Men in Black"" and ""Galaxy Quest"" are in my mind the best sci-fi comedies ever made, because they are both hilarious parodies of two different cultures. Whereas the latter spoofed obsessed fans who take sci-fi entertainment WAY too seriously, this one spoofs the paranoid, tin-foil-hat brand of conspiracy theorists. It has funny characters, witty lines, and does not at all take itself seriously.There are a lot of small details that can take multiple viewings to catch. One thing I found funnier the second time I watched it is the scene where Will Smith has just been severely lectured by his boss in the interrogation room when Tommy Lee Jones enters, asks a few questions, and tells Smith to come with him. Smith: ""I can't, there's still a lot of paperwork to fill out."" Jones: ""No, the paperwork is all taken care of."" Smith's boss (walking by): ""Hey, nice work, Edwards!"" This is one of many quick, funny scenes that you only really get if you're paying attention.All the actors do a good job, too. I thought Rip Torn was the funniest character, and Edgar the bug was hilariously gross. Linda Fiorentino was one of the coolest female characters ever. She put Ripley to shame. Every time I watch this, I want to marry her.Overall, it's a great comedy that is clever and fun all the way through. 8/10 stars.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy"
"Funny, effects laden sci-fi comedy","Agents Jay (Will Smith) and Kay (Tommy Lee Jones) protect our world, that is crammed full of aliens who live among us, and most of them are respectful citizens of planet Earth, but every race can have a bad apple or two. Smith and Jones make an unlikely pair, but they work in harmony really well here, and it's a pretty funny adventure.Fine special effects help to bring the aliens in MIB to life, and they have as much character as the duo in black, and they get just as many laughs. The film carries a good plot and is entertaining from the opening scene; which sets the tone of the film nicely, and makes you yearn for some more.8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy"
One of the best sci-fi comedies ever made.,"As my one line summary says, this is one of the best sci-fi comedies ever made, next to the classic Ghostbusters and the highly underrated Evolution. This movie has action, comedy, and some of the best special effects in the last ten years. Rick Baker, Hollywood's resident 'creature man', as I like to call him, has made such a wide variety of aliens. There's the first alien we see, Mikey; there's the Worm Guys; and the villanous Bug. But there are many others, such as Frank the Pug and the twins. The squid baby is pretty neat. Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith have an undeniable chemistry together, which repeats itself in the sequel. Linda Fiorentino is also good as the leading lady, and veteran actor Rip Torn is gruff as the head of MIB, Zed. Vincent D'Onofrio is also pretty good. My favorite line: ""No, ma'am. We at the FBI do not have a sense of humor that we are aware of."" All in all, two thumbs up, baby!",,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy"
"Fun, memorable sci-fi comedy has lots of personality thanks to director, composer, and two lead actors.","Agent K (Jones)'s partner retires, so he has to find a new one. Street cop Will Smith seems an unlikely contender to join this very special service and help K battle illegal aliens.Barry Sonnenfeld's experience as a cinematographer put him in good stead for planning this quirky fun sci-fi comedy.Men in Black is given life by Sonnenfeld's shot-choices, for greatest comic effect, terrific fun musical score by Danny Elfman, and two perfectly cast actors: Tommy Lee Jones' wry delivery and Will Smith's comic persona make for a movie with some real personality.Vincent D'Onofrio is a memorable bad guy - especially when we don't have to look at his regular face.A few death scenes will be too gruesome for kiddies, but once they're a certain age its bound to be one of their favourite movies.

A great fantasy-comedy,"I am very upset that most people take this movie too seriously This movie is just a nice comedy with a very intriguing subject. Most people try to find bug in this movie but i believe that they should just sit back and enjoy the great epic line. Let's be serious do you believe that a galaxy can be carried around a cat's belt or that ""Elivs is not dead he's just gone home"" ? For this reason I believe this is an excellent comedy with a Sf theme. I also appreciate that the acting is very good and the script is very nicely written. I urge people to stop taking the ""noisy cricket"" too serious! This movie is making fun of the people who take this sort of things too seriously.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy"
"""I never seen sugar do that.""","The Men in Black(based on a comic I've never read, spawning a TV series I haven't watched, so I can make no comparisons to either) are an agency that protect Earth from not only what the aliens, some of whom are already here, might do to it, but also the common man's ignorance of this situation. It opens a doorway into a fantastic world(whilst playing it straight since most of these guys are used to this stuff) that would be overwhelming were it not for rookie agent J(Will Smith, who brings both his sass and undeniable charm) posing as a proxy for the audience, asking the questions we want to, and being given the exposition and explanations that we need. He is likable in his naiveté and his efforts to help the people affected by the outer-space stuff, and the odd couple dynamic between him and K(Tommy Lee Jones, awesome and enjoyable as the old grump who's blasé about what they experience) is great, as are the various other character aspects. Linda Fiorentino is perfectly cast as a somewhat cold coroner, and she has a nice, strong female role. As the villain, we have Vincent D'Onofrio giving an unforgettable and unique performance as the large cockroach(!) wearing the skin of farmer Edgar. It's a size or two too small, leading to it/him making some rather inelegant movements and possessing poor motor skills. And don't worry, at the same time, he's seriously scary. He's immensely physically powerful, and he can't *stand* humans. This really gets into perspective, and that the importance of something is not defined by its size. This is primarily a comedy, as well as a fun sci-fi action adventure with some very unexpected situations and outcomes. It's exciting, engaging and a cool universe that we want to see more of, with this being a brief(and well-paced) peek at roughly 90 minutes. There are creatively designed creatures and big, shiny guns. Danny Elfman supplies this with a bombastic and playful score. There is a bit of moderate to strong language and a little violence and gore(little of it involving people, and just about none of that graphic) in this. I recommend this to fans of the stars and the concept. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy"
Funny Sci-Fi.  As Good As Ghostbusters.,"As I stated above, Men In Black is just as good as the sci-fi comedies Ghostbusters I and II. But instead of chasing ghost's we're chasing after rogue aliens.James (Will Smith) is an officer in the NYPD and one of the top officers. After a hard night, James is questioned by his own police force for allegedly killing a suspect who fell off a building. As James insists that the person was acting strangely, Agent K (Tommmy Lee Jones) comes in and takes him out.James is welcomed to a secret agency which keeps aliens in check. After a brief examination of his life, James (now Agent J) joins the agency. On his first day, suddenly K and J are on a mission to stop a massive cockroach from destroying Earth and starting a galactic war.The chemistry between Smith and Jones is hilarious. Smith has some great comedy scenes especially when he is using his new weapon, the Noisy Crickett and him trying to deliver a baby squid type creature. The aliens are smart, their inventive, and their just plain fun when seeing how they identify themselves and hide their identities. The story is funny and will keep you laughing at almost every scene.The presentation of aliens as everyday people trying to live normal lives in Manhattan is a lot more fun than the presentation of murderous aliens (Independence Day). Another great part is that the film isn't overblown with special effects of alien explosions and massive battles. Instead comedy and chemistry keeps this top comedy flowing.Men In Black. Starring: Will Smith, Tommy Lee Jones, Linda Fiorentino, and Rip Torn.4 1/2 out of 5 Stars.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy"
Good plain fun.,"This movie was good fun!It was one of those rare films that allowed you to take your brain out and play with it for a while.  While other films are just plain stupid, this film was charming.  It knew the secret:  if you're suspending believability, then DON'T TAKE YOURSELF TOO SERIOUSLY!!!This film had original and interesting moments that were neither predictable nor rehashed.

Fast moving science fiction comedy.,"This movie was really fun to watch the first time I saw it in theaters, upon subsequent viewings, however, it loses its luster. Still though, it is still a fun movie to watch. Unlike the sequel which rushes us through the story, this one takes a bit more time developing the characters even though it is only about ten minutes longer. Both Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith are very good and funny, especially Smith because he is the new guy so he is seeing all the weird aliens and such for the first time. This is also something missing from the sequel. In the end though the reason I probably like this one so much is that it sort of reminds me of a Ghostbuster movie, and seeing as how we will most likely never see another sequel to that movie it is nice to see a movie sort of like it in that they are keeping tabs and hunting aliens rather than ghosts. The pug dog scene is funny, and the dog is not over used as in the sequel, and there is also a funny scene where Will Smith must deliver an alien baby...their main objective in this one is to track down an alien insect that has hijacked the skin of a guy and is trying to find a universe. If he succeeds the Earth is destroyed, of course Tommy Lee's character is so calm about the whole situation that you feel you have nothing to worry about. So for a funny movie that has great scenes of Will Smith training and becoming a Man in Black watch this film and do yourself a favor and skip part two...not that it was entirely bad, I liked it okay, but it just seems like an unnecessary sequel.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy"
I can see why I liked this so much as a kid.,I mean this is a funny enough movie and it doesn't take itself too seriously.The premise is pretty absurd and the movie pokes fun at everything it is setting up so that is kinda funny. The CGI looks like 90s CGI but still not as bad as George Lucas' films that would come out in the next decade.Though I'm not sure how I feel about the opening metaphor about illegal aliens.It does drop some interesting bits about the hubris of man and how we think about the universe. D'Onofrio and Tommy Lee Jones are good in this too.So overall revisiting this film for the first time in probably 15 years it isn't as bad as I thought it would be. A decent way to waste time.,6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy"
Great concept. Sub-par execution.,"I wanted to rewatch this movie as part of a marathon of classics that I'm going through with my girlfriend and it was one of the first ones she suggested. I didn't remember much of the movie from the last time I've seen it but I knew it was good, or at least that's how I remembered it. So it was to my surprise that I found a ridiculous amount of plot holes, non-existent backstories, and many feeble attempts at creating a coherent and immersive world that would make you feel like it's actually real. It was especially shocking seeing as this movie is regarded as a timeless, iconic, classic, and that's I was left greatly disappointed. For example, Edwards, (or Agent J), had absolutely no back story whatsoever. We never learn about his family or loved ones or frankly anyone who even knew him. I mean the guy was NYPD for god's sakes. So it really felt like lazy writing when we were meant to believe that in order for Edwards to join MIB, he had to completely disappear from the world he once lived in. In addition, the ending felt rushed and the story, (which had the potential to be something special), came up lacking to say the least. But don't get me wrong, the movie had it's bright spots like it's humor and the chemistry between agents ""J"" and ""K"". However, it's really apparent how much potential this movie and it's story had so it's sad to see the final product not meet the expectations. All in all it was a decent watch a pretty good comedy to say the least. Would recommend if you're looking for a quick enjoyable watch.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy"

Will Smith saves the planet again ... this time in a good film!,"After the horribly cheesy ""Independence Day"" of the previous year, it was great to see the actor that saved that movie from being completely unwatchable - Will Smith - get a chance to save the planet in a quality film. From the opening of the film where ""Mikey"", an illegal alien from another planet is disguised as an illegal alien from another country, to the end when we see the earth just as a marble in a pouch of many belonging to an extraterrestrial being, I found this film to be thought provoking, original, and very funny.Tommy Lee Jones (Agent K) and Will Smith (Agent J) are perfect in their roles. Not since Lenny Briscoe and Mike Logan were partners on ""Law and Order"" has the young cop/old cop routine been done so well with such great chemistry and deadpan humor. All of the supporting roles work too. Rip Torn is great as Zed, the head of the secret government organization - the ""Men In Black"" - who are in charge of overseeing the visits of extraterrestrials who have chosen to establish contact with earth and in some cases become semi-permanent residents of this planet. His great one-liners include telling a group of rejected job applicants - who really don't know what kind of job they've applied for - ""Congratulations gentlemen. You are all we've come to expect from years of government training"".Some of the rank and file employees of the agency are aliens themselves. Unmotivated and not particularly loyal, they enjoy hanging out in the break room drinking coffee, smoking heavily, and collecting cheap miniatures of the Statue of Liberty. Vincent D'Onofrio is also outstanding in the dual role of Edgar, a human who gets eaten by a malicious alien cockroach, and also as the cockroach himself as he tools around New York City in his ""brand new Edgar suit"" - Edgar's skin - in an attempt to appear human while trying to start an intergalactic war.Any human who happens to encounter an alien won't remember it thanks to the neuralizer - a device the size of a fountain pen - that the ""Men In Black"" administer to erase any resulting memories. This includes employees of the agency themselves, should they choose to quit or retire. The underlying purpose of all of this covering up makes sense when Smith's character, during his orientation session, tells Tommy Lee Jones that he thinks that people could handle the truth about aliens living among them. Jones' (Agent K's) response is: ""A person is smart. People are dumb, panicky animals and you know it."" This is hard to argue with when you think about the acts that people throughout history have performed as a mob that they would never have done as individuals. I really enjoyed this film, and its smart humor has held up over the years. I think in the future many will wonder, as I still do, why this film didn't get a nod at the Academy Awards other than its award for best makeup, at the very least for the screenplay.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy"
Cosmic rhymes with comic,"The less that we could say is that movies about extra-terrestrials are becoming more and more fashionable. It's certainly the most fertile period for alien movies since the '50s. At the time, these flicks were some kind of Cold War metaphors that promoted anti-communism and McCarthyism and were disguised as tales depicting an invasion from outer-space. Today, it's mainly a very valuable excuse for developing special effects and ultra-sophisticated animatronic creatures. Only, in the case that's picking our interest right now, there's something different.It must be specified beforehand that there are different kinds of alien movies. The first kind is the invasion film which dominated the silver screen in the middle of the twentieth century and which seems gaining in popularity since recent box-office successes like ""Independence Day"". The second kind is the benign alien movie a la ""E.T."" where space invaders are kindly and inoffensive and where humans look like a primitive form of life in the universe.""Men in Black"" belongs to a third type that we don't see much often. We could call it the alien comedy. It's a film genre that is not much approached and which releases even fewer great successes on the box-office side as well as on the critical side. There has been ""Mars Attacks!"", but critics didn't hook to that kind of iconoclast humor from Tim Burton. But with ""MiB"", they will get hooked for sure.""Men in Black"" stars the endlessly serious Tommy Lee Jones and the rising star Will Smith. Jones plays the role of K, a MiB agent, that is an organization which monitors extra-terrestrial activities on Earth. K hires Smith (re-named J) after he successfully pursued an alien in the streets of New York City.Their first mission together consists in recovering a galaxy (because it seems that the size doesn't have any importance) on 'Orion's Belt'. Their adversary is a 'bug disguised' as Edgar (Vincent D'Onofrio) who is also searching for the galaxy. With the passing of the events lived by the two agents, we gradually discover the Men in Black world, their weapons, the different species of extra-terrestrials who live on Earth and what their job implies (and it's not included in any job guide...).It is hard to define what is the 'meat' of the movie. It could be the duo formed by the two principal actors, the futuristic gadgets which will make salivate those who have an eye on advanced technologies or it could also be the aliens, who are CG, played by actors with special costumes or remote-controlled. In fact, there's a little bit of all this. But I'd say that the most interesting moments are those which make the audience laugh wildly.In that case, it's Will Smith who's the best. In a performance that seems to be an evolution from his hot-shot role in ""Independence Day"", Smith is incredibly funny and wacky and he always provides good laughs, should it be for moments of physical comedy or when he makes the use of jokes and irony.And what could be better to complete a jester role than combining it with its total opposite? This fact makes that the movie enters in the category of 'odd couple' films. We must admit it, Jones plays his role with professionalism and his serious and his calm of stone give him a particular look in the tongue-in-cheek style. The sequence of the car in the tunnel with Elvis Presley's ""Promised Land"" playing in the background is the best example. In fact, the only moment where he laughs, it's when he tells a joke that is so appalling that the viewer could only laugh of him and not of his joke.I also fairly loved the famous segment where K and J's boss, Zed (Rip Torn), displays pictures of real-life people who are supposed to be aliens themselves. In the lot, I've spotted Steven Spielberg (I've always told myself that he had to be from another planet), Danny DeVito (who redefines the 'little green man' term) and Sylvester Stallone (who apparently had difficulties to get rid of his extra-terrestrial accent). And at the end of the movie, we also learn that Dennis Rodman would be an alien too, which wouldn't be too surprising for obvious reasons...I've been somehow muddled by Vincent D'Onofrio's performance. Was he really there during the entire movie moving in such a mechanical way? Or was he played by a giant-sized animated puppet by moments? Anyway, in both cases, we can only raise our hat.I wouldn't say the same thing for principal actress Linda Fiorentino who looked very annoying. The end of the movie is also ambiguous.Special effects are mentionable. Aliens, even if they are totally peculiar, are well-conceived, should it be with the help of computers or from Rick Baker's hand. It must be said that the fact that the story is an adaptation of a rather unknown comic series (which also proves that comics' adaptations do not always involve superheroes), there must be a special treatment that should be brought to the presentation because comics images are rather stylized. The final result is more than satisfying.In a genre not much approached like the sci-fi comedy genre, ""Men in Black"" is probably the greatest representative of it since ""Ghostbusters"" in 1984. It's a very funny thrill ride that you would want to see again and again...",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy"
Something Completely New,"On the surface, a film featuring the straight-laced Tommy Lee Jones fighting aliens would seem to be a terrible idea. However, throw in some humor from Will Smith and some great filmmakers, and all of a sudden you have created a classic, genre-busting experience.For a basic plot summary, ""Men in Black"" sees Agent K (Jones) policing hidden aliens that constitute our planet unbeknownst to the general population. But, since K is starting to get a bit long in the tooth, he sets about bringing a little bit of new blood into the MIB organization, which is where James Edwards (Smith), an NYPD street cop, comes into the picture.The chemistry between Jones (the ""straight man"") and Smith (the ""cutup"") is what really makes this movie fun to watch. Their banter back and forth never stops from beginning to end and is always good for a chuckle.Of course, just the concept of the film alone is unique in and of itself. Though the potential for utter failure was quite high, director Barry Sonnenfield (with probably more than a little help from executive producer Steven Spielberg) manages to make the film take itself just seriously enough to work, not but not seriously enough to prevent a lot of fun from creeping into the screenplay.Overall, ""Men in Black"" is just a fun film that (in its day) was something completely new to the cinematic landscape. Unless you just really aren't into the often goofy nature of the movie, you will enjoy the special effects and witty banter thoroughly.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy"
Modern sci-fi needs to revisit this,"This movie is simply so lovable, and it has affected many people who have seen it. Men In Black has such a nice atmosphere, and it's not gritty and dark as science fiction or fantasy written these days. How many people have seen this movie and were immediately (not entirely seriously) convinced aliens have visited us? When it's a movie like Men In Black, it's so much more fun believing aliens might exist. There are movies that make aliens seem like killing machines whose only purpose is to destroy human race OR they are the kind of wise creatures who are so much better than us. But the aliens in Men In Black are - apart from the villains - almost sympathetic. They seem nice and really ordinary.Most of the charm of this movie comes from Will Smith. He is a talented actor, and his experience in comedy such as Fresh Prince of Bel Air has given him the ability to deliver comedic lines wonderfully. For him they are natural, and while Tommy Lee Jones's character Kay doesn't get as many one-liners, said by him the feeling is different.The character Jay is exactly how many of us would like to be in a situation like this. Of course the aliens and secret organisations are all new to him and he is allowed to be openly confused, but he still seems extremely excited about everything instead of being too broody or too angry like most heroes in action.This movie was made in 1990s, and the effects aren't what we see in the theaters these days, but they are still pretty damn amazing. When we are used to see the extremely beautiful science fiction, something as simple as Men In Black is a nice change.Men In Black is simple science fiction comedy. It's a movie that made me like science fiction, and is still probably the reason I'm not into the kind of science fiction where everything is in space and where you can see the filmmakers tried way too hard. Men In Black has a quite simple setting, quite simple plots and ordinary characters. Jay could be anyone of us, chosen by almost randomly instead of having some kind of great destiny. This is what science fiction needs to revisit. This is amazing.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy"
Delightfully droll,"I can understand the disappointment of those who went into this expecting to see a serious sci-fi flick. I knew it was a comedy, though, and enjoyed it. The alien effects were seamless enough, and this technology will enable film makers to get away from the relentless anthropomorphism that science fiction films get stuck in.

Highly entertaining and funny sci-fi/comedy,"I'm about 16 years late seeing this, and I saw the third one first (with no need for #2), but I must say that this is one of the most fun movie-watching experiences I've ever had. It was non-stop laughs and thrills from beginning to end. The element which stuck out to me as being done extraordinarily well was the writing, specifically the comic interplay between Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones. Their characters are so different, and yet play off each other so well. Even the smaller parts were well-written and played. Of particular amusement to me was the largely physical performance given by Vincent D'Onofrio as the main bad bug. You can tell he gave it his all with his awkward speech patterns and movements. It really seemed like he was adjusting to a human body, and it was all done with a sly sense of humor. The only thing I find lacking was some dated CG, but considering it came out over 15 years ago, it was fine. If anything it adds to the B-movie charm, and some of alien design was probably influenced by 1950's ""Creature Features"" anyway. All things considered, it was an absolutely incredible and enthralling viewing experience. It's just a shame I waited so long to check it out.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy"

Funny sci-fi: No spoofing necessary,"I'd put this in the top 5 of 1997. Men in Black is proof that  when you make a comedic science-fiction film, you don't have to do it by making fun of an existing one. I know, some people consider it a ""Ghostbusters of the 1990's,"" but I don't believe that. The Ghostbusters never hid what they were all about, in fact they were publicity hounds, who exploited it for all it was worth. The MiB's did everything possible to hide themselves, their activities, and the supernatural creatures they sought to conceal, although hiding a flying saucer from thousands of baseball fans at Shea Stadium must be quite a task.From what I know about people who truly believe that aliens are among us, the MiB's are a threat. This movie takes this portion of UFO folklore and turns it upside down.

No neuralyzer will be powerful enough to make you forget this experience ...,"Through its effective combination of action, imagery and wit, ""Men in Black"" accomplishes the same exploit than ""Back to the Future"" and deserves the title of the second most classic Sci-fi comedy ever.Indeed, being the genre that requires the most expensive budgets, the most use of special effects, art-design and make-up, and relying on the difficult premise of spectacular entertainment and philosophical insights about human condition, Sci-fi was the most likely genre to be condemned for gravity and solemnity, no matter how heart-pounding the action is. Hence the heavyweights like ""Blade Runner"", ""Terminator 2"", ""Avatar"" or more recently ""Prometheus"", when it's all about wowing the audience, plunging viewers in a world of wonders and amazement, their disbelief suspended beforehand.How refreshing now to have a movie like ""Men in Black"", one of the most original contributions to Sci-fi but never taking both genre and budget for granted, and as a result, never taking itself seriously. ""MIB"" is a hilarious spy-action-comedy involving probably the coolest-looking secret agency of the same name, well with their Ray-Ban sunglasses and black and white suits; they sure have the coolest outfits. And talk about a thrilling job: monitoring aliens who visit or live on Earth, and controlling their movements inside and outside the planet. In fact, they're not even aliens but inter-galactic immigrants.And it really suits the film that it introduces the MIB during an arrest of illegal immigrants. Agent K (Tommy Lee Jones) and his partner intercept the patrol, and quickly exposes the alien, a weird bug-eyed Mexican who doesn't seem to understand one word of Spanish. His face reveals to be a human mask only held by a creature that bears some strange resemblance –sorry for the outrageous reference- with the monster in ""Howard the Duck's"". The monster jumps on the horrified border patrolman but is immediately blown-up by Agent K spilling a disgusting blue slime all over the place and the poor guy's face.And then comes the key moment that unveils the film's most memorable device (after the black suits and sunglasses): the neuralyzer. Just one red flash, and the witness's memories of their recent sightings (and prevent the agency from some undesirable publicity) are instantly erased. Not only the poor patrolman and his colleagues have no clue about what is going on, but K's partner who feels it's time to retire will get the same treatment. He watches the stars in the dark sky and sadly declares ""I'll miss the chase"", to which K answers ""No you won't"", putting on his trademark sunglasses, and adjusting the neuralyzer.The film cuts to Edwards (Will Smith) a NYPD officer chasing an extraordinarily fast and agile criminal who leaves no doubt about his 'extra-terrestrial' background. No one believes Edwards, except for the coroner Dr. Laura Weaver who just discovered some pretty weird stuff during her autopsy, her enthusiasm will be abruptly cut in one neuralyzing flash from agent K. He confronts him with a pawnshop owner (Tony Shalhoub) in order to find out the model of weapon used by the alien, Geebs knows nothing and then the bad cop/ good cop routine is suddenly interrupted by K blowing Geeb's head off  but only as a warning, the head grows back, contributing to one of the film's most defining moment.Still, Edwards is not part of the secret anymore and as we expect, gets a little red flash in the eye (believe me, it never gets redundant) However, K finds some potential in Edwards and leaves him a business card to assist to a recruiting session. The test, the admission in the headquarters, the little aliens who specialized in making coffee, and Rip Torn as Z, the head of the agency, everything is a triumph of design and humor. The 'MIB' is like an intergalactic 'spaceport' with the widest range of Aliens' you'll find in a film, but even the most rudimentary is more convincing than ""Independence Day"" atrocious octopuses.And the place works as a galactic bureau of investigation as well with all the procedural you'd expect, and treated the most seriously. And that's the greatest thing about ""MIB"" that aliens are visiting Earth or trying to find a cover is treated as if it was the most ordinary thing in the world. In a brief screen showing different undercover aliens, we can immediately spot Sylvester Stallone, these gags are the soul of ""Men in Black"". And don't get me started with Pavillon State monument used as a disguise for two spaceships or a weird fireball being the cause of New York 1977 black-out.But these gags work less because of their content than the way they're delivered. Tommy Lee Jones, with his humorless and very matter-of-fact tone, makes the weirdest information sound totally normal, therefore more hilarious. And the funniest thing is that we end up believing him. Would you believe he'll get the hottest information from cheap tabloid newspapers? Well, in fact, given the context of the film, it all makes sense.However, the rhythm slows down a little because such a film still needs a villain who can only lead to more formulaic situation. The bad guy is played by Vincent d'Onofrio as a hillbilly whose skin was used to cover a hideous cockroach-like monster. His plot involves a small galaxy held by an Alien from an enemy planet, but it's not as creative as the whole set-up and while Fiorentino tries to find a place between the two leads, the film is never as funny and absorbing as when it involves Agent K and Agent J. The ending is perfect though with a last shot that teaches us a wonderful lesson of intergalactic-humility.As a comedy, ""MIB"" captures the existential Sci-fi spirit more than serious films : life's a joke, but stars are still beautiful to watch or to paraphrase Will Smith, the difference between ""MIB"" and other Sci-fi, is that comedy makes it look good.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy"

"Best alien comedy so far, but could be better","This is so far the best alien comedy (not movie per se - that belongs to Alien), with good performances from both Smith and Jones. As the two main MIB, they forge a partnership which can sometimes border in the insane, but as the movie progresses, you can see how they complement each other. The aliens created for this movie are also pretty much what we expect aliens to be - gross disgusting creatures, at least the ones who claim roaches as their relatives. It springs some surprises along the way, and Will Smith is great at creating certain comic effects in this movie.

Fun but totally unmemorable,"When NYPD cop Edwards pursues a subject that he believes was some form of alien he finds a mysterious agent believes him and offers him an interview. When Agent K offers him a position as a man in black he discovers an underworld of aliens that is regulated and hidden.  When a bug comes to earth in search of the universe agents K and J find themselves in a race against time to stop the bug and prevent the destruction of the earth.This film was well hyped when it first came out and got plenty of good publicity through Smith's song of the same name.  However it always felt like a film that was gearing itself up for a sequel rather than a film in itself.  The story is in two strands - the first is J's fish out of water act and the second is the search for the universe.  These two interlink as the main body is the attempt to stop the bug, but the funniest moments involve J being overwhelmed by the tings around him - in this setting he is the most accessible character to the audience as we are experiencing the same as him.  The plot is a little daft but it's all delivered with tongue in cheek and has enough laughs to keep us amused.Smith delivers yet another popcorn blockbuster and does his usual cocky performance that we've seen so many times - the only thing that stops him getting irritating is that he is clearly out of his depth in K's world. Tommy Lee Jones is very good and in my mind, a lot cooler than Smith, he does get some good deadpan lines but mainly is Smith's straight man.  It's hard to imagine anyone else doing the role as he does it so well and I hope they manage to twist the sequel to bring his character back in - I can't image Smith can carry MIB2.  Fiorentino, D'Onofrio, Shalhoub and Rip Torn all add class in support but this is mainly Smith and Jones's show.The special effects are good and the action is cool in a comic book style. However the length of the film and the focus on K and J's interaction rather than a straight up plot does make it feel like it was made with an eye on a franchise rather than the film as a complete package itself.Overall a funny stylish comedy that will amuse throughout.",,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy"

Especially good is Vincent D'Nofrio (spelling?) who plays the ""skin"". He is as hilarious with his physical quirks as he is creepy. He must be having the time of his life acting here.

Smith has shown very early in his movie career that he has a cinema presence not easily matched. My favorite part of the movie is where Jones tells Smith ""A Person is Smart. People are dumb, panicky, dangerous animals; and you know it. 1500 years ago, everyone knew that Earth was the center of the universe, 500 years ago, everyone knew that the earth was flat, and 15 minutes ago you knew that people were alone on this planet.

Invaded,"I rewatched this recently with ""Ghostbusters."" This did not age well, while the other did.I think the reason has something to do with how it was targeted.

Its fairly reliable, easy to do and rich with comic possibilities. The monsters and story and all that are merely support.The problem is that coolness gets stale quickly. So while all the secondary machinery here is still working, the core that this depends on has disappeared.The interesting thing in watching this now, is wondering about what has changed. It is that 9-11 has transformed these ""alien threat  government watchdog"" has ruined this topic for humor? Torture colors everything.Is it because these two actors have ruined their brand, drifted away from what we need for this?Is it because the expectations for what works is such a quickly evolving target that all the films that have mined this since have made this obsolete?Probably its all of these.Ted's Evaluation -- 1 of 3: You can find something better to do with this part of your life.",,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy"
Fairly entertaining sci fi comedy,"Men in Black (1997) is one of the most famous science fiction films ever. And it's probably what made Will Smith a notable actor. Men in Black is about a secret organization who polices alien activity. They know all about the alien world and keep earth and its inhabitants safe from danger when it comes to alien matters. This movie stars Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones. Jones is the elder agent in the organization and Smith plays the rookie, the new agent. The acting is skillful and I loved the way Jones and Smith both portrayed their characters. Smith does it in a very humorous way, and his comedic talent is really utilized in this film. Jones is still funny at times, but his character is very serious, but it works for his character because of things you find out about his past. I liked the screenplay alright. The really big thing that this film had going for it was the special effects, and it was good for 1997 at the time of its release, but to be honest they wouldn't be considered that impressive in today's world of cinema. The film has a very fun atmosphere to it and I would suggest it moderately. It's not the absolute best of its kind but it's still pretty fun. 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy"
The Good & Bad Of Men In Black,"A good combination of comedy, drama and sci-fi with effective special effects made this movie very entertaining and thus, a big hit.

A Great Sci-fi movie with great special effects. Good job Will Smith!!,"""Men in Black"" is a great movie, particularly for its sci-fi and dream geeks and it is the first version of the sequence. There are many things that make this movie successful. There is a great acting, fine music, and outstanding alien visuals. Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith worked as two agents for an organization that deals with aliens known as Agent J and Agent K. Will Smith is as always the the best and Tommy Lee Jones as well is not far behind anyone. This movie has plenty of great things to discuss about; it is hilarious, adventurous, and filled with action-packed series.I really love both characters as actors as both are truly the best actors in this revolutionary movie. In spite of the fact of not following the policies, J is selected over what he saw and appears to be more of a people person than the military people that are also workforce. Right from the commencement of this movie, the story catches the spectator's concentration because the viewers will have no thought to what is going on. It was not until minutes later when everything is exposed. Even after that, the spectators will have questions in large numbers. All your private questions will be answered when Will Smith comes into the equation. Once this occurs, things speed up real fast. Performing as villain, Edgar, performed as Vincent D'Onofrio. Although he's not a villain, he's just one repulsive bug-like alien. He's my favorite character in this film. The reason after this was how his personality is in general. The persona of Edgar is just simple rude. As for the special effects, they possess their own exclusivity that makes it tempting to only watch one time.'Men in Black' is energy pumping sci-fi journey that'll keep you on the edge of your seat from begin to end. The first time ever I saw this movie was when I was coming back from Miami in December, 1997. When the aliens came into view, I was scared because of the special effects. In addition, the special effects and martial arts were very well played. The most amazing part in this sci-fi movie was the best quality men's suit worn by these celebrities to make this movie outclass.

Well at least when it came out. This movie had elements that hasn't been done before it and has a simple plot but it's interesting and engaging. Alien movies has been done countless times before but what makes this movie stand out is the investigative side of it. Instead of a one side fighting another in a constant battle. I first saw this movie during my childhood and thought it was the coolest thing ever and thought the soundtrack was so awesome. Even the Will Smith rap song that went with the movie during my childhood. The plot is about a group of special people that balance out the extraterrestrial life forms that are on earth and keep things secret for the rest of the world. And also wipe out aliens that are a threat to the planet earth. As the movie progresses you learn more about how the MIB work through the eyes of agent J(Will Smith) who is a new recruit. Who does a great job with his role while adding a bit of humor into the mix. Agent K(Tommy Lee Jone) is the really serious one of the two and takes his job very very seriously and is always serious. But the pair works well in this movie. Overall this is a fun sci-fi movie that doesn't take itself too seriously and for the most part it works.7.8/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy"
"A Perfect Blend of Sci-Fi, Comedy, Action, and Will Smith at his Blockbuster Best","Whenever I'm in a movie discussion with friends and the topic drifts towards top comic book movies, I really need to remember to start including MEN IN BLACK. Released in 1997, I suppose you could say it was the first real mainstream Marvel comic adaptation (remember, BLADE wasn't released until 1998). To be honest, I wasn't even aware that it even was based on a Marvel comic until many years later. I guess the series was pretty short-lived, and the movie doesn't really do much to remain faithful to the source material. Still, a comic movie it is and it remains one of my favorites. It's funny, there's some great action, and the effects continue to hold up well even now. The Men in Black are a top-secret government organization dedicated to monitoring and policing extraterrestrial activity on Earth. When his partner retires, Agent K (Jones) sees potential in NYPD officer James Edwards (Smith). He recruits Edwards and exposes him to the truth: aliens are out there and they just want to go about their lives. Well, most of them. Edwards, rechristened as Agent J, has got his work cut out for him on his first investigation. An interstellar bug has arrived on Earth with galaxy theft on his mind, and an Arquillian battle cruiser has settled into orbit with weapons powered and intent to destroy the planet if the MiB don't provide them with said galaxy. The problem is: where does one hide an entire galaxy in the city of New York? Agents J and K had better figure it out or they won't have long to regret it.MEN IN BLACK comes from a time when Will Smith was king of the summer blockbuster. He was at the top of his money making game, and MEN IN BLACK is one of his best summer action hits. MEN IN BLACK has all of the ingredients for a hit that continues to entertain long after it's left theaters. First and foremost, it's got a perfect blend of action, comedy, and science fiction. Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones have perfect chemistry, with Smith doing his usual routine (or what once was his usual routine) and Jones as his no-nonsense partner/mentor in the life of a MiB agent. The Smith/Jones partnership is the only factor that remained cool well into the sequel, despite everything else about it failing miserably. The creature effects in this movie are, somehow, better than both sequels combined. I imagine it's because it relies more on practical effects and makeup for the various alien creatures populating this world. Rick Baker's creature effects in MEN IN BLACK are fantastic. Mikey (the illegal alien), the worms, the Arquillian ambassadorthe practical effects are the best effects. From the moment I first saw the original MEN IN BLACK, I'd hoped it would become an ongoing franchise. In my defense, that was before I knew how they'd nearly kill the franchise with the garbage that was MEN IN BLACK II. But there is still potential in the franchise; MEN IN BLACK 3 was nowhere near the train-wreck I was expecting and I would love for the series to continue on with new agents and the right writer/director.What a new MEN IN BLACK will need that the second film forgot was a strong villain. The original movie had a great alien baddie: a giant cockroach crammed in the skin of a white trash human farmer named Edgar, as played by Vincent D'Onofrio. D'Onofrio was great, giving Edgar a host of bizarre ticks and stiff movements with a full-on hatred for humankind. Then there is Linda Fiorentino as local mortician Laurel Weaver, who's only really there for plot purposes. She's also supposed to fill the role of a possible love interest for Agent J, but nothing really comes of it and, come to think of it, she doesn't really do anything in the movie. I guess Weaver could be seen as the weakest link in the film. Weak love interest aside, the rest of the film is populated with appropriately weird faces to fill it out. Rip Torn is Zed, head of the MiB, and Tony Shalhoub is intergalactic arms dealer and local pawnbroker Jack Jeebs. MEN IN BLACK is still a lot of fun more than ten years since it was originally released. After having watched the original again after so many years and finding that I love it just as much as when I saw it the first time, I think the series is due for a reboot with new agents and new sci-fi craziness.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy"

The movie doesn't take itself too seriously and treats the possibility of Earth being destroyed by a species of 15-foot-tall ""interstellar cockroaches"" as a minor irritation. By choosing one immigrant and letting the others go, Tommy Lee Jones' ""Agent K"" pays homage to Stanley Kubrick's ""Dr. Strangelove"" in this way. Jones learns that the extraterrestrial he captures is from our solar system, not Mexico. It's entertaining and cool how he uses his ray pistol to blast the alien into a viscous goo.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy"
Good quirky fun,"With Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith leading the way, this proved to be a rather entertaining movie about a secret alien society. Granted, true followers of the men in black know this stylized version of the secret organization is not true, but it is still interesting to watch. While I have never cared much for Barry Sonnenfeld's body of work, his fast paced cinematography works hand in hand with this movie, moving the viewer along at a pace which keeps them interested all throughout. Also, the creature effects were top notch, which I feel was the real scene stealer in the film. Tommy Lee Jones was exceptional, but Will Smith proved to be mostly annoying. Overall, the oddball nature of the film was rather satisfying.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy"
Pure popcorn fun of the 90's. It's all about f/x and fun.,"Men In Black gave a new direction to popcorn cinema and MTV. First, it hired the most popular actor amongst teenagers: Will Smith who was backed up by a fantastic actor such as Tommy Lee Jones.The the plot was really inventive taking in account that using words like ""scum of the universe"" sounded really cool.Now, if you mix a cool plot, charming lead actors, and spectacular f/x well you get a really entertaining flick that will be pure candy for your eyes.I have to admit that I watched this on the theaters and I had a blast! Plus I was in lust with super sexy Linda Fiorentino who wears a very short mini skirt and steals our attention.This is a classic of 90's popcorn fun.

Great fun sci-fi!,"I recently re-watched MIB. It's been years since I had last seen it, I used to love this movie as a child, but only now I can actually see how smart it really is.We follow Agent J as he discovers the truth: there is extraterrestrial life. We are just as surprised as him, and he serves as a guide to all these new crazy aliens. We also get to know the stoic agent K, with his own past and what he had to sacrifice just so he could do his job of keeping The Earth safe. We really like them throughout the movie. I don't even know if this works as a buddy cop movie, as K is more like a teacher and not only a partner.During this last re watch I could see what I believe is the central theme: ""Don't judge a book by it's cover"", or the message that you shouldn't judge anyone by their appearance because they can be so much more and surprise you. It's everywhere in the film.For example: The small gun that carries a big punch; all the aliens that look like normal humans; K's car that seems old; the aliens and the little girl in the test; and most of all, in J. In the beginning we only see him wearing these weird colorful clothes, and everyone thinks he is, well, not special. Then we see him in the suit, and he shows us what he really is about.And in the end we get a glimpse of our own irrelevance in one of the best last scenes in the history of cinema. Even the universe may not be what it seems.So, this is a great, smart movie, with a very solid story, great for children and adults alike. The effects, which stand the test of time, and details, are the cherry on top.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy"

Overrated garbage.,"Strike one for Will Smith (Strikes two, three, four, and five being WILD WILD WEST.) Okay, the premise isn't too hot, but it has a little potential. The actors are gold, and the director is good, but the movie falls flat on it's face. The jokes fail miserably, and thus the film goes down in flames. Will Smith has awful lines, and Tommy's deadpan doesn't work. The non-cgi effects are good, but this movie sports some of the most god-awful computer imagery in major motion picture history. The lack-luster premise, the dull performances, the poor sfx, the misfired jokes (BLANKMAN at least made me laugh at one point, this movie did not) and the unusual directing style meld together to make a big pile of c**p. Someone call Will Smith's agent, and someone get a pooper-scooper. This cinematic abomination is without a doubt the most overrated movie of all time. It would have failed at the box office had it not had Will Smith's name on it.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy"
Original is always best,"Back in the 80's we had ""Who You Gonna Call?"" from the movie ""Ghostbusters,"" now we have the slogan ""Protecting the Earth from the scum of the universe"" in which ""Men In Black"" deals with aliens taking over the planet as secret agents try to protect those who should live and who should be exterminated.The cast involves Tommy Lee Jones as Agent K, a no nonsense man who plays everything by the book, drives a cool black car that can flip upside down when driving in a tunnel, speaking all the languages from alien tongue to Spanish; even erasing people's memories. His partner is Agent J, played by Will Smith, in which he doesn't get what the hell is going on until the second act. And that's great about most of the Will Smith movies I have seen (ID4, I, Robot, Enemy of the State) where his character doesn't know what the hell is going on in the first act, until the second act where he takes charge and in the end, he kicks butt.The main villain is an alien from another galaxy in which he rips the body off a bumbling farmer, Edgar (Vincent D'Onifero) and inserts his body into his where the alien Edgar shocks his human wife by asking for more sugar.""Men In Black"" is the ""Ghostbusters"" of the 90's for which it balances the laughter and fun at the same time where people would not be afraid to take their little ones to see this movie.

Great Sci-Fi Flick!,"Men in Black is a great movie, especially for sci-fi/fantasy geeks. Several things make this movie work. They are superb acting, great music, and excellent alien visuals. Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith star as two agents from an agency that deals with aliens as Agent K and Agent J. J is the rookie of the group so K must train him to be a successful agent and possibly be even more. They have to deal with a bug who took a dead man's body to find a jewel and deliver the jewel to a battalion just off Earth or the planet will be blown to pieces. The acting is excellent. Will Smith is the best and Tommy Lee Jones is not far behind him. The score by Elfman is great to listen to. I also liked the Grammy-nominated song by Will Smith. The makeup and alien visuals are great and not stupid like most cheesy sci-fi flicks. This is a very good movie! I rate this movie 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy"
gettin jiggy wit da aliens,"First of all, Will Smith should not be confused with a great actor. He is great at looking cocky, looking cool, and looking confused. Tommy Lee Jones, sadly, chose this role for obvious ($$$) reasons just as he did for that debacle otherwise remembered as ""Batman Forever."" This project was not greenlit with visions of academy awards (except maybe in special effects) nor would I hope this film ever, EVER makes it into the top 250. That would be a travesty to this site. The fact it is rated as high as it is frightens me greatly (6.9 on date of comment). This was a bad film, with a bad script, and some talented people occasionally doing capable jobs.

Good entertainment.,"In all honesty, I have never been a too big fan of the Men in Black franchise. It's good entertainment all but nothing too great.And that is basically all this movie is; some good, simple entertainment. It's fun all but at the same time also rather simplistic. This especially goes for its story, which really is the foremost thing that is keeping the movie down and preventing it from ever becoming a true classic, or absolute must-see.I mean, I love the Edgar bug and Vincent D'Onofrio's performance but the whole villainous plot is kind of standard and shaky and also seems to be completely secondary for the movie as well. Really, the movie and its story are in its core all incredibly standard.Yet the movie still works out as good entertainment, which for most part is due to its two main characters and their dynamics. Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith are total opposites of each other, in about every way imaginable, which is the reason why their interactions work out as something great and amusing. Besides, they have some great chemistry together and play surprisingly well off each other. Surprising, since Tommy Lee Jones normally isn't the comedy type of guy and Will Smith at the time still had to somewhat proof and establish himself as a leading man in movies.Yes, as a comedy, or buddy flick if you will, this movie does not disappoint. It will make you laugh and keep you entertained, pretty much throughout its entire running time. It lets the time fly by really and the movie is over before you know it. It is a good thing that the movie doesn't waste any time on anything and keeps a fast pace throughout. It still has some distractions it it, which were unnecessary in my opinion, such as everything involving the Linda Fiorentino character.The special effects are all pretty good, especially also for 1997 standards. After all, it's also really still a science-fiction flick so its effects and look were also important for the movie. The movie besides uses some absolutely great makeup effects and creature design, by Rick Baker.Another thing that I'm really fond of is the musical score by Danny Elfman. It's some typical Elfman stuff, that suits the overall style and atmosphere of the movie very well. It also sadly is one of his last true great scores.All in all, really not a perfect movie but it still remains some good entertainment to watch.7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy"
"J and K, the great comic duo","Tommy Lee Jones is Agent K, a man who takes his work very seriously. He's all business, possessing no sense of humor that he is aware of. Will Smith is K's new partner Agent J. J is the flashy, showy type. Young, cool and hip, everything K is not. They are the Men in Black, part of a top-secret organization which monitors alien activity on Earth. Turns out aliens have been living among us, peacefully for the most part, for years. The Men in Black keep the alien presence under wraps. Everything is going along just fine until a Bug shows up. Now the Earth is set up for imminent destruction. Only J and K can save us. And if while saving us they can make us laugh all the better.J and K, Smith and Jones, are a terrific comic duo. They play off one another beautifully with absolutely wonderful chemistry. The obvious contrast between the buttoned-down K and the exuberant J provides plenty of comic gold. Both actors suit their parts perfectly, Smith the showman and Jones the straight man. With his wry, dry wit the supposedly unfunny K is actually one of the funniest characters you'll see. And J, new as he is to the whole aliens among us thing, provides plenty of laughs as he tries to come to grips with what the heck is actually going on. Smith and Jones are obviously the stars of the show. But they are ably supported by the likes of Rip Torn and Linda Fiorentino as well as Vincent D'Onofrio who does very well with a clearly challenging role, that of the villainous Bug who certainly doesn't blend in as seamlessly as all the other aliens populating Manhattan. It's a movie which has a great look to it, the whole menagerie of aliens look terrific, the visual effects are seamless. The story moves along well with plenty of laughs throughout. It's a movie which knows better than to take itself seriously. It's an unabashed parody and a very good one, with the great comic duo of Smith and Jones working ever so well together to put the whole thing over the top. Popcorn flick that it is Men in Black may not make many lists of the greatest movies ever. But it's hard to imagine you can watch this movie and not come away with a smile on your face.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy"
Terrific sci-fi comedy with stylish special effects stealing the show...,"For sheer entertainment, MEN IN BLACK hits the jackpot with its stylish and startling CGI effects--and is no slouch in the acting department either, with TOMMY LEE JONES and WILL SMITH making a great buddy team.Based on a Marvel comic book, it's really a series of well staged encounters with aliens as Jones and Smith attempt to save the galaxy from extinction by being able to cope with alien terrorists in our midst. No easy matter, since Smith is a rookie on the job, stumbling onto it by accident after his stunning chase scene wherein he has a brief encounter with a thing he recognizes has super capabilities. He's soon being groomed for the job of sidekick to Jones, having proved his mettle in that chase.The wisecracks back and forth never stop, the gadgets are fascinating, the plot wildly improbable--but most of it is enough to cause more than a few chuckles of laughter, if not hilarity. LINDA FIORENTINO does nicely as a sassy morgue doctor exchanging some double entendre quips with Smith as they examine one of the aliens.Aside from all the sight gags and some inside jokes at the expense of some well-known celebs, the visual splendor of the film and its New York City settings will grab your attention. A nifty score by Danny Elfman provides some appropriately zestful background music and it's all meant to be nothing more than pop culture entertainment for the masses--which it is.WILL SMITH gets to do most of the physical stunts in what has to be one of his most strenuous roles among all the action films he's done. Jones has his share of derring do--and the scene where he gets gulped down the gullet of a giant bug is quite a sight--and, of course, he lives to tell about it.The comic book capers of the MEN IN BLACK should please most fans of sci-fi fiction tinged with outrageous humor.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy"
A mediocre plotline with good special effects,"The 90s saw the emergence of excellent computer generated images being used in movies. Sadly the advances here, rarely went hand-in-hand with better stories and plotlines.

I've realised he has no talent.I strongly believe that computer technology is great for film.

Fun Entertainment,"Men in Black (1997)*** (out of 4)Good mix of comedy, science fiction and action has NYC police officer (Will Smith) recruited into a secret agency that tracks alien life form on Earth. Soon he and his partner (Tommy Lee Jones) have the biggest battle imaginable as the fate of the Earth is at risk due to an alien bug. MEN IN BLACK is far from a classic but I think there's enough imagination here for two movies and there's no question that the leads share some terrific chemistry and that alone makes the film worth watching. Again, you're life isn't going to change by watching this movie but not everything should try to be an Oscar-winning drama. There's no doubt that this is a popcorn flick but what a good one it is. I think the greatest thing the film has going for it are the two leads. These two actors are so different that it was just perfect bringing them together. Jones has no problems playing it straight while Smith can go over-the-top and silly without becoming annoying. You put the two together and they perfectly blend and really make the film what it is. Linda Fiorentino is good in her supporting bit as is Vincent D'Onofrio as the mutant trying to take over the world. The special effects in the film certainly don't hold up as well today compared to more modern CGI flicks but they're still quite nice. The imagination in the various aliens is very impressive as are some of the gadgets including the one that erases memory. MEN IN BLACK doesn't try to do anything too special except deliver a good time and it does that just fine.",,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy"
"Very similar film viewing experience to ""Ghosbusters""","I use the summary title line to infer that MIB,as was Ghostbusters before,was very much a ""cinema"" movie. In other words,if you get a chance somehow to see this on the large screen,do it! The energy,special effects and rollicking rhythm of the movie fits better on a large screen with full sound.Borrowing on elements of any alien,sci-fi movie(and a few t.v. shows,like ""Project UFO"" and ""X-Files"")and throwing in a healthy dose of humor to create a fairly unique take on the ""alien invasion"" genre.Will Smith is a NYPD detective whose pursuit of a perp has him witnessing something he didn't expect he ever would see. For this,he is recruited by a grim-looking but humored agent(Tommy Lee Jones),who proceeds to explain the mission of his organization,the Men in Black,a super-secret organization that has no official ties to the government,has been in existence for over thirty years and is ""the first,best and only line of defense"" against rogues from other galaxies. Reluctant at first,Smith's character Edwards decides to give up his identity and join this elite group,partnering with JOnes' Agent K. Their assignment happens to be none other than tracking the bug creature who has possessed the body of a loathsome Kansas redneck farmer(played with absolute physical brilliance by Vincent D'Onofrio!),who has malevolent designs on EArth and the galaxy.BArry Sonnenfeld,who also helmed ""Addams Family"" and ""Get Shorty"",is hardly what I'd consider a perfect director(""Big Trouble"",""Life With Mikey""? anyone?),but he seems right for this film,as it is played mostly for laughs,but with enough action to not bore most audiences. It's also kept juvenile enough to appeal to the kid demographic,much like ""Ghostbusters"".One last thing it has in common with it's 80s ectoplasmic cousin(besides the fact that hey were both produced by Columbia/Tri-Star)is that their sequels were watchable but nowhere near as good as the originals.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy"
Men In Black blasts its way to galactic blockbuster heights.,"If you think of 90s sci-fi blockbusters, the likes of 'Independence Day' and 'The Matrix' immediately spring to mind. However, for family entertainment one would glance at Men In Black, and for good reason. A rookie officer joins a secret organisation (MIB) which deals with immigration services for extraterrestrial life. Upon his first task, he is partnered with Agent K to save the world from a giant insect who wishes to steal a galaxy. Crazy plot sounds crazy, right? The inventive story and world building makes for an extravagantly memorable flick that boasts superior creativity. The vast array of uniquely designed aliens is something you would find in a series of 'Doctor Who'. Insects, squids and even small blobs, the clear inspirations from existing creatures make for some unique characteristics amongst the foreign members hidden within the human community. The dialogue is incredibly cheesy and surprisingly humorous with the occasional snigger here and there. The visual effects have aged well and hold up to today's standards, particularly the true form of the antagonist. Smith and Jones make for an unusual pairing, but it's with their juxtaposing characters (personality, age and race) that make for electric chemistry and the best selling point to this franchise. Annoyingly Smith also released a catchy hip-hop track with the film...and frustratingly I loved it when I was younger. The major problem with the narrative is the abhorrent inconsistent pacing. A basic plot is stretched far too thinly where many segments, including the entire second act, felt like it was going nowhere. A 98 minute film that seemed like an eternity. The final confrontation was slightly underwhelming which prevents an opportunity at showcasing the MIB gadgetry. Having said that, this still remains the benchmark for the franchise, bursting with creativity and leading comedic chemistry that evokes the fun of 90s cinema.

That formula works like magic.Of course there is other things that make this fun, like the ""aliens"" that live among us for years. You might recognize one or two of them.

Not great but worth a few laughs,"'Men In Black' is a science-fiction/comedy film involving a branch of the FBI responsible for dealing with aliens on Earth (I'm sure this involves a few people that I have met over the years.). Will Smith's character falls into a position with this department of the FBI and helps to add the comical element of the film, which is annoying at times and funny at others. If you enjoy science-fiction but are not particularly into watching a serious film, then this film is enjoyable.

"""Make them happy memories.""","Based on a Comic Book that was based on the Real-Life MiB. Yes there have actually been reports since the Fifties that after a UFO or Flying Saucer encounter, many People reported being visited by enigmatic ""Agents"" dressed all in black and wearing sunglasses.But the reports were anything but amusing to those who had the unfortunate visitation. They were usually told quite forcefully, in short, to shut-up or pay the price. These were sinister, ominous, and frightening ""People"" that some reported as being really strange with pale white skin, awkward demeanors, and uncomfortable in domestic situations. In other words they didn't quite have a handle on the Human thing and were themselves Aliens masquerading as Government Operatives.The Movie takes the concept and turned it into an offbeat Comedy that works quite well. After all, those Real-Life situations were nothing more than anxiety prone, easily traumatized, Folks who were imagining such things at best, and at worst outright Hoaxes. So none of it is to be taken seriously.Given that, this succeeds on many levels. it taps into the whole Ufology thing and spins a wild tale of a mostly benign Alien Invasion. But there are so many different types of Lifeforms that occasionally some become a threat and so the ""Black"" Ops Government tries to keep a watch on the goings and comings.This is all handled in such good spirits here that it becomes an infectious, silly romp that is immensely entertaining and a lot of fun.

However, Agent J soon finds himself thrown in the deep end when along with Agent K he must stop an Alien who has taken on the form of a farmer and whom is looking for a super power force known as the galaxy...Whilst it's plotting is fairly minimalistic and simplistic, Men In Black never takes itself too seriously and has the added benefit of Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones whom also don't take things too seriously and seem to buy into the sense of fun. Their chemistry together is good and their chalk and cheese approach to getting the job done does provide some amusing moments.The special effects aren't bad for their day and some of them even manage to look pretty ugh (which is intended as a compliment). Director Barry Sonnenfeld does a fairly good job here; although the story is no great shakes in and of itself he keeps things moving well and gets the best out of Smith and Jones which is undoubtedly the reason the films works as well as it does.The film also has humourous moments dotted throughout its runtime; mostly between Smith and Jones although one scene involving Jones and an alien dog also lingers in the memory and was one of the highlights of the film.I watched this film at the cinema nearly 24 years and remember thinking it was laugh out loud hilarious at the time.

This movie is entertainment in its purest form: strange premise and good production quality.

"Seriously, Almost 20-Years","Man, this movie is almost 20-years old. Two-years from now it will be 20-years old. I'm sure almost everyone who sees this movie, could agree that it doesn't look old and would find it hard to believe that it's 18-years old, already. I remember seeing this movie in the movie theaters as a kid. I saw it two times during that summer, and was a fan of the movie. Despite movies like these being PG-13, they expect a lot of kids under 13 to watch these movies as they're definitely entertaining for younger audiences. It's entertaining for kids to see good verses evil, or saving the Earth from aliens. So, most kids would enjoy the movie.This is one of Will Smith's most memorable movies. It came out less than a year after a higher grossing movie he was in, Independence Day which also had to do with protecting the Earth from aliens. Interestingly, if you read the IMDb trivia, you'll see that Will Smith initially did not want to accept the role, but his wife encouraged him to take the part!! Good for her, Will Smith belonged in this movie and was like perfect for the role. He wants to be in great movies, and this is probably the second highest grossing one he did, next to Independence Day. Smith's most recent movie he did, or at least the most recent movie I heard of him starring in alongside his son. I haven't heard any movies either of them have been in since, is After Earth. Although, reading the plot of the movie it might almost sound like it would be a role that would fit him after this movie. I haven't seen that movie, and it has been critically bashed. Will Smith even considered it his worst movie he's ever done. If you look at most of the IMDb reviews for that movie, most of them are negative. A lot of people reviewing that movie, no longer see Will Smith's son Jaden Smith as a good actor from his performance in that movie. The only other movie I saw him in was Karate Kid, which was a great movie and he did well for the role. So, too bad Will and Jaden had to star in a movie that hurt their careers.Well, I've mostly been talking about the actor Will Smith and his career. But, why is he great in this movie? Well, Will Smith is a cool looking guy and he also looks funny too. He can play funny roles in his movies, as he plays a very comical role as Jay in this movie. This movie is not only an entertaining sci-fi movie, but a funny one and the action in this movie isn't as serious as the action in Independence Day, it is still a funny entertaining movie with great action.It is also cool to see the technology in the movie. The technology in it seems beyond what we even have today, 18-years later. It is also cool to think of a secret organization in NYC that protects the Earth from aliens, without us ever knowing anything is wrong, along with aliens being among regular looking people in a crowd, especially in NYC.So, if you're up for an entertaining funny movie with action. If you're up for seeing an awesome movie with Will Smith in it, then this is one to see. They've done two other Men In Black movies since this one came out. I don't really care for the other two. I saw the second one, and the 3rd one I saw part of but fell asleep. But, from what I saw with the 3rd one, it didn't entertain me. I feel like the second and third one take the movies a different direction we see from the first movie, and are also more cheesy. This movie can be cheesy at times.Having a movie of an organization protecting the Earth from aliens reminds me of a show that was popular a few years before the movie came out, Mighty Morphin Power Rangers, that are more for kids than this movie though have the idea of protecting the Earth from aliens. While there are no references to Power Rangers in this movie that I am aware of, I think it would have been cool if an alien from the movie, looked like a monster from Power Rangers. It would have been cool if an actor from Power Rangers made a cameo, which we could relate to. It's cool if a movie has references to other things in pop culture. Oh well! Now that I've talked about the Power Rangers, I ought to mention that the show it was based on called Zyuranger in Japan is a better show, and more worth watching than Power Rangers.I guess, I've gone off topic and have probably talked more about Will Smith in the movie and went to other points. However, there isn't much more I can say about the movie if I don't want to talk about the plot which would count as a spoiler. To summarize briefly, this movie is a fun entertaining action movie with the plot of the M.I.B. a secret organization protecting Earth from the Extra Terrestrial, when they're threatening. It's cool to see the technology, and this is a movie Will Smith is great in.But, to conclude with movies about aliens coming to Earth. If you want to watch a movie I consider better and more entertaining, is a movie I feel is way underrated called Earth To Echo. I could even consider that movie, the greatest movie ever made!!

Men in Black,"I saw this again recently - commemorating 25 years since it's original release, and to this day I still remember the image of the little aliens with the duty-free trolley of cigarettes trying to flee Earth after we are threatened with destruction by the ""Arquillian"" empire with powerful weapons - who want their ""galaxy"" back. It falls to ""K"" (Tommy Lee Jones) and his streetwise, rookie colleague ""J"" (Will Smith) to identify then try to track down this article - and the evil beast that killed their Emperor who was carrying it - before the Imperium takes it's, literally, Earth-shattering action. There is a great dynamic between the two stars, plenty of humour to compliment the fun special effects and as we discover, loads of characters amongst the alien creatures who have been inhabiting this planet since God was a boy. The ending goes on bit, but it has stood the test of time well, and is still easily the best of this franchise.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy"
Funny and Great movie,"Men in Black was one of my favorite Hollywood blockbusters of the '90s. Watching this movie now, it has lost none of its charm. You have to love these two stars. Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith are amazing. They are a great duo on screen. These two are awesome and you can tell they enjoyed working with each other. This movie is explosive, fast paced, thoughtful, humorous, original, and even at times wise. Final point, get this movie, you won't be disappointed.As the movie progresses you learn more about how the MIB work through the eyes of agent J(Will Smith) who is a new recruit. Who does a great job with his role while adding a bit of humor into the mix. Agent K(Tommy Lee Jone) is the really serious one of the two and takes his job very very seriously and is always serious. But the pair works well in this movie. Overall this is a fun sci-fi movie that doesn't take itself too seriously and for the most part it works.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy"
Alien Movie...,"What else can you say about this, there isn't much of an idea here but it's still entertaining all the same. There isn't any Oscar winning acting or direction but it's still good to watch two guys blow up aliens and see them shoot people to make them lose their memory. I don't see any reason for a sequel but I'm sure they will make a lot of money none the less.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy"
Still great after all this time,"The men in black have been part of 'UFO-lore' almost as confused people have noticed lights in the sky and claimed that little grey men gave them a damn good probing on board the Starship Enterprise. The stories go that they're shadowy figures who cover up all traces of UFO and alien activity on planet Earth. Now, whether or not any of that is true, at the height of the nineties the X-files ruled the airwaves, therefore someone was going to transpose the men in black legend to the big screen.While die-hard UFOlogists claimed that the tone of the film was too light, it was a damn good family romp. Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith play the titular Men in Black – Jones is the hardened pro and Smith is the wise-cracking new kid on the job. When a rogue alien decides he wants to help himself to a device that will give him great power (etc) it's a race against time to prevent the planet from getting destroyed in the process. That's about all you need to know. The plot is kind of by the way when you compare it to the general fun-feeling of the film.It doesn't matter where Smith and Jones are they play off each other perfectly. That's why it shouldn't matter whether you're into sci-fi or not, you should enjoy this. It's the sort of movie that's in the same league as Indiana Jones, Star Wars and (the old) James Bond films. The whole family could sit down on a Saturday afternoon and enjoy this.It's a short and simple film (not just simple and fun to follow, but weighing in at a mere ninety minutes – quite short for a summer blockbuster). But you'll enjoy it as primarily a comedy with the science fiction part later. Give it a go. Just don't expect too much from the 'so-so' sequels!",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy"
Cute...but not for hardcore believers,"Not what I was expecting when I first heard of the movie's release. I was hoping for a scary look into the original Men In Black legend.

Will V Alien Dudes-ROUND 2,"So after the average Independance Day, Will Smith returns yet again to kick some alien ass and do it with style. Well that was the aim. Unfortunately, Mr.Smith once again signs on to a film that goes nowhere what so ever.His co star Tommy Lee Jones(Volcano) does well to keep up with his active partner but after watching the film, I was left with the question-what was it all about? The answer was nothing really. The duo were faced with the task of tracking down an illegal alien-bug-thing before it wreaks havoc on our unaware planet.Both leads do fairly well considering the nowhere plot, and support comes from Rip Torn and Linda Florentino. The special effects are decent enough but nothing we haven't seen before. In summary, the actors did well in a flawed story. Rating=3/5",,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy"

Tommy Lee Jones' finest hour and a half,"""Three Burials"" not withstanding, this is certainly Tommy Lee Jones' finest performance in mainstream cinema, even including his psychotic brilliance in ""Under Siege"".The film is funny and well-made; still I can't help wondering about the film it could have been if director Barry Sonnenfeld hadn't been so fascinated with special effects (his commentary on the DVD is just about worthless).But Jones has a charm that reminds one of early Henry Fonda - all innocence despite experience, and supremely American in the best sense - plain, honest, determined.What a weird film for Jones' talent to shine through! But that grows from his inner strength - he makes this film, not the other way around.(Too bad he felt no such urge in the horrendous sequel, MIB II. But Hollywood sequels are what they are, and that would be another review.)",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy"

Men In Black-One Helluva of Good Time!,"Men In Black was one of the biggest films of the summer in 1997. I remember seeing it at the cinema and laughing my head (substituting for another word) off. It brought in a lot of money at the box-office and continued to make Will Smith a star. This film is so wildly inventive and funny that you'll hardly care if it gets to be a tad silly. Director Barry Sonnelfeld is a talented filmmaker and has crafted a fun, highly entertaining film. So this may be one of my all-time favorite comedies, as well as one of my favorite sci-fi films. Will Smith stars as Agent Jay, who is recruited to be a part of a secret intelligence agency which deals with extra-terrestrials. Tommy Lee Jones is his partner and him and Smith embark on a mission to elimiate a lethal alien. Sure the plot is silly, but the film is hilarious. Smith and Jones have amazing chemistry and certainly prove to be a great buddy team. This film doesn't take itself too seriously which is a good thing, because as I've stated if you take this film too seriously you are certainly not going to enjoy it. Men In Black is rated PG-13 for Sci-Violence and Language. The action is bloodless, but the language is fair. Overall, a fun film which you'll have a great time with. The sequel, while not as good as the original, is still worth checking out too. Worth owning or at-least seeing.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy"
A so- so comedy/ science- fiction movie,"The sequel, in my opinion, being the worst movie ever made it's only natural for me to come back and review the first one. The concept isn't hard to grasp, there are actual aliens all over the world and in New York, there is a building which houses the ""Men in Black"". What ends up happening is an interesting blend of humor and science fiction. Will Smith plays the loud- mouth and immature Agent J with some good intensity, but he just feels to over- the- top in himself. As Agent K, Tommy Lee Jones shows a more serious side then a comic side, and he pulls off his role of a harsh but fair agent well. In support is Vincent D. as the alien they are hunting down and Rip Torn as the head of the agency. The cast isn't exactly amazing, but they do the job. The writing and direction aren't very good, the script tries to fill the movie with one- liners that are supposed to be basically a parody of anything or everything. Barry Sonnenfeld has a tough time making just a normal movie, he always seems to like going over- the- top but it drastically hurts the movie (e.g. Wild Wild West). The visual effects are quite good, with some nice attention to the little details (weapons and such). Men in Black is what'd you expect from any summer block buster, some laughs and good action. It's a solid movie, but doesn't add up too well as other movies around. 6.5/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy"
Do they think we're idiots? Yep.,"I was prepared to like this movie. I like Tommy Lee Jones, I like Will Smith, I like science fiction, and I like comedy.And then I watched the first scene, and they lost me forever. It was like a big neon sign telling me that they thought I was a moron.The people depicted in that scene go out of their way to look suspicious and to alienate (no pun intended) local law enforcement, and end the scene by letting a cop walk off with alien genetic matter all over his body. They couldn't cover up a blemish, and I'm supposed to believe that they could cover up the presence of aliens for fifty years?Sorry, Barry, I'm not that stupid.

Forgettable style,"This is an empty film. 11 years is not that much time, but it seems ages on this film. Looking at it now, makes me understand it has nothing inside.This is yet another film that develops around a certain idea of style.

Well, it's huge but understandable: style is something appealing for the crowds in the moment the film is released (though it gets easily dated) and something that doesn't require much skill to bring out. Just the right guy, in this case Will Smith who represents the top of coolness for a certain percentage of the population.The Guggenheim Museum was apparently a good choice, but misused. I wanted to see what they'd make of it, but in after all they just wanted to use the long ramp to show how Will Smith was able to run fast to the top of the building.If you see the extras on the DVD, check how Barry Sonnenfeld sounds like a nitwit.

Like Being A Little Kid...AGAIN,"Just revisited Barry Sonnenfelds great movie Men In Black. This movie has been a favourite since i was 6 or 7 years old when first viewing at my local cinema. When it was my first ever PG movie, i was enthralled by the 'baddies', the heroes, the comic book violence and the toned down language. When i watched it today, it still captured me. Remaining every bit as promising as I had remembered, and still it seemed that i should be watching something more for my age. Yet, i couldn't care less. This film is exactly why i want to make films, because its fun and if your end piece is 'enjoyable crap' rather than 'boring brilliance'; who gives a monkeys chuff anyway. The end result of this film may not be a top rated success with the critics, but it's enjoyable, fun and a roller-coaster ride of a film. I've always thought that its more important to be happy and enjoy your end piece of work than be given an award or a 100% rating success. The film itself doesn't go on any longer than it should, and doesn't remain to short to disappear from memory.Classy popcorn cinema that will always hold a place in my DVD collection.Plus....the box set was going for £3 in HMV a couple of weeks ago.

"""Totally Incognito!""","Good watch, could watch again, and can recommend.This was a better movie historically than actually. It at least felt like it introduced some concepts of having aliens infiltrated Terra into the industry, even if it didn't actually.

Or maybe I just love the concept of aliens on our planet that much.I definitely don't think it was the manner they took: the humor is as annoying as it is funny most of the time, and Tommy Lee Jones is just as funny as Will Smith (that's saying something, personally) as the straight man, credit to both of them. That said, they were a perfect for the movie, and all the supporting cast did wonderfully.Vincent D'Onofrio, as ""Not Edgar"", was probably the funniest character in the movie to me, and I don't think he was supposed to be.The ""haze the rookie by leaving out vital information"" bit is cliche and worn out, but that's have the jokes here.

"Vincent D'Onofrio was born on June 30th, 1959","Based on the comic-books of the same name, this dark-comedy, science fiction film explores the idea that aliens are already living among us in the real world and the men in black are the ones who will protect us. Director, Barry Sonnenfeld, strikes, just the right amount of gold, with this science fiction, comic book, modern classic. It also is arguably Will Smith's (Jay), best movie. Not necessarily his best performance, but his most popular film. It is a film that is pretty entertaining, technically interesting and fun to experience. It does look good on Smith's resume. It also is a good starring vehicle for Tommy Lee Jones (Kay). They work well together. It is good chemistry between their characters.Utilizing some influence from Tim Burton, Jim Henson and the X-Files, this film delivers the same chaotic alien action, complete with wild creatures and government cover-ups. A list of very competent, supporting actors, consisting of Vincent D'Nofrio, Tony Shalhaub and Rip Torn, help enhance the most important sub-genre of the film, the dark comedy. That is the most important aspect of the film, because that is the part of the film, that appeals to the wider audience and not just the science fiction nerds of the 1990s. It is a successful film, that appeals to a wide range of the audience share, which this one does because of the humor. There also is some fun action and even a few frightening moment. It was so successful, that it spawned two sequels and a reboot (that we won't talk about). Will Smith also produced a catchy tune, that everyone today knows very well.

Some parts in the film were very goofy and made no sense which kind of brought the film down. Like some parts that tried to be funny was just very stupid. The action was cool and the ending when Will Smith was battling the big cockroach was very intense and very cool. Some parts needed a lot more meaning but other than that this was a decent summer blockbusterHedeen's outlook: 7/10 **+ C+,7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy"
Nice idea but poorly executed,"I'd probably have enjoyed Men In Black a lot more if there was literally anyone else in the lead role. Will Smith's immeasurable levels of self-satisfaction make it difficult to watch his movies and this one is no exception. Aside from this minor issue, it simply isn't a very interesting story. It's mildly creative and has some amusing moments but ultimately it just isn't particularly engaging or memorable. The animation and special effects are also fairly average considering the fanfare around this movie and it all feels a little bit cheap and tacky. A fairly weak effort that received way more acclaim than it deserved.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy"
Must see for sci-fi lovers,A great sci-fi movie with good storyline and humour. Must add that the comic book well-translated onto screen.Will Smith's is his usual self with his routine comedy as Agent Jay. Tommy Lee Jones is upright Agent Kay and both of them teamed up for MIB maintain a proper balance of the story. Linda Fiorentino as Dr. Laurel Weaver has a good screen presence.Loaded with CGI and gadgets. Added to it are the aliens from outer space living with us right amongst us in the garb of humans makes this movie and interesting watch.A must for all the sci-fi movie lovers out there.,,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy"
Fun movie.,"Normally a movie that starts a saga requires strong characters, a story that facilitates the expansion of its universe, potentially attractive villains, funny supporting roles and two or three good sequences. If you have all of these then you will surely be a success. This film, fortunately, has everything necessary to be the best film of the four made so far. And the responsibility for success falls on Tommy Lee Jones who is a great actor and whose talent is impossible for him to be outshone by Will Smith. The crisis of the saga began when Will Smith became the main actor. Ultimately we find ourselves with an agency handling matters beyond our astonishment while trying to save the world from a brutal insect-like menace. The movie is very good and has the presence of Linda Fiorentino who is perfect in her role. To make the fourth film they had to convince her to come back and not do the mess they ended up doing. It is good entertainment that remains valid to this day.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy"
Average very average,"A lot of my friends kept telling me how great MIB was so my wife and I took our daughter and some of her friends to see it, when the movie was over as we were walking to our car our daughter said it was ok wasn't it ? we all nodded in agreement, it's not that MIB was bad it was just very very average, the story was long and drawn out with boring parts, on the other hand the few good parts were very good, Will Smith's dialog was snappy but Tommy Lee Jones was very dull. 6 out of 10 and lets hope the second one is better.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy"
One of my favourite movies!,"I watched this so many times on DVD, I thought I must be sick of it. Years later I just rewatched it and I still love it. None of the sequels can hold a candle to this near perfect sci-fi comedy. Will's best role, and Vincent is one of the best and most unique villains ever. Sadly the series hasn't been great after this, though part 3 is much better than 2. I give out very few 10's but this one deserves it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy"
It Worked Well because of Fiorentino!,"I have been a fan of hers since I saw her in Dogma. Now I wonder why I never noticed her before. Here she teams up with Oscar Winner Tommy Lee Jones and Oscar Nominee Will Smith as government agents to stop aliens from ruining our planet. First, the film is quite smart, witty, and works well. My favorite scenes are with Linda though not because I'm a fan of hers but she really steals the thunder and knows how to make a comeback whether verbal or physical. I don't know what happened on the set to make her the pariah of the film but she did deserve to return for the sequel. But for whatever reasons whether it was fate or her destiny, she was not and her performance in this film really shows that she can play Dr. Laurel Weaver as a smart, sensual, sexual, intelligent woman. We need more women like that and more actresses like that. She's approaching fifty now and it's not hard to believe that she wasn't even forty but she knows how to be equal with Smith and Jones. The problem might have been that it said men in black and not woman in black. I wish the best for Linda though where ever she is.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy"
Cop Tandem with Aliens,"""Men In Black"" was new, funny, and exciting when it came out in 1997. Sure, they took a tried and true formula of dissimilar cop tandem, but then they made it more than your typical cop movie. It was a cop movie with aliens. And it was awesome.Agent K (Tommy Lee Jones) was with the MIB, a super secret organization in charge of monitoring and policing aliens on Earth. He was in need of a new partner when he saw NYPD Officer James Darrell Edwards chasing down a cephalopoid. It took true skill to chase down a cephalopoid which the stoic Agent K readily recognized. From there Agent K offered James a job with the MIB. James accepted, became Agent J, and gave us an excellent movie of chasing aliens and erasing memories.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy"
The Song Os Better Than The Movie,"Continuing my plan to watch every Will Smith movie in order, I come to Men In Black (1997)Plot In A Paragraph: A New York police officer (Smith) joins a secret organization that polices and monitors extraterrestrial interactions on Earth.How do you follow the highest movie of the year, was the problem facing Will Smith, and truthfully he chose very well!! With the movie and the the song, he was everywhere!! But personally I've never really got this movie, I thought it was watchable at the time, and have never thought more about it when I have caught it on TV in the 20 years since. I always though the Will Smith song Men In Black, was better than the movie itself. The only thing I really enjoyed, was seeing Sly Stallone as one of the Aliens being monitored on a big screen.Watching it back to back with Bad Boys and Independence Day. Will Smith's cocky act is beginning to irritate me a bit. I didn't notice it at the time, as in 1997, I dancing along in night clubs to his various hit singles like Getting Jiggy Wit it, Miami and the theme song from this. Isolated it didn't bother me, watching it them together, it's a bit tiresome.Tommy Lee Jones is the best thing in this movie. His timing is perfect.Men In Black grossed $306 million at the domestic box office, to end 1996 the 2nd highest grossing movie of the year. If it wasn't for Titanic, this would have ran away with it, as it was well clear of Jurassic Park 2.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy"

"Happy Commercial Film, Maybe Too Mainstream For Me","Call me an elitist, or a movie snob or whatever... but when films are as big as ""Men in Black"" and are popular for no other reason than because they were marketed to death... I'm not going to run to my theater or video store. I think the fact it took me nine years to see this film would probably suggest that.The film stars Tommy Lee Jones as a man-in-black and Will Smith as a New York policeman who is MIB-in-training. Their boss? Rip Torn (who was outstanding in ""Dodgeball""). Their mission: to save a galaxy from an insect race of aliens.Most of the film is Hollywood excitement with very little substance. Some gun blasts, explosions and alien special effects. Not that it's bad or anything, but the actual story is fairly thin and the ""twist"" is obvious. So this is therefore the perfect date movie, especially if you're a high school kid or trying to date one.Aside from Smith and Jones, the real credit goes to Vincent D'Onofrio in his strangest role ever. He has always played a good villain, but I doubt we'll ever see him like this again. Linda Florentino (???) was also excellent, and Tony Shalhoub was decent, though he needed a bigger part.I enjoyed the opening with the Mexicans (get it? Aliens!) sneaking into America. After that, it was all pretty much what you'd expect. Nothing memorable, nothing extremely clever. Just a fun movie, something that will be replayed on TNT for years to come. (Oh, and great product placement with the Marlboro cigarettes and New Your Post. I guess the aliens are from flavor country.)I wouldn't have watched this if I hadn't been told to, and I probably never will again. I'd rather watch ""Maniac Cop 3"".",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy"

Nice and Funny...,"""Men in Black"" is an Action - Comedy movie in which we watch a police officer joining a top secret organization that control and monitor every extraterrestrial movement on Earth. He has to deal and understand something completely different than what he used to, and he needs to do it as fast as possible.I liked this movie very much because it had a nice and interesting plot that combined very well action with comedy. The direction which was made by Barry Sonnenfeld, it was very good and he succeeded on presenting very well his main characters, their differences, their dreams and also their goals, something that made more clear the plot. The interpretations of both Tommy Lee Jones who played as Agent Kay and Will Smith who played as Agent Jay were very good and their combination made the movie even better. Finally, I have to say that ""Men in Black"" is a nice, interesting and funny movie, and I highly recommend everyone to watch it because I am sure that you will have a great time and you will enjoy it.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy"
Awesome Sci-Fi Action,"One of the best science fiction action comedies ever made. The special effects are great - believable (realistic) instead of being cartoonish.

What IS it with this movie???,"People have strange attractions. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and I don't know why. I saw it twice at the cinema and I am one of those crazy people who owns this movie. I must have seen it about thirty to forty times and I still can't get to the bottom of it. It's just one of those movies that you can analyse until the cows come home but in the end it's just a very enjoyable experience. The acting was mediocre, I thought. Of course, Will Smith is hilarious in his role. I think he should take up full-time acting and leave his singing career behind. The special effects were convincing enough, nothing unique or stunning. The plot was simple yet complex enough to keep us going and the costumes were just...BLACK!! What gets me about this movie is that it doesn't try to be something special. It doesn't try to break new ground with special effects and it doesn't deliberately draw us in with moving moments and touching scenes. It just gives us a general piece of entertainment. I got the impression that I was just watching funny-guy Will Smith acting in a low-budget foreign movie with a heap of special effects. Speaking of funny, the movie was just that. That was what was also good about it. Comedy was not what I expected from this movie and I was utterly surprised when I laughed my head off in the cinema. Not something one does normally when watching a movie that has been advertised since the beginning of the year. I still don't know what it is with this movie.

One of the good summer blockbusters,"I remember when I was taken along by a friend to see Men In Black on original release, I did not expect to enjoy it very much. I had the misfortune of being taken along by the same friend to see Independence Day, a film that truly appalled me. I just couldn't help but think that this new Will Smith sci-fi blockbuster was going to be as annoying. But being the good friend I was, I accompanied him, albeit with admittedly little enthusiasm. Imagine my surprise when I had a really good time in the company of the Men In Black. Mainly this was because the jokes worked. The story about the evil aliens was strictly forgettable; it was the chemistry between the two leads and the various funny moments that made the film. I guess it's an example of what a summer blockbuster should be, i.e. it might be effects-laden but at least they are used inventively and at the heart of it all there's something genuinely amusing that doesn't take itself very seriously. I'm not exactly the world's greatest fan of these kinds of movies but the Men In Black was a pleasant surprise. And, that's it.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy"

Solid sci-fi comedy - holds up,"Science-fiction comedy Men In Black was released in 1997 and, although it did boast a hefty budget, it was a significant box-office hit spawning sequels, an animated TV series, a hit song and a reboot many years later.The film sees a secret government organization dealing with actual aliens, who have been living on and traveling to and from Earth for some time, many of them having taken on human form. The Men In Black make sure that good relations with the many different alien species are kept, that criminal aliens are caught and, of course, that the human population stays oblivious to all of this. When a flying saucer lands on Earth and the alien creature steals a farmer's skin before going on a brutal search for information about a certain hidden galaxy, it becomes up to the MIB to track him down before he causes any more damage and recover the galaxy before a rival alien ship destroys the Earth for failing to protect its royalty, who were one of the nefarious alien's first victims.Will Smith plays James, an NYPD cop who outruns a suspect only to find that he isn't exactly your typical criminal. The Men In Black soon reach him and Agent K (Tommy Lee Jones), seeing potential in him, decides to invite him for an assessment at the MIB headquarters. James proves himself very quickly and he is soon known only as J, the Men In Black's newest recruit in charge of assisting K in the apprehension of the aforementioned suspect. Along the way, J comes face to face with all sorts of aliens, rendered beautifully by Rick Baker and Industrial Light & Magic. The visual effects having aged extremely well even considering what CG is capable of nowadays, and the practical effects still just as impressive as they were watching the film for the first time back in the late 90's.Men In Black is a relentlessly clever and fun blockbuster with thrills, style and laughs aplenty, two charismatic, instantly likeable leads, a simple yet creative story with some nifty twists and turns, gorgeous visuals, of course, all sorts of cool and bizarre gadgets plus, more importantly, lots of charm. It feels every bit as original and iconic as it aimed to be but it never takes itself too seriously, which is refreshing and appropriate considering the wacky plot.Will Smith has a great time in an early-ish career-defining role, Vincent D'Onofrio is hilariously unrecognizable as the grimacing antagonist, Rip Torn is his usual confident, direct self and Tommy Lee Jones makes the perfect straight man. Ed Solomon's script is sharp and funny enough to iron out whatever little inconsistencies the story might have, to make sure that the alien gimmick doesn't wear thin after a while and to keep things both funny and exciting throughout.Revisiting Men In Black was a pleasure: it still looks great, it's still every bit the goofy, entertaining sci-fi ride you remember and it still feels like the rare kind of blockbuster where everything kinda just fits right all the way through. Barry Sonnenfeld, also known for the Addams Family movies, once again knocked it out of the park with this one.Excellent.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy"

"Fun, but Overly Cavalier","Bringing style and great physical effects, 'Men in Black' is a regarded as a timeless classic and there is good merit to this, but occasionally overdoes itself and becomes unlikeable.Will Smith is partially to blame for this - he's still in the mindset of being the funny guy from his TV show and music career, and sometimes its hilarious but often utterly dumb and doesn't gel well with the situation. Tommy Lee Jones is significantly better and is as cool headed as they come - it's one of his better performances with moments of heartfeltness. Vincent D'Onofrio is amazing and honestly doesn't really get enough screentime or intrigue for his beautiful character.What works well is the overall introduction to the organisation in addition to the set designs and location work, with credit to the screenplay and cinematography - it's a blast to watch. However the final act's script is muddled as the overall greater emergency regarding saving the world is tacked on mindlessly and detracts from an already rather shallow and silly final showdown.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy"
Comedy Sci-fi Doesn't Get Better Than This,"The word is Columbia Pictures were in dire need of a hit.

Boosted by Danny Elfman's impressive, jaunty soundtrack, laughs and surprises just keep coming.Wonderful supporting roles include Tony Shalhoub as crooked shopkeeper Jack Jeebs and Rip Torn as ""Zed"", transforming MIB 1 from a good comedy into a consistently strong, watchable parody of urban values.It's well-paced, cleverly directed with inventive makeup and ingenious CGI.

Still holds up after 20+ years,"This was my first time watching this film, as I'm intending to binge on the series before heading for the new MIB: International. I knew what to expect as the knowledge of this franchise always existed in my head.First off, the chemistry between Tommy-Lee Jones and Will Smith is really charming and appealing - almost accomplishing an unmentioned father-son bond. The contrast between Jones' deadpan delivery and Smith's energetic and hyper performance is what makes it all the more entertaining.Speaking of entertaining, the humor and wit managed to genuinely make me laugh - especially with the experienced comedy-chops of Smith and his improvised quips throughout the film. The film manages to understand its tone and bring everything to contribute to that tone - especially casting and production design.The world building is very interestingly done, with props, sets and alien design obviously influenced by the alien-craze of the 60s - when such fiction and theories about 'men in black' arose. The filmmakers established the world and the MIB agency as much as we audiences need to know in order to follow this film, while leaving a potential for more exploration in the future and sequels.Oddly, the cheesy 90s VFX of the aliens works with the weirdness of the tone of this film, and the absurdity of the concept of aliens hiding in our normal world.Not so muchI feel the film downplayed the reactions of unsuspecting humans to discovering the existence of aliens, which normally would somewhat traumatize someone and make them question their beliefs -- before finally being used to the concept. This definitely applied to Will Smith's and Linda Fiorentino's characters, who don't really seem surprised about seeing aliens for the first time ever.The plot was very convoluted, and it's almost as though there was no substantial reason as to why things were happening the way they were. The stakes were extremely elevated, but we audiences could not feel the urgency of the matter as the film didn't clearly establish why a particular McGuffin (prop of great importance) was really important to save/protect - and especially why the antagonist needed it.Will Smith's character 'J' - though entertaining - felt shallow as a written character. No backstory or any motivation for joining the MIB was explored, which would add more resonance and relatability to the character.Overall, it's a very entertaining family-friendly watch, and has gotten me excited to watch the sequels.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy"

"Like other mid-late 90s movies, this one is hard to please.","Of all the big movies released in the uncertain 1990s, FORREST GUMP, JURASSIC PARK, TOY STORY, and CLUELESS (no joke!) set all-time high water marks in innovation and creativity that equals up to timelessness. Not so with MEN IN BLACK! The costume designs and attitudes of Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones was what made it original, making this a franchise worth a hot sell, but that's the whole problem! This was Sony's finest hour back in the summer of 1997 after striving through miserable flops at the box office, only to have stumbled again with the high-tech remake of GODZILLA combined with more than $50 million of promotional advertising. Nobody wins in a game of risk when a product lacks the expectations we take for granted! It's a crying shame that Will ""Fresh Prince"" Smith's oddball acting performance kept INDEPENDENCE DAY from being a true bona fide science fiction classic, so you know what to expect from him in this movie. I'll wish him good luck on his successful music recording career. The visuals look duplicated as with other recent efforts on a budget of $70 million and the action is mighty scarce. Why in the hell does Hollywood have to blow excess dough on special effects? Just so that the audience can say ""WOW!"" or ""IT LOOKS GOOD!"" and keep coming back to the movie theater? The answer is a simple NO!! Even if MEN IN BLACK has the wow factor and looks good, it has no redeeming quality! Despite the luxury it has, the typically stupid jokes and puns contained here means it's branded as a ""comedy"", a very mainstream but tiring Hollywood genre with virtually no taste. Expect the usual things come the sequel. The future outlook is going to be terribly bleak for the big studios due to the fact that big budget movies will have all show and no go, combined with huge marketing campaigns worth millions.

The cinematography is skillful likewise with the direction, and the special effects are wonderful. The script is irreverent, and there are some truly great performances. Will Smith proves here he CAN act, and Tommy Lee Jones as usual is marvellous. Both make a unique and hilarious double act. Then there is fine support from underrated actor Rip Torn and from Linda Fiorentino, who is a talented actress that hasn't earned herself a high acting profile yet. The finale is a little overblown, but you cannot deny this is a fun film. 9/10 Bethany Cox",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy"
French Connection With Aliens,"The expression ""Men in Black"" dates back to the early 1950s. In those days it was rumored that mysterious officials in dark suits used to intimidate witnesses to alleged UFO incidents. The name was later used for a grim comic book series from Aircel Comics. However, the content is significantly lighter in director Barry Sonnenfeld's film adaptation, which mainly plays out as a family-oriented sci-fi comedy.In the movie two federal agents are set to monitor all alien-related activity on Earth. During their work, they discover an intergalactic plot that threatens the entire planet. The question now is whether they will manage to stop the diabolical plan in time.According to the original script, the action takes place all over the United States. Texas, Kansas, Nevada and Washington DC are singled out in particular. However, Sonnenfeld felt that if space aliens really wanted to settle in the country, they would probably feel most comfortable in New York City. In addition, it would be more cost-effective to concentrate the shooting to a single, specific location.Expert creature designer Rick Baker was hired to provide the animatronic aliens. Then George Lucas and his ""Industrial Light & Magic"" were responsible for the visual effects and the computer-generated imagery. But it was the charismatic performances from the two leads, Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith that really got ""Men in Black"" off the ground. Both actors truly are a joy to watch.The film collected deservedly good reviews when it opened worldwide. More surprising, though, was the judgment from another source. The site ""Bad-Astronomy"" is known for bashing sci-fi movies about their scientific blunders. (Just think of what they said of ""Armageddon"" in 1998). But of ""Men in Black"" they wrote that the film is remarkably accurate when it comes to astronomical facts. Way to go!",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy"
Worst Sci fi film,There are better comedy sci-fi films out there. The film was slow and tedious. The music was even worse sung by the same guy. Tommy Lee Jones was okay though.,1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy"
Comedy with disgusting scenes: not recommended for those who ate popcorn.,"In this comedy sci-fi movie we went into the parallel world of the MIB, special agents that regulate and supervise the entry, stay and exit of aliens on our planet, ensuring that we, humans, never know about it. For this, we follow the early career of Jay (Will Smith again fraternizing with extraterrestrials after ""Independence Day""), alongside his senior partner, Kay (Tommy Lee Jones, whom we never see a smile) in an effort to rid the world of a kind of giant cockroach, very upset with humans.The film is an adaptation of the comics by Lowell Cunningham and can largely satisfy those who read it. Its directed by Barry Sonnenfeld (who has made other comedies starring Will Smith, as ""Wild, Wild West"") and has Ed Solomon's script. The two protagonists were well up to the challenge and their interpretations were great, with perfectly memorable comic situations. Of course, being a humorous movie, no one expected to see psychologically complex characters but, nevertheless, Jones achieved this effect by showing the most dreamer and something unfortunate side of his character, which was a positive bonus in this film. The correlation between the two actors also looks very good, which helped in the interpretation of their characters. Two equally unforgettable characters are Frank, the talking pug (voiced by Tim Blaney) and the Worm Guys, which arise at some point and are recurring in the comics. The visual and special effects were very well and were effective but didn't wondered or surprised. However, the special effects aren't enough to make a movie. They aren't the movie, right?Less good points? There are few, less relevant, so we can go over them. The most important or worthy of contraindication may be the existence of some repulsive scenes, with crawling insects, viscous liquids, saliva and things like that bathing the protagonists and, surely, causing vomits in some more suggestible viewers. So, this is a good film to see ... but without consumables.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy"
Has it already been nine years since this came out?,"After his malefic, stereotypical performance in ""Independence Day"", it's a good thing that Will Smith then starred in the farce ""Men in Black"". Every part of this movie is just so cool, with Tommy Lee Jones as the straightforward government agent recruiting hip Smith to be his partner keeping aliens in line. It's hard to believe that it's already been nearly a decade since this movie first wowed us, but I guess that we should have seen it coming. As it was, it was thanks to ""MIB"" that I realized that Barry Sonnenfeld is a different person from Barry Levinson.Anyway, this is just a really neat movie. Too bad that Sonnenfeld followed it up with ""Wild Wild West"". Vincent D'Onofrio looks hilariously grotesque here as the alien masquerading as a human. Also starring Linda Fiorentino, Rip Torn, Tony Shalhoub and Carl Struycken (Lurch in the ""Addams Family"" movies, also directed by Sonnenfeld).",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy"
Satira,"If someone will search in ""MiB""'e serious attitude to the universe, the human world and Masonic underground organizations that hide the truth from us, he will surely be upset. ""Men in Black"" is a rather lightweight picture, with a dynamic plot, in which, nevertheless, there are several weighty philosophical theses. But do not think that Barry Sonnendfeld treated his work disdainfully - the brilliant cast of Tomi Lee Jones, Will Smith and Vincent D'Onofrio acts harmoniously, and the special effects even after two decades look very attractive.If anyone has not yet understood ""Men in Black"" - this is an autonomous Earth protection service. What are they guarding against? From foreign guests, all kinds of humanoids and aliens. Some, nevertheless, manage to get themselves a ""zemlyansky visa"" and get a job working in some pub or bombing the streets of New York at night. Have you watched Casablanca? Here the ""blue ball"" becomes a haven for many alien migrant workers, among whom there are scoundrels. Just in the latter case, men in black funeral suits come into play.There is no attempt on science fiction in the film. Rather, it is a kind of small satire, but, nevertheless, social satire.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy"
"1997's ""Men in Black"" is a fast, fun Sci-Fi action-comedy that remains a blast to watch even 15 years later!","Ah, the 90's. A decade that started with the dying gasps of the 1980's, before becoming its own beast entirely. This is perfectly reflected in its media and film. In particular, the absolutely fun, fast and funny action-packed Sci-Fi comedy ""Men in Black"", directed by stylish filmmaker Barry Sonnenfeld (from a script by Ed Solomon) and starring Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith.Smith stars as James Edwards, an NYPD officer who uncovers a strange and possibly extra-terrestrial threat one night while chasing down a perp on the streets. Impressed with James' feat of chasing down an alien on foot, an enigmatic and mysterious agent known only as ""Agent K"" (Tommy Lee Jones) recruits Edwards into the super-secretive agency known as the ""Men in Black"" (or ""MIB"")- a group of men and women who monitor, evaluate and police alien life on the planet Earth. Though the two men of different generations and personalities clash at first (in a way reminiscent of many buddy-comedies), they are forced to work together to stop an insect-like creature (portrayed by Vincent D'Onofio), who is seeking a mysterious artifact trapped on Earth, in a plot which could lead to the destruction of the planet.This is one of those perfect storms of a talented cast with great chemistry, a good script that flows at just the right pace, fantastic production qualities and a fine director to bring it all together. It's an absolute joy to watch even now, 15 years later.Smith and Jones are perfect in their roles: Smith as an eager, loud, almost brash young man who is unconventional by the standards of most establishments, and Jones as a semi-weary older, grumpier father-like figure trying to train younger partner. They work together with an amazing chemistry and come off as one of the most likable pairings in recent cinematic history. And their back-and-forth does provide fodder for many great jokes. D'Onofrio is a lot of fun as a slightly over- the-top villain who has stolen the skin of a farmer, which he wears like a suit, causing all sorts of fun physical gags and eccentricities. Rip Torn as the head of MIB is silly fun. And supporting roles by the likes of Linda Fiorentino, Tony Shalhoub and a voice-over role by ""Johnny 5"" himself, Tim Blaney, are perfect.The script by Ed Solomon is a lot of fun. He is able to find a happy balance between character development, action, comedic bits and the more broad Sci-Fi elements. It's an admirable script (especially compared to some of his past work), and while it may not do anything too daring, it's very solid and tightly constructed.Sonnenfeld's direction is top-notch. The visual style he built in films such as the two ""Addams Family"" flicks and his own quirky sense of humor are allowed to run wild. Sonnenfeld creates a great quirky, fun yet still slightly serious atmosphere that works perfectly in a film such as this. He was the ideal man for the job, and I don't think there is any other director who could have quite handled this film with as much class as he did.The rest of the production, including some amazing visual effects and awe-inspiring creatures created by Rick Baker. Set and costume design is top-notch. Danny Elfman's score is an absolute funky blast of memorable themes and fun action beats. This is an astonishingly well put-together film.The only real complaint I have is that the film does feel very basic at times in terms of structure. (And evidently it was subject to some big editing in post production to simplify the story) And a part of me does wish it took more chances with its material and premise.But regardless, the acting is great, the production incredible and the storytelling first class. I can't complain too much because everything is so well-done. (Although the first sequel is definitely a film I will complain about in a later review)""Men in Black"" gets a 9 out of 10. If you haven't seen it... see it now!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy"
One of My Favorite Movies of All-Time,"""Men in Black"" is one of those movies that we're thankful it was made. It definitely wouldn't get made based on the popularity of the comic books, there were only 6 comics in total that were made (except for the 3 comics that either were based on the movie or were one-shots).I never even knew that it was originally a comic book series until after I saw the movie. This movie is funny and, at some points, action-packed. This is the best Will Smith movie out there, this a great movie to see if you like Tommy Lee Jones or Will Smith. This is a great movie even if you don't like the two. I give this movie a 10 out of 10. You may disagree, but I thought that this movie was fabulous.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy"

A silly comedy for smart people.,"My Take: Hilarious special effects comedy with smart gags and a whole lot of slime.MEN IN BLACK (known simply as MIB) is yet another summer affair in an already busy affair for summer blockbusters. But like the best ones, MIB learns not to take itself too seriously. Whether it concerns that anyone on Earth is an alien, or a giant cockroach, MIB knows how to make fun with itself and happily admit that it's a comedy. And as a comedy, MIB is actually clever and ingenious. The screenplay by Ed Solomon is filled with clever gags as well as clever ideas. The film is like one clever comic book cartoon with some really smart and hilarious ideas. It is based on a famous comic by Lowell Cunnigham, so the film does the right justice to its source.Will Smith, who last appeared in another alien invasion flick INDEPENDENCE DAY, is back, and joining him is Tommy Lee Jones, and chemistry between these two characters are terrific. Like in tradition of other partners like Mel Gibson and Danny Glover in the LETHAL WEAPON series, Jones and Smith have different personalities, and the sparring between them are worth watching. Solomon's screenplay gives these two guys a lot to do. The rest of the cast have been given the same good treatment as well, which is so much to be said about other summer flicks. The story concerns MIB agents J (Smith) and K (Jones) trying to save the world from a bug-like creature, who takes the form of a Hill-billy farmer (Vincent D'Onofrio) as a sort of human disguise, to take over the world by obtaining a sort of ""Galaxy"".Then of course, there are the special effects, which are terrific. Created by the effect wizards from Industrial Light & Magic, the effects here are fun to look it, as they are plentiful. There's also a lot of help from Rick Baker, a professional with monster puppets and make-up, which brings to life a series of slimy yet creative critters as tiny alien ""worms"" or a giant cockroach that takes the skin and life of a farmer. These effects are darn good. Other than special effects are the production design created by Bo Welch, which are elaborate and fancy. Director Barry Sonnenfeld and his associates have a field day with these crazy, colorful, imaginative and, yes, slimy galaxy of visuals and creates a very stylish summer flick, but not so without substance.Rating: ****1/2 out of 5.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy"

Will Smith is a hit in Men in Black!,"What can I say about Men in Black? Well it has Will Smith in it. Need I say more? Will Smith made that movie a splash hit, with a lot of help from his Co Stars of course! Every single movie that Will Smith has made I have seen. The movies have great story lines, great plots, but Will just puts the icing on the cake for every movie he does. He adds a sense of real life to every movie he makes, and every girl swoons if they see he has a new movie out. I will be walking back to class and see lockers and lockers full of Will Smiths pictures! I see binders and binders filled with his pictures. He makes movies big hits. Every movie he does, never goes down the drain, and is one of those classic movies over and over again. I hope that he stays in movie business for a very long time. My teacher was one of the marines in the beginning of the movie, he said Will was like a normal guy. He was a excellent actor, remember everything, but a normal guy. He even played with Will's son. He's not one of those snotty actors living in billion dollar mansions, but a real guy. Some people don't like him, say he should stick to singing or playing small roles in tiny episodes. Well those people are idiots. He definitely is a great singer and absolutely, he he is a great actor. If they learn to see what I see then they will realize at last that Will Smith has got great potential and talent. I know he has been in tons of movies. But he could triple that by ten. I hope he never stops. Even in his old age he will be funny and make people grabbing there sides not to laugh. I just love Will Smith and hope on one day actually being able to meet him and tell him what a great idol he has been for me. If he can come up from the hood, and become rich and famous.

I Want To Believe,"I'm not so sure, as this movie is laughable, but doesn't negate the fact that in real life, there are actual men wearing black suits that appear during UFO sightings and landings, but they're not anything like Rip Torn, Wil Smith or Tommy Lee Jones. 'Men In Black' is, I think, more of a comedy than actually grounded in reality. It's a fun movie to watch, I admit. Love the types of aliens shown and the tech that MIB possess. BRING IT ON! I want the 'amnesia' device. I'd use it on myself. LOL! The best scene of this movie is the autopsy scene on an alien. That's more believable. I believe the scriptwriters wrote this screenplay and make it more comical than serious. I like Rip Torn's character X, but Tommy Lee Jones looks is more like an actual man in black and if there was any UFO activity in my area, his MIB would be the one I'd want to show up at my door. He's more believable. Seriously, Jones as the character K is perfect for the part, but Wil Smith as J? Not so much! I've watched this movie maybe 3 times and Jones is a much stronger character than Smith and the 'I Am Legend' actor doesn't belong in this movie, but that's just me. In the beginning, Smith plays an NYPD cop named James Daryl Edwards III who is chasing a criminal. Eventually, he is recruited by the MIB to take care of alien criminals who live on earth. The MIB strip Smith's character of his name and identity and is now known as J! Many of the shapes and sizes of the aliens shown in this movie are hilarious, including a 20 foot tall gigantic alien cockroach who resembles one of the bugs in a sequel to 'A Bug's Life' because that's what he looked like, but if there were actual aliens living on earth, they'd look more like humans, than large bugs or alien creatures with extra heads or tails. I mean, seriously? I think the TV series FRINGE's version of Men In Black looked more real than the characters in this movie and what they're all about and more grounded in truth. Even the X-Files may be more grounded in reality than this movie. I was a little surprised, though, that Rotten Tomatoes gave this movie a 92%, so I can't compete with that. I will, however, rate this an 8 to satisfy you!",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy"

This Movie's AWESOME,"Men In Black is a classic. It's not the greatest movie ever made, It's not the most stunning movie ever made, but it sure is one of the best blockbusters. The chemistry between these 2 folks is amazing. You have the grumpy I won an Oscar Tommy Lee Jones, and the energetic and young Will Smith. The movie is also hilarious! I never loved the villain because I'm afraid of bugs, and he always grossed me out. But you're not here to love the villain, you're here to have fun with the boys! I also like this movie better than any other alien movie. Wish the sequels weren't so lame though. You watch Men In Black not to watch great cinema, but to have some fun!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy"
Fun and often provocative science-fiction comedy,"Men In Black is a greatly clever and funny movie, with aliens going about their everyday lives seemingly like humans, and then the MIB serve as a patrol to stop any suspicious activity.It's a fantastic concept executed wonderfully and lead by a great duo in the form of Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith. The camera movement and score keep the anticipation, excitement, and intrigue going, almost never pausing either. The movie cracks at a good fast pace, overwhelming you within the world. The plot is provocative for audiences to consider when it comes to acceptance of what we don't understand, but mostly in humorous doses to keep entertained.Overall, a really entertaining sci-fi comedy with a different kind of perspective that keeps you laughing and thinking.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy"
DONT NETFLIX AND CHILL W THIS!!!,"A boy of interest was coming over and this was one of the first things that came up when i clicked on Action/adventure on Netflix, I decided this would be a good one considering most people think it's an oldie but a goodie... WRONG!!!!!!!!! It was the most awkward beginning to anything EVER the intro feels like it's an hour long of just following a bug around random places.. not ideal for the first ""hangout"" with a person of interest. This movie made my experience in the beginning a very awkward occasion and I am not pleased. Thank you and goodbye I hope you netflix and chillers learn from my experience",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy"
Everything about this movie still blows my mind. Even in 2019,"I remember watching this movie when I was younger and I kinda remembered parts of but I kept procrastinating watching it again now because I kinda loved it when I was younger. So finally came the day I finally decided to watch it and I must say even after all these years it's very enjoyable.I want to talk about a few aspects of the movie.The story. ( Easy to watch, engaging.
It's set in the beautiful city of New York where we are introduced to a wide selection of different characters over the course of the movie but this story is mainly focusing on 2 Men in black agents who are here to protect us all from the scum of the universe in this action/Sci-fi comedy. And of course everything no matter how bad it gets has a way to be resolved in the end after all. I don't mind it.
This was a high budget Sci-Fi movie from the late 1990s so you would expect everything to be top notch which is 100% true for this movie. The story is excellent and it grabs your attention and doesn't let it go till the last minute of the movie.
Personally I enjoyed this movie much more than a lot of other 1990s. High budget doesn't always mean an iconic movie who will be remembered even by future generations but this one managed to pull it off.Sound design - (Excellent. When I watched all the fight,action scenes the special effects gave a satisfying feedback in my ears when someone landed a shot or got knocked out. Everything music-wise felt just right like you would expect.)Cinematography (Feels like they thought about everything and it has that Transporter Miami vibe to everything.)Special effects (They are just out of this world and I was even surprised after finding out that the special effects, costumes and designs were made in the 1990s. They still look extremely well in 2019 and I would say they have done a good job and stood the test of the time.)Overall I think quite a lot of people will enjoy it and very few won't. There isn't exactly too much things to hate about it. Personally, after watching it this feels like one greatest movie 1990s movies so my rating is 10 out of 10.
Would recommend to anyone and it would be one of my first choices from the comedy/Sci-fi genre.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy"
An ageless masterpiece,"""Men in Black"" is a cult film that tells about the everyday life of a secret organization of the same name that controls the presence of aliens on Earth. All fans of shooting from big guns are welcome.The plot in the ""LVCH"" is quite schematic and is only needed to justify the action itself. The tape does not prepare any special plot twists or scripted revelations, but the story itself is strong enough, albeit unpretentious, and it is quite interesting to follow it.It should be said about the cast - Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones together formed a surprisingly funny and organic screen duo. Agent Jay is new to the business, everything is a novelty for him, and often he tries to dilute the tension with a joke of humor. Kay is already a seasoned professional in his field, for whom saving the world from an alien threat is more of a routine than an adventure. It's really interesting to follow the relationship of these two.It is worth noting that the special effects, both computer and practical, are very good at the time of release. And even though the graphics are already outdated at the moment, the film still looks quite nice.There is practically no action in LVCH as such, but thanks to the dynamic narration and the setting itself, the film does not get bored at all. The tape shows several types of aliens and how they hide among people, has a very interesting and elaborate ENT, provides the viewer with a very decent humorous component and a cool title theme written by Danny Elfman.Getting close to the finale - 'Men in Black' is a really good movie, which I have reviewed I don't remember how many times. It's light, sometimes funny and still as interesting as in the days of VHS. I recommend it.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy"
Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones=greatness,"Back in 1997, the world was entranced by this film. It was a huge hit, and deserved every bit of its success. And the reason is obvious: it's fun to see the straight-faced Tommy Lee Jones up with the always smirking Will Smith. The plot may be simple, the subplots may seem a little contrived and unnecessary, but the duo are so funny that they make up for any small flaw the film has. And perhaps the very best parts of the film are the Oscar-winning make up and special effects that back then were not only convincing, they were special. And that's the one combination that hardly ever works: sci-fi extreme and comedy. And simply but, this film does this the best since Ghostbusters.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy"
Mission: Save the world from aliens like no other.,"Either you love it or you hate it. K(Tommy Lee Jones) and J(Will Smith)are top-secret government agents, investigating alien visitations on Earth, who must stop an alien terrorist(Vincent D'Onofrio)from causing an intergalactic disaster. Witty and amazing insect-type aliens steal the show. F/X are superb. Also in the cast are Rip Torn, Tony Shaloub and the alluring Linda Fiorentino. Sci-Fi takes on a different look.",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy"
"better with time, maybe a classic","I enjoyed this movie the first time; I loved it the second time. It's one of those rare movies that's THICK enough that I can keep peeling layers back and finding something entertaining underneath. The DVD deepens the experience by giving the viewer the opportunity to look closely at effects and timing, and to get a glimpse of the ""auteur's"" intentions. This movie is on its way to being a classic.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy"
Funny,Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith were perfect for this part because they knew how to get on each other's nerves. The movie was great. Will Smith was so funny and he really made this movie a great success. This special effects were great with all the aliens and all the cool guns they were using. My favorite part was when Will Smith was stuck with a very little gun and he got all upset. This movie was great and the ride they have at Florida is the best ride I have ever went on. It is so cool. I recommend this movie to all viewers if you are a Will Smith fan and like awesome special effects.,8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy"
Fantasy Sci Fi ahead of its time,Unreal to think this is now over 20 years since it's release. Good plot. Lots of smiles with good graphics which was ground breaking.A young Will Smith who was to go onto super stardom in the key role.Very enjoyable - A good family film.,8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy"
It's bad,"Back in the late 90s, the film left me cold. In hindsight, I have to admit that I hate everything about this movie. I don't mind Will Smith. I do mind the other guy. And let's be precise about the second no-no: are men in black state funded police ? Who funds that organisation ? Is it actually secret state police ? The nazis tried that. It was called GeStaPo - Geheime Staatspolizei. Were they going for that ? The nazis had Mars ambitions, too. SciFi GeStaPo is just as awful. Thirdly, how exactly are they organised ? Do I have to start working for a government to get recruited by the men in black ? At best, the movie doesn't care about any of those issues. Or any single issue that ever mattered to me since the late 90s. Don't even watch the trailers.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy"
Clever sci-fi comedy that works on many levels,"I liked this film very much, which made how much some other people hated it surprising. Those people probably didn't understand many key elements in the movie. Part of the humor does require thought, which could be a turn off for people who don't like to think. The tie ins of the history of UFO's in US culture, the MIB, the 1964 World's fair, illegal aliens, NYC cab drivers, and particularly having the tabloids serve as the hot sheets and models of investigative journalism were hilarious. People who take those tabloids seriously might be the ones offended by this movie. The cover stories used after neuralyzing people sounded like garbled versions of the explanations given in the TV series ""Project UFO"" which dealt with the USAF's ""Project Blue Book"". K's indifference to the point of suffering from the relentless monotony of it all, taking everything in stride as an every day event, and casually, lazily, and callously treating his neuralyzed victims struck me as funny, though admittedly somewhat sadistic.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy"
Entertaining and imaginative conspiracy-lovers fantasy,"I watched this again, 20 years after seeing it for the first time, and was surprised at how well the film has aged. Po-faced Jones and smart-ass Smith are excellent as K and J, agents for the titular organisation, entrusted with saving Earth from all manner of existential threats. The script is tight and the story clever, with lots jokes about aliens living amongst us, which surprisingly (or not) includes a lot of celebrities. The CGI and makeup (by Rick Baker) is somewhat less sophisticated than what could be created now but, anchored by a good story, is more than sufficient to bring to life this entertaining and imaginative fantasy for conspiracy-lovers, UFOlogists, and anyone who likes their comedy delivered with tongue-in-cheek. Of course, perhaps it is all true...my memories of 1997 seem to have some blank spots.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy"
one of the best sci/fi comedy movies ever made,"this is a very clever and witty movie.it takes a serious subject,such as Alien Invasion and turns it on it's head.there will be a lot of laughter involved in the watching of this movie.at least there should be.the whole premise behind it is absurd,intentionally so.there's a lot of irony in this movie.Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith Play the two main Men in Black character.Jones plays agent K (Kay) and Smith plays Agent J(Jay)K is the straitlaced veteran who reluctantly trains a newcomer,Who takes the nickname or code name K(Smith)Jones and Smith work brilliantly together.Jones as the strait man and Smith as his comic foil.these two have some great comic chemistry.whoever had the idea to pair these two up deserves medal.i don't think they could have found two more perfectly suited actors on the planet.but amid all the hilarity,their is some serious stuff happening,and that is handled very well.even the serious scenes are played for laughs.this is in my top five in comedies.brilliant.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy"
Awful Film,I have absolutely no idea at all what the crew were thinking or trying to do when they were creating this awful film. This film did not make any real sense at all and did not have any real direction at all. The storyline of this film was too awful and bad and basic and poor and simple and straightforward and weak. The cast selection could have been a lot better and stronger by a long way. They did not at all commit nor connect to the storyline nor to their respective characters. There was not any sign of real chemistry at all displayed throughout this entire awful film between the cast members.,1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy"
Surprisingly good science-fiction comedy,"N.Y.P.D. Officer James Edwards gets the chance to work for world's most secret organization: MiB, the Men in Black. Their goal is to protect mankind from dangerous immigrants from outer space as well as to monitor and control all activities of alien immigrants secretly living among our society. As MiB Agent J, Edwards and his partner, K, are after a deadly alien bug that threatens the existence of our planet and has come to earth to assassin the ambassadors of another alien race, the Arquillans. Can the MiB stop the giant bug before the Arquillans declare war on our planet?I usually don't expect very much from Hollywood anymore, but ""Men in Black"" was a big surprise. It's an intelligent and VERY funny movie, featuring perfect CGI and special effects and Tommy Lee Jones at his best. The story is original too, something very rare nowadays. My only big complaint is Will Smith's annoying rap music that definitely doesn't belong to a sci-fi movie. Danny Elfman's soundtrack however is great as (almost) always. This is one of the funniest movies ever in the SF genre. And I especially liked the last scene...",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy"
Another childhood favorite,"Men in Black combines two things I loved as a kid and, to a certain extent, still do: Will Smith and aliens. Granted, it isn't his first alien movie (Independence Day came out one year earlier), but it's by far his best. At just over ninety minutes, the film is perfectly paced, developing the characters, world, and plot at a brisk yet reasonable rate. The film is endlessly quotable, with a multitude of great lines and back and forths between its two leads. And there are plenty of funny sight gags to boot.Smith is at the top of his game here. This was his third huge hit in a row, and he's a big part of the reason why. He's likeable, charming, funny, and sincere. Tommy Lee Jones meanwhile is grouchy and serious, but at the same time has a snarky demeanor that gets some big laughs. As a duo, they offset each other perfectly and are a ton of fun to watch. Vincent D'Onofrio makes for a great villain, especially in the voice, the makeup, and how he moves like the giant insect in a much smaller man's body that he is. Rip Torn is great as the heroes' boss, and there are some entertaining side characters. The only performance that doesn't really work is Linda Fiorentino; she's kind of bland. But, she isn't awful, she's not in a lot of the film and the rest of the cast more than makes up for her.This film is a prime example of why practical effects will always age better than computer generated effects. To see what I mean, watch this, them watch Event Horizon, which came out the same year. While the CGI in that film looks awful by today's standards, the makeup and costumes and puppets here still look amazing even 27 years later. This truly feels like a world that's fully fleshed out, from the effects to the costumes to the sets. Throw in some fun action scenes and an awesome soundtrack by Danny Elfman and you've got a sci-fi film that's almost as cool as The Matrix that came two years later.Overall, Men In Black is one of the most well aged movies you'll find from the nineties. It's just as enjoyable now as it was when I was a kid, and I see myself coming back to it over and over. As for the sequels, the only one I'd really watch again is the third; otherwise, I'll stick with this one.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy"
One of best movies of decade.,MIB was just a great all around movie. Very entertaining and fun to watch and is still fun to watch every so often. Very original and a great cast. The MIB 2 and 3 weren't quite as good as they seem to take a step back each sequel as is typical with MIB Int'l being the worst. Those who give this movie a poor review simply have some agenda.,10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy"
"Good flick, good cast, interesting presentation","This is a very good picture - all-round, and the five lead characters/actors are well-supported by the entire rest of the cast.While a pretty short film, and just under 1-hour and forty minutes, it seems longer because of all the story lines it presents.Both the dialog and special effects complement one another, and it blends the more ""serious"" aspects of the story with a continuing humorous approach very well.Smith, Jones and Torn are all actors whose work has been interesting and well-done in just about every film each has made, and together they provide a winning combination.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy"
Buddy cop flick with a scifi twist,"Essentially Men In Black is a buddy cop movie with a sci-fi twist. The chemistry and repartee between Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith constitute a good deal of the film's entertainment value. Smith's character J is convivial and slightly rebellious while K played by Jones(or is that Lee Jones) is more dour and proffesional. Since the film is primarily a comedy it's full of humor and never takes itself or anything too seriously. There are multiple moments where the only rational for something is that it leads to some sort of joke. But in a picture where squiggly little aliens are walking around,why bother logically criticizing every hole or goof.
Although the action in the film is very unrealistic,to say the least,I respect the way it handled the ending. Most films drag the 'grand finale' out for as long as possible piling on the action and just when you think it's over there's one more round left. But Men In Black recognizes that a twenty minute finale isn't necessary and keeps it contained and concise-without becoming too underwhelming for those passionate action lovers(or maybe it is).Check your disbelief at the door and Men In Black is a humorous and enjoyable film.",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy"
A FUN MOVIE,"I thoroughly enjoyed this funny flick! The combination of Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones was great, I found their jokes and one-liners hilirous, especially Will Smiths ""wait a minute, that was on Final Jeapardy"".The concept of aliens living on Earth is definitely not new, or the fact they were congregated in NYC, but I did like the way they had to go through customs and carry licences, very kewl.The bug alien dude was idiotic, he was actually better in his human form than the computer animated giant alien bug form. The variety of aliens of all sizes was very interesting, even a bit more varied than Star Wars!I enjoyed watching Wills efforts in getting to be a MIB agent, the part where he drags the table across the room during the exam was quite funny.Although the flick didnt have the most original plot, it is still definitely worth seeing, at least it doesn't take itself seriously like some flicks (ID4)I recommend everyone should see it!I give this 9 out of 10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy"
Hilarious.,"Stars: Tommy Lee Jones, Will Smith, Rip Torn, Vincent D'Orfornio and Tony Shaloub.This is a good example of many things. One is a great science fiction alien movie. This is probably the best alien film I've seen since Aliens. It's a good example of physical comedy. Will Smith was excellent doing physical comedy in this and Tommy Lee Jones meanwhile plays the straight man, which was just as funny as the comedy. Barry Sonnenfeld has great style which shows in all of his films, and this is no exception.My rating: *** 1/2 out of ****. 97 mins. PG-13 for violence and language.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy"
"Funny, Action-packed, Great!","Men In Black has honestly got to be one of the best sci-fi comedy's ever made. Unlike almost any alien movie that preceded it, MIB gives us another take on alien life on planet Earth and what it could be like.Will Smith and Tommy Lee-Jones have great chemistry together, full of humour and life. It's clichéd, but it works. The jokes are funny, perverse,quirky, most of all memorable. I could quote MIB for days. The script keeps you engaged with an entertaining story and various FX sequences through out. I especially liked the bad guy, Edgar. ""Edgar your skin is hanging off your bones""...classic. The FX were great, and for the most part still hold up over 10 years later. Rick Baker's aliens are creative and cool to look at to say the least.Great sci fi film i would recommend to anyone. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy"
Laugh out loud,"Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith team up in one of my top ten favorite movies of all time. Jones has the deadpan humor down while Smith plays up the comedy. There is just something about being a bungling new employee that makes for a great movie and add aliens, guns and killer actors and you have a hit. The supporting cast does a superb job of playing off Smith and Jones. I believe they were born to play this role. Its great to see Jones in such a light hearted movie. Special effects in this movie are spectacular yet subtle. With todays computer generated worlds, its easy to distinguish between real and CG. The team that worked on this movie makes it hard to tell the difference between reality and non. I could actually believe the explosions in the movie really happened. That makes for happy movie goers. And I don't know what person went to see the movie that didn't go out in search of sunglasses and a ""flashie thing"" after watching this movie.

What about the cat?,"No doubt about it, this is a really fun movie.  But I have one question: What happens to the cat?  With all the fear and heart-stopping pace in Alien, Ridley Scott found time to deal with the cat; he even made its fate part of the suspense.  So, what, is Barry Sonnenfeld in too much of a hurry to stop and let us know what happened to the cat in this light comedy? Geez.  I'm sorry, but that little loose end costs this otherwise enjoyable movie 2 points on my scorecard.  8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy"

"Strictly entertainment, and pretty good too","A mid 90's sci-fi/action flick that asks, ""How does humanity deal with the common alien invasions of Earth?"" MIB is a comical romp through the worlds of science fiction, aliens, invasions, and the secret society that protects the Earth from extraterrestrial threats. The film does a good job of creating and maintaining this top-secret culture throughout, giving it life with ""standard issue neuralizers,"" various high-tech weapons (the ""noisy cricket,"" for one), code names, a special Batmobile like vehicle in which the MIB travel, and much much more. Though nothing here is realistic, that has never been criteria for successful movie content. The believability factor is zero, but it is easy to fit one's mind into the culture of the film. This is to director Sonnenfeld's credit, as his choice of cinematographic sequences eases the moviegoer into the traditions and methods of the MIB (much as character Jay - played by Will Smith - is eased into said traditions and methods by his partner Kay - played by Tommy Lee Jones).The problem central to Men In Black revolves around a ""bug"" that has landed on Earth to capture ""the galaxy."" The MIB are charged with protecting ""the galaxy"" from the ""bug"" at all costs. The plot widens to include a developing love interest between Jay and Dr. Laurel Weaver (Linda Fiorentino), and tackles the age-old secret serviceman's dilemma - withholding information from a loved one. And will the MIB save the Earth from certain destruction by rescuing the ""galaxy?"" What will become of Jay, Kay, and Dr. Weaver? The special effects ride is nonstop entertainment all the way to a comically thrilling conclusion.The doses of humor throughout help add to the movie's action romp flavor. Casting Will Smith for the role of Jay was definitely a good choice, as he brings a life and a humor to the role that is unique to him and certainly welcome. Tommy Lee Jones plays perfectly opposite him as the grizzled veteran of many MIB campaigns. In fact, all the acting performances fit their roles, and contribute to the experience Sonnenfeld wants you to leave the theater with.So, in short, this film is strictly entertainment. It won't leave you with any deeper understanding of life, but at the end of the 98 minutes, you will have enjoyed yourself straight through. And that's not a bad thing.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy"
Fun and entertaining movie that have a charm to it,"I have fun watching this movie throughout. The story is interesting with a cop joins the Men in Black who deal with aliens who roam around Earth. I found the movie to be entertaining with the idea that is executed really well with the amount of humor and action that happen in it. I really like the different types of aliens that we see throughout the movie and the design of them are pretty creative and detail. The relationship between Agent K & Agent J is really great on how each one of them plays the polar opposite of the more experience one and the rookie. Both Tommy Lee Jones and William Smith does a great job with their performance they play in the movie and does a great job with the chemistry between them. Also, the movie has enjoyable action scenes that has tension to them and is fun to watch those scenes.Overall, it's a fun movie.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy"
MIB OWNS A SPECIAL PLACE IN MY HEART & A DEFINING FILM OF THE 90's FOR ME!!!,"Yes we all know that MIB (1997) is an absolute CLASSIC FILM!!! Everything about this movie is perfect & i loved this film ever since i first watched it at the cinema way bk in the summer of '97 & always remember when WILL SMITH name came up at the beginning all the girls cheered!!! WOW Will Smith is a super star & I've been a fan since ""Fresh Prince"" & he's my favourite actor, I've been watching Smith since then & this movie is a huge piece of Nostalgia for me & owns a piece of my movie loving heart along with the Ghostbusters films!!!Some films you just love, you can't get enough of it & always come back to a certain or a few main films among a few other's & these certain movies seem to have had a huge impact on me & i mean so much to me but if i had to narrow it all done to a single movie that i cherish the most it would Ghostbusters 2 but my Men In Black is one of my all-time top 10 also, & i love the first two MIB films as much as i love the first two Ghostbusters films. Men In Black was a major, huge movie in the 90's when I was a teenager & i loved it so much, definitely an important film to me that i hold a lot of Nostalgic affection for. Awww the start with that wonderful Danny Elfman score, pure movie magic. Men In Black is a PERFECT film, a true instant CLASSIC & one of the most ridiculously rewatchable films ever made.Will Smith is my Comfort Actor, a guy that I've probably spent more time with than my own family when growing up. I've been watching Big Will since his 90's Fresh Prince days & he's still my favourite actor.Here we have My favourite actor Will Smith in his most iconic role & the magical genius pairing of mr. Smith & the Hollywood veteran legend Mr. Jones, i adore both actors & love Rip Torn too, i love his voice R. I. P. All cement MIB as a Classic from the 1990's!!! MIB was huge in the 90's like the first TOY STORY, another major Classic from my childhood.This is Will Smith's greatest movie & his most iconic Role that will always be remembered & loved & it's definitely in my all time top 10 fave films of all time & it's so enjoyable & endlessly rewatchable, also making this since owning it on video back in the 90's it's one of my most watched films of all time.I think i love this film so much is because it's always been there from my late nights up watching it on video during the 90's & Men In Black became a ""Comfort Film"" to me & i would put it on so much that it was simply comforting to have it playing in the background & hearing the voices of these guys from like hanging out & seeing old friends again, strange maybe but true to how I've always felt about this film but my love for this particular film has bern resurrected as i loved it as the best film ever i think through the 90's but fell back into my love for my childhood favourite Ghostbusters 2, but now i appreciate the ""MIB"" even more so now as I'm a 35yr old guy who is still a huge Will Smith fan & he's still my favourite actor ever, & i can look at it the from a much more older/grown-up/mature view & i fell in love with this wonderful feelgood sci-fi buddy Comedy even more!!!. Also as an adult i feel this movie is even more special as we're now in a movie world crammed with way over budget & way over the top huge C. G. I bloated films & so my very 90's Men In Black film feels much more relaxed & easy going in flow & much more character based than c.g.i fx based, back then the Alien Creatures were mostly Animatronics & puppets with some c.g.i but now everything is c.g.i mad!!!The Amazing legendary creatures designer Rick Baker created everything special & slimey on screen so what you saw was a work of Art & hard work but now it's cheap looking computer fx & often feels soulless.There's too many perfect elements that came together to create this wonderful film & that's why it deserves to be a ""CLASSIC"" movie & it definitely is.MIB is perfect escapism from the real world. The cast is perfect, i mean the great Tommy Lee Jones partners with the super star Will Smith works perfectly with hilarious chemistry comic timing & the Biggest villain, EDGAR is one of the greatest villains ever created & that's because of vincen d'onofrios amazing & funny as hell performance. Everything just works perfectly including the comedy & the incredible iconic music & the fun tone & the action & the Awesome creatures, it's truly a CLASSIC & WILL SMITH on top blockbuster form.The 90's was Awesome & this movie was one of the biggest films of that era to impact me & made me love Will Smith even more so & got me very interested in U. F. O's which i believe in as I've seen one!!!MIB is one of those just BRILLIANT films where everything just works perfectly from the amazing cast & special fx & Beautiful music score by Danny Elfman & excellent production design & Amazing script & Comic-Sci-fi tone & all the fantasy elements to the pure 90's comforting cinematography & the lovely New York City setting during the summertime.New York City is a big character for our main characters to explore & for the Aliens to try & live normal average lives within the beautiful city.I love the easy watching & easy flowing tone to this movie, it's such a nice feelgood watch & ridiculously entertaining!!!This is definitely one of my most watched films of all time & i think i wore out my old video of it long ago.It's a Classic sci-fi film & one of the biggest & best films of the 90's as Well as an important movie for me as it made such a huge impact on me growing up, i love this film.The main charm of this film is it's pure escapism fun & nice banter-full chemistry between Smith & Jones & the great Rip Torn (RIP) is fantastic as Zed, the hit song by Will Smith has cemented this as a true 90's MASTERPIECE & time capsule of that time. I had the action figures to this film too & the soundtrack Album, oh the memories & Nostalgia are strong with this one.I have massive Nostalgia for this movie massive 90's Nostalgia as that was my era,my growing up years as a young teen & was obsessed with Men in Black & Will Smith.This first MIB movie is truly a Classic & one of my most watched & beloved movies i remember the summer it came out & i remember talking to my friends about it at school it was great times & collecting the awesome action figures & books of the film & posters, so yes this movie has had a huge impact on me growing up just like the Ghostbusters films did too.Will Smith at his absolute best & i love Smith in his great later films like I,Robot & I Am Legend & Suicide Squad & others but his first MIB film is the landmark movie that changed everything for this quick rising mega star, his ""ID4"" was obviously a huge hit but MIB cemented Smith as a global blockbuster movie star with charm & quick witted humour, goofiness & yet brave,Cool & heartfelt image, he became a Legend of Hollywood.As much as i Love most of his film especially I,Robot,MIB 2,I Am Legend, ID4,Bad Boys,Enemy of the State,MIB 3,Suicide Squad, Wild Wild West, Bright & Aladdin among other great films it's his 1997 first Men in Black film that i mostly come back to or well along with MIB2, as this is the most iconic Will Smith on screen as Agent J & it's such a good character & his MIB performance & work i think will be what Will Smith will be remembered for mostly within the movie world. A perfect blend of sci-fi Action & buddy Comedy, so thank you ""Barry Sonnenfield"" for directing this masterpiece!!! I could be Happy watched this movie everyday of my life, i wouldn't get bored & it wouldn't still Cheer me up & make me laugh. One of my favourite movie's of the 90's is ""MIB"" & my favourite movie of the early 2000's is ""I,Robot"" these flicks are important to me as a film lover & geek.Will Smith was a childhood hero of mine from his Fresh Prince days & has remained my hero still today!!!Aslo Bad Boys & Enemy of the State are big 90's films from my childhoodThere's lots of actors that i love & grew up watching & are also hero's to me (Eddie Murphy, Schwarzenegger, Estevez, Aykroyd, Chase, Roy Scheider, among others) but it's Mr. Smith that has had the most important impact on me throughout my life. The world is definitely a little bit better with Will Smith in it with us.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy"
"Here come the Men In Black, Galaxy Defenders!","MEN IN BLACKStarring: Tommy Lee Jones, Will Smith, Linda Fiorentinto, Vincent D'Onofrio and Rip TornGenre: Action/Comedy/Sci-FiRated PG-13 for Language and Sci-Fi ViolenceStar Rating: *** out of 5When there is alien scum in New York City you don't call Ghostbusters you call the MIB (Men In Black). The Men In Black is an organization that has been keeping track of aliens on Earth for over 40 years! Agent Kay (Tommy Lee Jones) tries to find himself a new partner because his old partner I think retired or something. So then he gets himself a new gets himself a new young gun partner named James Edwards/Agent Jay (Will Smith) and together Kay and Jay most stop an evil intergalactic terrorist (Vincent D'Onofrio) who has arrived on Earth to assassinate two ambassadors from opposing galaxies. In order to prevent worlds from colliding, the MIB must track down the terrorist and prevent the destruction of Earth. One of most favorite parts is when Kay and Jay are getting their weapons and Jay gets this little gun and then he says, ""Ah dang! I get the little gun."" and then he shoots it and then he goes flying back. If you like this movie I would recommend Ghost Busters, Ghost Busters 2 and Men In Black 2!

Men in Black,"This is where it all started in the Men in Black series. It stared here in 1997. Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones put together this amazing classic. Tommy Lee Jones is a federal agent that has been around for roughly 30 years thats on the brink of retirement, as his partner does at the start of the film. Their job is protecting the American public from what they do not want to know- and that is about how many aliens truly live amongst us. How some of these Aliens, in a very humorous way, are just regular common people. Will Smith character is introduced in this story as a young hot shot and hot headed New York Police officer.

Will & Tommy,"After the success of ""Independence Day"", Will Smith tackled another science fiction film though less serious than the previous one. Will is Agent Jay, recruited by Agent Kay (Tommy Lee Jones) to be his partner and replacement from the NYPD and in their first adventure together they smite an evil, annoying alien bug played by Vincent D'Onofrio.Based on a cult comic book, ""Men In Black"" was followed by an animated series and a sequel which brought back Agent Kay but used a terrible story to do it.The big reason this movie works is because Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones work so well together as the cocky youth and the experienced veteran, and they're chemistry is what made this film a hit. Some of the gags are great, others a tad predictable. Sadly, the sequel allowed them to slack and did not push them hard enough to actually work. Linda Fiorentino is nice eye candy, but Vincent D'Onofrio is never really evil or menacing as the obnoxious alien man bug Edgar, just annoying and smug. As a result of D'Onofrio's undisciplined  performance, the film is mildly irritating whenever he's on screen, sucking the joy out of it.But all in all, this one's pretty good. Will's song is actually rather catchy.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy"
A treat for both eyes and brain,"MIB is a rare thing: a Hollywood action comedy that actually has brains as well as laughs. Even rarer, the laughs are frequently unforced and underplayed (especially by Tommy Lee Jones) - which of course is much funnier. Script, direction and performances are all sharp, funny and intelligent. Special mention to Vincent D'Onofrio, whose physical performance (as a dead man's skin inhabited by a giant cockroach!) must have been extremely uncomfortable to sustain.The greatest compliment I can pay to the FX teams is to point out that the alien characters frequently switch from being Rick Baker's animatronic creations to CGI and back again within a single scene - and the two are generally indistinguishable. Great stunt work too, particularly by Keith Campbell in a stunning shot filmed on the roof of the Guggenheim Museum.Lesser directors/producers would probably have been tempted to add pointless additional action sequences that didn't serve the story, just to pad it out to the expected blockbuster length of two hours plus. Full marks to Sonnenfeld, Spielberg et al for knowing just when to end this movie and leaving the audience wanting more.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy"
"Nice, silly fun","I had reservations about this, since I didn't like Will Smith's last alien movie, INDEPENDENCE DAY, but then I saw part of a rough cut and became interested.  Seeing it in theaters, I liked it, though with some reservations.  Vincent D'Onofrio is a good actor, but all the scenes with him when he became the alien felt like they were dragging down the movie, and the alien didn't look very good either.  And Linda Fiorentino was wasted on her role, except for the scene where Smith thinks she's coming on to him, and the last scene.Still, this was fun.  I liked all the satirical pieces and the New York jokes, and I liked the way Smith and Tommy Lee Jones worked together.  As he proved with the two ADDAMS FAMILY movies, Barry Sonnenfeld knows that wacky humor comes off best when it's played as completely normal (especially Jones' reaction when Smith tells him the suspect he chased said the world was coming to an end; ""Did he say when?"").  Overall, I enjoyed it.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy"

"""They protect the world from the scum of the universe""","Two men who keep an eye on aliens in New York City must try to save the world after the aliens threaten to blow it up.Popularity, referenced/spoofed in pop-culture, and with the third along the way; I finally sit down to see Men in Black. I wasn't expecting much, I didn't expect a comedy either, but lots of surprises gave in. First off, the film is actually a spoof itself, of all the clichéd sci- fi's we have nowadays. I didn't expect it, but the film pulls it off nicely and had some great genuine comedic moments. At least THIS spoof wasn't clichéd, and actually had some cool ideas. The acting was good, and I love the combination of Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith. They fit perfectly, and without them, the film wouldn't be as great. Linda Fiorention's character wasn't too good, and seemed to be put in for guys to gawk at. Nevertheless, I still enjoyed it and it didn't affect my viewing experiences. For a film of 1997, it actually has some good special effects. The 1990s is where film's special effects broke through and changed the cinema forever, and Men in Black respectfully places itself into the list. Alongside the comedy, acting, and special effects: I give huge kudos for the soundtrack. Sure, not the biggest thing to remember and say ""hey, I love that!"" but I thought it was nicely fitting for the film. ESPECIALLY the main theme. If you love parodies, smart, fast-moving ones like Ghostbusters, you'll love Men in Black. It was a treat for 1997, a breakthrough in parodies. I recommend Men in Black. 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy"
An unforgettable 90s science fiction comedy icon,"The Earth is an intergalactic asylum since 60s where thousands of aliens in many species live their lives secretly disguising themselves as human forms. It is possible only when an agency is dealing with troubles sometimes caused by the alians and keeping everything secret. That agency is called Men in Black.The story begins when agent K, a poker-faced veteran agent played by Tommy Lee Jones, meets a streetsmart police officer played by Will Smith, who later becomes agent J. We learn the secret of the alien world as J learns from K. We walk into the MIB headquaters, where experts work with apparently advanced technology, with a sense of privilege that we get to know what the rest of the world don't.The concept of aliens disguising humans is banal, but it still works when it comes to making comedy. The villain alien Bug, who killed a poor farmer and is wearing his skin for disguise, is funnier than horrible. Outstandingly played by Vincent D'Onofrio, we can see the Bug inside the form of a human when he is staggering, driving a car, talking with his head strangely twisted.An important device for the plot is the memory-erasing neuralyzer, which is crucial to maintain the secrecy of their job. Erasing memory struck me as a very cruel thing, making they look like some kind of executioners. I felt I didn't really like them when they were using it without the slightest hesitation, but later I found the humane side of the device. And it makes the plot emotionally meaningful.Designs of aliens and machines are of what we see in typical space operas, in other words, of what children would draw on their notebooks. It's not a flaw for a science fiction comedy, making it easy for us to be familiar with. What stands out is the image of the buddy of Jones and Smith, wearing black sunglasses and black suits, strolling on streets in New York city. It's an unforgettable 90s science fiction comedy icon.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy"
"One of the Best Movies On Earth, Or Beyond","I loved this sci-fi comedy!  Will Smith certainly shows his acting skills as Agent J.

Men in Black (1997) - The Aliens! The Weapons! The Black! (Too Bad You Won't Remember This!),"Round up the weapons! Put on the shades! Strap on the suit! It's alien hunting time! ""Men in Black"" stars Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith in a science fiction alien comedy about a group of men wearing black suits to protect the galaxy from extra-terrestrials. But here's the one thing you must understand: you won't remember what has happened later! I've always loved this movie as a child, and I still love it as an adult. I've always loved the premise of the movie when these men in black show up, if somebody sees a UFO or an alien encounter, and then they zap your brain, and you forget all about it. Although this movie was incredibly short, I was easily entertained throughout. Director Barry Sonnenfeld delivers a more unique movie that redefines the genre of science-fiction. I also really loved the performances by Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith, and they also provided such a pretty great chemistry, which has later been dry in the future movies. Also, all the incredible alien make-up effects by Rick Baker are the best pieces of makeup I have ever seen, and Baker is the best in the make-up business. The visual effects are super challenging, and they are so much fun to watch on screen, when they seem to fit in with the sci-fi genre. I also enjoyed watching the talking pug dog named Frank, and some crack head worm guys which made me laugh a few times. The cast is well-acted, the effects are well-made, the art direction is totally dimensional, and the action in this movie, and the comedy, is a total must-watch to enjoy. If you are a science-fiction/comedy lover like me, you will not be disappointed with ""Men in Black"". I already seen this movie when I was little, and the thought of seeing it again, like it was for the first time, seemed so fun. This is not only one of the best sci-fi movies ever made, but this is also one of my favorite movies, as in like, ever!

Smith and Jones Lead a Flawless Cast into the Wild,"If we really aren't alone in this universe, or on this planet, I have no doubt that the government agency in charge of minding the space neighbors looks and acts just like the Men in Black. Stoic in their perfect business suits, the MiB seek to impose order on an inherently disorderly situation, taking all manner of impossible behaviors and ridiculous body types in stride without so much as a second glance. After losing his longtime partner to retirement, one such agent (Tommy Lee Jones) recruits a mouthy NYPD detective (Will Smith) as replacement and proceeds to show him the ropes amidst the latest in a series of looming existential threats from above.It's obvious that everyone involved had a lot of fun with this concept. The entire cast takes their best stab at stealing the show: Jones as the '50s G-Man stereotype, Smith as his cocksure apprentice, Rip Torn as their curmudgeonly handler, Vincent D'Onofrio as a spastic victim of body-snatching; we're truly spoiled for choice. The creature effects are appropriately playful and outlandish, as is the art direction and musical score (another characteristically quirky effort from '90s composer du-jour Danny Elfman). Director Barry Sonnenfeld allows us plenty of time to enjoy the absurdity, and for the stars to make hay with the bright, witty script, while also keeping the narrative moving and working in a few memorable, big-budget action splashes.The jokes are still funny (even though I've long-since memorized most of the punchlines), the adventure provides a perfect blend of introduction and elaboration, and the pop culture asides still work a quarter-century later. Even the CG effects haven't aged too terribly, which is a real blessing considering their essential omnipresence. Enthusiastically funny, rambunctiously fast-paced and occasionally genuine, I was surprised (and relieved) to see it's still so good.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy"

This has got to be one of the best Tommy Lee Jones films of all time and just another in a string of hits for Wil Smith. Topping it off is the acerbic characterization of Zed, performed with Panache by actor Rip Torn, who I have come to really admire. This film has everything, a total spoof of alien landings, lots of double meanings, plenty of action, and laughs a minute. Some of the funniest lines in the film were improvised, but the script is just a work of art. I could go on all day, but why.

All in Good Fun,"Firstly I'll agree with David a few reviews up in that they've stuffed up the concept of what the Men In Black are supposed to be. I too in my days of reading constantly about alien abductions and the like would always find that the MIB were alien life forms, not humans. But all I could do was sit back and say ""That's Hollywood for you"" and try to enjoy it for what it was. When I saw this in the cinema I didn't enjoy it as much as I could have as I went with someone who was not enthused to see it. Don't ever do that! Go alone if you have to. It's amazing how much that, even in a darkened room, a disenchanted person next to you can alter the atmosphere. That being said, since I've bought it on DVD and watched it many times since, it's got to be a favourite. My kids like watching it with me, which is great as it means we can sit down together to watch something and I don't have to be suffering through some kiddie stuff. Sonnenfeld seems to have found his niche of material with this sci-fi/comedy stuff, and he's hilarious on the commentary, and very insightful compared to a lot of other commentaries I've heard. The effects are great - Stan Winston is undoubtedly a master at big screen make up, and the cgi work wasn't overdone to the point where it bugged you, like a lot of films are getting to these days. I thought the pairing of Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones was pretty inspired - I'm a big fan of Tommy and it was good to see him have some fun (or as much as he can) for a change. Vincent rocked as the bug, he's so over the top he's hilarious! And so gross!!! LOL Look, it's Hollywood, so you can never expect too much. Enjoy it for what it is, and it's a movie where you can laugh, go ""oh man, gross!"" on occasion, and then have a sing to a Will Smith song at the end.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy"

This story can be reviewed an infinite number of times and it will never get bored. Yes, maybe it has its controversial points, but that's why Sonnenfeld's film belongs to the fantastic genre.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy"
Great Movie!,"I don't know what it is, but the first time I saw this film I was expecting more of a serious sci-fi movie.  But after a few repeat viewings I came to realize this is a comedy with sci-fi in it, not a sci-fi movie with comedy in it.The story is quite interesting, and very smart.  I love that the tabloids are best place to do research for MIB agents.  That's great!  There are a number of things like this that really got me laughing.  The comedy in the film is great from start to finish.  There's a few bad jokes, but the bulk of them are really good.The characters are just incredible in the film.  The interaction between Tommy Lee Jones (K) and Will Smith (J) is perfect (and hilarious), they're complete opposites, which makes them so great!  Another great addition to the film is Vincent D'Onofrio (Edgar), his acting in the film was just perfect!  And let's not forget the beautiful Linda Fiorentino (Dr. Weaver), she did a great job in the film too.  I think Rip Torn and Tony Shaloub deserve some honorable mentions as well.The special effects in the film are absolutely mind-blowing!  The scene where the Bug's ship is crash landing on earth and hits Edgar's truck is superb!  Then the entire end scene where J and K shoot down Edgar Bug's ship and then Edgar tears off his skin and becomes the bug...AMAZING!  Nearly flawless special effects!If you're in the mood for a good comedy/sci-fi movie, you should definitely watch this film!  There are so many good things about this film, you really ought to give it a shot.  I deeply hope that you enjoy the film as much as I do, but remember it may take a few repeat viewings.

Can't go wrong with Will Smith and aliens,"Men in Black is an entertaining and fun sci-fi comedy that features great chemistry between its two lead actors, Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones.

"A movie with a lot of style, and very little substance. But you know what? Doesn't matter.","The plot of aliens trying to either take over or destroy the earth has been done almost to death in recent memory. Some good (Independence Day), and some bad (Mars Attacks!). But Men in Black has something most movies don't, and that's style. This movie is just oozing with style. First of all, yes, aliens are trying to destroy the Earth, the Galaxy, whatever. The difference here is that it's not a bunch of earthlings coming together in a time of need to defend the planet from unknown life-forms. Here, aliens live among us (including Sylvester Stallone, New York weatherman Al Roker, and of course Dennis Rodman). But there are only a select group of men and women who know all about the aliens, and the rest of the planet is kept in the dark, to protect us. One of the funniest scenes is the airport-like terminal where the aliens come into the country (of course they come through New York), sometimes just for lunch. The ones sent out to protect us from the bad aliens, and to make sure the aliens conform to the alien-earthling treaties, are known as the Men in Black. Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith play K and J, two of the Men in Black. When a ""bug"" falls to Earth and wants to take over the galaxy, it's up to those two to save the day. It's the look and feel of the movie that sets it apart from the rest. It's a comedy, so the laughs are intentional, and not accidental. And surprisingly enough, it's not Smith who turns out to be the funniest one. Jones has one-liners that sound twice as funny because he's so damn serious all the time. The interaction between the two in wonderful, with Jones being the older, wiser one who knows all the tricks of the trade, and Smith being the newcomer, brash and invincible, ready to take on whatever comes his way. The special effects are actually some of the best I've seen in that they're completely seamless. Danny Elfman provides another terrific score, reminiscent of Beetlejuice and The Addams Family.

The First Of A Media Franchise,"Men In Black is a popular franchise that started out as a comic book by Marvel, but with this movie, it would spawn a franchise with sequels, a cartoon series and (as of this review) an upcoming spin-off film set in London.In this film, NYPD detective James Darrel Edwards is enlisted into the M.I.B. after trying to bust a strange person who warns him the end is coming. Now known as Agent J, he is under the mentorship of Agent K, whose old partner has retired after an incident at the Mexican Border, the two have to save the world from destruction by aliens after an alien illegally lands and aims to get a device called ""The Galaxy"".This is an awesome movie. Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith do a good job as Agents K and J, and the aliens and special effects are well done for the year the movie was made.

Men in Black - Sharp Suits and Disgusting Aliens,"In 1997, Will Smith wasn't the Oscars slapper yet, but the undisputed king of cool action. Men in Black is his calling card: sharp style, swagger for days, and one-liners that hit faster than a cockroach under a boot. Meanwhile, Tommy Lee Jones spends the entire movie scowling like he downed motor oil for breakfast, but paired with Will Smith's effortless charm, their dynamic works like a perfectly oiled Glock. The setup? Simple and brilliant: grumpy old-timer trains the rookie to handle aliens without blowing up the planet.The Men in Black arrive, and boom-pure elegance. Black suits, slick shades, and guns bigger than your shared Netflix subscription. These guys look like intergalactic funeral directors, but they're all business: shoot first, wipe memories, and wrap it up in minutes. If you feel cool wearing a Zara white shirt, just remember these guys save the universe in Prada and stay chill while facing aliens that look like amphetamine-addicted maggots.Danny Elfman on the soundtrack is like bringing a bazooka to a paintball fight: overkill, but spectacular. The opening theme launches you into the unknown like a rocket, adding punch to every scene. And the aliens? From Edgar the Cockroach to the chain-smoking worms, it's a bizarre bestiary straight out of an LSD fever dream. The effects? They've aged better than Jude Law's hair implants.The plot is as clean as their suits: hunt aliens, save the world, crack jokes, repeat. Explosions, blasters, and perfectly-timed punchlines-what else do you need? Will Smith machine-guns jokes while Tommy Lee Jones grumbles like he's at a war veterans' reunion. It's snappy, relentless, and perfectly paced.When Spielberg's name appears as producer, you know you're watching a big-budget banger. He probably greenlit this while sharing coffee with E. T. The movie even winks at itself with clever details scattered everywhere-a treat for eagle-eyed fans, but still a blast for everyone else.Men in Black is a gem of 90s entertainment: unapologetically fun, loaded with humor, and anchored by a duo in Olympic form. Add a killer soundtrack, top-tier practical effects, and aliens that are hilariously grotesque, and you've got a sci-fi comedy classic. It's a bit short, sure, but flash me with that neuralyzer-I'd happily watch it all over again.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy"
A good sci-fi action comedy with two charismatic leads,"This summer blockbuster was a big hit when it was shown on the silver screen in 1997, and while I never saw it in the 90's, I can't forget how much I saw it advertised, seeing the cover image with Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith. I saw some of it in 2000, and I think I saw the rest in 2002, the year the less popular sequel, ""Men in Black II"", was released. I think I was reasonably impressed with the original ""Men in Black"" at the time, and definitely was when I revisited it around Christmas in 2006. This was just a little less than a year after I had seen the sequel for the first time, which I didn't think much of, and knew I wasn't alone. I watched the original again last night, and have never thought of it as an amazing film, but can understand why it was such a big hit.The MIB (Men in Black) is a top secret U.S. agency that monitors and polices extraterrestrial activity on Earth and has nothing to do with the government. The planet's general population is unaware of alien life on Earth, and whenever someone outside the agency witnesses alien activity, an MIB agent erases their memory of it and replaces it! One of the top agents in this organization is Agent K. When an N.Y.P.D. officer named James Darrell Edwards III encounters a being he thinks is a human criminal but is actually extraterrestrial, Agent K is impressed by the way he handles it, and offers him to join the MIB. The catch is that in order to do so, the officer will have to give up his identity and all records of his existence! After thinking about it for a long time, he decides to take Agent K's offer. He joins the MIB and becomes Agent J! Together, K and J must track down a member of the ""Bug"" race, who has disguised himself with the body of a farmer he killed and is searching for ""The Galaxy"", a small but very powerful energy source!Tommy Lee Jones comes in around the beginning, in the role of Agent K, and it doesn't take long for him to show his charisma. When Will Smith comes into the picture, in the role of Officer Edwards (eventually Agent J), he proves to be very charismatic as well. These co-stars make a memorable team, both playing cool guys. ""Men in Black"" is billed as a sci-fi action comedy, and it really does give us all three of those genres, with interesting extraterrestrial beings, some good fight and chase scenes (making for good suspense), and such comical moments as the outcome of an alien birth in a car and the new memories the farmer's wife is given. The car speeding upside down in a tunnel is both adrenaline-inducing and humorous, and it's not the only part like that. This movie also has great visuals, with the special effects, high-budget sets, and gadgets. Sure, there may be some fairly dull parts of ""MIB"", but for the most part, it's a strong film of its genre, and very enjoyable for many of those who like modern action blockbusters.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy"

A Very Amusing and Entertaining Movie,"Before I saw this movie I thought that it was going to be a stupid science fiction spoof. Most comedies these days I have found boring and when it comes down to sci-fi alien cover-up movies, I tend to like them realistic (such as the X-files) – and this is why I approached Men in Black with intense scepticism.After seeing it I have come to the conclusion that it is a pretty cool movie. There are heaps of nice little ideas in this movie, the special effects are extremely well done, and the comedy is quite appreciable. The effects need not be commented on and the ideas and the comedy go hand in hand so this is what I will look at. I will not go too deep into much of the stuff because I feel that the movie will be spoiled. Unlike Empire Records, Men in Black is not a deep movie and as such, I can only look at the shallow nature of it. Men in Black is entertainment and that is how we must approach it. This movie is a comedy. There is the occasional political gag and a jibe at a famous person, but mostly the comedy is of the type that I really like, and that is character interaction. Will Smith plays the stereotypical, happy-go-lucky, authority-dodging, afro-American police officer. Simply put, I think he makes the movie. His attitude towards everything and the way he bounces off various situations around him create a very lively character.The aliens are extremely well done. There are the occasional human aliens, but most of them are very alien. What seems to be a human in one way will turn out to be nothing more that a vehicle carrying an alien. This is a creature canteen (using the terminology that refers to the bar seen in Star Wars) that throws as many strange creatures at the viewer as possible. The Mexican Aliens are by far the best. All in all, this is a pretty good movie. As a piece of though provoking literature, it is nothing; but as entertainment, it is great and well worth seeing.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy"

Here Come the Men in Black!,"I've always loved the MIB movies. There's just something about a secret government organization protecting the earth with suits and high-tech blasters that I like. Or maybe it's the fact that Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones have great chemistry together. It's like they were born to play these roles.My mother personally cannot tolerate these MIB films, and would rather watch MIB International. Yuck! But I love the original three. Especially this one!Vincent D'Noforio (I hope I spelled his name right) Does amazing on his role as Edgar the Bug. Can we take a moment to appreciate the writers and how clever they were to introduce a bug as a villain and adapt that character from the MIB comics? I mean, when you think of a bug, you automatically think of something disgusting and something that has to be killed or dealt with. To have a villain that's the embodiment of that, and at the same time has his humorous moments is great writing. For some reason I laugh at these lines of his: ""Listen Monkey Boy! Compared to you humans I'm on the top rung of the evolutionary ladder!"" And ""Good a war! That means for food for my family!""Will Smith was allowed to improvise on his role in this film, and he has some good lines in this film. Even though my favorite character is Tommy Lee Jones as K, I have to admit. Will Smith is the ideal package, especially considering that Agent J in the comics was white and wasn't as fun.I think it's very creative how they do the aliens in this film. The Bug wearing Edgar's skin and walking around in it may be disturbing for some viewers. It possible was for me when I first saw it, but I decided to see the creativity in it, and I enjoy seeing how funny he looks.I currently own the MIB trilogy on Blu-Ray, and I always enjoy watching this fun movie about aliens and a secret government agency. It never gets old!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy"
One of the best science fiction comedies in years.,"Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith are the two most aptly named actors (Mr. Jones and Mr. Smith) to play the intensely secretive secret agents J and K, of the Men In Black, a secret organization that protects humankind from the threat of aliens, which are a lot closer to us than we realize. The premise of the film leaves open enormous opportunities for comic relief, and they wisely make use of this, not only with Smith's seemingly endless talents (`It just be rainin' black people in New York.') but also with the ironic humor that Jones is so good at. He has developed one of the most rigid iconographies in Hollywood, but still manages to take on a wide variety of roles in more serious movies like The Fugitive and entertaining comedies like Men In Black with equal effectiveness.As is most often the case with fantastic movies like this, the thing that makes it the most interesting and believable is that it makes itself so compatible with reality. The reason that The Matrix was so good is because it left open a lot of questions that were not immediately dismissible, which is often something that brings down even the best science fiction movies. Who is to say that what The Matrix suggests, that we are all a lot of lifepods supports by machines for their own nutrition, is not true, and that we are not really only living in a reality created and implanted into our heads? Sure, it's not very likely, but it's definitely possible, which is certainly refreshing for the science fiction genre itself, which is mostly populated with laughable tales of aliens and space ships and lazer guns and whatnot.Similar to The Matrix, Men In Black suggests that the human population is heavily infiltrated with aliens that disguise themselves as humans and have a relationship with the Men In Black not too different from that that we so often see in gang movies between the police and regular criminals. Almost a teacher/pupil relationship, the aliens treat the Men In Black as obvious authority figures despite quite often being enormously superior in size.Will Smith is able to milk his part for all it's worth as the New York police officer who is a little too good for his own good, as he rushes into the Men In Black outfit, thinking that he is such a good cop that he has seen it all and can handle anything that comes his way. There are several delightful scenes that make up his introduction to the truly weird world of the Men In Black and their duties, and it comes around full circle (as usual) with Smith taking Jones's role and inserting Jones back into the normal human race with a quick flash of the deneuralyzer.Anytime civilians are exposed to the aliens or the Men In Black in the performance of their duties, they are flashed with a deneuralyzer and new memories are inserted into their heads, keeping them safely ignorant to the things that go on around them, which seems to be the way most people in this country prefer it anyway. The gadgets in the movie are some of the most interesting things in the movie, much like just about any James Bond film. The Men In Black of course have access to some truly space-age weaponry and the cars they drive are not that special looking but have some serious accessories, making them able to handle just about any alien-emergency.This is a classy, stylish science fiction movie that sets itself apart from other science fiction movies by being believable enough so that the audience doesn't sit there and try to count the times that it parts from reality. It presents some creative aliens, plenty of amusing and exciting situations, and a variety of one-liners that makes you believe that the James Bond series has miraculously not been able to pound this precious screenwriting trick into ridiculous oblivion. Entertainment for all ages. Don't miss this one.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy"
MIB,"It is hard not to love the OG MIB. Its so quirky and weird, funny and smart. Jones and Smith are perfect in here, D'Onofrio is always amazing and his turn as Edgar is no different for him. There are just so many perfect gags, lines, bits. Beyond that, it was really the movie that introduced me to Tommy Lee Jones, I loved him so much in this, his dry, old agent was played to perfection alongside the youthful antics of Smith. There are lines from this movie that have pervaded by vocabulary and dialogue throughout my life, being regularly quoted and referenced.I think, in the grand scope of action comedies, this one often gets forgotten. It doesn't quite fit the mold and more recent attempts to revitalize the franchise fell pretty flat, leaving this to linger within the neuralized portion of our brains until we happen upon it somewhere in the world with the sudden remembrance of, ""I forgot about Men in Black!

Funny/Imaginative Sci-Fi Flick,"Right from the beginning of this film, the story grabs the viewer's attention because the audience will have no idea to what is going on. It is not until minutes later when everything is revealed. Even then, the audience will have questions galore. No problem folks, all your personal questions will be answered when Will Smith enters the equation. Once that happens, things speed up real fast.Starring as the attractive lead in this film is Will Smith. Smith is New York cop who does his best to be the cop that he is. He's much better than his fellow officers, that's for sure. I love the way Smith talks. It seems very natural for him to talk the way he did. This is funny to watch because Smith's character has a wisecrack for almost any comment or explanation. Tommy Lee Jones plays the mentor of Smith. What makes Jones a good teacher is how he describes things, how he reacts to things, and how he handles things. It's all very serious but in a way, Jones is always goofing around. I really don't think he intends to, but that's how he comes off; as a joker. For example when he hands out the hand guns to Smith, he says ""Series 4 De-atomizer"". Smith's response, ""Now that's what I'm talking about"", but instead Smith is handed the ""Noisy Cricket"" which is not even big enough for a hand, more like your ring finger. Is Jones being serious, absolutely, but Smith doesn't know that! I was amazed that in the script they didn't have Smith go crazy trying to understand the logic behind every reason that was given.Playing the villain, Edgar, is Vincent D'Onofrio. Really though he's not a villain, he's just one ugly bug-like alien. He's my favorite character in this film. The reason behind this is how his character is in general. The personality of Edgar is just plain rude. A rudeness where he just wants to get what he needs in a very cumbersome fashion. One of the best characteristics I like about Edgar is the way he walks. It's a very choppy walk, almost like he has ants in his pants (pardon the pun). Edgar too, has some really funny lines. And that's is just three characters! There is so much to see here, it is unbelievable. So many aliens, so many weapons, so much fun.To wrap things up, this movie does have action, but it heavily relies on science related material. So the viewer will see a lot of explosions but that's because the Men in Black always have little trinkets up their sleeves that's not done the old fashion way. It's almost like they make reference to Inspector Gadget (1999) with all the tools they have at their disposal. The difference is that none of those things come flying out of their hats or something like that. The other great thing is the music, provided by the talented Danny Elfman. The main title itself is very catchy. The music has a very science fiction tone to it, which is good, because that magnified the feeling of it.Men In Black has witty humor and great characters that can make all the scenes a blast (sometimes literally). As for the special effects, they have their own uniqueness that makes it irresistible to only see one at a time.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy"

Good Fun,"Superior special effects and a high irreverence make this a surprisingly easy way to spend a couple of hours. The concept is inspired: the world is populated by aliens disguised as ordinary folk and there's a secret branch of the INS designed to monitor them and protect us; and some of the gags in Ed Solomon's script (based on Lowell Cunningham's comic) border on genius (tabloids are telling the truth, the New York World's Fair statues are really spaceships). The film views aliens pretty much as we view foreigners, with a mixture of wary acceptance and trepidation but that high irreverence helps us get past the barebones intimations of xenophobia. And there's a real chemistry between the two perfectly cast principals, the smooth Tommy Lee Jones and entertaining Will Smith. Smith is especially endearing: he's at ease with the mild racial quips that go hand in hand with the film's themes and proves to be a good sport. Invisibly directed by Barry Sonnenfeld, whose lack of personality is a plus: he stays out of the way of the action and lets the story and visuals unfold cleanly.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy"

The creative and imaginative designs of the extraterrestrial characters add to the film's fun and fantastical atmosphere.The chemistry between Smith and Jones is electric, and their witty banter and comedic timing keep the laughs coming.

Men In Black one of the best examples of how to make a perfect movie.,Men In Black is the citizen Kane of the Sci-Fi world and maybe one of the best examples of how to make a movie. The Story is simple There is a Agency which does not exist called MIB (Men In Black) They monitor any and all alien activity on Earth. The movie starts off with two MIB agents stopping an illegal alien from coming into the USA when the alien gets a little angry Agent Jay has to kill him. His partner feeling he's too old for this retires and Jay begins to look for a new partner which happens to be Police Detective James Darrell Edwards. Will Smith delivers the movie's maniacal energy whereas Tommy Lee Jones gives a remarkable deadpan performance that drives the movie forward. Without Mister Jones and Mister Smith it's safe to say There would not be a movie. Anyways back to the story. When Agent K played by MR.Jones trains the rookie agent J played by MR.Smith a intergalactic situation occurs. the Prince of a planet who hid out on earth is assassinated by a Bug the Prince's planet demands the return of a galaxy or earth will be destroyed and MIB is held responsible. MIB sends J and K down to retrieve the galaxy and stop the bug from escaping with the galaxy. The climax mixes horror comedy and suspense beautifully. My only complaint is the running time is too short I could have easily enjoyed another hour of Men In Black.,10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy"
Another quirky but fun sci-fi adventure film,"Men In Black was a fun goofy film. Using Will Smith's stardom, which he got from Independence Day the year before, and adding another interesting character played by Tommy Lee Jones, we end up with a hilarious spoof on all sci-fi films.The Men In Black are a secret government agency that watches over extra terrestrial activity. Both agent J (Smith) and agent K (Jones) are like a dynamic duo who must work together to stop a monstrous bug from stealing something called a Galaxy. They are given one hour, an intergalactic week, to return it to the Arquillian's or earth will face destruction.This movie had me cracking up. Will Smith was hysterical as the obnoxious J and Tommy Lee Jones was even better as K. His deadpan style of acting was just perfect for this movie, and both him and Smith have great chemistry as partners in fighting alien crime. Linda Fiorentino and Rip Torn were also very good.Men In Black does not have the greatest special effects, but the characters are so fun to watch, that you don't even care how cheesy the special effects are. In fact the characters alone put this far above many of the other trashy films of the same genre.The story was also very creative in coming up with an idea to explain why there are some unusual people in the world. I know it's only fiction, but it made me wonder still. In fact if it was true, it sure would explain a lot.This movie offers spoof after spoof, and it does so in such a deadpan style that you can't help but break out in laughter upon viewing it.

Adventures with extraterrestrial style and humor,"Could I have thought that the time would come when ""Men in Black"" could be recorded in classic tapes about space aliens? Unlikely. But decades have passed since the release of the picture, and it is one of those films that are remembered with special warmth.The plot centers on an ordinary policeman James Edwards, who suddenly finds himself in a world full of alien secrets after meeting with the mysterious agent Kay. Edwards joins the top-secret organization ""Men in Black"", whose task is to control alien creatures secretly living among earthlings. The couple is facing a threat that could destroy not only our world, but the entire Galaxy. Trying to deal with the alien danger, Agents K and Jay learn that the future of the universe is now in their hands.The plot is good. From all sides. The story develops in such a way that the viewer can hardly get bored. The film has drama, humor, and action. Everything is enough. However, the project, entertaining at first glance, is actually much deeper than it seems. Despite all the science fiction, ""Men in Black"" is a story about partnership and trust. The film skillfully plays around the question of what it means to be human, even if there are creatures from other planets living among us. At the center of the relationship between the characters lies the connection between the wise and wise Kay and the energetic but inexperienced Jay. The film asks questions about how important it is to see in a partner not just a colleague, but also a friend who will support, despite all the difficulties. Here, cosmic protection and the problems of the universe become secondary compared to human relationships.Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith made the film what it is. Jones brilliantly embodied the image of an unflappable veteran, his cold gaze and experienced approach create a perfect contrast with the frivolous and fearless Agent Jay, played by Smith. Smith brought ironic humor and energy to the film, making their couple even more memorable. Together they created a duet that perfectly balances the comical and the serious, making the picture lively and sincere.""Men in Black"" was critically acclaimed. The film won the Oscar for best makeup - and this is not surprising, given the impressive design of alien creatures and the mastery of visual solutions, which made what was happening on the screen seem even more authentic. The film also took the most prestigious Saturn statuette (The Best science Fiction Film) and was awarded several more awards, including the ""Best Song"" from MTV. In general, the project turned out to be absolutely diverse.""Men in Black"" is not only a funny and dynamic space adventure, but also a story that has a soul. The magnificent performance of Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones, the clever script and the unique aesthetics made this film one of my favorites and, rightfully, belongs to the pearls of comedy fiction.9 out of 10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy"
"Ridiculous Fun with Terrific Chemistry Between its Two Leads,","Men In Black is a terrific movie with a very well developed plot and a stellar cast. It is a very fun, imaginative film that really engrosses us in to the world of these men who hide the existence of extraterrestrial activities. We are given a great connection between Jay and Kay that it feels as if, as an audience, we are members ourselves.I did think the character development for Jay could have been better. It was understandable that Kay was mysterious, however, seeing that we follow Jay before he joined the Men in Black, it would have been a more personal story to have learned more about his past.The cast is what makes any movie and this is no exception. The chemistry between unlikely duo Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones is stellar. The way they play off one another and their comedic timing is without a doubt what makes these ninety minutes so special.The combination of a wacky story filled with many funny and lovable alien creatures, as well as a string connection for these characters, make an excellent viewing. Funny and adventurous, Men in Black is worth the watch if you are looking for a good comedy or action.After a man is roped in to joining an organisation that defends the world from aliens, he soon finds himself dealing with some serious intergalactic terrorists.Best Performance: Will Smith",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy"

The USA: A Nation Of Aliens,"When you enter the US from Europe you may hear first ""How are you doing"", usually pronounced in one word which makes it impossible to recognize its parts, the question spoken with the melody of a statement, and the continuous tense form being false, while the good and correct British ""How do you do?"" is practically out of use. Second, let's say, you need a coffee. You go to Starbucks and get one of these plastic cups carrying a paper Banderole where there stands in big letters: CAUTION! CONTAINS HOT LIQUID. When you visit the restroom, you find a tetrahedron-like warning shield placed on the obviously wet soil telling you: DANGER! WET FLOOR! Later, in the taxi, you read in the rear-view mirror: OBJECTS IN THE MIRROR ARE CLOSER THAN THEY APPEAR.If you want or not: Coming from a land where neither the coffee-shops nor the cleaning company nor the car-producers are nursing you, you will ask yourself: What is this for a land where the self-evident things are told even to adults, things which are know already by children in the rest of the world? Obviously, you conclude, here there lives a species of beings that MUST be told that, since otherwise nobody would go through all the pain and costs for all those warnings. So, you ask one of the inhabitants of this country, and he tells you that recently a lung cancer patient who had smoked for forty years sued Philips, telling the court-house that this tobacco company did not warn him of the dangers of smoking - and won the process. At that point, as an educated European, you may ask yourself: Are these really humans that inhabit this gigantic country between Montana and Mississippi, California and New England, because both the stupidity of their behavior and the credulity of their court-houses seem to contradict strongly to that assumption. You may also get suspicious when you enter a store and ask a cashier, who is just busy to serve another customer, where the paper products are. Unlike in any other country, she will stay calm, put on her most agreeable smile, show you her Pepsodent teeth and direct you kindly to aisle number eleven. When you then look at the people in queue whose time you have stolen with your stupid question, you will encounter the same artificial and mechanical smile remembering you perhaps of E.T.A. Hoffmann's Olympia and the unhappy Professor Mosh Terpin who invented her. Now you count one and one together, since you feel strongly that you are on a hot trail. Perhaps you remember the people showing up in the famous old American movies of the 30ies or 40ies: Hardly any difference to Europeans (besides the language), educated, cultivated, polite but not automate with a mechanical make-up grinning. Then, the most horrible suspicion comes into your brain: WHAT HAPPENED OUT OF THE Americans OF THE 40IES? -. They are gone! Absolutely for sure the people who nowadays inhabit America are nothing but aliens, placed on both sides of the Apalachians after the original cultivated race has been high-jacked, leaving back a class of low lives who are behind the Central African states in the international PISA evaluation of the world-education, who clothe in jeans, sandals and speak as if they are born with a chewing gum in their mouth, who love to play war, do not speak one foreign language and not even their own in a proper way - and, consistently, as you now start to realize, have to be told that hot stuff can burn, mirrors distort distances, water on soil is slippery, in one word: that one first has to close a door before it can be shut. And then, after a long time, you find this marvelous film: MEN IN BLACK, the title purposely without significance, so that nobody gets suspicious of its content. After having watched this movie, you, who understands, recognize that the crew who made this movie is obviously the last rest of people who could rescue themselves when their relatives had been high-jacked and replaced by the aliens. Working in the underground, they used the genre of comedy, again, in order to avoid suspects, because the low lives' Gestapo is everywhere! Even worse: In the film they abuse the Mexican minority in the southern rim of the US for suspect of being aliens, for example in the famous truck-scene where the two MIB search the trunk and find these aliens disguised as Mexicans. So, the message of this movie is clear enough: The few Mexicans in the trunk are the real Americans, while the majority around, the alleged Americans, are the aliens.

What a classic,"It was the year 1997, and the greatest agent the world has ever known was planning to retire and he needed to acquire and train his replacement. Who best to fit his shoes than Agent Jay (Will Smith).This movie made us understand why strange things and strange people roam around, with a solid plot that keeps you guessing ""where is the galaxy?"" ""If it is here on earth and it is meant to be millions of stars where on earth could you hide that?"" Leave it to the men in black, they not only found the galaxy and save the world from the Arquillians who were going to vaporize the whole planet earth to stop the bugs from getting the galaxy.I loved this movie in 1997 and I still love it now, listening to the soundtrack, doing the moves... all brings back fun memories of my youth. But the point am trying to make is, what makes a movie great is the ability to stand the test of time, no matter when you watch it be it 15 years after its initial release it will always be a classic.Directed by Barry Sonnenfeld, who did a great job directing the screenplay and story done by Ed Solomon comes this well put together movie flick that mixes comedy with fantasy and a lot of action.Comparing this to its part 2 will be an unfair comparison, why? Because Men In Black 2 lacked the action and comedy to keep you watching, something Men In Black one had a lot of. I have to give kudos to the graphics it is far better than what I saw in Men In Black 2, also the screenplay is masterful each scene had enough happenings to keep you hoping the scene will drag longer.The producers are planning a Men In Black 3, something I hope will be better than 2, the Men In Black 3 coming out in May 2012 will be taking in a huge budget of over 200 Million dollars in production, something I hope will be put to good use.The Men In Black movie, led to the creation of the MIB animation series that span 4 seasons of 53 episodes. What can I say, but the franchise is a goldmine, one which the producers want to dig till there is nothing left.All in all, go see this movie whether you have seen it before or not.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy"
Here come the Men In Black.,"'Men In Black (1997)' is a fast-paced, sort of 'old-school' buddy-cop caper by way of a science-fiction action-comedy, a nineties classic that's propelled by two charismatic lead performances - alongside several entertainingly scene-chewing supporting ones - and some incredibly quotable set-pieces. It's ultimately a movie driven by its well-rounded, likeable central characters and their relationship, though it doesn't spare on the wonderfully practical spectacle, either. While the story is simple, it's certainly effective and highly entertaining right the way through, not to mention properly funny at points. This makes for an enjoyable movie that knows exactly how seriously to take itself. It's wholly focused on giving its audience as good a time as possible. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy"

Fresh and cool!,"(8 out of 10)  'Men in Black' is a too-cool-for-you science fiction epic! Based upon a cult comic book, it presents aliens as real (as real as Tony Robbins!), and the government as secretive as some of our paranoid citizens think they are.The movie keeps pulling surprises out of its bag of tricks, from regrowing alien heads to a giant cockroach alien!  And it does so with a good plot with a funny twist end!Smith and Jones are a great team.  Most movie buddy movies where they pit opposite types against each other fail because it's so obvious.  This works because Smith and Jones are so damn cool!  They seem to be trying to outdo each other with their coolness, and we get to benefit.  Best of all, we CARE about these two lead characters, how they got where they are, and what happens to them.  In science fiction films, often the effects overwhelm the characters, but not here.I absolutely LOVE Vincent D'Onofrio in this!  When I watch him on Law and Order, sometimes he says things a bit like the alien in this movie!The special effects are great, the storyline is fascinating, the jokes are great, and the cast is perfect!

"entertaining in all the right ways, with great practical effects and an extremely cool concept, especially for teenagers","I'm giving this a 10 for a few reasons, one of which might be biased, and that's nostalgia: I originally saw this when I was 13 and I looooved it. The humor is clever at times but mostly just silly, and even now, 17 years later, I still love it. The script is pretty wittily written, and fit the dichotomy of the contrasting characters so well; Will Smith is highly entertaining, but so is Tommy Lee Jones, who I've loved in more serious roles, but even in this he delivers a memorable performance and an irreplaceable character, as the movie grew into a series (I really liked the sequel; didn't care for the third, though). And then there's the action, I mean, it isn't a guns blazing movie per se, but the practical effects especially with ""Edgar"" are so impressive at times it's quite disturbing, and in some scenes they really did push that PG-13 rating. I also really liked that the ""love interest"" wasn't consistent, so the movie was never bogged down by any cliché romances. Pacing and runtime are tight and to the point; the movie never seems to lull and even at the end there is a catchy Will Smith song which, say what you may, I to this day enjoy.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy"
Dark fun.,"From the director of ""Addams Family"" and ""Addams Family Values,"" comes a dark comedy/sci-fi featuring two of America's most loved actors.This movie is anything but a let down. The intelligent darkly comedic aspects of this movie are both clever and witty. While the science in this movie is a little lacking, the action and comedic elements are highly effective.I found the performances to be solid and well-delivered. Tommy Lee Jones could not give a bad performance, even if his director was Mick Garris! It simply is not IN him to do so. Will Smith...well, I'm not really a fan of Mr. Smith. In my opinion, he is the single-most over-rated, ego-inflated figure in the industry. I'm neither a fan of his work, nor his over-inflated pay checks. That not withstanding, his performance in this movie was quite good, and even I could enjoy it.The direction was wonderful, the creativity of the aliens was imaginative and astounding, and the plot was quite inspired.We found the finished product to be an instant and welcome addition to our ""comic book"" collection.PLOT: A new ""bug"" has come to town, and it's terrorizing Manhattan in a brand new Edgar suit. It is up to K and his unseasoned partner J to determine why he is here on Earth, and to foil his evil plan.It sounds far more campy than it is. The superior direction and ultimate polished execution never allowed this work to cross that line. And while it is delivered with tongue-in-cheek humor, the darker aspects cloak the levity in a fine darkling gossamer shroud.I highly enjoy this production, from all angles of a critical eye.It rates an 8.4/10 from...the Fiend :.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy"

There was absolutely no chemistry between Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith, they were never funny. The story (plot) was so very thin and very very bad.

Show love to the black suit.,"What if there was a special government department whose job it was to police extra-terrestrials secretly living among us? How would new agents be recruited? What kind of technology would be available to them? How would they keep their existence secret? These questions and more are answered in director Barry Sonnenfeld's ingenious blockbuster comedy/sci-fi/actioner Men In Black.The plot—agents Jay and Kay (Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones) must locate a nasty alien bug that threatens the future of planet Earth— isn't quite as strong as the film's basic premise, but with an excellent cast, superb special effects, and plenty of inventiveness, Men In Black has more than enough going for it to make it a great way to spend 98 minutes. Leads Smith and Jones share excellent on-screen chemistry, FX genius Rick Baker provides some incredible alien designs, Linda Fiorentino is easy on the eye as an NY coroner who discovers the truth, and there's a really hilarious talking pug called Frank.

There couldn't be a better match for alien exterminators.Vincent D'Onfrio is so hilarious and creepy as the alien threatening the safety of Earth. His performance is really great.It's serious moments are even more effective than its comedic ones because they are so well-written and there aren't too many of them. Ed Solomon knew exactly what he was doing when he wrote the script and couldn't have done a better job.The plot itself is timed and explained really well. The two MIB agents are working together to solve a mystery surrounding the ferocious bug. It isn't very complicated but not so simplistic either.Almost everything works in the film. But I do have to stress ""almost"". The attraction type thing going on between Will Smith and Linda what's-her-last-name is a bore, but is only brief. Plus, some scenes seem to be more filler than actual plot (Will Smith delivering a baby alien), but the movie still never loses steam. 7.9/10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy"
Peak Will Smith,"Men in Black is peak Will Smith. The story is compelling, the style is thorough, and the filmmaking is strong. Smith is an ideal everyman with charm, Jones is an excellent dry counterpart, and D'Onofrio steals the show with his physical acting. Meanwhile, the production design is flawlessly balanced. Men in Black is sleek, mysterious, creepy, and supernatural. This easily could've clashed and felt cheesy, inauthentic, or downright lame (like the sequels). Instead, Men in Black is timeless because its look is a home run.Contributing to that look are the special effects, which unites CGI and practical effects. CGI aliens hold real prosthetics, real puppets have computer enhancements, and monsters switch between graphic and practical depending on the shot. This fusion synergizes the effects and stabilizes the movie between cartoonish and relatable. From there, the sound design is complex, the editing is energized, and the cinematography is potent (specifically, The Bug's landing is prime storytelling). Finally, Danny Elfman's score ties Men in Black together with an eerie yet playful tone that suits the film perfectly. All together, Men in Black is an entertaining ride that truly has it all. Even after all these years, it's a movie for everyone.Writing: 7/10

Last thing I knew - flash of light!,"When the movie first came out - I was skeptical. I didn't think it would hold up to its own; especially a complete comedian/rapper like Will Smith.Will Smith plays as a very cocksure police officer with quite the wit. When he chases down a perpetrator that eventually partially reveals itself to him as an alien, the soon-to-be Agent J just dismisses it as a possible medical issue. Tommy Lee Jones plays the perfect part for this movie - really reminds me of a person former-military type that has his act together and just knows how to de-escalate a situation at any cost, and knows his job inside and out very meticulously. He is also the tragic hero in this series (by this series, I mean the first 3 MIBs). Agent K has a very ""take no BS dry wit"" personality - something I can relate to!It is a great movie that really pretty much gives the moral of the story to ""There's always more to the story than we know"", or ""Always keep an open mind - the possibilities are endless"".Even if you're the non-believer in the UFO phenomena - it is stil a movie that I would recommend to watch!

Great Sci-Fi Comedy,"Mixing Science Fiction with comedy is a risky proposition, unless the film in question is a sendup of Sci-Fi films (I still can't decide if ""Mars Attacks"" was worth the matinée price I paid to see it almost a decade ago). ""Men in Black"", however, is a near perfect blend of Science Fiction and comedy. Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones are two of the most watchable actors out there, and the pairing of the two in this film is ingenious. The supporting cast,from Linda Fiorentino to Tony Shaloub, is top notch. The special effects, from the dragonfly flight during the opening credits to the spaceship crash near the finale are excellent. The writing is also much more clever than one might expect from a Sci-Fi picture - the film has to be viewed several times to catch all the barbs and asides Smith and Lee throw at each other.

Together, the two of them must track down an intergalactic terrorist hiding in a human body (Vincent D'Onofrio).Yeah, it sounds really stupid.  And technically, it is, and also completely implausible.  But so what?  This is the kind of movie you need after a 40 hour week of work to relax.  You can just watch it and not think about anything else.  These types really aren't very deep and from a critical standpoint severely lacking in the script department, but they're fun and you can actually watch it with your kids without being embarassed.Jones and Smith totally own this movie.  It's rare to see two guys who can work so well together.  And Vincent D'Onofrio steals every scene he's in as the towering zombie-like creature.  Linda Fiorentino also rocks as Dr. Weaver.

And, it's such fun to watch fifty-something Tommy Lee show twenty-something Will a thing or two. The definitive movie for the end of this millennium. As Tommy Lee says, ""A person is smart; people are dumb.""",,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy"
One of the best science fiction films in recent years,"I found this movie to be very highly enjoyable and very well worth the time spent watching it.  It has a lot of good, edge of your seat action, splendid special effects and terrific laughs throughout.  I also think that Will Smith & Tommy Lee Jones work so very well together.  If you're a fan of science fiction and you, by chance, still haven't seen this movie, I really think you ought to give this one a try.  You're in for a real treat if you do.",,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy"
Surprisingly enjoyable,"I delayed from watching this movie for a LONG time.  I've never been a Will Smith fan, and I'd been put off by the hype.  I basically caught it on HBO when I had nothing better to do and was pleasantly surprised.It's just a really fun movie.  I like SFX films like this that present something close to reality, but just twist it a little bit to give us something a bit perculiar.  Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones make the perfect pair, it's easily Smith's best vehicle yet.  Right before his ego got TOO big.  Linda Fiorentino makes the most of her role too.The visual effects are original and fun, and the story has enough momentum and impact to keep you interested for it's length, but at the same time doesn't take itself seriously at all. Men in Black is one of the few big budget Hollywood movies that I'd actually look forward to a sequel from.7/10",,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy"
Very good film!,I saw this film last night while my mom watched her movie Manhunter. The movie begins with a bug getting into a truck then a Sheriff asks to check his truck. The sheriff gets slimed by an alien. Then ther'e was an alien in a dead man's body. All the agents have a locker. An alien spit on Agent J. Then the alien's get arrested at the end. Then a man turns into an alien when an alien takes his body.,,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy"
AWESOME SCI-FI COMEDY,"Men in Black is such an awesome movie I did not think I would enjoy it to the extent that I did. In many ways, Men in Black is the movie that Mars Attacks! wanted to be, but wasn't. This is a snappy, clever, often-funny motion picture that provides the perfect blend of science fiction-style action with comic dialogue. The screenplay, credited to Ed Solomon (and based on the Marvel comic book by Lowell Cunningham) has a sly, sophisticated edge that many blockbuster scripts lack. Sonnenfeld's direction is crisp and the editing is tight, resulting in a film that clocks in at a mere ninety-five minutes, which proves to be a nearly-perfect length. Both Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith make a fantastic duo and all the other actors(especially Vincent D'Onofrio) are spot on. This is a must watch film even if you don't really fancy comedy or science fiction films.",,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy"
Good movie,"I did say good movie, I wouldn't say ""great"" movie. I always thought this film was slightly overrated in 1997. It is however quite an enjoyable way to spend ninety minutes, Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones make a good pairing and the special effects are great. There are more original ideas in this film than most summer blockbusters and it reminded me of one of my all time favourite films ""Ghostbusters"". I don't think I'll bother with the follow up judging by the reviews. No surprise there though sequels rarely match the original do they?",,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy"
Great blend of science fiction and comedy,"I first saw this movie when my family and I went to our local theatre.  I thought it was pretty good, but it was very weird.  After that, I borrowed it from my grandma, who doesn't really care much for it.  What's kind of ironic is that there is a cat in that movie that looks just like one of the cats that lives at my grandma's barn.  This movie has good acting by Wil Smith (who also acted in the sitcom ""Fresh Prince of Bel Aire"") and Tommy Lee Jones.",,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy"
Overrated? I don't think so.,"How can anyone call this film overrated? That's a title you would have to give to Titanic, but certainly not MIB. The story line is something similar to the X-Files, but with a more comedic twist. There are also very impressive special effects. The actors have great chemistry together, especially Smith and Jones. MIB is one of the best films ever.",,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy"
Entertaining performances in energetic Sci-Fi adventure,"Despite not being a big fan of the Sci-Fi genre I did find this 1997 hit very enjoyable.One of Will Smith's earlier films shows him star alongside renowned actor Tommy Lee Jones as a pair of secret agents who are on a chase of a dangerous alien.The simplicity behind the story is fantastic with Smith being recruited into the service and dealing with all new situations to him.Combining the Sci-Fi genre with comedic elements makes this film what it is and differs from other original adventures such as E.T. The graphics to construct the aliens and MIB headquarters are great and fully sufficient to justify the genre.Smith and Jones form a great partnership as the alien detecting duo. Jones' serious tone is juxtaposed with Smith's laid back ass kicking attitude, giving the audience different aspects of characters and therefore a more in-depth coverage of the business they are involved in. Both actors are acting their hearts out and are both serious as well as funny.Through cohesion are we able to see how well this short story links together. Perhaps the film was too short but all of the many story lines combine together to add to an energetic plot involving mystery inside the lives of aliens, agents, and normal people who are humorously zapped with the nurolizer, an ingenious invention, greatly used throughout.One of the main reasons I was able to appreciate the ideologies of this film was through the sense of mystery. Jones is a veteran in the business and Smith is just coming in, therefore the audience is taken through step by step of new aspects through Smith learning all about the world we really live in.It's different and energetic throughout with director Barry Sonnenfeld leading an all star cast through their paces and will keep audiences hooked throughout.This film is a must watch but don't bother with the sequel which fails miserably at every corner and cannot match up to the sheer brilliant physical and talking humour in this with its energetic mysterious storylineA great film for Sci-Fi fans and also for the whole family",,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy"
Twisted Sci-Fi movie,"Men In Black is about a secret angency, that knows one thing that others don't, there are aliens in the world. So then Will Smith becomes part of the angency, and Agent K (Tommy Lee Jones), and agent J (Smith) fight off the aliens.Good movie has Smith and Jones in good roles. Smart, usually funny, and has some creative moments here and there. Great special effects all the way.***",,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy"
"No, this ain't a documentary based on the life of Johnny Cash!","Will Smith makes a funny and dynamic performance as he onceagain battles aliens in the 1997 monster hit ""Men in Black.""Like in ""Independence Day"" in '96, Smith plays a wisecrackinghero that likes to ""whup E.T.'s a**"". Unlike ""ID4,"" where heplays a jet pilot, Smith plays a streetwise New York cop namedJames who is recruited by a mysterious government agency thatinvestigates and monitors all galactic alien activities here onEarth. That agency is called The Men in Black, or MIB for short.Tommy Lee Jones also shines as the methodical agent Kay, whoguides James into the life and work of a Man in Black.With silly science fiction effects and a good, humorouschemistry between Jones and Smith, ""Men in Black"" is a greatfilm to watch it's perfect for all ages to view. With only veryfew profanity and perfectly tame violence, parents wouldn't needto worry about any bad influence spread to their kids. Thelittle ones would love the wacky aliens. Plus, after the movie,Will Smith's music video is sure to deligh",,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy"
Science fiction comedy at its best,"Men in Black works on a few factors- a well plotted storyline and the chemistry between Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones. Men in Black are a secret organization which monitor extra-terrestrial activities on Earth. When an alien being starts creating havoc in New York our two leads act to rid of it. Linda Fiorentino is sassy as the sole female presence here and it is strange to see her career fizzle out the way it did. Vincent D O'nofrio is excellent as the human host of the alien. Men in Black is a breezy affair, funny and the kind of film Hollywood should make more often yet does not. The special effects are good such that they assist the story and not just exist to provide pyro technique eye candy.",,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy"

"A better ""Dragnet"" comedy than ""Dragnet"" was","The extravagantly drawn, authentically motivated minor characters and the occasional reminders of job-induced loneliness made this a better ""Dragnet"" comedy than the Dan Ackroyd version was.  The makers of MIB knew what to laugh at and what to leave real. I was particularly impressed at the ending; for once, we don't go straight from the closing duel to the closing credits.I'm sure that not just the special-effects guys but also Vincent D'Onofrio deserves a lot of credit for his somehow moving around like a badly-disguised cockroach.  I suppose that with challenges like that to address, no one noticed that Rip Torn's beard didn't seem to belong to him...",,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy"
'Black' is as good as gold,"*** 1/2Starring: Will Smith, Tommy Lee Jones, Vincent D'Onforio, and Linda Fiorentino.A man gets recruited by a mysterious person wearing all black to become an investigator of alien activities.

I recommend it.",,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy"
lots of fun with great casting,"Jones is a seasoned veteran of the top secret, tech-savvy government agency that monitors all extraterrestrial life on Earth and throughout the universe without our knowledge; Smith is the brash, smart-mouthed new recruit who joins him in keeping the peace between human beings and ""resident aliens,"" until circumstances force them to try and thwart an infamously violent alien whose very presence threatens the entire planet. Wacky, laugh-out loud funny take on the alien invasion saga is slickly plotted, with clever ideas and nifty special effects. The combination of Smith's impulsive rookie and Jones' stiff veteran works to perfection, and the two leads have plenty of fine comedic moments. ***",,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy"
I was expecting something else.,"Here I thought Men In Black would be a serious look into all the UFOology, the cover-ups, the abductions, Area 51, you know, X-Files kind of stuff. Instead, we get what is nothing more than a Saturday morning cartoon. Oh, it was entertaining all right, with some funny scenes, and goofy aliens, but it was too much like Ghostbusters or even Independence Day in its lightweightedness. It was like eating cotton candy when I wanted a steak.",,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy"
A funny surprise,"This movie is a lot better than I had expected. I thought it would be sci-fi and not a comedy. I decided to take a chance with it anyway, when it was on a Scandinavian movie channel, and I was surprised. It is really funny. I did not particularly like Tommy Lee Jones in ""The fugitive"" or ""Under Siege"", in this, however, he performs well. Will Smith is a great comedian, although his style is the same he has used before.",,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy"
"Now Mr.SMITH is cool, but what about Mr. JONES ?","I´ve seen MIB and I found it quiet cool. Will SMITH cool as always but Tommy Lee JONES is quite cooler overall. The Alien Animations, especially the ones of the big bug were really astonishing. I really look forward seeing the sequel of it. The song MIB is only performed at the end of the movie, that´s a little bit sad, cause I like hip-hop very much, they could have put it somewhere in the middle of it, too. But check it out, a flick you must not miss.",,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy"
An enjoyable Sci-Fi romp that is over all too soon,"It's amazing how simple it is to make a really good comedy without having to try too hard with a busy script.Men In Black is just such a comedy, played very firmly with tongue-in-cheek and not to be taken at all seriously. The story is simple yet  very rich & entertaining (although it also received a lot of bad press from some quarters because it was seen as racist - an allegory for repatriating illegal immigrants from the US!)The two lead stars, Smith & Jones, don't have to stretch themselves too much, acting wise, since they're both on familiar ground, especially from wise-cracking Will Smith who was really only continuing his character mannerisms from where Independence Day left off.I was quite surprised with TLJ, I've never really thought of him as being the comedy-film-type, but he plays his role with a great deal of mellowed drollery, not letting Smith's antics wind him up too much, which is typical of most buddy partnerships in comedy movies (Lethal Weapon, Beverly Hills Cop, 48 Hours etc)The support from Rip Torn & Vincent D'onofrio was good but patchy, they weren't given enough material from the script to make us really care for them. Similarly with Linda Fioretino, she is a very attractive lady but wasn't really allowed to have enough dialogue to make us appreciate her more. She would have made a good foil/romantic link for Smith, but this was never allowed to even develop, just like the character she portrayed.The CGI sfx, although not particularly overwhelming were generally quite good, and the music really helped pace the film and I loved the upbeat & funky Will Smith music video clip straight after the movie.I enjoyed MIB far more than the over-rated, over-hyped IE4. The only problem was that it only lasts about 90 minutes, which is quite short for a Hollywood movie these days where most stretch to at least two hours.I hope the original cast & main characters are brought together again for the impending sequel. There's plenty of material to go round and perhaps on this occasion more attention can be paid to a more indepth characterisation of both K & J (and hopefully  Linda too), because we hardly get to know anything about these dudes from this movie.***/*****",,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy"
Worth Seeing...,"Men In Black is an excellent film, if only for its subtle exploration of our society's paranoid alien folklore.  Every conceived alien conspiracy theory is covered (with the exception of crop designs) and handled creatively, often tying into several neighboring conspiracy theories.  For years, America has murmured quietly about UFO/FBI cover-ups, alien life and the mysterious `Men In Black' who show up asking questions after every unnatural phenomenon  finally Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones give us the answers!An action-comedy, Men In Black accosts the highly-funded yet unofficial government agency, Division 6, headed by Zed (Rip Torn).  There Agents K (Jones) and J (Smith) keep tabs on the sizable alien population of the US and investigate and regulate all alien entities that enter the planet's NYC port, many of which are completely harmless.  Apparently, aliens have lived among us for some time (a wall chart shows a picture of every alien on Earth  among them: Sylvester Stallone, Newt Gingrich and Dionne Warwick). Anyway, while on the job, the MIB agents uncover the deadly plot of an intergalactic terrorist named Edgar (Vincent D' Onofrio) who's on a mission to assassinate two ambassadors from opposing galaxies currently residing in New York City.  Thus, in order to prevent imminent doom, K and J must track down the terrorist.Director Barry Sonnenfeld (The Addams Family and its sequel) isn't over-excessive with special-effects, chase-scenes or unnecessary explosions  in fact, everything is skillfully placed for a purpose (what a concept!). As aforementioned, the film plays with some pretty ridiculous notions, producing some wicked little witticism (tabloid newspapers are the best source of reporting as far as Jones' character is concerned, while the exhibit at the 1964 World's Fair was nothing more than a flying saucer cover-up).Just remember, reality is often times more weirder that science fiction  Men In Black inclines viewers to side with the conspiracy version of history in a most entertaining way.  Frighteningly enough, some of the scenarios and theories presented in the film can actually be backed up by facts, which could prove a bit much for those already a bit unhinged.  I say see it!",,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy"
Actually gets better,"This movie has one amazing thing going for it that very few other films of its genre can boast - subtlety. Sly humour, gentle pathos, sight gags slightly off centre screen, and the unusual and exciting sexiness of Linda Fiorentino make it a winner the second time around.",,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy"
A good rest before the new Bruce Willis movie.,"After long pathetic stories of love saving the Universe Men in Black is very refreshing. Nothing serious (almost), no detailed human psychology research, no final 30-minute fight between the good and the bad guys. It is a good rest before the new Bruce Willis movie.",,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy"
Thrill ride for the masses,"Who cares about a plot??  The plot is the only thing that actually slows this joyride down a bit halfway through.  MiB is laugh aloud funny, packed with whiz-bang one-liners, pokes at everyone from Elvis to Newt Gingrich, and much charm from the stars, Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith. Smith is extremely enjoyable as the New Guy, employed to help save Earth from aliens, all in a day's work. His swaggering confidence and sass are an amusing contrast to Jone's delightfully deadpanned agent K.The wise-cracking humor here is great, as evidenced in one of my favorite exchanges:  Jones claims to be from the FBI and asks a woman to discuss her husband's transformation into an alien. The wife sullenly retorts, ""Is this some kinda joke?"" TO which Jones solemnly replies, ""No, ma'am, we at the FBI do not have a sense of humor we are aware of.""",,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy"

Funny and hilariously silly flick..,"I loved this movie when I first saw it in the theater two years ago. I loved it so much that I bought it.

They made me watch it!,"I am not a Will Smith fan largely because I though he was constantly over-perpetuating an image on his ""Fresh Prince"" show.I would never have gone to see MIB on my own if my buddy  hadn't made me watch it on VHS [I'd rather watch Benny Hill anyday].MIB,however totally blew me away solely by it's special effects.I stll think Smith overdoes everything,but Jones,Fiorentino and Torn really deliver some great roles and superb characters.The only thing I didn't like is how the bug[played by my man Vincent D'Onofrio]seemed to flip-flop between being so dangerous and then so child-like [when he teases the wife or plays with the bell].Why does it calmly deliver a lunch order then go nuts looking for where the  dead go ? This makes as about much sense as a Klingon knowing on how to go through the McDonalds drive through and then asking for a keh-plar.Nevertheles,I'm looking forward to the next sequel,but I would like the MIB to meet their match.......ghosts and vampires.",,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy"
I HEAR YOU WILL SMITH,SciFi will never be the same once you put Will Smith at the helm. Both he and Tommy Lee Jones did very well together playing the duo who stop criminals of the 3rd kind. Having Smith's character go beyond the norm on fighting crime is a special privilege for him. The video was a big topper at the end. That's what made it best. A 10!,,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy"
Fun to watch,"I love this movie! It's one of the best Will Smith films. It has some funny lines and good, clean humor. One of the funniest parts to me was when the MIB pulled Reggie and his wife over and Tommy Lee Jones was asking him to see his *other* license and registration and Reggie's wife was having a baby and Will had to deliver it and the ""baby"" wrapped itself around Will and was banging him down on top of the car and everything. I thought that part was hilarious. I also liked Edgar and the way he walked and ran into things. I loved the part where he comes back  inside the house just after the bug stole his body and his wife says ""Edgar you're skin is hanging off your bones"" and he looks in the mirror and he says ""oh, yeah,"" and he pulls his skin back on his face and he says ""there, is that better!"" and his wife passes out!!! Most people think that movies have to have jokes about sex and violence to have a good humorous movie but this movie doesn't and it's still worth watching. I bought the sequel a couple of days ago and I still have yet to watch it! I hope it's as good as the first one. Anyways. Men In Black is a great family movie and it deserves good comments. Talk to you later. Tootles!! Thanks for reading my review!!",,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy"
