I think 'D'oh' sums this film up nicely,"Unfortunately i did not think the movie lived up to the hype. probably the most successful TV series/cartoon ever made, but not one of the greatest movies. I did think before watching the movie that the writers would struggle to find the perfect storyline to ice the proverbial cake that they have spent so many years 'baking', and they did. not the most original story line in history with some very random plot twists, and some very out of character decisions. A lot of the gags played on previous jokes from the TV show, which being a watcher i understood, but didn't find all that funny, but left the first timer guessing a bit. the movie as a whole had a surrealism about it, as though it had not been written by the same people who had previously provided me with hours of entertainment. very predictable in places, but awkwardly random in others. i must say i did find parts of the movie funny, and didn't wish i hadn't seen it, but that does not save the film. i feel this film has come 5 years too late, they should have made it in the shows prime.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
I'm so glad it didn't suck!!!,"Let me just say I had my doubts. The last couple of seasons of 'The Simpsons' have been lackluster at best and I genuinely thought that their chance to make a great Simpsons film passed roughly 10 years ago. BOY WAS I WRONG!!! I am a huge Simpsons nerd and it is my privilege to say that ""The Simpsons Movie"" belongs in the very small group of classic Simpsons episodes (""Bart the Daredevil"", ""Mr. Plow"", etc.) Very funny and very timely. Great animation and some nice cameos.Really don't want to give any spoilers so I'll just say if you're a Simpsons fan: you will love this movie. And if you agree that the Simpsons lost their edge, you will be pleasantly surprised as was I. 8.5/10",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
I don't know....I just don't know.,"Just got out of the theater. Don't get me wrong, I was entertained throughout the duration of the film. But I rarely got any belly laughs out of it. And I just wanted it to be...well, smarter and funnier.The animation and production values are awesome. Just seeing Springfield and all the characters on the big screen is enough to make this movie worth going to. But I was rather let down in terms of the comedy. It seemed like it was dumbed down to give it more mass appeal and that's disappointing. I also had annoying little kids sitting around me and their father refused to shut them up...which somewhat ruined the experience. The first 45 min are good, then it dips in humor.In conclusion, while the South Park movie took advantage of the new medium by pushing the envelope and producing hilarious, brilliant satire...The Simpsons Movie seems to do the opposite, getting watered down in the process.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
I laughed... but I should've laughed harder and more frequently.,"In this big-screen adventure featuring the lovable folk of Springfield, trouble brews for the Simpson family after Homer irresponsibly pollutes the local water supply with tons of pig manure. As a result of this thoughtless action, the town is encased in a huge dome by the Environment Protection Agency and, after angry Springfield citizens form a lynch mob, Homer and his family are forced to become fugitives.How much you enjoy The Simpsons Movie will depend entirely on your opinion of the current Simpsons TV show: if you have loved the past few seasons, then you'll have a great timethe movie is as funny, if not slightly better, than your average episode of recent years. Those of us, however, who recognise that the show has long since passed its prime will feel underwhelmed: the movie is often amusing, but very rarely hilarious.And that's just not good enough! When a series as successful as The Simpsons takes 20 years to make the leap from the small screen to the big screen, it had better be damn goodnay, it had better be exceptional!! Instead, this rather uninspired product just doesn't make the wait worthwhile.5 out of 10, bumped up to 6 out of a misguided sense of loyalty to a show that has given me so much fun in the past.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
The long overdue simpsons movie is a hilarious and witty piece of entertainment,"The simpsons movie is witty,fast paced, touching, hugely entertaining and most importantly: laugh out loud funny.And if your a simpsons fan who's loved every episode , thats all you'll need from it.However if , like me , your an obsessive fan who's noticed a drop in quality on the show from the late nineties onwards you'll see some problems. You'll see that structure wise the movie is basically an extended episode.You'll notice that the villain is a Hank Scorpio rip off. You'll feel that a lot of the plot points and character drama seem all too familiar.But in spite of all this , in spite of being a film based on a show that exhausted its best gags long ago, the simpsons movie is still absolutely hilarious and i take my hat off to the creators for managing to make it so.A simpsons movie in the early nineties (when the show was in its prime) would have been better, but the very , very , very funny one we have here in '07 works just fine. Funny stuff.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
A Homer with Bases Loaded.,"Just about everything I could have hoped for from a Simpsons movie including the heart the show has been lacking for several seasons now. If you like the easy breathing pace of the early years of The Simpsons you'll find a lot to like in the movie. The gags are leisurely and natural and even when they fail (Comic Book Guy comes to mind), another drops in to pick up the laugh. What's most surprising, in addition to a much needed return to consistent characters, is that the movie manages to balance the plot and the gags with near perfection. Regardless what you may think going in, it does feel like a ""real"" movie from beginning to end and not just an extended show. Albert Brooks once again steals the show as the Director of the EPA, though Tom Hanks does the best celebrity cameo the show has seen in ages. ""tousle my hair Mr. Hanks!""",,Anonymous,Animation
Just okay,"There was a time when ""The Simpsons"" stood for the funniest, most original comedy on the planet. Somewhere around season 8 the show passed its prime, though, and since then it varies from good to okay and sometimes even insipid. I was hoping that for the movie the writers would really push themselves and come up with some really clever and new ideas one more time, but for all the years of developing that supposedly went into this, the movie seems like nothing more than an extended TV episode of latter day ""Simpsons"".I have to admit that I'm not really convinced of the concept of putting an animated TV series on the big screen in the first place. Even the ""South Park"" movie that tried to incorporate theatrical elements such as the musical numbers didn't really justify the need for a cinematic adventure. Most animated comedy shows have a very fast paced humor with quick editing. This works for an episode of 25-30 minutes, but in a movie with 90 minutes running time it would become too exhausting for the audience. Therefore the whole thing has to be slowed down, which in return takes away a lot of the show's comedic appeal. It's a lose-lose situation as they say.As a consequence ""The Simpsons Movie"" is unusually slow at times. At the same time the storyline is not really stretched to cinematic proportions. Epic as it may be, similar topics have already been dealt with in the TV show (and better). It's been said before and it's true: nothing here tries to push any boundaries and except for the length of the whole thing (and maybe some annoying people in the theater who watch the movie with you) you would never realize that this is a ""Simpsons""-motion picture.Other flaws include the fact that some inhabitants of Springfield have only very brief cameos (Mr. Burns!) and that some ideas have been used in a fairly similar way before. As entertaining as the movie still may be, it is also pretty predictable at times. This kind of ""underachieving"", as some critic called it, may have its own charm, but in the end one would have hoped for this to be a bit more special. The movie is by no means a catastrophe, but by ""Simpsons""-standards it's just not good enough.""The Simpsons"" have become a brand. People know what to expect and therefore applaud even a relatively average movie like this one. To rely on that is a bit lazy, however, and one wishes that producers put an end to Homer's adventures as long as we can still remember him and the other beloved inhabitants of Springfield as characters that completely revolutionized comedy at one point and not as money making merchandising props.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
"fear not folks, it is very funny","what more can I say. the movie is a return to the glory days of the show, those ever yellow times when Homer jumped the gorge, when alien ants threatened the earth and the mono rail came to town. If any of that made sense to you then this is the film to go for this weekend. It is a laugh a minute, unlike most comedy films which seem to think funny is a dirty word. I have to say it is NOT really a kids film (although a child sitting near me was crying with laughter) as some of the lines are very naughty and near the bone. I am keen to see it again to catch all the gags I missed. And thank God Ricky Gervais was not allowed anywhere near it (his TV episode stunk!). So if you're up to you knees in flood water or suffering from some other global disaster right now and fancy a good time your local multiplex is the place to go. Lets face it we all need a laugh right now.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
"An incendiary, hilarious, and ultimately anticlimactic ride","For all the creativity crammed into one half-hour episode of ""The Simpsons,"" I am probably not alone in saying that the show's creative apex bottomed out when it stopped being a ""funny sitcom"" and became a ""cultural phenomenon""--it's been years since I've sat in front of the TV on a Sunday night with the primary interest of being wowed by Matt Groening's brainchild. When the show first began in 1989, the Bart-friendly T-shirts and pins seemed borne out of uncertainty over the show's staying power; these days, with the show's position in the TV canon firmly established, your Xbox games are designed for little more than feeding the ""Simpsons"" cash cow. That being said, I revisit the show every once in a while (via taped weekday-afternoon reruns of earlier seasons), and very much appreciate it--the sense of satire is sly, incendiary, and often very funny. Some critics cite horror films as being able to express social concerns that would be difficult to convey in other genres; ""The Simpsons"" would be another arena (and easily the more critically acclaimed).So, after years of hype, this cultural phenomenon has spawned a film (aptly titled ""The Simpsons Movie"") that most fans will no doubt consider 'belated.' As a laid-back viewer with an appreciation of the show, the end result is frequently ""LOL"" hilarious, but not very endearing (honestly, I had forgotten most of the gags by the time I was out of the theater and walking to my car). The best I can say is, ""it's like a really good episode of the TV show"" rather than ""a great film,"" though I guess that's complimentary enough. I will pick up the DVD once it's released, and be reminded all over of why the film succeeded in its primary goal of clever laughs.It begins with an excellent jab at the film's own existence, courtesy of Homer (""Why pay for something we can watch on TV for free?"" indeed!), then delves into a plot that is as incendiary as anything the yellow-tinged family has tackled: an environmental crisis strikes Springfield when Homer dumps a silo a pig feces in a lake that's been recently de-contaminated, inspiring outrage from the citizens and the government (headed by President Schwarzenegger, though I kept thinking ""President McBain""), whose EPA liaison (voiced by Albert Brooks, who also guest-voiced the similar ""Hal Scorpio"" years ago) covers the contaminated city in a huge Plexiglas dome. Before you can say ""Al Gore eats yellow snow,"" the Simpsons escape through a literal sinkhole and make tracks for Alaska as renegades from the law, only to find themselves returning to rescue their idyllic American home.Which ultimately isn't much different than what you would find in an average episode of ""The Simpsons."" This is a film that knows its audience, but also successfully provides an initiation for those who (for some strange reason) have never seen the show. The animation is fluid, colorful, and uber-glossy, and the writing is on par with the better episodes (the mantra remains ""anything goes"" in ""Simpson""-world); some intriguing character twists aside, the film overall neither exceeds nor diminishes the expectations of those who expect everything and those who expect nothing. It's a fun summer film, but not an outstanding blockbuster of endearing quality...you'll laugh heartily and maybe feel moved, but the relatively short running time is both a blessing and a curse--while you will be sufficiently guffawed-out by the end credits, ""The Simpsons Movie"" leaves a viewer yearning for more. I suppose that's as good an indication as any to go back to the tapes.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
The Simpsons Movie was Worth the Wait. Fantastic!,"I Don't want to give much away, but this movie truly is EPIC. The storyline is great, so is the animation. The movie is hilarious throughout, and also has one of the most emotional moments ever on The Simpsons. You can see just about every face ever on The Simpsons and they keep making subtle references, such as when Homer and Bart jump Springfield Gorge, the ambulance is still crashed into the tree.It definitely rewards long-time fans, but it is a great movie even for those who don't watch the Simpsons. CGI only adds to the excellent drawings, and it is very cool to see them on the big screen!If you love the Simpsons, Old or New, you will LOVE this.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Best Simpsons episode of my life......so far.,"I was dreading this. The series has been faltering for at least five seasons so far and it is obvious they were running out of jokes. Well it seems they have saved quite a few for this comic masterpiece. The Simpsons movie manages to pack in a gag rate that is comparable to ""Airplane"" but also manages to tell an entertaining story that goes beyond the confines of the usual 22 minutes we are used to. I will not reveal the plot as future generations will enjoy this movie but I have read a comment that compares it to the Family Guy movie. What are you on? The style of this piece is subtly different to the T.V. show and when it goes into a Big movie moment you really notice and appreciate it. Compared to other small screen animated of recent years e.g. ""South Park"" or ""Beavis and Butthead do America"" it does not feel like an extended episode. Also manages to thrill the most mixed audience I have sat in for years. The audience applauded which is always a good sign.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Just a long Episode ...,"Now I don't want to rag on the Simpsons movie. The Simpsons is one of my all time favorite show.

Ever since the preview/trailer last Superbowl I have been counting down the days until it's release. I hate to say, it wasn't worth the anticipation.Homer saves Springfield after causing the trouble in the first place. Nothing we haven't seen before (ie. the Garbage Commissioner episode).

Definitely not the Simpsons at their best,"The Simpsons Movie (2007), directed by David Silverman, is definitely not the Simpsons at their best. Most of the things that make the Simpsons great on TV--the throwaway gags, the multiple plots, the zingers sent at the Fox network and at the U.S. government, and the incredible cast of supporting characters--are missing from the movie.It's discouraging to realize how little David Silverman accomplished in the 87 minutes (basically four TV shows) with which he was able to work. Instead of giving us four times the fun, he gave us one quarter the fun. OK--the movie was overdue, and I guess any Simpsons movie is better than none, but this was an opportunity wasted.After watching the film, I tried to understand what went wrong. The biggest single problem, in my opinion, is that the plot was too linear. The director and screenwriters forgot that we don't want the Simpsons plot to go from A to B to C. We want it to start at A and go to Q and W before it gets to C, if it ever gets to C at all.Moreover, the movie makers chickened out. On TV they will take on any government institution. Here, the villainous government agency is the EPA. Plenty of government agencies are doing terrible things to the U.S., but I wouldn't exactly put the EPA at the top of the villain's list. As U.S. President, they chose a character meant to be Arnold Schwartzenegger. Now, there are plenty of ways to make fun of the Governor, but no one has suggested he's stupid and, furthermore, he's the one public character that can't become President. No real fun there.So, if you're a Simpsons fan, and you have to see the movie, be warned. If you're not a Simpsons fan, buy the Season I DVD. Then, once you're hooked, you can safely see the film.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Meant more for casual fans than for diehards. Plus, the format just doesn't really work as a movie, I think.","I'm an absolute fanatic of The Simpsons and have been watching it since it was on Tracey Ullman. I grew up with it. I was the exact same age as Bart when the very first episode premiered. Unlike a lot of fans, I've never turned my back on the show. I am not one who thinks each new episode is worse than the last. I do acknowledge that it's long past its peak, but I think almost every new episode is funny enough to be worth seeing. Once in a while, they'll produce an episode that's genuinely fantastic. But, really, I don't demand fantastic. I'll settle for a few good laughs and be at least moderately happy. Now comes The Simpsons Movie, which had been talked about for the last 15 years, at least. Much like when I watch new episodes, I wasn't expecting the movie to be that great. Unfortunately, it fell below even those expectations. It has a few good jokes and moments (the only time I laughed really loud was the Tom Hanks bit), but it doesn't do much right. Those who've long turned their backs on the show like to complain about recycled plot lines. It's true, of course, for pretty much every new episode, but the show has grown more manic and self-referential over time. Many don't like that, either, but I personally do like those kind of jokes. The movie just plods along with a predictable plot that's made up of some of the most basic of all Simpsons plots: Homer and Marge relationship problems, Lisa's environmental concerns, and Bart's loss of faith in his father. None of it here is done with the irony of the newer episodes. It's like it's part of the really early Simpsons, when we hadn't seen these plots a billion times. Except it completely lacks the perfect comic timing of the early seasons. In the end, the movie is only an occasionally amusing affair. Certainly it's worth seeing if you're a fan, but, unless you're the kind of nut I am, you can wait for the DVD.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
An unbiased and fair review from a long time simpsons fan,"It seemed inevitable that one day, a simpsons movie would wind up on the silver screen. It was surprising that it took 18 years or so after the families conception for it to happen, but it did, and it couldn't have come at a better time.Most Simpsons fans have realized that the quality of the TV show dropped tremendously around five years ago. While in the glory days of the show (seasons 4-8 in my opinion) almost every episode was an unforgettable and instant classic, and the show was widely regarded as the funniest, and perhaps the best thing on television. However, something happened along the way. Perhaps it was just the writers running out of ideas, or trying too hard to be funny, or a combination of both, but the simpsons lost its appeal to many fans. Once, watching The simpsons was once a joyous, weekly thing, now, it has become the kind of thing that happens every now and then, when your bored and don't have anything else to do after a watching a football game. Many feared that the movie would resemble the newer seasons, and with good reason. However, I kept optimistic and held my hopes for a great movie firm, and i got what I wanted. The Simpsons movie is clever, memorable, and truly funny with gags bombarding the audience seemingly several times a second. That being said, it is not without its faults.The movie, as many of you have probably heard, is only around 90 minutes long- nowhere near long enough to fit the seemingly thousands of memorable characters fans have become attached to over the years. The creators definitely tried their best, though. While there may not have been enough Apu, or Burns or Skinner, they all make appearances and have their memorable lines. And, perhaps my favorite simpsons character, Ralf Wiggum, has what is likely his funniest line ever. Overall, the use of characters was satisfactory and I don't have many complaints, although some die hards may.The plot of the movie is also damaged by the time constraints, and more severely than the use of characters. The plot definitely feels rushed- there's so many things that will leave you wondering, ""Well, who started this whole thing? Why did this all just happen so suddenly with only a small bit of explanation?"" This is where I just learned to accept it. I filled in the holes on my own, and allowed myself to be entertained by my favorite characters and the funny political satire flowing throughout the film. It's all as dead on and witty as it was in the golden days, and maybe thats enough for me.So in conclusion, I must ask myself this question- Simpsons of the Glory Days, or the Simpsons of today? The answer comes quite easily: This movie is Old School Simpsons, for the most part. Yes, the movie does have some unfunny random humor, Yes, it does have a few too many ""homer falls down"" jokes, and yes, it tries too hard at some times. But, between all that, perhaps in spite of it, there are shining moments of greatness that allows the simpsons to stand amongst the funniest movies of the year- and thats saying a lot, considering we had Knocked Up back in June. And The Simpsons Movie delivers all of this hilarity with a plot line with messages about protecting the environment and corruption in our government, and sends those messages without too much in your face preaching. The whole movie left me wanting more, hoping for a sequel. Not because the movie was unfullfilling, but because i know that after this movie, the creators will have the skill and wisdom to create the perfect simpsons movie- they set themselves on the right track with this movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
As Good As Turning On Your TV?,"Early in the long-awaited, much-debated ""The Simpsons Movie"", legendary TV doofus Dad Homer Simpson makes a good point.""I can't believe we're paying to see something we get on TV for free!"" he tells a theater full of patrons watching the new Itchy & Scratchy movie.Does ""The Simpsons Movie"" justify its long wait, not to mention the money you might have spent for cinema tickets or a DVD rental? Since I borrowed my copy from the library, I'm still wrestling with this one. I was amused and entertained, enjoying the depth of visual information that came with the feature-film budget. But I can tick off a dozen episodes from the TV show's first eight seasons that were better, tighter stories and funnier besides.It's a bad day in Springfield when Homer decides to ignore environmental warnings and dumps a silo full of pig leavings into the local lake. The EPA seals off Springfield with a giant dome, and the Simpsons become fugitives from both the government and their frenzied fellow Springfieldians. Can Homer save the town, or will he lose his family?Director David Silverman and the movie producers try to create a stand-alone feature film while at the same time rallying the Simpsons' deep and loyal fan base. I think they lean too hard in the latter direction. A lot of the film's gags require audience familiarity with secondary and tertiary characters from the TV show, a.k.a. the Comic Book Guy thanking Marge Simpson for letting him wear her pregnancy pants. (""I've never known comfort like this!"") Who would have guessed Cletus the Slack-Jawed Yokel would have more lines than Mr. Burns?The joke of Homer's stupidity is beaten to the ground like Joe Pesci in ""Casino"". But I laughed because it's still funny all these years on. Like Homer's trick of catching fish by dropping a bug zapper into a pond. Or his reason for choosing to move to Alaska: ""Where you can't be too fat or too drunk!""Most of the jokes are single-shot affairs, like what you get these days watching ""The Simpsons"" or its pale imitator, ""Family Guy"". The opportunity to do something appropriately novel with the old formula is largely ignored. The pollution story is neither new nor interesting. The biggest sustained laugh involves Bart skateboarding naked for its numerous hidden-weiner gags. ""Listen kid, no one likes wearing clothes in public,"" an arresting officer tells him. ""But it's the law.""The writers behind ""The Simpsons"" are clever enough to throw a line like that at you every few minutes, and the characters are enjoyable company that don't wear out their welcome. But I never felt I was watching anything here other than bits and pieces that would have wound up on the TV series in some form at some later time.Given that it's ""The Simpsons"", and a national treasure, it's still fun to sit through ""The Simpsons Movie"". But like ""Mt. Rushmore: The Board Game"", I was left wondering about its necessity.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation

Delightful Simpsons-episode to the big screen,"When a successful TV series is being transported to the big screen, there's always some expectations and worries lying ahead. Some of the big screen adaptations of a series works well (""South Park"", ""Ducktales"", I can't remember others by now), others works terrible (""Hannah Montana""). Thankfully, ""Simpsons The Movie"" is not on the latter mentioned category!Since it's already two years since this movie was released, I'll guess many have already seen it, so it's going to be unnecessary to tell the fans to not worry. But for those who haven't seen it; don't worry. ""Simpsons The Movie"" is a delightful and highly entertaining movie experience, series adaptation or not.The movie is fresh, amusing and never gets boring during it's 87 minutes of screen time. It's also surprisingly funny, just as the funniest episodes used to be. It never feels odd or strange to see the characters in a movie situation, since one is used to see them during 21 minutes or so in a episode setting. Almost all the dear and familiar characters from the show are in the movie and their personalities are like you're used to see them. There are some few new touches, though, like the sweet and increasing relationship between Ned Flanders and Bart, Homer bonding to the Spider-Pig and Maggie being smart, which is nice to see.The animation it self lives up to the standard of the series and it's bright, colorful and refreshing, despite there are some few and obvious CGI shots who stands out. The score is great and supports the movie, without being distractive. There are also some few cameos by Green Day and Arnold Schwarzenegger, which is fun to watch. The plot it self isn't so distinctive; like usual, there are some mistakes to make and lessons to learn by the characters, but the story still works pretty well.Overall, I can't recommend ""Simpsons The Movie"" highly enough. It's a successful adaptation of one of the worlds best and funniest series and has the spirit of the show as well.By the way; Get sure to not stop the movie before the end credits roll out.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

Simpsons doesn't deliver,"Depending what generation you're from, you can appreciate ""The Simpsons"" on different levels. I can remember watching one of first episodes with my older siblings when I was five and thinking, this is the funniest show on the planet. Watching it nearly twenty years later, it has lost its spark and everyone waited in fright to see which ""Simpsons"" we were going to be seeing. The film however lies somewhere in between classic Simpsons and broken down, fireless Simpsons. So I guess the viewer got mediocre Simpsons.The Simpsons Movie starts off fantastic with our Itchy and Scratchy humor that we love but after the first twenty minutes are over, Homer and the gang takes a small decline into general second-rate comedy. When Homer accidentally pollutes Springfield's water supply and the government encases the whole town in a glass dome, the people turn on them and declares them enemies.The story is just so ordinary and average that it leaves the classic Simpsons fans, a little dead in the dirt and even worse disappointed. As middle-of-the-road as it may be, Oscar will surely take it on the Animated Feature film list but with the highly acclaimed Ratatouille, Simpsons are left Oscar-less and stuck at the Emmys unless there's a sequel in James L.

Love it or hate it,"In my personal opinion it was a love or hate movie. And at first i really didn't like it. I thought the storyline was a little stupid and they made everybody in Springfeild act retarded just for the sake of it being funny. And it was waaay too short. I mean i am serious when i say this. It felt like a double episode. So don't get comfy in your seat. By the time your halfway through your popcorn it will be over. The storyline was pretty good, not amazing, but you have to cut them some slack. They did EVERYTHING in the god knows how many episodes they have. I love the Simpsons but i'm not going to buy this movie or rent it when it comes out on DVD. I'll watch it again but not in the near future. It was just OK. And i couldn't get over the fact that it was just OK. About 40 minutes into the film it stopped getting funny and the audience wasn't laughing at all. Maybe it was because people we're only laughing through the beginning because it was ""THE SIMPSONS MOVIE"" and had to funny just for that reason, or maybe the writers we're in crappy mood halfway through writing it. I would have really liked it they threw in some famous episode references. It seemed like they forgot their roots, why people ACTUALLy watched this film. The only character that fell into place was Homer. Which i mean.. Okay how do you screw up an idiot? You don't. I wish they took a little more time to make this, make it longer, and add some of the real creative and smart humor that The Simpsons really is made of.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
"I asked myself a question when watching this movie- would it make me love the Simpsons more, or would it ruin the show altogether?","I have to say the answer to my own question is the former. I loved the Simpsons when I was 10-12, but just over a year ago for some reason I stopped watching it. Maybe I didn't find it as funny and creative anymore. Anyway, The Simpsons Movie is a constantly hilarious and witty movie, that completely exceeded my expectations. Yep, it is very silly, but it is lots of fun as well. So much so, I have decided to give the show another chance. The animation is true to the style of that of the show, with crisp colourful backgrounds and excellent character animation. The music by Hans Zimmer is wonderful, while the master has done better work, the music is still pretty darn good. The theme tune is still as irresistibly catchy as it was when the show first started. The story is a good one, there are tons of hilarious moments and one or two heart-warming ones too. Grandpa's revelation in the church at the beginning was hilarious, and I liked it when Lisa finds a special boyfriend in the name of Colin. I did worry that the environmentalist message would be too heavy handed, but it was handled just right. The voice cast do an exceptional job bringing the iconic characters to life, especially Dan Castallenetta as Homer. And they were aided by some delicious dialogue. I have no real complaints of this movie, though if the film was five minutes longer, we could've learned more about EPA. Overall, I thought The Simpsons Movie was absolutely terrific. 9/10 Bethany Cox",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Best Animated Movie Ever!,"The long awaited Simpsons Movie finally opened today, this is the day that Simpsons fans have been dreaming about since there was talk about a Simpsons movie. I just saw the opening show today and I have to say that the Simpsons still have me laughing after all this time. Even though it just felt like another episode, the Simpsons have pushed the envelope a little further into total controversy as the day that the Simpsons show debuted on FOX. If you are a Simpsons fan, I'm more than positive you are going to love the Simpsons Movie. It had great laughs, shocking moments, and just such a fun atmosphere that anyone could have fun with.Springfield is under a watch for global warming, they find out about their lake being polluted and how it will destroy the town unless they stop dumping toxic waste into the water. But Homer pushes it when he dumps more ""crap"" into the lake and it causes harm to animals. The EPA places a dome around Springfield to protect others from entering it's harmful environment, but leaves the whole town's population in the dome. When they learn that it was Homer's actions that caused this, they go after him and the family, but they escape through a hole in the ground. They go to Alaska, but find out that the EPA has deadly plans for Springfield and the Simpsons have to stop them.Even though I was expecting more, I was extremely happy with what I got. It is like a typical episode in some ways, but I love the Simpsons, I'm going to be a fan 'till the day I die, so I just naturally love this film. I know that sounds biased, but other Simpsons fans can relate, I'm sure. The Simpsons movie is an absolute blast of great laughter and fun, it even gets emotional, I smell Oscars! Lol, just kidding, but please have fun and watch the Simpsons Movie, I'm sure you'll love it.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

I ex specially love the way that they bring things from previous episodes back in. Plus i would have to agree this is no were near as good as the family guy movie. Surfe i love family guy better than the Simpson's but this movie kicked family guys ass way far!! In fact it was so good when i finished watching it everyone in the cinema stood up and applauded!! The Simpson's humor in this movie is great and plus there is a scene in this movie(don't wanna spoil it)where i felt like crying it is so emotional. It was a standing ovation.

D'oh!,"The last movie I watched was the hysterically funny (for all the right reasons) Transformers, but obviously I expected this to eclipse that. Bluntly, it didn't. At its best, it prompted a smile, maybe even a snigger, but this was nowhere near the best that the Simpsons can be. Whereas the best episodes feel like 40 minutes of material stuffed into 20 minutes of episode, bursting at the seams with content and comedy, this film felt like 40 minutes of material stretched out over 80 minutes of film. There was no pace, no zip, no zing, and, almost, no characters!?! Homer was always going to be the centre of the film (and rightly so) but where on earth was the rest of the town? (Okay, I know, they were under the big dome  it was a rhetorical question). Why no real time for Apu, Mr Burns, Mrs Krabapple and the rest? Basically, this was an average Simpsons episode that went on a bit. Still funny in places, but very disappointing when you think what might have been. Oh, and in case you missed it, there are infrequent, subtle hints about environmental issues",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Hilarious but Lacking True Plot,"The Simpsons has become part of our culture like none other. They have been around for nearly 20 years, and are still going strong, with end of the series not even a speck on the horizon. It was inevitable that they come out with a movie sooner or later, and for the most part, The Simpsons Movie is worth the wait. It is rife with the self-aware irony, witty satire, scathing parody, and hilarious comedy that the TV show has become known for. In fact, it is so much like the TV show that, if you weren't sitting in a darkened room surrounded by hundreds of people, you could be fooled into thinking it was a three-parter episode. In a film where hilarity is a given, something more must be asked of it, and, unfortunately, the Simpsons fails to stretch itself in any way, being content, for the most part, to stick with its tried an true formula.Rather than attempt to explain the paper thin plot, I'll just summarize the basic idea for you. Springfield's lake is dangerously over-polluted, so the city puts a ban on dumping any further garbage into the lake. Homer, of course, screws everything up because of his mis-directed love for a young pig, and thus the US government forces all of Springfield to live under a giant indestructible dome, causing the town to riot against the cause of everything (Homer, once again), forcing the Simpson family to escape the indestructible dome and flee to Alaska to start anew. Meanwhile, Bart must deal with a realization that Homer is unsatisfactory as a Dad, Lisa finds the perfect guy for her, and the ever-enduring Marge has to question whether she really wants to endure any longer.With 400 episodes under their belt and counting, one thing the Simpsons have to be respected for is their longevity. No other TV series (aside from the Tonight Show, which doesn't even really count) has managed to stay alive this long, while still maintaining a healthily hilarious pulse. Though it doesn't carry as much clout as it once did, each new TV episode that comes out manages to be satirical, witty, and downright hilarious. The Simpsons movie is all of these things, lampooning religion, environmentalism, the government, and a sizable helping of other subjects too (most notable a spot-on cameo of a very notable star.) The movie is just plain hilarious - no question. There weren't two minutes during this film where I wasn't practically busting a gut laughing. But one also has to take into account that with 400 episodes down the drain, there aren't many plot-lines left to do. I'm not a huge fan of the TV show - I respect it and appreciate its witty comedy and satire, but I'm not a regular watcher, so I can't speak to whether or not this plot has been done before, but one very clear thing that I did notice was that if everything superfluous were stripped away, the movie would be about the length of a 44-minute Simpsons special.Take Homer's love for the pig - the thing which causes him to bring ruin to the entire town. Though it does give us the line that is already becoming a classic - ""Spider-Pig, Spider-Pig, does whatever a Spider-Pig does...Can he swing - from a web? No he can't, he's a pig..."" this whole thing is basically a plot device - once the pig has served his purpose we really don't see him anymore. Lisa's new crush is basically just adding on a little romantic subplot that doesn't affect the outcome of the film at all, and Bart's questioning his father's love is merely for the sake of adding screen time. If enough work had been put into the plot, all these things could have worked together towards a resolution - but as it is the only strong thread that runs the length of the movie is Homer. Marge questioning her devotion to Homer comes in a close second, and it's good to see some real conflict in these characters we love, but it's not enough to save the paper thin plot. Another disappointment is that none of the extra characters have any strong involvement - we see cameos from Moe and the gang, but that's all they are. Ironically the strongest character in the movie (aside from Homer) is a government official whom I don't believe has been in the TV series at all.All this criticism being leveled against it, though, I would still give it a positive recommendation. It's a disappointment if you're looking for something beyond the series fare, but if you're just looking for a solid comedy, look no further. One of the reasons it's disappointing is because of the sheer comedic brilliance that we've seen these writers capable of. If they can write comedy like that, don't you think they could have at least come up with a plot that doesn't artificially extend itself with four or five superfluous story lines? Apparently not. Eh. Maybe they'll do better with the next movie. Because whether the series continues or not, you can bet this is not the last of our favorite yellow family's visit to the silver screen.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
"What Ever The Outcome, You Will Still Watch It, Afterall It is The Simpsons.","To me people are trying real hard to like this movie and their beloved character Homer, and so they rated this movie with a handsome review. But for me it was merely a decent movie experience – after 150 plus draft they have chosen this one to work on, seriously? That was really weak.Is this movie written by The Simpsons’ writers or Al Gore? This is not really the story you would expected from the good episode of The Simpsons. There wasn’t much plot at all. It felt weird and though I love the randomness but the pace is fast but it feel really brief and it keep on skipping. Sure it was entertaining but it was not funny ha-ha.The good thing is visually it look very stunning, I love it. It looks absolutely joyful and colorful, and the direction is great. But I didn’t quite find the story very compelling. Homer is too hypocrite in here.Tell the truth I had a pretty hard time writing this - it is The Simpsons; what is at you there in series that you haven’t seen it yet? This is like a longer episode of it. They even managed to put all the character even for a few seconds.Ask if it still entertaining, yes it is!! Not a fully let down. Maybe my expectations are too high on it.Recommendation: Managed enough for me to still buy its DVD.Reason to Watch: What More? It is The Simpsons.Reason Not To: Not a very good Rating: 6/10 (Grade: C+)",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Relieved that it didn't suck, but that's about it","This movie has some incredibly witty moments, but sadly pretty much all of those can be found in the first half hour. That first half hour perfectly captures what ""The Simpsons"" were like in their first ten seasons or so, but also cleverly brings in new elements. Also, it has Ralph seeing Bart naked on the street and going ""I like boys now"". I think that moment alone should deserve six stars, but I digress. Then a plot kicks in about Homer polluting a lake and being hated by everyone and the movie really starts dragging itself to the end more and more. From then on there isn't really much creativity left, it's just the Simpsons running from one place to another and some attempts to political satire that come of as rejected material from ""South Park"". I get it, Arnold Schwarzenegger doesn't seem very bright, now move on. This movie is only 83 minutes long, but it really feels like they had to do anything they could to even reach that length. Overall, this movie isn't a total disaster like some have claimed, but I did expect a bit more from these writers.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation

A good effort,"Ultimately I feel that Simpsons fans WILL be satisfied with this movie. The bottom line is, this movie is funny. The gags and one liners are pretty much what one would expect from the writers and the animation is quite good. If you like the show you will probably like the movie.That being said, I don't think there is anything really remarkable or special about this piece. I have heard the criticism, ""It's just like one long episode,"" repeated over and over again. I don't think that's really the case here. In a lot of ways, I don't think there's really much of the same ""feeling"" that the episodes have. For a show that is driven by so many diverse characters, I would have expected more interaction and complexity. The plot is a standard morality tale focusing most of its energy and screen time on the Simpsons themselves. Although the movie is funny, it lacks the contribution of many of the characters that have made the show so enjoyable. The plot is far more outlandish than what most of the episodes offer, and I felt that this was somewhat off-putting. The post modern, self referential tone has begun to run thin. I gave this movie a 6, as I feel that it WAS indeed funny, but far to disorganized to warrant a higher score. See it, if only to lament how good the show used to be.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation

"'Funny, Entertaining, Crude- Everything you want it to be'  Puts the SPRING in Springfield!!!","Finally I have had the pleasure after many long years of waiting to screen test this movie- and afterwards I can scarcely say this is definitely going to be the highest grossing animated movie ever made!! It has all the usual characters (its obvious when watching that the creators wanted to show every character from the TV series even if it means giving them a small part) of course there's Homer, who is as loud and proud as always, and Marge, who is cautious but loving throughout Homers huge mishap (which would stretch out to be the storyline) and Bart, Lisa and Maggie are all back too.The storyline is quite different for a Simpsons theme- Homer miraculously pollutes the local river, thus the power plant is closed down and the residents of Springfield are evacuated. Cue the Simpsons who must fight to save their town or lose it forever!!! I was interested to discover that Mo was given a lot of the limelight in this movie, and that Homer was less seen than some of the other characters- hmm... Anyways, there really is little to criticise about this movie. A lot of people are rattling on about the movie being too similar to a single stretched-out episode, but this was always going to be an issue from the beginning. I suppose if you go into the movie expecting an overly long episode then thats what you'll get, but if you take it with a pinch of salt then the Simpsons Movie is great fun, and very funny.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Enjoyable even if it falls far short of the series at its best,"Homer takes a pig into the family but, as much as it amuses him, it messes up the house and makes Bart feel even more isolated from his father. Meanwhile Lisa finds a soul-mate in her quest to educate the community in local environmental matters. However when Homer finds that his pig excrement problem is getting out of control, he dumps the silo in the lake  triggering an environmental catastrophe. On the orders of President Schwarzenegger, EPA director Russ Cargill seals Springfield in a plastic dome. Resources naturally run low and the town yet again turns on Homer and the Simpsons.Out of a summer of mostly mediocre sequels and franchise movies, The Simpsons stood out as the one that many audiences were waiting for the most. I know I went on a weekend night (and I hate crowds  particularly noisy multiplex crowds) in my desire to see it. The film itself though, doesn't really live up to the expectation and, although funny, does come across like the faltering first steps of a baby  at times moving quickly but mostly looking like it is about to fall over at any moment. Part of the reason for this is probably that the bar is set too high  something that it did for itself. Of course being a brilliant TV series is hardly a criticism but it does work against the film, particularly as it struggles to fit into the 90 minute format.It isn't so much the matter of having enough plot to fill it, because the Simpsons has always jumped around quickly  using one event to lead to another and then another. However doing it across this length of time is not quite the same. Strangely though it wasn't this I had the problem with, it was the way the film format meant that it did have to have more of a ""narrative"" feel to it with more talking and plot development. The problem with this is that it is such foreign territory that it stands out  it jars with the funny moments (of which there are plenty) and I found myself wanting more of the latter and slightly put off by the former. It is not that the plot is bad, but just it breaks up the normal tight and fast pace that I am used to with the episodes and I missed this.Is it funny though? Well, yes, it is but just not as funny as the many, many brilliant episodes that I enjoy. It is rarely as smart and witty as the TV series. The style of humour is typical but at times it is a bit obvious and not as out and out clever as I would have hoped for  again perhaps a problem associated with the bar being set high by expectations from the TV series. This is not to say that it isn't funny because there are still plenty of great moments and lines but they don't merge into a great flow  rather they are asides from the main plot. In a way the attempt to have more of a ""story"" with character threads mean that there is less time for the quickfire material and it shows in the way that many characters are limited in their screen time. Of particular disappointment is Mr Burns being limited to just one scene  albeit one of the best of the film, complete with the most typically Simpsons line ""ah, for once the rich, white man is in control"". The voice cast are all great, despite some of the many, many characters having little to do; while guest stars are wisely limited to Green Day and Tom Hanks.Overall then, it is a very funny and enjoyable movie that is fun despite the fact that it never really finds a consistent pace or flow. Fans will enjoy it as much as they are disappointed perhaps but it is still a good film that is one of the best films from a mostly lacklustre summer offering thus far.",,Anonymous,Animation
It finally came...but sadly just went,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningAfter a concert at Springfield Lake where the band Green Day nearly drowned due to the pollution there, Lisa starts campaigning to save the local environment and in so doing crosses paths with a charming young Irish boy who she falls in love with. Meanwhile Bart's once again growing resentful of Homer's bad parenting skills and when he starts to show more attention to a pig he rescued from Krusty Burger he turns to next door neighbour Ned for guidance.It's this pig that kicks the main part of the plot off, as Homer selfishly dumps a silo he's been using to store it's waste in SL, and causes a major environmental catastrophe. This causes the EPA to drop a massive dome around Springfield and when the townspeople find out it's Homer's fault, they all turn out to lynch him. the family manage to escape to Alaska, but Homer's selfishness drives everyone away once again and, realizing he stands to lose everything that matters to him, Homer hot foots it back to Springfield to sort out the mess he created and patch things up with his loved ones.When The Simpsons first appeared as a tiny sketch show on The Tracey Ullman Show in 1987, it was hard to imagine that twenty years later it would be the most successful cartoon and lasting cartoon shows ever (more so than the Bugs Bunny cartoons from Warner Brothers in the 1950s) and finally a movie's been made about it. I really got it into my head that tonnes of praise would be heaped upon it, with five star reviews coming left and right. But most critics simply lamented how average the movie turned out to be, struggling to give it any more than about three stars. And I'm afraid, speaking as a long time fan of the show, I can kind of see their point.It's been ten years in the making and it's testament to how difficult it's been to make that it wasn't out by the time the show was at the height of it's success in the 90s. But one episode takes six months to make, so a film was always going to be tricky, no matter how great the demand for it. But, unfortunately, that may be a big part of the problem. The show's still very popular, but not as much as the time when it was really cutting edge (especially for a cartoon series) and not afraid to poke fun at sensitive subjects in the news and around the world at the time. The movie plays it too safe, keeping the clever gags down to taking pot shots at well known films, including Titanic, An Inconvenient Truth, Independence Day, Night of the Living Dead and disaster films from the 70s, as well as celebrity cameos from the likes of Green Day, Arnold Schwarzenegger and Tom Hanks. The plot struggles to endure the 80 minute running time, without a solid narrative flow and a bit incoherent. The cracks start to show quite early on as you notice what works well for half an hour can't quite translate to a feature length film.Having been a dedicated and loyal fan of the show for over ten years now, finally seeing The Simpsons Movie is something I can only compare to finally having sex, really. Something I really built myself up for only to be left, to be honest, a bit disappointed. ***",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
"To coin a phrase: It's OK, but I like their old stuff better...","Ahhhh, The Simpsons, 20+ years and still going strong... well still going anyway.I think breaking point for me came when I recently felt strongly enough about a new episode that I rang a friend to tell him that the new Simpsons episode was actually very good. That's depressing when you think about it, especially considering that I've been watching it (and loving it) since Day 1. It's been maybe 10 years since I could make that call and mean it.So after nearly 20 years they decide to announce a movie at last, or realistically 10 years after at last. Once it finally did arrive though the film was pretty good, better than I expected early on... but as I will point out again and again momentum just couldn't last.Thanks to Homer (of course) Springfield has become the most polluted city in America, in an update on Escape from New York it is ""domed off"" with a giant glass object from which there is apparently no escape. The inhabitants of Springfield are - as the creator of the dome puts it - trapped like carrots.It is the events leading up to the doming and subsequent escape that showed the most promise. All of the show regulars were shown but many seemed underutilised (Burns and Smithers get maybe 1 minute total). There are some quality jokes to be had, mostly due to Homer's lack of parenting skills and people getting hurt. There is also some full Bartal nudity.The guest star (if you can have one in a film, and I'm saying you CAN!) is Russ Cargill, the boss of the Environmental Protection Agency who places the dome to protect the Earth. He is voiced by Albert Brooks (Marlin himself!) and he gets most of the best lines in the movie, including the ""trapped like carrots"" one mentioned earlier.Unfortunately though what ensues is strongly reminiscent of the show's lifespan so far;* Great start.* Homer gets most of the laughs.* Marge is the voice of reason and the bringer of down.* Lisa has a subplot that goes nowhere.* Show runs out of momentum halfway and we must realise the best is behind us.In fact I can now pinpoint the exact moment that the movie loses it...35 minutes. Simpson family escapes the dome, Cargill orders around the clock surveillance, has a soft/tuff guy rant and admits to being drunk with power. It is a brilliant 30 seconds, unfortunately nothing after it comes close to being as good.><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><The Simpsons are pariahs in their own town and flee to Alaska, only once happily ensconsed in Palin's backyard they find out that Cargill has started to doubt his own dome and has a far more severe and permanent Plan B in mind for Springfield.Marge and the kids set off to save the day while Homer searches for a deeper truth... which he finds when he meets a lady with giant boobs. Aren't they always the answer.In truth Giant boob-lady is just gimmicky and tacky, the Lisa's new admirer bit was a waste of time aside from giving her a few minutes screen time and Marge has little to do in the film aside from doubt her marriage.The first half was actually pretty great even if the only thing the dopey and impressionable remember is Spiderpig. If you watched the second half in isolation as two 20 minute episodes you would go away very unimpressed.I still love The Simpsons, but boosting the first half of a film is a little like cheering when your sports team loses narrowly to a better opponent. An honourable defeat, but a defeat nonetheless. Despite that even though this is by no means classic it has enough good jokes and even sub-par Simpsons is still funny.Final Rating - 7.5 / 10. All the bagging and a 7.5? As I said, average Simpsons is still pretty good. If you like The Simpsons: You will laugh. You will very likely enjoy this.

Family Guy The Movie - Special Yellow Edition,"I've been waiting for a Simpsons movie since I was a kid. I gave up hope and went on with my life as I got older, but the fans of old and new were still waiting for that holy grail to suddenly appear.It finally came many years later. And, not surprisingly, i've never been so disappointed. I read one review state that this wasn't an ""extended episode"" compared to South Park: BLAU and Beavis and Butthead Do America. That person could never been more wrong. While the Simpsons had its moments, taking advantage of what it could accomplish on the big screen that the little screen couldn't handle (fancy CG effects, akin to Futurama) it failed to do the little things. And those little things pile up and MAKE the movie.Beavis and Butthead had an epic journey that spanned some of America. What we got in the Simpsons was a trip to Alaska (probably written in to showcase how pretty the movie can look) and...yeah, that's pretty much it. I thought it was kind of pointless. The journey in Beavis and Butthead actually had a point and was consistent with it. Simpsons had everything tacked in just cause it wanted to be funny. Like they had a bunch of good ideas for jokes and they just picked the best ones, then based a story around it.South Park was more epic. It made use of its R rating by going BEYOND the show and even went as far to include musical numbers. Creators Matt Stone and Trey Parker went on to state they wanted to make a movie and do some of the things they couldn't do for television. And they did just that. Simpsons, of course, didn't hit that mark. It was really a long modern Simpsons episode with Futurama-esquire CG riddled here and there to give the impression it was bigger and better than a normal TV episode. Everything else was styled in the same way as the TV show, there wasn't much to clearly make it look cinematic. Even the straight to DVD Furturama movie made up for lack of cinematic presentation with a mindblowingly good (and well thought out) story.One of the biggest faults of this movie was the fact that it relied too heavily on Family Guy humor. Jokes that are too random and is not consistent to the story (or what little story it has). This has been going on for a few years since the Family Guy fad was in its peak. Even before, it was already steadily going downhill. Unfortunately, that carried over to this movie. Some of the jokes, especially involving a certain Pig and Maggie, fall way flat. No one in my theater was laughing. Some kid next to me was even going ""okay..."" during some of the so-called highlights of the film. I had the exact same thoughts, so did my friend, and so did everyone else in the theater. And the staple of the series, the character driven story lines, were completely absent.They tried to do something like that with Bart and the Flanders family but the chemistry didn't work. It was incredibly weak how they tried to make Homer the screw up and why Bart decided to defect to the Flanders' family. Plus hasn't that already been done before? Can't really blame them for that, a show running for nearly 20 years and you're bound to run out of ideas. Plus I didn't have any sympathy for Homer. He was just dumb, not lovable dumb just...dumb. He was the cause of everything, but it seemed like he could care less. The old lovable Homer would've done all these things by accident, not knowing the harm it could bring to everyone. I also expected Maggie to play a pivotal part and was really disappointed when she was just reduced to a quick gag. The only reason why I give it a 6 instead of a 4 or 5 is cause its the Simpsons. And it's not even the Simpsons I (and millions of other people) grew up with, but its that nostalgia that gripped me and paid for my ticket ultimately. Without that, this movie would've bombed hard. I'm sure at least half of the people that saw this wanted to see classic Simpsons in the big screen even though it can't be possible now (despite many of the old writers and one of the bigger series directors coming back).By the end of it, there was no applause. Other highly anticipated movies like the Dark Knight and Spiderman were met with applause in the end, but not this movie. Everyone just upped and left. Disappointed. This is really sad since the Simpsons is actually more iconic to modern society than either Batman or Spiderman. What's worse is that the newer episodes i've seen are finally going back to the basics: homer is not as stupid, character driven story lines are back, and the humor is stripped from its Family Guy shackles and goes back to being coherent to the story.There is a rumor (maybe an early confirmation?) that a sequel is in the works.

"Now, Go Back and Watch the Show","Because I came to the show late because of a son who has been quite passionate, I never had the luxury of seeing it with any sort of consistency. I'm sixty years old and yet I take something away from nearly every episode I see. I don't know the names of all the characters, but the social commentary and the outrageousness is all I need. I listened to an interview with, I believe Matt Groening (though it could have been someone else). This man was asked if there would be a last show where everything would get wrapped up, like the controversial Sopranos. He said that there has never been a consistent plot line. Each episode stands on its own and, if there is a last one, it will be an episode like all the rest, that takes shots at our human failings and has Homer eating too much. I thought this movie was a joy. It pulls no punches. It shows us at our selfish worst but who cares? Tomorrow is another day and it will all work itself out (or we may all be destroyed in a nuclear disaster--whatever). If this movie is your first experience with the Simpsons, go back and see the show. The movie is very good, but it just continues in an hour and a half, what each half-hour does each week.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Not a patch on old Simpsons but oddly enjoyable,"Homer Simpson ignores the no dumping in the lake policy and soon he and his family are on the run after Springfield is declared hazardous and placed under a dome.The yellow American family come to the big screen in one of the most anticipated films of 2007. Despite being up against Transformers, Bourne Ultimatum and Harry Potter the order of the phoenix, the Simpsons Movie still grossed millions all over the globe thanks to its massive fan base and the show itself has now become legendary.The Simpsons has become bigger than any other TV show and has been showing now for almost 20 years and with all the DVDs, specials and a collection of merchandise that will never end, a film was inevitable.Sadly the show has hit a slump these last 5 or so years with unfunny parodies of celebrities, predictable slapstick humour and a meaningless narrative.This picture uses the TV show's recent trends to get its entertainment across. There is plenty of obvious humour such as an Arnold Schwarzenegger President, Lisa's love life and a typical and frankly boring villain.What is good however is Matt Groening's depiction of real life. He uses real life issues and puts a good spin around them such as advertisement, nudity and a collection of others in the end credits.Homer's opening line is typical mocking of film life.Though this film's ultimate goal is to entertain, it is a feel good hour and a half joy ride with occasional moments of old classic Simpsons but majorly lacking a cutting edge style to surprise and shock.This feels like a stretched episode which you don't get for free. The plot feels ordinary in every sense and the only difference from a normal episode is that these jokes about films make it different from normal sofa views.If you are currently enjoying current series then you will not be disappointed but if you remember the days when the Simpsons really entertained through a sophisticated story, unsurprising hilarity and a group of real life characters we could all relate to then I am sorry to say this film doesn't have anything to bring that back.The Simpsons Movie is moderately enjoyable at times, but always predictable with an occasional film joke that was only funny in the cinema.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Simply A Masterpiece,"The greatest TV cartoon ever made has finally been made into a movie. The Simpsons Movie is just as funny and clever as the TV series, if not more-so. While the plot may not be as well developed, it's a more than attractive story to me. This is quite easily the funniest movie of 2007. It's quite possible you'll die of oxygen deficiency, you'll be laughing so hard. There are so many funny things in this movie, I couldn't possibly list them all here, but I will list the ones I can remember. The opening Green Day scene, the church scene, Homer & Bart on the roof, Russ Cargill, President Schwarzenegger, Homer whipping the sled dogs, and that random pig. There are also a few emotional scenes here and there, and that's one of the things that made the TV show great. The animation and the music are even better than in the TV series, of course. This movie is just amazing. Right after Ratatouille and Surf's Up, The Simpsons Movie is my third favorite movie of summer 2007. My sincerest thanks to Matt Groening and company.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Something in between,"First I must make it clear that I'm a huge Simpsons and Futurama fan.When it comes to the Simpsons episodes, I will make it clear that they are the product of genius's.So, it was logical that I believed Simpsons the movie would be just as great, but I was wrong. The idea with the episodes is that they are only around 22 minutes long. During that time, you probably laugh several times, seen some kind of parody, and found out that the beginning plot had actually nothing to do with the ending. GOD I just love Simpsons. Therefor, you see that most stuff happening in this movie, have something to do with the plot. I will admit that this movie had some fun stuff in it, but compared to the episodes where you laugh several times during 22 minutes, while this movie is 87 minutes, I believe you get more fun by watching 4 episodes instead.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
It could have worked better as a two parter TV episode.,"A movie about the yellow Simpsons family was in the making for a while. There was rumors about it from the late 90's and finally it did see the light in 2007. So, how did it turn out? Even though this is called ""The Simpsons Movie""it actually could have worked better as a two separate episodes in the show instead, as in the state it is now presented it has far too much empty spaces in it just to drag it in the feature movie length.There actually is very little difference in the story structure of the movie and the most resent ""The Simpsons"" episodes, as the structure usually has Homer doing something stupid, the family resenting his actions and the deus ex something, which saves the day in some extent.I'm not slamming the movie though, it's not a bad film, as I did laugh and chuckle, but in the end it just doesn't work that well as a movie. But because it did made a mint of money, there's no doubt, that there wouldn't be an another attempt in the future, so here's for hoping they do a better job with it.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation

this movie was awful,"i don't know who you people are or what you know about the Simpsons, but they utterly and fantastically DESTROYED the Simpsons as we knew them!Yes the animation was improved compared to the television series, but who the in the world expected it to be the same?! the fact of the matter is the characters interactions were moderatley low, the ambient background extras were down and out the worst animated loops I've EVER seen (not even in the show do they do loops like that, seriously who hired these idiot animators)did anyone else notice that they skipped from animating on 1's to like 4's for no reason at all?!the plot, oh my god, whoever said that plot was good or original or inventive or just plain smart is a down out IDIOT! I have never seen such a generic, rushed and sloppy, thrown together plot in a movie for years. The Simpsons have had 20 years on the tele, how the hell didn't they think of a plot to do in that much time?! ""hey bill wanna write the Simpsons movie and make it really good and funny?""""No Ted, why don't we just rush it ad NO FUNNY jokes and make it about the town exploding, while we are at it why not just fill the advertisements with propaganda which makes people want to see it, and leave them totally unfulfilled?"" ""I like your thinking, you should work for the government""Okay I covered Plot and Bad animation, oh yes profiles.Since when did the Simpsons ever show Bart drinking alcohol?! HES 10 YEARS OLD what the hell! why don't we just throw in some hookers and blackjack!?The main character that they destroyed was the main character Homer... Never in any kind of episode was Homer ever this selfish and self-centered, the writers must have been stuck and thought ""i know! We can make Homer stupidly overly selfish and go on from there!"" What were they thinking?!throughout the entire movie i laughed possibly twice, once was at spider pig (always has been funny but i saw that on the adverts so it wasn't really too funny. and another time i cant remember)I seriously considered crashing my car on the way home from the movie theatre so something interesting would happen.L2P FOX 0/10",,Anonymous,Animation
A good movie,"Homer, due to his ""high"" level of intellect, pollutes Springfield's lake with a silo full of crap and as a result, the government of USA isolates the entire city in a giant glass dome. An angry mob chases him and his family but they miraculously escape, going straight to Alaska to start a new life. All seems fine but when they realize that Springfield is going to be ""transformed"" into a new Grand Canyon, they decide that something must be done. From there, a real struggle begins, both morally and physically. Is Homer going to help his family defeat the government or Springfield is going to be eradicated from the face of the earth?

Entertaining - and a bit more adult than the show,"I have seen the long-lived TV show only a few times a year since it began, but I've always found it amusing (if not worth tuning in for). I am also not a big fan of comedy. So, needless to say my expectations were not very high when I went to see this with some friends tonight.The film surpassed my expectations, as the show usually does. The characterization is consistent with the series and the Addams family of the '90s is just as lovably screwed up as they have always been.The central problem this time is that, partly due to Homer's behavior, the levels of pollution in Springfield are so high that the EPA quarantines the entire town. A lynch mob goes after the family, but they escape to Alaska to start a new life. The plot set-up is also cleverly connected to religious superstitions and mass-paranoia. This takes us about half an hour or maybe a little further into the film.There are plenty of relatively smart jokes (compared to the average Will Ferrell flick), with some satirical political overtones, and a bit of risqué humor as well.I recommend The Simpsons Movie to fans of the show, and friends of fans. While I don't really think the film is entirely appropriate for young kids, it should be fine for most of the family (teen plus).",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
"""Do-oh""n't miss out","Having not seen this movie since my second viewing in 2008, I thought for The August Rush pop this one in and see it again because my memory was foggy on this film. The Simpsons Movie is a lighthearted, fun movie that never bores and has something happening every second. Homer is surprised to find that a bunch of ""giant suckers"" paid to see a movie like this when it will come on TV for free. The Simpsons have ran for currently twenty one seasons, producing over four hundred episodes and have a merchandise line as long as The Great Wall of China. With action figures, dolls, slippers, posters, apparel, an Xbox, DVDs, VHS tapes, Blu-Rays, and now a movie to go along with, The Simpsons are in good shape to a possible 30th season and maybe longer.The Simpsons is probably one of the only classic animated programs on TV anymore with others like South Park and Spongebob Squarepants. No show has ran for as long and has had so much publicity like The Simpsons. Not being the biggest fan of the show, but having seen various episodes and possessing knowledge of the show I knew I had to see this. I wasn't surprised a movie of the yellow family was made.The film is something that couldn't be cut down to a thirty minute show. Springfield Lake is already in trouble with pollution, but gets worse after Homer adopts a pig from Krusty Burger. To store the pig's droppings, he gets a big silo labeled ""Pig Crap"". Marge tells him to dispose of the pig's droppings and he does so by dropping the gigantic silo into the Springfield Lake causing mad pollution. Russ Cargill, the head of the EPA, talks it over with President Schwarzenegger and they choose (if you want to call it that) to put a gigantic dome over Springfield to contain it's severe pollution causing the whole town to erupt in anger to The Simpson Family and forcing them out of the town. The Simpsons find a way out of the town and are on the run away from the EPA.The film is cute and very energetic like its on its own medicine. Its a fine example of a TV show that has a good film adaptation. One down fall of the film is it's afraid to take risks. While earning a PG-13 rating, we only see three things (language, finger gestures, and nudity) that we would never see on FOX. South Park: Bigger, Longer, and Uncut however took numerous jumps that Comedy Central would never allow. It still holds the record for most swear words in an animated movie (with 139 uses of ""the f word"").If only The Simpsons Movie took more leaps and didn't have to shade their faces whenever they made a big step. The Simpsons have kept their near squeaky clean appearance on television for more than twenty years, they deserve a couple leaps. Not to say it was bad, just once in a while, everything needs to step up. Also, its a shame that some characters like Principal Skinner and Miss Crabapple didn't get bigger roles in the movie. Some character like them and Chief Wiggum I wish played a bigger part in this movie.Other than that, The Simpsons Movie is a highly enjoyable animated movie that shows after twenty years on the air, The Simpsons can still bring hard laughs and amusing one liners that are memorable. Seeing this film after a two year absence gave me a boatload of fresh laughs and a very funny plot. The Simpsons Movie isn't just a movie, its an enjoyable animated ride with the family we love.Voices of: Dan Castellaneta, Julie Kavner, Nancy Cartwright, Yeardley Smith, Hank Azaria, Harry Shearer, Albert Brooks, and Tress MacNeille.

Should never have been a movie,"It's obvious that a standard Simpson's formula for an episode could not be extended to make a real movie. I personally would have left the idea, unless the money dividends were huge, (which they probably are) The movie has a rather different tint to the Simpson's we all know. I feel it has borrowed heavily from the Seth Mcfarlanes Family Guy which admittedly made quite a few parts funny but I wouldn't consider the creators to have the same experience in that are of humour.I enjoyed the movie at the beginning but then it became too random and it didn't seem to reach me. It was a big let down because of the hype, however i always retain that cartoon series', just like computer games, shouldn't be made into films. I guess its a money thing, who's going to turn down millions?",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Disappointing,Being an avid fan of the Simpson's i find this filth to be utterly disappointing.As with Shrek the third it was a case of too many cooks spoiling the broth. Any of the good jokes were given in the first twenty minutes the remaining were to few and far between for the remaining hour(not to mention crass).The plot just did not make sense as if the writers didn't even try to bother writing one at all.Being from Ireland I am a lot more critical of the Simpson's despite the last few series being OK - good.Like many of the people in the cinema i felt like leaving half way through.One line that best describes how I and many others felt is homers ironic critique of the preceding itchy and scratchy cartoon: Why pay to see this in a cinema when we could watch it at home for free.

FIRST 20 MINUTES WERE GREAT (the length of a regular episode),"I wanted this movie to be great because I hoped for a lot of corporate bashing. This movie showed evil polluters, trigger happy cops, lying government, etc., Not a lot of corporate bashing unfortunately.The first 20 minutes of this movie were great. After 20 minutes, it started to show some serious cracks as prototypical Simpson's bits became tiresome. After 40 minutes it became so boring that I stopped watching it and did some chores as I listened to it in the background.Overall, this movie was ruined by the fact that the Simpson's creators and writers have run out of materials after a decade of writing. This movie should have been released 7 years ago, by which, they could have released 2 or 3 sequels. They know they missed out on a grand movie franchise opportunity and now they are feeling lucky this movie has been the biggest movie of the Summer, 2007.All in all, it is still worth watching but beware the corporate messages placed in the story - people ruining the environment (not corporations), evil G.O.'s, etc. ,",6.0,Anonymous,Animation

Did this movie really have to be made??!!,"Am i a fan of the Simpson's?..Yes! I am. Not the kind that has seen every episode and remembers them but I've seen a few hundred of them and thats a lot.Was I looking forward to this movie?No s#$t.Did I have sky high expectations from this movie?Surprisingly I didn't.(not that surprising if you consider the kind of bug hype movies that have let down expectations this year).Basically I'm describing the a whole bunch of people, which includes a large portion of North America.Im all for the feature length and big screen adaptations of popular serials, and genuinely feel that often the larger running time, canvas and BUDGET, add a whole lot to the serials.This was true in lots of cases, especially in the big screen adaptations of yesteryear's serials like Charlie's angels (it had its moments), The X-files, serenity etc.But if the ""BIGGER EVERYTHING"", isn't going to add much to the movie, then i don't see the reason why I should be spending 240 rs, to watch the movie, when I can watch the serial for free, or watch it on TV later.Unfortunately this was the case in the movie.The graphics were only at par with the serial, and the slightly deviations from the style on TV was more of a distraction than a genuine addition.The Dolby surround was used but added nothing to the movie.Im sure the budget was several times the serials (and not proportionate to 87/22, the average serial run time to this movies length), but this did nothing for the movie.The longer length could have meant many more gags and a rare instance of lots of parallel stories plots and sub-plots, with larger than normal footage given to more than a couple of characters (usually besides the family only a few characters are given much footage), but instead it ended up being almost boring in a few parts, IN BETTER DAYS THE BEST JOKES FROM THIS MOVIE AND A LESS STRETCHED OUT PLOT WOULD HAVE FORMED A STANDARD 30 MIN SERIAL OR AT MOST A ONE HOUR SPECIAL.Still the movie had its moments.The standard Simpson's humour was all there, many jokes were hilarious and some had the spark that has often been found missing in the later seasons, the few jokes with Burns and Irish boy, had me reminiscing and laughing at the same time.Although it came close never ever did this movie cross into boring territory, every time you thought that this movie was going to lose a hand, it pulled out an ace from its sleeve.THE GUEST APPEARANCES WERE HILARIOUS, and as big ticket as can get.The shorter than average length insured that you never OD'ed on people you weren't used to seeing in slabs of more than half an hour.SO WERE THE JOKES GOOD AND THE MOVIE ENTERTAINING??YES!??.BUT DOES IT MEAN THAT THIS MOVIE HAD TO BE MADE AND THAT WE SHOULD PAY FULL TICKET PRICES AND WATCH IT IN A THEATER.I don't think so....So if you have to watch this movie (and indeed you should), then please only watch it on DVD, at really really cheap prices in the theater, or better still on good ol TV where I have been enjoying Simpson's since the last 15 years.-s ""BIGGER EVERYTHING"" adds nothing to this movie, feels like a stretched out 1 hour special, potential far from exploited.+/-s did this movie and its theatrical release need to happen, i certainly don't think so.+s jokes were still funny (albiet with breaks of mediocrity), a couple of scenes had that old spark, never bored.total 6/10 (only because i had fun, however it was only as much fun as i would have had seeing it on TV, and because luckily i didn't have that many expectations, if i consider the fact that i felt kind of cheated watching this movie than this movie will crossover below 5 in my opinion).ps The fact that such ordinary cinema has broken the top 250 list is truly scary and its taken me a lot off effort not to change my original rating to a much lower one, only to get the overall rating down.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Very Funny, But It Feels Like Just a Longer ""Simpsons"" Episode","""The Simpsons"" is definitely one of the greatest television shows of all time. Absolutely hilarious satire on pretty much anything that has to do with American culture and lifestyle. If there's a topic, there's probably an episode of the show that at least somehow mentions it or relates back to it.As for ""The Simpsons Movie"", it's also very funny. But the entire premise of there being a definitive feature film adaptation of the show is kind of weird to me. It's true that the show has been pretty poor in quality for over two decades now, and that the movie is probably the best thing that the series has put out during that time period, but it also seemed like it would be an averagely rated episode from its prime during the 90s.Very good animation and a lot of laugh out loud moments, it's just a shame that it doesn't really scratch the whole ""Simpsons"" itch that I feel like it needs to. If someone were to ask me what the best episodes of the show were, I don't think that the movie would even be in the conversation.Put it on a watch list, it's still a very good laugh but it's a bit of a letdown compared to seasons 3-11 of the TV series.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
A drawn-out episode of the Simpsons,"I went to the theater with my 12 year old son to see this movie. We both went in rather excited and left underwhelmed.The movie had a few moments that made both of us laugh, and my son laughed at a few more things than I did, but unfortunately it was not enough to carry this movie for the duration.The wittiest jokes in the movie are actually part of the introduction. The MGM opening, Bart's writing on the chalkboard, and the part where all the people watching in the theater are called suckers (which looking back, resonates a bit more now).Whether or not it was intended this way, I think a character with Bart's personality, being punished and made to write that line on the chalkboard, is more of a stab at the MPAA, than a witty anti-piracy message.All in all, not a bad movie, not a great one either. Definitely better to wait for DVD and watch this where it belongs, on TV.",,Anonymous,Animation
Movie-making by committee,"Most of the jokes fell flat, as did most of the sentimental scenes. It was disjointed. But there were some nice action scenes, and it worked just enough to make me not sorry that I paid to see it on the big screen.Those are my impressions in a nutshell. More words? OK...There are really two big problems with The Simpsons Movie. The first, and more important one, is that it has no coherent, well-planned script. The creators apparently finished enough scenes which were eventually cut out to make a whole other film, and were removing and adding stuff until the last minute. This is a poor method of making sure that your film has a flow rather than simply a progression of events. Unfortunately, The Simpsons Movie's scenes often have no bridge between them, especially in the beginning, before the plot really gets going. One funny scene ends and another begins, and you get a weird sense that they could've switched their order around and no-one would've noticed. They're there more to show a joke than to fit into the bigger picture. Of course, this makes the plot not very coherent either. I really got the impression that any single 10-minute stretch of the movie could've been replaced with something completely different and still make as much sense as it did before.The second problem is that the movie makes some attempt at developing the Simpsons' characters and actually having a sort of moral. It only half-works, because you don't really get a sense that the Simpsons are real. In order for the comedy to work (which is the main focus of the film), many of the characters act like caricatures. It is therefor hard to relate to them when the film suddenly turns around and says ""nope, these folks are real, you're supposed to cry now"". The TV show has a similar problem. And, to be fair, so do some very fine comedy films like ""Hot Fuzz"".I should as well mention here that my theatre audience (Toronto, on a Tuesday a few weeks after the movie's premiere) was depressingly quiet, and there was only a bit of laughter. This seems to be one film which benefits greatly from being seen with an appreciative crowd. Unfortunately, after you take the appreciative crowd away, the film doesn't have enough merits to really be enjoyed by one person.Oh, it's alright. As I mentioned before, there are some really impressive action scenes, and some jokes actually DO work. But I think it's closer to being an ""ok"" movie than to being a ""good"" one.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Not my Doodle-Lee-Doodle Movie,"Let's be honest, cult series ""The Simpsons"" has been decreasing in quality as long as seasons grew higher. There has been a lot of more political innuendos, more toilet humor and less classy dialogs. Well, my five doesn't go to the movie itself but to the movie as a representation of the Simpsons to the Big Screen. If we go back to early Simspons, conflicts were simple dumb and hysterical, not complicated, neither multi-layered and not critical politically but sociologically. The charm that the family shared was based on wit and an amusing essence that was separated and appointed to each character: Homer is brainless exhilarating, Marge is the average caring mother, Lisa is the Voice of Reason, Bart is the Rebel we all have. Each has it's sharp connotation.But it seems Groening forgot that essence, that one that attracted youngsters and delighted adults. Some characters remain with the initial spark, yet Homer, Marge, Lisa and Bart seem exploited to fit into the Hollywood standards. It depraved it's natural beauty. Homer mainly. There's some unevenness in it's humor and mood that leaves me unsatisfied.Don't get me wrong, the movie is funny and if you choose brainless fun, not to take it too serious, it will contempt you. Yet, the addition of Nudity, desire of killings, gay people, politics, pork crap, cheap sentimentalism... The formula seems for a funny pot-humor Hollywood presentation, but the Simpsons are celestial.I had a nice laugh, but this series is sacred. You can't play with them. I enjoyed it, laughed, but I can't call it a good movie yet. Maybe it's the idea of the movie that was wrong. I find myself preferring to watch over and over again the episodes from the first seasons, where Groening wasn't yet affected by that growling Machine we call Hollywood.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation

Ten Years Too Late.,"Having been watching The Simpsons from its incarnation I did not know what to expect from this long overdue movie. Would it be the original, linear, character driven humour of the older episodes that could do no wrong or the fast moving, random, zany but ultimately empty episodes of the last five years. Unfortunately this film fell into the latter. I know it is all a matter of taste but for a Simpsons follower of well over a decade this movie wasn't even a patch on classic episodes through the beginning and middle seasons in particular. The main problem is the plot is ridiculous and implausible and there are just too many characters we all know and love to accommodate. To top this off the whole thing was so fast moving and random with too much stuff going on it seemed more like a sketch show than a satire. But having said this there were some funny sequences, not as much as I would have liked but some, lets face it when is The Simpsons never not funny! Its all just a shame that this wasn't made ten years ago, when The Simpsons was the best thing on television.6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Hilarious movie version of the show,"A lot of the stuff was familiar but still funny. The pig story reminded me of the lobster. The best thing about the movie was how they really made it cinematic and opened the town up and really made it look good. I liked the Disney interlude when all the animals come in and undress Marge and Homer. When Grandpa yells ""I'm part of the mob!"" was funny. The Green Day scene was really funny-sinking like the Titanic while playing violins. Albert Brooks gave one of his trademark great voice performances and the his conversations with the President among the highlights of the movie. Julie Kavner really did some of her best work ever as the voice of Marge. Grade A-",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Brings Back What Use To Make The Show Great!,"Awwww, the Simpsons. I can't remember a time when this show was not on. More importantly though I remember when the show was funny. During those days I was a die hard Simpson fan. To tree house horror episodes were we meet Kang and Kodus, to who shot Mr. Burns, or To when Crusty the clown was framed for armed robbery. Yes our yellow skinned friends have bin threw so much and I use to love every minute of it. Tragedy came when the writers began to run out of ideas and new ones took over that could not come up with well thought out humor. The show for me went down hill big time when Family Guy (still funny but A Simpson rip off) appeared. With its bizarre random styli of humor giving its key to success I notice the Simpson started trying to mimic it a little. Truth be told it was always better off having its well thought out plots, smart jokes and not to mention a real ending instead of just simply stopping. Fear not dear readers! This movie does indeed have an ending, a good one to, but you will be sad when it does come because you won't want this movie to end! This Film has every thing that made the Simpsons show a success. It has to be of one of the funniest movies I have seen in recent years.The story takes us back to the town of Springfield with the Simpson themed being played by Green Day. Any way Grandpa Simpson receives a vision from God for telling Springfield's horrible end. With the exception of Marge no one in the family seems to really care and thinks he's crazy. Including Grandpa himself! In the mean time Lisa has a new boy friend from Ireland who also really into preserving the environment. Together they attempt to get the town to clean up the local Lake. Bart is starting resent Homer for being really a lousy father. To his shock he starts to realize that he really likes there next door neighbor, Ned Flanders and wish Flanders was his father. Lisa unites the whole town to clean the lake perfectly and no ones allowed to dump anything in it. Homer however would break that rule. I will not say what he dumps into the lake but trust me it's gross. Anyway, the lake becomes so polluted because of Homer that it gets the attention of the United Sates Government. The Environmental Protection Agency seals the whole town in a glass dome because the place so badly polluted and no ones allowed to leave, ever. Thus Grandpa Simpson prophecy comes true! So now it's up to Homer to save the town he just doomed....Again.The Simpson movie will have you cracking up with laugher before the opening title appears. There are hysterical one liners threw out the film and catches the humor of the show before it went down hill. Pulse it nice to have a hand drawn film for a change. I was starting to forget what that looked like since every thing has to be CGI these days. They matured the humor a little for the big screen I notice. We have one scene were Homer gives people the finger and one moment involving Bart you may all know by now but I won't give it away just in case you have not seen the film. All your favorite characters are here. Chief Wiggim, Crusty the Clown, Moe, Upoo, Mr. Burns, Smithers, Ned Flanders, Barny, Fat Toney, Mole Man, Bumble Bee man, Comic Book Guy, Skinner, and of course Bart, Lisa, Maggie, Marge and Homer J. Simpson. We also get the voices of Green Day and Tom Hanks. Both making a brief but humors appearances.If your a died hard Simpsons fan then you have to see this movie. If you're like me and think the show has lost what made it so special you still have see this movie. It's a real treat. If you never heard of the Simpsons. First of all were have you bin? Seconded, still go see this movie because it's funny! That why I give The Simpson Movie a 10 out 10. WoooooooWhooooo!",,Anonymous,Animation
Simpsons Movie - Just Wasn't Very Good :(,"The film started out full of promise and was looking great for the first 20 minutes, then it just took a turn for the worse and ended up an average new simpsons episode, not even touching the brilliance that we saw 1990's.Highly disappointing and I actually considered leaving around an hour into the film. I don't know what to say really, it doesn't compare to the family guy movie and even the southpark film blows this out of the water.An average film if you go in with average expectations, but far from what you would expect the Simpsons Movie to be.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Legendary!,Truly one of the best movies of 2007. It may even be one of the best movies ever made.,10.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Not bad, but way too late","There's an advert doing the rounds in the UK Odeon cinema chain at the moment proudly proclaiming 2007 to be the best summer of movies ever. Having seen it several times, I'm beginning to think I might be getting too cynical to go and see films anymore, because so far this year I have ho-hummed my way through Spiderman 3, sat befuddled through Pirates 3, smirked occasionally during Shrek 3 and failed to see what the fuss was with Transformers. And now, having seen the Simpsons movie, it pains me to say it but the best thing I can bring myself to say is that it's okay. It's not outlandishly brilliant, or a complete disaster. It's just average is all. Six stars out of ten which passes an hour and a half quite nicely but doesn't leave you craving the DVD release. But, at least it's better than the Family Guy movie.On the plus side, the kids are going to love it. The screening I attended was packed out with ankle biters and they laughed every second, but for the seasoned Simpsons fanatics there is a definite sense of slight disappointment. The jokes are funny and the characters are as charming as ever, but it doesn't quite make the big enough leap to qualify as anything other than an extended TV episode. Sure, the animation is better and the colours sharper, but it's hard to shake the impression that it's merely an overlong TV script, knocked out quickly on a Friday afternoon so as to meet a deadline.The obvious comparison points would be the South Park and Family Guy movies. The Family Guy one was a disaster - three episodes strung together with no funny jokes and an overwhelming air of self satisfaction. The South Park movie meanwhile was terrific - it took the formula that made the show so great and amplified it to every extreme. The Simpsons movie falls somewhere between the two; it's still a step up, but ever since the series got increasingly outlandish, having Homer and co embark on an epic adventure to save Springfield isn't quite so dramatic anymore. If this had come out around the time of the eighth or ninth seasons when the show (arguably) was at its peak, it would have felt more like the event it always should have been.What's more, there's Homer. Let's be honest about Homer Simpson for a minute here, he's not that great a character anymore is he? He's crass, self-centred, bigoted, stupid and has so many mood shifts he's teetering on the brink of having multiple personalities. And in this film he's a complete jerk who becomes increasingly difficult to cheer on the more the plot develops. The lovable but dim-witted buffoon of the early series is now gone, replaced by a lumbering imbecile that sings an unfunny song about Spiderpigs.Considering how beloved the Simpsons are however, none of what I'm saying ultimately matters. It's going to make millions and keep on making millions and while it is occasionally so funny I was in pain, it still feels like a let down, probably because it overdoses on slapstick and a large number of jokes might as well consist of Matt Groening shouting: ""Look everybody! Homer Simpson is an idiot!"" It's okay, but sadly is just the latest average film in a summer that's overflowing with them. I really, really hope that The Bourne Ultimatum is incredible, or I'll have to give up on multiplex blockbusters and start going to independent cinemas, wear berets and take up chain smoking.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
As Expected... A Great 1.5 hr Episode of the Simpsons.,"The film was well worth waiting for. I have been an avid fan of the Simpson's since i was a kid. The series has been going on now much longer than i would have ever expected. It has brought my family together every Sunday at the same time every week to watch a new episode of what i would call the best series ever made. As everyone knows the Simpsons has brought upon the era of family entertainment, no other cartoon has ever had so much in common with a family of viewers from every continent in the world. I wont keep dragging on about how good the Simpson's are as a whole as you already know that. Unless your one of the very few who for some reason are insulted by some of the goings on (yes not very many people) but anyway about the film. I wasn't expecting an absolute cracker, i was just expecting a long episode of the Simpson's, and thats what i got and i got some great laughs out of it. Well worth watching as every episode would be.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Not my favorite movie, but definitely a great one","It's about time! The longest running animated show finally became a film. And if you were like me and anticipated it extremely, you'll feel let down. But just a little, for in my opinion it is more than just a long Simpsons episode. It has many memorable, funny aspects that only a movie could have. The main reason why I saw this is because I was curious at how they would turn this series into a movie, and I do not think that it could have been done better. Being as big of a Simpsons fan as I am, this is the movie that was worth waiting for. Without even having too much swearing, this is a film you will respect for being as good as it was without having too much innuendo. Joke-after-joke, they managed to make it a great movie along with being a feast of laughter.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
The Simpsons finally arrive!,"The Simpsons have been around ever since I could remember. We all grew up with Homer, Bart, Lisa Marge and Maggie. It was only a matter of time before these iconic characters would jump to the big screen. A lot of Simpson fans have waited for this moment. I was a huge Simpsons fan when I was younger but as I grew up the seasons decreased in entertainment in my opinion. Because the show for me didn't have that same appeal as it used to, I didn't think much when I heard the movie was coming. I finally started to hear good news like the old writers were coming back. The trailers that were released made me chuckle and I began to get excited. So what did I think of The Simpsons Movie? It was a solid good movie.The movie itself was kinda refreshing animation wise as all we get now are 3D animations. The Simpsons stuck with 2D and thats where this movie shines. It was so good to see a 2D animation back on the screen. The movie didn't feel long and boring. It was an hour and twenty seven minutes long I believe. Not once during the movie did I check the time or got bored. The Simpsons did what it used to do for me and thats ENTERTAIN!!!! Homer is the highlight of this movie and that's never a bad thing. Homer always makes you laugh especially with his new pig which was my favorite part of the movie. A lot of secondary characters don't get even a line in but that's OK we know who all these characters are, we don't need them on screen for the movie.One thing this movie does is, it highlight's a few emotional scenes which worked in some parts but didn't in some. When an emotional scene came up you felt for the characters because you know them, but the end result of the emotional impact falls dead in it's tracks.One thing did strike me watching the movie, this whole movie does not add anything new to The Simpson franchise. It doesn't necessarily do anything new for The Simpsons but one thing that stuck in my head on the way out, they should stop making Simpson season's on TV and release a movie once every two years. The movie was far more entertaining then any of the new episodes could ever be.Overall The Simpsons movie was funny, entertaining and I left with a smile on my face. It's downfall was the stupid end results of the emotional scenes which I kinda felt like they've done already on the show. The Simpsons is worth checking out, it's a solid good movie. I'd give this one a GO!",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Nothing to write home about, funny at times, a bit dry at others","Many people have been waiting for the Simpsons Movie to come out for nearly 10 years. Ever since the website was launched back in 1997 people have been anticipating the film to be released. Finally it was green lit and the Simpsons Movie was released on the 27th of July, 2007. I managed to see it opening night with a packed house, some even dressed as the Simpsons characters we have come to love. I must admit I never thought I'd watch the Simpsons with 300 people around me, let alone in a movie theater.The plot is pretty Simpson-like. Springfield has become a polluted city and the EPA (Environmental Protection Agency) decides to drop a massive dome on the city to prevent the pollution and the citizens from escaping the area, all with approval from President Schwarzenegger. Russ Cargill (Albert Brooks doing great voice acting again) is out to keep every Springfield citizen inside the dome no matter what. The Simpsons escape and become fugitives but begin to work on freeing Springfield from the evil Cargill and EPA.The voice acting is at its best. Dan Castellaneta, Julie Kavner, Nancy Cartwright, Harry Shearer, Hank Azaria and Yeardley Smith are all exceptional as the characters they have portrayed so long from the show. I did have a few problems with the characters in the film however. The film gives Bart more feelings then are usually customary for his brat-like attitude. He becomes to caring in the film and is less funny then usual. Now Homer is ten times funnier then I have seen him in the past 5 seasons of the Simpsons. Marge and Lisa are still their normal selves. A few characters are all but cut from the film including: Principal Skinner, Mrs. Krabappel, and Mole Man.The flow of the film is a bit bad. They'll be a stretch of 10 minutes without a laugh then a bunch of laughs in another stretch. I felt they could have spread out the jokes a little more, especially toward the end of the film when there seemed to be far fewer jokes then in the first half hour. Most of the jokes are Simpson-like: easy to understand, low blows, and a bit of slapstick. A few jokes will have you on the floor crying they are that funny while others you may be like ""wtf?"" Though that only happened twice for me. However the jokes are way better then what have been on TV for the past few seasons.A few downsides was that I believe the people making this felt that had to include as many characters as they possibly could. For no apparent reason some characters just show up, say something, then aren't seen the rest of the film. I didn't think that was really necessary. Mr. Burns and Smithers should have been used way more then just the two scenes they were in. Also I felt the need for celebrities to make guest appearances, while a part of the shows storied history, was also unneeded. I saw nothing funny about Tom Hanks appearing for a scene as well as Green Day being in the opening scene of the film which gets things flowing. I felt The Simpsons Movie was wasting precious minutes they could have put to more funny things (though when the barge Green Day is on begins to sink and the band members begin to play violins reminiscent of the scene from Titanic, I did laugh).Overall, I would not call The Simpsons Movie by any means a waste of time. Fans of the show will love it as I did. There were some stretched out, overall boring scenes that could have been shortened but the comedy made up for most of it. I can honestly say it is the funniest I've seen Homer since 1998. It's well worth a visit to the local movie theater. There ain't too much language, there's a lot of laughs and I think it will give anyone who is a fan of the show a good time though some may be disappointed for the reasons I stated above.3/5 stars",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
An 87 minute episode.,"Feature-length adventure of the greatest animated family ever. Homer pollutes Lake Springfield, causing the EPA to enclose Springfield in a large glass dome. When Homer and his family escape through a sinkhole and aren't wanted back by the residence, the Simpsons head north to start anew in Alaska. Higher quality than the majority of what the show offered after 2001, but still nothing close to the first 10 or even 12 seasons. Offers an interesting plot and plenty of worthy laughs, but one can't help but gripe when the movie is really nothing more than an inflated episode on an inflated screen.

Super Size This!,"It's hard to believe it's been almost twenty years since ""The Simpsons"" first entered our homes. Over the years we've seen the emergence of cartoons more scathingly satirical (""South Park"") and more randomly ridiculous (""Family Guy""), but ""The Simpsons"" has always kept chugging along. While it's been well past its prime for almost a decade now (oh, how we miss the Conan O'Brien years), Matt Groening and his team have decided to fire on all cylinders for the first foray onto the big screen. Staying true to its form and not trying anything too daring, ""The Simpsons Movie"" is essentially a super-sized 90 minute episode.The plot of this film is a rehash of the standard ""Homer does something completely idiotic and selfish and gets all of Springfield in trouble and makes Marge hopping mad."" There's plenty of homages to some of the past great episodes (Jumping Springfield Gorge, Bart Becomes a Flanders), and all the characters are doing their classic shtick. Chief Wiggum almost shooting himself while eating free donuts that have been stacked on the barrel of his gun is especially funny. Most of the hearty laughs are found in the peripherals. ""The Simpsons"" has never been accused of being subtle--witness here a literal visual depiction of Homer being stuck between ""a rock and hard place."" Always gently poking fun at religion (the stuff with Grandpa in church is priceless), politics (here we see Arnold as President), lampooning pop culture (Homer playing ""Grand Theft Walrus"" in Alaska is a joke about five years too late but still laugh-out-loud funny), and most successfully taking sharp jabs at itself and its corporate sponsors, the film delivers plenty of sight gags and one-liners to please even the most casual of fans.As the ""Comic Book Guy"" might point out, this isn't exactly ""The Greatest Episode Ever,"" but it packs in more chuckles per minute than anything I've seen on the big or small screen this year.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
The King's Muted Jester,"I don't do TeeVee, so my encounters with these are either through reader recommendations, the usual case, or when something has a movie theater incarnation. I wasn't aware of the great controversy about the genuineness of ""The Simpsons"" versus ""South Park."" I do know that when I watched that South Park movie and several of the episodes, I was impressed, I often laughed and I wasn't ashamed of why. It was the sort of humor that is clever and that allows you to share in its cleverness.This isn't clever in the big. In fact, it follows a Disney-inspired template: an unworthy man is redeemed, a boy reunites with his father. And this in the safest of Disney messages: give a hoot, and the government is evil. Noticeably absent is any business about media companies with huge budgets being evil. There used to be a bunch of this, I think: clowns and cartoons, dumping on TeeVee cartoons and cynical, manufactured humor.There used to be winks at the audience, a sort of: ""this is a bit going after a stupid, trailer park laugh, and the funny thing about it will be the fact that we are doing it with both of us knowing it."" Somewhere along the way, the show became a brand and when that happens you do everything you can to support the brand. Things like taking over convenience stores for advertising purposes. Would the early incarnation of this start with Bart writing ""don't illegally download?"" Would ""South Park?""This isn't ""The Simpsons"" any more; its ""The Flintstones."" It has become trailerpark without the wink.Ted's Evaluation -- 1 of 3: You can find something better to do with this part of your life.",,Anonymous,Animation
entertaining on different levels but really plays like a long TV episode,"The movie was fun and packed with laughs particularly in the first 20 or so minutes and is easily one of the funnier Simpsons stories.The humor is easily aimed at teenagers and up although in Australia, the movie has been given a PG rating which I found quite surprising given some of the adult themes which are scattered throughout the movie.The storyline is interesting and implausible as you would expect, the only thing it really lacks is something to differentiate itself from the TV episodes.

Everyone has been waiting eighteen years for this.,"But it should have been done a long time ago when The Simpsons was in its prime. I came to the cinema today expecting to see an extended version of the current runnings of the TV series and I left with the same impression.Obviously The Simpsons is a sit-com that can entertain all ages of the audience and so it attracted a broad range of fans to the preview, spanning from eight to fifty-year old's. And I understood from that screening that the audience over reactive to the gags in the film. Although they weren't as funny as they supposed to be, the audience still laughed because of the passion of The Simpsons; during some of the jokes that were displayed in the film, immediately the audience laughed out loud over it. They all knew it wasn't a classic gag that would go down in the history books, but they laughed because it was The Simpsons and it goes to show that the series has earned such a huge portion of respect from the fans. And it makes everyone realise that it's not just one episode that makes The Simpsons great, it's the amount of episodes that defines the franchise; there's an episode for every member of the audience in terms of genre and this film basically just summed up all the aspects from the past two decades into one 90 minute viewing.In the end, I'll have to say; it wasn't the best (feature length) episode I've ever seen from the Groening brigade, but it had some funny moments that were only suitable for the cinema experience. I would say to you all to go and watch it and find your own opinion on it. It does better than the new television episodes but it's lost the spirit of the old classic's.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
This Is The Best Movie Ever!,"I loved this film!I could make no sense of what was going to happen from the trailers and and couldn't see how they were going to fit all of that stuff into 90 minutes. But they did.I saw this with several on its first showing at my cinema with a dozen of my friends who are all aged between 14 and 15 and a theatre full of 7 year old on a day trip but its safe to say we laughed a hell of a lot more than they did. The film got a PG rating by the skin of its teeth in my opinion due to the sex references and violence (especially the Itchy and Scratchy Movie at the start.)I don't care is it isn't suitable for a family trip out. This film is perfect for an older audience and thats what the Simpson's should be for 10 year old's and over.I was slightly disappointed that some of the greatest one episode characters didn't show up e.g Kang and Kodos, Hank Scorpio and The father and son carnies (who's names escape me.) i also thought that Spider-Pig should have had a MUCH bigger part.So to sum up: See this film if: -You like the Simpson's -You are over 10 -You don't want to be known as 'The Guy That Missed The Simsons Movie'Bring on the Sequel!",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Give me three Golden Era episodes,"I went into the cinema with low expectations and came out feeling the same.As most would know, The Simpsons have been declining in quality for close to ten years now. The Simpsons have relied more and more on slapstick and physical humor over recent years, instead of the witty and clever humor that made The Simpsons what it is today.The lack of sub-plots and incredibly low use of established and popular characters describes this movie. The movie simply follows The Simpson family throughout their journey for the most part, with nothing much else really happening. The movie also fails to bring in established characters for more vital and lengthy roles, thus giving it a plain and predictable feel.To say this movie is hilarious, is an exaggeration of mammoth proportions. The returning of some of the old writers is noticeable at times, but their efforts prove to be in vain as the overall style of the movie is in the modern Simpsons fashion.Although there are good jokes peppered throughout the movie, they are sadly outnumbered by the more crude and dare i say ""dumb"" jokes.Many Simpsons fans may feel the need to rate this movie extremely high, but this movie is nowhere near being a classic and has come around ten years too late.As a huge Simpsons fan myself, i am devastated that The Simpsons has become a slapstick and ordinary show. This movie is simply an above average version of that. A 7/10, but only because it is The Simpsons. A good movie, nothing more.Three Golden Era episodes all back to back, will make for a much more entertaining time.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
South Park Already Did It.,"Funny how long we had to wait to finally watch the Simpsons' family on the big screen : whereas all the TV shows have now extremely rapidly their own movie adaptation (including ""South Park"" after only two seasons), Matt Groening waited almost twenty years (his yellow family first appeared in ""The Tracey Ullman Show"" in 1987 !) to bring us ""The Simpsons Movie"". And hopefully, it was worth the waiting.At the beginning of the movie, Homer Simpson yell at the ""Itchy and Scratchy Movie"" screening he went to see with his family : ""Why do we have to pay to watch something we can get for free on TV ?"". Well, like Kramer once said in a ""Seinfeld"" episode : ""Why going in a four stars restaurant while you can eat all by yourself cheat pasta in your apartment ? Why riding horses on LSD while you can sleep peacefully in your bed ?"". ""The Simpsons Movie"" is nevertheless bigger, larger and uncut compared to a twenty minutes episode, but the script compiles the best jokes ""The Simpsons"" could offer without a pause, when the direction of the movie, assured by David ""Monster, Inc."" Silverman is a real cinema one and looks technically very impressive on the big screen : so, no matter what, ""The Simpsons Movie"" is a real theater experience.But the great achievement of the movie is to look both original and sincere and true to the spirit of the show : it almost looks like a ""best of"", but only with new materials. The movie is for instance, like the show, very clever and subversive in its jokes and details (the appearance of President Arnold Schwarzenegger, the Al Gore's movie parody, etc.) but ultimately very conformist and American in its moral and ending (the family is the most important thing in the world). And it's certainly this mixture of conformism in the subversion that allowed the show its wide audience and its worldwide success. The critic is here, but tempered by the message and morality of the movie.All this will certainly pleased the Simpson's fans, or people like me, how lost their tracks years ago and are very happy to see that Homer is still inconstant and stupid or Mr. Burns still rich and mean. It almost make me want to take a look at the last season, and sure make me wait for, like Maggie said, a ""sequel"".",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Disappointing if you're a fan from the earlier years of the show.,"Let me start this review by saying that when ""The Simpsons"" was at its best it was quite possibly the best show on television. It was clever, funny, sarcastic without coming off as too mean-spirited, and it had a lot of heart. Unfortunately, that was about ten years ago. About halfway through the show's nearly two-decade run it kind of went on a downward spiral from which it has yet to recover. The episode plots started to make less and less sense, the jokes got dumber, and much of the heartfelt sentiment that was part of the best episodes seemed to disappear. In fact, the show that exists now seems to be entirely different from the show I grew up watching. It still has its moments, but for the most part it just isn't the same. If ""The Simpsons Movie"" came out ten years ago and was based on what the show was in its earlier years, I can guarantee that it would've been better than just about any other movie to come out that year. Sadly, what we have now is a movie based on the ""new"" show, the show that often favors cheap laughs over the cleverness of the ""old"" show's glory days.That's not to say that this movie is a total waste of time. Although I don't think I can recommend this one as much more than a DVD rental or a Saturday afternoon matinée, there was still quite a bit that I did like. There's quite a bit of sharp social commentary about the average American idiot's complete disregard for the environment (the average American idiot is, of course, represented by Homer) as well as the untrustworthiness of our government. There is also some surprisingly touching and emotional subplots that pop up, such as an uncharacteristically lonely Bart looking to Ned Flanders as a father figure, and Homer facing the fact that Marge just might leave him for good (it's a subject that has been handled many times on the show, but it's never seemed quite as sad as it is here). Homer proves once again why he's such a memorable character as well. It's still nearly impossible not to laugh at him, and despite his idiocy and selfishness he proves that deep down he cares more about his family than anything else.As much as there was for me to like about this movie, there was still a lot that I found kind of annoying. It's hard to explain why, but the script itself feels a little slapdash for my tastes. We don't get into the main plot until about a half-hour, and until then the film seems to consist of a bunch random jokes and general weirdness that feel like they're very loosely tied together. When we do get to the main plot (in which Homer practically single-handedly pollutes Springfield so badly that the corrupt head of the Environmental Protection Agency seals the town inside a gigantic glass dome) it's almost too outlandish even for a Simpsons movie. The movie also seems to go over everything a little too quickly, and as a result some of the more interesting and emotional subplots seem to be short-changed at times in favor of jokes that for the most part aren't nearly as good as the best that the television show had to offer.While I didn't hate this movie, I have to admit that it was kind of a disappointment to folks like myself who think that the best days of ""The Simpsons"" are long gone. If given a choice between watching this movie and watching a marathon of ""Simpsons"" episodes from the first seven or eight seasons, I'd pick the marathon anytime.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
thumbs up,"From a huge Simpsons fan I would recommend this movie. It was funny and there was plenty of all the humor that we come to expect from the Simpsons. There were plenty of cameos from old characters that you could barely be seen as a camera passed through a crowd, but a lot of people show up. It was basically just a really long episode, but much funnier and more time for stupidity from Homer and a lot more room for jokes. I also would tell people to stay for the credits. A few moments were ruined a little bit by the previews, but not to the level where it ruins it at all. There is not much to say about this movie except it is the Simpsons that we have grown to love back in all of their glory.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

The only thing wrong was it was to short, 18 years in the making and all they got was 89 minutes. The actors delivered on the voices as well if not better then in the seasons.

The Simpsons you pay for,"Why a movie-length Simpsons? No doubt money had something to do with it (this film has grossed $US 125 million in the US alone in three weeks). The huge team of writers have not taken the opportunity to do much different from the usual string of gags, sight and otherwise, delivered at breakneck speed. There is a rather mawkish re-affirmation of ""family values"", but then the Simpsons have always had a sentimental streak. When it comes to authority, subversiveness comes to the fore - the US Environmental Protection Agency will not be urging people to see the film  though small government advocates might.The sets and crowd scenes are a little more elaborate than those in a standard TV episode; the Alaska scenes are quite beautiful. Although the writers have produced witty and intelligent stuff they stop short of anything that might offend any sizeable portion of their audience. Religious belief is an example. Homer is not the fervent believer that Ned Flanders is, but he goes to church nonetheless. Casting a lovable central character as an atheist is simply not acceptable on US television.Lots of the secondary characters get a gig, but often a very short one. Baby Maggie gets to utter her first word, right at the end, in the credits, which, by the way, are just about the longest in cinema history and include a sizeable portion of the population of Korea, where much of the animation work was done. If you like the Simpson on TV you'll like the film, but it goes no further than an above average TV episode.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

Just saw the movie tonight and while it was a thrill to see The Simpsons on the big screen and in a movie length feature, it was good but not great.It had it's moments but there were also parts that were rather weak I thought. It's like they were overwhelmed with what to do with all that extra time. It lost a lot of character because the ""characters"" (the various faces of Springfield) just weren't very deep. We only saw a small percentage of the characters that make up Springfield and not much focus on them.Would I buy the DVD when it's released? Absolutely.

Mediocre... doesn't deserve all the high praise!,"I know there's a hardcore fan base out there for The Simpons, but I couldn't help but feel that maybe this would've been better as a made for TV movie.

This was mediocre at best bordering on being tedious in some places (spider pig! Need I say more?). I'm a huge fan of the earlier episodes, which had some really excellent stories that dealt with real problems in a unique and entertaining way. However, watching this only reminded me of the more recent Simpson's episodes which tend to use shock value and tried and tested gags to achieve laughs that can now only be found in the earlier episodes. Deserves 5/10 watch Order of the Phoenix for a really entertaining cinema experience!",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Good, but not as good as the old TV show","Now, I am a fan of the old ones. Not the new ones, but the old ones. But when it comes to a film, almost all jokes and plot have to be similar. That's what best describes this movie. The plot can be strong, like how the people are trapped in a dome, but the humor of it all is like your average episode of the Simpsons. The jokes are mostly good, too. The animation is pretty decent-good, and the character design has improved, but it looks too perfect. Now the developed characters probably have to be Bart and Homer, but the rest is either a comedy relief, a family member that's there since its a Simpsons movie (Lisa, Maggie and Marge.) Now Marge does make Homer change his mind, but she's not very developed and sure Lisa is helping the town, but neither is she. The villain, Russ Cargill is kind of threatening, but in a humorous way and he could've been used better.So overall, this is a hit and it's good, but it could've been better. I'd actually like the show to end now that it's stale, but they should make another movie. The story is pretty dumb, but so dumb it's funny. This is probably one of the last Simpson thing that kept the good quality. So if you're a fan, this is the film for you, especially if you're a fan of the new ones.Story: 7/10 Animation: 6.5/10 Characters: 6/10 Overall, 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
About  Simpsons movie,"I just saw the movie and after years of waiting for a movie based on one of my favorite shows, I was eagerly exited about finally seeing it. I don't often see a movie on the first day, but not only did I see it on the first day. I was 4th in line at the very first showing at this Toronto theatre. Well, after waiting about 15 years, I finally saw it and let me tell you, it was definitely worth the wait. I would have to compare this film to the best cartoon movies of all time. The last really good cartoon movie was South Park, but the animation isn't quite as good as the Simpsons. I compare this more to Roger Rabbit, which had great animation, a great story and humor too. Not only do they parody not only their own show, but other cartoons like Disney, which I have never been much of a fan of. This is a movie that has to be seen on a big screen, not on a DVD or TV. The animation is almost 3 dimensional in some scenes and I have to admit, the look is a little different from the regular show. The movie has a bit of a different look. Fans of the show will notice this. The movie moves quickly and there are lots laughs and entertainment from the very beginning to the very end. Do not leave this movie until the curtain is closed. This movie is a masterpiece and if there is another one, I'll surely be there. I am fortunate to live in a time to witness this event. I really call this movie an event. It's not just a movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
I Like My Simpsons in 1/2 Hour Increments,"Like I said about another T. V. cartoon turned movie: T. V. shows don't usually translate well into feature length films. I like ""The Simpsons"" at a half hour for my beginning, middle, and end; my introduction, conflict, and resolution. As an hour plus movie Homer isn't as funny, nor are all the other characters.Homer got the entire city of Springfield put under a dome after dumping pig waste into the Springfield lake. Apparently, the government considered Springfield so toxic the entire city had to be contained. As always, Homer was a screw up, but if he can do one right thing maybe he can be forgiven.""The Simpsons Movie"" was a nice try and it could've been a lot worse, just don't do it again.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
"""awesome if you are not a simpsons fan.""","I'm not a simpsons fan. and i decided to see the movie after a friend of mine told me about it. he told me that the movie is awesome for non-simpson fans, be he told me if you like the show you'll be somehow disappointed. so i gave it a shot. and yes it was amazing. it was a mindless comedy. it's mainly about the witty and mainly stupid homer polluting the town lake which causes Springfield, the simpsons' hometown, to be secluded from the rest of U.S.for a movie based off of a series, the simpsons movie is great. although I'm not a simpsons fan, i had the opportunity to see a couple of episodes. and the movie and the show basically have the same kind of humor, homer messes something up and he has to fix it.my advice for you movie goers is buy the DVD, it'll be a money well spent, and a good hour and a half.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
A pleasant surprise for this fan of 20 years.,"When ""The Simpsons Movie"" was announced, it raised my interest, even though I had pretty much given up on the weekly show, which should have retired with the 20th century. The trailers I saw did not appeal to me at all. Still, I decided that I would give the film a try, IF it got decent reviews from fans and/or critics. A few hours into the weekend, I convinced myself to go, with no expectations, and hoped that it wouldn't be a total wreck of a film. Boy was I surprised.""The Simpsons Movie"" is a funny, smart, and endearing flick that left me with a sense of giddy satisfaction that I haven't felt since the show's heyday in the 90's. It revolves around a fairly simple story(that gets increasingly elaborate,) held together by perfect characterizations and lots of humor.There's something about seeing a comedy on the big screen that makes it so much more fun. ""Simpsons"" offers a diverse comical dish that includes broad slapstick, satire, irony, social commentary and good old fashioned madcap cartoon shenanigans. The jokes work more often than not, and there's enough humor to evoke steady laughs and smiles. Even the gags that seemed overly silly in the trailer (I'm thinking specifically of the Rock and a Hard Place sequence) worked well in front of a diverse audience of hundreds. (In retrospect, I wonder if the rock/hard place gag was not meant to be more of a isolated set piece rather than literal action that takes place in ""real time."" Hmm...) The film takes some risks , including a few sight gags and jokes that would not make into Fox's prime time lineup, but it also seems strangely...sterilized at times. Suicide jokes, middle fingers and animated ""doodles"" aside, I was still left with the feeling that the creators held back in some ways, more than they would have even on the small screen. Something about the film seems edited, even incomplete in some spots. On the other hand, I'm glad they didn't go too far. As crude as it can be at times, The Simpsons franchise has always maintained a certain level of class and good nature. Shows like South Park and Family Guy would not exist without ""The Simpsons,"" yet their brand of comedy does not suit Matt Groening's classic.The most surprising aspect of ""The Simpsons Movie"" is its genuine heart, an element that has been missing from the series for nearly a decade. There are some truly sweet moments in the film, and the script, along with fine animation and excellent voice work, helps to create some interesting character nuances that I don't think I've ever seen before. For the first time since I was a child, I actually cared about what happened to the Simpson clan and the citizens of Springfield. Bart and Lisa were real, believable kids, without losing their distinct edge. Maggie was used well for comic relief. Marge was perhaps the most well-developed character in the film. But I was most impressed with the handling of Homer. Throughout the history of the series, Homer has gone from temperamental disciplinarian, to passive but disgruntled father, to lazy but lovable oaf, to irrational idiot, to town whipping boy and finally to, well, to complete a**hole. All of these elements are present in the film, but they are slowly stripped away, and for a few fleeting moments, the audience is able to see a real person, flawed but kind-hearted, and ready to accept responsibility. Will this ""new"" Homer last? Only time(or a sequel) will tell. Remember, this is the same guy who survived death and disaster on many occasions throughout the series, and made many a vow of change, only to revert immediately(and comically) back to his old ways.The animation is excellent, and its heartening to see a return to hand drawn work, even with the incorporation of some CGI. The combination of styles works nicely to produce a few cool visual sequences.The soundtrack consists of a pleasant incidental score and a rock version of the main theme, performed by Green Day. Perhaps the most memorable piece of music is the use of Marge and Homer's ""theme"" (the Carpenters' ""Close to You."") Overall, it's a bit sparse musically, but as with the boundary-pushing gags, less may be better than too much. Still, I wouldn't have minded the town of Springfield breaking into spontaneous song, at least once.Its rare that I can say this about a modern film, but at 87 minutes, I felt that ""Simpsons"" was too short! An extra 20 minutes or so would have allowed for further plot development , and some of the issues left up in the air as the credits rolled could have been better resolved.""The Simpson Movie"" has something for every type of fan, and even something for non fans. If I were to compare the film to the progression of the series, I'd say the humor is of late-90's-era quality (a little broader and zanier than ""classic"" Simpsons humor , but still solid and clever.) The story and direction, however, remind me of something from the earliest season(s) of the show, with steady pacing, blatant morality, and character-driven plot. This movie is not for very young children (I wouldn't take any kid under 11 or so.) If you don't like or cannot appreciate subverted and ""irreverent"" humor, this may not be the film for you. But if you've ever enjoyed the the Simpsons family, you will enjoy ""The Simpsons Movie.""",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Hmmm...,"In general this really isn't a bad film, it's nice to get a feature length episode to be honest.The only thing is; imagine if this was made back in the glory days with that team of writers, it could of been one of the best animated films ever.But as we can't all think about what could of been, we at least have this and it's a decent feature length episode, probably better than the normal episodes that were being released at the time.I have to admit I prefer the Futurama feature length episodes (although Futurama is my joint favourite cartoon, tied with South Park). I would of preferred a proper Futurama film in 2008 and the Simpsons movie 10 years earlier.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
The Funniest Movie of the Summer,"After 18 seasons on television, the Simpsons could have been an average product and it still would have drawn a big audience from it's loyal fans. The makers put a lot of heart and effort into the feature film to add new life, new jokes and a lot of laughter. The movie was refreshing and fun from the beginning shot to the end. Homer was hilarious at every turn and this cartoon character was more impressive than any feature film actor in this summer season of movies. Each family member had their moments and provided wonderful lines, humor and events that made The Simpson Movie a precious gem in a summer of bad movies. I would highly recommend this movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

Funny but nothing special,"Yep...it was funny, no doubt about it...however there was really nothing else to be honest. For years people had debated about this film...Will they do something new? or will they just regurgitate a longer version of the TV series. The answer is very much the latter although of course the plot was a lot more ambitious than the typical TV episode.Pretty much this means that it was nothing special as entertainment and really will be remembered for the ridiculous amount of money this film has grossed however that does not mean it was a bad film. It was funny and sometimes even witty and definitely an improvement on the latest incarnations on TV...although some of it was just random...All in all the Simpsons movie delivered for the masses what they probably were expecting, a funny, often hilarious 75 minute TV episode, which unfortunately branched out little from the 20 minute showings so many of us have come to love...",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
"A sheer joy, series essence is perfectly captured.","After twenty years awaiting its arrival 'The Simpsons Movie' is finally here! It is one of the few cartoon movies made nowadays since computer animation came in. A very entertaining feature length adventure that while Homer, Bart, Lisa Maggie and Marge are seen as the central characters every single Simpsons character there is makes an appearance. We also see Colin,  Lisa's Irish boyfriend who shares her desire to stop pollution  the persistent head of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and Tom Hanks. Staying true to the ridicule of the television series it explores more emotional and serious issues. Such as Springfield being cut off from the rest of the world and Mr. and Mrs. Simpsons' marriage ending, both because of Homer. We also find a close father-son relationship between Ned Flanders and Bart. Stay for the whole of the credits because the entertainment doesn't stop there.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Recommended,"'THE SIMPSONS MOVIE' - 2007Directed by David Silverman{Directorial Debut}Starring Dan Castellaneta{The Pursuit of Happiness; The Cat in the Hat}, Nancy Cartwright{The Little Mermaid; Rugrats Go Wild} and Julie Kavner{Doctor Dolitle; Click}.Plot Overview: After Springfield becomes the most polluted city in the USA, government employee Russ Cargill(Albert Brooks{Finding Nemo; Lost in America}) decided to place a large dome around Springfield, trapping the inhabitants. When the townsfolk uncover that it was Homer(Dan Castellaneta) who sentenced them to this fate, Homer and co must flee Springfield and try to evade the government.It would probably be fitting for me to voice my thoughts on the show before I review this film. I don't mind the show. I think that I respect it more than I like it. It did a lot to Television, namely animated shows so I highly commend it for what it contributed to entertainment. But as a show, I think it's fine. And as a whole, I think this movie is fine also. I liked it. I don't think it even holds a candle to South Park BL&U(if comparisons are gonna annoy you then you may wish to turn back now) but it succeeds as a family friendly piece of entertainment. Which is what The Simpsons has always been.What things did I like about this movie, for a start. Similar to the TV show, the voice acting is great. Dan Castellaneta does a great job at voicing all his roles, particularly Homer and Grandpa. Nancy Cartwright voiced my favourite character from the show, Bart, and does it excellently. She also voiced a couple other characters but Bart is her main piece of meat to play with. Julie Kavner was great at voicing Marge as well as others. I thought that every voice actor did a good job and provided a decent amount of range for all the characters.Another thing that I can praise highly is the animation and cinematography. Having a bigger budget(I presume) would definitely give them greater freedom to make the animation stand out and they certainly did that. 'The Simpsons Movie' looks great from an animation standpoint, and even the cinematography/editing are great too. It is a very nice looking movie.And now there is something that may sound controversial but hear me out. I don't find The Simpsons funny. It's never been my style of comedy. It's fine for what it is but I really don't think it's this titan of comedic genius that many people claim it as. It's fine. That's were it begins and ends for me. It is fine. That is also a similar opinion to the comedy in this movie. I think the longer run time probably helped because there was more time to pack in jokes and gags, and quite a few of them did hit for me. Few of the jokes definitively FAILED but by the same merit virtually none made me laugh out loud. I smiled consistently and once or twice elicited a mild chuckle but there wasn't really a point that I fully lost control and laughed.And now for some issues! Yay! I cannot stand their attempt at satire. Similarly to how BL&U tried to satirise censorship and people's backwards opinion on what is and isn't allowed, The Simpsons Movie tries to satirise the US government's inability to do anything remotely useful. I really don't see the point in doing this. Maybe a simple moral or two here or there but basing the ENTIRE plot of the movie on this intricate attempt at a 'BRILLIANT!' satire just didn't work. BL&U did this excellently, but then again that was what South Park was known for. Mocking culture, religion, law and politics. The Simpsons has always been, as far as I know, a basic family show that is fun to watch, so their dry attempt at getting into the 'greater meaning' game was rather pointless and stupid, in my honest opinion.I was also annoyed at certain things to do with charters. Firstly, all the 'good' non-main characters were COMPLETELY sidelined. Flanders barely has a role, Krusty doesn't, Ralph Wiggum doesn't, Willie doesn't, Millhouse doesn't, Mr Burns doesn't. Instead, we get a very dull and uninteresting antagonist, and an Irish twerp. Colin was a very uninteresting love interest for Lisa and I seriously do not understand what role he actually played in this movie. And then there is the villain; he was SUCH a disappointment. He wasn't funny, he wasn't smart; his one and only role was to satirise the government, and even then he failed miserably. The GOOD characters we all know and love should have remained, and in doing so drop the utterly ridiculous satire of the government. I really like the dome idea but maybe have Mr Burns or someone do it and make him go FULL evil. That'd be funny, or even do a mild mannered character and make them snap. That'd be funny. But no. We get a very boring story about how the government is evil and useless(I'm not disagreeing with that statement but it didn't need to be in The Simpsons).As a whole, I do like this movie. It's fun and entertaining to an extent but it does lack a solid villain and plot, as well as some of the best characters in the show. But, if you do like the show, I can recommend it. A fair percent of the jokes hit and it's by now means a chore to sit through. But the flaws do really stand out, for me at least. Despite this, I recommend this film. I'll rate 'The Simpsons Movie' 7 'Spiderpigs' out of 10!",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
That's not my Simpsons! That's not my Simpsons!!!,"I never thought the television series would have strayed so far away from itself, but The Simpsons Movie goes to prove it has. I have a feeling that deep down inside the producers of this film somewhat knew they were going to make a terrible film that would sweep the box offices pronto, and it did. 74 million on the opening weekend in the USA. Of course people are going to see it, it's the Simpson's Movie! The Simpson's, the classic television series that defines a portion of our modern generation. When one quotes the Simpson's, everyone knows where it is from, at least, in our age group. This movie however has strayed so far away from the real Simpson's that it's as thought it doesn't know its own self anymore. You compare this film to the original early 90's episodes and there is a lot of stupidity, character change, dumb humor and so on.Remember when you came home and watched the Simpson's in the afternoon like everyone else in the 90s? You'd be fed amazing subject matter, themes, and messages week after week, time after time, and this subject matter was made into witty intelligent humor that striked out a message to your average modern day dysfunctional family. The Simpson's was so relatable to almost everyone who watched it. For an example: when Bart enters the golf putty tournament and Homer pressures him into it, it was so relatable to so many people but in the end it would clean up with Homer and Flanders wearing their wives dresses mowing their lawns. Something serious with a punch of humor, which was what the Simpson's, was all about. The episode where Bart and Lisa fight over Bart destroying Lisa's thanks giving ornament and Bart runs away from home yet only to return to his family who loves him dearly despite all the fighting and such. This was it! This was the Simpson's that everyone loved!Week after week people would never get upset over their loved television show involving Homer strangling Bart, Homer falling down the stairs, Lisa giving out some intelligent remark only to be ignored by her family, Marge groaning or Maggie falling over her dress. If you pay attention, this is all disappearing in the new episodesas sad as it is, but our lovable characters are being disfigured into something and someone else. Look at Bart in the film for an example, Bart is upset because his dad isn't enough of a father figure, therefore he turns to the Flanders family?!?! Bart, the boy struggling at school and the boy who has the sling shot in his back pocket, is a trouble maker! He doesn't want a father figure! Not only the enormous change of characters has been happening, but far fetched, random, Family Guy-esquire humor has been occurring in the Simpson's, when shouldn't the Simpson's stay as the Simpson's and not turn into something its not, Family Guy?There's some really terrible jokes in this film too. Homer pours a silo of pig excrement into a lake so it mutates animals? Yeahokaythat's realistic and funnyand the spider pig joke, people, it isn't funny!! This movie just goes to prove that the producers shove the Simpson's on our plates and we gobble it up laughing our heads off because it's the Simpson's in the 21st century, now they can do anything they want because they were defined enough in the 90's! No! I'm sick to death of the Simpson's going to foreign countries and encountering some danger or misfortune along the way that winds them up in some absolute ridiculous situation – ending up on a game show, discovering a diamond mine topped with monkey slaves. Its stuff like this that the producer's are clearly saying ""We have run out of ideasyou're on your own!""Its sad when you look at the classic Simpson's and then look at the modern times of the Simpson's, and you'll see that its all going down the drain, that the ""dumb"" shows are being shown over and over and the classic ones which I have mentioned are being pushed into oblivion aka Sunday afternoons. Another thing, Futurama's film is being released direct to video? Futurama should be the new Simpson's in all honesty, its loaded, and I mean loaded, with tonnes of emotional episodes, characters and its actually pure genius! Shame what they've done to the Simpson's, it truly is",1.0,Anonymous,Animation

One of the everything collapses but goes back to order by the end episodes stretched to a movie.,"The production values are greatly above the show, and there are a couple grander shots, but at its heart it's essentially a modern Simpsons episode of the better kind stretched out, with many gags planted throughout. These gags are more or less thoroughly tested, so just a couple misfire (unlike the show), and even those i presume are funny to somebody else, just not me. The strangest i personally found was the GTA parody in the form of Grand Theft Walrus in the Alaskan arcade, named that way i guess just to be able to kick into the Happy Feet fad through shooting a jumping from joy penguin. But if you ask me it came off strange, and unworthy just for that, should have been Grand Theft Sled or just forgot about entirely. I also don't really get one of the key components to the story, what the hell is that hole that Maggie slips in and out, even under the dome? Not a very well re-watchable movie, but decent. If they ever do an other one, it must be a tad better at least, or don't even bother.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
"By its very nature, what we've been waiting for. It delivers as well as it can.","Here's what I think: a good portion of the world has waited for a long time to see the Simpsons on the theatre screen. This kind of anticipation for a film has no precedent, as far as I know. It's absolutely huge. The logical, human extension of this anticipation is that many people are going to be disappointed. Others are going to be thrilled that the moment has finally arrived. I tend to think of it this way  recall the dizzying excitement that you felt as a child when you were going to stay the night at a friend's house. You would stew it over, hype it up, bounce up and down at the thought the entire day before. Sometimes you couldn't sleep. Now imagine that excited anticipation, subconsciously preserved for fifteen years.Because I think it needs to be understood that for a lot of us, ""The Simpsons"" is more than a show. It's a cultural load bearing pillar of our childhood. It's a resource of knowledge and life. So as much as it is impossible to live up to the expectations of a generation still bouncing up and down at the thought, and as much as no film could ever encapsulate the breadth of ""The Simpsons""' brilliance (from 1992 to 1997), there is still a part of me that feels some deep untouchable itch put to blissful rest at the mere sight of Springfield on the big screen.Is it a good movie? I think so. Kinda. It has a plot, and character arcs, and jokes, and all that. But truth be told, it's just about impossible to think of it as a film. When people ask if it's good, they don't mean ""Was it a good film?"" They mean, ""Was it good ""Simpsons""?"" The answer to this question is, again, I think so. Kinda. There are definite upsides to it: writing credits include some of the most prolific writers from the series' golden years: Mike Scully, David Merkin and John Swartzwelder highly amongst them. These people were big believers in taking the show ""back to the family"", and though the character stories cooked up for the film are retreads (Homer endangers the family, then endeavors to save them; Marge's relationship with Homer is put into question; Bart feels he'd be happier with another father), they're at least done by writers who know the characters better than any. There's also some of that good old fashioned *tasteful* celebrity cameo usage which has grown short these past few years: Green Day, Albert Brooks and Tom Hanks lend their voices to mostly great effect.But there are problems as well. Some computer animation here and there puts us just a little bit out of it, we're not used to seeing the camera of Springfield move in that bizarre two dimensional three dimension way that computer assisted cartoons do. This isn't as big a distraction as the fact that ""The Simpsons"" simply works best in an episodic format. It's hard work to enjoy them through one solid plot for feature length. It can be done, but it's a slightly strained kind of enjoyment. Like you're giving the film a hand when it slips a little. Kind of an interactive experience, if you want to be optimistic about it.And the film does slip. I'd say roughly sixty per cent of the jokes got laughs out of my full theatre, and me personally. This is no criticism  at the rate the show's been going, it's practically a miracle. Add that to the aforementioned fact that the film format isn't what ""The Simpsons"" was made for, and you've got yourself what's really a pretty funny production. The film's opening scene, of the Simpson family watching ""The Itchy and Scratchy Movie"" and making amusing parallels, Homer's ""spider-pig"" bit and Bart's naked skateboarding sequence are even downright hilarious (see also 'President Schwarzenegger'). And even though the scenes that cop the ungainly task of moving the plot forward do feel something like awkward punctuations, they need to be there to keep the relatively consistent laughs coming and they don't stop the show completely. We may be able to see the seams, but like an old soft toy, we love it anyway. And really, if you don't; if you're not willing to cut this movie some slack for old time's sake, what are you doing watching it in the first place?",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
"""The Simpsons Movie"" is a dream come true!","In the film based on the hit television series created by Matt Groening, Homer must save the world from a catastrophic event that he himself has created. It all begins with Homer, his new pet pig and a leaky sill full of droppings - a combination that triggers a disaster the likes of which Springfield has never experienced. As Marge is outraged by Homer's monumental blunder, a vengeful mob descends on the Simpsons household. The family makes a narrow escape, but is divided by both conflict and location.As the fates of Springfield and the world hang in the balance, Homer embarks on a personal odyssey of redemption - seeking forgiveness from Marge, the reunion of his splintered family and the salvation of his hometown.After 25 seasons, 500 and something episodes and a lot of awards and honors (including the Peabody Award, 23 Emmy's (r) and a designation from Time magazine as the best-television show of the twentieth century), The Simpsons was finally made as a feature-length motion picture.And it's a good thing because it takes a 2.35:1 anamorphic widescreen format to fully and completely capture the stupidity of Homer Simpson. THE SIMPSONS MOVIE was a long time coming for me because I was expecting to see my favorite TV show on the big screen, so when I first saw this, I thought it would be a disaster, but after watching this on DVD, I actually enjoyed it.The animation is really good and the dialog is just incredible, especially the one-liners and the other jokes that the eleven screen writers who worked on this script for the film, really brought flavor, width and good storytelling to the screen. David Silverman directed this film and his style is really amazing.The acting is just both hilarious and emotionally powerful. This goes to Dan Castellaneta and Julie Kavner as Homer and Marge Simpson, because Homer's famous quotes, ""D'oh!"" and ""Why, you little...!"" is in this film and Marge's dialog written for the film is really amazing.Nancy Cartwright and Yeardley Smith as Bart and Lisa Simpson are just as funny as they are in the cartoon, but Maggie Simpson only says one line of dialog and that is at the end of the film, when they are watching the ending credits and she takes out her pacifier and says, ""Sequel?"".Hank Azaria, Pamela Hayden, Tress MacNeille and Harry Shearer plays various characters including Ned Flanders, Milhouse van Houten, Mr. Montogomery Burns, Smithers, Jimbo Jones and other various characters in the film are really entertaining. The only thing that was kind of missing was Mrs. Krapabel, played by the late Marcia Wallace. She has a cameo though at the beginning of the film.Did I forget to mention the rock band Green Day also has a cameo appearance? They are at the beginning, finishing up the classic theme song composed by Danny Elfman, while the musical score is not composed by Alf Clausen, composer of the TV series, it is composed by Hans Zimmer. The other performance that I did not mention was Albert Brooks as Russ Cargill. He was also very entertaining and quite perfect for the villain.If there is one thing I can criticize this movie about is Maggie Simpson, because the creators just don't know that this character needs to be able to grow. Stewie Griffin from Family Guy also needs to grow, but having him talk and not allowing to walk and talk is just not enough. I would love to see Maggie talk more.Overall, THE SIMPSONS MOVIE is one of those TV show to film adaptations that I think needs to be seen by everyone. It is a perfect, well-made movie with memorable quotes, great performances and very good action pieces. I love this movie and I love the series, but I would love to see another SIMPSONS MOVIE on the big screen sometime soon. This is one cartoon movie, along with Shrek, Toy Story, SpongeBob SquarePants, Frozen and any other animated movie that I don't gets enough credit. My rating is definitely an 8 out of 10, I know I am almost close to a 10 out of 10, but 8 out of 10 work",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

Before Watching: The Simpsons Movie (2007),"""The Simpsons Movie"" (2007) is an animated movie based on the loved cartoons under the same name. The movie is pretty good, but if you want to get as much out of it as possible, there are a few things you need to keep in mind before watching:This movie is obviously very humorous but features different kinds of humor - all from slapstick to sarcasm which fills up the wide range of comedy quite well. A lot of the humor is however irreverent, so if crude jokes bothers you, there will be a few cringey moments.The Simpsons Movie is also serious at times. Despite being a comedy, it delivers some impactful moments that transcends its normal, witty approach. Those moments should be reflected upon and taken seriously, because there are some interesting things to learn. Homer's epiphany, for example, is surprisingly profound.At last, there are some plot elements which does quite make sense. Honestly though, this is a wacky 90-minute cartoon. Take it seriously at times, but not too seriously.My personal grade: a fresh and surprisingly sober 7/10. If you found this helpful, check my profile for more reviews.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Clearly highlights everything that's wrong with The Simpsons,"Don't get me wrong. I was the biggest Simpsons fan back in the day. I still love to watch the older episodes and quote lines among friends, but in the last few years The Simpsons has really gone down hill. Relying more on visual humour (generally involving Homer) than clever dialogue or a well written story.The Simpsons Movie emphasises everything that's wrong with the television show nowadays. Sure, you'll laugh, but it'll probably be a forced laugh. I noticed when I saw the movie, a lot of young children were in the cinema, having a great time. I guess The Simpsons has become just that. A children's show. It's no longer the edgy teen-to-adult animation it once was.",4.0,Anonymous,Animation
Better than I remember,"When I saw this in theatres...I hated it. The Simpsons premiered on Fox a week before I was born. I grew up with this show. I had known for a long time that they were working on a movie and I was so looking forward to it. It was never a bad movie - it just wasn't what I expected it to be and I was upset by that at the time. This is the first time watching it all the way through again since its debut...and I have to say it's grown on me. I can appreciate everything it's trying to do much more now. Don't let sentimentality or unrealistic expectations sully your memory of this movie. Give it another chance. Very little is as great as Seasons 1-9 of Simpsons, but this sure comes close. Here's hoping they have one more like this in them!",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Pretty good,"The Simpsons Movie is pretty good. It's more of an extravagant episode than a transcendent culmination because (despite its crafted comedy) it's missing heart. Specifically, the humor works because jokes are layered into synergistic flurries. Meanwhile, there's abundant setup, making the comedy feel earned. Still, The Simpsons lacks sincere emotions. Main characters arc, but they're also unrelatable because they've become so exaggerated. That's convenient for gags, but undermines the drama. Furthermore, the film touches on social and relational issues, but never emphasizes a true message. Thus, while The Simpsons Movie is enjoyable, it also rings hollow.Technically, The Simpsons Movie optimizes its humor. The editing uses fadeouts, match cuts, and pacing for punchlines. Plus, the cinematography delivers comedic composition, angles, and lighting. Generally, this non-dialogue based comedy is refreshing. Furthermore, the voice acting is iconic, the sound realism is balanced, and the classic theme song is utilized. The CGI effects are less than personal, but they support the amplified humor. Lastly, the production art style is probably the most recognizable part of the franchise. Overall, its dramatic beats and filmmaking are inconsistent, but The Simpsons brings enough diverse comedy to overcome its flaws.Writing: 7/10

Homer Simpson's Adventure to saving his family and make everyone in the world cry with laughter,"The Simpsons has been here for over 22 years and for that it came a movie called The Simpsons Movie, a hilarious spin-off of the Simpsons with Homer Simpson as the main character...again but this time he accidentally dumped the water supply then Russ Cargill, main villain and the boss of EPA puts the dome from the lake oil, then it's up to Homer to save his family and destroy Russ CargillThe movie has the same additional cast and has with Albert Brooks as Russ Cargill, the leader and boss of the EPA, with more jolly-humor, good voice acting and non-stop animation by Matt Groening.

First watching - alright; second watching - pretty good,"I watched The Simpsons Movie back in 2007 at the cinema. It was...average. Nothing special, played like one of the modern episodes of the show.I watched it again a few nights ago and I have to say, I actually enjoyed it this time around. I still don't get Spiderpig and it's appeal - just stupid, as was 'Boob Lady' - completely pointless character.This aside, the movie is satisfying. I honestly think I went into the cinema with pure hatred in my eyes, I expected it to be bad. Now two years later I'm a bit less biased and, well, I haven't watched The Simpsons in so long that it was like revisiting old friends.The narrative is pretty good, despite the brain-dead distractions of Spiderpig and Boob Lady. I really feel that Russ Cargill should have been Scorpio. I know, I know...Scorpio was a one-off parody villain who wouldn't have a reason to harm Homer and Springfield. But still, it would have been nice.Overall, open your eyes and watch at as The Simpsons without thinking about The 'old' Simpsons and The 'new' Simpsons. Just enjoy it for what it is. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

Not grade 'A' Simpsons but still a decent flick,"I've been a Simpsons fan since at least the second season but the announcement of the long-rumoured movie didn't excite me much given that the glory years of the show are long gone. Nevertheless, I still expected something special from the team behind the big screen version.The movie isn't bad but it's nowhere near as good as it could have been. For one thing, I can think of many, many episodes with a much better story than this. After close to twenty years it must be difficult to come up with something new, though, so I guess the so-so story isn't that surprising. However, I am surprised that there was no musical number, particularly since the TV show is known for several memorable ones.I can't really say that the big screen (and big budget) was used to much advantage, either. Sure, there were a few nifty visuals and more detail than usual but the possibilities were endless. The length is even a bit on the short side at 87 minutes. This feels more like a standard episode padded for time and given a spit-shine rather than a story written specifically for the screen.The voice acting is top-notch, as always, but chances are that some of your favourite characters are featured very briefly or not at all. Having the Simpsons leave Springfield (temporarily) didn't exactly help matters there. Also, I have to note that Albert Brooks's immense talents were unfortunately wasted on a thoroughly uninteresting character. The Tom Hanks cameo was a nice touch, though.In conclusion, enjoy this film for what it is but don't expect something that's on par with the best that The Simpsons has to offer. Stick with ""South Park: Bigger, Longer and Uncut"" if you're craving a feature length animated comedy.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Hilarious,"When talking about ""The Simpsons"" you know there will be people running to 2 different sides. Some of them loved the show, now hate it and some of them love the show, period. And there are of course, those who never enjoyed it.I've always enjoyed ""The Simpsons"". Granted I've enjoyed the first few seasons a lot more (even though it seems to be going back to its roots now), but still enjoy the new material. The movie could be considered a mix between old and new Simpsons, and for me, the only place it fails is at not giving the side characters more screen time.Other than that, the movie is hilarious from start to finish, even if some of the jokes are sketchy at best, most of them succeed at at least making you smile, and others at making you laugh of loud. The plot is very crazy and nonsensical, but hey, it's a cartoon, as long as it is entertaining - which it is - it works!The animation is top notch, very fluid, with some 3D elements thrown in (thankfully not too many). The voice actors did an excellent job, as usual. Music is good, but didn't stand out too much, it did it's job (except ""Spider Pig"", which is awesome!). Of course, there's Green Day in it, but I don't enjoy them (not my cup of tea to be honest).It's a great fun, hilarious and very entertaining movie that should be watched by people who enjoy the Simpsons. Especially the ""newer"" seasons, I can see people who don't like the new seasons hating this movie.9 out of 10.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Very funny -- what more could you want?,"I'd always like The Simpsons, but when I saw this movie I hadn't had a chance to catch the TV series in some time. When I do catch it, I rarely know how old a rerun I am seeing, so I was not up on the supposed steep decline in quality that the show has taken in the past few years.There a lot of ways it would be possible to criticise The Simpsons Movie: maybe there isn't enough plot for a full film, what there is is wildly outlandish, subplots are abandoned, it doesn't distinguish itself enough from a long episode of the TV series, or its message seems kind of mixed-up. However, it redeems itself in the best way a comedy film can: by being very funny all the way through. The characters of The Simpsons remain true to their TV selves, there's a constant supply of good jokes (some of which had me laughing obnoxiously loudly), and there's even a kind of character arc. I wouldn't dare ask for more.I do wonder whether Dr Nick stays dead in future TV episodes.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
The Simpletons----- SNORE!,"The run of the T.V. series has lasted longer than my marriage.However watching this movie has left me feeling like the day I walked out of court and my divorce was final. Betrayed and taken for a ride.It was nothing special. Nothing special at all. I equate this movie to the episode where homer burns down the house  only it lasts forever and is not even close to as funny.The writers of this movie just used the same boring formula that they have for the last few years. The TV show has gone flat and downhill for sometime now. So I guess why shouldn't the movie be any different. Did they put any thought into this? Even this plot has been done on the TV show although not exactly the same way. Anyone recall when they moved the town when homer was sanitation commissioner? The show used to be good when it was well written, it's become a mundane TV show What really sucks is the story isn't even as good as the mundane TV show.BORING!",1.0,Anonymous,Animation

Insurmountable Odds Still Require Effort,"Like every other ""Simpsons"" fan on the planet, I waited with dire anticipation for the day when this film would come out, for the day when some of TV's most famous cartoons would dash across the big screen in a thrilling display of genius.Predictably, I was disappointed.Don't get me wrong-- ""The Simpsons Movie"" is a hilarious and lovable motion picture full of the characters' trademark wit and the writers' now-prerequisite social commentary. Unfortunately, with what seems like centuries of development time, such a closely guarded production, a cast of thousands of characters, and such a multitude of scribes, TSM should have been a monumental masterwork. What it feels like is one of the just-OK episodes of the series, playing out in 2.40:1 widescreen and with an orchestral score.The story could easily be compressed into an episode if some unimportant things could be cut. The problem is, the movie is 87 minutes long. Are you kidding me?! After this long, I wanted The Return of the Freakin' King! All that aside, TSM is still very good, but leaves you with a slightly empty feeling after you watch it. One can only hope that the ""sequel"" of which Maggie inquires will be more effective.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

I did not.Without giving too much away, it is like the Family Guy and Futurama films in that it is just like a few episodes stuck together with a continuous story.There were a few laughs but you could get the same amount of laughs and the quality of humour from watching some of the more average Simpsons episodes.

D'oh!,"Who doesn't love the Simpsons? This show has spoofed every American political and social event that has gone on in the amount of time it's been on. So when they made their first feature length film, they just decided to outdo themselves. Homer Simpson (Dan Castellaneta) the well known father of the most outrageous middle class family in the United States, has just polluted an entire lake with pig excrement. Typical. As a result EPA director Russ Cargill (Albert Brooks) encourages President Arnold Schwarzenegger (Harry Shearer) to put a dome on top of Springfield so they can not be connected in any way with the outside world. Homer and the rest of his family are the only people to escape Springfield and make a life as fugitives. And it's up to Homer, Marge, Bart and Lisa to defeat the evil Cargill and save the day. I honestly can not do this movie justice by writing about so I'll just say, go see this. It is one of the funniest movies I have ever seen.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Funny movie making a successful transition,"The Simpsons, a classic family of TV, and now they have finally taken to the big screen, and in good fashion. With the kind of jokes that the Simpsons seemingly had lost, this mixes good old fun with overall stupidity to make a comedy well worth your time. Even the whole town of Springfield come out to salute the show in style, every crazy thing that happens seemingly normal, and is testament to the wacky ideas that the creators put out there.The story is fun, over the top but fun and when Homer is bad, well bad things happen. The town of Springfield has a few new additions to it than what we are used to(and that's not to mention the unique style of animation this movie uses), yes the town seems in disarray at first but the story has a way of throwing us a few curve balls here and there, and keeps us glued to the screen from start to finish.The well known voices are of course in this movie, we even get a cameo that actually is fairly funny as well. Dan Castellaneta as characters such as Homer, Barney and Krusty the Clown is a great voice to use, coupled with Bart's voice done by Nancy Cartwright(plus Ralph, Todd Flanders and Nelson), Julie Kavner as Marge and Yeardley Smith as Lisa, this is one voice cast that is really quite something, oh and they also throw in Hank Azaria, Harry Shearer and Albert Brooks to complete the boiling pot that is The Simpsons Movie.David Silverman is the director and he does a good job, he seems to be able to work with the script well but also add in a few moves of his own. On that point the script, and it has a seemingly endless list of names to it so I'm just going to say it is all good and fine and really along with the direction forms a nice basis for the humour of this movie. Some will go along and say this is one silly movie and to be fair, it kind of is, but it's silly where you laugh and if anything it's like making a silly thing, but putting brains behind it.I know people who don't like the Simpsons and maybe even fans too felt this was a bad idea, stick to TV right. Well I think this was a great choice to do, in fact I would even go so far as to say this had brought new life and maybe even new fans to the Simpsons. It all comes down to the originality of the plot(disregarding Stephen King) and the freshness of the jokes, it just feels like this new wave has come over the creators and suddenly the writers are on fire again once more.I think the movie also points out some good points, of course most of the rational points are shut down by Homer but in any case they show faults in society today. The environment is so close to Lisa's heart and yet the town seem hell bent on destroying it, and then there's the president who's quick picking of his options show's a humorous look at the government and their policies in the world. Of course don't look into it that much, this is just a comedy after all but the satirical take's are pretty nicely done and not that obvious either.All in all this makes me feel glad, I am a Simpsons fan and I watched this as if I wasn't, but even that couldn't stop me liking this as a film. I think it's the kind of movie you can watch again, yes OK maybe it won't necessarily be one of your all time favourites but in any case you may want to revisit this little yarn in the future, and have a few chuckles also.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Over-hyped,"Love the Simpsons on TV - but there was always a danger that stretching the format to feature length would just add padding to the same number of jokes, and - sadly - that's what's happened here. The Simpsons is by no means a bad movie but it's just not so much funnier or smarter than any one of the TV episodes that I think it's worth paying cinema prices. Sure, there are some great gags and very funny lines but at the end of the day, it's a very long cartoon without even the surprise of original characters to recommend it (as happened with movies like Monsters Inc and Shrek). If you (like me) prefer the TV episodes that deal mostly with the immediate family and the way they cope with rather mundane problems, then you'll probably be underwhelmed by this movie. By necessity its plot is widened to encompass world issues and other locations. I notice the rating has already dropped from a ridiculous 9, and fully expect to see it slide to a more sensible level once people come to their senses. No criticism is implied of the makers - I think they did as well as they could with the feature format. I just think most half-hour shows work well precisely because they're half-hour gems, tightly packed with ideas, laughs and funny asides. Watching exactly the same formula for three times as long didn't work for me.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
thefilmguru reviews: The Simpson's Movie,"The Simpson's Movie has had movie critics dribbling at the prospect of it being the new movie to bash. It's perfect bait. With this much of a fan base and this much hype surrounding its release, even the public were waiting to hate it. But alas. Not even the critics are pretending to hate this film.In a summer of hyped movies that have been major disappointments, (Pirates 3, Spiderman 3) The Simpson's Movie is a welcome injection of solid fulfilment and humour into this years solid blockbusting rubbish.The creators have strived to adapt a fast paced television show into something audiences need to stay with for an hour and a half. With all the writers being used to making a passable, easy storyline for the TV show, it seems they thought the only way they can keep people interested is to see the relatable town in extraordinary situations. It sort-of works, but a lot of people may be disappointed by the change in pace and style from the TV show.Scenes are able to stretch their legs in a longer running time, this aiming to make it not feel just like a long episode, but as you are still watching a 2D cartoon, it seems odd that it's subjected to such a mature structure. This does test the concentration as your brain instinctively expects a flicky, snappy, choppy, quick-scened riot.But, the creators have been very wise, because while they have upped the running time and therefore the scene length, they have also upped the gag count. All the above criticism is all forgotten in the array of chuckle-worthy jokes flying at you every 30 seconds. Unlike the structure and pacing, they manage to keep the style of jokes loyal to the TV show. Homer repeatedly hurting himself and Homer strangling Bart are just some of the old favourites that have made it to the big screen. And these well known ones are mingled in with some genuinely strong and funny new material. This silencing some that say that The Simpson's has run out of steam. But, people who are new to The Simpson's (who aren't many), will not get the inside jokes which clog up quite a lot of the scenes. This is because the film sets off expecting everyone to know the characters already, therefore the people who don't, may not get some gags which are related to certain character traits.But it never overstays its welcome. After all I've said about The Simpson's relishing the chance at breathable scenes, they still never forget that at its core, it's a TV show, and usually we only intend to stay with these characters for half an hour. Therefore they clearly and nicely round it off at one and a half hours.All in all I believe that The Simpson's hasn't disappointed, but while its humour isn't an acquired taste, I still believe this is mostly only going to entertain the lovers of the TV show, due to the many nudge-nudge-wink-wink styled inside jokes. However, in a cinematic age of action movies and things blowing up, The Simpson's Movie is welcome as the only real intelligent thing aroundwith a few things blowing up to top it off.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Disappointing,"I came into the cinema with a lot of expectations. After 90 unfunny minutes I came out saying that this was just as unfunny as all the recent episodes, although many people in the cinema laughed to whole time. There was only unfunny slapstick and predictable jokes. A few scenes made me laugh a bit, but the really good jokes were missing. Where are the good jokes from the old seasons? The trailer says, the film has been made in 20 years, but the jokes were probably invented in recent times. Anyway, anyone who loved the old seasons(say 1-9 maybe 10) will be disappointed; anyone who finds the recent seasons also funny will have a great time with this movie.

It might be the low expectation or more because of the good stuff in the movie itself that I liked it. Continuing with the animated movies' world's theme of environmental message, this one also has one and they are well mixed with the jokes from every character in the movie. That was the best thing about this movie that every character had added to the humor, it wasn't like you wait for a particular character to show up to make you laughin a word it was very funny.and I am gona start watching the show also",,Anonymous,Animation
Very Good But Not Simpsons Great,"I am a long time fan of the show. I thought they should do a movie and looked forward to the movie, but if you really appreciate the amount of action, the willy-nilly progress of plot development, and the pow-pow-pow of the comments and references of the half hour show, it is natural to be a bit cautious about the onset of a 90 minute (or so) version therof.Did my duty, skipped work in order to view the Simpsons movie on its first outing.It lived up to the Simpsons characters and to the depiction of history as: ""just a lot of stuff that happens."" If you are an Alaskan, you are in for a special treat. 'Nuff said.Although it has some must-see moments, all in all it's not a lot more than the average television episode crams into the half-hour slot of its existence. (And less than is sardined into the three stories per half hour of the Halloween specials).There were Simpsonic characteristics that were simply missing in action: Weird plot twists - The movie gives no sense of the incredible ADD leaps that can take place in the first five minutes of a standard Simpsons episode.Attention to characters and objects. In the movie, several characters show up and then kind of disappear, or seem underutilized.Conclusion: Definitely worth seeing, but suffers from lack of compression. Some aspects borrowed from Futurama. If you are not a Simpson show watcher, this is a good intro. The TV show packs more punch in shorter jabs.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Not a stunning movie based on the groundbreaking TV series, but still has some good laughs","It has now been two decades since the Simpsons were first seen on TV, featured in animated shorts on ""The Tracey Ullman Show"", and nearly eighteen years since the full episodes started coming, but it has only been a few days since the world-renowned cartoon family finally made it to the big screen! Personally, I think the groundbreaking series used to be incredible, but no matter how good a show is, it can't likely maintain its quality for eighteen seasons, so I also believe that since the show's heyday, it has gradually gone downhill, and I don't watch new episodes anymore. However, I still planned to go and see this movie when it came into theatres, and certainly wasn't as disappointed as I could have been!While Green Day performs on a vessel in Lake Springfield, they begin to talk about the environment, but receive a negative response from the audience of Springfield citizens. Garbage thrown at the band damages the vessel, causing it to sink and kill the band members! After this incident, as Lisa tries to warn other Springfield residents about pollution, nobody listens, until she meets an Irish boy named Colin. Together, these two manage to convince the town that the lake should be cleaned up. However, after Homer adopts a pig, he must somehow dispose of its waste, and decides to depose of it in the lake, causing heavy pollution! After President Arnold Schwarzenegger is informed about this by Russ Cargill, the head of the EPA, a giant dome is placed over Springfield, trapping the city's residents inside! Homer finds himself in a lot of trouble when the town learns that he is responsible for the lake's pollution!I laughed pretty hard during the intro of the movie, with Itchy & Scratchy, which made me think that the movie might turn out to be excellent, but it didn't. Not all the gags in the movie are as funny as the one at the beginning (though some are), and some parts are not so amusing. I was also bothered by the animation. With the backgrounds (more enhanced than the ones we expect to see in the series), it's not quite the same. Fortunatly, the Simpsons do go on a reasonable adventure in the movie, there are some very funny moments after the Itchy & Scratchy intro, including the part where Homer dares Bart to skateboard naked to Krusty Burger and back, and Bart decides to do it, as well as several moments made funny by Homer's stupidity. All this is far from enough to make this long-awaited movie perfect, but it is enough to make it pretty good.It appears the idea of a ""Simpsons"" movie first came up long ago, and the plot for the 1992 episode, ""Kamp Krusty"" was originally intended to be for a movie, but the show's writing staff just couldn't make it long enough, so instead, the plot was used for the first episode of Season 4. It has been fifteen years since that episode first aired, and ""The Simpsons Movie"" has finally come! Unfortunately, it probably would have been better if it was made during the TV show's days of glory in the 1990s. In fact, it could have turned out to be as good as all the classic episodes! However, although it sadly wasn't made until those days were long over, it could have turned out worse. The movie may show the declining quality of ""The Simpsons"" to SOME degree, but not completely. Unless you're a big fan of the recent seasons of the show, I wouldn't consider ""The Simpsons Movie"" a must-see, but if you don't like the way the show has been going lately, you still might find SOME entertainment value in it.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

"Solid film, but enough's enough.","The Simpsons Movie - The once well-loved yellow family gets a big screen debut in which they are exiled from Springfield after Homer dooms the city. The family heads to quite possibly the only place left in the world that they HAVEN'T gone to: Alaska. Homer is forced to learn a life lesson. Marge nags as per usual and sounds closer to Patty or Selma than her original voice. Bart skateboards nude in a hilarious sequence, but becomes an obnoxious thorn in the movie's paw as he becomes a total jerk towards Homer (He never realized Homer was a bad father in how many seasons?). Lisa, almost no one's favorite character, actually gets some great moments and she finds a cute Irish boyfriend.Tom Hanks has two funny bits on the film, and Al Brooks is underused.Now, any true Simpsons fan probably stopped watching about 7 years ago, as the show's last best memorable episode was probably ""Behind the Laughter"". The film gets a better sharper aesthetic that is a little more reminiscent of the show's golden years. Think of it as Revenge of the Sith to the original Star Wars trilogy. Hardly stellar, but a breath of fresh air compared to the recent garbage.The film strikes at brilliance once or twice, keeps the laughs coming generally, and I'm sure everyone will be singing ""Spider Pig"" to the point of tedium by the end of the summer. The film kind of runs out of steam halfway through, but picks it up by the end.Sidenote: Subtly making the EPA the villain of the movie just put a bad taste in my mouth, a reminder that FOX controls the strings of The Simpsons.This was a solid movie but I can't in good conscience support what means God knows how many more unnecessary Simpsons seasons.

A big disappointment for a big fan of the series,"I have been a big fan of the show since the early 90's and have watched the series morph and develop into something very different over the years. Although the last ten seasons or so have not compared to the first eight or so, there have still been some gems that continue to draw me to watch.I was a big fan of the the South Park movie and even the Power Puff Girls movie, both of which took each series to a new level.I approached The Simpsons Movie with cautious optimism and refused to let all the hype set me up for disappointment. Despite the fact that my expectations were set on medium, it pains me to say that I was still disappointed. The movie has very little of the cleverness of the series and although there were some laugh-out-loud moments, it was at best a long, mediocre episode.I imagine that casual Simpsons fans will find the movie to be a better than average comedy, but die-hard Simpsons fans will be left feeling short-changed.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Tremendously Funny!,"This, for me, was one of the highlight movies of 2007. If your reason for not seeing it is 'The Simpsons sucks these days', then I urge you to give it a shot. It is much much better than the most recent episodes of the show, while admittedly not as good as the 'classic' episodes from about seasons 2-10.The characters are all there, in full yellow, as funny and witty as ever they were. The jokes are certainly the best I've seen in a while, and had me laughing long after they had been said. In the true tradition of the show, there are special guest appearances, from Tom Hanks and the members of Green Day.But what I feel makes this especially good, is that it feels like a movie, not an elongated episode. The story is allowed to have more depth than if it were told in just one episode. The animation is as good as it has always been, and from a technical perspective, the movie is very sound.There will be a few surprises along the way, especially during Bart's skateboarding scene (people who have seen it will know what I'm talking about), and, as with every episode, there are a few new characters, notably Russ Cargill and President Schwarzenegger.Truly, this is worth seeing for any Simpsons fan 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Inferior to the TV show, but not bad on its own merits","While it is no masterpiece, The Simpsons Movie is one of those few TV-show-turned movies that didn't want to make me gag and kick the TV screen (think Tom and Jerry: The Movie.) I feel that The Simpsons has gone down in quality in the last few years, so this movie pleasantly surprised me. It won't win any awards, but as a long time Simpsons fan, I was not disappointed.The plot is a simple one which involves Homer indirectly causing Springfield to be enclosed in a giant dome. It is up to America's favourite yellow family to save the day. The plot plays out like a regular episode, but it is slightly more surreal. Obviously, there is quite a bit of filler, but it is entertaining filler so I can forgive the film for that.My only real major quibble with this film is that it is simply too odd at times. I remember The Simpsons as being a down-to-earth show, and there are sequences here that look like they have jumped right out of Balto II: Wolf Quest. They are funny sequences, but unnecessary.What I like most about The Simpsons Movie is that it knows that it is nothing groundbreaking or spectacular, and it doesn't try to be anything different. If you are a fan, this is definitely worth checking out, because it has more than enough replay value.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Lots of TV Episodes a LOT Funnier,"My wife and I have been Simpson fans since they were first introduced on the Ullman show. We've been looking forward to the movie for months now, saw it this afternoon and BOTH of us were pretty disappointed. I don't think we laughed out loud more than four or five times throughout the entire feature and neither did anyone else in the theatre. The absence of some of the supporting characters who make the series hilarious was really apparent, and the ones who DID appear didn't add much to the ""fun quotient"" of the film. Reasonably boring fare, watchable, but it should have been a LOT funnier than it was. TOO BAD!!!!",3.0,Anonymous,Animation
The greatest simpson family adventure of all time,"This is my favorite animated movie of all time.This is a worthy adaptation for such a beloved series
The movie has good original characters that didn't appear in the show such as Russ cargill and President Schwarzenegger, also it respected the humor of the series and i had a lot of fun watching this movie and I hope that Disney will do an sequel. Othe thing is that this film is better than other movies based on cartoons like Dora and the lost city of gold and the SpongeBob SquarePants movie
Well the point is that this film is enjoyable for the Simpson fans and the people ho doesn't watch the show
Finally I am really waiting for an sequel.",,Anonymous,Animation
"Reasonably entertaining, nothing more. The youngsters will love it.","8.0?! I think this movie will settle at 7.6 in time. Entertaining, not bad, but little wow factor.It is difficult to write 10 lines about this movie, there just isn't that much to write about. Perhaps that is why IMDb is uncharacteristically misleading on this one.Generally entertaining, but this was really just a longer episode with most of the same old stories being re-played yet again. Looks like it is aimed at 12 year olds who I suspect will love it and then look back 10 years from now and wonder what they were thinking.Definitely fun to see on DVD, but living in London where it costs $20 a person, if you are lucky, it just isn't worth it.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation

Great fun,I agree with many other reviewers that The Simpsons Movie did fail to match the high standards of the early years of the series. However this film is still very funny and has a decent story and a lot of heart as well.Many of the jokes are as good as anything we saw in the early years of the show and come at such a fast rate you have to watch the film again to catch them all.Although there isn't much time given to the supporting characters the main focus was always going to be the family. I would like to see a sequel based around Sideshow Bob though.Overall a great film that despite not meeting some fans high standards is much much funnier than some of the tripe that gets passed off as comedy.,8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Great entertainment for everyone,After watching serials about Simpsons it was big surprise to hear about the movie . I wasn't so interested in this movie at first because of Croatian terrible synchronization . Then I got it on DVD . It was nice to see this movie because it followed serials and there were a lot of fun as we could expect . Every character was showed as he really was . It is so realistic and I think that it also has its point . I enjoyed in every scene because this is big surprise . It is great movie and I think that everybody should see it . Everything in this movie was perfect so I suggest you to watch it . Maybe it isn't a big fun as serial but it is great how movie is showed . I am definitely recommending this movie to everybody who haven't already watched it . This is great showing of serial on big screen .,9.0,Anonymous,Animation

A fun watch but not a classic,"The Simpsons Movie is consistently mildly amusing but the big, BIG laugh never arrives. There's nothing that's particularly brilliant or surprising, especially when you remember what episodes in the first 10 years of the series threw up. This could be because we're over-familiar with the show and were expecting too much from the movie. It was never going to be a movie of an 18-year-old TV show that was going to provide the year's most remarkable, invigorating, innovative cinematic experience. Still, it's a good natured, good hearted film which seeks to entertain. My favourite moment, by far, was Bart's nude skateboarding, it's splendidly done.That this is in the IMDb top 100 already (and My Name Is Bruce has entered the top 200) clearly demonstrates how unreliable the ratings system is. I can't say I really understand how it works. IMDb claim it's the thousand most regular voters who make the chart. Presumably the special thousand are constantly changing. But how does that explain the high new entries of movies popular with certain fan types, followed by their gradual sliding? So the fan boys are also the most prolific voters? All very strange, and surely a sign of a system in need of a change. How about barring films from entering the top 250 until they're at least one month old?",6.0,Anonymous,Animation

"A mixture of ""D'oh"" and ""Whoo-hoo""","Has any movie this summer been met with more fan pressure than The Simpsons Movie? When you consider that viewers have been clamoring for a theatrical film for over 10 years, you certainly have to admire creator Matt Groening's guts for not rushing a movie out into theaters just to make money. I walked into the film with mixed emotions. On one hand, this was a moment I had been waiting for since I was literally 13-years-old. On the other, given the dip in quality on the show during the past few years, I was desperately trying not to set my hopes up too high. Now that I have seen it, I can safely say that the movie combines both the best and worst aspects of the show itself into an uneven, but still highly entertaining, film.The Simpson family's beloved town of Springfield is slowly being turned into a hazardous waste dump after years of dumping garbage and sludge into the local lake. After rock group Green Day have an untimely demise sinking into the murky depths of the lake, 8-year-old Simpson daughter Lisa (voice by Yeardley Smith) makes it her mission to wake up the local townspeople to what's happening. Unfortunately, her father Homer (Dan Castellaneta) has never been one to listen to sense or reason. Due to reasons too complicated to summarize here, Homer winds up dumping a silo full of pig feces into the lake, officially turning the town into the most polluted place on Earth. The Government decides to get involved, and President Arnold Schwarzenegger (Harry Shearer) is talked into sealing the entire town within a dome in order to protect the rest of the world by the head of the Environmental Protection Agency (Albert Brooks). Along with loving wife Marge (Julie Kavner), hell-raising son Bart (Nancy Cartwright), and baby Maggie, Homer must find a way to escape from the town after the people of Springfield turn against him for dooming them all.Like many TV-to-film adaptations, The Simpsons Movie struggles to adapt itself to its new format. After a fairly strong opening 40 minutes, the movie slows down quite a bit, and becomes mired in an environmental-themed plot that avoids being too preachy, but still seems somewhat out of place for the characters. I understand that this is a movie, and Groening and his team are trying to not just make a retread of the show. And yet, the movie still seems padded. There are numerous subplots to fill in time, but these either have disappointing or no resolution at all, or they are good as they currently are, but could have been even better if the film focused on them a little bit more. A good example is the plot concerning son Bart feeling he doesn't get enough attention from his father, and starts seeking solace in overly kind neighbor Ned Flanders. What's up there on the screen is good, but watching it, I felt like it never builds the way it should, and the pay off is pretty much non-existent and overly rushed. Only the plot concerning young Lisa finding her soul mate with a new boy named Colin seems to hit the right mark when it comes to a close.For every bit of weakness contained within The Simpsons Movie, there are at least two moments to make up for it at least. I laughed quite a bit throughout the film, and smiled even more, especially during the first half of the film. The film is at its best before the proper ""save the town"" plot kicks in, and tries to be just as irrelevant as the show can often be. There is a sense of free-spirited anarchy and fun that is curiously missing from the later half of the film. While the plot-driven part of the film does have its moments of brilliance, it never quite lives up to everything that came before it. I'm proud to say that the commercials have for once not ruined the best jokes in the film. Given the decline in the writing on the TV show the past couple seasons, it seriously felt good to laugh out loud at the characters again.I strongly believe that your reaction to The Simpsons Movie will depend greatly on your reaction to The Simpsons themselves. If you never got into the show, this movie will do absolutely nothing to change your mind. The movie knows its audience, and unless you're a member of the converted, you can give this a pass. But, for those who have literally been waiting years for this movie, it may not be perfect, but you won't be let down overall. Be sure to stick around for the end credits as well, to hear Maggie learn an important ""first word"" when it comes to Hollywood. The quality of The Simpsons Movie doesn't quite make me long for what she hopes for, but at the same time, I wouldn't mind it.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation

"10 years too late, and the wait, not really worth it.","An absolutely average movie. There isn't really a lot about this to say except it had few chuckles and many gags that just don't belong in a movie. Half of the gimmicks/jokes aren't barley even worth a regular episode on the show, let alone having to pay 10 bucks to see what was done better the first few years of the show. Overall I give it a little better than a 2 stars, but not worth more than that. For the die-hard fans (meaning those that still watch the show now) I'm sure they will love it. For those that stopped watching it 10 years ago, we'll just think it was a decent longer episode of the glory years of the show. For those that don't watch ""The Simpsons"" at all, well they will chuckle a little bit, but they won't think much about it. All the good reviews are sort of hard to stomach, because the film really isn't that good on it's on merits. I won't say the film is bad, but c'mon now people it's not really that good either! Right now it's ranked here on IMDb as one of the TOP 250 ever. I am hoping that as people calm down after waiting 19 years to see this (A big reason why it's rating is so high) film, they will go back and see the film isn't really all that terrific. I will say that the marketing of this film is some of the best I have ever seen though.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Really good.,"The Simpsons finally managed to deliver a feature film that had two functions: present our beloved characters in a story that could be original and make us laugh. They did it. Every funny story requires a certain ridiculousness where some characters carry the responsibility of generating hilarity on their backs. The best joke in this case comes from the dog. Beyond that, it is a round film where everything we expect is present. It is surprising that the producers have not insisted on preparing more feature films since there is material to do so with so many well-designed characters. It's very good.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

Horrible.,"I was excited by the good reviews of this movie. I had spent the last few months trying to suppress any excitement about the movie..because based on the past few seasons of the TV show, I was afraid it was going to be a horrible disappointment, but then when people started reporting that it was good.. a herald back to the times of good TV episodes, I let myself get psyched.I was set up for a HUGE letdown. It was exactly like the crappy new episodes. I got a mild forced chuckle out of a few lines or scenes.. but it wasn't well-written, it wasn't clever, homer was a soulless oaf, it wasn't funny. It hurt. It was a kick in the face to everyone who loved the series back in it's prime. The show that used to be more or less about a typical family that happens to be yellow and animated is gone forever I suppose, and has been replaced by a show (and now a movie) about a completely unbelievable family of outrageous unlovable unlikeable monsters.",1.0,Anonymous,Animation
It's a hell of a town!,"The Simpsons have broken records, broken boundaries, and have kept us laughing for close to two decades. It paved the way for animated programming geared towards an older audience. Without The Simpsons, there would be no South Park, no Family Guy, and the word ""D'oh!"" would not have been entered into the Oxford English Dicionary.In that span of time they have had a slew of awards, video games, board games, fan clubs, clothing, but never a movie. It took Matt Groening and his team of creators 18 years and nearly four hundred episodes before The Simpsons Movie lit up the theatre marquee.Homer, Marge, Bart, Lisa, Maggie, and all of the citizens of Springfield, USA have taken the big screen by storm and in a big way. We find America's favorite dysfunctional family in the midst of an environmental crisis. The town lake is being polluted to the brink of ecological collapse. Only if the town bands together will the problem be solved.Of course, it doesn't work out. Homer inevitably puts the entire town at risk of total destruction and the EPA along with President Schwartzenegger must come in and solve the problem so as to not disturb the rest of the country.The usual ""Simpsonian"" plot ensues where Homer thinks he does the right thing but actually doesn't. Bart loses faith in Homer and looks for guidance elsewhere. Lisa has fallen in love with someone who fights for what she believes in. Maggie sucks her pacifier. Marge must bring everyone back to reality so the family can save the day.So what is the big deal? Other than the fact that it is the first Simpsons movie, the story is decent enough and entertaining enough to sit down and enjoy. It doesn't go on too long and the writing is really funny. It seems that the writing staff really took there time on this project, seeing as they didn't have to do it for next Sunday's FOX lineup. The jokes are timed perfectly and the material is fresh.One thing that I was afraid of was that the film would be overrun with cameo appearances seeing as it would be cool to do a voice in The Simpsons Movie. Fortunately, there are only a few, and those few are well placed and well executed.Whether or not there will be another Simpsons movie or not, who knows. There are some elements of the film that make it seem like this would more than likely be the end of the series, but what will life be like without the Simpsons? They can't just live in syndication and DVD sets, can they? That day will ultimately come, but it doesn't have to be right now.The Simpsons Movie puts the charge back into the series.

Thank God It Didn't Suck,"I, like many, have loved The Simpsons for as long as I can remember. One of my first toys was a Bart stuffed doll. I have always had a special connection with the television series and when I found out they were making a movie, I had mixed feelings. On one hand, this could be hilarious and could turn out to be a great movie to go to just to have a good laugh. On the other hand, however, this could easily be a mistake of a movie that could destroy the series as a whole. Luckily, with the odds against them, they managed to turn this into a great movie that lived up to my expectations and made me laugh for a couple hours.This movie had a lot going against it. Turning a TV series into a movie usually ends with disaster, even if the TV series is one as popular as The Simpsons. People expected it to be bad. Unfortunately, as much as I love the series, I expected this to be a pretty bad movie. The only shred of hope I had was the preview that included ""Spider-Pig."" However, when it all came down to opening night, I figured that The Simpsons had entertained me for free for a countless number of years, that the least I could do was to contribute to its box office success.As I sat in the theater, I found myself constantly laughing and finding the movie to be very enjoyable. When it comes down to it, this is what makes a movie good. If a movie keeps you enjoyed for the time you spend in the theater and you spend the whole time laughing and really into the story, it deserves a good review. So what if The Simpsons has changed from the first few seasons. They are still funny, original, and America's #1 family. Thats why ""The Simpson's Movie"" gets a 9 out of 10.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

Everybody in this theatre is a giant sucker! Especially YOU!,"In this debut feature film for the iconic animated characters, the citizens of Springfield have been thoughtlessly dumping all sorts of garbage into their town lake, creating an untenable situation. Homer tips the scales when, in a hurry, he deposits a silo full of the excrement from his pet pig into the lake. The environment of the town now thoroughly damaged, this motivates the E.P.A. to encase Springfield in a giant dome. (The brainchild of an evil businessman named Russ Cargill, voiced by a wonderful Albert Brooks.) The Simpsons become fugitives from justice, and it takes a long time for Homer to realize that he will have to step up to the plate and save the town from this disaster that he created.It may just be that the show-runners waited too long to make a feature film version of their series; the material is not quite as sharp as it was when the series was at its satiric best. Stretching out a fairly standard, predictable story like this to feature length does result in some stretches that aren't as interesting. Surprisingly, the material is a little more adult than some people might expect, which might cause it to lose some viewers. That said, this viewer had a pretty good time with ""The Simpsons Movie"". It was uproarious at times, especially in its opening quarter. But once it goes beyond the length of a typical episode, the inspiration kind of runs out. Gags become spottier as it goes on. But the screenwriters (*11* people are credited!) remain true enough to the characters, with the cast obviously in very fine form. Dan Castellaneta as always is a riot as Homer; series mainstay Harry Shearer gets to have some real fun voicing ""President Schwarzenegger"". ""I was born to lead, not read.""Overall, it may be that casual viewers will enjoy this more than any fans that the series will have had.Like a number of deliberately zany comedies, animated and otherwise, it does pay to stay with this one through the (admittedly lengthy) closing credits.Seven out of 10.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

"Well,  it was definitely funny... but not classic Simpsons funny","Don't get me wrong, this film is definitely not bad, but it seemed to be missing something.Let me just say that The Simpsons is my favorite television show---at least from season 1-9. And this was not exactly a best time for a movie to come out... When the show was already downhill.The movie has some very funny moments and definitely keeps you entertained. Also, all of the characters were actually in character, which is of course important. Not to mention the animation is VERY nice to look at!The problems I have with it? First off, ""a cast of thousands"" is complete BS. None of the side characters of Springfield really get any screen time (aside from the Flanders.) It would have been great to see Sideshow Bob--who is one of my favorite characters--and I wished to see wayyyyyy more with Mr. Burns. He is one of the funniest characters on the show who everyone loves to hate, but he only got ONE scene! The show had many great characters and barely focuses on them. Yes I know the Simpsons are obviously the main characters, but they could have done sooo much with these characters.Another problem I have is the Marge and Homer separating subplot.. I am so sick of this. We all know how it is going to end...that is all.Now here is the MAIN problem I have: Its humour is the type of humour you would see in the NEW Simpsons episodes, but not really of the original and memorable seasons and episodes. It's really hard to explain it, but The Simpsons humour used to be very clever and memorable. People to this day still quote old Simpsons episodes (often by heart) but I don't see anyone quoting much from this movie since it came out. That's because the humour isn't all that timeless and memorable.Overall, if you are a fan of the new Simpsons or are just looking for a good comedy, then you will love it and get good laughs. If you are a long time Simpsons fan, you MIGHT enjoy it, and get a few laughs here or there. I still watch this movie occasionally and enjoy it, but definitely not one of my favourites.6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Animation

Better late than never,"(75%) I've loved almost every minute (and repeated minute) of the Simpsons for years now, and probably always will.

"Not a ""D'Oh!"" ... Not an ""Excellent"" either ...","More than the film, I remember the event it was. For the first time, the fans were about to see their favorite show in a movie theater. Could you imagine that? Bart, Homer, Marge, Mr. Burns, Moe, Barney, all the Springfield town painting the big screen in a dazzling and bright yellow  that was one movie adaptation no one could ever refuse. A sure hit for the fans, but not necessarily a sure critical success. I think we should all admit that we all watched the film because it was a novelty on itself, and no Simpson fan, no parent of a Simpson fan could miss it, but the certainty of a critical success was more than debatable. The excitement was sincere but so was the apprehension.Now, after five years, I can't really put my finger exactly in what went wrong in ""The Simpsons Movie"". In fact, I almost want to say that nothing was wrong; it had the fun, the wit, the satire, the zaniness but also the tenderness, the warmth and the heart of some of the greatest Simpsons' episodes. But when you dilute it in almost one hour and twenty minutes, it loses its spectacular value and you can't help but notice some slower moments plot-wise. Whatever it is, it's exactly why I can't call the film 'great', but just a 'very good' with some great moments. And I didn't even have high expectations take it from a Simpsons' fan.I didn't expect a lot because like so many hardcore fans (I watch the show almost every day and know hundreds of episodes by heart), I got used to disappointments. As I posted once on IMDb, there was a time when ""The Simpsons"" were influencing Pop-Culture but now, it's Pop Culture influencing ""The Simpsons"", the result is not bad, but the episodes are generally hit-or-miss, rarely average, either great or lame. I could picture the Simpsons movie disappointing me, and I kept this feeling as a psychological shield so I could never be truly disappointed enough to abandon my faith over the show's chances of improvement. Talk about negative preconceived ideas but let's say it was just some sort of self-preservation instinct.But the first minutes were surprisingly hilarious and they really made me lower my guard, the sight of little Ralph Wiggum trumpeting along with the Fox fanfare was very funny and encouraging (too bad, one of the film's highlights started so soon). And it went on with the ""Itchy and Scratchy"" bit and Homer's self referential accusation. The opening sequence couldn't get more creative with Frink passing along the whispering clouds and saying 'the movie' or Bart writing on the chalkboard that he'll never download this film illegally, I could sit and eat comfortably my popcorn expecting the opening sequence to go until the couch but then suddenly, the film switched with the sight of a unknown pop group singing in a concert. The 'Da-da-da' lip-synching was funny but I thought the cut was too abrupt.I would have preferred the film to take its time to set-up the film as it does for TV episodes. Maybe it was eager to get to the point, since we all knew everybody and the 'Titanic' reference was very clever. Overall, the film wouldn't start to worry me  not until Grandpa's outburst in the church (which was my first alert) and the whole Spider-pig thing (the fact that we don't see the pig after that, damages the solidity of this plot element) and when I understood that the film would only focus on the family. I thought it was a mistake because the material would have served better for a TV episodes' plot. The film didn't exploit all the possibilities that were offered to it. It didn't even had songs, perfect leverages for most posterity. Remember ""South Park"", what most people remember from it? The songs.And the ""South Park"" movie had at least the merit to feature all the population of the town and make a very clever satire, while ""The Simpsons"" focused on the family and didn't use the characters the way we'd expect. After all, couldn't Mr. Burns be the main antagonist, the one who'd make this dome on Springfield, he did far worse when he decided to block the sunshine. I also wished there was more Barney, Karl and Lenny, Krusty the Clown, and all the great supporting characters that'd populated the show since 1990, but the movie felt like a concentration of three kind of plots : Homer gets a new job, Homer screws up, Problem in the family, not the best of these recent years.""The Simpsons"" have always been synonyms of smartness, unpredictability, a clever way to be ahead of what we'd expect, it's precisely because I have a tenderness for the show that I felt bad to predict all what was going to happen, the whole redemption of Homer, him reconciling with Bart and all that stuff. I didn't see everything coming, but then again, I never said the movie was disastrous, nor that I was disappointed, simply that it had the potential to be greater than what it actually is. Although I believe it should have been nominated for the Best Animation film Oscar category, if only because it's hand-drawn for once, I don't think the creators wanted to make 'a masterpiece'. Nonetheless, the film is qualitatively good, in the same level than the Simpsons as a TV show in 2007.But I only wish I could have been more enthusiastic to review this film as I would to one of my favorite episodes.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

"Jokes are Fine, but It Should Have Been More","Doesn't it suck how so many big event hyped-up movies are labelled with 'it could have been more' these days? But I guess that means when they get it right, its even more special.The one-liners and pranks are fine all the way through. There's nothing cringe-worthy-in-a-bad-way here. You'll chuckle, but something needed to be done to separate this from, and make it much more than, just an extended TV show. This is possibly as hard as it sounds, but I'll tell you what they needed to do. They needed to make the premise much more significant. They main plot needed to be incredibly daring/wacky/outrageous and possibly irreparable. What they chose - government's big dome going over Springfield - was not that interesting and wasn't even milked to enough comic effect. Unlike other major crises on the TV show, this one has the opportunity to stretch out for two hours and reveal deeper and more complex internal conflicts inside the souls of Springfield - to comic effect of course. The other plot threads - Marge and Homer's marriage problems, Bart's Dad problem, Lisa's boyfriend - aren't that bad but you pretty much know how they're going to end up.So what we have left is lots of good one-liners and pranks, and a feeling that it was all over so quickly. The makers really wanted this to be good. They seemed to have wanted it so badly that they were afraid to stick their big toe in too much. It's like a good TV episode, and a kind of missed opportunity.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Average,"The Simpsons had been going downhill since the 9th Series, and the show lost a lot of credibility of making episodes like The Principal and the Pauper and All Singing, All Dancing, but generally still a good series. The new episodes are barely watchable now and to me the Simpsons is like an old sick pet, you would rather see it put to sleep then watch it suffer anymore pain. I did not have high hopes for the Simpsons Movies because of the decline of the show, and few of my friends did not recommend seeing it. I did not see it at the cinema and have recently seen it on Sky Movies.The plot of the film is that Springfield is on the edge of ecologically disaster and Lisa campaigns to protect Springfield River. At church Grampa Simpson has a vision and warns that Springfield is heading for danger. Mayor Quimby orders that the river needs to be cleaned up. At the same time Homer adopts a pet pig, Spiderpig/Harry Popper (you can guess what they were making fun of). Homer ends up filling a silo full of pig and his own waste. When taking the silo to be disposed of Lenny calls Homer to tell him that Lard-boy doughnuts were going out of business and giving after free doughnuts. Knowing the fellow that Homer is, he decides to take a short cut and dump the waste into river. Doing this makes Springfield the most polluted city in America and the evil head of the Eniviromental Protection Agency (E.P.A), uses President Schwarzenegger, to seal Springfield behind a giant dome. When the citizens of Springfield find out that Homer was the reason why Springfield became too polluted and Homer and family have to escape the town, before saving it. There are two subplots, first Bart became more hostile to Homer, and ends up befriending Flanders, wishing that he was his father. The second is Lisa ends up falling for an Irish boy, Colin, who shares a lot of interest with her, including music and their passion for the environment.There were jokes that were not very good and could easily be missed or ignored. But there were still so decent jokes, ranging from Maggie nearly fighting with Mr. Tweeny, to seeing Bart's penis (nothing like a minor bit of paedophilia (I am joking!)), to some of the verbal gags. But it still isn't great. One scene shows Homer pointing his middle fingers (flipping the bird as the Americans say), which I think never fits with the type of humour the Simpsons started out doing. The main problem with the film was that it tried to go for the widest possible audience, attempting to be too family friendly and trying to lure non-Simpsons fans, not being smart enough and relying on slapstick humour, i.e. Homer hurting himself. There was also be to much reliance on cameos, such as Green Day and Tom Hanks. However, the animation is very good, combining the traditional Simpsons style with a more cinematic style. I also like the politics satiring American politics, the media and the environment. It takes the mick out of America's attitude towards the environment, such as the negative reaction at the Green Day concert and $1000 being given to Aslakan people to destroy the natural beauty of the state (espeically where there is so little oil that it would cost more to drill out the oil then it would to make money out of it).Overall, not the best, but not the worst.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation

"Not bad...though I would rather see it on FOX, but hey it's the simpsons and their legacy would not be without a motion picture.","The Legacy of the Simpsons is that of 20 years. What began as 30-seconds on a Sunday variety show on a network that at the time was a struggling attempt at appealing to a generation of young badasses, would morph into an 18-minutes a Sunday (or thursday) of entertainment and education all rolled into one, a tradition which continues to this day and for many more. As a society, We laughed, We cried, We found hobbies, converted religions, started diets, used catch-phrases and bought so much crap all in the name of THE SIMPSONS.Now, after 20-years of hopelessly waiting and writhing, it's a film. 87 minutes, but well worth it. For you see, what would a proud tradition like the Simpsons be without this much embellishment. I will say that this was a typical Hollywood Blockbuster complete with the late John Williams and Panaflex (well it was actually animated), but hey, whatever keeps the motion picture companies.Cheers to Homer, Marge, Bart, Lisa, Maggie, Abe, and the whole town of Springfield.

It truly couldn't be any worse. If you liked it watch seasons 1-8 and then you will know why it terrible. The jokes are geared towards to teens with immature senses of humor. The biggest problem I have with this movie is when you seen Bart's private part. What is that all about.

Great entertainment!,"This is the popular animated show The Simpsons being brought to the big screen for the first time.I have never been a fan of the Simpsons, but I loved this movie! There are so many really funny jokes in the film that I laughed out so loud. The jokes are definitely better than the toilet humour as in the South Park movie. The plot is entertaining and wildly funny. I hope the American president doesn't choose policies like in the movie! Apart from being entertaining, it shows Bart wanting family warmth, and also raises awareness for environmental issues. Combining education, entertainment and family warmth is why the plot is so great! This movie is worth a watch!",,Anonymous,Animation

More Simpsons!,"Simpsons the Movie could not have been named any better than this, because it is exactly like the Simpsons we all know and love from the legendary cartoon show on TV, only longer. While this is a great thing and will surely please fans of the series -as one should not tinker with a successful formula- longer is not always better. I am not saying that the movie is bad, not at all, as I enjoyed watching it very much. However, as it is a movie in the theater I somehow expected it to be at least slightly better than the TV-show, which it is not. There are some great jokes in this movie, brought to you with the typical wittiness and silliness we know from the TV-series, but the actual story-line could not really hold my attention throughout the movie's entire 90 minutes. The Simpsons has never been big on storyline, which is perfectly fine for a TV-episode, but here the attempt to create a storyline was not that successful. Nevertheless this is the Simpsons and if you expected it to have an Oscar-winning storyline you did not pay enough attention watching the show on television.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

See it at least once,"The Simpsons Movie breaks a lot of ground for the show by doing things that the show could never hope to do such as partial 3D animation for the majority of the time and various edit-worthy bits. Some things might be shark-jump worthy for certain characters by breaking their innocence but that's probably worrying too much.There are certain characters who only get one line and some characters who speak much more than they should as well.There are lots of good jokes that are in this movie but a problem that keeps more of them from working is how horrible the timing is in this. During the show, there are points where people will take too long to react to something someone has said and that really hurts the joke. That happens a lot in this.It's not as funny as the best episodes of the show but it's far above the worst ones and worth mostly anyone's time. Worth owning?

I officially withdraw my support from this show,"At its best (circa early 90's) The Simpsons was a show possibly unmatched in its brilliance, not just for an animated show but for any comedy. 15 years or so later, and regrettably it has become one of the worst shows on television, culminating in one of the worst films I have ever seen.The film has so little redeeming value I don't know where to start. I can remember only one scene which I almost laughed and there were SEVERAL where I cringed, one comment bordering on racist. As I watched this I felt many things; mainly bored and completely patronised. The plot s utterly stupid, its not even worth analysing needless to say it was so bad that I actually stopped paying attention.The degeneration of this show couldn't have been captured more perfectly in this film. The main problem is that the characters have become so unlikeable, particularly Homer. Homer used to be lovable moron - but at the same time witty, he has become slapstick - in your face stupid, to the point of being extremely annoying - ditto Bart. The show has made the mistake of re-hashing jokes from the wrong types of characters. As many have mentioned, the token slapstick characters seem to have been given predominantly more airtime resulted further in the deterioration of the show - eg. Comic Book Guy, Cletus, cat lady and other one-card wonder characters. And is it just me or is Nelson and Ralph the too most unfunny characters - possibly in cartoon history. Can someone please write a threatening letter to Nancy Cartwright so we can just end them? Then write something scary to the writers of this film, though I'm they'll scare easy, having masterminded this abomination. Its perplexing that the show has fallen THIS far. I've lost all respect for Matt Greoning and those associated with the show since inception. How could they treat their fans with so much disdain.I actually walked out on this film, its impossible for me to express how disappointed I was or how many levels it was awful, I'd suggest you see it for yourself, if nothing other than to finally withdraw your support from this brand. Switch over to Family Guy, at least that show doesn't take itself seriously, and remembers how to write adult humour.",1.0,Anonymous,Animation
7.8/10 really??,Well don't get me wrong this is not a bad film but it's clear that fan support flatter the score.I'm a simpsons fan myself and watched the week it came out but despite some luaghs in the cinema it felt polite and out of respect.The jokes are just down right pathetic and just too slapstick trash comedy.The trailer pretty much shows the better ones or the least worse ones anyway.Spider pig? what were they thinking???? and the plot in general was a disappointment reflecting the weaknesses that the show has had in the last seasons.An example of this neglect was Mr Burns easily the most popular non Simpson character and yet he is barely mentioned which is just bizare considering he's a natural villain.On the positive side the animation is amazing and I cant remember the last time seeing a cartoon movie as most seem dominated and flooded by cgi.Overall the film just played flat and a non simpsons fan may be bored as this film struggled to fill the 87 minuites and it shows.,6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Could had used some more Spider-Pig.,"This movie started off really well and promising and seemed like an extremely entertaining animated movie, focusing on the famous animated family the Simpsons, of which the first television series episode first aired in 1989 up till still this very day. However as the movie progressed more and more problems raised.By saying the movie could had used some more Spider-Pig I don't literally mean that the movie should had featured some more of Spider-Pig (on second thought, well maybe that's also what I meant!) but more that the movie handles different plot-lines but none really gets featured or wrapped up properly. It was like the 11(!) writers of the movie each came up with a different plot-line and everything got thrown together on a pile in the end. The Homer and Bart farther son relationship, Homer and Marge's marriage crises, pollution, Lisa falling in love, it's all good but nothing gets really handled satisfying enough in the long run.Nevertheless, its very main characters and silly main plot-line make sure that ""The Simpsons Movie"" at all times remains a perfectly watchable and entertaining movie with even a couple of moments of brilliance. Especially the character Homer never seizes to amazing and entertain to the max.Also basically every other character from the Simpsons series makes an appearance in this movie, some featured obviously more prominently than others. This perhaps shall disappoint some of the fans of certain characters but good news is that this movie doesn't waste too much time on introducing any new and main characters. And why should they, when you already have Springfield filled with all kinds of colorful characters. The movie in its core is in fact about nothing else than the Simpsons family and that's also the way it should had been really.Of course they obviously had more money to spend on this movie than on the television episodes. So this can be seen in some of the more detailed animations but overall the movie maintains fairly much the same style as the television series.The humor of course also basically remains the same, although this movie goes a bit over-the-top at times in terms of how ridicules the humor gets at moments, as the story in general.Fun, though flawed, entertainment.7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
The Simpsons Movie,"The Simpsons Movie is a full length feature film based on the animated series that has become one of the longest running and most popular television shows of all time. For years the film's producers said they were going to make a movie and they finally did. Originally back in the early 90's they were going to make a movie that didn't end up happening and the idea for the movie later ended up being the Kamp Krusty episode of the series which also remains probably the episode with the shortest running time in the whole series. I have been pretty much a fan of the show from the beginning, although I do have to add that over the last few years the newer episodes with a new team of writers is just not nearly as good as the first several years of the show back in the 90's because those episodes were television gold. These new episodes seem to get more far fetched as they go along and being a fan of the absurd and weird, I usually wouldn't have a problem with that, but with the new episodes it gets to the point where it isn't clever or funny anymore and it is just ridiculous and growing out it's welcome quick. With that being said I found some things I did like about The Simpsons Movie and some things that I didn't like. It took me awhile to go into the film simply because I didn't find much or most of the film for that matter very funny at all and most of the jokes I felt just didn't deliver the punch line as it should have and after only a little while I was growing a bit restless of the film because I wasn't finding it funny, it was getting old and like the new episodes it was too unbelievable to the point of being just annoying. Also it seems over the years and with this film too that most of the humour comes from Homer Simpson doing things that are really stupid and these scenes seem to generate the most laughs. As pointed out in a special episode of the series, someone did point out that Homer seems to get dumber as the show goes on and I would have to agree and some of it just isn't funny anymore and it is getting a bit tired, old and just not as entertaining as it used to be. Those were my main complaints about the film. On the other hand, I did seem to warm up to the film in it's second half and I tended to just watch the film for what it was which is basically a long episode of the show and it's not meant for any real deep thought or purpose other than entertainment. So overall I did get into the film with it's second half and it did entertain me. However the film was still somewhat a disappointment and I wish it would have been as good as some of the original episodes from the 90's and I guess I was hoping it would be seeing as many of the original writers are back for the movie. So all in all the film was entertaining, but I was still somewhat disappointed and if there were a sequel to this movie I don't know how interested I would be in seeing it.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

"How to Extend, Expand and Humanize a Too-Familiar Cartoon for the Big Screen","Credited to no less than fifteen writers, this 2007 big-screen version of the still-running animated series (unbelievably in its 19th season) is fast, frenzied and funny. I haven't watched an episode of ""The Simpsons"" since the mid-1990's when I started to sense retread, but the movie directed by David Silverman reminds me how furiously clever the show can be with its unique mix of political incorrectness and pop-culture savvy. Moreover, at 87 minutes, or nearly four times the length of a regular episode, the plot never really flags, a startling accomplishment in itself. That's not to say the story doesn't sputter in spots from its own ambitious scope, especially in the last third, but the familiar characters seem revitalized by a plot that not only takes well-deserved potshots at organized religion and the EPA but reexamines the relationships within the nuclear family with surprising poignancy.An elaborate ""Itchy & Scratchy"" space adventure starts the movie, and then the plot begins in earnest as Green Day performs on a barge disintegrating from all the toxic substances in Lake Springfield. Community apathy has turned the once-bucolic setting into a life-threatening cesspool, reason enough for Simpson daughter Lisa to reignite her social activism. At the same time, Homer continues to eschew fatherhood, this time in favor of a pig he has decided to adopt and serenade (""Spider-Pig"" is an instant classic). He decides to accumulate the pig's waste in a gigantic silo, the aromatic ingredients of which he dumps into the lake. This sets off a natural disaster so monumental that EPA head Russ Cargill (a doppelganger for Michael Brown) quarantines the entire town under a giant dome. The townspeople of Springfield become an angry mob out to lynch Homer, and the rest of the movie follows his circuitous journey toward community responsibility and environmental awareness.Simpsons fans can rest assured that all five principal characters - Homer, Marge, Bart, Lisa and Maggie - are intact, and the voice actors have completely defined their characters with special mention going to Julie Kavner's frog-voiced drawl as Marge and Dan Castellaneta's buffoonery personified as Homer. Except for Ned Flanders, who becomes Bart's unctuously sensitive replacement father, most of the familiar supporting characters are relegated to cameos. Albert Brooks provides the voice of the Machiavellian Cargill, and Tom Hanks has a funny bit as his avuncular self. Although there are several amusing sequences, my favorite has to be the Disney-inspired foreplay scene between Homer and Marge out in the Alaskan wilderness. Most importantly, the writers successfully magnify and even exaggerate the human dimensions of these all-too-familiar characters in a way that feels fresh and textured.The primary draw of the 2007 DVD are the two commentary tracks offered - the first with producer and series creator James L Brooks, Simpsons creator Matt Groening among others and the second a more technically oriented discussion with Silverman and several of the sequence directors. The first track is the one to experience since they stop the film for more specific discussion of key sequences, which extends the film's running time by fifteen minutes. Otherwise, there are less than ten minutes of deleted scenes and special features. Series fans won't be disappointed and the rest of us can enjoy the movie, too.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

The film goes right back to the way the simpsons were at their peek.There are a few cheesy parts, where i thought ""this is a bit gay"", however, as soon as anything like this happens, the film cuts it out.

A disgrace to one of the best loved TV pieces of all time,"The Simpsons. A show, no, a TV revolution, loved by so many. I, like many other Simpsons fans have watched the shows demise over the past few years. The Simpons was never just a TV show for me, it was a representation of society, it was clever, it was witty, it was sarcastic, it was satirical, it was layered, it was 'real' - at least as real as an animated TV show can get.I was hoping so dearly that the movie would capture some of what The Simpsons used to do for us.My God. I don't even know where to start when describing this movie. I grew up with The Simpsons, it almost seems wrong to admit how awful this movie was. NO, I can't keep quiet, this movie was HORRIBLE.It pains me to see reviews stating that ""any real Simpsons fan will love this movie."" What a load of tripe. Any REAL Simpsons fan will see this movie as the final nail in the coffin of a masterpiece that should have gone out on top, a disgrace to one of the best loved TV comedy pieces of all time.This movie was targeted at morons who have no idea what humour is. The kind of idiots who'll find terrible slapstick, forced 1 liners and bumbling fools falling over 'hilarious'. Dumbed down would be an understatement. Even the potentially humorous moments in the movie were ruined by overly long build-ups and predictable executions. Any intelligence and satire that the Simpsons used to portray is nowhere to be found in this pile of cheap hogwash.This movie is NOT The Simpsons, in the same way recent TV seasons aren't either. At least the TV series will occasionally pay homage to its former self. It may have the same yellow characters on screen, but this may as well have been a completely new animated family (and the family is the only thing you'll see on screen throughout the movie) - oh wait, that wouldn't sell.The entire movie follows the family around, most of which pointlessly takes place outside of Springfield. There is ONE 'story' going on throughout the 90 minutes, rather than two or more intertwining with each other like on the show (and I firmly believe this was one of the shows most valuable characteristics). The story itself is atrocious. It contains no solid or believable plot, utterly forced jokes and things we've seen done in the show a dozen times, void of any of the shows charm.The sub-plots in the movie fail to even materialise. ""Lisa and Colin"", ""Bart and Flanders""? These were impossibly frustrating to watch and went nowhere.It seems the movie has tried to copy Family Guy and failed miserably. Instead of seeing Homer as a cute, unlucky, lovable character, he's been turned into a vulgar, loud-mouthed yob. Bart's no longer a brat  he's been turned into some kind of emotional, frustrated kid who isn't happy with his father. What on Earth? Family Guy on the other hand knows what it is  it IS crude and vulgar, but it does it well. The Simpsons, though, seems to be lost and has no idea of its own identity.It's a real shame that The Simpsons has had to end up where it is. As far as I, a real Simpsons fan, am concerned, this movie isn't part of the Simpsons I love, and I'll always remember the show for what it was and represented to me.",4.0,Anonymous,Animation

Endlessly watchable,"The Simpsons Movie finds one of the quintessential American satires mostly operating on peak form whilst making the transition to big screen look effortless. It's a laugh a minute experience for the first half and the second half still has plenty of great moments so its slightly weaker nature doesn't derail it. Like all the strongest films that come from TV shows, it makes sure to give its main characters an arc the show can't.Few actors have been voicing their characters for as long as the core cast have here, which enables them to pick it up effortlessly and most of the best characters get something worthwhile. Dan Castellaneta remains endearingly stupid as Homer and that stupidity gives him a lot of laughs as he takes most of the film to realise the error of his ways. Albert Brooks is a really good villain whose voice naturally fits his character.David Silverman's direction never wastes a second as there are loads of visual gags that it trusts you to understand and it's really impressive how it's able to get away with some of them in a PG rating plus the dialogue is almost as witty. The instantly recognizable animation gets a real upgrade that has never been surpassed, even in later seasons. Also, the end credits get to properly showcase how multi-talented the cast are by showing how many characters most of them do.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Good But not Great,"Lets face it The Simpsons belongs on TV in 20 min episodes and thats where its finest moments can be found.

Homer is hilariously stupid and steals the film. Shame some of the supporting characters don't get more air time though. I wanted to see Mr. Burns more as well as Apu, Sideshow Bob and several others who were barely seen. The first part of the film is good but the middle part isn't that funny. It does pick up towards the end but never reaches the pinnacle of the best Simpsons episodes. I think they should have worried less about having a plot and spent more time writing those great gags.

Instead of being created with the production value of the classics, what was delivered was a lengthened, stupefied version of a new episode.The movie contains none of the classic approaches to comedy, such as when Homer is sent under water to find the Lock Ness Monster and turns out to be playing an arcade game (episode: Monty Can't Buy Me Love); or when Homer tackles Mr. Bont (please research 'Mr Bont' before you post you’re foreseeable predictable ignoramus remarks) resulting in his death (episode: You Only Move Twice). Both of these episodes contain random comedy scenes that are within the flow and storyline of the episode. It is almost like there is nothing random actually going on.The movie uses an approach to random comedy that is more reminiscent of a bad rip off of ‘Family Guy’. There are some references to past episodes, and a couple of classic Simpsons comedy scenes, but nowhere near enough to redeem the rather lacking story line. I’m still unsure if I like the animation used (i.e. the shadows and closer to 3D shading). For these reasons I have rated the Simpsons Movie low and don’t ever want to see it again.",2.0,Anonymous,Animation
how sad.....,"How sad to see what was once a witty, exceptionally creative well run so horribly dry. There are some chuckles, but almost any earlier Simpsons' TV episode (the latter seasons continue a fairly steady nosedive)would blow this insult to fans off the planet. The animation has more angles and camera moves but the wry wit is long gone. Having the Simpson's swear or give the finger just dumbs it all down even more. A pity. What could have been a well crafted gift to the long standing fans arrives like a used knick knack from a dollar store. It's already performing incredibly at the box office so a sequel is perhaps a definite. But lets hope they bring back the original writers. Or make a two hour ""Tree House Of Horror"" episode (though even those have lost their spark in recent seasons), which couldn't possibly be as bland as this film. Let's hope.",,Anonymous,Animation
Works better as a TV show than a movie,"I want to start off by saying that I did like this movie, and I am a huge fan of The Simpsons. However, the things that have made The Simpsons a great show, and one of the most successful in television history, don't necessarily translate onto the big screen.The plot, while absolutely hilarious in some scenes, seemed forced in many other scenes, leaving me with a disjointed feeling in the film. From what I understand the script underwent several revisions over a period of few years, so that might explain much of that feeling that I got. It may also be that the writers have been in television for so long that writing a movie script was a little bit more than they could pull off.With all that said, I did like the movie, just not as much as the show. The animation was sharp, and the characters were true to form. Perhaps though my expectation was set a little bit too high.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
A good film!,"Simpson the movie is a very good movie; it's about the Simpsons family who lives in Springfield. I like the movie and think its funny. The movie is about the Simpsons and their hometown Springfield, one day, the town recognized that the cities lake is poisoned whit garbage and toxic waste. The city decides to block of the lake, but Homer Simpson don't care and dumps a septic tank with waste from his pig, the whole town goes mad. At the same time, USA decides to close in Springfield in a huge dome with a little hole at the top, so the toxic wont spread. Maggie, the youngest kid in the family, sits and plays in her sandbox and suddenly, she's on the other side of the dome, the family is chased by the whole town because of Homer and they have to hide, so the family runs to Alaska.My opinion is that the movie is good, there's happening things time after time and that's the best with it, I don't think it should happened things all the time because a movie needs to slow down to be good, otherwise maybe the one who watches the movie goes hyper and can't focus on the movie. So I think it's good to have parts in the movie when it's calm. I also like that they did a movie, so it not only elementary with the TV program, which is also very good.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Decent, not a classic","Before I start, let me say that I grew up with the Simpsons, and consider it the greatest animated series of all time. There was a time in my life when I absolutely would not ever dare to ever miss a new episode, and would then meet up with friends the next day to rehash the funniest parts. Part of what made the series so hilarious was Homers' utter irresponsibility, naïveté, and failure as a role model. (His response to a question about why he litters: ""It's easier. Duh."") Bart was also a total brat who would steal things, vandalize, and get in trouble at school. It was one of the few animated programs on at night instead of Saturday mornings (there are far more today, however). It was wildly popular. I can still remember way back to the ads they ran for the second half of the ""Who shot Mr. Burns?"" episode (real people off the street were being interviewed on who they though the killer was).The Simpsons is a truly excellent series, but one that should have been ended around the years 2000-2001. The creators of Seinfeld knew to quit while they were ahead. The Simpsons, unfortunately, is not the show it used to be. Granted, it would be impossible for it to be the same after so many years and hundreds of episodes, but that's the reason why most television series eventually have to end. In the ""Poochie"" episode, Lisa makes the same point about the Itchy and Scrachy show to a man wanting feedback: ""Um, excuse me sir. The thing is, there's not really anything wrong with the Itchy & Scratchy show, it's as good as ever. But after so many years, the characters just can't have the same impact they once had."" This is a pretty good summary of the gradual decline in quality the Simpsons has been experiencing.I first saw a teaser ad for The Simpsons movie sometime in late 2005 or early 2006, I believe. I thought right off the bat that it was a bad idea. South Park and Beavis & Butt-Head had churned out movies relatively quickly, when the characters and material were still fresh, which was the wise thing to do. If there was ever a time for a Simpsons movie, it would have been in the mid-to-late 90's.Nonetheless, I knew I was going to be dragged to the movie by my friends one way or the other. I went hoping for the best, and was even excited that I would at least get to see The Simpsons on the big screen.So how did things turn out? Well, it at least kept me entertained and involved throughout, and it was better than I expected it to be. It's nowhere near the hilarity of the show at its peak, but far better than the most recent episodes. The first half hour is particularly decent, because it's close to an early Simpsons episode.While I of course enjoyed the mocking of the US government, I have to admit that I just didn't really care for the ""sealed in a dome"" story and wish they had come up with a different plot. It seemed like they just wanted the most ""huge,"" ""epic"" plot ever, so they came up with the dome thing. But the stories on the show were rarely ""epic."" They were totally asinine and got laughs because of the ridiculous behavior of the characters (like when Homer and Bart make ""garbage angels"" on the floor of their living room). You have to wonder what kind of opportunities they missed by introducing such a gargantuan idea for a plot. Oh well.The Simpsons movie is an easy and fun watch, but by the time the credits roll you realize how underwhelming it is. Maybe I'm being too hard on it, because my expectations were so high, but dangit's The Simpsons movie, man!! Ah well. It still has its moments. Who can possibly keep a straight face when Moe yells, ""The top of his head is showing! Claw at it!"" Not me.All in all, while not a classic, The Simpsons movie will probably keep most fans entertained throughout.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Something for EVERY Simpsons Fan!,"First of all, let me start by saying that I was definitely planning on waiting for the DVD of this movie. I was convinced that I wouldn't be missing anything that I could see every night for free! Alas, the trailers were relentless, and mercilessly drug me out to the local movie house. Boy, am I glad I didn't wait! There was so much big screen goodness you could not possibly look away! Believe me, if you ever loved The Simpsons, from their humble beginnings on the Tracy Ullman show up to now, you will like this big screen treat! Even though it had just a tad of ""PG-13 naughtiness"", it wasn't enough to keep the whole family away. All ages in my theater were laughing up a storm, including me! Congratulations to the writers for maintaining Homer's ""nuclear dad"" image as well! This was his best performance yet! You can easily get caught up trying to recognize the whole population of Springfield, or picking out all of the props from previous episodes or just sitting back and enjoying the plot(there actually WAS one!!). Anyway you approach it. There is something for EVERY Simpsons fan in this movie, so if you've ever liked them, what are you waiting for??",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
just great,"For years, there had been speculation as to whether or not there would be a big screen version of the longest running animated show. Well, now it's, and I gotta say that I really like ""The Simpsons Movie"". With just the right balance of gags and plot line, they keep the whole thing going.The story has Lisa exposing - via a presentation called ""An Irritating Truth"" - that Lake Springfield's pollution levels will reach catastrophic levels unless the people take serious action immediately. While the city bans dumping, Homer tosses his pet pig's crap into the lake - he was taking the crap to the treatment facility, but had to get to Lard Lad Donuts for a free donut - turning Springfield into the most polluted city in the country. So, EPA head Russ Cargill (voice of Albert Brooks) gets Pres. Schwarzenegger to agree to put a giant glass dome over Springfield to prevent it from polluting the rest of the country (while also removing Springfield from all maps). Sure enough, news soon comes out that Homer is responsible for the city's misfortune, and the family has to flee through a sinkhole. Now comes the question of how Homer is going to deal with the mess that he's created.Pretty much every major character from throughout the show's history appears in at least one scene. Along the way, there are some great lines (""Why are we watching something in the theater that we could watch for free on TV?""). The subplots involve Lisa's crush on Irish immigrant boy Colin, and Bart viewing Ned Flanders as a father figure, while Marge and Maggie also do their usual stuff.Yes, maybe it is a little late for the movie to arrive, but I still assert that they did a near perfect job. Really funny. And just remember what Tom Hanks said in his guest appearance.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
The Simpsons Movie Review by Metallic Orb,"The production of this movie has been contemplated since 1990 by Simpsons creator Matt Groening. He often said that the making of a Simpsons movie would result in the end of the series. This is not the case. The series has been renewed for at least another 4 seasons.My greatest fear was that this movie would ruin the series. Luckily this did not happen. The first twenty minutes of the film are completely brilliant.My second greatest concern was the development of an animated TV series into a feature length film. It is difficult to stretch slapstick humor and witty phrases that often depend on commercial breaks for their full effect into something that will work in a film. I believe The Simpsons Movie accomplished this. The viewer must keep in mind that the film is indeed a movie and so longer dialogs should be expected in order to fully develop the plot. This is one way in which the movie varies from the TV series.Following the tradition of social commentary in the series, there is an overarching theme in the film of being conscious about how we treat the environment. Green Day guest stars in the film and there is a special cameo appearance by a big name Hollywood star that you will all recognize. Most of your favorite Simpsons characters will be seen in the film as well as a few new ones like the ""Big Boob Medicine Woman"" and ""President Arnold Schwarzenegger."" Aside from some full frontal nudity, expletives and Homer flipping the bird, this movie is a solid extension of the series and must be seen by any casual Simpsons viewer for its fast-paced humor, clever commentary about our society and the opportunity to finally see all of your favorite Simpsons characters on the big screen! Enjoy the film and let me know what you think!",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Greatest Movie in the History of History,"As anyone who has read even a single solitary post on this website knows, I am a pretty big Simpsons fan. Nearly every joke I've written on this website has been a twisted version of something I heard on the Simpsons, made less funny and claimed as my own without even realizing I had stole it. I have seen every episode of the show numerous times and annoyingly recite lines from it amongst my friends. I feel as though I know the characters on that show as well as I know people in real life. I believe it is the funniest television show in the existence of forever and the absolute apex of achievement by man (slightly ahead of Tecmo Super Bowl...slightly). That's why when I first heard the movie was being made over a year ago I was worried. I thought this movie reeked of a cash grab by a show on the decline that was looking for one last big financial windfall before riding off into the sunset. I was worried because I had waited 18 of my 23 years for this movie to come out and there was no possible way it could meet the ridiculous expectations I had created for it. I was wrong. The Simpsons movie was the most exhilarating experience of my life. It was like being conscious during your own birth and realizing all of the wonder and magnificence that awaited you during your new lifetime. If you compiled every great thing that Frank Capra, John Ford, Stanley Kubrick and Woody Allen ever put to film and then multiplied it by a number so large that saying it would take a lifetime you still wouldn't even be close to how great this movie is. Jesus Christ himself could have come bursting through the theater doors riding a surfboard on a wave of fire, carrying the head of Satan in one hand and shooting a shotgun into the air with the other and I still wouldn't have been able to turn away from the brilliance that was occurring on screen and if that last sentence didn't make sense to you then you haven't seen the film yet. That's how amazing this movie is. I don't know how more highly I could recommend it. But if you want to have your life changed for the best then go see this movie. Right now. And when you're done watching it watch it again. Please.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Just a stretched out episode,"And not a particularly good one. The animation was better and there was some of the usual humor but it really had no more laughs than most of the episodes. I can't imagine it that it would have taken them any longer than two weeks to write it. Most of the funnier moments have already been shown in the trailers. This is one of my favorite TV shows but as a movie it left me looking for more. It isn't as though they have to surpass the series with some kind of masterpiece, but any fan of the TV show will be hard pressed to say they don't recall several episodes that were funnier than this movie. They did nothing different except to extend the scenes a bit more than the TV show. I recommend you wait and RENT IT!",6.0,Anonymous,Animation

"It Struck Me, CLOSE to HOME!","Normally, I don't watch the Simpson cartoons and I wasn't interested in watching this movie, but my wife was with me, so we decided to watch it, together.However, this movie was very different... My wife noticed that I became emotional during the movie... I told her that the movie reminded me of my life, growing up in the USA. How Homer treated Bart was very, very similar to how my dad treated me during my younger days. I told my wife that this movie reminded me of my past life in the USA. --- Nowadays, my dad (living in Seattle, WA USA) stays close to me, even though I am now living in Manila, Philippines.Other than that, my wife said I act like Homer Simpson. Well, I don't think I do, but she said I do.Considering I was living my 1st 35 years in the USA, I was telling my wife that the attitudes expressed in the Simpsons movie is very close to reality in America. The movie is intended on being funny, it's really a reality to those that live in the USA. I've lived in Anchorage, Alaska, USA, too. My friends and relatives thought all of the movie was made up, but I told them that I remember the announcement, many years ago, that the Simpsons cartoon will be made into a movie.Overall, I don't recommend this movie for young children because of the drama within.

Best Movie Ever,"News reports and critics may have their doubts, but The Simpsons Movie could be the best animated movie yet.Some viewers got upset that some characters were missing, but if we put every Simpsons character there ever was in that movie it'd probably get pointless sooner or later, because they'd have a hard time squeezing in every character.The commercials and trailers are NOT the only funny parts in the movie. When I got out of the theater, it reeked of pee yet I didn't mind because I didn't blame anybody for laughing so hard. If you're thinking, 'This must be stupid because why would Homer get a pig named Plopper?' or 'Why is everyone staying mad at Homer all of the sudden when he messes up in every episode anyway?' but I have to tell you that there are reasons for all of your critical questions.I'm not going to tell you any of the things about the movie.

"Longer Than a TV Episode, But No Better","This review assumes you know about the Simpson's TV show. If you don't, then the humor in the movie is probably not going to be appreciated. If you are familiar with Homer, Bart and the whole cast of Springfield then don't expect an extravaganza. Homer sums up my feelings about the movie during the introduction. Since it's one of the better comedic lines, I won't give it away.The movie fails to be an epic worthy of the big screen. It's an entertaining movie, it just doesn't rise far enough above the weekly TV show to earn a higher rating.Do expect cursing. Do expect cartoon nudity. Do expect a lot of cameos and reappearances of past characters. Do go expecting to laugh. The problem is that the story is too similar to every other Simpson's episode I've ever seen. Every dramatic device used in the movie has become just a repeat of things we've seen before. In many cases the episodes were better than the movie. It is also disappointing that the trailer reveals too many of the laughs. It would be easier to appreciate some scenes if they had been a surprise.If you are a big fan of the Simpsons, go see it in the theater. If you aren't, wait for the DVD or skip it altogether.

A return to the satire and wit that made the TV show so memorable in the first place,"It should come as no surprise to anyone that The Simpsons Movie is as hyped or anticipated as it is. After eighteen seasons, the show still pulls in decent and consistent ratings, and even though the quality of the show has fallen a bit by the wayside the past few years, it will still rule supreme as one of the most popular television series' of all time. But with dodgy episodes as of late (and by late, I mean at least the last five years), the real question was whether or not the film would suffer.Thankfully, it seems, the writers were waiting for something like this to truly let the show and its characters shine.Curiously, the trailers are very cryptic as to what the film is actually about. I found out a few days before, and I think it ruined a few of the surprises that were in store. But for the most part, for all Simpsons fans young and old, be prepared for a treat.Yes, the film does feel like an overextended episode, but not in the traditional sense. Whereas the Family Guy DVD movie literally felt like three episodes of the show strewn together, The Simpsons Movie actually makes a point of allowing the entirety of the film to feel cohesive and all so very attached to itself. Of course, this also means that it did not truly stretch the fabric confines of what is allowed in a movie as opposed to what is allowed on television (save for some extra violence, a few casual swear words, and one very bizarre skateboard-related dare). But while this element helped the South Park film become the controversial musical epic that it was back in 1998, I think it would have worked against The Simpsons.By making it very in tune with the TV show, and feeling like it could stand side-by-side just about any episode, it is a true ode to the fans, and to all people who just loved watching the show in its prime. Loaded to the max with references to pop culture and even the series itself, it truly is a blast to watch for anyone who catches the random episodes shown every hour of every day.The story, for what little amount of story there is, is fairly intriguing and a lot different than I envisioned it (even with knowing a little more about it). The many writers have clearly understood what worked and what did not over the entire Simpsons run, and have constructed what I would believe is a new rendition of the olden style. It feels like an old Simpsons episode, but we know it has been created now, during the slump of creativity where the show is concerned. I always hoped that they were saving all the good ideas for the movie, and with a few exceptions, I think I was right. It is better written, better voice-acted (everyone is back, and everyone is just as good as ever), and so much funnier than anything that has come out of that camp since at least the early 2000's. There are moments where I laughed so hard, that I forgot I was watching a Simpsons cartoon as new as this. And even when the comedic moments fall flat on their face, it still comes off as something worth a smile.The animation is an interesting case all in itself. While the characters are animated using traditional hand-drawn techniques, all of the backgrounds are clearly computer-generated. It works in instances where the characters are just talking or when they are moving around normally, but it looks a little bizarre during scenes with excessive movement (the mob scene in the trailers is one such example). It gets a little jagged, and the hand-drawn stuff just does not look proper in any of these scenes. One small scene close to the end of the film, with Homer dreaming, just looks horrendous with the combination of traditional and computer animation. It just does not work together, and I think it may have been better off to just stick with traditional animation for the entirety of the film (since computer generated versions of The Simpsons clan would have truly been one of the worst moves in film history if it were to have been done). I liked that the creators experimented with such a process, but it just looks like it should have been done a little differently.But I cannot help but feel that this film may truly be the swansong for The Simpsons. With it being handled so well, and actually edging back into the satirical wit the show once had, the film feels a lot more like a goodbye than anything. By bringing everyone together like this, it makes me imagine that the creators are trying to come up with the most proper goodbye that anyone could imagine for these insanely popular characters. It truly was a collaborative effort, and it shows in how much works in the movie, and how much no longer works so well on the show. After years of waiting, the creators finally delivered on a promise first thought-up in the early 1990's, and it will be worth the wait for many fans. But if this not the way they were figuring they would go out, than what is? Should I start getting excited for what may be in store for this family of five in the future, or should I stay content that the filmmakers actually pulled of the movie, and truly made it great?Whatever the answer, the wait is over, and fans should rejoice. The Simpsons Movie is funny, sweet, tender, and all so entertaining. It is exactly what we have been waiting for, and almost no one should be disappointed by the final result.8.5/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
"The Simpsons: Bigger, Longer and unbelievably: Uncut!","So here it is then; The Simpsons finally do a film. I've been a big fan for years and years; frequently watching repeats on television of old episodes I know inside out yet haven't seen for ages. Usually, I don't watch animated films beyond Disney although the South Park film (1999) was a refreshing alternative. It took the makers of South Park a mere two years to adapt their characters into a film, something that took everything great about the series but moved up a level in the fact it didn't censor out any swearing, profanity or violence. Bearing everything else in mind, how does the Simpson's film shape up? Pretty damn good, on the whole.You get the feeling that the creators are trying to grow the series up a little bit  South Park and Japanese animation as a whole helped move that tag 'cartoons are for kids' away from animation and The Simpsons are also following suit as there are several things in this you'd never get in an episode on TV. These would include but probably aren't limited to: nudity, drug taking and swearing using hand gestures; Marge even refers to Lisa as a 'woman' about a fifth of the way through.Along with this, the film manages to capture what actually made the series so great and adapt it in a friendly and satisfactory way; there is no plot to start out with (in fact there is no real plot come the end) and thus it plays out like 'just another day in Springfield' as Homer carries out his chores, Lisa goes from door to door telling people about the environment and Bart gets involved in a game of 'truth or dare'. In all honesty, the opening twenty minutes was brilliant  laugh after laugh to any Simpsons fan who has been following the show for the duration I have as the film covers an array of characters and deals with a string of funny situations. Certain people who have certain favourite characters will be disappointed theirs didn't get enough screen time but from memory; Chief Wiggum, Cletus and Ned Flanders get the bulk of the screen time. This is not to be frowned at though as pretty much every character gets at least one joke to themselves, Moe's being particularly funny.When it comes to the famous family themselves, Maggie seems to get more screen time than Lisa which although sounds rather daft is actually genius as Maggie can't speak and thus, has to rely on her actions to act as the comedy which she does to very good effect. Lisa's time is more dedicated to a romance story which I will not spoil.The film gets going through an extremely unfortunate event that only really highlights Homer's stupidity and lack of thinking, thus making him look more like a buffoon than anything else; but once this happens you can feel it going down an extremely alternate route to that of the cartoon series. For reasons I shall not say, the rest of Springfield's characters are merely tossed aside meaning the bulk consists of The Simpsons so prepare yourself for that. This is a shame as with so many colourful characters to work with, dismissing them seemed rather ruthless but it is 'The Simpsons Movie' after all, not 'Springfield: The Movie'.Like I mentioned, the plot as a whole is weak and numerous little occurrences merely kick-start the film once again after it hits a groove it could so easily fall into and stay in. This includes but again, is not limited to Marge discovering something on the news about Springfield resulting in them having to travel back once they bed down in Alaska; something that didn't really seem to contain anything of note plot wise. Also, the humour once in Alaska is limited to things like avalanches, Bart taking up drinking and spoofs of Disney characters from films made 60 years ago.Once the film beds into its final third, the familiar Hollywood routine kicks in but I think the makers only wanted to finish on a strong, positive note and what better way to do so than using the familiar 'Happy, Hollywood ending'. This isn't a criticism but it does leave you with an odd feeling in the pit of your stomach  maybe it's just the fact that The Simpsons are actually in a film and are thus able to even HAVE a happy, Hollywood ending. It's difficult to say too many bad things about something I love so dear (The TV series) but despite really trying to love it (maybe too much), the film was only so much as a funny, big screen outing for the family of five that are: The Simpsons.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
As good as donuts...,"The Simpsons Movie had some big shoes to fill. Coming from what has to be one of the most popular TV shows in American history, what would the movie be like? Given the bar set by similar TV-to-Movie adaptations, apprehension as to whether the movie would work or flop were obvious.It worked. In the first 20 minutes of the movie, there was never a silent moment in the audience as the crowd laughed and laughed. Stunt after stunt hit the mark with perfect timing, and the movie was off to a wonderful start.A bit slow in the middle, the movie moved into the development of a decent plot, with the story of the struggles of the Simpsons family, and Springfield in general (and yes, the movie places where Springfield is geographically...well, sorta).What one word could I use to describe this movie? Timing. Timing of the jokes and stunts; transition from the slapstick fun of the first part of the movie into the slower plot development; at a mere 87 minutes, timing of when to end; timing in all aspects was near perfect.At the end of the movie was something I haven't heard in several years, audience applause...and in case it isn't obvious, stay for the closing credits.Oh, of course, the single word uttered by Maggie at the end with her pacifier finally removed: ""Sequel"".In the words of Homer Simpson near the beginning of the movie, ""Why would anyone pay money to see in the theaters what they could watch for free at home?"".

Good but nothing you haven't seen before,"It's been a long time coming but finally after 18 years of the Simpsons we get the long overdue movie. Is this a case of the horse having already bolted from the stable? Well, a little bit but to be fair after 18 years of material coming up with new stuff is going to be difficult and while the Simpsons movie does admirably to entertain for it's short running time it feels like little more than an extended episode with one or two bits of obviously superior animation.The plot is nothing more than what we'd expect from an episode of the show but being movie length means that Groening and co can stuff more than the usual amount of Simpsons tomfoolery into the bits between the plot. Just about every single regular character ever from the Simpsons mythos gets at least a cameo look in although shame on Groening and co for giving Mr Burns such a stupidly small part in the movie. There are a good few belly laughs throughout the movie including a few that take more than the usual ""Shown in TV land before the watershed"" risks.It's unfortunate that after so many years of the Simpsons some of the gags are getting a bit predictable (not to mention recycled) but it's to the shows credit that even those bit's are still funny a lot of the time. I mean Homer's as much the clueless buffoon as he ever was which is always funny right. I was surprised that the movie didn't take more shots at pop culture but I guess thats a good way to date a movie quickly so maybe they deliberately chose not to go down that road.If I was rating this movie alongside the series I'd say it was at least as good as one of the better than average episodes but a long way off the really good ones......",6.0,Anonymous,Animation

Disappointing,"After watching Simpsons religiously for about the past 10 or 11 years I was somewhat disappointed with this film. The series has in my opinion unfortunately been going down hill over the last few years and unfortunately the movie has fallen into the same traps.The movie started out really funny, but lost momentum as time went on. Like so many TV series that are turned into feature length films, it didn't really work, tended to be dragged out and many of the episodes from TV were much better.As others have said, maybe they should have stopped making Simpsons when it was still on a high.I went into the cinema with the anticipation of seeing a brilliant movie, but came disappointed and the thought that it could have been so much better.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
All can burn in hell,What the hell how can anyone bitch about this movie any real simpsons fan knows that as much as we dreamed of a movie and it finally came we would never be happy we all have our views and ideas that it should be this and that well guess what none of us write for the simpsons and thank god cause that is why the show works cause as we should easily see we as fans already think we know what would make it work and yet we can't even agree on a movie I am so glad we do not have that power and the creating is left to who it is and has been cause myself included could not do what they have done for record and record on end so who the hell cares about one or another comic book guy want to be's thats all you are so instead of bitching non stop be thankful we have something you can even bitch about and to prove my point we all have something we wanted more I wanted more MR.Burns but guess what the movie was awesome at the least you got 90 mins without commercials so shut up,10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Yes it is ten times Homer-er,"Thank God this Movie did not disappoint.It was funny from start to finish and thankfully gets back to it's yellow roots that made the Simpsons pop culture icons.The plot is simple enough but what a great idea. It was nice to see Homer being himself and not a bad ""Family Guy"" wannabe. There was nothing corny, hokey, or just plain stupid as there has been in the darker moments of the T.V series.Still, it does not quite measure up to the glory days of say ""A Street Car Named Marge"" or the ""Power Plant Strike"" but it does come darn close.The reason that I only rated it a 7 and not higher is that for my money, the movie was actually too short. The writers easily had another half hour out of the material. Some characters were underutilized and some not at all.Still ""Don't have a cow man!"" The Simpson's Movie is ""Dar-diddly-arn good""",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
doh!!,I am going to be brutally honest here. The jokes were not as funny as in the TV series. There were scenes you could tell were added just to fit the joke that you knew was coming. There was also too many lull moments. At the scene where Homer watches the video tape of Marge i told myself OK enough is enough. I wanted to rate this movie high because the TV series never let me down and i figured it would get better...but it didn't.The movie however was good and just funny enough to hold my attention till the end. 6 out of 10Long live the Simpsons,6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Amusingly Funny & Clever,"PROS(no spoilers)= All over, a movie that is guaranteed to make anyone laugh. (I Laughed so much my mouth ended up hurting from all the laughing). Most people are concerned and 'hesitate' to watch this movie because they are afraid it will be similar to the new series, which are somewhat not as funny and clever as the older seasons. The movie is not like the new series, instead it's funny just like the old ones; just with newer & brighter animation which was done superbly well. Its clear this movie is a massive hit and will continue to make it big when it comes out on DVD etc. Put simply, this movie is not a flop in away.CONS(no spoilers)= The only thing i can think of is that they didn't show enough of Patty and selma and burns which are personally favorites of mine, but other than that the movie is is excellent.END: If anyone is going to complain about the movie, youl notice it will be pity, so don't worry about them.

A big relief for those expecting the worst!,"It's the event 18 years in the making. For lifelong fans of ""The Simpsons"" on TV, this could very well be the event of the year. Yet the negative word that has haunted the film from day one is the noticeable decline in quality over the past few years. Would the team be able to fight this and successfully expand the show into 90 minutes of pure Simpsons magic, or would it merely be a longer retread of recent episodes? The answer lies somewhere in between; while it by no means reaches the comedic heights of the series' early years, THE SIMPSONS MOVIE is an enjoyable, laugh-filled film that passes by in no time and leaves the viewer satisfied.The film format and PG-13 rating have allowed for many ""shock"" laughs, the most effective of which is used quite early in the film. It's a joke that's bound to upset the parents; for a brief moment, we are reminded of the edgier days when the Simpsons team was called on for public apologies. But the formula of joke after joke begins to falter; the film begins to drag near its middle, the gags become repetitive and more typical of recent episodes. When the jokes fail (more often than not, they are the jokes used in the many previews; by now, they've lost their humor), the film seems to die a bit. While the pace picks up as the film reaches its finale, it never quite recreates the edgy joy the writers clearly felt when they weren't restrained to a plot. The film also attempts a number of large action sequences, poking fun at the summer blockbuster while trying to gain some excitement in its own right. These become a mixed blessing; the expanded, almost epic scope is neat for a while, but the film only comes alive when it returns to the suburban-level comedy it knows best.What is quite surprising about this film is the level of honesty and seriousness it portrays. Unlike other comedies of its type, ""The Simpsons"" has always seemed earnest, especially when it concerns Homer and Marge. But here they break new ground; a videotaped monologue by Marge halfway through the film may be the most dramatic thing they've ever attempted, and it pays off. In those few moments, THE SIMPSONS MOVIE becomes truly dramatic, almost heartbreaking. It was a risky move to implement such a dramatic element in such a film, yet it is a complete triumph.The film never reaches the heights of the series as a whole; there are no instantly classic lines, and the filmmakers struggle to create a thoroughly involving 90-minute film, but it is far from a disaster. Actually, the greatest achievement here may be the further characterization of the dynamic Simpson family themselves. Moments of brilliance early in the film show why the Simpsons have lasted all these years, and the rest of the film is solid enough to make THE SIMPSONS MOVIE a successful TV-to-film transfer.Read more at http://newmanscorner.blogspot.com",6.0,Anonymous,Animation

"""How Did The Pig Tracks Get On The Ceiling?""","Homer, Marge, Bart, Lisa and Maggie original debuted as super-short spots on the popular TRACEY ULLMAN SHOW in 1987--and proved so popular that they soon graduated to their own series, THE SIMPSON, on Fox. A mixture of zany action and pop culture satire, the show was a huge hit--and some twenty years later is still going strong.THE SIMPSONS MOVIE finds the family in their usual spate of comic chaos, including Grandpa's prophecy at church and Homer's acquisition of a pet pig. Unfortunately, when Homer dumps a silo full of pig crap into Lake Springfield, rendering it toxic, he attracts the attention of the EPA and makes Grandpa's prophecy come true. Is Springfield domed? Er, doomed? There's a lot to like about THE SIMPSONS MOVIE. It's well crafted, the characters have lots of off-the-wall bits, and when it scores it scores big. But series fan who complain that the series has lost some steam over the years have a point: although its amusing and clever and lots of fun, The Simpsons just don't have the same bite they did back in the day--and this is as true of the film as it is of the series. It's more akin to the pop culture it mocks than to the satire-sharp show it used to be.The DVD release, which is available in both full screen and widescreen, comes with several bonuses. The audio tracks are inconsistently interesting, but the rest is enjoyable. D'oh! GFT, Amazon Reviewer",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
boring and un-simpson-like,"The weird experinece of seeing the simpsons on the silver screen was indeed weird, and therefore I think it would have been best that the simpsons stay on the small screen.The film won't do anything special for the series, and after waiting 18 years for it, personally, I think that the creators have made a mistake, its just like 4 episodes strung together! With a bit of fancy camera-work, slightly souped up animation and as many one liners and gags the wirters can think of! No matter how hard the writers try don't they realise it's likely they will never reach the comedy gold of the first 8 seasons? Those seasons didn't rely on slapstick as much, and crappy and unimaginative one liners, just what this film relys on.It's obvious this film will do very well at the box office, and thats fine with me, the simpsons is a worldwide phenomenon, it's just the quality of the seasons has steadily got worse and now this. Come on Matt, your show has had its day, it's made millions and is internationally successful, why almost ruin it with this? For god's sake don't make a sequel.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
Unlike The Series You Can Only Enjoy This Once,"I must say I'm disappointed with this movie. First of all it was just 77 minutes long, minus the credits. Second of all there were very few jokes and probably just one or two of them made me laugh. It seemed like the writers of this movie tried to make it among the main audience and didn't care about the hardcore Simpsons fans.I was expecting a lot of hidden jokes just for us hardcore fans but I couldn't find them. There were just old Homer-makes-a-dumb-mistake jokes. I would like to see more parodies of movies. And I don't mean new movies but old ones, let's say from 70's to 90's. There were some, like the Titanic parody in the beginning, but very few.I'm also disappointed that the smaller characters didn't get that much space in the movie. I would really like more Moe, Krusty, Willy, Apu and Wiggum. Since this movie was so short I guess they didn't have time. But that could have been solved by, let's say, making this movie 30 minutes longer? I read a interview with Matt Groening a couple of days before the premiere of the movie which made me really optimistic about the movie. He said that there were so many jokes they wanted in the movie but they only chose the best ones. But I guess they only had decent jokes.Even though it was a disappointment still this was a touching movie and it had humour. But unlike the Simpsons episodes I guess you can just watch this one time and then it's enough.",,Anonymous,Animation

Heh,"Best movie I've seen in a while. Of course, the Simpsons will never let us down. I don't know how they do it, but every part of the movie feels original and exciting. The plot begins with Homer adopting a pig that Crusty the Clown is about to slaughter (I also have to lol at Crusty's statements, which are always golden). And as you can imagine, it just continues from there. Homer gets himself into quite the predicament, and let's just say that everybody wants a piece of him after that. There's also a lot of political humor, like how the EPA dealt with 'the problem.' Definitely one of the better movies that I've seen, up there with the Family Guy movie.

Like an extended episode from the golden years...on a much grander scale!,"The Simpsons Movie is sort of like a long episode from between the 6th and 11th seasons. It's got the same witty humor you would expect from a good Simpsons episode. It doesn't try to be stupid and random like the newer episodes.However, it does differ greatly in several ways from an episode. The flow is basically the same, but everything seems a little more serious. It tries to be smart and serious in some ways. The conflict, the dramatic turn towards the end, the resolution, the messages, and all that give it more redeeming power than a simple episode. Homer doesn't seem like a total dumbass, he seems like a caring father and a good man. He's still a dumbass, but not completely.So, all in all, The Simpsons Movie succeeds at both making you laugh out loud, and making you feel good inside.

very generously O.K,"Being an avid simpsons fan since day one and waiting many anxious years for this, I came out of the cinema on Saturday night feeling very let down by this only slightly entertaining money spinner. The cinema was ram packed with people of all ages and as I sat down in anticipation I thought I was going to be blown away with simpsons gold. I was wrong! As a simpsons fan it was O.K, and thats a generous O.K. Im not claiming to be of higher IQ than most people but whilst most of the cinema was roaring at homer falling through the roof and poking his eye with a hammer,I couldn't help but want for some of the clever risqué adult humour which the simpsons did so well in the earlier seasons(and got away with) but 98% of The jokes in it where just at best lame physical slapstick jokes aimed at under 10 year old kids. I love the simpsons and although since season 6 or 7 the writing has been below simpsons brilliant original standard I watch it every week (including re-runs) but couldn't help feeling like homer summed it up in the first 5 mins by saying 'why would people want to pay money for something they get free at home?.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation

A Disappointing Mismatch Of Infantile and Original,"It is clear from the outset that this movie is designed for a younger audience. It's excessive use of slapstick violence and an unrealistic plot is a stark contrast to the traditional, more subtle and often sarcastic humour of the original series (in the good old days).At the same time, however, innuendos creep that are perhaps not 'adult' but certainly for maturer audiences. Jokes about 'playing with yourself' and implied sex scenes (see parents' guide). Whilst these do represent the television series better, and whilst they aren't immediately obvious and would sail over the heads of a younger audience, it has to be said that it does leave me asking questions about who the intended target audience is. It seems to me that the team have just tried too hard to make the movie suit everyone.The movie itself is mildly funny, but quite frankly that isn't good enough for a COMEDY. I mentioned the plot earlier which, to recap, is too ridiculous, and I was also quite disappointed that many of the series' regulars barely featured (e.g. Apu, who I only remember having 1 or 2 lines).I guess the movie was OK. It certainly did the show justice for younger viewers, and thus gained a brand new audience for the show. It did however leave many teenagers like myself feeling rather disappointed.

For all the Simpson nerds like me, keep your eyes peeled for certain items from past episodes in the background.

I Felt Violated After Watching The Simpsons Movie.,"It isn't how i remember them or want to remember them, i had to watch some old episodes afterwards just to put myself back at ease. It was almost like the whole of Springfield had been kidnapped and replaced by strangers, and on top of that a lot of the main characters barley even got a role in the movie. I knew it was going to be bad ever since i heard about its release, it was over-hyped and under written which is a really bad combination.The most built up comedy scene was ""spiderpig"" or at least thats what everyone was talking about, i know Homer for his dry and sarcastic humour, which was rarely (if at all) seen in The Simpsons Movie. The Simpsons has always been seen as a series in which both adults and children alike can appreciate, which the movie didn't portray.

are you people crazy?,"I came on here to check on references from the movie and was shocked to see how many bad reviews this got from supposed life long fans. I have been watching ""The Simpsons"" since they were a crudely drawn cartoon sketch on ""The Tracy Ullman Show"", and I happened to love this movie!! I think people need to realize that the show has evolved with the world around them; and just because Springfield remains unchanged, does not mean that the writers should. They have always been on point with current events as well as the social/political atmosphere in our country. I refer to ""The Simpsons"" as the most honest show on television, and it has been since the day it aired. This show is America.I also often say that there are 2 kinds of people; those who love ""The Simpsons"" and those who hate them. And you can clearly tell the difference. My son started watching them at birth; it is one of the most educational cartoons out there, mixed with the kind of humor and satire I want my kid to be able to recognize.Plus, aside from Al Gore and ""An Inconvenient Truth"" this movie did more for spreading the word on saving our environment than most things I can think of.

I was not the only one, it was pretty much unanimous hilarity for the entire cinema. The animation is superb, the dialogue is as we've come to expect from the Simpsons' brains trust, and there are some extra little thrills and spills that you can tell they've been dying to lay upon us for quite some time. Personally, I felt that they pretty much nailed the ideal length for the movie. But it sets such a cracking pace that they probably could've push it out to 2 hours.

Big screen take on the TV series classic is well done.

The big screen version stays true to form with that of the TV series method of staying fresh and witty with crude and funny jokes. The writing and producing from James L. Brooks, and Matt Groening is in depth and interesting. Though the characters have remained the same as Homer is still the overweight American screwup, and Bart is just as wild as ever and the rest of the family stays with the same attitude and personality. The plot centers around the environment and the toxic spill of Springfield with the EPA hot on the heels of Homer. The Simpson family decides to relocate to Alaska with plenty of good heart warming and memorable scenes. In the end the family saves the day and returns to Springfield happily ever after.

Non-stop laughs after non-stop laughing.,"I just saw ""The Simpsons Movie"" yesterday when I went to the cinemas. No matter how bad ratings and reviews it would have had I personally would have gone and see it anyways, as I have always loved the series. I've never really been a HUGE fan, but I'm one of those people who do not change the channel if Simpsons are on. I certainly don't want to give away any spoilers on the story, so I'll just leave my usual writing of the plot out, as in this case it's pretty crucial. All I can say about the plot is that it was a surprise to me how good it actually was and it certainly won't be a disappointment to any Simpsons fan there is.Before this movie was out I heard people saying how the series had ran out of jokes and the movie can't be that good either. Well, it would be pretty obvious if the series ran out of jokes, but to me that has never been the case. I actually like the newer Simpsons more than the older ones, so I'm again one of those people. I can agree with everyone when I say that when watching this movie it felt like watching a longer episode of the series, but what made it more movie -like was the transferring to the big screen. I especially loved the animation; Though there is also 3D animation used besides the usual 2D, it still had that same heart as we all know the Simpsons of. This movie was most definitely one of the best ""episodes"" I've seen from the Simpsons. I guess the makers had lots of pressure on making a movie after the series had been on TV for 18 years and that is natural, but the way they have done it deserves an enormous appreciation as despite the pressure the makers have made a very successful from TV to a movie -translation. Probably the best we've ever seen.The humor. Oh my, the humor. I'm being as honest as I can when I say that I haven't laughed that hard in ages, as the movie is throughout non-stop laughing and it is one of the funniest movies I have ever seen. Actually, there were only like 2 - 4 parts in the movie where there was a 30 second - 1 minute period of some drama where you didn't laugh, and that is so little time that you just can't complain. I myself found those parts entertaining as well and they were also surprisingly serious which caused moments that made you relate to the Simpsons, just like any other family. Anyway, despite those moments it was indeed non-stop laughing. Unluckily, I just felt that I was sitting in the wrong audience as I felt like laughing at parts where no-one else was laughing. I can see no other reason than the rest of the audience ""not getting"" the jokes, as there were also so much jokes only the Americans find funny. Or if you are a person who know about the current situation in the USA you'll be finding those jokes funny as well. There were also so much jokes, or more like hints I'd say, about the American politics nowadays which I found hilarious but the rest of the audience just didn't laugh and that to me was a disappointment. I didn't let it affect me so I continued to watch the movie without caring what the rest of the audience was laughing at or not.Getting back to the story I found it very entertaining. It was actually a little bit different than the episodes of the series, as there was a real message in it and I also found it heart warming in a way that I've never seen the Simpsons before. Comedies like these are really hard to make, as when having so much humor throughout it usually tends to get a bit repetitive and boring. The Simpsons had one advance on their side and that was the fan base that had been growing for 18 years. But that doesn't make the movie an easy thing to do though, as that also increases the pressure on the makers's shoulders. What I mean by the fan base is that people have got known the Simpsons over the years and the movie wouldn't probably be even that funny without the series, obviously. For example every time Homer was on screen you just sensed the atmosphere it caused in the audience and people were stand-by for laughing, just because it was Homer Simpson. The humor doesn't get repetitive or boring at any part, which is a real achievement, as how many movies are there where you can honestly laugh from the beginning till the end? Yeah, not so many.""The Simpsons Movie"" does the impossible; By being a movie made from series it just doesn't disappoint you. Or at least I can't imagine it to be a disappointment to anyone. How many times you can honestly say that? Yeah, again, not so many. I don't care if I felt like watching a long episode of The Simpsons, as when laughing that hard throughout you can't really complain. It was an absolutely hilarious film, it makes history in the history of the comedy genre and it is a definite recommendation for every Simpsons fan there is. You don't see me giving 10's so much, but in this case I honestly have no other option. The movie is indeed as excellent and perfect as a comedy can pretty much get. Thanks for The Simpsons and thanks for the makers.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Bravo to the Simpsons.  This was a hilariously brilliant movie!,"The Simpsons is without a doubt my favorite television show, and because of this, the movie obviously had to be perfect...and it was pretty darn close. It seems having 11 writers from the show helped. All the jokes used were the best jokes, and they were mostly new ones, not seen on the show. I was laughing through the entire movie because of this. The direction, by longtime Simpsons director David Silverman looks better than ever, and made the movie even better to watch. The emotion that many fans have said is missing from recent episodes was quite plentiful here, making it not just an 80 minute long joke, but it layered the film, making it a movie and not just an average Simpsons episode. Though the plot itself is pretty thin, it's still obviously there. The movie deals with Springfield deciding to clean up Lake Springfield because of Lisa, and Homer dumps a silo of pig excrement into the lake, causing the Environmental Protection Agency to go nuts and lock Springfield in a dome. Once head of the EPA Russ Cargill (Voiced by A. Brooks) decides to blow up Springfield, it's up to the Simpsons to save the day, and Homer to grow up. A gripe I've heard by many people, is the movie didn't have enough of the side characters. Where it is true that the Simpsons were in much more of the film than any other characters, most of the other characters had many funny lines, like Moe, Chief Wiggum, Milhouse, Nelson, Lenny and Carl, Barney, Flanders, Reverend Lovejoy, Grampa and dozens of more classic characters. So, in the end, in no way was this movie a disappointment, and this is coming from a huge fan of the early Simpsons, who has remained a fan over the years.

Enjoyable movie undercut by its source material's greatness.,"The Simpsons have no doubt been a longtime American icon dominating the world stage of pop-culture ever since they came into being in 1987 thanks to the Tracey Ullman Show. The show's had MANY great episodes throughout its 90s run, it's had some hits but notable misses in the 00s, and the show's still a thing in the 10s. And then you have the movie: a culmination of years and years of small-screen storytelling and it's just okay. It's amusing and harmless, but it's not really anything else.I love these characters and this town: so why does the movie fall short of that legacy? It's something to do with the lackluster script, the generic 'save the world' scenario it's trying to parody (ultimately succumbing to the problem it's mocking) yet it's still watchable. It's no classic but it's still okay for all age groups to put on and watch, even if it's just noise in the background.The Simpsons Movie: it's a movie that's trying to surpass other movies while not trying to truly makes its own cinematic impressions. 3/5 stars.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
What Is Everyone's Problem With This?,"The Simpsons Movie seems to have fallen on damning criticism from all angles. Personally, I don't understand the problem; this is fresh, well written Simpsons on top form. Anyone who was expecting anything radically different from the TV show were bound to be disappointed - this is a film that needs to be taken for what it is - an hour and a half long Simpsons episode, with tightly packed, top standard Simpsons humour. As for the scale of the movie; it is much greater than the average episode; it is clear the creators have pushed the movie to the limits and tried to explore how to make it seem grander than the TV show. In a way, I think this movie is cursed by it's own popularity as a TV show, and therefore some of the jokes and story lines are bound to seem ""old hat"". But if it is taken as a standalone comedy, it is a more than worthy addition to a beloved show, and hugely enjoyable in it's own right. Roll on, sequel!",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Disappointment,"It's been quite noticeable that the Simpson's has been on a downward spiral since around the tenth season, first of all it's clear that every single possible scenario has been played out and overdone, the animation has become computerised and boring and their is a clear desperation as every celebrity with ant interest in the Simpson's are pulled in to boost ratings. Now imagine all of this and stretch one of those stories over three episodes and you get The Simpsons Movie.The first difference between the original Simpson's and the 'Movie' Simpsons is that the original was set firmly on taking realistic observations and exaggerating them (for example take Itchy and Scratchy), this is what made it such a classic because it was unlike any other cartoon. However The Simpsons Movie is based on very little and overly exaggerated. This makes the movie seem like a bad copy of itself.The second criticism of The Simpsons Movie is that The Simpsons were always the big characters and the contributors to the comedy, but it was the small characters that gave The Simpsons that variation. Therefore giving these characters minimal screen time limits the film to only one story line, when the film would have been much more interesting if the events were presented from the point of view of some of the minor characters.However the Simpsons Movie as a separate piece of work to anything else is actually moderately funny.In fact in bursts it shows some of the creative flare of the original 10 series. However as a complete film it is just a disappointment and should have been so much better.",4.0,Anonymous,Animation
A successful move to cinemas,"TV's longest running sitcom family makes it to the big screen . . . or Homer Simpson screws everything up for Springfield.Either one is a good way to sum up ""The Simpsons Movie"", a wholly enjoyable flick that maintains the show's sense of humor. And that's really all that was needed, throw in a few guest stars and some choice one-liners from the various local color, and you've got a movie. In that sense, the story doesn't even really start until the 45-minute mark, with so many side characters being given screen time. Which isn't a bad thing because it's consistently funny. That goes for the whole movie; it's got wit, heart and plenty of Homer's nonsense.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Worth seeing in the theater! (at least once),"As a long time Simpsons fan, I fully expected to enjoy this film. I did. Face it, I've EASILY watched 4 Simpsons episodes back to back and that's LONGER than this Movie.Before going I wondered if the film version would bring anything extra to watching the Simpsons, it does. Many times there were huge complicated and detailed shots that really made seeing it in the theater very enjoyable. The film might look as exciting on a large HD TV, but it certainly blows the doors off watching the Simpsons on a standard set.And seeing it in a theater brought a new Simpsons experience for me, a live audience 'laugh track'. I suddenly was aware of how much the audience was enjoying the film as their laughter filled the theater.As for the story, in classic Simpsons form it threads a huge number of gags together that lead to the primary driving force of the story. There's no need to be specific about the story as it's the Simpsons, anything goes. There is a brief segment after the Simpsons leave Springfield that's about 10 minutes long where the film lags, or at least I wasn't laughing (but was still entertained). Interestingly enough a majority of the children in the audience found it funny. After that it's fast paced classic Simpsons action leading up to the explosive ending.About the only real disappointment I had was that they didn't do a huge musical number. Maybe they'll have one in the sequel (there is a tease for it at the end).BTW  Stay for the credits, they fill them with a few things here and there to make them worth sitting through. In fact when the credits started the people sitting in front of us stood up to leave but then stopped (and blocked our view) when they realized they were going to miss more of the film. I think it's the first time I've ever had to ask someone to sit down in a movie theater.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Surprisingly plot driven, unsurprisingly, very funny...","Eighteen years after The Tracy Ullman Show the longtime creators of The Simpson's cannot be expected to create an hour and a half of brilliance when they've only tried this plot in 22 minute slots. The film reads much like the plot of every Simpson's episode you've ever seen (saying 'I've never seen an episode right now would be un-American). Homer does something that creates a problem, it tests his family's love for him, he does something ever dumber to prove his love and everyone learns something. This time Homer dumps his pig feces silo into the lake and creates major problems for Springfield. The plot, surprisingly, holds out for the duration of the film, it's nothing special, but it doesn't fail like most adult- cartoon films (See Family Guy: The Stewie Griffin Story or Aqua Teen Hunger Force Colon Movie Film for Theaters). Best of all the film remains consistently funny. The first half hour is a non-stop barrage of jokes (including possibly the greatest Simpson's song ever, ""Spider- Pig), after that the jokes thin in an attempt to keep the plot from treading water. But it holds up. In typical Simpson's fashion there are a few guest stars in the film, but they keep it to a minimum so they film doesn't begin to feel more like a reminiscence of the last eighteen seasons. It's more or less a lengthy episode; they don't even really abuse their ability to do things that they are unable to on TV. A little bit of enhanced animation, a 'god-damn,' a middle finger and Bart's penis sufficed. It is easily the best of the new adult-cartoon features that are appearing. And it's good enough to keep the audience excited over the prospect of a sequel, which is all but promised during the closing credits of the film.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Well worth seeing,"I went to see this movie with a buddy of mine on the second day at Cineplex in Maple Ridge using my free movie ticket I got from iCoke.ca. I have to say that if you like the typical Simpsons humor, you definitely won't be disappointed in this movie. The jokes in this movie are actually funny without being stupid or overused like most typical comedies do these days.You will probably recognize a lot of the characters from the series in this movie.I'd definitely recommend seeing this movie to anyone, unless they are my enemies :p",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
An Honest Review From A Fan,"I've been a long-time Simpsons fan, but I agree that this movie was a poor effort on their part. I do indeed agree with most of the negative reviews, but most of the people who flame this movie aren't really that honest about it and don't give enough insight to really say what made this movie bad. So here we go, a much more honest review from a long-time Simpsons fan: The storyline was really generic and like others say, it does seem like propaganda, but that's not why I didn't really like this movie all that much. Animations were indeed spectacular, but I'll be lying if I said they weren't trying too hard to impress audience members, because let's not forget, a majority of today's typical viewers care more about animations than quality, which I find sad. As for humour, this is the most important category, in my opinion. It was there, I did laugh a few times, but it was really lacking and I really felt it was trying too hard. Worst thing was that Homer was basically unlikable throughout the entire thing when he's usually a pretty lovable guy from time-to-time.Overall, this movie was really average in my eyes. It had potential and just barely passed. If you're a Simpsons fan boy who thinks all Simpsons stuff HAS to be awesome and the best ever, you're fooling yourself, but who am I to say you can't enjoy it? If you do, go ahead. If you're a hater who never liked Simpsons in the first place, then just don't bother commenting on, let alone watching, this movie in the first place.That is all.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Very funny, back to the Basics...","When I started to watch the Simpsons in 1990, I saluted this series by its exaggerated caricature of the North American Society. Luckily, the series touched so much the heart of French Canadians we did a special dubbing here adapted to Quebecquers.However, these past few years, even with the excellent dubbing, most episodes fell flat and I miss the first seasons which were real classics (sort of what happened to the Flintstones before their children and the Great Gazoo arrived, a thing I forgave to Hanna-Barbera since because the original series was great cartoon) This time, Matt Groening and his team thought it over, put some new perspective and voilà ! The movie is well told, very funny moments, some clever wisecracks, and Homer Simpson trying to be a hero here after his downfall (and almost hung by a lynch mob).I won't tell more. I haven't seen the English version, but I believe the cast is again on the top of things, especially that I praise the work of Harry Shearer, who takes so many voices here...Here in Quebec, we feared that a version from France would have spoiled our fun (no offense to French fans, they do deserve a version of their own) but it is the same cast and crew of the French Canadian version we hear here and they do a wonderful job (I still remember Hubert Gagnon learning us French on TV in the 70s, dressed as a super-hero-like extra-terrestrial, and veteran actress Beatrice Picard doing great sitcoms on the TVA Network in the 60-80s)...Go have some laughs in 90 minutes, you'll have your Simpson faith restored in you...",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
The last breath before the end of The Simpsons? It should have been.,"SO I watched this film the other day thinking it was the first I watched it, I was wrong. I must have watched it when it first came out but in the grand scheme of things the film is slightly unremarkable as well as forgettable, frankly because the original run of the Simpson is so awesome. But the Simpsons television show started su#king at least 4 years before this film came out so whatever, I guess we should be thankful. The makers of the Simpsons must have seen the writing on the wall and made this film before the Simpsons would be cancelled. The strange thing is the Simpson still hasn't been cancelled and literally no nobody still watches it. This review is coming off to negative. Basically the film is a good one after the slightly painfully boring first 15 minutes of it. Final score: 7 out of 10",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Good, But Nothing Special","For as long as I could remember, everyone, everywhere were talking about a Simpsons movie. When will it be made? Is there going to be one? Finally, the creators took the chance and created arguably the most well-known TV family and turned it into a motion picture. The Simpsons movie wasn't nothing special, the show itself went past it prime years and years ago, now, their newest episodes are rather ordinary. The Simpsons Movie just surpassed that, it was a good movie but had that new Simpson feel, that feel that 'we' fans can't relate to, and not find it funny nor enjoyable. But the Simpsons Movie passed through it, they had all their characters, an easy plot and turned it into a 90 minute movie. The fans have finally got what they wanted, now back to the episodes!",,Anonymous,Animation
C Minus,"It's been awhile since I've seen The Simpsons Movie, like 5 years. No doubt, The Simpsons was a great show growing up, that I can't believe is still running for 25 years. The Simpsons used to be my favorite TV show 15 years ago, I don't watch it too often now and I have some of the Halloween episodes on DVD which I got from the Supermarket. However, it seems like almost everybody prefers the older episodes, pre-2000. It just seems like the newer episodes don't have as much appeal as the older episodes. I remember watching a Simpsons YouTube video in it with Justin Bieber from an episode and I saw how the top comment said, ""R.I.P. The Simpsons 1989-1998."" Yeah, those were the good old episodes, even if you watch the TV show on TV nowadays they don't often times show those episodes on TV anymore. If they did start showing the older episodes on Fox, I'm sure The Simpsons would have more viewers than they do now, so I think Fox should start showing the older episode reruns. We can ask what makes this movie not as good as it could be. Well, they try to be funny as obviously the newer Simpsons episodes try to be funny. But, while the movie might have some funny scenes, it seems like the movie mostly tried to be funny and tried to show slapstick humor that a lot of us probably didn't think was too funny. It seems like the most memorable scene from this movie was when Bart Simpson was skateboarding naked. I felt bad for Bart after that scene seeing his sad face. What made this movie not too good, well there didn't seem to be much characterization in this movie. We didn't seem to see as much of the regular characters as we see on the show. They had brief scenes, but nothing much about them. In the show and especially older episodes they had humor as we got to know basically all the characters in Springfield from a single episode about them. It seems like the whole plot in the movie was how Springfield was covered in a dome because of pollution, and the people in the community tried to get out of the dome and protect their own city from the government, making the government and Arnold Schwarzenegger look like bad guys and you kind of feel bad for the people of Springfield and Homer Simpson even if it was meant for comical purposes rather than serious purposes. What was really good about this movie. Well, I've seen TV shows made into movies and often times the movies don't make it look like an episode from the TV show. Instead, they add things that are quite different from the TV show. An example I'm thinking of is The Mighty Morphin Power Rangers Movie. I remember how while they did use the same characters and tried to have the same kind of plot they had on the TV show for a movie, it was too different from the TV show and seemed to lose it's appeal that way and didn't follow the TV show as much as the Power Ranger World Tour Show did so the World Tour Show was better. So, enough about Power Rangers. The Simpsons Movie looks like it's an episode rather then it's own independent movie. We see the same characters and the characters act the way they do on the show. We see similar scenes and types of humor from the movie as we do on the show. We also see things like a message across the screen as we do on the show making it look like you're watching The Simpsons on Fox. So yeah, it's great that it stays along with the show, not just changing the themes around. However, it could have been better written as I heard that this movie was rewritten so many different times. I don't know what plot could have made it better, but probably one where it's more about the characters and less about what's happening in Springfield. Overall, I'd give this film a 7/10. In school often times 70-79 would be a C. I'd have to give it a 70 where it still passes, but barely. I almost gave it a 6/10, but I think it's fair to give this movie a 7/10, but still a C-.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

To all Simpson fans  !! it was worth the wait!!,"I must say the movie was like the best chapters, jokes and all the best Simpsons identity and history compilation. They came out with the classic for the big screen, they were as always 100% spontaneous, 100% sarcastic, their critics and discord with everything around the world were just spectacular. Before the movie release there were some moments while discussing with other fans on forums and other stuff where I thought the movie was going to disappoint but hey!! what I was thinking??? lol, immediately I calmed myself knowing that it was created by the same genius that have been filling our lives with simpsonmania all these years, I thank God for their existence. I know each simpson's character has its own fans club but it wouldn't have been possible to give each one a long appearance time in a coherent way, it would have turned the movie slow and without sense, Just know you watched the best simpsons episode of all times!!!!. I believe the most important characters had their moment:Moe, Mr Burns, Krusty, Flanders, Comic book guy, Skinner, etc. you see, I can't list all of them because now I notice that they all had their moment, obviously I will always wonder why the absence of Sideshow bob, maybe in the sequel.Finally: Simpsons fans, you can't lose this movie, it is really a masterpiece, it is the best gift, the reward to all those who never lose a chapter, to all those who constantly talk about the simpsons on every funny conversation, to all those who have adopted simpsons modes and ways, to all those who love them as I do.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

Just like the early episodes, where one second he's speaking, the next they pan above the eyes, and Homer has a conversation with his brain. 3) Moleman didn't get trapped in a bad situation The boob lady didn't belong in the movie at all, neither did the other new character",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

"""The Simpsons Movie"" - An event 20 years in the making","For those accustomed to watching it on the small screen every weekday night, ""The Simpsons Movie"" is a long time coming, a motion picture event that's 20 years in the making. I've been watching ""The Simpsons"" ever since I was a kid growing up during the early 1990s, and I myself have waited for something of this magnitude. The creation of series originator Matt Groening, people who have seen the 400+ episodes of ""The Simpsons"" know that a movie has been on the table for over a decade, but nothing has ever manifested itself. So, fans just had to revel in one episode after the other, knowing, that one day, their dream of a ""Simpsons Movie"" would become a reality. And now here we are, 20 years after the cartoon first appeared as a short on ""The Tracey Ullman Show"" way back in 1987. Groening definitely had a hand in this production, otherwise ""The Simpsons Movie"" would have sucked big time. Unlike other theatrical adaptations of a television work, nothing has really changed, except that there's a bigger budget, better animation, but the characters are all the same. That makes for great animated cinematic entertainment. It's just nice to finally see a creator in control of his creation for once. Director David Silverman's ""The Simpsons Movie"" finds America's favorite dysfunctional family the target of a lynch mob after Homer buys a pig, and he disposes of its waste in Springfield Lake, turning the already-heavily polluted lake into a toxic cesspool that causes multiple eyes to sprout on any wildlife that comes into contact with it. To make long stories short, the EPA comes in and seals off Springfield with a massive dome. When it's discovered that Homer is responsible for the Lake Springfield toxic cesspool, he, Marge, Bart, Lisa, and Maggie are forced to go on the run to Alaska and start over (don't ask how they get out, just watch the movie). EPA man Cargill (voice of Albert Brooks) manages to fool President Schwarzenegger into launching an operation to nuke Springfield so that it becomes a tourist attraction similar to the Grand Canyon, since nothing will be left except for a smoking hole in the ground (actor Tom Hanks does an infomercial on the subject). Marge eventually discovers this and decides to head back to their hometown, sans Homer. Eventually, Homer gets the guts to return as well and save Springfield with his family. I literally could not stop laughing at ""The Simpsons Movie."" It gets you from the opening scenes (complete with a performance by Green Day) to the time the credits begin to roll. You'll be laughing so hard that you'll be barely able to catch your breath. I know I was laughing so hard that after a while I became tired and it got so that when something funny happened (and those comedic moments come at you left and right), it was strenuous to do so. That's an effect of a truly unique film experience. All of our favorite characters are here, some get more screen time than others (the film's only real weak point), but if that makes you mad, just watch the television show but still, don't hold that against the movie. I could tell that ""The Simpsons Movie"" definitely satisfied the cravings of my fellow cinema-goers, since their response to the movie was overwhelmingly positive. ""The Simpsons Movie"" is a simple culmination of 20 years worth of entertainment in 87 minutes. A cultural phenomenon has finally reached its peak and its core fans were overwhelmingly satisfied with a film experience they're not likely to ever forget.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

Prepare for Disappointment Unless You Like Seasons 10-18,"For those of you who have hated the last several seasons of The Simpsons but were hoping that this film would be great due to the pedigree of talent that is found in its credits, I am sad to inform you that this film will disappoint you. To be fair, compared to the rubbish they have fed us in the last 8 seasons, the film was somewhat watchable. A few jokes in the beginning are very funny, and overall the opening to the film is solid. However, at the point of Homer meeting his beloved Spider Pig (which everyone in the theater loved except for me), the film transitions into a poorly crafted, overwrought melodrama that is mildly painful to sit through. You get a mixture of pathetic melancholy material and lackluster gags - it is awful, and I don't mean awful entertaining. The biggest problem with the film is that its creators forgot that The Simpsons is a comedy, not an animated soap opera.I've been watching the show since I was born. Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire was aired on December 17, 1989, when I was nearly a month old. So this show basically grew up with me, and I consider Seasons 3-9 of the Simpsons to be the greatest works the television industry has ever created. Even though I can't stand watching the new episodes, I was still somewhat excited and mildly optimistic about this film. It could have been worse, but that's faint praise. If you're a long-time fan disillusioned with the show as I am, I recommend just watching the first 30 minutes of the movie and then hopping to something better. You won't be missing much.

"Quirky, Overrated, But Mainly For Kids","I watched the preview to this back in July '07, and wasn't really expecting any high hopes for this film, for I had only just watched ""Stewie Griffin: The Untold Story"" the other day which is just a humorous string of episodes back to back.The whole promotion, was over-hyped, but I only wanted to see this film for 2 things.1) To at least be in the know for something at school after the summer holidays.2) To see what the whole over-hyped, over-rated promotion of this film is about.Now, I sat through, this and most of the visual gags are for children and are quite funny. A few witty adult quotes, were what caught my eye. I really hoped this was going to be a BBFC Certificate ""12"" as apposed to a ""PG"", because I thought with films etc. like Family Guy you can just about get away with nearly everything.But it feels like the whole tone of everything has gone 2 steps back, seeing how the Seasons are now upped to BBFC Certificate 12s as well.But still, this is mainly a film for the youth, a few quirks will keep the parents from being bored.

"The funniest film in years. Yes, it's THAT good.","It was a day of laughs that started as I patiently waited in line at the concession stand on a hot Monday afternoon ready to watch ""The Simpsons Movie."" The obese woman standing in front of me dropped her two Value Pepsi drinks on the floor and it got all over her, and the guy behind the snack bar said dully ""Thanks for putting this much more excitement into my life"" and called for a mop. Because this is exactly something that would happen to me normally, I couldn't help laughing until I took my seat in the theater. Little did I know I was in luck for more.Seriously, I don't remember the last time I laughed so hard in my life. I have been a die-hard, hardcore, extremely loyal Simpsons fan for most of my life, and there has been nearly no better treat this summer to me than watching America's ""first family of comedy"" on the big screen. If you're like me, you've probably noticed the last few seasons (ok, more than few, more like eight seasons) of the Simpsons have been less funny, less charming, less witty, etc. Usually whenever someone mentions a good episode of the Simpsons, it's been one of the old episodes from the early 90s. Let me one of many to tell you straight and upfront: the comedy is back. Paired up with hysterical references to the real world, classic spoofs on FOX itself (like the show is famous for), HUGE celebrity cameos (including a very popular rock band that tragically drowns in a river) even making fun of movie theaters and watching a TV show adaptation on the big screen, and even some tear-shedding tragedy--The Simpsons Movie has it all. The answer is finally true to me, and it will be to you after seeing the movie: the reason the recent seasons have been disappointing is because Matt Groening and his team of absolute GENIUSES have been bottling up a storm of side-splitting, spleen-bursting, voice-loosing, eye-tearing, stomach-bleeding, popcorn-crunching gold that would, to our surprise, be unleashed on July 27th, 2007, like a tank of Mentos in an ocean of Diet Coke.

"Fresh, Ambitious & Really Funny, The Simpsons Score On The Big Screen","Homer dumps some 'waste' into a nearby lake in Springfield, causing the EPA to take dramatic matters. The decision is made to enclose the city in a dome, thus making Homer public enemy number one.From 180ft paintings in the grass next to sacred images, to 7/11 turning itself into a Kwik-E-Marts and numerous TV spots on the fox network, it was no surprise that almost everyone on earth knew there about The Simpsons Movie. The longest running show on television, 18 years later is finally hitting the big screen. To say it was hyped would be an understatement. Can a show that has been falling down the ladder in quality and viewers make the jump to the big screen? Well, with 11 writers, all from the good days of The Simpsons, it's safe to say that they hit this one out of the park.While they tried their best to keep the plot of the film under wraps before its release, the basic plot of the film was known to be before I saw the film. It did ruin a few surprises and jokes, but not the overall experience. Like Homer says in the opening bit of the film, why pay for something when you can see it for free on the television. Well, this movie is the answer to that. It pushes the envelope further, which is a luxury the creators have in the film world that they do not have in TV land. Where shows like Family guy appeared on TV and garnered big success, it seemed The Simpsons was losing a battle it was always winning. Now after it's big screen debut, The Simpsons, I'm hoping, is back on track to being the show it once was. What Family Guy failed to do with it's ""film"", which felt like 3 episodes edited together, The Simpsons does wonderfully.The animation is crisp and up-to-date. Seeing this film did not make me miss the flowing hair on certain chef rats or big green ogres. While we have seen Homer in ""3-D"" it simply would not have worked here and I'm glad they stuck with the traditional animation.For fans of the show, it's always fun finding those inside jokes scattered throughout the film, such as Homer finally making the jump over the gorge, a feat he failed to do in 'Bart The Daredevil' and the ambulance that is still crashed at the edge of the gorge. Aside from show references, there are hundreds upon hundreds of film references, which include: Titanic, Star Wars, Spider-man, An Inconvenient Truth and many, many more.The film is definitely for all ages, both adults and kids, who are fans of the show, will find this film entertaining. While in the theatre the laughter was unison with young and old. The good thing is, you don't really have to be a fan of the show to get the jokes. There is enough comedy in this film for both parties. It does help if you know the history of some of the characters, such as Millhouse's lust for Lisa, and the cold heart of Mr. Burns. There are also some new characters introduced, whether or not we see them recurring in the show is another story.The voice acting is on the spot here, which is what would be expected from the people who've been these characters for almost two decades. As with many episodes, there are celebrity guest voices, but I can't really say who lends their voice without giving away the joke/surprise that it's meant to be.Yes, this does feel like a Simpsons episode stretch to 90 minutes, but that is a good thing. Crafting a film from a series that has been on the air for nearly two decades is a risky thing, but they pulled it off. The film is oozing of the first few seasons of the show, which are the best, but it's also fresh and ambitious. Those 11 writers for the show, show us that they care about these characters and prove to us that they are still in good hands. Will the success of the film, spread back to the show? I hope so. And to answer Homer's question. Why pay for something when you can get it for free on TV. Well, because it's funny, that's why.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
An awesome experience,"The movie was great! I've watched The Simpsons as a little kid, but I've never seen the movie before. It was awesome! In this movie you're going to see some hilarious things done by Homer and co. You can absolutely watch this with younger children and older people would also enjoy it.

Very poor,"If this was a new animated comedy from an unknown studio it might pass as decent. But it isn't, it is The Simpsons, probably the best TV programme over the past 15 years. So from those very high standards I'm afraid I have to rate it as very poor.I just didn't like this film at all, as a comedy it failed, and surely that it what a comedy film must be judged on, does it make you laugh? I'm afraid The Simpsons didn't, and therefore fails.What happened to all those other characters that make The Simpsons so good? Principle Skinner, Selma and Patti, Groundskeeper Willie, Barney, Mr Burns, Smithers, where were they all? I'm afraid this wasn't very good at all, and follows a number of disappointing blockbusters this summer.",2.0,Anonymous,Animation
Just D'oh It.,"After nearly 18 complete years running strong on FOX Sunday nights and after a mind-blowing 166 re-writes, ""The Simpsons Movie"" finally was born and the result ends up being a fitting correlation with the longest-running animated series in television history. Although far from classic fare and not quite spectacular, the movie does deliver what it promises: our heroes in an often irreverent and hilarious romp with pop-culture subtleties galore to please viewers of most all ages. Homer accidentally pollutes Springfield and the Environmental Protection Agency looks to make an example of the sleepy town by literally doming them in and correcting the problem. Thus the town's first family becomes fugitives and end up in Alaska of all places with smile-cracking outcomes. Saying the movie exceeds three outstanding episodes of the series played back-to-back would be an outright lie, but considering the source and the limited premise, ""The Simpsons Movie"" still comes out smelling better than most. 4 stars out of 5.",,Anonymous,Animation
Lighten up!!!!!!,"Alright guys, here goes. I cant believe I'm saying this, being a die hard Simpsons fan from day one, but you Simpson's fans are a bunch of whining, annoying, babies! All of you folks who complain that the show no longer measures up to it's heyday (seasons 3 through 9 in my opinion) and then go to watch the movie made from the show you were just complaining about deserve to be disappointed. ""The show is not as good as it once was"" Is anything? I have the feeling that no matter what went on in the movie some people would have found things to complain about. People complained that the plot was thin and then complained about the lack of favorite characters (Mr. Burns, Apu)who would have contributed nothing to the plot and would have only been inserted to throw out a weak one liner that these same people would then have complained about.People complained that the studio didn't use the movie medium to push social or film-making envelopes like the South Park movie did. The South Park guys were just waiting for the chance to push that envelope and doing a movie gave them that chance. The Simpsons however, have always been more about subtlety. Would it have made anyone happier if Bart had came out and dropped an F-bomb?The Simpsons have become an American institution (and yes, maybe even a brand) but in doing so they have also made a lot of people laugh, made a lot of people very happy. Matt Groening and team deserve the success that they are enjoying more so than a lot of our (celebrities). Shame on you! For you to watch the movie to the show that you say is no good and then feel you have the right to complain is wrong.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
excelsior!,"If you don't go with any expectations, like i did. and if you are anything like me, you will laugh the whole way through and leave the theater with a warm fussy feeling and a smile. great Simpsons. great comedy. Don't make the mistake i see other people making, of expecting seasons 4 through 7 rolled up into a magical ball of indescribable hilarity. Yes its true that most of the beloved characters are reduced to mere extras, and that, most likely, means your favorite ancillary character wont get the attention a TV episode would give it. I have read other people say the first thirty minutes or so where hilarious and the rest was slow. but honestly...i think they have ADD. Go. Sit back. Get comfortable. Enjoy. its not a masterpiece of the cinema, but personally, i got my money's worth.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
not great but very good,"With an extended running time of one hour and twenty-six minutes and a wide screen ration of 2:35 instead of the usual 1.33:1, ""The Simpsons Movie"" is longer and bigger than the average series episode to be surebut is it funnier? Well, not quite. That's a caveat I feel obliged to offer for those expecting this to be the laugh-riot sensation of all time. It isn't. Still, compared to most of the big screen comedies that have come our way this season, ""The Simpson Movie"" is one heck of a funny and entertaining movie - provided you don't go into it expecting more than the movie itself can reasonably deliver.The plotting, which is normally pretty freeform and surrealistic to begin with, has been ratcheted up even further in that direction for the movie. The story has Homer causing a major environmental catastrophe in the town of Springfield when he thoughtlessly dumps a massive container of pig manure in the local lake, turning it into a sludgy toxic swamp. To deal with this emerging national threat, President Schwarzenegger has a huge glass dome placed over the city, trapping the understandably irate citizenry inside. There's no point in revealing anything more about the storyline except to say that it is up to Homer to save the day, which, of course, he does, in his own inimitable way.Fans of the series will be happy to know that ""The Simpsons Movie"" effortlessly captures the manic energy, sophisticated satire and devil-may-care spirit that have been its hallmarks from the very beginning. Homer's good-natured bumbling, Marge's exasperated pragmatism, Lisa's unquenchable optimism, and, of course, Bart's fresh-faced mischievousness are all on full display in the movie (along with something else of Bart's that is very much on display as well). The other favorites who show up on screen include the perennial toddler, Maggie, Grampa Simpson, Ned Flanders, Mr. Burns, Millhouse, Krusty the Clown and others too numerous to mention.A team of well over a dozen writers - headed by series creators Matt Groening and James L. Brooks - has come up with some hilarious situations and one-liners, enough, in fact, to compensate for the very few ideas or jokes that flame out or misfire. The zinger-to-dud ratio is one of the best we've encountered in quite some time at the movies, though it's not as high, perhaps, as the best work in the series. As with most feature-length comedies, the concept does feel a little stretched at times and the humor itself runs a trifle thin. Still, with this much talent plugging away at the movie, it would be impossible for it to miss or disappoint its fans in any major way. And, of course, there's the instantly familiar and outstanding voice work from regulars Dan Castellaneta, Julie Kavner, Nancy Cartwright, Yeardley Smith, Harry Shearer and Hank Azaria to get us into the spirit of the enterprise.The animators have chosen not to tamper too much with the look of the film for its big screen presentation. There may be a bit more elaborate movement in some of the shots, but, for the most part, this is the same uncluttered, two-dimensional Simpsonian world familiar to us from the series.Indeed, the defining philosophy of those who made the film seems to be ""Why mess with a sure thing?"", an approach that can be both a strength and a weakness depending on how one looks at it. For unlike the ""South Park"" movie, which used its jump to the big screen to expand the scope of its vision and carry the series to a new level, ""The Simpsons Movie"" feels more like an extended version of a single episode, simply blown up to a more impressive size and length. Thus, those looking for this to be the best and greatest ""Simpson"" episode ever may find themselves disappointed with what they find here. Ditto for those who expect it to provide something different from what they've already seen on TV. However, those who just want a few good laughs at the expense of everyone's favorite lovably dysfunctional adult and his wise guy progeny will have a rollicking good time at the movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
They made the perfect movie,"I was predisposed to love ""The Simpsons,"" as I have loved The Simpsons since it came on the air. As a Gen-Xer, I'm of the right generation -- this is OUR series.But I remember reading an interview a few years back where Matt Groening said they didn't want to make a movie if it would end up being like three TV episodes strung together. If they were going to make a movie, it had to be like one, big, gigantic, super-sized extra-delicious episode.And that's what they pulled off. Everything you love about ""The Simpsons"" is here and precisely done, from seemingly-THC-induced tangents to irreverent one-liners to bizarre plot twists to low-key political digs. It's written in the same incredibly tight way that, when you're watching TV episodes, leaves you wondering how they packed so much story into one eight-minute segment.They did it! It's perfect! Go see it! (But don't see it too many times, because Fox sucks and you shouldn't give them a lot of money.) Viva La Simpsons!",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Well done comic comedy, but not SIMPSONS enough","The Simpsons Movie starts on a high level of humor A HIGH LEVEL. And even much meaner and more grown up than we're used from the telly. You get such nice jokes at the beginning that your firing of all your powder in the first 15 minutes or so. My favorite is a visual joke involving Bart going downtown with his skateboard.BUT sadly the quality and level of humor is on a constant down slide to average series level of the new seasons (which i really REALLY do NOT like) to the end ... You could mark a very high point at the beginning and a pretty low one at the end and draw a line between them and you get the quality ""curve"" of the movie.Overall the movie was not bad and till the end there are small moments of VERY NICE to PERFECT jokes that keep it watchable ... but the simpsons on the Big Screen should have been more like this.If you are a hardcore Simpsons-Fan go watch it NOW. If not: Wait for the DVD release, that would be sufficient.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
The Movie We've Been Waiting For So Long,"After years and years of rumors surrounding the unattainable Simpsons Movie, it has finally come. Was all the wait worth it? Yes. Yes it was.The movie begins with the drum rolls of the 20th century company...before Ralph Wiggum walks out and sings with the drum rolls. You know this movie won't be like anything you've ever seen.The movie moves along like a well oiled machine with every piece of the story being laid out very well. It is not like some of the Simpsons episodes where the beginning has NOTHING to do with the upcoming plot. In the light of environmental issues, the story revolved around the fact that pollution is destroying our world, and even Springfield (wherever it is) is in danger.Now, we all know we will not go to this movie for the plot. After being introduced in 1987 on the Tracey Ullman Show, the Simpsons family has been through almost every imaginable situation (maybe Marge will become a robot in one episode). That being said, the plot is still a well plaid out one. There are not many moments where enjoyment is hindered by the lack of plot explanation.The great minds behind the Simpsons deliver, and they deliver their very best. There were laughs throughout the whole auditorium every few minutes, if not every few seconds. My mouth was hurting from the smiling by the time I left the theater. There is a jab at fox, the ridiculous jokes where we cannot help but laugh at, and there is of course the playing with the audience's expectations (for example, the censorship that we have become accustomed to on the show is relieved and we forget this sometimes, and the writers take advantage of this to surprise us and make us laugh.) We came to love this humor and it is all there.The tangible plot and hilarious jokes are included, and most people expect just those two things, if not only the jokes. But if you listen to the commentary on the Simpsons DVDs, you will know that the old time, and arguably best Simpsons writers love putting heart into their episodes. Do not fear, there is enough heart to go around.It is an animated movie, so I will touch on that aspect. The animation is superb. It doesn't look like the old days, nor are the colors as warm and rich like in the aged seasons. But the extensive computer animation works in the favor of the movie; there are some fantastic sequences that will amaze you. In recent episodes, the clean cut and computer-aided animation seem to distract people (or, at least that is true for me). But this movie's jokes are so funny and top notch that the animation did not distract; it only enhances the film, like it should.Going into this movie as, let's say, a die hard Family Guy fan, the whacky comedy of the Simpsons may not sit well with you. But if you love and embrace the old seasons of the Simpsons, that golden age that the fans embrace with both arms, this movie delivers with excellence. Homer doesn't play the saxamaphone, there is no monorail, and Ralph never does go to Bovine University. But what we are left with is the longest episode of the Simpsons ever, not that that is a bad thing; it is indeed also the funniest episode.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

8.8!!!! Are you serious????,"I felt like I got punched in the heart after watching this movie. Throughout the film I was led on to believe that I was watching a classic (seasons 1-9) extended Simpsons episode. But then, as the story progressed, I realized that I was indeed duped by the easy outs the writers on this show have taken as of late. Rehashed episodes (Cape Feare, Bart's Comet) and rehashed scenes (the Carpenters from The Way We Were) Will make any die-hard fan want to puke in their mouth.Shame on all of you who have been giving this film great marks. Over the past decade, Matt Groening has taken one of the funniest shows ever and turned it into a corporate cash cow. Were people's expectations for this film really this low that it could receive an 8.8 after 9000 votes!? I can go on about the film's shortcomings. The lack of allusive humor (a foundation for the Simpsons) was abominable. Burns, Apu, Principal Skinner were all in the movie for less than a minute combined.I dare IMDb to post this review first.",2.0,Anonymous,Animation
Yellow Jell-O,"I saw the Simpsons Movie on DVD three days ago, and already I couldn't tell you the plot -- it had something to do with a gigantic glass dome over Springfield, or other. It was an entertaining roller-coaster ride of an episode and in wide screen and longer and yellower, but overall the quality of the plot and the gags was below that of one of the better TV episodes. I had the impression that the makers couldn't wait to get their hands on their profits, and that consequently not a lot of love an dilligence went into the production.Overall, the movie was entertaining but also a bit of a let-down, especially after the brilliant 3D-bunny-rabbit commercial. You will get better mileage out of watching a few classic episodes.",,Anonymous,Animation
It's Big! It's Funny! It's The Simpsons Movie!,"When Homer mistakenly pollutes the river with toxic waste from his ""Pig Crap"" silo, he causes the EPA to encase Springfield in a glass dome, and must save them before President Schwarzenegger gives the order for the town to be destroyed.Although I'm not a huge fan of the television show, I'm a fan. ""The Simpsons"" is arguably one of the best television shows ever created. Even the new seasons can bring some chuckles. Now I must say, if you don't know anything about The Simpsons, then the movie won't be as effective if you were a fan. I can say that fans will be really pleased and satisfied.This movie will make you laugh-out-loud and chuckle. Sure, this movie isn't going to win any Oscars but the film is really entertaining and that's the only thing that matters. The plot isn't that great but who cares? It's about the jokes in here. We don't care about the plot. Even Bart shows some nudity and some other jokes in the film are surprisingly vulgar, which makes me say that it's not always kid-friendly.Every character has a moment to shine. How could they fit every character (or most character) in the mere 80 minutes? I don't know but they did it. I also liked the cameos and spoofs in the film. Although there are many jokes in the film, there are some quiet and sad scenes, which, surprisingly, are really lovely.If you want an entertaining film, here you go. If you want a film with a great story and has this moral in the end, stay away. It's not trying to be cutesy and just for the kids to enjoy. There is some adult humor and everyone will laugh and have the time of their lives. It's worth your money. Trust me.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
A nice transition to the big screen.,"A pretty good film, the jokes fly in fast and it's working hard to try and entertain you. Balancing all the characters into one film was always going to be an impossible job but they tried hard. The story is set up well, though it does take the slightly strange step of over half the film taking place outside of Springfield. Poor parenting and Homer's challenge to reconcile his love for his family with his thoughtless and self obsessed side are the main thread of the film. Homer has to prove through his bravery that he can redeem himself and change everyone's view of him. The soundtrack is more movie like than most Simpson episodes and the camera work is more fluid and less static when it comes to the animation, the camera seems to glide around much more in this, as though it were a tracking shot. Lisa gets a bit to do, Bart is Bart, modelled after his father somewhat. I probably liked the first hour the most, but wasn't so interested in the Alaska story.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Everyone go see this film!!!  it really is great!!! true simpsons fans will love this movie!!!,"before watching this movie i was as skeptical as most people about the quality of this movie. every detail i had heard about the movie made it inevitable that it was going to be bad, and it was not going to be comparable to the show. i had heard the run time was going to be short, they had re-written a lot of it because test audiences had not liked it, and it is released at a time when the new Simpson's episodes were not that great. i went into the theater expecting the worst. this movie surpassed my expectations in every way. it reminded me why i had fallen in love with the Simpson's, and how extremely funny these characters are. it had the classic Simpson's style humor with every joke having multiple layers, it had political commentary, it had a great plot, it referred to itself in a way that only true Simpson's fans would get, it had everything i wanted. i strongly suggest watching this in a theater with a packed audience. DO NOT WAIT TO WATCH THIS ON DVD! see it in the theaters where you can feel like a large family coming together to share laughter and love for a cartoon family that has been around since most of us can remember. to quote my friend after watching the movie,""they did it."" and i completely agree.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

Essentially the best animated movie of all time.,"Walking into the theatre after waiting so long this movie filled me with excitement. The Simpson's movie did not let me down.

The Movie continued its trend of guest appearances in the movie featuring Tom Hanks and Greenday. The 18 year wait paid off with more than I had anticipated.The only flaw is that it left me wanting more only lasting an hour and a half.

Simpsons: The movie. Is it better than the series?,"I haven't seen much of the Simpsons. Just an episode or a two. And when the movie released first, I thought I would at last experience the characters of one of the greatest animated toons in history on big screen. Yes, the Simpsons is a good movie if not great. 6 out of 10 means 3 out of 5, that is equal to 'good'. I'll note down the pros and cones of the movie in points. Pros: 1) The plot is extremely stupid which suits such a movie where you expect such a lunatic story.2) The way the movie makers humiliated or rather made fun of the people in power is so hilarious.3) I loved Homer and his witty lines. I also liked Bart who was funny but sad.4) Short movie and so there was nothing too extra.Cons: 1) Apart from a few jokes, all the other jokes were somewhat lame.2) Animation could have improved a bit so that it could be said that Simpsons have progressed.Overall, the Simpsons is good but nowhere near to win the Oscars.

THE greatest experience of  summer 2007!,"Films that make one laugh within two minutes are very rare. Those that manage to do so within twenty seconds have practically never existed. Until now. The Simpsons Movie is a cracker right from the 20th Century Fox logo, where Ralph Wiggum pops up and does his own rendition of the company's celebrated fanfare. This shouldn't be unexpected, given the TV show, the most popular animated program of all time, has made fun of Fox countless times over the course of 18 seasons and 400 episodes. Now that the world's favorite yellow family has finally made the transition to the big screen, they even have the guts to do some self-spoofing, as the most famous dumb-ass in animation history, Homer Simpson (Dan Castellaneta), in a moment of truly inspired meta-cinematic madness (another one being Bart writing ""I will not illegally download this movie"" on the chalkboard), states while watching an Itchy & Scratchy movie with his kids: ""I can't believe we're paying to watch something we could get on the TV for free! If you ask me, everyone in this movie theater is a big sucker! Especially YOU!"". The last sentence is accompanied by his finger pointing directly at the camera, before the familiar title sequence begins, proving beyond any doubt that: a) Homer is deservedly considered the greatest television character ever aside from Fonzie; b) It was totally worth waiting 18 years for The Simpsons Movie.Having been kept a secret for months prior to the film's release, the plot is actually ridiculously simple: because of the growing concern for the environment, no one is allowed to dump garbage in Lake Springfield anymore. However, someone ignores this and dumps a load of pig, uh, crap in the water, causing a major pollution and prompting the President, Arnold Schwarzenegger (!), to charge Russ Cargill (Simpsons veteran Albert Brooks) with securing the area. Hence a gigantic glass dome that isolates Springfield from the rest of the world, prompting the inhabitants to put a price on the responsible's head. His name? Homer Simpson, of course (""D'oh!"").Naturally, he chooses to run off to Alaska, only to realize he will eventually have to deal with what he has done and seek forgiveness. But given he is Homer, he might as well try to have some fun on the way, leaving it to Marge (Julie Kavner), Lisa (Yeardley Smith) and everyone's favorite TV brat, Bart (Nancy Cartwright), to actually save the day.Considering the differences in creative freedom between big and small screen, one might think, even hope, The Simpsons Movie will be edgier than the TV version. Those people will be sorely disappointed, as the film tries to be nothing more than a 90-minute version of one of the best episodes of the show, and succeeds. Then again, it's not like the feature length counterparts of Beavis & Butt-head or South Park were that different from the network originals (aside from the swearing not being bleeped out in South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut). And in the particular case of The Simpsons, its longevity has made it an indelible, recognizable part of everyday life, meaning any changes in tone or themes would be like betraying the show's spirit. Thus, except for a few PG-13 gags regarding sexual orientation (Ned Flanders: ""The Good Lord is telling me to confess to something"" Homer: ""Gay gay gay gay gay gay gay..."") and bestiality (Homer's weird relationship with a pig), everything is just as all remember it: Lisa is still an annoying smart kid, Bart is still a master of mischief, his dad is still incredibly, deliriously moronic, Mr. Burns (creepy, despite only two scenes at his disposal) is still a vicious evildoer, and the movie is a rock-solid reminder of why the series is the ultimate cult program.All a die-hard Simpsons fan is looking for, he will find here. Hilarious physical gags? Check, in fact the bigger screen allows the 11 writers (just imagine if this gets an Oscar nomination for Best Original Screenplay), including creator Matt Groening, to come up with more spectacular stuff than usual (just watch as Homer finds himself between a rock and a hard place - literally!). Tender moments between Homer and Marge? Heck, probably the best in Simpsons history! The big, fat bloke strangling Bart? Check (""I'll teach you to laugh at something that's funny!""). Movie spoofs? Check (""Spider-Pig, Spider-Pig...""). Celebrity guest appearances? Just one (Tom Hanks; Arnie is voiced by Harry ""Mr. Burns"" Shearer)), but it is priceless.In the end, all these things turn The Simpsons Movie into an unstoppable gag-machine, a film that will make you laugh for the entirety of its running time, the most fun anyone will have in a cinema this year. Hell, it is so good it is hard, if not impossible, not to say: ""Yeah!"" once one of the characters, resuscitating the movie's self-awareness, asks the fundamental question: ""Sequel?"". Let's just hope it doesn't take another 18 years to make it...",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

The second time around, it doesn't hold up quite so well. Lots of amusing moments, but few jokes that go beyond that.The best comedies (and the best Simpsons episodes) are the ones that are still very funny after the first viewing.

In fact, this movie is so funny and well made that it is already #148 on IMDb's Top 250 Movies of All Time list.I won't disclose any plot details for fear of ruining a funny joke or gag, but I will say that there is actually a plot. It's not just 90 minutes random humor, though there is plenty of that. Everything about ""The Simpson's Movie"" is great, it all flows so nicely, and the jokes fly so fast and furious that you wish the movie would go on forever. I will caution some of you though, while it is a very mild PG-13, the film still makes fun of everything, and I do mean everything. From global warming, to republicans and democrats, to homosexuality, to Christianity, to making fun of itself  at one point Homer asks why we'd pay money to see something we could see for free on TV  and even makes fun of the rock band Green Day. So if you're easily offended, I wouldn't recommend the ""Simpson's Movie""Just like the TV show the voice talents fit their characters like a glove. Especially Dan Castellaneta as Homer and about 20 other characters. So take my word for it, ""The Simpson's Movie"" is downright hilarious, and very smartly done. It's just all around great, easily the best cartoon film ever made. I give it 10 out of 10. It's rated PG-13 for crude humor throughout.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Not So Mellow Yellow,"In 1987, producer James L Brooks was working on ""The Tracy Ullman Show"" when he got an idea. Some short, animated sketches would be great before the programs' commercial breaks, he thought. So, Brooks contacted cartoonist Matt Groening who suggested a number of stories about a dysfunctional family based on his own close relatives. At the time none of them could imagine that their idea would develop into ""The Simpsons"". An animated show that has become one of the longest-running sitcoms on American television.After three seasons, Matt Groening and his team expanded the sketches into a half-hour prime-time show. And people liked it. ""The Simpsons"" became the Fox Broadcasting Company's first series to land in the Top 10 at the Nielsen ratings. No wonder the studio began to investigate the possibilities of creating a feature film with its popular, yellow characters. It was ""just"" a matter of having enough time to produce the TV show and a full movie simultaneously.Right from the start, Matt Groening felt that a feature-length film would give him the opportunity to animate sequences too complex for the TV series. For a long time, he thought about making a parody of Walt Disney's ""Fantasia"" under the working title ""Simpstasia"", but that idea fell through. No useful script could be produced. And the concept of making an anthology-styled ""Treehouse of Horror"" movie was also scrapped at an early stage.Instead, Matt Groening set about crafting an old-fashioned, hand-drawn comedy with his experienced team of animators. He tried to include every single original ""Simpson"" character in the film, which meant that almost 100 voice actors had to reprise their roles from the TV series. And it worked. ""The Simpsons Movie"" was a great success. The only question now is how long it will be before we get to see the town of Springfield (and its inhabitants) on the big screen again.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
"The Best movie of Your Life, So Far","Like Classic Simpsons? Then you'll Love this! The Simpsons Movie combines all of our favourite elements of the beloved TV show, with some new stuff and make the best TV to movie adaption ever made. Though many were skeptical about Springfields jump to the silver screen, the Simpsons Movie was well-received across the globe, and for good reason. From the very beginning it's jam-packed with laughs that poke fun at everything including the very audience watching the movie. The animation is tip-top and shows a new side of Springfield in widescreen that could never be done on TV. This brings so much more to the movie, making it a fantastic view for both fans and newcomers to Groening's story about a dysfunctional family.Moreover, it's laced with tonnes of references that hark back to the early days of the show, eg. 'the ambulance crashed into the tree of Springfield Gorge'. The Die-hards revel in the countless call-backs to the show, while the outsiders enjoy the comedic film from a different perspective. You can also enjoy all of your secondary characters, almost all of which appear in the vast crowds throughout the movie. Those who prefer the older episodes rather than more recent ones of The Simpsons will be delighted to see this fine movie, with The Simpsons at their very best. All of this along with the worldwide phenomenon of new character SpiderPig and an epic storyline to match bring The Simpsons into their greatest adventure of all-time.

"Funny, Touching and Just Plain Entertaining","This movie has everything. I picked this up since I'm a fan of the show, and boy, does this movie live up to the no-doubt high standards of the show in its Golden Years. It's practically moving at the rate of a joke per minute and leaves barely a dull moment once it took off. The cast is fantastic featuring Tom Hanks and Albert Brooks alongside the typical show cast (with the voice of Dot from Animaniacs as tons of characters). The animation doesn't upstage the voices (which could be music is just absolutely phenomenal (see 'Spider-Pig') and the satire good or bad depending on how you think about it) but is still interesting and wildly entertaining, and the shading is good and the is just delicious and all along I knew that the writers were really doing their best to make this the best that they could, to make this work, and it shows. It really, really shows. For example, the words that Grandpa Simpson spouts during the church scene at the beginning just so well work their way into the plot, which I won't give away. Also if you didn't know already there IS a scene in which Bart skateboards to Krusty Burger naked, which is pretty dang hilarious, and comes with a huge shock...{They show Bart's wiener}...was not expecting that... Nevertheless a 10/10. 'Nuff Said.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
A Bit of a Let-Down but Still Funny and Charming,"Homer Simpson: We have a great life here in Alaska, and we're never going back to America again! What an extraordinary and refreshing television series the Simpsons is. What an average, over-hyped movie it is. Is it because the movie isn't as good as the series? No, the movie is practically identical to the series, it just works far better with a 30 minute television format rather than a 90 minute film format. The Simpsons Movie is funny and entertaining but it leaves you wanting more. There are scenes that will have you laughing hysterically but after the hour mark it starts to get kind of repetitive and a bit tedious. Now there are heartfelt sappy Kodak moments, but for the most part they work well in the movie. All in all I recommend The Simpsons Movie only if you are a fan of the series. If you like the television show you'll like the movie, if you don't like the television series you won't like it. Grade: B-",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
just wait for the DVD...,"First and foremost I'd like to say that I went to see this because I'm a huge fan of the simpsons.But like some fans I was disappointed.First they made Bart into a soft emo piece of s.h.i.t not the brat we used to know.Not enough emphasis on the other characters,such as Chief wiggum ,ralph and/so for it.Second,there's barely any gags other than the ones seen on the trailers. The only reason I gave it 5 out of 10 is that they kept the goofy Homer we love otherwise...In conclusion it's not a total flop but this should've came long ago,so my advice is just wait for the DVD which should come out for the holidays.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
mostly for fans but still funny and good-natured,"Based on the beloved television show comes this enjoyable animated feature centering around Springfield's lovable suburban family. The story chronicles hapless dope Homer, loyal wife Marge, intelligent do-gooder Lisa, troublemaker Bart, and precocious baby Maggie in a doomsday scenario when they inadvertently cause the town to fall under siege, eventually leading a bureaucratic EPA official and the obtuse U.S. President Schwarzenegger to call for its extermination. Will probably deliver the most satisfaction to dedicated fans of the long-running TV show, but the animation and voice work are terrific, and there are consistently funny gags, in-jokes, and parodies. Story isn't very inspired, and the jokes never reach the level of uproarious, but it's pleasant and easy enough to take. ***",,Anonymous,Animation
"The Simpson's Movie might just seem like a longer episode, but it captures the humour and likability that the series is famous for.","I'm not a massive fan of TV shows turning into movies, most of the time they are just chancing their luck and trying to earn some quick dollar. Only a select few that have garnered a following or popular fan base deserve the big screen treatment. The Simpsons is one of them. In this ninety minute episode, residents of Springfield have been the biggest contributor to environmental pollution. The government take action and seal them off in a giant dome, before eventually wanting to blow the city up. It's up to the Simpsons to save the city. If you aren't a fan of the series, then you shouldn't be watching this...it's not going to change your opinion. It really is just a longer episode with a heightened scale of grandeur, improved fluid animation and a variety of different jokes. If you are like me and enjoy the series, then you'll be sure to come away from this feeling entertained. Plenty of pop culture references from a pig dressing up as famous characters (Spider-Pig and Harry Plopper...) to Green Day dissolving in an acidic lake. It's what The Simpsons is famous for, consistently humorous references injected with a quick witted script to appeal to all audiences. We've got lines of dialogue that joke about race, homosexuality, age...they've pretty much covered all the bases. It's obviously nothing crude, adhering to the tame nature of the TV series. A bountiful of past Springfield residents get plenty of screen time. There is always something amusing about Ned Flanders, and he does have the most quotable line. ""Thank you lord for this bountiful PENIS!?"". The plot moves along speedily, perhaps too fast in certain areas and does delve into issues about marriage which are unfortunately shrouded by the main story. The humour does grow tiresome by the end and my smile slowly melted away. However, this is a delightful watch. It's not going to set the cinematic world on fire, but it's good enough to pass the time.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Very amusing and entertaining.,"Like the series, the film is amusing, entertaining and exciting. Despite being a wee bit gory and pushing the jokes somewhat, this film will with no doubt entertain a wide audience, adults and children alike. This is the sort of film that if you watch once, you CERTAINLY won't catch quite ALL the jokes.A bit surprisingly for something about the Simpsons, this film concerns environmental issues. It starts with Greenday and Lisa having problems with telling people about the environment. Next Homer's dad has a ""vision from God"" in Church and maniacally foretells of misfortune to come, in the form of a twisted tail etc. Marge particularly feels that bad stuff is soon going to happen and when Homer spots a pig with a chef's hat it seems like it will come all too soon...Enjoy the hilarious, exciting, engaging, disgusting Simpsons Movie! :-)7 and a half out of ten.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Whoo hoo! Best movie ever,"Ever since I've started seeing previews for this movie, I've been excited. Could it possibly be? Classic Simpsons humor brought to the big screen without mangling the characters that have become so real and interesting over the years? Well, I'm happy to say that this movie delivered, and then some. Hearty laughs were interspersed with genuine heartfelt moments (seriously, I got teary-eyed at one point), and the magic of the early seasons of the show was captured flawlessly. Homer wasn't just a food-monster with a few one-liners every so often, and all the other characters had similar depth. All this was achieved within a mere one and a half hours.I applaud all my favorite Simpsons writers (yes, you too, Swartzwelder, much as you try to avoid the spotlight). This movie has waited decades to be made, but it was certainly worth the wait. I can't wait to see it again.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

A Nutshell Review: The Simpsons Movie,"I'm a big, big fan of the Simpsons, and word that the movie version of the hit TV series would be made had been out for the longest time possible. Toying between trying to cast actors in a life-action movie (rumoured at one point to have Bruce Willis playing Homer because of the err, balding pate), and sticking to its 2D version of yellow skin and four fingers on each hand, I'm glad that the movie was done in the latter version, simply because casting will be a nightmare to flesh out the inhabitants of Springfield, and 2D allows for many insane jokes and situations to be played out without reliance on CGI and the likes.And it paid off big time, and well worth the extremely long wait. While the movie version of the Simpsons might seem like an extended version of a typical animated episode on TV, this is everything you'd come to expect, and more! I won't spoil the movie's plot in my review, but suffice to say our favourite family is back for more madcap adventures, and being in a feature length movie allowed for the characters emote more than what we see on TV. There's some room here for some serious character development, especially Marge, Bart and even Lisa entering a new phase of her life, while Homer is, well, being just Homer.With plenty of sight gags, inside jokes, not too subtle jabs at the big summer movies this year like Spider-man and Harry Potter, it's incredibly hard not to laugh every few seconds for the keen eyed viewer, or guffaw at the dialogue or classic Simpsons styled comedy we've come to enjoy from the series. The fast and furious nature the laughs get delivered is bound to keep fans delighted, and win over those who are watching the family and the Springfield folks for the very first time. You just can't get enough of the voice talents of Dan Castellaneta, Julie Kavner, Nancy Cartwright, Yeardley Smith, Harry Shearer and Hank Azaria, as well as a whole host of cameo voices as they embark on 90 minutes of pure entertainment. If you've just survived a hard day's work, The Simpsons Movie is almost guaranteed to chase those blues away.Stay throughout the end credits, where you'll be entertained by more clips near the beginning, the middle, and right at the end of the credits roll, played to the tune of some of the most insane songs ever written.This is the best Simpsons movie... so far!

"A Very Good 90 Min Episode, True to the Series (For Both Better and Worse).","The Simpson Movie has most of the great qualities of the TV series - pointed iconoclastic social satire (digs at religion, bureaucracy, crass materialism), clever slapstick humor, dialog that is both intelligent and intelligently stupid, and great visual gags (esp in the first 15 minutes). Much of the humor references some of the best specific scenes from various episodes (probably only long-time fans will understand these jokes).'The Simpsons Movie' is basically a very good (not great) episode extended to 90 min - that's both reassuring and a slightly disappointing: Reassuring because it reaffirms the seemingly infinite versatility and mutability of the show's formula, but also a little disappointing because the writers/producers/etc don't take as many chances with the formula as I would've liked. I was hoping for something that would transcend the TV show the way 'South Park: Bigger, Longer, and Uncut', took that that show's bawdy, offensive humor to new levels, then transformed it into a statement (and big middle-finger) at the MPA for it's misguided priorities and hypocrisy. The Simpson Movie never goes much farther than the TV show; the PG-13 rating does enable the writers to be a little more naughty with some of the jokes, but not in a way that enhances the TV show's insight, irreverence, or overall effectiveness.As an ardent fan maybe I'm being too hard on the film and expecting too much. The series has been on so long and lampooned virtually every aspect of U.S. culture (and numerous others), maybe there just isn't anywhere left for the creative team to go they haven't at least touched on already. Taken as it is The Simpson movie is an intelligently written, visually clever satire. And even if it's not as potent as the best episodes it's still entertaining and mostly satisfying for both casual and avid fans.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
They stuck to what works,"The makers of the Simpsons did exactly what they do on a weekly basis with their long running TV show. They made a well written story, used smart, political, and at the same time silly humor, and made everyone in the theater laugh hysterically. They did good by sticking to the primary role of every character. For instance, Ralph and Otto made brief but hilarious appearances, which is what they usually do during the show. They didn't try too hard to get every character a laugh in the movie so they could stick to the main characters. Which brings me to another point. The Homer v. Bart sub-plot was very well done. Barts pretty much always been on homers side (except for when Bart gets emancipated) and the fact that Bart finally drew the line in this movie was kind of cool. The only reason I'm not giving this move a 10 is because it was too short. If its this funny, make the damn movie 2 hours long at least! I highly recommend this movie to anyone.

20 years in the making? Maybe they should have waited another 20,"This film was so far below average the English language has no words I can utilise to describe it. As a comedy, it lacks almost little to no comedic value. The excessive inclusion of all characters is something you would expect from an action movie loaded with A-List actors who under-perform. I can see why it was 20 years in the making and I am a huge The Simpsons fan. Short of a few mediocre jokes, I found this film to be almost a sell-out by Groening and Simon. I appreciate the fact they were creating the season at the same time, but I myself could've written a far better screenplay for this film based soley on my addiction and favorable desire to aspire to achieve anything near to Groening and the staff writers. All in all I think the film is about a 2-3/10. The animation was worthy of credit, but I associate my thinking with computer gaming and animation. A computer game can have the best graphics, the best voice-overs and the most popular production and marketing team behind it.... yet without a decent script and game play, games tend to flop. Which is what I have inevitably deduced The Simpsons Movie to be.... a flop. I am glad however that Groening and Simon have made a decent amount from this, Fox pay them nothing and 20 years of great hard work makes them deserve ALL of the royalties and publicity they are due.

"Wow, 100% worth the 17 year wait!","Went to an advance screening of this yesterday, with a certain amount of trepidation.I have loved The Simpsons for nearly 17 years, and have passed on the tradition to my kids. There isn't any other cartoon/sit-com that has the same level of humour. As a parent I watch it on a completely different level to my children, and all the risqué content goes over their heads.My fear was that it wouldn't live up to my expectations, as there had been rumours of a feature length movie for years. Turns out my fears were wholly unjustified! The laughs start with the opening credits, and are still going on when the final credits roll.Everything I'd wanted to see in a Simpsons movie was there, and more. The quality of animation was top notch, and there was plenty of rude jokes to satisfy my now adult sense of humour. The clever thing is though, my kids don't pick up on these and therefore I don't have to restrict their viewing.The producers of The Simpsons could have jumped on the movie bandwagon a long time ago, and cashed-in, but what they have given us shows they have waited, built up ideas and fan bases for individual characters and produced a gem for us to repay our many years of dedicated viewing! I was also pleased to see plenty of other adults there of a similar age to me, all laughing out loud.This is an all time must-see movie, and one I will be seeing again without a doubt.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Not bad but not great either,"This film gets off to a promising start with some great gags and set pieces, Bart's naked skateboarding and Homer's antics with a pig. However, as soon as what would have been known in the t.v. series as the 1st act is finished problems start developing. Part of the problem is that things become a bit too plot driven as other people have on this page have mentioned. Also fans will be disappointed that popular characters feature very little (Apu, Mo, Flanders etc.), this is particularly grating as new extremely lame characters are given quite a bit of screen time. A particularly cloying and crappy sentimental sub-plot featuring an annoyingly voiced Irish Greenpeace loving peacenik that Lisa has fallen in tow with springs to mind.None of this would matter that much if the quality control of the writing had been a little bit more vigorous. There is some very good and funny material in this film but all too often a woefully unfunny line or gag will totally kill the momentum and ruin your' enjoyment of the film, and aspects of the story with great comic potential aren't allowed time to develop( I for one would have liked to see more of the pig).Yes it is of a much higher standard than most episodes from the last 3 years but for me that is really good enough. I would liked to have see the Simpsons go out with a bang and this film is well, not a whimper, but a dull thud.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation

All hype Little substance,"When I was 12 I was hyped beyond words about the Simpsons movie. I was so happy to hear about it. I waited all year to see it until the end of Summer. I saw it and opinions where definaly mixed.STORY
The Simpsons movie starts out very strong. Lots of comedy and humor. Then 30 minutes in after an entire Simpsons episode but slowly paced it takes a akward turn. Homer Simpson starts to dump pig feces in a lake and that sounds hilarious but the worst part is that it's the driving force for the whole franchise. So since Lake Spring feild becomes a toxic garbage pit the EPA comes in and takes over. It rips off Stephen King's Dome. They escape the Dome and move elsewhere. Things get dumb in Alaska.Thus it goes on this over the top convoluted mess where they need to move somewhere else but the EPA tries looking for themThis is such a limiting story since the Simpsons never ever change. There never needs to be any questions to be answered since at the time the entire tv series was only 18. Where only Mod Flanders dies of a T-shirt to the face.The comedy was hit or miss. Mostly just sad tired references. Too much Meta pointing out that people just see TV based movies just to make money. That it's pointless. Unlike Macross the movie or Fire walk with me the Twin Peaks Special.CHARACTERS
Homer is dumb but lovable
Marge is the supportive but naggy wife
Bart is a rebel a loser but a Kyle with sass
Lisa is a studious nerd. But she's in love with a boy. A boring little nerdy boy who makes the story even more akward. Imagine a 14 year old in a 10 year old's body? The atheist kid. Yeah. He's not that good. I don't even remember his name. He plays music though.At least 90 percent of the characters are more likable than they are now.ANIMATION
The animation is mostly stiff like new Simpsons. This has comedic charm but no it's not like 1994 Simpsons where there was actually good animation or god forbid a Disney movie. There are nice particle effects and other Sakuga but mostly TV show level. Simpsons movie is filled to the brim with bad CGI that looks so obvious. Overall passable.SOUND
Oooh ahh it has Green Day in it.Overall much like the Simpsons nothing was gained or learned other than a psuedo- enviromentalist message which is generic to say the least.Don't waste your time on this cartoon unless you are a diehard fan.

I was not impressed with this movie one bit, the sight gags were barely humorous to me (they have done better skits on the show). This movie would have been worth it if it was done on FOX TV as an hour and a half Simpsons TV special, that way I wouldn't have paid nine bucks to sit through it.

The movie is so juvenile in writing (a naughty 7 year old could've wrote this) and it's a waste of the Simpsons writers' ideas. The art and animation is stunning though.

Disappointing,"Oh dear, the Simpsons has gone downhill these last few years, and the movie's no exception: layered with weak, predictable, basic comedy, a dull, one-dimensional storyline and that relentless Hollywood-style soundtrack, one can't help but feel that Groening & Co. just haven't really tried with this movie, nor with any Simpsons productions of late, come to that; it's just about the money, now. Now, I'll admit, there are some high-lights to the movie: an entertaining parody on state-sponsored adverts starring Tom Hanks, for example, & a parody of 'President Arnold Schwarzenegger' by (predictably, but none-the-less funny) regular character Rainier Wolfcastle, for instance. But these moments are few and far between, I'm sad to say; the rest is just pumped out with weak humour, weak, over-stretched parodies, and silly music that serves only to undermine what intelligence exists within the movie. And to think what the Simpsons was just 5-10 years ago: intelligent, lovable, unique, etc. Groening & Co. need to stop counting the pennies, and instead realise that what made the Simpsons so funny and lovable was, simultaneously, its mockery, not embracement, of modern culture, & its embracal of old, American values.

Plenty of laughs for anyone who is or was a fan of the Simpson's,"The movie was awesome. Many here seemed to think that the movie will suck like some of the latest seasons of the show.

There is something for everyone to laugh at in this movie just as the show poked fun at everything in society. There is actually a lot of relevant current issues type of humor to be had and such things include blow back, wiretapping and general trust in your government. Other humor is just good old fashioned Simpson's humor (the movie begins with Itchy and Scratchy) such as Homer tiling his roof and Flanders gets owned plenty of times. There is some irrelevant family guy like humor but it is kept to a minimum and after a while the plot really picks up.

After all, i must say, i'm from Argentina, and i saw it in Spanish, nevertheless, having listened the series in other languages, i must say the Spanish version is flawless (altough i prefer the old voice over work, Humberto Velez's voice was better than this). The Mexican voice actors are great doing some little things in the characters. Bout the movie, i must say that its a never ending continuity of gags. You never see them coming, but inmediatly, you start laughing your guts out. It goes beyond, where the series couldn't go in 18 years. For those who say it's a long episode. Well, maybe you're right, but it also works as a movie... but if you want to analyze it, go and talk to Syd Field. Obviously it's not the so acclaimed humor that you could see on the first seasons of the show, it's more like the absurd kind of stuff that i love. Homer is stupider than ever, and that's one thing i thank. I mean, that's OK with that dysfunctional family, but what i need is... the ball in the crotch. This movie was for me as Itchy and Scratchie was for Bart, I thank that i hadn't wait 40 years to watch it. So, here is my advice: Don't wait no longer. Get your ticket, buy a big bag of popcorn and enjoy.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
"An Adaptation That's Doggedly Loyal, But Not Exceptional","After eighteen years of televised ups and downs, the Simpson family has finally tackled an adventure that's too big for the small screen. At the time, I can remember, this felt like a decent spot for one last, big hurrah. Who could've imagined the series would still be running today, a decade and a half later?But that's another topic for another time. Back in the bygone days of 2007, it seemed the franchise was winding down and there was some concern that a full ninety-minute story might be more than this dysfunctional, small town American family could handle. The good news: it's an almost effortless transition, delivering somewhat greater consequences without betraying the light, sarcastic nature that's made the show so well-loved. The bad: well, it's a little bland. We get a couple naughty words, one inspired skateboard chase that never would've seen the light of day on Fox and a whole lot of fan service, but the bulk of the writing is sterile and by-the-numbers. Despite the presence of something like three-hundred ancillary characters, maybe a dozen have meaningful roles and several of those are wholly original to the movie. It has laughs, but they're easy and homogenized. Scraps of power, like Marge's video recording when she reaches the end of her rope, derive their punch from the preceding 7,000 hours of TV coverage and not the film's self-contained story. It visits new locales, but the show already did that six times a season.To its credit, The Simpsons Movie does feel like The Simpsons, but not prime-era The Simpsons. Acceptable, not an embarrassment, with some good bits for long-term fans and fresh faces alike, but far from essential. There's something to be said for refusing to reinvent the wheel, but also for going back to the same old well. This is an accent piece, not a focus.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation

Homer As the All-Time Movie Star -- I Think Not!,"THE SIMPSONS MOVIE, like the long running SIMPSONS TV show, is a theme that was good a long time ago, but has been worn out till it's flat. Sure there are a handful of laughs here, but not enough to make it a classic --- or anything close to a classic. Most likely it'll be gone from the multiplexes within 4 weeks to resurface at Christmas in DVD.Now look at the input on the IMDb website. If you can believe that over 60% of the audience rated this movie a 10, and that its #46 in the list of ALL TIME classics, then you'd have to believe this: That it's better than Wizard of Oz. That it's better than Snow White or any of the Walt Disney classics that endured for 60 to 70 years. That it's better than Gone With The Wind. That it's better than To Kill a Mockingbird. That it's better than Bridge on the River Kwai. That it's almost as good as any of the 3 great Star Wars movies --- et cetera.Since the Simpsons is mostly adult humor that kids enjoy rather than children's humor that adults enjoy; one can't suppose the high score is a bunch of kids gone wild. I think this is another example of studio generated corruption of the IMDb website. Studios have falsified good reviews for decades (they can be bought for cash) so it follows they'd stoop to the same thing here.A rating of 46th best movie of all time for The Simpsons Movie is pure nonsense. I wish the studios would keep hands off and let real movie fans input their opinions. As a security person, I don't know any way IMDb can stop this and still let you and I input our opinions.",1.0,Anonymous,Animation
A good extended episode,"It's widely regarded that 'The Simpsons' TV show has been long past its prime of the early through late nineties. Nowadays it's still watched, but it doesn't look like it will ever regain its prestige. However, that didn't stop them trying to make a movie out of the long-running series in 2007 - roughly a decade after people thought it had peaked.Perhaps one thing that's normally commonplace when a TV show makes the jump onto the big screen, is that everything is bigger and on more of a grander scale. Yet, due to 'The Simpsons' being on the air for so long and because it's animated, therefore not bound by the limitations of special effects and budget etc, pretty much everything has already been seen and done (ala that episode of 'South Park' that made the same point!). Therefore there's very little that's fresh to see by watching 'The Simpsons Movie.' I know there's a certain amount of 'meta' humour poking fun at the audience for going to the cinema to watch something they could view for free on the television, but it's a point that's kind of on the nose.Although, saying all that (and speaking as a fan of 'The Simpson' - in their heyday) I have to say that the film is an enjoyable enough romp. There's literally nothing here to distinguish it from an episode (well, a good one) besides its extended runtime. All the characters are there, although most are only on screen for a few seconds to throw a line or two in there. The film focuses in on the central family and recycles many old plots from various episodes to create something that appears new (if you don't look too closely).If you like the show then you should definitely like this. It's one of those movies that you probably shouldn't pay to see (especially at cinema prices), but if you get the chance to watch it for free then there are definitely worse ways to spend an hour and a half. It's just a pity today's episodes can't even match the quality of the film.Plus did any future episode ever say what happened to the stand-out star of this film, i.e. 'Spider-pig?' He definitely deserves his own spin-off series!",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Just like the glory days from many seasons ago,"I too was thinking this movie wouldn't be so great and would be just like the most recent episodes: lackluster and just boring. Boy was I wrong! The movie is definitely a return to the Simpsons of old, when the show really knocked your funny bone out and kept firing away clever jaunts at the most random points. I have never been in a theater where it was constant laughter after laughter. There are a couple of crude images...and I mean crude as in ""what they couldn't do on TV"", so you may want to be cautious if bringing the kids. But overall, it's a terrific movie, well-done with the humor and the slapstick that you would expect from the Simpsons.Oh, and if you're a true fan, you will want to stay through the entire credits. Most people in my theater left just as they started and they missed out on a few ""encore points""",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Not what you expect!,"After 20 years the Simpson's finally decided to make a movie. And i must say it is not what you will expect. I was there opening day and also was in th first show at my local theater. As I was standing in line i overheard that people were expecting something of a normal Simpson's episode with a long story line. However what we got was something of a complete different nature. I wont spoil the story for anyone. However i must say there are several stories going on at once. And if you pay close enough attention you can spot a whole lot of old characters in the show popping up and saying their infamous one liners with their own stories.However my main thought at the end of this movie was that Thank god fox did not sell out the franchise and make a movie for the kids. They made it for the die hard fans who grew up on this show and much Kudos to the team behind The Simpson's who made sure of that. And since the movie did not follow on like the show there is a sense of new direction for the Simpson's. As the movie progresses I got the sense that this movie is not the last, but of a series of movies which will be pumped out. Think of it not as one long episode but as homage to the parody of modern culture and inspiration over the years that the Simpson's have used.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Some Glimpses Of The Old Genius,"The Simpsons Movie is curious. What was one of the greatest television programmes ever broadcast until season eleven, and a very good show until season fourteen, eventually nosedived by the time it reached season fifteen, and the quality of this monumentally enjoyable series plummeted into the rock bottom territory in finds itself in today. The film is an unusual experience, as it offers a mixture of both the great and awful periods of the show and, to its credit, creates a new standalone experience of its own, meaning that despite any criticisms, at least it feels like a legitimate film, not just an overlong television episode.The story itself however is all over the place, an effect I suspect the writers may have suffered after nearly twenty years of the show being written to fit twenty minute time slots rather than nearly ninety. The plot of Homer bring about the family's exile from Springfield after causing a major environmental disaster, and their eventual attempt to return to the town when they hear of an evil plot hatched by a dastardly government agent, is amusing and gives the Simpson family plenty of screen-time, particularly Lisa who gets a surprisingly affecting love story sub-plot, but as it progresses and more crazy and uneven plot-lines develop, it feels like the writers are struggling to keep it moving forward. Despite avoiding the trap of feeling like an extra-long episode, the film's plot just seems incapable of sustaining itself throughout the whole running time, and occasionally becomes desperate for momentum.Despite this, Matt Groening and his team should take pride that at times a bit of the old magic that made the show so legendary in its time manages to shine through, and some excellent jokes and one liners are breathed into The Simpsons again, something which looked almost impossible given the standard of the series for the last few years. But the film certainly has some extremely funny moments, including the popular Spider-Pig. The cast are all on fine form, some actually seem better than they've been in sometime, and some of the past guest stars make an appearance, such as Joe Mantegna and Albert Brookes, who makes a hilarious return as shady government agent Russ Cargil.That being said, it's not always hilarious, and although we see some of the old high quality again, we also see a lot of evidence of the huge drop in standard of The Simpsons, with some blatantly unfunny moments and some cringingly bad jokes. I firmly believe the improvement of the show's animation only emphasized the poor quality of the newer episodes, and similarly with the film, the high definition, crystal-clear picture of the new and improved animation often reminds us that this is not the same Simpsons that changed the way we view television comedy series. This constant reminder of the drop in quality isn't helped by the fact that there are just times where the film is not funny. It tries very hard to be, giving it an occasional feeling of self-consciousness that doesn't feel right and actually makes the jokes more unfunny and a little awkward. This mixture of both hilarious and banal jokes is strange, and it really feels as though we're watching a classic older episode that has been spliced together with a terrible new one.Another weakness that in the film's defence was to be expected, up to a point, is the lack of adequate screen-time for most of the supporting characters. In fairness, expecting every one of the many minor characters to appear for a large amount of time is unreasonable, as even if they were each given just five minutes to themselves, the film could have run for hours. However, some characters, such as Chief Wiggum and Mr Burns, are given a satisfying amount of time to shine, merely a few funny lines or a couple of amusing moments, but that is plenty of time, and in that case, the same certainly should have been expected for other hugely popular characters like Krusty, Moe or Apu, who, although make a brief appearance, are robbed of any memorable or enjoyable moments. I don't ask for huge sections devoted entirely to these specific characters, just the couple of lines or small moments that would have satisfied everyone.Worse than this is that some characters don't even make a real appearance at all, appearing only briefly in the background, such as Mrs Krabappel, Barney, or my personal favourite character Sideshow Bob, whose scene was cut entirely. During the film, there is a fantastic shot of all the townspeople, looking fantastically detailed in the sharp and refined high-definition picture, but what is the point of even animating them at all if they don't get the screen-time they deserve? Realistically, it would have only added a maximum of ten minutes to the running time, which I can safely say we all could have survived with.Despite these faults, there is something the film should be applauded for- it gives depth back to the Simpsons themselves. One of the truly great things about the series was that the characters were three-dimensional. They had an emotional aspect that felt real, something sorely missed from the series for several years. The film brings that back. For the first time in years, we feel for the characters. We want Homer to do right by his family. We want Lisa to be happy in herself. We even want Bart to say ""eat my shorts"". This vital ingredient has been absent from the show for some time, and is most welcome in the film.The Simpsons Movie is an interesting film. It mixes good and bad aspects of the show, along with touches of its own unique style, and overall succeeds pretty well. Whether it's a nostalgic glimpse of the show's glory days, a sad look at the state it's in today, or just an entertaining ninety minutes you're after, this film has it.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Flawless,This movie was pure gold. In the start he laughs came more frequent. But in the end it became a movie with a more semi-serious story.

An 87 min long TV-Series,I love to watch the TV-Series so that was the main reason I went to see this movie.

The movie is mediocre at best just like the last couple of series seasons. Sure there are some funny bits and pieces in it but way to seldom for it to be a good movie.

Without revealing much, the requisite number of guest stars making cameo voice-overs is there (I won't say who). The crowd I saw it with tonight seemed to have a fun time with it.

Everything you'd expect from a Simpson's movie... and more,"I've been a massive Simpsons fan ever since I can remember, and so when I discovered they were making a movie I was excited to say the least. And the film did not disappoint. The basic plot of the film is Homer accidentally pollutes Lake Springfield causing the government to cordon off the whole town. The towns residents are obviously upset at this, and so the movie plays out. Probably the best thing about this film to me was the fact that it included a huge range of small yet familiar characters and used our already existing knowledge of them to make us laugh. Homer is on top form giving us a laugh a minute, and there are some familiar famous faces making us giggle too.So, would I recommend this movie? Yes. Even though I personally think the latter series' of the Simpsons haven't been as good as earlier ones, I think the film is a separate entity and doesn't reflect this. As usual the comedy can be taken on separate levels so all the family will enjoy it.On the trailer it says, ""Eighteen years in the making..."" and it shows. They saved up all the very best stuff. It was everything I expected and more. It did not disappoint, and I came about in a much better mood than when I came in.For me, it couldn't of got any better.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Better than I remembered it to be,"I remember being underwhelmed and disappointed when I saw this in cinemas back in 2007. A big fan of ""The Simpsons"" (Really, who isn't?), it has still taken me thirteen years to watch the long-awaited movie again. My initial reaction to the film was wrong. Perhaps, as can often be the case, expectations are too strong and a critical analysis can be far too premature around something as big as a movie adaptation of one of the greatest TV shows of all time, so it requires another viewing once the dust has settled and the spotlight has moved on. Not that I am advocating that the second viewing be more than ten years later! But this time certainly let me forget most of the film and allow me to view it as though it was a first viewing. ""The Simpsons Movie"" is better than I remember.Springfield Lake is a cesspit. The townsfolk of Springfield have been dumping in it for so long that the lake has turned almost volcanic. When the band members of Green Day are killed on the lake when their barge sinks into the sludge, Mayor Quimby - in a rare moment of being proactive - announces that the lake is to be cleaned out and then cordoned off to prevent any more dumping. A few days later, Homer saves a pig mascot from being butchered at Krusty Burger. He adopts the pig and acquires a silo to keep the pig's crap in. When it is full to bursting, Homer decides to break the barrier and dump it into Springfield Lake. This becomes the straw that breaks the camel's back, and it causes such horrendous pollution that it attracts the attention of the US government, who, in order to save the rest of America from the pollution, drop a large dome on to Springfield, sealing the inhabitants inside the town and preventing any entry in or out.There are plenty of good laughs here and a good contingent of our favourite Springfield characters are given screen-time. The story is a bit pedestrian for a movie and by the time we are in the second half of the film in Alaska the laughs dry up and it does start to drag a little. Still, ""The Simpsons Movie"", although a far-cry from the show at its best, is by no means near it at its worst, or even most average.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

I went into the cinema thinking of the recent seasons, and expected nothing more then an OK movie, with a few good laughs, but nothing special. It was more then a few good laughs, but it still didn't match up to the classics, back in seasons 3 - 9.1. The plot wasn't great, and it certainly wasn't 'classical Simpsons'. The Simpson's has always been ridiculous, at the edge of realism. I guess the writers just tried to be a bit too epic. Saying that, there was little subplot, and what was there had been done before.2. Too short. The Simpsons have had so many years to make a movie, and 90 minutes, although reasonable, just didn't seem enough.3. Important 'backup' characters had too little screen time. Don't get my wrong, the writers tried their best to fit some of the less important, yet essential characters (sometimes) into the story, but as I've said before, 90 minutes was simply not enough.4. The humor was good. Sometimes. There were jokes that I thought could have been worthy of the classics. Then there were jokes that were mildly funny. Then there was somethings they just tried to fit in for the hell of it. I didn't like Spiderpig.But otherwise, the movie was decent.

About the Same as the Television Series,"30 July 2007. The movie version has the same raunchy and rather insolent manner of the television series. The humor, the characters are the same. The transfer to the big screen captured the feel and animated enjoyment of the television experience. However, the big film feature was missing the anticipatory big name guess stars that this venture might have had an opportunity to portray. There was some good moral tales along with the more violent and adult-skewed scenes. The movie seemed to waiver in its attempt to continue onto the big arching theme of disaster and maintain the intimate level of television entertainment. The opportunity to focus on some of the minor characters was lost and the opportunity for more depth overlooked for the more pure entertainment, action.

Simpsons creators get the big screen adaptation right,"Matt Groening and co. waited and waited for the right time for a Simpsons movie and they deliver with this film. It's not some great Simpsons epic that people seem to expect when a TV show becomes a feature film and it shouldn't be because most of those films tank.The premise of ""The Simpsons Movie"" is a long episode plot (they even throw in a ""to be continued"" to make fun of the TV medium.) that entails Homer screwing up against (this time majorly) and forcing Springfield to be contained in a glass dome by the EPA. Longtime writers James L. Brooks and Matt Groening do the right thing by focusing the plot on Homer, the franchise's most successful character. The film's Homer gags are fresh and true to Simspsons style. Many TV writers trying to make the movie based on their show the equivalent of its most amazing episode would try and over-incorporate the large cast of lovable characters, but ""The Simpsons Movie"" keeps them as mostly cameos, a decent amount of which are funny and it allows the film to stay focused.If you watch ""The Simpsons Movie"" looking for that big ""be-all"" for the series, you'll like experience some measure of disappointment, but those people who are fans of or at least admire the series and don't want their minds to be blown away with Simpsons humor and awesomeness, you will get your laughs (some of which you don't even normally get because of strict TV ratings) and you'll have fun.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

The glaring faults of any movie become transparent when you laugh so hard at it,"In what has perhaps been one of the drollest and most insipid summers in recent Hollywood history, it is not surprising that the ""saviour"" of the cineworld would turn out to be those weird, squiggly-lined, yellow folk from the tellybox. Yes it's The Simpsons movie, or rather, at last it is The Simpsons' movie, for we have waited many a full moon (and many cries of D'oh!, most of which from me whilst watching the latest series) for Matt Groening, James L. Brooks et al to finally enlighten us as to what Springfield's finest would add to grand old experience of the cinema. Indeed, that curiosity slowly but severely began to wain, with every passing series of The Simpsons becoming even more depressing than the last. As a huge mark for the programme I felt increasingly concerned about the motivation for diluting what was once the pinnacle of television programmes into a sad pantomime of its former self. Homer, despite being wackier than ever, was no longer funny. And Bart, ever the smart mouthed rebel, was just not cool anymore. Had the series lost its edge? Or was it just impossible to keep up the unenviable task of maintaining the quality of the greatest TV sitcom of all time? All the reasons questioned are valid, but milking the cashcows that are The Simsons means that long after their peak (a good solid decade now) we are still enduring our yellow friends deep into the 21st century. Like any great pugilist staggering on his last legs, The Simpsons refused to stop running, even after its creator, Matt Groening, left the show. So forgive me for approaching The Simpsons Movie with considerable trepidation.So given the stigma of what The Simpsons had become still fresh in my mind, I am proud to say I entered the screening with an open mind. And despite what any expectations were, despite how sick I had grown of hearing Homer or Bart belt out yet another token catchphrase, in the 87 minutes I spent in and around Springfield that night, I laughed harder at the movie then I had at any movie seen this year. And it isn't hard to explain why. The writing is back. The team that made the Simpsons what it is reminded me of what made the series great. It is politically savvy, boisterously inventive and the stupid jokes are actually smartly played. The movie doesn't rely on audiences trusting Homer's reputation enough to laugh at anything he says. When a character makes you laugh, it is because they are are funny, not because of nostalgia. Even silly jokes that don't mean anything like the now infamous ""Spider pig"" have a sense of investment behind the delivery.And all of this is crucial, because as far as the story goes, The Simpsons Movie is as mundane and formulaic as the dumbest Hollywood blockbuster around. There is little room for Lisa's new found romance to mean anything, and Bart's desire for fatherly support in spite of his own will seem recycled to regular Simpsonites and clichéd to the uninitiated. It is also worth pointing out that the movie fails to fully realise the potential of the cinematic medium, with only the score, and an abundance of undercooked character cameos (Mr Burns only gets two scenes!) failing to convince the cinema that it belongs there. And yet none of this matters much, for you will be laughing too hard to care. The important thing is that faith has been rightly restored in a series that had stubbornly refused to get off the TV train when the lights were still on. But smiling at the word ""Doh!"" for the first time in years is something worth forgiving for all its faults.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
"predictably a 90-minute ""simpsons"" episode","By the time of the release of ""The Simpsons Movie"" in 2007, the television show that bears its name had been on for nearly twenty seasons and had practically become its own institution. ""The Simpsons"" has become the gauge by which animated programs have become judged time and time again. To a point the show has also changed the complexity and number of situations available to the sit-com format, to say little of what it has shown to be the limitless nature of branding and mass marketing. It would nice to think that a big screen version of the show would again cause waves within the industry.Instead ""The Simpsons Movie"" is merely a bigger (widescreen, et al), longer version of the show. Compared to the bulk of the output of the show during the mid-2000's the movie has far more to offer than the show, including superior animation. The main storyline presents a post-""Inconvenient Truth"" environmental story whereby the town of Springfield is at the brink of being an environmental disaster. Of course, the obese, bumbler, Homer, tips them over the edge, causing the Environmental Protection Agency to enclose the town with a huge dome, which creates havoc and mob rule. It's a good, topical plot line for the frequently liberal-minded show and one that does sustain the running time, but unfortunately it doesn't seem to have the repeat value of many of the shows best episodes.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Entertaining, but it could have been so much more","Matt Groening's phenomenally successful cartoon creation comes to the big screen with plenty of laughs accompanying it. However, the transfer from television to film is not carried off well. The film seems to be caught between being three very funny episodes of the show and being a down-to-earth-dysfunctional-family film. The result is an unstructured, messy narrative, but an extremely funny film.As always, the visual style of the cartoons looks brilliant and this truly jumps from small to big screen with aplomb. The voice performances are, as always, superb. However, the plot, such as it is, is not the driving force of the film. It is either servant to the jokes or the environmental parable. This could work for 21-minutes, as it does in the film, but after an hour and a half you're left quite entertained though slightly disappointed.For fans of the show, then, this is a treat of sorts. The writing is better here than it has been on the show for some years and that will appeal to all, though for those who are not Simpsons-literate, the film will ultimately leave you entertained if unsatisfied.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Well Worth the Wait!,"I got the chance to see this movie last night at a sneak preview showing and I have to say that it was hilarious. I haven't been too keen on the past couple of years' worth of TV episodes, thought maybe they were running out of steam finally. Turns out they were saving up all their good material for the movie!The movie is absolutely hilarious. I was almost in tears at points! I've been fairly lucky as I haven't seen the TV spot that everyone it seems has seen with the pig was a complete surprise to me and it was great!Way to go on this movie to everyone who worked on it!",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Doesn't disappoint,"The Simpsons Movie gives you exactly what you would want from a Simpsons movie. The story is interesting, each character has plenty of time to shine and there are suitable cameos for many of the extended cast.There are plenty of good jokes and some nice visual gags such as the naked skate boarding.If you think about it for two long there may be a few plot holes such as anyone from Springfield who was out of town when the dome went down. And anyone who has ever heard of Springfield not being alarmed by the plans for a new Grand Canyon.But that doesn't distract from what is a solid and enjoyable film and a nice chapter in the history of the Simpsons legacy.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Best Comedy of the Year,"Absolutely hilarious.Please ignore those old-fart comments about how the Simpsons aren't what they used to be. They saved their best jokes for this movie, and The Simpsons lived up to its name.I liked how the writers did not try to over-do it. They stayed within their realm of the ""TV"" feel and it worked beautifly. The plot wasn't too original; it was a basic simpson's plot where homer messes up and pisses off a lot of people only to gain a conscience and redeem himself But the jokes and humor within the plot are Grade A quality.Was it as good as the Simpsons were 10 years ago? Personally, I thought it was. You may not, but that's not the point. Remember that for those who didn't like this movie, they are comparing it against the already gold-standard of the Simpsons, which is extremely high. Against any other comedy movie out there, the Simpson's is a top-contender.My vote for Comedy of the Year!",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Longer is Better (Screen),"If this movie has been a family feud for me, it is above all a really fun cartoon.The TV show, close to its 20 years, had become quickly boring for me because of the effect of frozen time in Springfield, which makes every situation addressed.So as this new meeting occurs after a few years, and on big screen, new ideas arrive: the family getting out of the town, almost every characters has a part and if there is still parody or private jokes, I could also laugh at some silly moments!Finally, for me, it is one of a few shows that is better on screen than on TV!",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Great fun as the Simpsons transport form the TV to the big screen,"The Simpsons (the movie!) no need for introductions for the first family of TV, they are an institution in themselves and it is safe to say they will be as well known in 50 years time as they are now.The story is an elongated episode of one of the TV shows, with Homer getting the family into trouble and the whole town has to suffer the consequences from the national government. Jokes come fast and furious as you expect, and there is no way you can't but help but laugh out loud at many points to the antics of Homer Simpson. One major difference to the TV program is that the movie does have some more risqué jokes in it which will shock and amuse in equal measures.So the question is how will this film fit into the Simpsons' phenomenon? Firstly, I enjoyed it thoroughly, although is no classic, but fits in well with all that has come before. Strange, bewildering and as unbelievable as it always has been, and all the better for it. Could have used most of the support characters more. Mr Burns, the cops and all the others were hardly in it except bits and bobs which was a shame.Regardless, a good time for all and will definitely go down well with hardcore Simpsons aficionados.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Simpsons Movie does NOT disappoint!,"Personally I do not really think that the Simpsons has been going downhill in recent years, though I can accept points of views stating that it has. With many people discussing the decline in quality of the show over the past few years I even had my doubts as to how good (or more to the point, how great) the movie would actually be.It did not disappoint...far from it in fact. It by far exceeded my expectations, and my expectations were almost unreachable!! From the opening scene to the closing scene this film delivers what every Simpsons fan wants and what every Simpsons episode should deliver. With so many moments that will have you laughing for an assortment of reasons, this movie is an example of why the Simpsons has lasted so long, and could last for much longer! The film is suitable for all the family, with the little children having their own moments to laugh at, whilst not understanding some of the more adult jokes. There are a few moments/scenes which the show would not include in a TV-aired episode. These moments come as sometimes a shock but are ALL hilarious! The Simpsons Movie, whilst being side-splittingly funny from start to end, also has probably one of the most emotional scenes ever seen from our favourite yellow family.Homer's imagination, stupidity and golden heart are the essence of this amazingly beautifully crafted and hilarious film.Whether you are a Simpsons fan of years gone by, a current fan or someone who wants to know 'what the big deal' is - I highly recommend this movie! You will not be disappointed! My only possible criticism is that I would have liked it to be longer...but surely that is a compliment more than a criticism? 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
funny,"I absolutely loved this movie. It was hilarious. Though, the only thing I didn't really like about it was that it was really short. For The Simpsons Movie I thought because it's one of the funniest and longest running shows I've ever seen on t.v., that the movie itself would be 2 hrs or 2hr. 30 or something like that. But overall it definitely was worth the ticket. Bart Simpson, Homer, everyone. They were all classic. Comparing it to Family Guy, and I'm sure a lot of others may not agree with me on this but I personally feel, and again this is just me, that Simpsons is a wee bit funnier. Great job to the whole cast. 5 thumbs up to Nancy and the gang.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Welcome to Irrelevancy,"The announcement of the Simpsons movie was somewhat suspect for myself and probably a lot of other Simpsons fans... Will the movie throw back to the glory days or will it become more irrelevant and terrible like the newer series'. The answer sadly is the later. The Simpsons movie contains the same played out jokes, unfunny and ridiculous situations and none of the characters that originally made the show a success had even more than maybe a scene, if at all! It's sad to see that such a great show can degenerate into the garbage that it is today.

"The best movie of my life, the best movie of your life so far","If i had to write a review in two words they would be loved it. The movie mixes classic simpsons with newer simpsons so all types of fans can enjoy. Its got some of the funniest moments throughout the whole series probably the one i enjoyed the most was spider pig and i like men now but its hard to choose from the vast array of one liners. To be honest i never thought i could laugh at movie more then i laughed at borat but i found that film. I have to mention the plot i thought it was perfect there were so many side stories which made the main plot a lot more compelling and it was just fantastic and well thought out. So if your up for a hour and a half long episode of the simpsons, which is truly epic, funny, class and just reunites everything and one that was the simpsons go see this film.PS.

"Hilarious, Filled with Heart, and greatly Exceeds Expectations","The movie that is ""eighteen years in the making"" has finally arrived, but is The Simpsons Movie really as good as it looks? The definite answer is, I'm very happy to say, a loud YES! The Simpsons Movie is filled with all sorts of fun things that will thrill fans of the show to the bone. There are loads of in-jokes, movie references, and there is even a recorded song version of 'Spider-Pig', the tune Homer makes up for his new pig. Heck, even if you aren't a particular fan of the show or you feel that the quality of the show has dropped considerably in the last few seasons, there is nothing to worry about; The Simpsons Movie makes up for everything, including some of the shows faults (of which there really aren't that many anyways).Without giving too much away, Springfield is in crisis after a mishap with the lake causes the entire town to be covered in a huge solid (and strangely hard to break) glass dome. All sorts of things happen, including Bart starting to grow attached to Flanders, issues between Marge and Homer, a love interest for Lisa, a special moment for Maggie (if you stay during the credits), and many things too random to mention in a simple review.The madcap humor of the show translates perfectly to the big screen, and there are plenty of laugh-out-loud moments *most* of the entire family can enjoy (the movie IS rated PG-13, after all). Each member of the family has their moment to shine, and the large Simpsons cast also fits in perfectly in one way or another. No line goes wasted; there is always an intelligent one-liner or hilarious physical humor that everyone has grown to love from the show.What makes The Simpsons Movie so perfect, however, is its huge amount of heart. Behind all of the laughs, in-jokes, and intelligent product placement, this cartoon feature has loads of heart in some of the most unexpected places. The movie never takes itself to seriously, which is hard to find in some films these days. If anymore was said, the movie would certainly be spoiled.Overall, The Simpsons Movie was a very fun time at the movies, filled with so many laugh-out-loud moments that you are left pretty much breathless by the end. While the movie is pretty short, it never feels too short or long; it actually has great pacing and never outstays its welcome. One can only hope for a sequel that is half as funny or full of heart as this first Simpsons Movie is. At the moment, though, The Simpsons Movie is one of the best of its kind and gives animated films a good name, especially by pushing the envelope to a PG-13 rating. Not much more can be said, so just go see the movie already (I saw the midnight screening)! 9.5/10, or A+",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

A bad film for a failing series,"I thought this film was one of the worst attempts to cash in that i have ever watched.I was hoping they would do something good with this movie, but all it was comprised of was a few funny one-liners (the rest failing completely).I think that The Simpsons is a dying series, and should just give up now, to avoid embarrassing itself any further, and this movie is proof of it.If they wanted to make the movie work, they could have made a plot which was a lot more interesting than what they gave us, and use more complex humour: not just the jokes for the average American Idiot.I also despise this movie for bringing us 'Spider-Pig'.

this movie sucked!!!!!!,"This movie was so unbelievably bad I couldn't even watch it without thinking how much respect I had lost for the writers who I loved. That is until they wrote this garbage. Sure, there were some funny parts and I'm all about taking shots at religion, but the first ten minutes do not represent what this movie actually is. What this movie actually is is a desperate attempt at a fifth season show that turned out to be just another crappy new episode. this movie disappointed me for a reason that i am sure other fans are equally as disappointed. It didn't have the Simpson charm. This movie was made for any teenager who wants to go to the movies to get crappy humor you get from family guy(possibly the worst show of the generation)and to leave feeling satisfied. As a die hard fan of the show(which I can assure you i am) this movie did not hold a candle to the first ten years of the series. I'll go down the list of things that make the series great but for some unknown reason the writers kept out of the movie. 1.Principal Skinner. 2.dangerous Krusty merchandise. 3.gay jokes about smithers. 4.stories that actually came from the hearts of the writers. 5.homer getting drunk. 6.patty and Selma, and if homer screws up like he does in this movie, they are the two people who absolutely need to be there. 7.i am not 100% sure about this but i'm don't think homer even says mmmmm... followed by a food. The political commentary was so bad. i don't even know what point they were trying to get across. choosing the EPA as the villain was a huge srike-out for the writers. especially when the obvious choice to use sideshow bob was(for lack of a better word)OBVIOUS. it would have been so much more simpsonsy. the shots they took at the government were just directed at kids who hate the government but don't know why they hate the government. is it just me or was president schwartzegger just stupid? the shots at the government could have been way smarter if they just put George W. in the movie. or, to be loyal to the show, made it Rainer wolf castle. by putting in green day, Hillary Clinton, and an inconvenient truth parody, the timeless quality of the movie is destroyed. you can look at it and tell exactly when it was made, whereas the earlier episodes can be showed at any time and they would be as funny as they were at air-date. by putting in new characters that SUCKED like Lisa's boyfriend, and cargill, they needed to make room by taking out characters who make the show awesome. raunchy aspects like Bart's penis, homer's middle fingers and Otto smoking pot made the characters just not seem like themselves. by the way, Bart's subplot with Flanders was bull plop. it was just so NOT Bart. Marge's tape was so predictable. her and homer have been on this merry-go-round of lies so many times before, you know how its going to end, so why go through the charade over and over. ALSO, i'll have a hard time saying it but there was one word that made me so mad i wanted to rip my theater seat out of the ground and throw it at the wall.....sequel?",1.0,Anonymous,Animation
Best. Movie. Ever.,"Along with millions of other Simpsons fans, I was a bit worried when I first heard that the movie was being written. I was a little more at ease when I heard that it would be a collaboration of writers from all the seasons. It showed. The movie was amazing. I laughed out loud from the very beginning to the end of the credits. There were so many great quotable lines, I will no doubt have to see it again and again. Go see this movie as soon as possible if you're a Simpsons fan, you will not be disappointed. The only downside for the true fans is the abundance of fair-weather fans who will no doubt flock to the theater to claim that they've been fans all along and then complain that it wasn't that good. Ignore them, enjoy the movie.By the way, the person who said Ricky Gervais' episode was bad is in no way accurate. Gervais wrote one of the funnier episodes of that season - completely on target with a more subtle, British approach.

Simpsons fans rejoice, the movie is far from a letdown. It will leave you rolling in your seat with laughter with the rapid amount of hilarious jokes and gags. What makes this more than a bunch of Simpsons episodes strung together (besides the screen and sound format) is the depth of character explored and the focus of the story.

Horrendous,"I can remember so many episodes of The Simpsons that made me laugh. Just as many episodes were also thought-provoking. Others were just plain fun to watch. Still more episodes had a good moral to the story. I consider myself a Simpsons fan from seasons 1 through approximately 10 (1989-1999). After these seasons, I slowly stopped watching the series due to it not being funny anymore. The laughing, thought-provoking, fun to watch, good morals of The Simpsons I knew were all gone. What came in it's place was slap-stick, sexual and political humor, direct personal attacks upon celebrities and politicians (aka ad hominem) and a complete lack of morality.Come The Simpsons movie. When I first saw the movie poster at a theater, I was against seeing the movie. Then, when the movie did come out, my fiancé' convinced me to see it and I actually became a little excited about it hoping that some of the old Simpsons would be in the movie (at least a little bit of it, please!). Even with my low expectations, the movie was even lower. The humor mirrored the current style in the episodes, there were no hand-drawn animations, jokes from the seasons I enjoyed were redone but completely disgraced and I certainly wasn't having a good time. I tolerated it and I still enjoyed the air conditioning of the theater, but that's about it. There were a few parts of the movie that were... eh, OK, I guess...So, if you are a Simpson fan similar to me, then I would suggest that you not watch the movie. If you enjoy the current Simpsons, then this would be for you. I still don't understand why so many people enjoy this movie, all of the humor is so shallow. Oh well.",1.0,Anonymous,Animation

The creators have gone all out for this and I don't think i'll look at the show the same way again.

All of this add great laughs that you don't get on the show.I think the only bad thing about this movie is the fact that all the supporting characters of the show have very small roles in the film.

The Simpsons Movie: A Review,"After many, many years of the show being on television, the big screen was finally ready to embrace a yarn about The Simpsons. I've been a longtime fan since the show began, and waited for the day to come, patiently. I stuck with the show year after year, even when fan boys started to complain about later episodes. The show was as entertaining as ever, as far as I was concerned. I had good feelings about the movie when I heard about it, and I was completely satisfied with the result. ""The Simpsons Movie"" is surely as funny and as entertaining as I knew it would be.What I liked:There were no major changes or departures from the show, with the minor exception of some crude humor that wouldn't have flown on Fox, which didn't bother me. I enjoyed hearing the laughter of the audience as the jokes flew by.What I didn't like: It's unfair to say I didn't dislike anything about the movie, but I really had no problems. Most of the crap came from people online who had nothing but negative things to say about the film, and surely enough, if you weren't a fan of the show, you sure weren't going to change your mind now.

A must-see for any Simpsons fan,"What do you get when you have the 11 best writers in Simpsons history work together? Comedic gold.One of the biggest surprises to me was that The Simpsons Movie actually feels like a movie and not just four consecutive episodes. It contains one of the most ridiculous plots in the series' history and yet almost feels epic. It involves the Simpson family leaving Springfield. It also contains two mildly interesting subplots: Bart turning to Flanders as a father figure, and Lisa getting a boyfriend. I won't give away any more than that, cause I'd rather not ruin anything. The writing is great. No matter how bad Homer screws up, he still remains a lovable character who's impossible to hate (I also credit Dan Castellaneta for that, the voice actor for Homer).From the opening seconds until the ending credits, the movie is hilarious throughout. Just as funny as any season one through nine episode. The film is PACKED with one-liners, sight gags, movie references, and the occasional inside joke. My eyes were glued to the screen the entire time trying to pick up on as many as possible.I've always loved the voice acting in The Simpsons and thought it to be tremendous. But the actors go all out in the movie. Dan Castellaneta, Hank Azaria, Julie Kavner, and Harry Shearer were all excellent, but it was Yeardley Smith's (Lisa) acting that left be speechless.My only real problem with the movie was the length. 85 minutes is just not enough to do justice to one of the greatest comedy shows of all time. I would loved it to have been 10-15 minutes longer. And the lack of Mr. Burns was also slightly disappointing.Sure being a Simpsons geek I'm probably be slightly biased. If you dislike the show, you'll probably hate the movie. But if you're a fan of the show (like myself), you'll love the movie. It's laugh-out-loud funny, while still having a lot of heart. It's as simple as that.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Expectedly Predictable,"What started out as a revolutionary TV series has turned into just ""another show"". When the Simpsons first started, it was funny, new, and fresh. The producers continued along that path until the show reached its 15th or so season and the show lost most of its luster and shine. Jokes were bled dry and nothing new was added.Until, the producers decided to go the obvious route, to make a movie of the long-running show to try to revive its fanbase. Long story short: it was a failure. The show relied too heavily on the familiar, overused, and sometimes not even funny, jokes. But when in doubt, the producers had the characters throw in a phrase/quip/joke/comeback that was either yelled, involved swearing, or both.The main reason this movie was a bomb because everyone is used to the Simpsons being 30 minutes long. Since the movie was a little less than triple the length, it was about an hour too long.",2.0,Anonymous,Animation
Good Stuff,"Since I heard about the movie being released, I knew it would be pure gold. The writers can still deliver good material, even though the quality has decreased since season 11 or so, and the series is know almost vitually unwatchable.This is season 9 material here, folks, I kid you not. It had that good feeling and comedy we get from the best episodes. Albert Brooks as a main character is a treat, he's the best voice guest and deserves to be there.The animation is top notch, but gets a bit distracting some times (CGI cell shading scenes a la Futurama).Sure, there are a few problems: the movie feels a bit too short, few characters get screen time (Ralph got way too many scenes, and a lot of beloved characters did not even appear), and some subplots feel rushed and go nowhere (kinda like the TV series I guess). The DVD will have LOTS of cut material, so that might get fixed on a subsequent viewing.If you are a fan of the Simpsons, specially the 8-10 seasons, THIS is the movie to see this year.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Worth the wait.....,"Like the Hippocratic Oath which says doctors should ""first do no harm"", I was just concerned that ""The Simpsons Movie"" not de-value the legendary Simpsons brand. It not only didn't hurt the brand, it was worth the wait. As, sadly, a grown-up who was 14 when the show started, it boggled my mind seeing Homer 15 feet tall (or whatever it is) on the big-screen. I haven't been excited about an ""event"" movie for some time but as a long time Simpsons fan, I've been excited about this for six or seven months or whenever I knew it would be here this summer. The first half hour was riotous. Lots of hysterical, sharp, witty one-liners. It was cool seeing a bit of profanity, some humor which would not be cleared for the 1/2 hour every Sunday. I really don't want to post a detailed summary of what I saw and enjoyed, suffice it to say that I think the writers captured the rhythm of humor which is necessitated by a plot which has been extended from a half-hour base. The humor satisfied everyone. The kids loved the broad, physical, visual humor while of course the additional levels of humor which make the Simpsons such a widely respected institution on television, along with the pratfalls and the visual comedy, kept the older teens and adults laughing. I think finding fault with this movie is really an exercise in pettiness. I don't know how such a legendary program could have been better adapted for the big-screen.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Very very funny,"I've been a fan of the show since the first season so I had been waiting on this movie for a long time. To me, The Simpsons is the single best show of all time.

Today, The Simpsons is still funny, but episodes that make me laugh as hard as I did during those first ten seasons come around only once in a while.Fortunately, this movie is one of those episodes. I laughed pretty much the whole way through it, and I laughed hard. As you can tell, I went to the movie expecting to like it. And even with high expectations, The Simpsons Movie still impressed me. The last movie that made me laugh so much and so hard was Borat. I can't wait to see it again.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Wooooo--Hoooooo ! I loved it !!!,"This is one of the funniest laugh out loud movies I've seen in a long long time.And I was relieved that my much beloved TV show didn't produce a bomb at the box office.I have watched The Simpsons since the beginning and I was afraid this movie would bomb and kill the series.Far from it.In the movie Homer is up to his usual shortcuts and laziness and after he pollutes the Springfield Lake so bad that the EPA takes over the town The Simpsons become fugitives running from the irate townspeople and the government.If you've watched and loved the TV show you will love this movie.There is nothing much different in the movie than the TV show ,other than vulgarities and nudity and obscene gestures,but other than that it is pretty much the same.That's right this movie has nudity.Take that Jerry Falwell.Now I've seen some reviewers say this movie is like the later day Simpsons show,good but not as great as the early years but I'm not sure I agree with that.It's true that The Simpsons TV show has declined a bit in the last 5 seasons but it is still the funniest thing on TV.This movie was better,I felt,than many recent episodes of the show.So my opinion is that this movie is indeed a closer relative to The Simpson's glory days than the current crop of shows.But anyway the movie is laugh out loud funny and I'm not that easy to make laugh out loud.If you like the TV show you'll like this movie and if you're one of the 3 people never to have seen the TV show I'll bet you too will like this movie.I'm ready to see the movie again and will want to buy a copy for the DVD bonuses and all the hidden stuff in the movie I missed at the theater.Here's to Matt Groening and all the Simpsons cast members-----thanks for a great movie and a great TV show and may Homer continue to f*** up for many years to come.And since you guys made a crap-load of money off the movie I'm sure we'll see a Part 2 very shortly.Woooo-Hoooo.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Utterly Hilarious,"I went into this film with the same skepticism as everyone else. Don't get me wrong, I love the Simpsons, but the show, as like any other would, has lost some steam throughout it's many years. So, obviously I as many others were wondering how would they pull of a feature film. Now, all I can say is WoW! This movie comes at you like a freight train. Yes, we did have a good fan crowd which always helps, but I did not see this one coming. I thought it would have random funny parts, but this was just wall to wall hilarity. I haven't laughed this hard in a long time. It's easily up there with knocked up as the funniest film this year, although it is two totally different kinds of humor.The plot goes as this; Springfield's lake is being polluted by it's citizens and Lisa finally gets the message to the town so they clean it up. Unfortunately, Homer steps in and screws everything up, so Springfield is locked in a dome by the environmental protection agency. The townspeople come after Homer, The Simpsons escape, town gets threatened to be destroyed, simpsons return to save the day.I'm not going to throw in the spoilers. This movie is utterly hilarious and only slightly lets up in the third act, which is saying a lot for comedies these days. The jokes fly fast that you find yourself laughing through most of the dialogue, and they are up to date and genuinely funny.I didn't expect this movie to be this good and put it on my top ten for the year. Please see this, I don't see how you could be disappointed. Thanks to all involved for making this one of the best times I've had at the movies in quite a while.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
hmm pretty bad even for The Simpsons,"I wasn't thrilled when I heard about a Simpson's movie, I knew this would either boost the quality or drastically drop it, as the show seems to be be in recent years (with exception to Halloween episodes). The lead characters seemed out of personality (Homer being a complete selfish Pratt) except Lisa being her usual preachy self. Greendays inclusion seemed pointless, just trying to fit another gag in. granted there were somethings that made me slightly giggle but those were things that weren't even funny, the plot device of the bike-cage thing for the final act was a bit disappointed.Animation was a bit weird as the cel-shaded items in the film looked odd especially the Simpson's car looking out of proportion.To wrap this up: poor script, poor character development, poor plot, poor humour.This film shows that the Simpson's stands more simpletons",1.0,Anonymous,Animation
A Long Wait and damn was it worth it.,"I have had my extreme doubts about this movie what with the series losing the quality we had come to expect from it in recent years but this movie truly comes back to the glory days of the Simpsons and more.My first ideas when I saw the teaser was, Oh no, A Simpson's movie..It is going to be exactly like the series has become now, tiresome and forced jokes but no!I won't give away any of the plot which is basic yet manages to captivate you all the same with excellent use of almost every character in Springfield. Except for a few that I'm sure some have complaints about didn't get enough screen time but just remember it's a Simpsons Movie not a Springfield town and all it's residents movie.Basically Homer screws over the whole town and it's up to him to fix this and it never gets boring.The jokes keep coming and the beginning is almost exactly like an episode but it really starts to pick up the pace from about 20 minutes away and manages to come up with a story better then aliens invading or end of the world/apocalypse I always expected it to be. One thing though, I did miss Kang and Kodos though.But not to give away the story, it has an excellent reference to one of the best Simpsons ever. Just remember, jumping the gorge and the ambulance is still there!Overall the movie has excellent jokes and really managed to impress me and I really didn't expect it to be much more then a shoddy attempt but there we go.And special mention out to Spider Pig! Which manages to do even more then in all the TV adverts and trailer and still make us laugh our heads off!Simpsons Movie, well worth a watch.In fact, go watch it right now! You will love it and that's a promise.9/10",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Good stuff,"After many many years of waiting one of the worlds oldest animated families finally comes to the big screen. After an incredible number of episodes on the little screen it is hard to come with something good enough to feed a movie theaters audience for the length of a full size film, but, it can be said, this one does the trick.It all starts as Homer gets a pet pig and collects the pigs feces in a silo that he then flushes on a small lake. This small lake had been the victim of lots of pollution already and the silo is the proverbial drop that spills the bucket. And when the bucket spills it is time for drastic measures.As the story starts there is plenty of room for the little jokes we have learned to expect from The Simpsons series and there is more than enough room for the continuation of a story line that makes this film into a combination of two or three episodes of the series. It doesn't get better than a combination of episodes but I don't think that could even be expected from a series running as long as this one.There are a some small cameos by actors and other celebrities and all in all it is very true to the series and very enjoyable.One small hint: take the time to sit through the ending credits.9 out of 10 french fries covering up things",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Homer bungles again!,"We saw this movie on opening day and found it absolutely hilarious!!! It has all the characteristics of a Simpson's episode but with much more activity in every scene. There are so many sight gags that the movie will require several viewings to catch everything. It comes as no surprise that Homer is once again a bungling fool, but the consequences this time are more drastic and potentially catastrophic then ever before (and that's saying a lot).The movie moves along at such a fast pace that even though it's about two hours in length, it seemed like it was over way too quickly. I highly recommend seeing this movie and then seeing it again!",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
The Simpsons is not all about laughing,"I found the film interesting in how Bart showed a different attitude from what we know of this character, he plays a more mature role, although he doesn't lose his essence. The scene at night on the tree was pretty moving for me. I thought I would see a more humorous Homer, also, but I think he felt forced by the story writers to accomplish a primary role without letting him improvise. The animation was nothing to do with that famous 2-D motto that was used to promote the film. But what I sense the most serious failure of this film wasn't the film itself, but the extremely overcast trailers FOX made, at a point that along most of the time of playing you could recognize them, not letting the spectator to imagine and enjoy the film with a sense of surprise and astonishment. That spoiled the story more than any other thing.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Irresistibly hilarious!,"Irresistibly hilarious! It's awesome how The Simpsons can still manage to make us seriously laugh after all these years, in its trademark brand of wit and self-deprecating humor.Despite having already seen some funny vignettes in the trailers, they are still funny when seen again in the movie (in 2-D! as Moe proudly says), and it's a big relief that there's actually more of those in the full-length movie. Another brilliant thing about The Simpsons: each character, no matter how small a role, is memorable and likable.The lead characters, especially, manage to make you care about them no matter how radically different their personalities are: Homer, the dimwitted husband to Marge, the ever-forgiving and perfect wife and mother to Bart, the wise-ass troublemaker; Lisa, the idealistic wunderchild; and the quietly intriguing baby Maggie. Then of course the slew of other characters that would be impossible not to name (as they had in the trailer): Flanders, Santa's Little Helper, Otto, Apu, Mr. Burns and Smithers...Stay till the end to hear Maggie say her first word!",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
HAHA I Loved It!!,"Now the last few seasons of The Simpsons haven't been top notch but this movie was really funny, I believe a lot of people had too high of expectations the basic storyline is Lisa is trying to clean up Springfield but when homer messes that up Springfield is covered because they are the most polluted town in America throughout the movie homer learns about the importance of family. However this movie is very enjoyable if your a Simpson's fan. It is fairly short so I do not recommend spending ten dollars on snacks but overall with homer and Bart having the dare challenge at the beginning and is fairly funny all the way through I recommend checking this movie out. Thanks for your time!! Check this movie out if you are a Simpson's fan!!!! I'M OUT!!!",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
A really disappointing let down,"Unfortunately the Simpsons movie fails in its attempt to translate to the big screen. This is both surprising and disappointing as whereas shows like south park have more and more pulled in ratings by pushing the boundaries of bad taste, the Simpsons even though has included more adult humour as of late has always primarily relied on excellent set pieces and a fantastic and varied supporting cast.The last of these points illustrates one of the main failings of this movie, the cast of supporting characters are given less screen time than in a normal Simpsons episode which makes the movie feel like there is something lacking. The story is also wildly implausible even by the Simpsons standards and also feels void of any real substance, most Simpsons episodes involve a small scale situation which sometimes but not always progresses to a larger scale with the humour revolving around the Simpsons handling of the situation, not giving too much away but the progression of events feels rushed and with the talent of the writers you feel they could have thought of something better .Unfortunately as with many movies that I have personally seen lately most of the best bits of the film are in the trailer. Everyone in the cinema was obviously looking forward to the arrival of spider pig but apart from what you see of him in the trailer he is discarded very quickly which left many people confused. The jokes are also hit and miss some of them actually made people in the cinema groan, this was again a disappointment as the Simpsons is known for laugh out loud moments. The movie also rehashes at least one story line which has been covered several times in the various seasons of the Simpsons, this either feels like laziness on the part of the writers or an attempt to include a storyline which they know has kept viewers attentions for several years and will help as the producers of the movie said to introduce the movie to those people who had not watched the Simpsons before. This being said it still feels that the writers could have thought up a fresh idea for both fans and newcomers alike. As some people who have watched the film will know there is one moment of nudity that while drawn was none the less more shocking than funny and from the reactions in the cinema it was ill advised, parents were tutting, some children were laughing heartily but some stared at the screen not really sure what reaction they should have, this moment was in total contrast to events at the beginning of the movie where an itchy and scratchy cartoon has been toned down, this made the film feel a bit of a mess.In conclusion the Simpsons movie suffers from a lack of what the show is all about, a superb support cast, simple yet effective comedy and a story that while not totally unbelievable doesn't leave you scratching your head as to what the hell is going on. This movie is the most disappointing film I have seen in a while which is a great shame.",4.0,Anonymous,Animation
The Simpsons Movie Review,"Ever since their own television show in 1989 after a little program called ""The Tracey Ullman Show"" introduced our favorite family in one minute skits, they finally have a movie of their own where it's pure delight from minute one of Homer and the family watching Itchy and Scratchy before the paterfamilias tells the citizens of Springfield that they are better off waiting for the movie on cable than pay to see it at a movie theater. That's Homer right there, folks! ""The Simpsons Movie"" has every character you love from the sinister Mr. Burns and his ""sissy"" assistant Waylon Smithers, to the drunken Barney Gumble, the goody-goody Flanders, the funny Jewish clown Krusty the Klown and more where the premise of the first length feature of the popular show involves a chemical in the lake where after the mayor of Springfield hears Lisa out on helping the environment, they block the lake with barricades and a fake wall to keep the water clean. Does everybody listen? By now you would've figured that Homer wouldn't while enjoying his lovable pet pig he saved from being slaughtered as he ruins the lake with crap the pig made not before being contained by a crazed EPA (Environmental Protection Agency) member by the name of Russ Cargill (the funny Albert Brooks) where it's up to Homer and the Simpsons to save the day along with the citizens of Springfield.This isn't the first feature length film from animation to be released to the big screen where back in 1999 we had South Park: Bigger, Longer and Uncut where just like the Comedy Central hit, it stayed true to its roots in being dirty and vulgar to make people laugh just like the show. The Simpsons Movie stays true to its reputation for being funny along with the fact that there's no stopping Homer or Bart's shenanigans.The film is under 90 minutes where it's just fun.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Very funny and true to the series,"If you love The Simpsons, then the movie will not disappoint you! Watch as the Simpsons family gets themselves into even more of a pickle than ever before. This movie is witty, hilarious and has lots of unexpected twists and turns as it progresses. It is well worth a watch, no matter what age you are or whether you've seen much of The Simpsons series before.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
