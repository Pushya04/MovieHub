I don't get why people over hate this movie,"Just as the title says, I truly dont understand why people hate this movie a lot, I think its fine and still really entertaining. Yes, from the 3 movies up to this point this one is the weakest, but that doesnt mean its bad. Yes, there are some moments in the story that feel weird, there are actually some plotpoints that are never adressed, it parodies itself a little bit too much, and etc. But the action is still pretty cool, the story while having its bunch of mistakes, its still very entertaining. I do hope more people appreciate it with the time.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"A good, but flawed, attempt at continuing James Cameron's legacy.","Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines is often criticized by fans as being not in the same tone as its predecessors. While I agree with that statement in many ways, I think Jonathan Mostow made an honest effort to bookend the series.Storyline: The story is probably one of the things I take issue with most. It brings up new questions on the nature of time travel within the Terminator universe, as well as bringing new plot holes (something the previous films also had). Some of these flubs could've been corrected with a little research, but I digress.The story tends to be a retread of Terminator 2, which hurts it a lot. But Mostow tries to draw attention away from this with some awesome action sequences. The storyline, in this respect, takes it up a notch with scenes such as the restroom fight and crane scene.Acting: I think the acting is one of the best things in this film. Mostow did an excellent job in casting. Rather than going for actors known for their work in action films, the director instead used performers known for their talent in dramatic roles. Nick Stahl and Claire Danes both portray their characters with depth and humanity. Stahl does an especially good role in showing the paranoia and uncertainty of the future.And, as always, Arnold Schwarzenegger does a great job as the Terminator. His lack of social interaction provides many humorous moments throughout the film, while also giving him a drill instructor approach when dealing with the John Connor character.Lastly, there is Kristanna Loken as the T-X. While not as intimidating as the T-1000, I didn't expect this to be the case. Robert Patrick played a character with no face and every face, which can only work once if at all. That being said, Loken does a decent job in the role, providing a very cold performance for an equally cold character.Visual/Special Effects: The visuals of Terminator 3 are pretty good. The liquid metal effects are still as great as they were in 1991 along with some of the CG animated endoskeletons in the Future War sequence.My only qualms with the visuals is that there is a lack of blue tint that was prevalent in James Cameron's previous films, but this is more a matter of taste than anything.Musical Score: Brad Fiedel's dark and mechanical theme is absent from the film until the credits arrive, which is something that bothered me. Not only that, but T3's rendition of the theme isn't as powerful as it is in its predecessors.However, Marco Beltrami does manage to increase the tension of scenes with his score, though little else. This aspect, like the storyline, could of been improved.Conclusion: Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines wasn't a necessary sequel, but a decent one. I don't believe this installment ruined the series as much as, say, Alien^3. This film will no doubt continue to be one that either fans love or hate.I happen to love it.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Unwanted parody of two of cinemas finest action films,"No matter what people say Terminator 3 was a turkey.The tone was wrong and bad decisions were made in the casting and character phase of the film.Sarah Conner is feebly written out of this story and the film suffers badly for missing her presence.There is also too much self referential parody,there are times when Arnie is made to look silly through the use of badly timed and misjudged comedy moments.I partly blame Jonathan Mostow,he held the reigns on this one and would have had a big say in how it all played out.I couldn't believe they went as far to copy the scene in T2 when Arnie gets his leathers in the bar only this time he gets them from a gay bar and ends up wearing 70's style plastic Elton John style glitz glasses instead of his iconic shades.This was embarrassing.Ed Furlong is replaced by the inferior Nick Stahl and Clare Danes is just filler. The Terminatrix doesn't really come off although Kristianna Loken tries her best.In all this is a hugely disappointing experience for people that have followed Terminator films so far.It has some great standalone action sequences but as a whole is a lazy retread that indulges parody and comedy far too much divorcing itself from the serious tone set by the previous two films.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Terminator returns,"This film shouldn't have been made, simple. I loved the Terminator franchise, but losing James Cameron wasn't a good thing. Terminator 3 lacks a visionary filmmaker and they include many needless jokes and winks to the fans. Schwarzenegger returns and saves what could've been an absolute mess without him. The film has some action packed moments, but it lacks the pacing of the first 2 films. It's not a mess, but it's not great either. Like all needless sequels, they attempt nostalgia to appease the core fans, and that is not what we want.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Not perfect but it is what a summer blockbuster should be  a big loud enjoyable film,"In 2003 John Connor is living a life without record, with no fixed address, no bank account and no permanent job.  He does this to avoid the terminators of the future being able to find him and kill him.  In absence of him, Skynet sends back a T-X to kill secondary targets  Connor's future lieutenants, among them Kate Brewster, daughter of military scientist Robert Brewster.  Luckily, in the future, Kate has sent back a captured Terminator to protect them.  As the group escape Connor learns more of judgement day and sets out to try and stop it again.T3 is different from T2 in that it isn't really in the same league (IMO) as T2 was when it came out.  In my view T2 was the must see movie of it's time whereas now it has faded a little and is secondary to the matrix and other cutting edge blockbusters.  In fact so second was it that I wasn't that bothered about seeing it or not.  However I'm glad it did as T3 is nicely paced, doesn't expect too much of itself and does just what a blockbuster is meant to be  be entertaining.The plot is mostly secondary to the action but, basically, the T-X has been sent back to take out a group of people before it then (accidentally) finds it's primary target of John Connor.  Some of the plot is a little tenuous but it doesn't matter as it moves along at such a pace that you don't have time to really think too long about any one scene.  However the climax is a hark back to the original Terminator with a down deep and depressing ending where fate manages to happen regardless of Connor's best intentions.The action is great although it does look basic beside the effects of Matrix etc.  I did feel that they worked better by not trying to be overly flashy or fancy.  The morphing effects are actually more enjoyable because here they make up part of the action whereas in T2 they were key moments of cutting edge technology.  The film's action takes the form of a simple chase and is very effective, the multiple car chase is my favourite scene  partly because it shows how very out classed the Terminator is by the new model!The direction is good and Cameron isn't missed at all.  Mostow does a great job with the action scenes and keeps everything just perfect. Because the film realises that the franchise is build on catch phrases and images that have entered into popular culture so much that they are overused, it wisely chooses to mock itself and has a real nice sense of humour to it.  For example the original Terminator had the terminator entering a motor cycle bar and exiting dressed in biker leathers, here he enters a bar and finds a ladies night in full swing and has to get his clothes from a gay stripper. The deadpan way in which he rejects the sunglasses is really good.  In a way this could have undermined the effect of the film but it is managed well and doesn't.The cast is roundly good.  The exit of Sarah Connor is handled well and her replacement (Danes) is good despite a few duff lines which don't convince. Stahl's performance could be seen as mocking Furlong's drug problems (I can't see any other reason for his junkie-like tics etc.) but he is still good and carries the film well.  Schwarzenegger wisely agrees to mock his own character  the film takes the idea that time has passed the Terminator franchise by, by having the terminator itself being totally superseded. Loken is good as the T-X and is sexy enough but isn't given as much to do as anyone else.  Whereas Patrick was pretty much the main focus of T2 (because of the effects) Loken has less of an impact.Overall I had my doubts about this film but it did manage to do just what I needed it to do.  The action is overblown and enjoyable without being the cutting edge in special effects at any time.  The plot-driving scenes are good and the main story (behind the action) is involving and interesting, right up till the downbeat ending.  I must say that, although it is hardly the most imaginative or inspiring film made this year, it certainly does what you need a blockbuster to do  no deep, pretentious plots, no joy-less acting, but rather a big noisy movie that doesn't take itself too serious (despite the serious plot) and is actually very enjoyable to watch.  Nor a great film but I really wish that more blockbusters were like this.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Really underrated.,"I feel this movie gets a lot more hate than it deserves. Sure it may not be as good as the second one, and let's face it it's hard to top T2. But that doesn't make this a bad film. I actually like how John Connor is portrayed in this. Sure he's a bit whiny and a bit of a coward, but that's because he has not grown yet into the person he will be. He's unsure, and full of doubt. He has to grow.And this movie has one of the best movie trailers I've ever seen!",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"The more I think about this movie, the more it grows on me.","I didn't go to see this movie with very high expectations, because it has gotten such varied and sometimes disparaging reviews this forum.  However, since I am an aspiring screenwriter and true cinema fan rather than simply a moviegoer, I decided to give this movie the benefit of the doubt.  At the very least, I could end up writing a scathing attack on it.Instead, I have found that I enjoyed the movie as I watched it, saw some flaws, but have discovered that the more I think about it, the more I want to give it a higher rating than I initially did (7).  The film's two major dramatic flaws, in my opinion, are: (1) An over-the-top chase scene that comes way too early in the script without sufficient build-up in suspense leading up to it; (2) A little too much campy humor recycled from the first two Terminator movies.The good outweighs the bad by a large margin. (1) The screenplay has some intriguing plot subtleties that grow on me after awhile, the most notable of which is the actual nature of the safe place.  It could be the way it is for several possible reasons, some strategically favoring SkyNet, some the humans.  Any of them could be spun into a major plot element for a sequel. The rest you'll just have to find yourself. (2) The character development of both John Connor and Kate Brewster is elegant, believable and moving, and also opens possibilities for future character development. (3) The plot is an interesting variation of the ""Reluctant Hero"" theme, which is a classic in literature and drama and always will be.  John Connor is a hero who is almost an anti-hero.  True, they could have sharpened his ambivalence a little (sacrificing some chase footage for it would have been an excellent trade, in my opinion). (4) The Terminatrix is a very good villain: She's young, she's sexy, and she's chillingly soulless.  She is actually too smoothly sexy and physically perfect, but that makes sense when you consider that she has been created and programmed by other machines who, lacking the real-world experience of humans, can only base her appearance and humanoid behavior on their knowledge of human stereotypes.That last leads me to some thoughts about Arnie's character.  He is clearly getting a little too old for a reprise of his customary youthful, physically perfect role in any sequel.  If he is brought back in a sequel - and I hope he is - a good, imaginative screenwriter could really work with his advancing age and loss of physical perfection.  Since he is programmed by humans with real human experience, he could be brought back as a deceptively older and less physically powerful character, but more psychologically sophisticated (more like a true human with a soul), and his deceptive physical appearance combined with his greater psychological sophistication could be his aces in the hole when his strength and nonhuman cyborg qualities are insufficient.  In other words, he could be shaped into an amazing supporting hero in any sequel. Maybe I could write his role!",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Grossly underrated,"While this film is clearly not as great as its predecessor, I think it has a lot of merits. The way I see it, It's the most underrated Terminator movie. I like how the story connects with the previous movies and the how it tries to expand the Terminator universe. The characters themselves are compelling and the action is bigger, thrilling and almost on par with the previous movies. The acting department is also excellent with Arnold swarzenneger stealing the show once again. The villain is improved and also chilling. Overall, this film starts out really promising, holding your attention, it did begin to begin muddled in the somewhere in the last act, but that doesn't take away from the action and good characters.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Who cares!,"Have just returned after a triple show of T1 + T2 + T3. An excellent way in which to spend a rainy day!Before the films my three friends and I were looking very much forward to re-see T1 + T2 on a big screen. As for T3 we didn't expect too much.While the copies of T1 + T2 were slightly dated, to say the least, both films were absolutely superb, also despite the fact that the effects in T1 were quite primitive compared to today. Nevertheless, T1 remained our favorite not the least because of its very stringent and no-nonsense non-moralistic narrative. T2 was also strong in this aspect, though there were slightly more plot holes and a little too much sentimentality, something which unfortunately plagues many American films. Nonetheless T2 is also great.Then came T3 ... well, a film taste is very individual. Therefore you, dear reader, should not be deterred from going to see this film, despite the fact that my three friends and I all couldn't care less about it.Why didn't we like it? Well, surprisingly we were all in agreement about the lack-of-Cameron-touch as one of the worst failings of the film. The new director does not have the ability to time scenes, events, statement and the narrative anywhere near the brilliant level of Cameron.Therefore the new director tries to make up for this deficiency in making the car chases and the explosions bigger, the new enemy T-X more deadly, and destruction more extreme. But it all lacks energy, soul and credibility. The narrative is messy and coincidental, as if the director thinks ""now it will be nice to have this scene from a previous Terminator film included and just beefed up"" or ""let's try this - it might be funny"".This unfortunately lets the actors down, leaving them with empty hulls and we couldn't care less if they die or live. This, incidentally, is comparable to the Matrix II and the new Star Wars films. The director believes that he has a good film if he/she can include some cool effects. Doesn't work, though!Furthermore, the scenes lack anything that might even remotely draw the audience into the film. While you can feel the anguish of the humans and the one-mindedness of the robots in the earlier films, this piece of junk left my friends and I with the feeling of ""who cares!""The first and second Hellraiser movies were absolutely splendid. However, what followed should not ever be mentioned anywhere - especially number three sucked big time and should never bee seen by anybody. Terminator 3 is not so bad that it shouldn't be seen, though. However, it is highly advisable that you lower any expectations - and the lower them again. Then you might enjoy this film. Alternatively wait for the cheap version of the DVD.Finally, if the studio really wants to make a T4, which is highly suggested in T3, then they better get Cameron back on the job. Otherwise they will have just another silly action flick, with no real innovation or originality on their hands, like a gazillion other action flicks from Hollywood - because this is what they have with T3. So unless they rediscover the respect they owe to the great old Terminator-films : Who cares!",4.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Good Conclusion to the Saga,"I think this movie is a little underrated. Is it as good as T2? No, definitely not. But what film really is? With that out of way I'd say the third installment of the series is still a good action movie and unlike it's successors further down the line stays true to its heritage.The one thing which this film does better than T2 is the ending in my opinion. Did you really think the destruction of one computer lab would prevent humanity from developing AI forever? This wasn't really all that believable, time paradoxes not even factored in. T3 brings everything much more to full circle which I appreciate. Also I admit that I do have a soft spot for a hot terminatrix clad in red leather.It's a shame how the franchise went downhill after this, though. With Salvation being a completely disconnected but still somewhat okay action movie, Genesys a half backed and ultimately failed attempt at a soft reboot and Dark Fate an other reboot attempt that is outright insulting to the fans.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Why the Hate?,"I truly don't get the hate for this movie, unless you're one of those types that goes to comicon and asks questions about insanely obscure trivia to flaunt your vast knowledge of the T universe or writes erotic terminator fan-fiction from your mom's basement.It's the least of the three terminators, yes. But the least in a series of such high quality and entertainment value that to suggest this is one of the worst sequels ever is just plain hyperbolic stupidity. One of the things I keep seeing mentioned is the less serious parts. What is wrong with some humor? It was hardly even close to enough to call it a comedy and none of it was bad enough to induce groans. T2, and even T1, had humorous bits but I don't hear complaints about them. I don't know what people were expecting. They act like this is the Phantom Menace of the Terminator franchise.

"Good, and respectful of the originals","I liked this movie. It maybe isn't at the level of the first two, but it is decent enough, and respectful of the originals.The biggest plus of the movie, is what lot of people call it a minus: the fact that it reverses the ""happy end"" of T2. Sorry, but this is not ""disrespect to the Terminator canon"". On the contrary, it is respect to the original T1 story: Judgement Day is inevitable, one way or another. (Or at least the danger of it.) But we keep fighting. This is the main idea of the Terminator mythos, and it's good that T3 restores it, as it should always be.The biggest minus of the movie is something else: the character of John Connor, which, in the contrary with T2 movie (where he was an adventurous, clever and ""noughty"" (in a good way) boy we loved), here appears something of a crybaby young man, though at last seems he finds his way and destiny. And of course we miss our beloved Sarah Connor.On the contrary, the terminatrix Kristanna Lokken is superb at her role (though the Terminator model evolution, T-X, has reached an absurd level, as if liquid medal wasn't enough already). She has that cold look, and also expresses the ""female power"" thing. Her one-vs-one battles with good old Arnie are the best action moments of the movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Pretty awful.,"Judged on its own merits, this movie is as forgettable as a thousand other forgettable action flicks: They come, stick around for a few weeks and they're gone. Who cares. However, judged in relation to T1 and T2, this movie is especially bad.Here are a few of the things that bugged me: Whereas the earlier movies were thought provoking, this was just action for the sake of action. Even as such it wasn't all that good. T1 and T2 had elements of real heroism in them. Here we have no one to look up to. It amazes me that even though this movie was made much more recently, aided by the latest digital technology, it just didn't look as good as either of the previous two: They had a certain realism about them (keeping in mind that these are fantasy movies) whereas T3, at times, had more of a comic book movie look, reminding me at certain points of Batman or Darkman. The early fight scene outside the animal clinic looked particularly bad, as if it were done on a soundstage (probably was). The acting wasn't very good. I felt kind of bad for Claire Danes whom otherwise I like. I agree with some of the other reviews, John Connor was rather irritatingly wimpy. Arnold looked a little too old and the sunglasses gag was wrong for the movie. TX did nothing for me. The design detail was not nearly as good as T2.And so on. 2/10.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"The beginning of the decline of the Terminator films, but not as bad as reputed and better than the succeeding two films","The first Terminator is among the best of its genre, and Terminator 2 is bigger, richer and every bit as fantastic a film, one of the few sequels to be as great as its predecessor (Aliens, Godfather Part 2 and the Toy Story sequels are also noteworthy in this regard). Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines is certainly better than the two films following it and it is not that bad a film, but it is nowhere near as good as the first two.It is a bit unbalanced, with some misplaced and clumsily written comic relief that really does jars and there's far too much of it, and while the story is cohesive at least it is too more of the same, with in the first half not having anywhere near enough of the suspense and dark atmosphere (pretty predictable in fact), and some of the monologues ramble on too much, a few almost endless.Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines is a visually well-made film with a nice atmosphere with an appropriate darkness to it, it is slickly shot and edited and the special effects while not as stunning as the ones in Terminator 2 are solidly constructed. Jonathan Mostow is no James Cameron, but he does direct competently. There is a pulsating music score that has the right amount of energy and mysterious atmosphere while being too obvious, and while the script is uneven and not expansive enough with the characterisation it at least doesn't sound stilted and doesn't become so stupid that you're bashing your head repeatedly on a wall. Terminator's one liners are as wry as ever.Regarding the action, it is still thrilling and expensive in look with some high-octane chases and well-choreographed action. While the first half drags and is not very well-written, the story really picks up and becomes more diverting with much more of the dark atmosphere as seen before. The cast are good, with Arnold Schwarzenegger coming off best in the title role, imposing, badness and sometimes amusing, while Kristanna Loken is surprisingly and suitably y poised. Claire Danes does a good job with a not so interesting character, and while Nick Stahl underwhelms sometimes , being a little stiff and dull to start with, he is a decent fit and improves dramatically as the film gets better.All in all, not that bad but vastly inferior in quality to the first two films. 6.5/10 Bethany Cox",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Overall a let down,"When I first saw the trailer for T3 I must admit I was excited, judging by the special effects and the action scenes I thought that this would be a good addition to the series.However after watching the film I must admit I felt overall let down, the film just like Arnie felt old. Majority of the action scenes were good but the film just lacked something, when compared to T2. Even though T2 was made many years earlier the special effects still looked better then this film (except the one scene with Arnie at the end), and also it lacked the darkness, and suspense of the previous films I felt one of the biggest criticism of the film was that the t101 was completely out classed by the new terminator and so you really felt that in every action scene they were going to loose. At least in T2 you felt Arnie had a chance but there was never that feeling in this film. I do realise to some people this might be stupid but the confrontation between the new terminator and Arnie just felt wrong because we all knew Arnie was going to have his a** kicked Also even though Arnie had worked out to get into shape for this film he still looked to clunky and slow (if you can understand that) and I think that made the film less enjoyable overall. You never really felt that Arnie was a terminator just a out dated machine, in T2 Arnie looked (excuse the expression) cool, the scene where he was on the motorbike shooting at the T1000 was awesome but there were no such scenes in this film.Having a female as the terminator was also wrong, it did not feel right in this film There was also to much humour in this film (probably to give the 12a rating) and that was completely unnecessary, who on earth thought that putting Arnie in purple star shaped sunglasses was a good idea!!!!!!!!!! This really did ruin the film because you could never take Arnie seriously after that John Conner was poor as well, in T2 he showed courage and leadership but here he just looked like a wimp you never really believed that this person could be the saviour of humanity, I don't believe this was the actors fault more the direction of the film that made him into this charhachter I do realise I have criticised this film considerably but it's just after seeing T2 and how awesome that was this film did not even come close, however as a stand alone film it is good but if compared to the previous films it then just looks old and outdated",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Sexy T-X Makes The Movie,"Despite the hate it gets Terminator 3 is a solid movie that ties off the trilogy nicely and wraps the characters in a loop that takes us round to the first movie. Kristanna Loken is perfect as the T-X, a new more advanced Terminator sent to kill the adult John Conor this time. Her deadpan performance really brings a emotionless but murderous reality to the character. Robotic perfection. The action and special effects are very well done and the ending brings the story arc to a it's logical conclusion.
The problem here is casting Nick Stahl and Claire Danes as John Conor and his prospective romance partner Katherine Brewster, have no chemistry and even worse it becomes a stretch to accept Stahl as a future leader of humanity when those qualities are missing in the entire performance here.
Flawed it may be but Arnold Schwarzenegger battling Kristanna Loken is still amazingly fun. Go rent it or better yet, buy it!",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
T3 is a solid follow up to a classic,"T3 was actually very good. Put it this way, if we had never been treated to the classic and innovative T2, I believe a lot more people would have been in love with T3. T3 was looking at some serious obstacles: 1.) following up T2, a monster success 2.) an aging Arnold Schwarzenegger 3.) making a cohesive story that wouldn't contradict the former Terminators 4.) making a better terminator than the T-1000.As I said before, they followed up T2 respectably enough. There were good fight scenes with the T-800 and the T-X (I particularly like the fight in the bathroom), and there was an excellent car chase scene near the beginning. The action was good and plentiful, the effects were nice, and there was some good humor in the movie as well.Arnold was still in shape enough and made up enough to be believable. Of course he wore the leather jacket the entire movie. Not only that, he was an older Terminator model anyway, so any signs of stiffness or slow wittedness could easily be blamed on that.The story flowed well. John Connor (Nick Stahl) was again the focus except he is now a bit more subdued and scared. In his attempts to stay out of any electronic systems, he chooses a horrible life of joblessness, homelessness, and just plain bumming it. He was complimented by a much smarter, cleaner, and stronger partner, Kate Brewster (Claire Danes); she was tied into the story rather well. They stayed true to the Armageddon type story line and even had a bit of misdirection at the end to make the movie even more interesting.The T-X model terminator (Kristanna Loken) was nice. Sure, they chose a beautiful woman for the T-X, but she was not to be trifled with. The T-X had the same shape shifting abilities as her predecessor (the T-1000) but she also had abilities to control anything that had a CPU and she could form her hand into a variety of weapons. Similar to the T-1000 (Robert Patrick of T2), the T-X (Loken) took the T-800 (Schwarzenegger) to town, but she was a bit more dangerous even than the T-1000.T3 was a solid movie for a third installment. Usually by the third sequel you are begging Hollywood to stop, but I can't say that about this movie. This movie is good enough to watch more than once.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Disappointing trash,"The first thing one wonders about T3 is whether Arnie can still give the same performance he did in the previous two movies? If you watch this film, worrying about that, then you will eventually not be disappointed since Arnie's performance is top notch and is easily on par with the previous two. Problem is that the other characters in the movie were'nt giving it the same effort he was. Nick Stahl was completely inappropriate as John connor and comes across as a complete and utter loser incapable of doing anything while his pairing up with claire danes is nothing short of hilarious. Overall, there are a few good action scenes but the plot and acting stink. I can't believe that some people would even go as far as to compare this junk with T2!",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Introducing the T-X.,"Schwarzeneggar is back (he said he would be) as another T-1000 cyborg sent through time to protect the now grown up John Connor (Nick Stahl), and his future wife, Kate (Claire Danes), who are being stalked by the T-X (Kristanna Loken), the latest in murderous machines hellbent on destroying the human race.Rise Of The Machines might not be the (near) perfect juggernaut of an action sequel that was Cameron's Judgement Day, but as far as edge-of-the-seat, sci-fi fun goes, it's still bloody good! Director Jonathan Mostow certainly makes the most of his mega-budget, and delivers plenty of jaw-dropping mayhem along with loads of impressive special effects. And Schwarzenneggar does what he does best: blowing things up, shooting huge weapons, and delivering cheesy one-liners.The (mostly) smart script follows on nicely from The Terminator and T2, further developing the character of John Connor, neatly explaining away the absence of Linda Hamilton in a not-too-disappointing way, and brilliantly bringing the whole affair to a satisfying, and not altogether happy, conclusion. There is blistering action (a set piece involving a massive crane causing untold damage to umpteen cars and buildings is absolutely incredible), some nice touches of humour, and a bit of quite gruesome violence (for a DVD that is rated 12!).Sure, T3 isn't quite as good as its predecessors, but how many films are? Both the original The Terminator and T2 are extremely tough acts to follow. I think Rise Of The Machines does a pretty good job and deserves a lot more praise than it gets.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Better than all the other sequels,"I don't get all the hate for this movie. It's a good film, by no ways perfect but a good follow up. I also enjoyed the ending pretty decent. Take a watch and see for yourself!!",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Is this supposed to be good?,"My God. I really don't know where to begin. I guess I should start with the obvious fact that this film was completely unnecessary.  Most scenes in the movie seem to have been blatantly lifted directly from the second film so much so that at many times I felt as though I was watching a remake. After sitting through this mess I had a whole new respect for the first two films as being action/sci-fi classics. I have a sneaky suspicion that this ""movie"" will be one of those over priced blockbuster hopefuls that will be all but forgotten a few years from now.The absence of James Cameron is greatly felt from the opening shot of T3, to its dreadful ending. Although he has been considered controversial because of his constant perfectionism, I guarantee you that the shameful and embarrassing acting as well as the copied storyline would not be found in the third installment had he been involved. Then again, the reason Cameron was not at the helm for this one was because he simply felt there was no more story. Things were pretty tied up at the end of T2, wouldn't you say? There isn't even a proper explanation as to why the events in T3 are even happening.Nevertheless, you just knew a third movie was going to be made and people would be having visions of Terminator greatness on their minds. It's sad to realize that fans of the Terminator films will no doubt be very disappointed (at least I think they will be). There really is nothing good about this movie and it scares me to death to think that if this particular sequel to a very well known couple of movies was this terrible, what does this hold for some of the other announced or planned big money sequels to movie franchises. If Indiana Jones 4, Die Hard 4, or even Mad Max 4 are nearly as bad as this film, God help us all.One more point I would like to stress concerning this movie would be its message/philosophy. Let me get this straight, the main point of the story is that humans simply cannot avoid what is inevitable? This is in absolute contradiction to the second film's meaning of ""No Fate But What We Make"" in which disaster can be averted if we all just wake up and realize what is about to go down. So in other words, the optimistic ending of the second film is replaced by a complete downer ending in the third film that is just hideous in how weak it is. This is bad, really bad and I have to believe that James Cameron is smoking hot with anger. I am going to try my hardest to pretend that this film (and whatever may follow it) never existed. That way I can appreciate just how entertaining and interesting the first two stories indeed are.",1.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"""I'm back!""","The law of diminishing returns was becoming plainly evident in the third film of the Terminator franchise although it eventually - albeit briefly - lives up to that terrific title.By now in his fifties Arnold Schwarzenegger was definitely looking a little long in the tooth but still looked the part; likewise Kristanna Loken as Schwarzenegger's glacial blonde nemesis who as if an ability to deal death and drive a truck wasn't enough shows remarkably good luck when she encounters a woman in a spectacular leather burgundy trouser suit that's exactly her size and seems as indestructible as she is.Neither are given much to say, but that's probably just as well.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

"A reasonably fitting end to the series, or a vision of things to come?","Terminator 3 was nothing short of a thrill-ride of explosions, over-the-top action and fun - although after three movies I am finding the Terminator series getting very repetitive. Is it just me, or does it seem like a member of the resistance comes back to protect John Connor/Sarah Connor, the machines send back a Terminator to take them out - we see some fights and bingo-bango, a couple hours later it is all resolved?I felt Terminator 3 lacked the look and feel of the classic Terminator 2, and often bordered on unintentionally comical scenes. I had to laugh at some of the fight scenes between The Terminator and the T-X, which seemed like some sort of CGI bad dream. On the opposite side of the coin, the scenes throughout the movie which were supposed to be comical, felt very cheesy and tacked-on, i.e. the Elton John glasses.That aside, Terminator 3 was packed full of what Arnie movies do best - fights, chases and s*** getting blown up. The car chase scene involving the crane was great, and as far as I am concerned was better than The Matrix Reloaded's attempt at a car chase any day. The T-X, played by very cute Kristanna Loken, brought a freshness to her role as the 'Anti-Terminator' Terminator. The T-X seems to take the best of the Terminator and the T-1000, and chucks in some extra firepower for added effectiveness.Terminator 3 might not add as much to the overall story as possibly Terminator 2, but it will fill a lot of holes, expand on some of the concepts hinted at in previous movies and tie up some loose ends in the series. You will learn more about John Connor's future, Skynet, Judgement Day, and the future of mankind's battle against the machines.As for the ending? Well I thought it was a very interesting and thought-provoking way to end the movie, and possibly the series. Although given Hollywood, I would imagine there will probably be at least one or two more movies. With or without Arnold, the series surely must move away from the ""send back a Terminator to kill John, and they send one to protect him"" style, and take us to the future where John Connor takes control of the resistance.I give T3 an 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

T3 killed the Terminator Saga!,"Having been an almost fanatical fan of T1 and T2 i awaited the release of T3 with much anticipation. I had purchased the special editions of the previous 2 films on DVD, and now i was awaiting for the third to come out on theaters. Then i went and saw it...Oh boy! Was it a stink fest and a half. I'm sorry, but the previous two films had developed characters, serious villains and realistic scenes (as realistic as a Science Fiction films get). T3 however took the great Saga of the Terminator films, dumbed it down to a generic action movie and did what Cameron did not want to do in t2, make the Terminator a clown. I almost walked out of the film when i saw that the Terminator kept being the butt of every joke. Sure there were chuckles in T2 when the Terminator didn't act quite human but in T3 he was just missing the big red shoes, very sad cause i like Arnold as an actor. I was expecting for the Director to take the movie seriously, but instead it seemed almost a comedy, shattering the image of the Terminators as implacable killing machines and making them comical. I guess i know now how Star Wars fans felt when they saw Episode 1. In conclusion, the thin story line, 2d characters and general atrocious scenes of random violence made this film the nose dive of the saga. If a 4th film is made i doubt it will ever come out of the gutter. Sad really, cause it was my favorite movie.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Healthy and well executed continuation of the series, not submitting to genre convention while exploring its leads in an impressive manner.","Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines seems to hold up for me, on subsequent viewings. I took to it the first time I saw it, and have since been quite surprised by the level of antagonism most people have toward it. The film is far from the disaster it could have been; it draws on inspiration from the previous two films and rather than aim to go bigger and better, it actually opts to go underneath them – this, it most certainly achieves. Drawing on the fast moving element of chase and the very bleak atmosphere the first film had, Terminator 3 delivers as a downbeat and briskly paced thriller with a science-fiction twist. It additionally works as a polished action film, something the second Terminator film was, with numerous action set pieces but with additional substance in the form of studies of individuals and their hardened bodies. Unlike the second film, however, which offered hope at the end of the narrative; Terminator 3 sticks to its guns and concludes on a downbeat tone, echoing the first film and setting up what will be a supposed number of sequels.I think a lot of people dislike the film because they're told to dislike the film; almost as if people are frightened of reading too much into the text. Yes, Cameron had no input to its production; yes, the enemy Terminator is a female; yes, Schwarzenegger's 'good' Terminator is a lot less sympathetic and there's a smaller focus on man and machine co-existing, but so what? The film remains an interesting character piece, establishing would-be hard bodied heroes and fleshing them out. On the other strand, it tells the tale of a certain military individual by name of Lieutenant General Robert Brewster (Andrews) and his final developments, along with the United States Air Force, of a complicated new weapons system they inherited from Cyberdyne Systems following their destruction in the second film. Brewster jokingly, but ominously, talks about how he wants to keep humans and their decisions 'in the loop' when it comes to co-existing with machines.The film begins with a now adult John Connor (Stahl), a nobody, an everyday guy whom does some work here and there; drifts on his motorcycle; rues the death of his mother Sarah and sits atop high bridges late at night with a beer, quite possibly contemplating suicide. The first glimpses of this individual goes against the more typical image of an action genre lead: John is weak and a relative nobody, whilst possesses very few skills. He will once again get put through the survival grinder as Arnold Schwarzenegger, in his third innings as his career defining role, is sent back to 2003 to protect him from a more advanced enemy robot named the T-X (Loken), a female super-assassin who is five times the antagonist the T-1000 was in terms of both power and ability. Like Robert Patrick's role, and to a degree Schwarzenegger's in the first film, the film opts for a relative unknown in Kristanna Loken who pulls off her role with the same anonymity and menace as her predecessors.Going through the grinder with John and the T-850 Terminator is Kate Brewster (Danes), the daughter of the aforementioned Robert of high military importance. Kate is the film's secondary study of a would-be hard bodied character; she successfully goes from squealing, screaming veterinarian to miniature Hunter Killer destroyer-come-soldier in what is a moment of realisation by both characters that she is of that material – those that groan in disappointment at this occurrence are those that have completely missed the study in transition, thus going back to what I say about people being afraid to read too much into it. Much earlier on, she additionally displays a hardened attitude when she outsmarts John, mistaking him for a junkie breaking into the veterinarian hospital, and locks him in an animal cage. Kate advances, emotionally, as she looses those she loves and becomes more weary of the situation.The T-X acts as an interesting element to the film. The filmmakers have not updated the 'role' of the antagonistic robot purely to be different and offer variation in the role. Rather, they have allowed the most powerful character in the entire film to be a woman, something that is relatively unheard of in today's action genre. Equally refreshing is the refraining from turning both the T-X and Kate into objects of desire, forever developing and fleshing out one as the other ponders a woman's role in the new world she been transported back to when she observes a bra advertisement board asking us 'What is Sexy?' For those out for the set pieces, the film includes a few scenes of great action: the initial coming together of the robotic forces and the ensuing escape/acquiring of Kate and John as well as a shootout and consequent escape at a cemetery, during which Earl Boen gets an amusing cameo. The Terminator and the TX have an additional hand-to-hand fight in a public bathroom.The film is, essentially, a tragedy rather than a glorification of violence or a fetishisation of explosions. It documents mankind's inability to come to terms with the weapons they have at their disposal and modernity in general. I find Terminator 3 to be interesting in its own right, and worthy of a place on the mantle amongst the first two, but to echo Sarah Connor's words as she journeys to destroy the Cyberdyne building in Terminator 2: furthering the franchise into the future is 'a venture into the unknown, a making up of history as we go along'. It may yet prove to be futile and a bit of a miss-judgement and that, like judgement day, money-making sequels to established franchises ""are inevitable"".",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Great to see the Terminator again, but not a memorable classic compared to the previous Terminator movies","After 12 long years, the Terminator is back. Between 1991 and 2003 there were many rumours surrounding a possible Terminator 3 with James Cameron at the helm and the return of Arnold Schwarzenegger. However, with many ideas going flat as well as possible adversaries to beat the T-1000 (one magazine in 1995 suggested Shaquille O'Neal was going to be the next Terminator to go up against Arnold) however nothing eventuated, particularly with Carolco Pictures going bankrupt in 1996. A lot of Terminator fans were eagerly looking forward to see a new Terminator sequel. Terminator fans had their prayers answered when Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines was released in 2003. I thought Terminator 3 was a good movie and a worthy sequel, but overall was not great. To be fair, it was certainly going to be a hard act to follow. Given that Terminator 2: Judgement Day was a huge blockbuster that set the benchmark for all movies, Terminator 3 had a lot to live up to.Following the events of Terminator 2: Judgement Day, we learn that Judgement Day did not eventuate on August 29 1997 however John Connor (Nick Stahl who has taken over from Edward Furlong) has since disappeared of the grid. His mother Sarah Connor has since passed away from leukaemia, John does small jobs from time to time and lives as a drifter around Los Angeles. John still lives in fear that Skynet may track him down and kill him. Unable to find John Connor, Skynet sends back the T-X (Kristanna Loken), an female Terminator with an advanced prototype succeeding its predecessors with built-in weaponry within its endoskeleton, a liquid metal exterior similar to the T-1000, and the ability to re-program other machines. The T-X is sent back to terminate John Connor's future lieutenants and other members of the human resistance. Another objective of the T-X is to terminate John Connor's future wife and second in command Katherine Brewster (Claire Danes). To protect and ensure the survival of John Connor, a new Terminator (Arnold Schwarzenegger) is sent back by the human resistance to prevent the T-X from successfully completing her mission. At the same time, Katherine Brewster's father who is a high ranking US Air Force Officer General Robert Brewster (David Andrews) has taken over from Miles Dyson's work from Cyberdyne Systems is linking up the US Military computers to a program called Skynet to run the entire US Military system. The Terminator, John Connor and Katherine Brewster must race against time to prevent the T-X from successfully completing its mission, and to prevent the nuclear war.Jonathon Mostow (U-571, Breakdown) takes over from James Cameron who declined to take the director's chair. Though Jonathon Mostow does a good job and he remains faithful to the previous Terminator movies, he still does not have the same magic touch as James Cameron. It was good to see various references to previous Terminator movies, but in terms of action it was certainly not going to outdo the previous Terminator movies. Terminator 2: Judgement Day certainly expanded on the first Terminator movie, whereas in Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines it continues on the legacy by bringing forth new ideas.Arnold Schwarzenegger returns in his iconic role as the Terminator. Though Arnold Schwarzenegger was 54 years old at the time of filming, he still has the Midas touch, one-liners and all. It was a thrill to see Arnold Schwarzenegger return as the Terminator. It was also the last starring role for Arnold Schwarzenegger before being elected as the Governor of California.Nick Stahl was uninspiring as John Connor came across as a bit wimpy and was came across as a geek compared to Edward Furlong who had a lot more guts with his character and possessed a strong personality as John Connor, somebody with backbone who had the potential to be a future leader of the human resistance. Unfortunately Edward Furlong was missed as John Connor, however was dropped from his famous role due to substance abuse problems.Kristanna Loken as the T-X did not have the same intimidation factor as the first Terminator and the T-1000, but she was just met the standard as a worthy adversary in this movie. She barely has any speaking parts as well.Claire Danes as Katherine Brewster came across as very mature and was someone that stood up and fought back rather than come across as a helpless damsel in distress. She moves on from her past roles such as Romeo and Juliet (1996) to portray John Connor's future wife and a strong willed second in command.Earl Boen reprises his role in a brief cameo as Dr Peter Silberman from the previous Terminator movies. Though it was only one scene, it was great to see the famous Dr Silberman return in one scene.As previously mentioned some of the action scenes in the movie were not as memorable compared to the previous Terminator movies. The crane pursuit through downtown Los Angeles wasn't bad but didn't exactly outdo the action scenes in the previous Terminator movies which were a classic and kept audiences excited. The climax where the machines take over the Air Force base was the most exciting part of the movie.Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines was always going to be a hard act to follow compared to its predecessors but it is certainly a worthy entry into the Terminator series. I was also glad that Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines didn't have the violence watered down, although it was noticeably less violent. Though Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines was not a memorable classic compared to The Terminator and Terminator 2: Judgement Day, it left me satisfied well enough that it was good to see the Terminator blast onto our screens once again.7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Not so good.....but watchable!,"""Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines"" attempts to capitalize on the success of its predecessors but ultimately falls short, delivering a lackluster and forgettable viewing experience. The film tries to recapture the magic of the earlier Terminator movies, but instead, it feels like a mere shadow of what once was.One of the biggest letdowns of ""Terminator 3"" is its reliance on generic action sequences and over-the-top CGI effects. The film sacrifices storytelling and character development in favor of bombastic explosions and mindless destruction, leaving audiences with little to invest in emotionally. The once-gripping and suspenseful plot of the Terminator series is reduced to a formulaic and predictable narrative that fails to surprise or engage viewers.Another major flaw of the movie is its portrayal of the characters. The iconic Sarah Connor is sorely missed, and the new characters introduced in this installment lack the depth and complexity that made the original cast so compelling. The dialogue is uninspired, and the performances feel wooden and uninspired, failing to capture the essence of the characters they are supposed to portray.""Terminator 3"" fails to bring anything new to the table. Instead of exploring fresh themes or pushing the boundaries of the Terminator universe, the film retreads familiar ground, rehashing old ideas without adding anything of substance. The lack of innovation and creative vision makes ""Terminator 3"" feel like a cheap imitation of its predecessors rather than a worthy successor.""Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines"" is a disappointing sequel that fails to live up to the legacy of the franchise. Its reliance on superficial action and CGI spectacle, combined with shallow characters and a lackluster plot, make it a forgettable addition to the Terminator series.

"Wait, there's yet another new terminator model?...","I thoroughly enjoyed ""The Terminator"" and ""Terminator 2"", so of course I was essentially thrilled when they released the third movie to the franchise.

So I got around to watching it again, just for kicks, you know...The storyline was adequate, although somewhat generic and too straight forward. ""Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines"" was very predictable, which was a shame, because it seemed like they just squandered all the potential that they had served on a silver platter.The movie does have good acting performances and certainly was nice to see Schwarzenegger back in this iconic role.The new terminator model, the T-X, seemed a bit too far out there, as if they had to surpass the model from the ""Terminator 2"" movie.

Better now than in 2003 - and worth seeing for the ending alone,"While it's not The Terminator or Terminator 2, it's probably the last of the Terminator films really worth watching. Something I've actually changed my mind over, over the years.I'm very glad T3 ended up having something to say, as I didn't appreciate by then writers failing to come up with an explanation as to how new Terminators keep appearing, and appearing, and appearing...! (Remember Reese's line in the first film, about what happened right before it was ""just him, and me""? It's novel then even as to why T2 happened... viewers of the first film who watched closely will know what I'm talking about here. T2 got away with it, only because it was so good).That aside, what do we have then, in T3...? Well, some always entertaining, if formulaic at times, action scenes. Some well acted and sincere moments too from and between Arnie, Nick Stahl (no Edward Furlong from T2, but better again than I remembered him back on release), and Claire Danes. She was also better than I remembered. Excellent sets, special effects. And the late, great Stan Winston's excellent makeup efforts again - all top notch.Some mistakes and missed opps they made though in this film... pretty significant ones too.First: for the T-X: she was played for sexual appeal and laughs too much in the opening scenes. Arnold is mocked too, especially in the opening scenes. It doesn't set the tone right at all, for starting the film. A real shame, because the film gets more sincere and earnest later on. That initial tone imbalance jars watching the rest, quite a bit.Second: after T2's heart-breaking, brilliant conclusion, they perhaps should have made the brave move, and ditched Arnold. The writing would have to be exemplary for that (it was ok, but not great for most of the film). But Arnie was definitely beginning to show his age in this one.It also might have made the scenes with the T-X (if you had to have her), more novel and interesting with, say, Robert Patrick reprising as a T1000 if possible. Arnold appearing just in timely flashbacks/or a cameo may have been very poignant, if they had written it well.Third: adjusting to the T-1000 as well (Patrick or no Patrick), in contrast to the T-800, would have made for some HUGE possibilities of character exploration and growth in John Connor. Just imagine him navigating an emotional version of what his mother had to go through. Shame - scripted well, it could have been terrific. We could have had finally exploring other narrative possibilities of the two newer Terminators, with opposing motivations, but in the direct shadow and aftermath of Arnold.However. After these key gripes: what really saves this film and sets it apart from being just pretty average, is the ending. The audiences maybe weren't quite ready for it in 2003, but by golly, does it resonate in the years since.I hated it back in the day... but now, it asks so many questions to me. I'm really pleased the filmmakers had the guts to do as they did. No spoilers here, but I notice other reviewers have re-appraised the film, just as I did on this. And so, I feel, might you if you're watching it again after a long time.In summary then: if T3's a new watch to you, don't even bother, before seeing the first two films. Sadly, don't perhaps expect either the same quality throughout as those two masterpieces. However, if you do watch it, and let the ending sit with you, it resonates in unexpected ways: as good films should do.In an age sadly of renewed real life wars in 2022, the Terminator films' core message sadly has returned once again.

Rubbish! Total waste of time!,"I was really looking forward to seeing Terminator 3 and I wasdisappointed in the extreme with what I saw.  This movie isterrible!  It would be a blessing if  someone would destroy all thecopies.There is no plot.  The first 45 minutes are just one long chase withmassive destruction and nothing special.  The next 45 minutes areequally forgettable.  Schwartzenegger is wooden beyond words,John Connor (Nick Stahl) is a weak-chinned-wimp with none of thebrash charm that he had in Terminator 2 and the woman T-Xterminator (Kristanna Loken) looks like a Barbie Doll.  The otherfemale lead, Claire Danes, is transparent.The movie cost $170,000,000.00 and given this incredible sumand the number of supposedly talented people who worked on thefilm, I expected much more.At this moment Schwartzenegger has thrown his hat into the ringfor the California recall vote.

Risible machines,"People often complain that Terminator 2 was too kid-friendly  there were too many lame attempts at humour. Well, I've never had a problem with T2, preferring it to the original, but with Rise of the Machines the franchise goes too far. The most gut-wrenchingly awful bit has to be the infamous ""talk to da hand"" scene. What the hell? The Terminator should have smashed the teller's head into the counter, not sassed him.And the scene that inspires this response is just as bad  the scene where a naked Arnie (still looking buff and questioning straight men's sexuality) walks into a club and gets 'dissed' by an exceedingly camp stripper. ""Woah, bitch, wait your turn,"" the imbecile says. And then when Arnie asks for his clothes we get the ""talk to the hand"" line. I don't care how deeply Edward Furlong annoyed you, or how hard you laughed when Arnie tried to express machine emotions, it's nowhere near as bad the series becoming like something you'd see on Ricki Lake.Plus the stripping scene hits the nail far too hard on the head. Yes, we know that as much as he loves groping young ladies, Arnie is overwhelmingly gay, but the homosexuality present in his films should be less overt  where's the fun if it's handed to you on a plate? Commando certainly wouldn't have warranted repeated viewings or extended analysis if there'd been a scene where Bennett had caressed Matrix's toned ass. And then to further confound matters, there's a moment when, dressed like a leather daddy, Arnie puts on some Elton John sunglasses as 'Macho Man' plays in the background. The Terminator has become a laughing stock.But this moment isn't a one off. At quite a few different points in time, Arnie seems to be sending himself and the film up. There's one bit where he's driving John Connor (Nick Stahl) and Kate Brewster (Claire Danes) to safety and he tells Danes to ""shut up"". But the line delivery is tongue in cheek. Who knew that machines could be knowingly mischievous? Another awful moment is when Arnie insists that he's not a robot but a cybernetic organism. Yay, the Terminator is PC now as well. (Next we'll probably get a black Terminator who insists he's a 'cybernetic organism of colour'.)And yet another indignity Arnie has to face is when his system gets corrupted by the TX. He has to enter the William Shatner school of acting  writhing in pain as he fights against himself. It's a pretty lousy scene.Not fairing any better is the TX  or the Terminatrix (vomit). She doesn't have the menace of the T-1000, plus she has a goofy machine arm that can spew flames and laser bolts. It's incredibly silly. And while Robert Patrick looked cold as ice and completely insane, Kristanna Loken looks like a bland, mildly bored fashionista  Patrick subverted the image of a cop, while Loken gets to wear flairs and high heels.Another detail that illustrates how lacklustre Loken's performance is is the way she tilts her head when she controls other machines with her gnarly powers. This cliché has been worn to death. It's something you'd expect to see on a bad TV show, not a massive blockbuster. And although Loken gets to kill children and shoot people in the face, with one notable exception, all her slayings are rather dull. They lack flair. However, at least the exception makes up for it somewhat  in her only decent killing, the TX rams her fist through a man's chest and drives the car from the back seat; nice!But this aside, the action is rather disappointing. Even the much lauded crane chase fails to get the blood pumping  it certainly pales in comparison to the storm drain chase in T2. And the TX/T-101 fight is a poor imitation of the fight at the end of Judgment Day and the shootout in the graveyard is a second rate version of the similar scene at the Cyberdyne offices. It just doesn't have the same intensity. And while part of this is due to the fact that the film's too light-hearted, it's also because the film desperately misses Brad Fiedel's score  the music is completely anonymous.Another problem is that there's far too much obvious CGI. Just take the fight between the T-101 and the TX in the toilets. There are far too many moments when you can clearly see that it's badly rendered computer models that are getting thrown about. It takes you out of the film. And speaking of CGI, why is it that the effects in T2 look so much better than the ones here? The damage that the TX takes isn't as convincing as the hits that the T-1000 takes, the brief glimpse that we get of the endoskeletons are crap and Skynet's vehicles and weaponry are awful. Maybe it's because T2, as pioneering as it was in its use of CGI, used a lot of physical effects too. Here you just feel that the filmmakers have got lazy. (By the way, what's with those crappy pot-bellied tank things? Whoever designed them should hang their head in shame.)About the only thing that works in the film is the ending. It's much better than it has any right to be. But it doesn't erase the crap that comes before it. Rise of the Machines is a poor film.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
All effects,"Arnie's back as the machine with the Austrian accent and this time he's programmed to be a good bot who has to take on a later model bad girl babebot, T-X, who is slimmer, cuter, and can kick his butt. With wall to wall state-of-the-art effects, T3 wreaks death and destruction from beginning to end while Stahl and Danes run around looking for the plot which seems to be buried somewhere in technobabble and rubble.

What Happened to John?,"I just have one really important question for the filmmakers, what happened to John Connor?? In the second film he was only ten but was a really tough smart mouthed one, the fourth film had an adult tough John Connor that was believable that he was the same boy from T2. The third film however, for some strange reason, casted young adult Connor as a whim. Not only did he look nothing like a strong soldier but he also was mentally destroyed, seriously doubt anyone raised like he was raised would be complaining about be worth nothing or giving up on life. Luckily the fourth movie casted Christian Bale and gave Connor his balls back. That was my main problem with T3, besides how they made it the exact same way as the second one. Fell into the typical thought that if a movie was popular a sequel that's exactly the same plot will be an equal hit; most fans of a film series grows tired if they're all the same in thought. Schwarzenegger is once again great at playing everyone's favorite robot, he's the best part of this movie.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Honestly...,"I liked this film. It wasn't as good as the original Terminator film, but it was popcorn entertainment, and for that reason, it was a decent film.So, for the plot: John Conner, played this time by Nick Stahl, now in his early 20's, is living as a drifter, when all of a sudden, he is once again thrown into the world he tried to forget. A Terminatrix, played by Kristanna Loken, has set out to kill John Conner, while the Resistance decides to send another T-101 to protect Conner. Notice how I didn't put who played the T-101? That's because I don't have to tell you, because we all know who it is. So, while there are different elements to the movie, it is kind of similar to the first two films in that a Terminator comes to kill John Conner (or, in the first movie's case, his mother), and someone, or something, also comes from the past to be the hero of the film. Same old, same old, but it's still entertaining.The actors did a good job. Kristanna Loken was quite sexy as the new Terminatrix who sets out to kill John Conner. Claire Danes is along for the ride as Kate who turns out to play an even more important role in the Resistance than even she realizes. Nick Stahl does a decent enough job as Connor, although he probably wouldn't have been my first pick. And, of course, who must come back to play the character we all know the most, but the Governator himself. Arnold's acting is kind of robotic, and while that seems like a bad thing, considering the fact that he does play a robot, it really works in this film.The one thing that makes me rate it lower than the first two films is that there were quite a number of times in which I actually laughed at some of the one-liners. While they were funny, they really shouldn't have been there. It kind of made me wonder why the film was rated R in the first place to tell you the truth. But, some of them were funny, so I won't detract too much points from the film for that reason.The action sequences though were top notch. This is the reason why I watched the film; I don't watch the Transformers movies for the acting because I know I'll be disappointed. The same thing kind of goes for the Terminator films, although the acting here is quite a bit better than that of the Transformers films. It is the action sequences that you want to see here, and so, if you go into this film expecting it to be about acting and dialogue, you might be a little disappointed. But, if you go in with popcorn entertainment on your mind, you won't be disappointed.All in all, though Terminator 3 by no means attains the pinnacle that was the second and the first movie, it is still a refreshing add-on to the Terminator franchise. An 8/10 for me.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

"An excellent installment, worth the 12-year wait.","When I first heard that James Cameron wasn't going to be involved with the third installment to this fantastic series, I was less than pleased.  The thought of another director taking over the franchise kind of upset me, I just had to hope that they would find a director that could fill those rather large shoes.  I later heard that Jonathan Mostow was named director of T3 and was pleased due to being VERY impressed with both of his previous directorial efforts, ""Breakdown"" and ""U-571"", but of course I was still skeptical.So the film was finally released and of course I went and saw it opening weekend.  Let me tell you I was NOT let down!  I thought the film was truly fantastic!  I'm sure a lot of people will disagree with me and I'm sure plenty might even get upset with me, but I thought ""Terminator 3"" was just as good as both previous installments of the series.  They all had their pros and they all had their cons.I was at first a little uneasy with the idea of a female terminator.  But, after seeing the film and thinking about I've come to the conclusion that having a female terminator if a brilliant idea.  What would have an easier time infiltrating just about anything?  A gorgeous and sexy woman or a large intimidating man?  The woman, definitely!  Besides, Jonathan Mostow did such a fantastic job with the T-X that it just worked perfectly.The special effects in the film are truly amazing, looking even better than the effects in T2.  There were VERY few times where I thought it looked like obvious CG.  There is one scene in the first few minutes of the film that show a slew of Terminators walking around doing what they do that nearly brought tears to my eyes, it looked so awesome!  I won't get into the specifics, but the special effects are reason enough to see this film.The actors all did a fantastic job.  I thought Nick Stahl was an excellent replacement for Edward Furlong.  When I first heard Nick was taking over the role I didn't think he looked the part, but he really pulled it off.  In fact, in the end, I'm happier that Nick took over the role rather than Edward Furlong continuing his role, because I really don't think Edward looks the part anymore, he was fine as the young John Connor, but I don't think he'd work well as the John Connor of this film.  Claire Danes did a fantastic job as well, she pulled off a great job in the film and looks as beautiful as ever.  Kristanna Loken plays the part of the T-X very well, looking sexy as can be and doing a great job with her facial expressions and her limited dialogue.  I'll definitely be keeping an eye out for her future work.  Then of course, there's the great Arnold Schwarzenegger, reprising his role as The Terminator (T-800/T-101).  Arnold, again was excellent as the Terminator and didn't let me down.  There is also a very nice cameo by Earl Boen, the only other actor to reprise a role from the first two installments in the Terminator series.  Despite having very little screen time, he did a great job and I was very happy to see him in the film.Personally I thought the story in this film was great and very well thought out.  There are a few things that may have been overlooked or improperly explained, but nonetheless, this is a movie we're talking about here and there are bound to be a few plot holes, so I didn't let those little things affect my enjoyment of the film.The only thing I would complain about if I had to, is some of the humor in the film.  I won't deny that the jokes were funny, but I thought some were a little misplaced, this is, after all an R-rated sci-fi/action film.  There were only really two or three comedic moments that I thought should have been excised from the film, but otherwise I thought everything worked pretty well.I would definitely recommend this film to anyone that liked the previous Terminator films.  I would hope that you can enjoy this for what it is and not what James Cameron MIGHT have done had he directed the film.  Just because Cameron opted not to direct the film does not mean it's a bad film. Don't get hung up on the fact that Cameron didn't direct it, just sit back and enjoy the ride.

A Thrilling Continuation of the Iconic Franchise,"Plot: ""Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines"" picks up years after the events of its predecessor, with a new Terminator model, the T-X, sent back in time to eliminate John Connor (Nick Stahl), the future leader of the resistance against the machines. Joined by the reprogrammed T-850 Terminator (Arnold Schwarzenegger), John races against time to prevent the rise of the machines and save humanity from a catastrophic fate.Review: ""Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines"" successfully revives the beloved franchise with its gripping storyline and impressive action sequences. While it may not reach the heights of its predecessors, this installment maintains the essence and excitement that fans have come to expect. The plot builds upon the established mythology, introducing new threats and challenges that keep the narrative fresh and engaging.Arnold Schwarzenegger returns with his iconic portrayal of the Terminator, delivering the right blend of stoic determination and dry humor. His chemistry with Nick Stahl, who portrays John Connor, adds depth to their characters' evolving dynamic as they face the relentless pursuit of the T-X, played convincingly by Kristanna Loken.The action sequences in ""Terminator 3"" are a highlight, showcasing thrilling chases, intense shootouts, and jaw-dropping visual effects. The film strikes a balance between practical stunts and CGI, resulting in realistic and visually impressive set pieces that raise the stakes and keep the audience invested.Despite the absence of series creator James Cameron, director Jonathan Mostow manages to capture the essence of the franchise, infusing the film with a gritty and dark atmosphere while delivering moments of levity. The pacing of the film is generally well-maintained, with a steady stream of action and suspense that keeps viewers engaged.While some critics argue that the film lacks the depth and innovation of its predecessors, ""Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines"" is a solid entry in the franchise. It successfully continues the story, introduces new elements, and provides a thrilling cinematic experience for both fans and newcomers. With its strong performances, intense action, and a satisfying conclusion, this installment proves that the Terminator saga still has plenty of life left in it.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A tragic continuation of two astounding films,"I beg of you not to pay to watch this film. Doing do will only encourage further series-destroying sequels.The inventiveness, the atmosphere, the sincerity, the tension and so many other attributes of the first two films are gleefully swept away by this trash. Perhaps James Cameron is not the finest director in America, but after 109 painful minutes of this film you realise just what Cameron could do, and Mostow can't.The attempt to inject humour into this film at every opportunity was severely misjudged. Cameron's screenplay for the first and second film kept the tension high, explained the story without becoming over complicated and involved us with the characters. No fear of any of this with Terminator 3. After about twenty minutes I couldn't have cared less what happened to any of the characters, and Nich Stahl's acting is so lamentable that you are left to wonder who could have possibly been worse in the role.Mostow's direction is a mess, with scenes shot too close, removing style and clarity from chase scenes and reducing them to a bewildering array of explosions and broken glass. Eyes quickly glaze over, and you just know everything will work out in some way for our dull heroes.The special effects in this are not a patch on other recent productions, and the glossy computer animation of the terminators, especially during the opening future-war scene and Loken's weapon attachment are lacking all the ingenuity of the sublime T-1000 effects from 1991.Add to this mix an appalling score by Marco Beltrami that is instantly forgettable (surely a recognisable theme would have been the first priority in such a hackneyed film) and a complete irreverence for the story of the previous two films and you're left with a movie that makes you wish you hadn't seen it, and wish that the studio had left Cameron's work alone.",1.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Rise of the Machines,"With no James Cameron involved what so ever with this project. The whole shift of the franchise turned from this film onwards. The biggest problem with this film is the humour, it is cringe to watch, pretty much all the humour falls flat throughout the film. The film also looked like they didn't know what to with the story itself. Arnold's performance looks off a bit, (it was he last big film before he became governor). John Connor is this film is so bad to watch, all he does is complain and it will get on people nerves. The effects are no where as great as T2. Saying that, there are like couple of decent action set pieces, but it doesn't help the movie.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

"Terminator 3: Rise Of The Machines"" Rises To New Levels","The film picks up a number of years after the last feature as we see John Connor (Stahl), future leader and Saviour of the human race, in his mid twenties (I'd guess), living 'off the grid' since the events from the last film (if you haven't seen the previous two films I don't know what the heck you're doing here, but whatever...). Turns out 'judgment day' was not averted, as initially thought at the end of the 2nd film, but only postponed, as Skynet is around in some form, as indicated by the arrival of a Terminator robot, a model T-X played by Loken. It seems now the future is populated by really hot and sexy blonde robots with definite feminine characteristics...homina, homina...soon after we see another Terminator arrive, the muscled one we're more accustomed to, played by Arnold. Seems the T-X model, or Terminatrix Bot has been sent back to target Connor, but if it can't get to him, it's supposed to go after those who would be his lieutenants, including that of Kate Brewster (Danes), whose father, played by Andrews, just happens to be some military bigwig in charge of the program which will eventually become Skynet, the artificial intelligence that will eventually take over the world, exterminating the human threat. Make sense? Probably not...anyway, given this new threat, someone from within the resistance from the future decided to send back an Arnold robot to protect whomever needed protecting, but its task a difficult one given the sophistication of the T-X model, which is essentially an enhanced logic weapons systems cybernetic combat infiltration unit with nanotechnological transjectors inside a titanium battle chassis surrounded by a mimetic poly alloy...whew! So what does all that mean? Well, it can manipulate machines under computer control, tap into communications systems, and produce weaponry from within, including a wicked plasma cannon from its arm, among other things. Things aren't looking so good for John (or the human race, for that matter), but did I mention the Terminatrix is really hot?Given the fact Terminator 2 made as much as it did at the box office, I'm not surprised someone decided to continue on with the franchise, despite the fact the story had been pretty much wrapped up at the end of the second film. Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines does try to fit itself within the continuity of the previous two films, and, on the surface it succeeds, but once you start picking at the loose threads, there are inconsistencies (then again, when we're talking about time travel, who's to say what could and couldn't happen?). Now, I'm not going to go through and relate all the bits I thought out of place as I'm sure many have already done so, and done so a lot better than I could have, but I will say if you take this movie at face value (a straight up action film), you'll probably have a lot more fun. There was one bit that really bothered me, though, and that was when John, Kate, and the Arnold Bot were trying to contact Kate's father, who just happened to be secured away in some top-secret military installation. One minute they're driving towards the place and the next they're inside, talking to Kate's father...I suppose the Arnold Bot could have bypassed the security somehow, but it all seemed rather convenient, especially given the circumstances. I did like the whole bit about a widespread virus running through the Internet, where it came from, and its ultimate purpose. The characters in this film seemed to take a backseat to the action, as none are really developed as much as they were in the previous films. Perhaps the filmmakers were relying on the character development already out there from the earlier films, but given so few characters carried over, this didn't work out so well. One of the biggest weaknesses in the film, in my opinion, was that of Stahl's character of John Connor. There seemed to be an awful lot of inconsistencies indicating perhaps this wasn't the same John Connor as was in the previous movie. I'm not a big fan of Stahl (he reminds me too much of Giovanni Ribisi, whom I care even less for), but I thought he did pretty well in the film Sin City (2005). As far as Danes, well, she looked good, but her performance was limited by her role, as it was written. While the plot and the characters may have been half-baked, at least the action was balls out. My favourite bit involved a car chase sequence featuring a gigantic crane truck barreling through city streets, causing massive amounts of destruction. Another great bit was when the two Terminators were fighting each other within the military base, and the Arnold Bot uses a urinal as an offensive weapon. The first time I saw this film and the ending was presented I found myself saying ""What the f***?"", but, after watching it again last night it did seem to make sense in terms of the story presented. All in all I thought this a great action film, but in terms of a sequel to the Terminator series, it was so-so...I'd agree with Cameron that there really wasn't anything left to tell in the story, but if there's a chance to make money, you know Hollywood will capitalize.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
He warned us didn't he??!!!,"Movie legacies are a funny thing. Some work because of the structure of the subject matter, some work because of the profit opportunities. But only a few have been able to pull off lasting success. The one's that have not you can usually spot from the phrase `haven't they got anything better to do' upon release of the sixteenth film. The Terminator falls into that category, and although it as seemingly concluded, it's back for a third time. Money talks as they say.Arnold Schwarzenegger returns in one of cinema's most illustrious characters, once again trying to save the world from certain destruction. Judgment Day, the rise of machines, was merely postponed, and now, ten years on, the machines will try again. This time, they have sent there most advanced creation, the T-X (Loken), sexy, sleek and highly affective, to destroy a now adult John Connor (Stahl), and his future wife, Katherine Brewster (Danes). However, the resistance was able to send a lone warrior back through time, the T-101 (Schwarzenegger) to ensure the survival of our young saviours.For a decade, fans were well aware that the Terminator's `father', James Cameron, was not returning. Without him, T3 was never going to be easy. Nevertheless, T3 is, thankfully and surprisingly, damn good. Maintaining the intelligence, compassion, action and multi-layered premise of the first two genre-defining films was always going to be near impossible, but the filmmakers, to their credit, intelligently leave Cameron's oeuvre aside, opting instead for simplicity, which is where the films strength lies. They create a film that keeps the core and shape of the saga, and add enough human emotion, and self-discovery to keep the undertones of the trilogy pulsing, leaving enough room for $170 million worth of SFX, extraordinary chase sequences sci-fi babble, explosions and other action-packed hullabaloo.That's not a bad thing mind you, far from it. The film is a class above your average action flick, and Mostow proves himself quite a deft hand when it comes to action, as well keeping the emotion and drama of the film integral to the film, which he does with trademark poise or flair. As Mostow excels, his cast are something of a mixed bag: on the plus side, Schwarzenegger is again superb, delivering a performance, which is both chilling and extremely tongue in cheek, and newcomer Loken is also impressive as the destructive yet alluring T-X, proving a great foil for Arnie in all departments, and adds a welcome dimension to the trilogy. One the negative side, however, are the young actors: Stahl is badly disjointed, his nice guy persona out of place in the aggressive and loutish role of Connor, and Claire Danes, though at times commendable, is restricted to a clichéd `damsel' role, running around screaming her lungs out and panting loudly.Nevertheless, loud panting noises and nit-picking aside, T3 is really is a treat. Action-packed, funny, beautifully orchestrated, and made with an intelligence sorely lacking from the modern day blockbuster, it's the must see film of the year. And if you don't like it, I think you need your hard drive thoroughly virus checked. ****",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Arnold does it again!,"My girlfriend and I spoke to a friend before seeing this movie, and he said he did not like it. But, trusting the 7.2 vote it recieved from IMDB, we chanced it--and thank God we did. This has got to be the best action movie I've seen in years. We loved it. Some other friends said that there was a more humorous side to it, so I went into the movie expecting a hammed up version of its predessosor; however, the ""comedic"" scenes just added to the entertainment of the movie, they did not detract from it's seriousness that the end of the earth as we know is near. The ending was fantastic and added more intrigue to the idea that machines will rule the earth and fight mankind for its rule.

This film is a disgrace,"I have been a fan of Schwarzenegger for many years, and I have even money on him becoming president at odds 500/1. However, his last good film was True Lies. After this he had made a lot of garbage, probably being topped off with the enigma that is Terminator 3. What do you get when you have a lame script, a mediocre director and a lead actor that is not as hip as he used to be? The answer is a lame film. Another viewer rated the scene where he gets his clothes off a homosexual stripper a good one. I think it was very stupid, and totally destroyed any credibility that the terminator had built up in the first two outings. The rise of the machines and the almost total destruction of human kind is not a subject to me made fun of, and it is very sad that they did not understand this when they made T3. The T3 script is a mess. It is as if the script for Terminator 2 was a vase but it fell to the floor and broke and then a group of retards tried to glue the pieces together. I am a fan of Nick Stahl, and he was in my opinion one of the few that did a good job here. This is just very sad.",1.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

B-Movie with Some Third Act Ambition,"Okay, let's face it:  Most of this film is a retread of the basic beats from Terminator 2.  But the truth is that Terminator 2 was basically a retread of the first Terminator, right down to its ""here's another truck over-turning"" third act.  What Terminator 2 had going for it was the raw power and surprise of a pumped up Linda Hamilton; plus the new CGI morphing effects that brought the T-1000 to life; and the fresh twist that Arnold was now the ""good guy.""  Still, at the end of the second film, we basically were back where we started, with the nuclear armaggedon again supposedly stopped.  It lacked real scope.  Terminator 3 finally takes us somewhere new in its final minutes, and this is what really elevates an okay action retread a bit higher making it a worthy sequel--especially if it means we finally get to the good stuff in the fourth film.  Mostow is a bit of a journeyman, without much grace or artistry.  The female T-X makes less of an impression than one would've hoped.  But in its final few minutes, it does what most sci-fi films unfortunately never do:  Makes you wonder how in the hell it will end.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"It was fine, but the 2 previous parts were better","The action scenes were good, the acting is good too and it was somewhat predictable and sometimes unpredictable, but i think the 2 movies were better because they had better atmospheres, and better action, the thing is the plot is so similar with the 2 movies, and they should have changed the plot more, i'm not saying this movie is bad, i meant it's worth the watch, but it's not better than the 2 previous movies, and 1 good thing with this movie is there are lots of enemies, this movie wasn't a waste of time, but like what i said it's not better than the 2 previous movies",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
It's Good To Be Back,"Mostow has injected a lot of the same spirit from previous Terminator films into Terminator 3, cleverly causing you to undergo a bit of what weightlifters call `muscle memory.' Although wildly entertaining and pleasantly reminiscent of past films, Terminator 3 as a whole did not resonate like the first two films. That's not to say it didn't achieve greatness, just not the type of greatness Cameron achieved in the good old days. The key change from Cameron to Mostow proved too dissonant for some fans. Cameronistas resent Mostow's style as action over substance. Reading their remarks on the movie forums would have one believe the film represents more of a lowering of humans than rising of machines. T3 is not T2. Mostow is not Cameron. Let James Cameron be James Cameron, or at least Jim Cameron, and let everyone else be themselves.Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines had to hold its ground and simply not be bad. It held. It did more than that. It succeeded. Humor, action, and preservation of the Terminator motifs gave the film life. The word `terminated' will continue to live as a great movie euphemism. Whether or not the Terminator series will rise again, only time will tell.--Emory Rowland",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Parody of its prequels but at least it is fun to watch,"I am not going to lie Terminator 3 isn't near as good as the two previous flicks in the series, which are some of the most historic action and science fiction movies of all time and Terminator 2 is without question one of the best films in history period. So by no means I say it is good , all I am saying is ,you will at least have fun watch it ,something which it can't be said for Salvation and Genisys ,man what misfires!So even though the Judgment Day close more or less the time-line of the series, it was decide (for cash of course0 to continue the story but it clearly done in a harry and the final product was underachieving to say the list, but the unintentional comedy in the acting and the hilariously over the top action scenes saved it from been an awful flick to a ""So dumb it is funny"".Side note here Mr. Schwarzenegger I know you wanted work after been the governor of California ,but from this flick you had to figure out that your glory days were over and for real it is impossible to be a protector muscle mass in your fifties (now seventies), sorry I love many of your films, but the truth is the truth!!Overall not good ,but a enjoyable hour and fifty (forty nine but who counts?) of action one-liners and the one thing that saves the film, the ending, no spoilers here go watch to find out for yourself ,dear reader , but for those who have seen it, it was really unexpected to be honest.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
James Cameron had nothing to do with this...and you can tell.,"""The future is not set. There is No Fate but what we make for ourselves. I wish I could believe that...but I don't."" The very opening words of this movie set up the attitude that it has towards the two movies that came before it: ""Ya know those brilliant films that James Cameron created? We're gonna throw it all out the window."" Action movies are often not very memorable. The reason behind this, I believe, is because those involved forget about character and story in favor of special effects. They regard character and story, the two most important elements, as an unfortunate necessity in story structure to give their filmed action sequences some semblance of coherence.James Cameron did what only a select few action movie directors have done: he remembered that character and story are what make the action memorable. The best action sequences are ones where you care about who's going to win, who's going to lose, who's going to survive, and who's going to die. You have to get your audience to care about the heroes so that the action actually has meaning beyond showing off your sky-high budget.Like I said, so few directors actually remember that, especially as time goes on. Michael Bay forgot about that when he made TRANSFORMERS. Cory Yuen forgot about that when he made THE TRANSPORTER. And Jonathan Mostow forgot it in TERMINATOR 3: RISE OF THE MACHINES.The story's basic enough. John Connor didn't stop Judgement Day after all. He just postponed it.There. That does it. Basically, the first two movies become meaningless with this movie around because they throw away the ""No Fate"" concept that was integral to the first two movies. But why is ""No Fate"" not true? Could they think of a logical, thought-provoking reason? No. The reason they came up with is, ""Because we need another movie.""John Connor? Unlike Edward Furlong's portrayal, which showed a young, courageous, compassionate, intelligent, punk-attitude wiz kid who could easily be seen leading the Human Resistance years from now, Nich Stahl (a good actor with a bad script) shows a John Connor who cries and complains at every turn and does nothing remotely heroic throughout the entire movie.The Terminator? Although Arnold once created one of the most menacing villains in the history of the silver screen, and later a computer-programmed killer capable of learning and caring, here he is reduced to a one-line spouting source of ""comic"" relief.I prefer to think that this tarnish to Cameron's legacy was never made.",1.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

an insult to the original,"Action movies usually don't manage to develop a deep and interesting storyline. And most of them don't even want to. That is fine, since there are a lot of people who like to watch an easy entertaining movie once in a while.""Terminator 2: Judgment Day"" proved that action movies can be so much more. Sometimes it would seem to you that incredible special effects don't let any financial room for a script (see ""Waterworld""), but T2 had it all: Awesome directing, award-winning special effects, a very becoming soundtrack, actors who did an incredible job (Linda especially) and a story that made it my all time favorite.That is why Terminator 3 fails. The team might have produced a decent action movie a la ""Predator"", but in this case, they hit a whole franchise right in the face. The soundtrack is boring, the movie goes against principles that the first two laid out, the Terminator acts ridiculous, the pictures are nothing compared to the most of the time impressive and artistic scenes from T2.Makes one wonder.. why was this movie even made? The ONLY reason is profit. I know that the goal of every movie is to make money, but if you can feel that there's no love for the project involved, it's crap.

A welcome addition to the Terminator franchise.,"Although T3 never reaches the heights of the second movie, it is a welcome addition to the Terminator franchise.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Apparently There is Fate.,"When a sequel comes along 12 years after the fact, it is almost always met with cynicism and scrutiny. Never has the case been truer than with ""Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines."" The fact of the matter is that the two films before it redefined the science fiction genre in their own time, and the question loomed about whether or not a third film was warranted or even logical. Afterall, we saw the Connor clan in ""Terminator 2: Judgment Day"" take down Skynet in its infancy stages, thus preventing Judgment Day, right? To quote the T-800's infamous gun-shop dialogue from the original ""Terminator"" film: ""Wrong.""With original creator James Cameron completely out of the picture, director Jonathan Mostow takes the reins with Arnold Schwarzenegger returning to his titular role once more before settling in as the Governator of California. John Connor, the future leader of the resistance, is played by Nick Stahl this time around as we follow the character at age 22, with the world on the brink of the nuclear fall-out at the hands of Skynet. As before, a T-800 is sent back to ensure his survival, as well as that of his future wife (played by Claire Danes) while another, far more advanced female Terminator is sent back to ensure Connor is taken out of the picture and Judgment Day goes on as planned.One thing the film is missing for certain is James Cameron's touch. To be fair, Mostow is a thoroughly competent action director, but there's a sense of ""been there, done that"" with most of the story that makes the proceedings rather stale. You could chalk that up to poor writing, but also because its predecessor leaves the story with nowhere to go. Until it reaches the end, ""Terminator 3"" just sort of meanders along, waiting to reach that moment where all is redeemed and John Connor finally is forced to accept his destiny. Having said that, though, there are some excellent action scenes to fill the time with therefore the film never gets boring or loses its pacing.The film has been somewhat maligned for its humor, but it's important to note that it's not anymore of a comedy than ""Terminator 2"" was. Quite contrary, the bulk of the film is rather dark and brooding, and goes a long way in ensuring the correct mood and tone is established. There's also some key imagery in the film that makes it somewhat iconic. One scene early on during John's opening dialogue cuts to an ocean floor lined with human skulls and will send chills down your spine, as will the somber ending, which in the end, makes the film. Overall, ""Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines"" is definitely a worthy entry in the series, and in spite of its redundancy, manages to entertain as well as push forward the mythology of the franchise.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Not as good as the first two.,"Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines picks up years after the events of Terminator 2. Cyberdyne has been destroyed, the war has been averted, but John Connor is still afraid. He drops off the grid. He drifts from town to town while there is no record of his existence. Now, a new terminator called the T-X is sent back to kill John Connor once and for all, and once again, a T-800 model is sent back to protect him. He finds out the war has only been delayed, and now he must try to find a new way to stop it. This is a fun, action packed film, but it doesn't live up to the first two.James Cameron is no longer the director, which is the film's first problem. Next, the style is too different. A lot of comic relief was put into the script, and at some points it was highly unnecessary. The story in this movie only manages to confuse anybody that was paying attention to the second film. There are too many questions that go unanswered at the end of this movie. What I did like about this movie was that it finally showed us how the war started, and that was really cool to see. I also liked all the references that were made to the second film, like when John Connor asks the terminator if he remembers ""hasta la vista, baby."" Some of the humorous parts got a good laugh out of me, but it just got to be too much at some parts.The acting was pretty good. Arnold played the role that he created perfectly. Nick Stahl did a very good job taking over for Edward Furlong. Kristanna Loken does well as the new Terminator.Overall, this movie contains a lot of action, humour, and is really fun to watch, but it's a disappointment after the second film.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
He's back again.,"Essentially, 'Terminator 3: Rise Of The Machines (2003)' combines the philosophies of the first two movies, positing that the future isn't set but that certain events are, perhaps, inevitable. In this way, it presents a natural and rather interesting extension to the previously established narrative. It's actually a solid story filled with nice character moments and generally intriguing ideas. It also makes a few bold choices which end up being vital to its success. Obviously, it's not as tight as the first or as exciting as the second, and it's not as well-written as either, but it's a competent, surprisingly effective tale nevertheless. Generally, it is a little silly, though. Usually, this isn't too much of an issue; the action scenes are as energetic and engaging as ever, if more outlandish and occasionally downright goofy, and the tone isn't as unbalanced as you might think. Sometimes, however, you do get the sense that things are a little too over-the-top - especially in comparison to its consistently grounded predecessors. There are a few, sporadic moments of comedy that don't quite work. Likewise, some of the 'serious' stuff is a little too serious to be taken seriously (I'm looking at you, opening narration). I think the pacing helps you overlook a lot of these issues, as the thing really does move. As I said before, it's entertaining, too. To say he didn't want to be here, Schwarzenegger is doing a decent job. The character is written as if he has his learning capabilities already unlocked (see the director's cut of 'Terminator 2: Judgement Day (1991)') but that's not too much of a leap. His counterpart is presented as a machine designed to kill machines and does, indeed, feel like she outmatches him. The design of some of her elements seems a little strange - as does the overall 'rigid endoskeleton/ liquid-metal skin' combo - but she's menacing enough. It helps that the chase is pretty much constant this time, essentially being the driving force behind even the more 'grand-scheme' plot. Some of the effects-work leans too far into early-2000s CG to be believable but there's just enough practicality, especially in the car-chase scene, to make up for that. Generally, the flick is much more enjoyable than you might think. It rounds off the narrative of the 'trilogy' rather well, even including some decent overarching character development, and feels fairly complete. Of course, it isn't as good as either of the films it follows. However, it's undeniably entertaining, despite being silly, and that counts for quite a bit. 6/10.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

After all, didn't Jim Cameron have a breakthrough success with ""ALIENS""...and he didn't produce the first one... so I kept an open mindThis one had much more humor in it than the 2 previous films, the whole theater erupted with uncontrollable laughter at the ""TALK TO THE HAND!"" scene at the beginning of the film. The chase scene was great too (MATRIX 2's chase scene blows T3's chase Scene away). and yes the plot did have some holes.... but I can over look those holes because the plot holes seem to be what keeps the story line going from one film to the next (in other words, plot holes are a necessary evil if you want to keep the story going).I couldn't help but feel like this film was acting as a bridge story that is setting the stage for future Terminator movies (probably without Arnald)that will take place in the futuristic post nuclear war landscape where humans are fighting the war against the machines....In a strange kinda way, I hope that is exactly what is happening with this franchise... we'll see in the futureI give this film 7 out of 10 stars -go see it, its pretty good",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Road to Nowhere,"I suppose I should grateful that we have been graced with a final installment just to tidy things up given the enthusiasm for trilogies of late but, is this one wise? I think not. Pointless and very, very disappointing is more apt. I have been generous in my rating. What Terminator 3 shows is that the absence of a good story cannot be patched up with the now all too familiar CG scenes. Arnie looks and is old and the intensity that Linda Hamilton brought to the earlier two films is gone. The plot was almost certainly written in the 1950's and Ed Wood did it better. It's as if it's a plot searching for a reason to be and hoping no-one will notice the colour by numbers patchwork that passes for a storyline. This could have been wrapped up in 20 minutes in the vastly superior T2, had it been written. In the end we are being treated to an exercise in pure capitalism.

A Different Type of Terminator  ---86%,"FIRST IMPRESSIONSI just couldnt imagine a better sequel to Terminator 2: Judgement Day, which is probably the best action movie of all time.  But, after seeing T3: Rise of the Machines, I came to one conclusion: T2 and T3 are different types of movies.  And T3 ends up on top.SUMMARYThe famous John Conner is all grown up now, and yes, you guessed it, is still being hunted down by robots sent from the future.  But this time around, its no ordinary robot.  The Terminatrix is far more superior in speed, strength and intelligence than John Conner's only chance for survival.  Yes, the Terminator is back, but he has to protect not only John Conner, but also a mysterious young woman whose purpose throughout the war with the machines appears to be unknown.FUN FACTOR: 95%This movie is one fun thing to watch.  Probably the most exciting movie to watch this year, and that includes The Matrix: Reloaded.  Every scene in this action masterpiece, even the dramatic scenes, is vividly interesting. I remember when I was watching this movie in the theater, and halfway through I dropped my hot dog on my shirt.  And it was nasty, all this relish and onion and ketchup all over.  But, I didn't really care; I just kept on watching.  Maybe, I'm just crazy.ACTING: 85%Well, lets start with none other than The Terminator.  With a far greater arsenal of humorous lines and actions (the reoccurring scenes with the sunglasses), the Terminator's ""personality"" is far more expressed in this film than in the previous two.  And the new additions of Claire Danes and Nick Stahl efficiently make up for the missing Linda Hamilton.  The T-X (Terminatrix) shows as much emotion as she can, which is not much.  But, hey, she's a killing robot.  Still, overall, decent acting by the main stars, and great improvement by Arnold in the comedy department.STORY: 80 %What made the first two installments classics was the storyline.  Its intricate plot, full of twists of time travel effects, the first two movies were not only action movies, but thrillers.  And, this element is what lacks in T3.  Now, this is such a bad thing.  T3 just happens to be more of an action movie.  The movie had some elements of time travel and the future war here and there, but not as much as the first two.  Still, the end of the movie (I'm not going to give anything away) left me with a bunch of questions.  And thats a good thing.  A really good thing.DIRECTION: 85%When I found out that James Cameron was not going to do the upcoming Terminator, I thought this is going to be a blowout.  But it wasnt. Jonathan Mostow took the job, and made an excellent movie.  I have to admit, T3 has a totally different look from the last two.  While the first two were darker, T3 is more explosion.  Its mainly because T-1000, equipped with only his hands and the shapes they can become, relies more on stealth and close combat.  With that type of enemy, the atmosphere of the movie must always be dark.  In T3, however, the T-X relies on guns and, therefore, at-a-distance type combat.  That creates more explosions and less blood.  That's another thing, T3 is not even close to being as violent as the first two.  To sum up, T3 has a lighter look compared to its predecessors, but is still successful in this transition.FINAL IMPRESSION: ---86%With an excellent cast of characters, breathtaking action scenes, and a little bit of fresh humor added in, T3 is, undoubtedly, a worthy addition to a classic series.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Trash. An insult to James Cameron and an even bigger insult to the Terminator story.,"First off, i generally give good reviews on lots of movies because i like to turn off from the real world and i realize that movies are for entertainment, but having said that i think Terminator 3 was the biggest load of trash i have ever seen. I LOVED the first two, the cast, the script, the storyline the effects blahblahblah everything was PERFECT, but this movie? Jesus no.Now the much debated storyline was of course a letdown, i still don't understand how something they prevented from being made (skynet) suddenly existed and how  did they manage to send 2 terminators back when there isn't even a  war, maybe i missed a large chunk of the movie or something, i think the idea is something to do with the war being inevitable even though theres no way all this shit could have happend in the first place, it just did, cool.as for the acting, the one liners were awful, the new enemy was a nice idea but the chick who played her role sucked :( And the whole tight leather outfit just made it even made it look even more pathetic. Thew new john conner wasn't john conner at all. I think the only good addition to the movie was claire danes, she played her part well, props to her.2 scenes which i hated were:1) bathroom fight with the 2 terminators - the tx just throws arnold across the room with no effort, why would she have a problem fighting him after? yes i know she did kick his ass but he shouldn't have been able to put up the slightest bit of a fight, they should have either kept it even or made it a complete blowout (one termiantor destroying the other) they shouldn't have done both it was just retarded.2) when arnold was approaching john outside the plane trying to resist hurting him - robots don't have emotions, IF A ROBOT IS PROGRAMMED TO DO SOMETHING IT DOES IT, NOT BECAUSE SOME GUY HE DOESN'T EVEN KNOW DOESN'T WANT HIM TO. And the fact that he slightly changes his voice when he says ""I AM A MACHINE"" made me sad. It seems as though nobody else noticed that but whatever.there was probably a million other things i could point out, but i can't be bothered, so anyway i think that this movie was a real let down, a below par trashy movie with women in leather cheesy one liners car chases and a typical ending for marketing, they'll obviously make another, lets hope james cameron answers our prayers and brings back the magic that was in the first two.0.5/10.",1.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
So much was lacking from this movie...,"as compared to T2. I loved T2. The special effects were new and story was great. T3 has your average special effects, but the problem is the story is not very good nor interesting. I'm glad I didn't see it at the theater. Most of the chase scenes are rather boring since it's nothing new.  And the new TX doesn't do a lot of cool stuff. Plus, this movie was made like a pg-13 film. There were only a couple of scenes that made it an R. The terminator films are R movies because they have blood and violence. In T3, there is a lot of violence from machine guns, but the only real blood involves the TX sticking her arm through a cop while he's driving.There is a cameo from the doctor at the psych ward in T2. He just runs off when he sees Arnie. There was so much potential for a big laugh there, but we didn't get it.And the way Arnie dies here is so uneventful as compared in T2. In T2 it was moving, but we don't even see him die on screen here. The ending does set itself up for a sequel that has a lot of potential, but they don't need to make it if James Cameron won't do it.FINAL VERDICT: If you are someone just dying to know what happens next in the terminator series, than check it out. Otherwise, it isn't that great of a film just to pick up at the video store.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Not as good as the first two but still worthy of the franchise,"Its not very often that film sequels can maintain a franchise and from personal experience, films seem to get worse as more sequels are made. This film didn't disappoint. It may not be as good as the original two but it still maintains great acting, the original back plot and a whole new original storyline of its own.I didn't expect this film to be as good for several reasons 1. being the characters are different. Apart from Arnie, the entire cast has changed and it felt a little empty without the actress who plays Sarah Connor. I was a little disappointed that she had been written out but as the storyline progressed, I realised it seemed necessary. The acting in this film was as good as ever and the actors really pulled off their characters.You'd have thought the writers would have ran out of storyline by the third film but they've just proved me wrong. The storyline works well alone, is unique, and fits well with the back plot already in place. If you had never seen the previous films, you'd probably be able to watch this one and follow it fairly easily.However, I have noticed that they seem to be running out of ideas for new Terminator models and rather than sticking to an original action plot, they seemed to have replaced an efficient killing machine for a good looking woman, probably for the benefit of many guys in the cinema, who it seems, this genre is more aimed at. Another problem I had with this film was the rating. The other 2 films had a higher rating which allowed for more to be done in the film. I think this one seemed a bit limited in terms of action scenes.In conclusion, this is a pretty good film which I think works well in the franchise (not like the awful fourth film). I would recommend seeing this film, just don't expect it to be good as the first two.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Gets better with age,Second only to the original. The only negative on the rewatch is the casting of Nick Stahl. He doesn't fit the part.

"""T3"" represents a clear drop in the series' quality standard, since, despite having good action sequences, it gets complicated whenever the script tries to develop the story","Twelve years after the release of the classic second film in the franchise, a new adaptation would continue with the main plot after a change in the rights to the franchise. In her divorce from James Cameron, Linda Hamilton asked for the rights to the ""Terminator"" franchise, which she then resold to Mario Kassar and Andrew Vajna of the bankrupt Carolco. The duo's new company, C2 Pictures, financed this third film, causing confusion and at the same time expecting fans, as ""The Final Judgment"" was planned to end the story started in the first film. The story even ends with this idea, since Cyberdine (the company where Skynet would be developed) and all the evidence that could lead to new research to develop an intelligent and independent computer system had been exterminated. Curiosity was how the story would be conceived.Directed by Jonathan Mostow and with only two actors returning, Schwarzenegger and Earl Boen - who makes a brief appearance as Dr. Silberman - the story of the third film takes place ten years after ""The Final Judgment"", with John Connor (Nick Stahl) living nomadically after his mother's death from leukemia, and two exterminators being sent to the past, one to protect John and his future wife Kate Brewster (Claire Danes) and the other to kill future members of human resistance.Even with good ideas in the action part, the script by John Brancato and Michael Ferris manages to continue the plot of the second film, but it misses by discarding some pillars of the series and by bringing unforgivable holes that take the unit from the series as a whole. The temporal comings and goings always leave immense holes in the best of cinematic fiction scripts. In the case of ""Terminator 3"", there are striking discrepancies. One is especially in relation to the Schwarzenegger Exterminator. After transforming itself into a complex and moving figure in the previous film, the T-800 (now T-850) becomes a mere accessory in this third part, practically becoming an adjunct. There is no sign of chemistry and the dynamic relationship between the cyborg and his protégés here - but that is justified because it is a new model. However, the Exterminator acts in a contradictory way: at a certain moment, for example, he clarifies that it is not the same android seen previously, but just another example of the same line (something logical): however, he avoids killing humans and, in a certain scene, opens the hood of a car to look for the keys to the vehicle - two things he had learned in the second film.In contrast, Kristanna Loken has little impact like Terminatrix: although she has far more resources than previous villains (being able to access the Internet, perform DNA tests and turn her arms into powerful weapons), the cyborg does not act with the same determination unforgiving of the T-1000. The beautiful actress just does what is expected for this type of character and never really threatens the lives of the heroes. Initially, the difference in the plot consists of the mission of T-X, which includes the murder of all the human resistance generals of the future. However, a casual encounter with Connor and Kate Brewster, his future wife, will cause her to pursue him for the duration of the tape.However, the story of how John Connor has been living in recent years, especially after his mother's death, is an idea that works: traumatized and depressed, the boy is a fascinating character, since the weight of his destiny (and the glory associated with your future leadership) simply prevents you from enjoying the present. He must carry the weight of being someone he is not yet; he must live waiting for his destiny to come true, contenting himself with the mediocrity of anonymity while the future does not arrive. And what is most painful: in order to fulfill his glorious destiny, John must witness the end of the world, which is still a tragic irony of destiny. The subject is, in short, the anxious and sad veteran that his mother was in the previous film - and therein lies the main strength of this new chapter.Jonathan Mostow is able to present a typical product for large audiences, with a lot of action, electrifying sequences and moments of adrenaline, which leave the viewer unable to breathe, highlighting the chase scenes involving a crane, a fire brigade truck and a car, in addition to the escape from the cemetery where Sarah Connor's tomb was located and, obviously, the entire final sequence inside the government facility where the rebellion of the machines commanded by Skynet against humanity would take place. Still, it is still unfortunate that the best sequence is the chase that takes place at the beginning of the story, since the rest of the projection can never match up in rhythm or tension.
The director manages to recreate this beaten universe with a correct development - there are repetitions within the film itself, such as the two car chases (the first had already become so good, what for a second?) - and good doses of humor (good to know how to laugh) of himself, with quotes and references to previous episodes, such as the T-800 glasses joke at the beginning of the film and the appearance of Dr. Silberman's character, who took care of Sarah Connor in Terminator 2: The Final Judgment (1992) and that makes a small participation this time trying to comfort the young lady), in addition to managing to develop a bold but controversial ending. In general, the script brought the addition of new information about the apocalyptic future of Earth is also welcome, opening up new possibilities for the future of the series, even if contrary to the ideas presented previously.""Terminator 3"" represents a clear drop in the series' quality standard, since, despite having good action sequences, it gets complicated whenever the script tries to develop the story. This time the T-800 played by Schwarzenegger must protect not only John Connor, but also a certain Katherine Brewster. The reason? She will be Connor's wife and the couple's children 'will be important'. Now, if the leader of humans in the future had already defeated machines, what importance ('historically' speaking) could their children have? And if he has not yet won the revolution, how can his descendants matter to the future if they are still only children? The answer is obvious: this was just an excuse found by the writers to involve Danes' character in the plot and present it as the hero's romantic interest.So far, so good: despite being mediocre, the ""revelation"" does not compromise the logic of previous films. Unfortunately, however, T3 does not stop there and ends up introducing a series of new concepts regarding Skynet that radically contradict the main elements of the first two chapters - and this is inexcusable, since, in retrospect, it ends up harming its predecessors (for that we should care about the efforts made by Sarah, John and the Exterminator to destroy the Cyberdine building, in ""The Terminator 2"", if we now know that their actions are useless and wrong?). It is also regrettable to see the philosophy of the first two chapters ('There is no destiny - except what we do') being discarded in favor of a vision of ""predestination"", of the inevitability of events, as this, once again, takes us to see the actions of the brave Sarah Connor as a simple waste of sweat. And this is the biggest sin in the third film.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Action packed Terminator,While certainly not the best of the Terminator sequels this movie is still very enjoyable with intense action scenes that make good use of the CGI available at the time a great cast and a good storyline certainly worth watching.The movie follows John Connor (Nick Stahl) ten years after the events of T2 who since tye death of his mother Sarah lives off the grid until he has an accident and gets caught stealing medical supplies from a veterinary surgery by Kate Brewster (Claire Danes) a friend from Johns past a coincidence until they are both attacked by a new kind of Terminator the T-X (Kristanna Loken) but are both saved by a blast from Johns past Terminator Model 101 (Arnold Schwarzenegger) who has been sent back in time to protect them both John indends on finding out why the future hasn't changed and why the bombs still fall.The movie is well shot and directed the CGI looks great for the time and isn't to obvious or overused.I recommend this movie to any fans of science fiction and action movies best to watch the first two movies first though.,7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
It's okay.,"Terminator 3 has the misfortune of following up on Terminator 1 & 2: an impossibly difficult task that can only result in shortcomings if James Cameron, Gale Anne Hurd and Linda Hamilton aren't even touching this production at all. Terminator 3 is a noble if fatally flawed follow-up on two of sci-fi cinema's greatest stories; there was no way Terminator 3 could follow up on the T-1000 in Judgement Day and the story there was wrapped up just nicely. So where was the real need to continue? Well, it was because Judgement Day was a box office tsunami: and they HAD to do a sequel in some form I guess.Terminator 3 is a well-meaning but overly-stuffed and pandering venture in the Terminator canon. It's loaded with fan-service in reference to the first two Terminators: there's that psychologist from the first two movies, and the T-800's pacifism in T-2 is visually referenced in the form of 'Human Casualties: 000' screen-text from Arnie's point-of-view. Noble efforts, but it's unnecessary if it doesn't add anything new to the story.T-3 is okay. It's passable action and escapism, but the original Terminator and Judgement Day are still the best by a ridiculously wide margin.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

As i say we wont get another t2 so for me after so many years and watching the attrocity that is dark fate i finally except this as the sequel to t2!

Even the two or three humorous lines by Arnie can't make up for the poor plot, poor writing, and excessive special effects.This was definitely made for young men, the T-X sucked, she wasn't menacing, interesting, or threatening, unlike the T-1000 in T2. But she had big boobs. Whoopie.The acting of the two main human characters was mediocre at best. I'm not sure what the writers and director were thinking making John so slow witted and insipid, it did nothing but irritate and annoy.I bought this sight-unseen to have the complete series, and I'm sorry I wasted my money.

What a disappointment!,"I gave this a ""1"", not because it is objectively *quite* that bad, but because, given the high expectations and the extremely high production values of T1 and T2, this movie is just about the biggest under-achiever I've ever seen. The plot is recycled. The characters are recycled. The whole movie is, in a word, lame. And boring. I suspect that if Ahnold hadn't been planning a run for Gov, this piece of garbage would never have been made.Perhaps someday someone will make another Terminator episode that actually advances the story while holding the audience's interest.

It's A Fine Movie OK?!!!?,"So people these days look at my movie collection and say why do you have Terminator 3? I say because it's a good movie!

He came back! Again!,"I think with this film that it's a shame they made it so similar to the second and even to a degree the first of the series. The ending is different however.It feels like it's a bridging film to get you to the next stage. The production people got board of the current day and wanted to film the future instead and the story of this film gets them there.Arnie isn't as robotic as the previous instalments which is a bit distracting and I would still prefer him as the bad guy, but the TX is pretty awesome.There are some great comedic moments, but I wonder if they were all necessary for this type of film.I didn't really like the actor playing John Connor, but I can see how he would have grown from the brat in 'Judgement Day' and then grown to be Christian Bale's version in film number four.I have actually seen this one before, but I couldn't remember what happened, perhaps because it's not the most original story.

They should have left it at two,"The third film in the ""Terminator"" franchise deteriorates to the level of cheap action SF. (When I say cheap I'm not referring to budget, of course.) It does not bring anything new either in the story nor visually, but copies the previous film with essentially insignificant variations. Action scenes are greatly done, but since the film is virtually reduced to an endless series of explosions, it soon becomes tedious. Nick Stahl, in my opinion, is not an adequate substitute for Edward Furlong, Clare Danes is made for romantic movies and she was thorn in my eye through the whole thing, absence of Linda Hamilton feels too much, and the Schwarzenegger performance is weaker than in previous movies, although this is more to the script than to him. Practically the only thing worth watching in this movie is the beautiful Kristanna Loken in the role of the latest Terminator model.

Before Watching: Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines (2003),"""Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines"" (2003) is the third movie in the Terminator franchise. If you want to get as much out of it as possible, there are a few things you need to keep in mind before watching:Absolutely first of all: sorry to say, but this movie is far away from the quality of the first and second Terminator. If you hold them dear, think twice whether you really want to see this movie. If you still do, keep reading.Terminator 3 aims for the same level of action extravaganza that Terminator 2 had, and while it doesn't reach quite the same height, some scenes are fairly thrilling and can certainly satisfy cravings for guns and explosions. However, that is about the only positive aspect of Terminator 3, as the rest of the movie doesn't come close to the same cinematography, special effects, characters or emotions as the previous installments. It is all over the place.The most disappointing downside is the lack of charisma. John Connor in Terminator 2 has now become a homeless, college drop-out burglar who is roaming shops for some easy booze and painkillers. The new Terminator is a very sexualized femme fatale whose liquid metal body can fire laser rockets. The other protagonist, Kate, is mainly there to ask questions and push the narrative forward, and our beloved Schwarzenegger does his best in trying to live up to his former glory. Terminator 3 is very much like any other action movie from the early 00's, and suffers from uncharismatic characters with very small arcs and very little dynamic.Nevertheless, the action is acceptable. But Terminator consists of so much more.My personal grade: a displeased 6/10. If you found this helpful, check my profile for more reviews.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

"With The Future Already Written, What's The Point?","Question: Can a sequel get much worse than T3?.... Answer: I think not.Regardless of its whopping $200 million budget, T3 (which, of course, focused on violence, explosions and mass destruction) (Well, what did I expect?) certainly turned out to be some of the absolute stalest storytelling that I've had the displeasure of seeing in a mighty long time.If you ask me - I am utterly sick to death of Arnold's ""Terminator"" shtick. And, this time around, Arnold's performance (that featured some of the lamest one-liners imaginable) was a total embarrassment on all counts.After being paid a ridiculous $30 million to star in this ""Save-The-Future"" clunker, I seriously think that Arnold should be absolutely ashamed of himself for delivering such a crappy portrayal of a T-101 bimbo.With T3's story simply going over the same, old, tired ground, again and again, the viewer would have to be a totally clueless nitwit not to see that this idiotic, action yarn was going nowhere, fast.Anyways - I thought that Nick Stahl made for an utterly pathetic and completely despicable ""Saviour"" as John Connor.

Still a good Terminator film,"Say what you want about Terminator 3 Rise Of The Machines I still a strong film in the Terminator films yes I still will call the first two masterpieces and it should have not with just Terminator 2 but of course a series like the Terminator it is gonna be made into sequels.Also I'll take Terminator 3 over Terminator Salvation any day. Here's why.The plot in some ways feels like a ""What if"" Storyline as The Terminator (Arnold Schwarzenegger) is send back through time to protect John Connor (Nick Stahl) and Kate Brewster (Claire Danes) from T-X (Kristanna Loken).The film features some extreme action stunts that have you on the edge and it goes to show that the film did a lot to make it feel like Terminator and the fights were pretty intense for this one.The score in the film is pretty strong where the music helps the story of the film.There is a good bit of humor in this film but it don't take away from what the film from what it suppose to be.The special effects are pretty impressive with attention to make them look believable.

The best of this year's summer blockbusters.,"**** out of ****I feared the worst for Terminator 3.  It's premise is almost identical to T2's (Schwarzenegger Terminator heads back in time to save John Connor), the ads looked terrible, and on paper, this looked like the pitch perfect example of a popular series ruined by money-hungry studio executives.  While I have no doubt the producers of this film acted out of greed, I can safely say my fears were unfounded.  Terminator 3 is easily the summer's best pure blockbuster.It's been several years since John Connor (played by Nick Stahl) helped bring down Skynet.  But he's still frightened by the possibilities of the future, so he spends his days wandering around, his identity deleted.  Two more terminators are sent back in time, the Terminatrix (Kristanna Loken), a new design sent to assassinate Connor and his future lieutenants.  As before, a Terminator who resembles Arnold Schwarzenegger is sent as Connor's lone protector.  Added into the crisis is Kate Brewster (Clair Danes), whose presence will play a vital role into the fate of the planet's future.The possible signs of sequilitis are present here, but despite essential similarities to T2 director Jonathan Mostow crafts the movie with a look and feel that separates it from its predecessors, but does so without betraying its roots.  That's a pretty fantastic accomplishment.But before I make T3 sound like nothing more than a high-gloss rip-off, the movie does deliver an engaging story filled with genuine surprises and complications.  It works as a continuation of its predecessor's legacy, and surprisingly, this addition never feels the slightest bit gratuitous.The action sequences are the movie's highlight, especially an astounding car chase that actually puts the one in The Matrix Reloaded to shame.  Expect shootouts and plenty of explosions, but delivered with flair and energy. The last half-hour is virtually non-stop action, and Mostow maintains a high pitch of intensity.  Most impressive of all is the one-on-one showdown between the Terminators, probably the most exhilarating action setpiece I've seen all year.What surprised me the most was the attention paid to the characters.  Nick Stahl's portrayal of John Connor is entirely likeable and convincing, blowing all memories of Edward Furlong's annoying performance to dust. Clair Danes, who I've never been a big fan of, is also quite good as the requisite-but-not-quite love interest (I loved the twist involving her character and the Terminator).Schwarzenegger puts forth his most memorable portrayal of a Terminator, playing his role with a great sense of circumstantial humor.  T3 is packed with big laughs (the best being the sunglassses bit), thanks mostly to Schwarzenegger's sense of comic timing.  This is his comeback piece, and it's good to see the big lug back and better than ever.  As his villainous counterpart, Kristanna Loken is imposing as the Terminatrix, and bound to drive male teens crazy with her great figure (her nude scene frustratingly shows very little).Terminator 3's countdown to worldwide armageddon adds a sense of desperation its predecessors were missing.  The suspenseful build-up concludes satisfyingly in an ending that actually surprised and delighted me.  Sure, the set up leaves another sequel a possibility, but I actually can't wait for a Terminator 4.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Nick Stahl and Claire Danes are both really good with plenty of emotional weight to their performances.Jonathan Mostow's direction is excellent with satisfyingly practical and destructive action sequences however undermined slightly by some poor CG integrated into them.

Almost Great,"Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines (awesome title by the way) is the definition of a mixed bag. There are some great things on par with the original two movies in there, but there is also just so much stupid crap. I really like the last half hour, especially the very end. It's intense and the action is cool and the ending was really awesome and took my by surprise. But in the same film you have the Terminator in a strip club and the Terminator telling a gas station worker to talk to the hand. The TX is a menacing villain, but it's design seems like a downgrade compared to the T-1000. Also, I don't like how it treats the end of T2. There were better ways to set up a sequel, like saying that Skynet lied about the date of Judgement Day. Nick Stahl is okay as John Connor, Claire Danes gives a really good performance as Kate, and Arnold, as always, is great as the Terminator. I do like this movie quite a bit, and I cannot stress enough how much I love the good stuff in this film, but it's hard to recommend to someone who has only seen the original two. I'd say if you don't mind the end of T2 getting undermined and you're okay with some goofy elements in a Terminator film then go see it, but if the original two are some of your favorite films ever, then I'd say pass on all the sequels.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

I have a feeling that they were suggested by Arnold during the shooting and that Mostow is such a pansy that he didn't stand up and refuse to have those ridiculous lines in the movie.

Brilliant,"Although this film 'Terminator 3' Rise of the machines wasn't as good as the first two Terminator films, I can still say that I enjoyed this film. Considering how very few of the original actors were in this film, that were in the first two Terminator films, other than Arnold Swartzeneger the Terminator and Earl Boen(Dr.Peter Silberman) who was Sarah Connors Psychiatrist, I thought this film carried itself extremely well. I thought the lighting and special effects were superb and the directors choice of making the new Terminator into a woman was a great and original idea.In many ways I found this sequel somewhat more humorous compared to the other Terminator films, a humour that the other films lacked. The scene when the Terminatrix(Kristanna Loken) breasts grew larger after looking at the large breasted women on the billboard poster and when Arnold Swartzeneger(the Terminator) walked into the strip club in the nude, for everybody thought that he was a stripper hired by the nightclub, I found extremely funny. I did, however, find it unrealistic when the Terminator was deprogrammed by the Terminatrix to become bad and then mentally fought his deprogramming to remain good and managing to shut his system down. That was so unreal! Why - because the Terminator is a Cyborg, not a person. It doesn't have feelings of its own. Its programmed to follow his orders - nothing more.As all Terminator fans know, that John Connors father(Kyle Rhys) who was one of John Connors Sergeants in the future was sent back in time to the year 1984 to save Johns mother(Sarah Connor) from being killed by the Terminator. It would have been good if the Terminator named John Connors fathers name(Kyle Rhys) to John Connor(Nick Stahl) and Kate Brewster(Claire Danes) when he was telling them the listed names of the Terminatrix' assassin hitlist, who were John Connors top Sergeants/ Lieutenants in the future, that she was planning to kill. That would have been ironic for this film, for his father(Kyle Rhys) was one of John Connors top Sergeants in the year 2027, but unfortunately his name wasn't mentioned on that list. Then again, it was only fair that he wasn't on the hit list for Kyle Rees wasn't alive in the year 1997 as he was born in the year 2006.Despite the ways I feel this film could have improved, I still very much enjoyed it and would recommend anybody to watch it, as this film had amazing special effects, exciting action scenes and most of all had a fantastic storyline.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
SUCKS!!!,This movies is one of the worst I have ever seen...it's a pale version of T2....See the first 2 movies but skip this one.And the actors are so bad. Claire Danes doesn't fit the role and is annoying through the whole movie. Nick Stahl is boring. Arnold Schwarzenegger is good as usual but Kristanna Loken SUCKS big time!

t3 good,people bash stuff all the cant give credit for nothing this film is damn good stays true to Cameron storyline t2 was good but not the end this leads up to the terminators taking over and john conner leading an human resistance this is a damn good film i wish Cameron would have directed the film but he didn't and Jonathan Mostow did a good job with the movie setting up t4 and t5 Terminator 3 is a action packed adventure and takes fans to thrilling heights with dazzling effects it could have been longer thats bout the only thing i disliked bout the feature cant wait for the nuclear bombs fell at the end at gritty chilling feeling of the world ending and conner being the chosen one to lead a human resistance against the machines the series is only getting started and the next films will bring about the conclusions of the entire story with this one being the precursor,9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Arnold rules, but where's Cameron?","After leaving T3, and viewing T2 again over the holiday weekend, I realized the key thing that gives T1 and 2 the edge over this recent blockbuster. James Cameron, co-writer and director of those first two, knew right away how to do the action sequences, how to make them exciting, and even how to top himself in the sequel.  But what he was keen on was the story, the characters- for a world such so hard-edged and desolate as in these films, the overall humanity has to be all the more noticeable in order to feel for the main players.  Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines was made without anything to do with Mr. Cameron, and because of that there is a slight feeling of aloof, even as Jonathan Mostow and his writers try their best to make an impact on the saga of John Connor and the Machines.Here's the good news- the action in this film is still exciting, in the sort of dumbdy-dumb dumb flow of this season of movies, and one of the pleasures of seeing Arnold Schwarzenegger in nearly all of his films is that he can bring a laugh and a grin at the most dire of sequences, not to mention his catch phrases (some are corny ""She'll be back"", others are amusing ""Talk to the hand"").  And the new Terminator (T-X), played in a strikingly impervious and sensual efficiency by Kristina Lokken, is a good counterpart for the model 101.The bad news is that there isn't as much to take in as far as interesting new roles and situations and such, the dialogue revels in cliches instead of juggling around with them as in the other 2, and the actors who play them aren't the wiser- Claire Danes as Kathryn Brewster is convincing to a point, pushing the thankless boundaries of the helpless maiden; Nick Stahl's Connor looks and acts as much like Edward Furlong as Jodie Foster looks and acts like Julianne Moore, and the purpose for Earl Boen's Dr. Silbermen is purely for gag value at this point.The story-line takes us in this chapter as that this is the new Judgment Day, with Sky-Net on a roll to domination.  Fair enough, but the writers don't overcome any of the subtle, and not so subtle plot-holes.  For instance(s), after the Terminator goes out of the funeral parlor with the casket, gets shot at by bullets that don't leave a mark on him (which did in the last films), he shoots back and explodes some cop cars and then reading on his monitor that there wasn't one human casualty.  The reasoning for the Terminator not committing any human casualties worked in part 2 since young John Connor made him swear not to kill anyone, and in this one it isn't the same Terminator as in that one, so why is he still an ""anti-terminator terminator""?  For an R-rating there is something fishy about Arnold as a semi-pacifist trapped inside of a cybornetic organism.  And Sarah Connor dying of leukemia in 1997 will be a bit of a contradiction as to what's mentioned in the T2 book.And yet, these I suppose are my problems with such a film, and I can guess I am probably not the only one with them.  Indeed even the most shallow of movie-goers will see this is the least effective of the three in the now Terminator trilogy.  But for this summer's crowd of movie-goers, being fed the assembly line of sequels and re-fashionings of part efforts, it's certainly not indigestible, and it may keep some hoping for a part 4.  As Mr. Connor says in the film, ""there is no fate but what we make of it"". Grade: B",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Not as good as I had hoped, not as bad as I had feared.","This was a real 'middle of the road' movie. It was not as good as I had hoped but it also was not as bad as I had feared at the same time. Like most other people, I was skeptical about this movie. I mean Terminator 3 without James Cameron and Robert Patrick as villain but an yet inexperienced director and girl as villain instead? I feared the worst but at the same time I hoped that the movie might become as good as it's predecessors ""Terminator"" and ""Terminator 2: Judgment Day"". It surely had the potential and budget for that. In the end ""Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines"" might not be as good as the previous two Terminator movies but at least it's just as enjoyable.Basically this movie is just a great action-flick. I already knew that Jonathan Mostow was capable of directing a good action movie after seeing ""U-571"", so I might not had been as skeptical as most others about Mostow directing this movie. ""Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines"" also is a wonderfully directed action movie that has some highly memorable and well constructed action sequences in it. It really is due to Mostow's skills that this movie is better than the average action-flick. The movie features so great shootouts, fistfights and car chases, of which the one with the large crane truck the most memorable one. The high budget is notable in the movie and lots of stuff blows up and gets demolished. Budget well spend in this case, I say!It's not the story that makes this movie a good one. Even though it by no means is a bad story, it just lacks any real depth and emotion. The movie however sets things nicely up for a ""Terminator 4"" movie. I for one, am really looking forward to this movie, if it ever gets made. I also certainly wouldn't mind seeing Jonathan Mostow returning to direct, if James Cameron is not available/won't do it.The movie is well cast. Arnold Schwarzenegger reprises his role of 'The Terminator'. He however is given a lot more dialog this time, which perhaps was not the most wise choice, since Arnie's acting skills are highly below average. But perhaps that's also part of the charm. He yet again delivers some cheesy one-liners and the movie as a whole is surprisingly comical at times, especially when compared to the previous two Terminator movies. I think it's great that they actually picked an actor to play John Conner, who actually looked like Edward Furlong, who played John Conner in ""Terminator 2: Judgment Day"". Nick Stahl is a great new John Conner. He also has some nice chemistry with his love interest played by Claire Danes. Kristanna Loken tries very hard to surpass Robert Patrick's performance from ""Terminator 2: Judgment Day"" but she unfortunately hasn't got enough charisma for that.The movie is just nothing more than an awesome action flick. Action movie fans will absolutely love this movie. But the movie does get a git unnecessary violent at times. The movie features lots of killing of innocent persons. It's a bit too much and over-the-top perhaps at times, even for my taste, even though I'm used to seeing a lot worse in some movies. This movie simply just didn't needed that. The special effects of the movie are just great and work convincing. The nice action musical score is from Marco Beltrami. Marco Beltrami is a great and talented action movie composer that hasn't yet got the recognition which he deserves.Perhaps not as impressive and good as the previous two Terminator movies but as an action-flick this movie is just totally awesome!7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Another sequel screwing up the first 2....,"When I first heard they were making Terminator 3 I shook my head in disgust. T2 is my favorite movie of all time and to top it would be impossible, not because Cameron is this all-mighty director, although he is very good, but that the movie was just done too well in T2. From the directing, acting, plot, the score, everything. T3 has none of these traits and that's what makes it a garbage movie.I hate how Hollywood lets movies like this be created and ruin the image behind the first two completely. Just like the Alien movies, the first two were ruined by the memories of the last two. It's too bad that directors would rather make money than let people remember what the good movies stood for.On to crap 3.T3- First off, where is the music? The theme that the die-hard Terminator fans have known to love wasn't until the ending credits. Not that that makes a movie but I was looking forward to hearing it in the beginning. Not only that but there was a no music until about half-way in the movie it seemed like. It was just quiet and lame.The beginning scene was total ridiculous. He goes into the male strip bar only to say talk to the hand and NOW! to his hand. It was so lame and a complete rip-off of the T2 bar scene.The movie also have a very rush feeling to it to me. There was no character development what-so-ever. The love story didn't flow at all. Her fiancé is killed and she really didn't show any remorse or sadness that he was dead for more than a few seconds. When the Terminators first come together and the truck bounces over the girl I think I laughed out loud at how stupid that was. Not only that but the TX wasn't even scary to me and seemed less advanced than the T-1000. Robert Patrick was far more freaky as the creepy T-1000 than that girl ever was. Also, the T-1000 really couldn't be damaged. You could slow him down by freezing him or shooting but he always came back together because he was liquid. The TX was still metal underneath and could be damaged, which didn't seem more advanced to me. They couldn't come up with a better idea than the T-1000 though so they create this crap of combining the two Terminators into one. Retarded.The humor in the movie was terrible and really took away from the Terminator feel in my opinion. The Terminator is supposed to be a killing machine, ruthless, relentless, careless. But this Terminator was cracking jokes and not really hurting anyone. In T2 it made sense but only because John was teaching him not to hurt people, and he still did. Also, when the Terminator was carrying the coffin and shooting at the police why didn't he kill anyone? Again, this made no sense because John didn't teach him not to do this so why didn't he kill anyone? I can't comprehend how people like this crap.I think a major clue that the movie was going to suck before even seeing it was that it was rated PG-13. Any movie called ""Terminator"" should automatically be rated R. The other movies were more violent whereas this Terminator was a damn kids movie. Since when were Terminator movies supposed to be funny? What are they having the Terminator cracking jokes? In the second movie it made more sense because John was teaching the Terminator human speech. In this one he was just throwing out lines with no one teaching him anything. I wanted to throw a knife at the screen this movie was so bad.One thing that I didn't get is that all of a sudden in this Terminator film he can crash through pretty much any wall, smash marble, get beaten to a pulp and he is fine, not to mention put his head back on after it was knocked off which makes no sense, and fight his programming. The film was complete garbage and frankly I'm shocked that as many people liked it as I see on this board. I read people said he was a different model from the other Terminators, but when did they ever explain that in T3? Makes no sense.I have a theory that most people enjoy crap movies with no plot and just mindless action. Sadly, this is true because people would rather be entertained than have to think and this is a prime examples of that. Just like many people liked the trashy movie Independece Day because it ""kept your attention"", the same people like T3 because of the lame car chase, or the fight scene between the TX and the Terminator.I watched the making of T2 and Cameron had first written the script to have T2 as the final Terminator. The beginning scenes were actually Conner and team taking over Skynet and destroying it and finding unused 101's, and that's when he sent it back in time. However, that was cut due to run time of the movie. I for one am going to pretend T3 does not exist and that they did in fact stop the war in T2 because I can's stand the idea of T3. I wish I could go back in time and stop this movie from being created. I give it -10 out of 10. Utter garbage.",1.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A little too derivative,"I can't say I was disappointed, because I certainly enjoyed Terminator 3. HOWEVER, it was evident that this movie was unavoidably derivative of the first two Terminator movies.  Fantastic visual effects and a good story, but it certainly cannot top either of the other two Terminator movies for originality.  The problem was that nothing new or original was really introduced.  `She'll be back', both Terminators coming to Earth in a flash of nudity, all have been done before.  Kudos to Stan Winston and the people who did the visual effects for the movie, they are certainly among the best I've ever seen.  Just add something new, please.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Coming from a sick fan who's been waiting a minimum of five years to see this film, let me tell you...it doesn't disappoint!","A little low-budget film named ""The Terminator"" hit the streets in 1984. This extremely low-budget actioner was about a machine ""terminator"" sent back in time to assassinate, or ""terminate"" the soon-to-be mother of the future world resistance leader, who would fight back against Skynet's machines who would fight for their dominance of the earth.19 years later, and one sequel later, comes ""Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines,"" the massive differences between the original film being the budget, special effects, and action pieces. Being a long-time ""Terminator"" fan, of both ""T1"" and ""T2,"" I can tell you this baby don't disappoint. I have been one of those nerds on the Internet who had an old desktop wallpaper that said ""T3: Summer 2002"" on it. I have been waiting for this flick for years and years and years, a minimum of five years at least. When production finally started, and was delayed to 2003, and started again, I held my breath and expected the best. After the trailer I expected the worst. Now I got the best. This film blows you away, it's the best sequel of the year and James Cameron's absence from the film, though visible, doesn't hinder it.Judgment Day never happened. The world never got hit by nuclear bombs, the machines took over, and now a twenty-something John Connor lives ""off the grids,"" with no home, no telephone, no nothing. Just in case the machines happen to take over one day in the future and try to assassinate him again.Of course, the machines DO come back again, as without them there would be no sequel. One is a sexy terminator called the Terminatrix (Kristanna Loken), whose mission is to assassinate John Connor's future lieutenants and his future wife, a current veterinarian, Kate Brewster (Claire Danes), since the machines can't find where John Connor is (that's where the off-the-grid stuff comes in handy for him). However, John Connor happens to meet up with Kate Brewster the same night the TX tries to kill her (and now him since he is a primary target for termination), but the T-800 model cyborg (Arnold Schwarzenegger) is also back to protect them, who has been sent back in time by Kate Brewster in the future after the protection cyborg murdered John Connor...in the future, that is...err...confused yet?Wow, what a thrill ride. Give me a moment to catch my breath. Action non-stop throughout, great special effects, everything. It's nowhere near as great as the first two films, but as far as summer sequels go, this ranks in as one of the best.Arnold is back in fine form after ""End of Days"" (I liked ""The 6th Sense"" and ""Collateral Damage""), and for a brief moment in the film (when he throws Kate into the back of a truck), the way he is outlined against the night sky makes him look just like he did in the first film. His haircut is very much the same in that shot. Anywho, he's back.Nick Stahl takes over for druggie Edward Furlong in this installment, and by George he is great! Claire Danes doesn't do much but scream and run around and look pretty, but there's more purpose for her being there than in most movies like this.Like I said before, James Cameron's absence from the film IS visible, but new director Jonathan Mostow does a great job of taking over from him. The film is lacking some of the human elements that made the first so great, and it feels more like a regular action blockbuster than the predecessors. ""T2"" set a new level for action films; ""T3"" is more of a follower than a revolutionary film such as the first two. The special effects are impressive, but just like all the other films out there nowadays. ""T3"" in no way is as vicious, dark, or amazing as the first two films, which are both some of my favorite films, but Jonathan Mostow has done a great job handling Cameron's baby, and it shows, making ""T3"" neither disappointing nor bad; it's the best film of the summer, and one of the best action films in a long line of dull flicks.And in conclusion, I can honestly say that he'll be back. Trust me. So stick around. When he's back, I'll be back. But for now, hasta la vista, baby.4/5",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

T3 gets your motor running,"As an action movie Terminator 3 excels, with breath taking special effects and pulse pounding excitement. It's underlying story of the machines versus humans is of little importance here - it's merely an excuse to showcase the thrills and spills and wow audiences young and old.That being said, T3 is pleasingly more than a fast paced action. Emotional connections to the central characters become more apparent as the movie progresses. Even with the T-X machine (Kristanna Loken), I found myself concerned for her continued screen time. Arnie as always is great as the Terminator, appearing nearly 20 years after his original role, losing none of his awesomeness and ability to engage the audience. As well, the Katherine Brewster character played by Clare Danes is very reachable and Nick Stahn goes ok playing John Connor.Not without its flaws however, the movie has its fair share of nonsensical elements, which is why I couldn't go higher than 7 stars.

"Follows the lead, but...","This might actually have worked, if only some very bad CGI decisions were not made and most of all, now, a 15 years later, it is clear that the soundtrack is absolutely horrible. The score messes up everything. Not only does it not match the size of the picture (scenic size, music is too static and too close, making the image look small) but also it is wishful, meaning that the score is trying to add emotional aspects that are improper and unfitting to what is actually displayed. Someone might have been really really excited to do this score and might have had an overenthusiastic producer, but the central idea of the movie was not understood. If the score had been more traditional and not overexcited, the whole title could have been a decent 7.8

"Lacks direction, humanity and complex characters.","After over a decade of waiting, wondering what came next in the masterful Terminator franchise starring Arnold Schwarzenegger in his most famous and iconic role - Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines made it's premiere in 2003 but this time without James Cameron at the helm. In his place a competent action director in Jonathan Mostow (U571 and Breakdown) to continue the legendary mythology spelled out so meaningfully in the previous classics. No pity, no remorse - no fate but what we make, right? Wrong.Terminator 3 works as a stand-alone action film or straight up popcorn flicks for teenage multiplex hoards but as part of the acclaimed Terminator franchise it's an insulting, unintelligent and insignificant re-tread lacking direction, humanity and complex characters. If anything this devalues the franchise beyond recognition essentially back-tracking, rewriting and corrupting the mythology painstakingly established by James Cameron before trying to compensate for its lack of creativity with explosions and poorly placed slapstick humour.Its one thing to unnecessarily build upon another movie's story, but to rewrite the entire meaning behind another movie is just cheap and nasty. The story itself offered nothing besides the beginning of Judgment Day which was already the way we knew the series was headed and instead of moving the logical way, which is forward, the writers tried to implement bogus twists and instead took some rather pointless and dull steps backwards essentially reversing the entire mythology of the series.The notion desperately put forth in Terminator 3 is ridiculous, not to mention a complete repudiation of the themes and ideals spelled out so eloquently in Terminator's one and two. This is bad writing, tailored to suit an uninspired little story. How the writers felt adequate about avoiding the questions everybody has been asking for over a decade but more importantly how is it they live with themselves after re-writing the entire meaning behind such a classic mythology? 'Judgement Day is inevitable' is not an explanation. This one line shows how little talent, vision or depth the writers really had when put up to the take of writing such a large-scale film on their own.Now to character development and relationships. Terminator 3 missed so many opportunities to establish it's characters and established no atmosphere whatsoever. The score is as dry as a bone lacking little to no emotion like Brad Fidel's and if anything, anything at all the film should have emphasized even more on the character of John Connor. You know the saviour of mankind, the leader of the human resistance like Sarah in Terminator 2 but failed to because there simply wasn't any time to between the breaking of key scenes with slapstick humour by clown Arnold or more pointless action. The opening voice over with Connor was the only real development throughout the movie but can you really call that development? I'd call it an easy explanation. The opening voice over is all the insight you really get into the mind of John Connor (who gets his age wrong) and unfortunately its not enough to warrant a great character like Sarah Connor, though Stahl's performance was firm.How we went from the Terminator in 1984 to this is beyond me and while they may have the rights to the franchise but you'd think in having the rights to create such a high calibre film they'd first take the time to understand it and its importance. The writers (Brancato, Ferris) were completely void of any real new ideas and basically had re-tread old information with one original idea in mind for the movie, the oh so 'shocking' conclusion which was just another tool for yet another 'inevitable' sequel by these hacks who forgot to hold dear what Cameron's films made so memorable. 1/10",1.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

"`T3' does outpace the narrow genetics of `Hulk,' the impersonality of `Xmen,' and the inscrutable plot of `The Matrix.'","Jonathan Mostow's (`U-571') `Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines' effectively predicts the near-decimation of the human race by machines through their invincible weapon, computer software.The hope is that John Connor (Nick Stahl, `In the Bedroom') and his lieutenant, Kate Brewster (Claire Danes, `The Hours'), can repopulate the resistance with the survival help of Arnold Schwarzenegger's T-1000 robot, which is truly `back' from 2029 by way of a time machine.The new T-X killing machine is a superior female whom Arnie describes as faster and more intelligent than he, a moment of truth I found endearing and a tribute to the overall sophistication of the film, which also has Arnold reprising many of his famous one-liners with tongue firmly in cheek and about as dry as the Mojave Desert.It's that female robot that so intrigues me: Athletic-looking  Kristanna Loken inhabits the role like Naomi Watts on steroids, a blonde who can morph in a second, sometimes into an even more voluptuous lady to avoid a speeding ticket. She throws Arnie around like a stuffed animal, he looking pectorally perfect in advancing middle age, but more than this she figuratively establishes the evolution of women as superior to men in the future.Because of the egregious number of explosions and weapons in general, `T-3' misses the opportunity to build further on Arnie's wit, the theme of computer enslavement, and the emergence of women as an invincible productive and destructive force. It doesn't come close enough to George Meredith's observation that the ""God of this world is in the machine, not out of it.'`T3' does outpace, however, the narrow genetics of `Hulk,' the impersonality of `Xmen,' and the inscrutable plot of `The Matrix.'  It also wins the race for the best race of the year, in which a giant crane on a truck levels a building while jousting with a fire truck.I wanted more thought in this film and less action.  After all, I am inextricably welded to the challenges my computer offers me everyday, hoping someone will tame the ever-expanding gigabytic tyrant. Alas, it's not T3 who will save me but maybe my 800 Gateway number. However, the film is much more fun than a morning making that call.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Fine sequel not up to Cameron's previous efforts,"Terminator 3 (T3) often gets a bad rep but I think it's caused more by the greatness of T2 and how it was difficult if not impossible to beat. I didn't like how Skynet was still active even after the events of T2, it seemed to negate most sacrifices made by the protagonist and to slap the director James Cameron's work in the face (shades of Alien 3 here). However, without that, there wouldn't have been a T3 so I would have been quite satisfied if a simple explanation had been given. As it is, I had to check Wikipedia for that. The new director straddles a fine line between rip-offs and homages having at first trouble finding its own voice. It didn't feel as exciting and fresh as T2. The plot and directing were good but not as inspired as T2 either.The terminatrix was not as good a villain as the T-1000, something was missing. Arnold was still in fine form but did look older than previous films (which is unavoidable I guess ;). The actors playing Connor and Kate Brewster were quite good. The first chase scene felt a bit overlong but you've got to admire the stunt work and I don't remember that kind of truck being used in a chase before. The film and action does pick up in the second half making it more suspenseful. I loved the fight between the Terminator and the Terminatrix when they were bashing walls. I thought that was great. I also loved the bold ending very much as it's kind of surprising while also closing the big loop hole left at the end of T2. Overall, I enjoyed it quite a bit, more in the second half than the first. It's worth renting or purchasing if you're a action sci-fi or Terminator collector.Rating: 7 out of 10",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Still loving since the 2003!,"I don't understand why everyone hated this movie. Every single one had plot holes and every single one had issues, but to say it wasn't as good as t2 or a flop is just horrible opinion. John came into this movie and decided to make a movie more like the first movie and he did very well in executing the steps. From the very beginning with each introduction of the terminator / human was perfect. All of the fight scenes were great and honestly, Cameron wishes he could top the crane scene! Now don't get me wrong, I'm not saying that this is better than t2, but it's definitely a great action packed movie where you get to feel the pain, stress, excitement and depth of each character. His version of his terminator was very cool and kristana portrayed a very dark terminator. I recently went on a terminatorathon. And even salvation isn't as good as this and the two that followed are complete trash in comparison. Salvation used the same formula but not too much cgi which seems to be the dominant way to go but with high budget series in these mocks you would expect only the best cgi, but.

There is nothing particularly mind-blowing, nothing revolutionary. It is all fun and enjoyable though.I wasn't entirely convinced with Nick Stahl as John Connor, but Claire Danes was a nice addition to the cast.

The smartest move the filmmakers made was deciding not to try to outdo T2. T2 is an epic masterpiece, and trying to take that to the next level would have been near impossible. Instead, that brought things down a notch, made a smaller story, added more humor.The result is a small, wonderful film. Well, relatively small anyway. It still delivers on the action -- the big chase scene code be the greatest car chase ever committed to film. And the ending ... it's the most powerful conclusion of any film in the series.Kudos to the mind behind T3 for taking a project that could have been a disaster and making a terrific piece of cinema out of it.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Arguably the better one amongst a string of failed offerings.,"I honestly believe this third Terminator entry has been unjustly critized and hated, for when you really think about it, it's not as bad a lot of people make it out to be. I can even go further by saying it's probably the better film out of Salvation and Genisys, and many would agree.
Most problems lie with the specifics surrounding the storyline, which hits many bumps along the way and does nothing to straighten them out, that is why in the third act you sort of see the cracks and plotholes become more evident as it gets near the end.Still, there's a heavily enjoyable aspect coming from the side of the entertaining action, featuring a well-done car chase sequence that could put
other generic car chases to shame. In the acting department, Arnold still does his thing we know so well; Nick Stahl proves himself worthy as a cowardly but intuitive John Connor, who doesn't know what the future holds for him; Claire Danes wonderfully serves as a natural complement to Connor: strong, smart and efficient.
Good call on the casting director to recruit actors who's forte doesn't rely on action nor science fiction, it turned out incredibly well. Kristanna Lokken is a formidable T-X model, inspiring menacing fear to each of the human characters involved.I suggest you give this one another go, and embrace it for what it is, an acceptable follow-up to the best Terminator film ever.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Transputing Terminators,"Since the 1930ies, Science fiction, the ""genuine American fairytale"" (Gotthard Günther), has anticipated a world determined by computers. The about six generations of computers built since Zuse share that they are unable to deal with circularity, i.e. self-reference, re-entry, autopoiesis, etc., because they are constructed according to classical logic which does not allow, e.g., a statement like ""I am lying"", since this statement is true when I am lying and false when I am not lying, i.e. it is true when it is false and false when it is true. On similar reasons, comments about sentences are excluded, e.g. ""This sentence is true/false"". When we hear now, in ""Terminator 3"" (2003), a sentence like ""My command is to protect you"" or even stronger: ""Get away from me ... I have no choice ... I cannot control my functions ... I am a machine"", then it is clear that in the case of terminators, we have to deal with a trans-classic logic and hence not with simple computers but with ""trans-puters"", i.e. with computers that allow self-reference because the logical law of the Excluded Middle is abolished.From the above quotation it is also clear that when a machine says ""I have no choice ... I am a machine"", it is self-aware on what it is, i.e. it has its own will. Its third logical value besides position and negation after the abolishment of the Law of the Excluded Middle allows this kind of machine to realize the difference between its program and its intent to react appropriately in a certain situation. Not even the newest computers can realize that, since they follow a logic in which the Law of the Excluded Middle is still valid. Here we also find the profoundest reason why terminators are that human-like (and, conversely, why they like to appear in human-like shape and sometimes lead to ""hermaphroditic"" creatures like ""cyborgs"", ""androids"" and others): Control of will is hitherto still a feature by which humans are differentiated from machines. If we now watch terminators, we see that trans-puters presuppose formalization not only of cognition (like classical computers do), but also of volition. But formalization of volition would imply that from a certain point on the computer would transgress its constructor. There would not be anymore, as in classical computers, a symbiosis between constructor and construction.Such ""poly-contextural"" computers (a term introduced by G. Günther during his work at the ""Biological Computer Laboratory"" of the University of Illinois) with both formalized cognition and volition would fulfill Norbert Wiener's claim for Golem-like ""human-machines"" uttered in his book ""The Human Use of Human Beings"" (1950). However, from a general point of view it is strange that cybernetics, which was established as a science since the Macy conferences in New York (starting in 1946) and is nowadays practically extinct in the academic world, seems to survive in Science Fiction which, in its turn, is anticipating future computer generations. But since ""control"" is a core-term of cybernetics, this science may perhaps become revitalized in times where whole continents are menaced by terrorism. If this is true, one should, however, not forget that total control must not only concern the reign of cognition but most utterly the empire of the will, too. Since this must not be done as in the case of Dr. Mabuse whose aim was simply to replace the will of humans by his own, but in allowing a machine to have its OWN will, the concept of formalization of volition only will imply both control and freedom.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Last classic Terminator movie,"This is the last Terminator movie to follow the established formula devised by James Cameron, which means that this is basically a big chase action thriller with road movie elements.
The overall pace is relentless, making the few moments of respite and reflection that much more impactful and poignant.
T-X is easily one of the deadliest, destructive and formidable cyborgs in film history. The influence from Japanese manga/anime on the conception of her character (e.g. Armitage, Battle Angel Alita, Dragonball etc.) is obvious and Kristanna Loken plays her wonderfully.
Mostow's direction is fairly straightforward but perfectly frames the big action set pieces.
Arnold is in top shape - probably for the last the time in his career.Many people have criticised T3 for breaking with the message of T2. I think they are among the few who prefer Cameron alternative ""future"" ending which was mercifully scrapped in favor of the more ambiguous original ending.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

T2 for me was - as I'm sure it was for many others - one of the definitive sci-fi films of the Nineties.And yes there are plot-holes and discrepancies you could drive a crane through but I think you geeky chaps should worry less about those and get out and play with some real people a bit more.Ignore the knockers - enjoy the mayhem, sexy killer-robo-babe and Arnies' one liners and make your own mind up.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

"Passionless, cookie-cutter, derivative & dull","First and foremost, if they couldn't get James Cameron on board to helm a second sequel to ""The Terminator"", they just shouldn't have bothered, but this is Hollywood and so they pressed on, engaging the services of one Jonathan Morrow, a director you've never heard of before and aren't likely to hear of again anytime soon: simply put, this is ONE LOUSY DIRECTOR! True, no one is ever going to accuse the first two films of being part of the greatest movies ever made, and while I enjoyed the first (it was what it was: fun and creepy, even) and hated the second (too full of itself, too full of its own supposed ""importance"", it's James ""King of the World"" Cameron's overbloated message movie saying 'war is wrong!'. This just in), one can say at the very least they both had a passion, that whatever their faults the director, his stars, the screenwriter, etc., BELIEVED IN IT. Not this time, baby: from the word 'go', there isn't an original thought or idea on display, either behind or in front of the cameras, and it even goes so far as to rip its own franchise off, and not too well, either. James Cameron supposedly didn't want to do this film because he felt, correctly, that ""T2"" completed the story, and so THIS film becomes one predictable rehash of everything you've seen before, and NOT just in ""The Terminator"" movies: if you've seen even just a handful of action flicks, especially in the last few years, you'll be hard-pressed not to accurately guess what happens in each scene, or each shot, right down to the FX, which, after ""T2"", are also derivative and seem...been-there-done-that. One could hope that its stars might make up for the director's deficiencies but that's a lost cause, too: Nick Stahl, a not-untalented young actor, assumes the role of John Connor from Edward Furlong but doesn't have Furlong's sense of star-crossed vulnerability - he merely comes off cocky, and aware at every moment he's taken over a role ill-suited to him; as for the always-angst-ridden Claire Danes (seriously in danger of becoming this era's Jennifer Jason Leigh if she doesn't make a film in which she's happy, laughs, smiles, breaks wind, whatever!), she has the thankless task of replacing Linda Hamilton (this is driven home in one unintentionally funny moment when, in all seriousness, not long after Danes learns she and Stahl will be man and wife in the future and she's grabbed a gun and mowed down a machine-on-the-loose, Stahl says, ""You remind of my mother"", which gives proof that this film is not only written by a man but by a man who doesn't understand the first thing about women. I dare ANY man to say those words - ""You remind me of my mother"" - to a woman he likes or loves, then sit back and ruminate the possibility of a long, LONG, lonely existence.) Unfortunately, Danes has about 2 expressions: despair and disbelief. Both of these are understandable reactions to learning there are actual robotic lifeforms running amok in L.A. (as opposed to those making films like this), but her performance is wearing. HOWEVER, at least she GIVES a performance, unlike the Barbie doll chosen to be the Big Bad Terminator: for his role in ""T2"", Robert Patrick says he perfected his creepy, shark-like stare by studying birds of prey, and he was entirely successful in instilling fear; the young actress here (OK, so I forget her name - it isn't all that important since I seriously doubt you'll be hearing much about her) resembles nothing more than the over-blonde love child of Christina Ricci and Jamie Pressly, all work-the-runway supermodel swagger and pout, and ZERO menace; her attempts at trying to be ""fearsome"" - which consists of nothing more than lowering her chin and trying to stare through her tweezed eyebrows with her perfectly made-up eyes (apparently, in this terrible future, cyborgs - in addition to being the perfect killing machine - are also learned disciples of Estee Lauder) - are, at best, ridiculous, and often faintly hilarious. As for Arnold, well, all the concealer and pancake make-up in the world cannot hide what the camera makes GLARINGLY OBVIOUS: he's a little long-in-the-tooth for this kind of thing. At times, he practically seems to have been dipped in formaldehyde: you'll notice AT NO TIME is ANY strong light upon his face in ANYTHING but distant shots (where it may not be him, anyway), and all close-ups seem oddly darkened (Elizabeth Taylor used that trick, too: a black stocking over the lens to smooth out any tell-tale lines.) His appearance also smacks of desperation, reaching back to a role that he thought might put him back on top, after a grueling period where seemingly every film he'd made disappeared nearly without a trace. Actually, that, more than anything else, is what is wrong with this movie: the stink of desperation. Come to think of it, that ISN'T the worst thing; no...worse yet is that all concerned have succeeded in making an action film that's not just lifeless, it's dead-on-arrival.",1.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Don't Miss This Movie!,"I'm a huge fan of ""The Terminator"" franchise.  I saw the first one when I was 10 years old and it blew me away to say the least.  I was stoked to see T2 and it exceeded my greatest expectations.  When I heard that they were finally making a third film, I was thrilled.  However, I became concerned when all the problems with the film began even before the production started.  Jim Cameron not being involved made me very apprehensive about the integrity of the story and its themes about humanity and technology.  I didn't want T3 to be just a shoot-em-up action pic which the summer usually carries.  I had read Arnold saying that he wouldn't be involved in the film unless Jim Cameron was involved but when he signed without him I figured that it was either a really good script which did the first two films justice or the $30 million paycheck (I hoped it was not just the second but Arnold doesn't really need the money so the script must be descent).  The female Terminator seems a little contrived to me (through the process of elimination, it's the next antagonist that brings a new twist to the series, since the first two villians were males and Schwarzenegger had to be the hero again).  Kristanna Loken sure looked the part: tall, seductive with killer eyes and a menacing presence.  But, can the audience buy a woman ""out-manning"" Arnold.  I was pleased that they decided not to cast Eddie Furlong as John Connor.  Nick Shahl is a good actor with a couple good credits on his resume (In The Bedroom, Disturbing Behavior).  Jonathan Mostow was a strange choice I thought as director, given he only has a couple credits to his name, both with only moderate success (Breakdown, U-571).  Although, without Jim Cameron, the director is no longer a sell point anyway because no one can match his venerable appeal to sci-fi fans.  Warner Bros. just needed someone who was passionate about the project and didn't want to run it into the ground.  If Mostow took the job, he must truly believe he can pull it off. With all these pros and cons on my mind, I was very curious, nervous and excited going into this movie.  I saw the film at a private screen for the Tonight Show staff on the WB lot last Monday (June 26).  IT BLEW ME AWAY. It delivers on most fronts.  The action is intense.  It has a lot of physical stunt work which I believe to be more amazing then CGI stunts (like The Matrix films) because it comes with greater realism and bigger stakes. The special effects do not disappoint.  The T-X is very cool.  She can manipulate any machine and use them to work under her control.  She can shape-shift like the T-1000 in ""T2"" (but she is still a metallic unit under her organic guise).  She can manufacture weapons with her arms (flame-thrower, rocket-launcher).  And she isn't too hard to look at either. She was sent back through time to take out John Connor's mission partners from the future since John Connor cannot be located (he's living off the grid leaving no physical evidence of his existence whenever he goes). He's totally paranoid about this future and dreads what he knows about it.  The T-X happens upon John while attempting to terminate his future wife and parnter-in-arms (well played by Claire Daines).  But the T-800 was sent back to protect John again and he gets to John first (but barely).  The first meeting of the two Terminators culminates in a spectular car chase with a gigantic crane truck through the streets of downtown LA.  It's one of the many fantastic action pieces in the film.   The movie is basically a cat-and-mouse game between the T-800 and company and the T-X (similar story to the first two films).  This film still has the plot line about Skynet and its imminent self-awareness which actually is set to happen on the same day the film take places.  This adds great tension and suspense to the story since time becomes such a critical factor for John.  Can he once again prevent the rise of the machines and circumvent his destiny?  According to the T-800, Judgment Day has just postponed by the events which took place in ""T2"", not prevented.  John doesn't want to be the leader of the human resistance again the machines and chooses once again to stop Skynet while still trying to evade the T-X who is hot on his trail (again, another great tension-builder).  Before I continue, I need to mention one point which still bothers me a bit about the entire story behind ""T3"".  If at the end of ""T2"", all evidence of the existence of the Terminator was destroyed in the boiling steel and Cyberdine Labs was completely eradicated, how did the T-800 and other models of Terminator get invented this time around.  At the end of ""T1"" there was the wreakage of the T-800 in the hyraudlic press which inspired the creation of the hardware.  But, all that is destroyed in ""T2"". I'm willing to forget about that hole in the story since the film was so good and worth making, but it's worth mentioning anyway.  ""T3"" does lack the strong bond formed between the Terminator and John which is something that made ""T2"" surprising dramatic at times and made its ending more tragic and memorable.  But even though ""T3"" doesn't work on all the same levels of ""T2"", the film focuses much harder on the levels it takes on and makes you forget about its lack of drama.  The film has an ending I did not expect and I believe that it was the best way to end the film.  I won't spoil it for you but you won't see it coming.  I really hope that people will go see this film because it deserve to do well at the box-office.  I don't think the advertising does the film justice and may deter a lot of people from seeing it (it looks a lot like a typical summer blockbuster instead of a good film).  I wish they ran a few  trailer which toned down the stunt work and special effects and dealt more with the story and the themes so people can see that it actually has them.  Good word of mouth is what is going to fill the seats in the theater.  It will open well, I think ($75 million over the 5 day week) but it's staying power will rely on both good reviews and repeat business.  I am going to see it again this weekend and urge everyone who liked the first two not to miss the third installment.  It will not disappoint, I promise.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Better Than Expected.,"Part III(now directed by Jonathan Mostow) picks up the story of an adult John Connor(now played by Nick Stahl, who is fine, taking over from Edward Furlong) effectively living off the grid, who nonetheless finds himself pursued again by a new cyborg assassin from the future(a beautiful woman this time, nicely played by Kristanna Loken) who stumbles onto John by accident, since she was sent back to his time to assassinate all other resistance members who had nearly wiped out the machines. Once again though a familiar face(Arnold of course!) is sent back one last time to protect him(or is he?) Fantastic action punctuates this intriguing story about inevitable fate that cannot be shaped the way the Connors had hoped(Sarah is absent here...) but that one can certainly be prepared for.

Not bad. Not that good either.,"Not bad. Not that good either. The third instalment of the Terminator franchise, and the first not directed by James Cameron. The change of director doesn't make much difference.

Arnold Schwarzenegger isn't there because for the Shakespearean soliloquies but just action scenes and cheesy one- liners, and he does those well. Nick Stahl is badly cast as John Connor - he's no action hero. Claire Danes' performance is the best of the bunch. Then again, she is easily the best actor in the cast.

Look Again - There Are Different Levels To This Film,"I honestly don't understand how so many people can claim to dislike Rise of the Machines, so much, and sometimes I wonder if people are attempting to trash this film, just to show how smart and sophisticated they think they are? To begin with, the CGI special effects found in Terminator 3 are superior to those found in the following two films, and if you're not sure about that, all you need to do is compare the sequence in which the Terminatrix flips the big boom truck in Terminator 3, to the school bus accident scene in Terminator 5. In Terminator 3 we get to see paint fall off as sheet-metal buckles, a wheel falls off the truck in slow motion along with the broken wheel studs, and the frame of the boom truck bends and collapses in a completely believable manner. However, in Terminator 5, the school bus appears to inexplicably twirl and pirouette all over the Golden Gate Bridge, as if the laws of physics have somehow magically been repealed, yet at the same time the passenger compartment of the bus seems to ridiculously stay intact as the bus violently flips, and none of the main characters sustain any noteworthy injuries, or are thrown from the bus! One of the other things that also makes Terminator 3 such a great film is the believability of the characters. When the Terminatrix rips the door off of Katheryn Brewster's truck, Claire Danes uses her considerable acting skills to make you believe that she is as terrified out of her mind as a real person would be under those circumstances! (Nothing like that happens in the following films.) Also, in Terminator 3 the character of John Connor is so far from the gruff talking cutout superheroes found in Terminators 4 & 5, that he is actually so overcome with despair twice in the film, that the Terminator must intervene in order to prevent him from killing himself. Nick Stahl does a passable job of portraying John Connor as deep-seated loner with a lot of personal flaws, and the John Connor character found in Terminator 3 in light years beyond the cardboard John Connor character found in Terminators 4 & 5! It's not Shakespeare, but I think that a lot of people are missing important aspects of this film, and while your watching it, pay attention to the physics found in the CGI effects.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Terminator 3 has a number of impressive action sequences, including one that features two crashing helicopters and another in which the T-101 and T-X go at it, one-on-one. But none is more impressive than the crane chase, where the world's largest crane goes crashing through everything in its path in an out-of-control attempt to (literally) run down John and Kate.

I was saddened by it. What a waste of an opportunity to finish off the series on a high note.As a technical achievement it is exceptional but the script is flat and lifeless.

Great Film- All Things Considered.,"When I went to see Terminator 3, I was so afraid of what I might be in for. So many sequels in years past have really let me down.  But, in spite of James Cameron and Linda Hamilton's absence, and the fact that this was made over 10 years after T2, this film was not bad at all.  In fact, I enjoyed this over all other summer movies so far.I thought the action and the effect scenes were great, as well as Arnold's third performance as the terminator.  And that ""Terminatrix"".  She was perfect.  She came as close as one could wish for in terms of a superior cyborg and was ALMOST as menacing as the T1000 from T2.  This movie also does a good job of staying on track with the original story.I've heard comments about how the ""time travel stuff doesn't make sense because John Connor bla bla bla""...  Lets face it folks, when you try to work out all of the impossible scenarios with time travel movies like Back to the Future, Terminator, etc., you can find a million ""but what ifs"", so don't think that hard.

A Good Three-quel,"Terminator 3 (2003) ReviewFollow up to T2 several years after they prevented Judgment Day John Connor is in his mid twenties and his mother Sarah Connor has passed away. Nick Stahl replaces Edward Furlong (most likely due to his recent drug hiatus) Stahl is actually quite good in the role. He plays him as a conflicted lost person who has nightmares about the apocalypse. Arnold is back and remarkably hasn't aged a day since the twelve year gap from last film. He once again plays the good terminator but this time to protect someone else too. Now of course Arnold is brilliant in the role, he was born to play this character and he always gives it 100%. The film elevates every time he's on screen.The villain is female but this time is a step back from the last one. The T-X played by Kristina Loken isn't as terrifying as the other villains but is still very deadly. She seems like downgrade as she has an exo-skeleton with a liquid metal exterior but thankfully she can still imitate other people. We all know that exo-skeletons can be destroyed a lot easier than the T-1000 which was purely just liquid metal. But there are a few interesting things to her in that she can manipulate machines and vehicles to wreak havoc and she also has a built in gun which looks really cool.Director Jonathan Mostow who previously helmed the Kurt Russell thriller Breakdown does a more than average job here. It's clear he wasn't in full control with so many producers breathing down his neck telling him how to make the film. He does his best with the often silly script by John Brancato and Michael Ferris. One thing he delivers well on is the action sequences.T3 is full of great action scenes from two chase sequences, a police hold up which goes awry and an exciting bathroom fight. However some of these action scenes are exaggerated to the max with some of them going on for far too long like the bathroom fight and the first chase sequence. There is an awful lot of CGI - One scene where the terminator has to reconnect his head would have looked a lot better had it been done with animatronics. The bathroom confrontation between the two terminators also looks very cartoonish at times. There's a nice use of practical effects in parts but it ultimately relies on some often dated looking CG animations.The majority of the time it delivers but there are too many self deprecating moments from the often cartoon like sound effects and the constant self referential gags to the first movies. There are a few dumb character moments, some annoying characters and it's peppered with one too many cheesy one liners like ""Talk to the hand"" and ""I like your gun"". But the film redeems itself running at a brisk pace of 100 minutes it has some good character interactions, effective action scenes, great cinematography and a surprisingly sombre ending. It's not a classic like the first two but it's far from terrible.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Terminator returns for more carnage,"This film surprised me by not being terrible -- I guess that's not saying much, but neither is this movie; it's just trying to blow a lot of stuff up and be a fun summer movie.  As far as that goes, it's a success. Considering how many of the basic ideas here were plumbed by the first film, there's also a surprising amount to think about here.  Fundamental problems exist, however: for one thing, there is so much carnage and destruction in the first 40 minutes of the movie that nothing which follows after can top it.  Loken is not particularly memorable in the way the 2 previous Terminators were, but Stahl and Daines are fine as the new Connors/lover combo.  Arnold is his usual self, spiced here with a bit more humor than usual.Worth seeing, but only on an off night.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
excellent addition to the other terminators,"Terminator 3, Rise of the Machines was an awsome movie.  The special effects and chase scenes were very cool.  Even though James Cameron did not direct this other guy did a good job.  Schwarzenegger had a lot of funny one liners.  The TX was one thing that was wrong.  She did not look very intimidating for a deadly machine.

Schwarzenegger And The Franchise Deserve Better Than This,"Continuing my plan to watch every movie in Arnold Schwarzenegger's filmography in order, I come to Terminator 3: Rise Of The Machines.Plot In A Paragraph: John Connor is living off the grid, but a new advanced Terminator, is sent back to change the past once more. Luckily the humans had also sent a bodyguard back again too.Where to start......In basically a retread of T2, there were scenes of violence and action, with some dreary talk in between. Everything was just so Bland and uninteresting. The Terminator franchise was officially becoming a bore.First of all, the writers of the movie didn't even like Terminator movies and admittedly took the job just for the money. In his own blog, John Brancato says he and Ferris took the job because Ferris wanted a new house. Why Jonathan Mostow (another with no respect for the source material or the franchise) was given the job of directing is anybody's guess, but Arnie had approval, in his mega 33 page contract written by a super Hollywood lawyer.Arnie's Terminator is a joke right from his first scene, it's almost a parody!! A total disgrace. John Connor is an incompetent fool, and the way the T-X goes around taking down her victims is ludicrous. Take the drive thru guy for example. She not only knew he was working that night, but also that he was serving at the drive thru?? PLEASE!! Considering she can change her appearance, she only does so once. Also considering this is time travel, why didn't Skynet, give her more than a few hours to try and kill 22 targets?? Even if they were all in L.A. The full thing is just full of holes!! The lack of respect for the franchise is apparent, and if the writers and director didn't care, why should the audience??The ending saved it a little bit, but not enough to redeem everything that came before it.Arnie, wooden as an old oak beam, looks as if he were desperately wishing he was somewhere else. His performance here is miles away from the first two, and for the first time, I'm going to say he phones it in.12 years ago, thanks to T2, he was the world's No 1 action Star. He not only laughed all the way to the bank... He bought it. But what of Schwarzenegger now. Nothing had come up trumps since Eraser 7 years ago..... There is nothing he can do, and he does very little. Throughout the whole affair he looks old, tired and bored.Audiences still lapped up Terminator 3, to the tune of a $150 million domestic gross, making it the 8th highest grossing movie of the year.I'm torn between a 5 or 6/10 on this one. It's certainly better than his last three movies, but it's an awful Terminator movie.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Terminator 3: Excellent!,"T3 is a very well made movie with amazing action and awesome special effects. It had very big shoes to fill and in my opinion Mostow delivered a good (not great) film. Sure, it could have been much better but it also could have been much worse.The TX is excellent. Kristanna Loken does an impressive job. She's not as scary as Robert Patrick's T-1000 in T2, but she still delivers. Nick Stahl and Claire Danes are alright. It's great to see Arnold as the Terminator again! Although he messes up a few lines, it does not hurt the film.The problem i do have with the film is the comedy. Sure, some jokes might be funny, but it's not at the right place in a Terminator film. The movie should have been darker and more serious.One other thing that bugged me was mistake they made about John's age. In T2 John is 10 years old. But at the opening of T3, John says he was 13 during the events of T2. I cant imagine them making a mistake like that.Overall, T3 is a solid entry in the franchise and i highly recommend it to action-fanatics.8/10",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Check your brains and your eardrums at the door.,"T3 is a sad comment on the state of movies today.  I learned from the manager of the theater that I attended that the volume control in the auditorium is dictated by the studio.  If you walked out of T3 with your ears ringing and your senses scrambled, and, perhaps, even noticed the befuddled state of your brain and the distinctive wobble of your walk then there may be hope for you.  The first 30 minutes of this film had nothing but violence and noise, and the most ridiculous unnecessary chase scene ever filmed. I recall a friend's comment after listening to a particularly poor rock group, ""If you can't play good, play loud."" Terminator 3 played loud. You say you thought it was exciting, thrilling, mind-blowing, and the last word in action movies!? I say, B.S.! This film was garbage.  To compare it with either of the previous Terminator movies says much about the rapidly dimming intelligence of today's movie audience. James Cameron is certainly laughing at this atrocity. If you liked this movie, you like leaf-blowers.",1.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Useless.,"From the beginning, the absence of James Cameron and the two leading actors doomed the project.  As expected, the tight framing and loss of focus in particularly quick shots and blue tint that are commonplace in Cameron films were not here.  But that's just a stylistic complaint.  Let's move on to what's really wrong with this film.It is not entertaining or engaging.  You know the ending long before it has begun due to particular soliloquys.  The characters aren't interesting, particularly with the T-X, which did not even evoke a smidgen of fear or worry other than replicating Robert Patrick's T-1000.  The sequences play out like an average modern CGI action flick right off of the assembly line. There is no conflict, given that the previous concept of averting the future is negated by the new notion that nothing can avert Judgment Day.  This just doesn't have the heart that made the previous films work.But what really bugs Arnold fans here is that unlike the previous films of his that made you laugh because he said lines, now he has so many one liners that it becomes annoying instead of humorous.  The minute he puts on the star glasses in the opening, he immediately becomes a silly clown figure, which is bad for the character.  Pointless cameos don't help matters either. While the previous films knew how to film an action sequence, this film just plays out like a longform BMW commercial.Ultimately, it is a waste of time and money.  There is no reason for making this film other than a hefty paycheck.  It is a useless picture in that it completely negates the previous films, as well as itself.  I haven't felt this robbed by a film in quite some time.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Meh.,"Schwarzenegger is great and funny, but the guy who played John Conner was a bad casting choice. I hate to be negative, but I'm not sure what his appeal was to the casting directors - his acting skills were subpar (didn't seem emotionally connected enough at times) and he seemed sooo different from the younger John Conner they had in the second Terminator movie. I didn't find it believable that they were supposed to be the same person. There'd been all this build up to ""the great John Conner"" over the previous Terminator movies, but I was so underwhelmed by this actor. Linda Hamilton's absence is also greatly felt. Maybe she could've helped carry the movie - Clare Danes and the guy who played John Conner just can't pull it off in my opinion. Schwarzenegger is perfect for comedic effect, but he's not really ever the protagonist in these movies in the traditional sense, even though the series was named for his character. He was the best part of this movie; it's saving grace, I guess. Overall, it's an okay movie, but the first two Terminator movies were way better.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"It's OK, just missed the mark.","It was nice seeing Arnold Schwarzenegger back in action as the Terminator for this movie, still fresh and funny with his funny one-liners and quick wit, and still proving he can kick some major butt. The events of Terminator 2 have only delayed the completion of Skynet, which has sent the evil T-X (Kristanna Loken) to assassinate the future officers of TechCom and eliminate drifter John Connor (Nick Stahl). But the Resistance sends a T-800 (Schwarzenegger) from the future to the present time to protect drifter John Connor (Nick Stahl) and stop T-X.This film has the same destitute, war-fearing atmosphere as in the previous films. There are some intense action and cool special effects that highlight a slew of spectacular new weaponry the Terminator and T-X possess. The cast of characters is nicely assembled, with Stahl and and Claire Danes doing a decent job in portraying John Connor and Kate Brewster. The plot, however, lacks the urgency and suspense of the previous films and didn't have much character development, which would have made the characters more memorable and sympathized; you don't learn much from their backgrounds. The story didn't offer much originality - it basically rehashed SkyNet's continued threat to make Judgement Day happen, making this film just a mesh of action with limited drama.Overall, Terminator 3 is a lot of sci-fi action fun, but misses the mark in story and character developments.Grade C",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

So Freaking Bad!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Now, I had a feeling when they were planning on making a 3rd installment in the series that it might suck, but I kept mind open nonetheless. A few friends of mine went and saw this film in theaters and came back and raved about how great the movie was. So naturally I was interested. I waited until the movie came to video stores and then I rented it. I was not prepared for one of the worst pieces of garbage cinema I have ever seen. I could go on and on about how horrible this movie was. First of all, whoever wrote the script needs to be executed. This is prime example of what not to do. Second, the whole storyline was bogus and highly unoriginal. I was so hoping to see a futuristic waist land like how they should in the first two films and to officially see the war against the machines. Instead, they gives a load of horses---. Third, the acting was so atrocious that I could feel my brain cells leaking out of my head. Fourth, not even Arny himself could make this a fun movie. I admit that I like his silly catch phrases but it just didn't work in this film. For instance, instead of saying ""I'll Be Back"" like in the other films he says after a fight with the T-X ""She'll be Back"". Need I say more.

Rise of the Matrix clones,"1 of 10, or 2 broken thumbs.Could just as easily be a non-animated Animatrix story, though not nearly as entertaining or meaningful.It's like watching a movie of George W.

Just another movie by a corporation trying to profit off the Matrix's popularity.The acting and character choices don't help.  The main character (hero and savior) is living ""off the grid"".  Despite earning a living doing construction work and riding a big motorcycle, he looks like a childhood star (or son of a president) that got pampered most his life and then started doing drugs.Then there's the terminators' fight scenes.

"Good special effects, but poor writing. James Cameron, we needed you!!","Arnold Schwarzenegger reprises his role as the cybernetic half-human half-machine terminator in this sequel to the 1991 film Terminator 2: Judgment Day. This film begins just like its predecessors, two terminators are sent back through time. One is sent to protect members of the human resistance (Schwarzenegger), and another is sent by Skynet to terminate those who in the future lead the human's against the machines.Those who saw the first two films may be wondering how Skynet survived considering it was supposedly destroyed, and the global nuclear attack known as Judgment Day prevented. According to this film, Judgment day was only put off by the actions of John and Sarah Conner ten years earlier. This knowledge leads to a predictable story as a now adult John Conner, now played by Nick Stahl, must once again try to stop Skynet from being created while on the run from a more advanced terminator, the `TX' played by Kristanna Loken. Sarah Conner who was played by Linda Hamilton was not in this film, and the writers attempted to fill this void by adding Kate Brewster (Claire Danes), one of John's future Lieutenants and love interests.The movie did very well in one area: special effects. The chase scenes between Conner and the TX nearly matched the level of intensity present in the second Terminator film. Unfortunately, the hole left by Hamilton, and Edward Furlong (John Conner in T2) was not filled by any of the new talent in this feature.  It led to a lack of believable emotion, and for me indifference towards the characters fate.T2: Judgment Day was well acted, well written, and it contained special effects that were ahead of its time. Much of the credit for that goes to writer and director James Cameron. His absence from the third film hurt it deeply...what could have been another epic blockbuster unfortunately is just another average sci-fi action flick.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Unimaginative Sequel Fails to Bring Anything New to Series...,"One of my biggest pet peeves in modern film is the creation of completely unnecessary sequels to fantastic movies. Here, we have a prime example. In my opinion, the TERMINATOR franchise would've been better off if it'd ended with the conclusion of James Cameron's TERMINATOR 2; I really wish he'd gone with his original ending showing how Judgment Day had been avoided, thereby putting a halt to future installments. Sadly, this was not the case and in 2003 Jonathan Mostow brought us the third film in the saga. The plot is nothing we haven't seen before in two other films: the future finds the human race at war with the machines (run by Skynet) and again, an attempt is made to put an end to the human resistance movement before the war ever starts. Skynet sends a new, upgraded model of Terminator to 2003 to kill John Connor, Kate Brewster (his future wife and second-in-command), and his future lieutenants. In response, the future resistance sends back another T-800 Terminator to protect him until Judgment Day passes.So, essentially what we have here is TERMINATOR 2 all over again, without some of the best aspects of what made the second film so great: James Cameron's writing/direction, Linda Hamilton, Robert Patrick, etc). The new villain, the Terminatrix, is basically a higher-tech mash-up of the first two (a weaponized endo-skeleton and a morphing liquid metal alloy) except this time it's a woman. Too much of the film feels like a rehashing of everything we've seen that most of it is forgettable until the final 30 minutes. Once Skynet goes online and Judgment Day officially arrives, the movie becomes more entertaining as we see early Hunter-Killers and T-1's rampage through a military base. The battles between the Terminators are impressive and fun to watch, but the film wanders a little too far into camp for my tastes. Some scenes, particularly the T-800's arrival in a roadside bar for ladies' night, may elicit chuckles from some but had me groaning.One element that fails to live up to the first films are the performances of the cast. With the exception of Arnold Schwarzeneggar as the T-800 Terminator (he invented the role and he really can't go wrong), the cast doesn't strike the same chord. Nick Stahl does a decent job as John Connor and seems to be a suitable replacement for Edward Furlong but Claire Danes (as Kate Brewster) spends the majority of the movie freaking out and Loken (as the Terminatrix) tries to invoke the cold, soulless killer that was Robert Patrick's T-1000 but never quite has the same effect. If a third Terminator film was really necessary, I wish Mostow and the writers had gone a little further and tried to create a unique story to grab the audience's attention, rather than feeding us the same old formula (especially with the utilization of Judgment Day as a plot point, there's so much potential there). You won't be bored by TERMINATOR 3, as it's a halfway decent action movie, but fans of the franchise who were hoping for an explosive follow-up to Cameron's T2 probably won't find what they were hoping for.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Shallow but fun,Whilst this isn't as good as the first two films it is still entertaining but in a different way to the first films. It still has the amazing action scenes and lots of awesome destruction that really are the highlight of this nice-looking action movie. The serious tone is slightly dulled down and replaced with much more campy fun. The new breed of terminator is not as good as the liquid metal one from the last outing. The sound design was good but not outstanding. I think that the first film has the best sound surprisingly! This was functional but not memorable. The biggest problem however is that the story is weak. I didn't like how they watered the whole thing down and tried to force a sequel into a completed story. It is a basic story and takes second place to the action. It should be story and action both together! I didn't like the way that they made a joke out of the terminator. Still it was easy-going and fun. It is good that it is mostly set in the current time. Easily the weakest of the original trilogy but still a fun and campy ride and better than the Terminator films that came after this one.,7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

The trailers for this film were uniamiously bad, just your typical action/Arnold-with-a-rocketlauncher, unoriginal shoot-em-up.  What this film ended up being was a delight in acting (notably Nick Stahl as John Connor) and Claire Danes(when is she bad), story, and cinematography.The story really moved along, although it was the typical: chase John, John escapes, Re-acquire John, chase John, John escapes.  The movie felt complete in a way in which the previous installments never really did.  I left the movie satisfied, but not in the typical Hollywood fuzzy way, but in a deeper meaningful understanding way...

T3 is way sweet!,"Dude, this movie lives up to the Terminator heritage. In every regard, it ups the ante on classic themes and sequences from the last 2 movies.

The same time-travel/ apocalypse ideas remain well intact and properly advanced. The new chick Terminator is highly evolved from the last with several new tricks and gizmos, and Arnold is completely vintage in his deadpan ass-whoopin'.  From an action junkie perspective, there are quite a few parts that max out on damage and gunfire. There's plenty of scenes not even hinted at in the trailer, so you will be intrigued by some of the various developments and moments throughout the film.

A turn for the worse,"Personally i found both the first and the second film quite enjoyable, not the greatest films i´ve seen but good nonetheless. When i first heard that T3 was in the making i was actually quite pleased and thought that after such a long time they would have developed an interesting plot. What i was expecting was a much darker film than the first two, and perhaps one that would be more of an epic, great battles between men and machines, more thoughts and reflections concerning the issues that lies as the foundation for the movies. I was however, greatly disappointed with this film for more than one reason.Firstly i found the humour awfully misplaced and inappropriate. I couldn´t believe that they would do this to a movie that quite naturally had high demands from the audience, to me T3 is close to being an action/comedy, and that´s not meant in a good sence... Secondly the story is just bizarre, it´s all action and nothing else, mindless action with no substance. Maybe my expectations were too high but i just can´t help being so disappointed, the underlying theme and thought behind this movie could have made it great, but right now i´m thinking that the time i spent watching T3 is never coming back to me, makes me a little bit angry actually....",1.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Worthwhile and exciting third entry in the Terminator trilogy,"While it's not as gripping and wickedly entertaining as the original, Terminator 3 is still well worth the wait and is an exhilarating experience from start to finish.The action never lets up and there is no sugarcoating the nonstop brutal violence of the film. Kristanna Loken as the T-X is very hot and stone cold in her role as her emotionless killer robot. Arnie is great once again, proving that no-one does the terminator better than him. Apart from that he is also in amazing shape for his age and his physical presence is still very intimidating and overwhelming in the film. Whereas T2 deals with preventing judgement day and the end of the world for humans, T3 deals with preparing for it and the rise of the machines.My only criticisms are that Edward Furlong should have kept his role as John Connor. Also Sarah Connor just being abandoned in the story is wrong in my opinion and the casting of Claire Danes seems to have been thrown in just for grins. But the movie does have some very funny moments, which are a blessing. The special effects are the most mind-blowing in the series so far, and the action scenes are never less than spectacular. So if you are an Arnie or Terminator fan, or just a moviegoer in my opinion, T3 is without a doubt a must-see. Along with The Matrix Reloaded, T3 is definitely my fav film of the year.I give Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines an 8/10.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
I'll Take a Terminatrix to Go Please,"Common consensus seems to be that ""Terminator 3"" is the weakest in the series, and maybe it is.

I kept waiting for her to begin firing bullets from her boobs like that android in the ""Austin Powers"" movie. People don't seem to like that this film went for a lighter, more comic tone. But come on -- how seriously is anyone expected to take this story?The screenplay also has a reflexive quality to it, with Arnold the actor, feeling his age as an action movie star, playing an old and outdated model of cyborg, who can't keep up with the new times.Grade: B+",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

"Well, at least it's not good as the first two but what can I say? I'm back.","""I'm back."" Well now I'm back to do another review of the Terminator franchise with Arnold Schwarzenegger returning as the Terminator. With Terminator 2: Judgment Day being so successful and being everyone's favorite Terminator movie and favorite movie of all time in general like mine I've heard that they're going to be doing a third movie. In 1991, there hasn't been a Terminator film for years until 12 years later being called Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines. 10 years after Cyberdyne Systems is been destroyed, John Connor replacing Edward Furlong by Nick Stahl, is a complete mess following the death of his mother, Sarah Connor and is now hiding from the malevolent artificial intelligence Skynet, despite a war between humans and machines not happening in 1997. Skynet sends the T-X back in time to kill one of John's allies in the human resistance. The T-850 Terminator which of course once again played by Arnold Schwarzenegger, is reprogrammed to protect John and his future wife Kate Brewster played by Claire Danes. Okay, when did that happen? When did John Connor started fall in love with Kate Brewster? I have no idea. Maybe the Terminator knows because you know he has detailed files. Kate wants nothing to do with the mission and just wants to get back to her fiancé. But with her fiancé being killed by the T-X, she decides to join in the gig and stop Skynet from starting Judgment Day and defeat the T-X once and for all. Now upon watching the first and second film I'm thinking that after T2, I don't think the other sequels are gonna be as good as the first and the second and boy, was I right. Now not to say that they're all bad, I mean, I've seen Dark Fate in the cinema back in 2019 and I enjoyed it and yeah, I know it bombed at the box office which means there won't be anymore Terminator movies. Now upon seeing them recently I didn't find them to be that bad that is to say that they're both mix bags and now with this movie. This one is okay for what it is. It has Arnold Schwarzenegger coming back and James Cameron is not involved in the franchise after T2 and until Dark Fate making it the first Terminator film which doesn't involved James Cameron. Arnold is just here to say his one-liners and I know he is the king of one-liners like ""I'll be back."" ""Hasta la vista, baby.'' In Rise of the Machines however he his lines like ""Talk to the hand."", ""Don't do that."" ""I'm back."" and ""You are terminated."" The movie itself is similar to Terminator 2: Judgment Day like the action scenes and chases and the whole mission of stopping Skynet from starting Judgment Day all over again is just getting all samey. Even the Terminator is wearing the exact same clothes he took a hairy biker, here however is he took the clothes from a hairy biker who is actually a gay stripper and doing so he put the Elton John glasses which he decides not to wear. And the T-X is the same exact terminator as the T-1000! Earl Boan is back for the last time as Dr. Silberman who tells Kate that he's been in the hostage situation before. I think this is one of the last films that Arnold Schwarzenegger has ever been in since he's moving on to politics but don't worry, as you know when Terminator Genisys and Dark Fate is coming out, you know what he'll say: ""I'll be back."" Yeah, he'll be back. Nick Stahl is okay in his part. He's no John Connor but he did all right for what he brought to the table. Claire Danes as Kate Brewster is just an irritating character. I don't blame Claire Danes performance, it's just that her character is just to create irritation, but after when she finds out that her fiancé is dead, she's not gonna be that irritating anymore. I think you may realise that she's just another Sarah Connor only when she's in the same class in the same school with John Connor. Yeah, how do you like them apples? Now with the T-X in mind, the filmmakers were thinking of going for a female terminator 'cause the previous film has already got a male terminator being a bad guy. Now the movie itself is rated 12 in the UK from where I come from and it's rated R from the US. This I found baffling. Maybe because the violence is being tone down too much to appeal to younger audiences but it doesn't escape the fact that they're going to be put off with the punching through the cop stomach and the Terminator cutting his chest to get the hydrogen fuel cell before it explodes. Yeah, that's a bit much. Don't you think? And the ending is a bit of the let down. Obviously I won't spoil it but I'll let you watch it and you'll see what I mean. So as a Terminator movie this one is quite decent. It's definitely not on to the standards of The Terminator and T2. Seeing what those movies are like in the 80's and 90's, this is all there but in here however it just all seem to mush on it's predecessor. Seeing The Terminator from the 80's this is a fresh start to start the movie. Seeing Terminator 2: Judgment Day from the 90's you will know that this is going to be one hell of a ride to be epic. In here however, this is going to be just a recycled version of Terminator 2 which I will know for an instant is that the franchise is going to be tiring and getting really lacking. This is one of the weakest of this whole franchise with Arnold Schwarzenegger. It lacks any charm that the first and second had. Those two movies that I will watch over and over again. I watch them for about over 100 times and I will continue to watch them until I die. Seeing the other sequels however and honestly reviewing them is a big challenge for me. I don't hold back on how long I'm going to review them even how long this review is which I am doing is all that I'm proud of and still continuing on this day and for now I'm going to end this review and I'll feed my thoughts on the others. So as it is, as far as how many times I'm going to say this is: ""I'll be back.""",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
The 1st in a long line of unwanted sequels,"When Terminator 2 came out Arnold was at the height of his career and the franchise was at an all time high. People had been waiting for the sequel for years and Terminator 2 didn't disappoint.When 3 came out, there wasn't really any high hopes. It came out at a time when there was a ton of unwanted sequels only being made to cash in and this was one of them.The story is completely forced, the actors aren't that good, it lacks character depth, it's poorly written and lifeless. If there was going to be a 3rd movie, it needed to be dark in tone and serious in nature, but instead we get a, ""talk to the hand"" line. This movie suffers from early 2000's comedy in action movies. The comedy is inappropriate for what the movie is supposed to be. We're talking about saving the humane race and Arnold is trying on glasses meant for 70s Elton John.It's not the worst in the series, but close to it. By the time this movie came out I kept thinking why doesn't any one just use some acid on these terminators and a few sequels they finally do. When the holes in the series become obvious, it's time to stop.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Very good summer movie,"I really liked Terminator 3. As a ""Terminator"" fan, though, it would have been better if James Cameron was still on the scene, and how about killing off Sarah Conner?

Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines,"Is it in the song ""American Pie"" where Don McLean sings ""Fire is the Devil's only friend""? Well, I hate to contradict him, but I am afraid time travel is also one of his allies - especially when it is handled in quite such a derivative fashion as this. This time Arnie returns from the future to protect the under-the-radar drifter ""Connor"" (Nick Stahl) and his as yet unknown, future, wife ""Kate"" (Claire Danes) from another, much more state of the art ""Terminator"" - the ""T-X"" (Kristanna Loken). The plot thickens when we discover that her father is an US Air Force general in charge of an whole load of military tech and that baddies Skynet hope to be able to manipulate the past and take control of the defences leaving the nation open to attack from even more of their deadly machines. Could they be re-inventing their own future - on their own, dastardly, terms? Well, of course the original T-1000 (our friendly, neighbourhood, ""Terminator"") is determined to work with ""Connor"" and the now remarkably adept with weaponry ""Kate"" to ensure that this catastrophe is thwarted. Nope, there is not the slightest amount of menace or jeopardy here at all. You might as well just watch the last ten minutes and confirm what you knew was going to happen from the start of this completely unnecessary sequel. The horse has been well and truly flogged; the action scenes - though impressive enough on the VFX front - are all repetitively predictable and frankly rather dull. Neither Stahl nor Danes really fit into their roles particularly well, and strong as he is, Mr. Schwarzenegger can only do so much of the heavy lifting before even his broad shoulders get too tired to prop the whole thing up. Mark Famiglietti provides a bit of eye candy, but otherwise this is all poorly written and delivered, forgettable, stuff that just about passes OK the time in front of the telly.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Terminator 3 An Okay Sc-Fi Film But Flawed,"Terminator 3 Rise of the Machines is a disappointment compared to the sequel that came before it T2 Judgment Day. Terminator 3 is an okay sci-film but flawed in many ways. Director Jonathan Mostow (U571) does a decent job of bringing this movie to the big screen but it could've been a lot better. Some action scenes are cool including a chase sequence early on but the dialgoue at times isn't the greatest which made the movie kind of corny. It's basically the same plot of the first film about a time-traveling terminator whose been sent to protect John Connor from another advanced cyborg except this time it's a woman known as the terminatrix. Whose idea was it to make the villain a female terminator? No offense to Kristina Loken who played the villain because she did do a good job in the movie but I just couldn't buy Skynet creating a female terminator. No offense. Arnold Schwarzenegger returns for the third time as another T-800 sent from the future to protect the soon to be leader of the resistance John Connor. Swarzenegger was born to play The Terminator and does a great job with the role but even he can't help this movie from being a disappointment. His talent and mostly everyone else's is wasted in this third adventure of the Terminator series that's basically the same story of the first two films. It offers nothing really new and besides for some cool action sequences and special effects the movie just isn't that good compared to the other three films. Nick Stahl from Bully and In The Bedroom plays Connor this time taking over for Edward Furlong. Stahl gives a solid performance of an off the grid bum who's running from a destiny he can not escape. Claire Danes from The Mod Squad and Stardust plays Kate Brewster who will eventually become Connor's wife in the future and his second in command. Danes is believable as Kate whose world is turned upside down after she has a chance encounter with Connor. The rest of the cast are good in their roles but this one is the worst of the fourth films in the Terminator series. It's not really that bad as far as the action/fight sequences, special effects, and most of the acting goes it just could've been a lot better at least to me. If you're a fan of these type of films and you haven't seen any other the terminator films yet. I suggest you see either the first one, Judgement Day, or the one that came out most recently Terminator Salvation with Christian Bale and Sam Worthington. Now those three films are worth watching unfortunately I can't say the same for this one.",4.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Rises to the occasion!,"I had low expectations for this film. I thought Nick Stahl would fail as John Connor, Kristanna Loken would fail as a believable villian and the plot would be cheesier than the Hulk's, but I was mistaken about all of the above. The action was up to par with T2, and the plot did not disappoint. The T-X was not as imposing as the T-1000, but still a formidable foe. And although I did not forsee this as a possibility, a Terminator 4 would suit me just fine. It's good to see Arnold back in the saddle.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A shell of its former self,"The first 'Terminator' was basically a sci-fi slasher flick. Dark, relentless and scary. The second one was more cerebral and polished, trading terror for white-knuckle action. 'Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines' is merely a generic summer popcorn movie. The script is thin, recycling old ideas without any of the careful craft that Cameron originally put into them. Also missing is the crucial relationship building that gave the first two films their heart.Arnold returns, looking remarkable for a man in his late 50s, but his Terminator here lacks the cold menace of the original or the sly wit of his 'T2' counterpart. Nick Stahl is surprisingly effective as John Conner, but his character is unfortunately underwritten. ""Heroine"" Claire Danes mostly just screams and villain Kristianna Loken is nothing but eye candy as the eye-rollingly named Terminatrix.Though it breezes by at a fast clip, 'Rise of the Machines' is a weak and uninspired successor to the two legendary originals.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Terminator 3 destroys the franchise,"I was really looking forward to the prospect of a third instalment to the Terminator series, but when i read that it was to be a 12A rating, i was outraged. There's no need for it, is there. If you look at the 3rd movie it tells you all. It has an edgy and out of touch storyline. It's not directed by James Cameron, it was left for 12 years to be revisited, it has no Linda Hamilton, no Edward Furlong(they left it to late for him, not seeing the inevitable, that he would end up in rehab)and the main attraction and the only attraction is a 56 year old Terminator who is on the verge of bowing out of the industry(Arnie). These are not the things that frustrate me in a big way, i'll tell you what it is, it's the films disgraceful attention to detail: 1) Nick Stahl(John Connor) says that the Terminator visited him first when he was 13, when anyone who actually watched T2 will know that John was 10 in the 1995 based Terminator 2, and he would have had to have been 10 because his mother, Sarah fell pregnant with him in late 1984(shown in Terminator). 2) It says on Sarah Connors coffin that she was born in 1959 and died in 1997 from leukaemia. She wasn't born in 1959, she was 19 in 1984, that was explained in T2, she had to be born in 1964 or 1965. 3) John says in T3 that his mother contracted Lukemia in 1994, and died from it shortly after the predicted Judgement Day. Now if that's the case why wasn't this mentioned in 1995 based T2, well i'll tell you why, they didn't expect Linda Hamilton to turn down the 3rd movie role, so they created some bull crap story to cover up her disappearance. I didn't reckon much of Nick Stahl's dry performance and i think that Director Jonathan Mostow & writers John Branicato, Michael Ferris & Tedi Sarafian should give each other some hard slaps and be cast out of the movie making industry for ruining a franchise by making the third instalment having never watched the first two movies. They just wanted to make money, they don't care about those hardcore fans, they don't love films, they mock the industry. 12A gets the kids in, gets the money in, takes the brilliance out.

A Bad Follow-Up To The Best Sequel Ever,"So we're through with T2, probably the best sequel ever came out... Now it's time for the third one in the franchise: Rise Of The Machines. Before watching this film, I took a look at the cast, writers and the director. When I noticed the changes, I knew I'm going to see an average Arnold film. It wasn't better than my expectations, nor was it worse than that. I'm just glad it's not awful. Let's start with the positives first: The directing is pretty great, the script is also good, the dialog was good at best, the action was fantastic and the comedy was well-handled. Now the let's talk about why it's not perfect: Some characters didn't get as much screen time as they should've, the first 40 minutes (!!!) were just an unexplained action exposition, the story wasn't that great, and it was pretty hard to feel bad for their characters, even though we learn about them as the film progresses. Overall, it's a pretty awesome action film. If you're only looking for awesome action scenes and comedy, you won't be disappointed.

Falls Hard.,"A ""Terminator"" film without writer-director James Cameron seemed doomed from the start and sadly the prediction would ultimately become a reality. ""Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines"" picks up several years after the events of the second film and John Connor (Nick Stahl) has become little more than a nomad, constantly moving around because of the fact he does not feel safe anywhere. Even though everything was supposedly solved at the conclusion of ""Terminator 2"", Stahl cannot help but feel that danger still looms. He is of course right as a new terminator (in the form of the strikingly beautiful Kristanna Loken) comes into the picture and chaos strikes. Naturally Arnold Schwarzenegger returns as a re-programmed terminator sent from the future to protect Stahl at all costs. Also along for the ride is engaged veterinarian Claire Danes who has an important role to play in the future. Skynet (ran by David Andrews, who is also Danes' father) is still the governmental entity that must be stopped, altering the future for good. ""Terminator 3"" struggles the whole way through and nearly won me over anyway with fast-paced action and clever one-liners. However, the direction by Jonathan Mostow (a film-maker who does not hold a candle to Cameron) is never very clear and the writing staggers throughout. The final moments of the production are a huge downer too and it is made blatantly clear that there is always a chance for more installments. I was very close to giving ""Terminator 3"" a marginal thumbs up, but the ending was such a mess that it soured me on that notion. Not in the same league with the first installment and not in the same cinematic galaxy as the second. 2.5 out of 5 stars.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Parodies with Alien Series.,"The Terminator series somehow parodies the Alien series. The first two films were amazing pieces of story telling, at different levels. The first one being dark, and edgy. The second to be more mainstream and action orientated. This accounts to both series and the fact that James Cameron is linked as director between these series, is strange also.The difference now is that Alien has made up to 4 sequels, and more coming (so I've heard). Terminator stopped at number 2, till now. Both series had two great starters, and Terminator supposedly stopped at 2, it still had potential to carry on. Hollywood being Hollywood, they decided to do another one. As James Cameron directed both, it would be logical to let him carry the helm for the third time, but he declined.If he declined so would many actors to follow, Linda Hamilton, Edward Furlong, (Though I think they didn't pick him, due to drug offences). Though Arnold Swarzeneggar had to accept for the movie to go ahead, as he was the major star in the last two. Much like Sigourney Weaver in the Alien Series. He had to accept as he hasn't had a hit for a long, long time.Like the alien movies, the standards set were very high, so the next sequel will be hard to impress. For me the third Alien movie, was different and wasn't bad, but compared to the last two it was poor. This is what I feel about Terminator 3: The Rise of the Machines as well.The problem with sequels, is that the audience knows the characters now, therefore people make their own judgement on how that character would react. Which may differ to the director.The story: There is now a new model terminator, a T-X (Kristanna Loken)a more advance terminator than T-1000. Who has been sent back in time out to kill John Connor (Nick Stahl), who is now a lot older from the last outing. T-800 (Arny of course) is also sent back to protect him. Basically the same plot from T2, but there is a difference, T-X is a female and a lot more advanced.My opinion of Skynet is that it would be illogical for them to make a terminator that is female, pretty and I thought they would explain the reason, but do not. For me Kristanna Loken plays a good killer, but it just seemed that Hollywood realised that the market in movies, are stronger women. Which has already been experienced in T2. It just doesn't work for me, though I'm not trying to be sexist.I feel John Connor seemed a little weak for someone, who will lead the last human rebellion to victory. Even Claire Danes character was stronger than him.The overall story destroys the message that was given in T2. Well it is still entertaining, certainly a lot more funnier than the last one. Can't believe it recieved a 12A rating in the UK, so I must insist you don't bring in children to watch this, as there is a certain scene that is quite disturbing.C-",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
An unnecessary sequel,"Everything that needed to be said and done was done so in Terminator 2. (Quite nicely, I might add.) There was absolutely no need to make enough another Terminator movie, proving that T3 was simply nostalgic masturbation on the studio's part.Terminator 3 is basically one big homage to Terminator 2. There's nothing in T3 that wasn't done (and done better) in T2. Cameron clearly had a better handle on the story than Mostow, who spent the whole movie trying to convince the audience that he can throw down with the big boys. Reality, however, is against him, since T3 is nowhere near as entertaining as T2.With the exception of Arnold, T3 has just about everything going against it. Claire Daines looks very out of place in this movie, Nick Stahl is a horrible John Conner, and the two have little to no chemistry together. The special effects are rather sloppy and the music is pretty mediocre. Even the action scenes aren't as good as T2. It's a twenty-first century Terminator film, but we can only have one expensive sequence (the fire truck)?! The one thing I do like about T3 is the notion that Judgment Day is inevitable. Fate is a time-honored and effective plot device, especially in stories involving time travel. While it doesn't even begin to fill in for the rest of what is lacking T3's plot, at least it provides a somewhat stable backbone.On its own, Terminator 3 is an OK movie. It's flawed, but entertaining. In relation to its predecessors, however, it falls flat on its face. It's obvious that it was simply an effort to restart the franchise and keep the money-hose going.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

"Not bad, not as good as hoped","It's been 19 years since The Terminator; 12 years since Terminator 2: Judgement Day. Arnold has gotten older, movie-technology has gotten more advanced, but how does this affect the third installment to the Terminator-epic...?First of all, I'm not gonna be one of those critical souls shouting that this is a poor movie, cause one thing must be clear: Terminator 3: Rise of The Machines is FAR from being poor. The story is still exiting, the special effects are as good as you'd expect, the acting is quite OK. However, T3 leaves you a bit disappointed. There is something lacking despite all the fancy camera-work, the high speed chases, the rough action, basically all the blockbuster eyecandy can't remove the feeling that T3 should have been a little bit...better.While watching T3's two predecessors, there has always been a certain unique atmosphere present; an intense excitement; a sence of impending doom when the Terminator is chasing after it's targeted victim. That very atmosphere was what made both films so very good, together with - of course - very well written scripts, great directing, and awesome soundtracks.T3 has got action sequences which are at times better than the first two movies, with crispier CGI. But that feeling of doom, the terror of the terminator is gone. When Robert Patrick was on screen in T2, you felt an eerie presence of his bad guy-character, the same with Arnold in the first movie.Kristanna Loken who plays the female T-X terminator in T3 is a pretty girl, no doubt about that, but she completely lacks the ability to send out any eerie-vibes what so ever. You just don't feel intimidated by her. Her general performance isn't really good either, and despite the fact that she hardly has any lines, it is all too easy to see that she is no Cate Blanchett when it comes to acting. The rest of the cast do an OK job though, while Claire Danes' ""damsel in distress""-character gets a little annoying at times. I love Arnie in this movie, and it's been a while since I did. His latest movies has been quite disappointing, but in T3 you'll find him back in good old-fashioned style. OK, he's not an Oscar-material actor (never was, never will be), but he IS the Terminator!One of the movies' downfall, is the script. Cause the script for T3 doesn't work as well as the scripts for two first movies did. And while Jonathan Mostow is a talented director (I think both Breakdown and U-571 were good films), he hasn't got the story-telling ability that James Cameron is the master of. Cameron, who directed both the two first Terminator-movies, knows the story better than anyone, and I think he would have been the perfect choice for T3 as well.   But all together, Terminator 3: Rise of The Machines is an enjoyable action-flick, with some very funny moments as well (Especially the ""Talk to the hand""-line from Arnold while walking out of a gas-station without paying for his merchandise). Just a little shame that the movie is not as good you would hope it to be. But maybe a 4th movie will do the series total justice. Atleast the ending sure opens up for a 4th Terminator-epic.I have a feeling that sometime in a not too distant future, Arnie will be back...untill then, I will get out of here!My score for Terminator 3 - Rise of The Machines: 7/10 (T2, the best in the series as I see it, would get 9/10)",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
T3  The first action movie of the new millennium worth seeing.,"I was lucky enough to get a ticket to the Maryland premier of T3: Rise of the Machines'.  WOW!  This is the best action film since the first Matrix'. Maryland residents, SEE THIS AT THE SENATOR.  It will blow you away.The film works on every level.  Good story, acting, action and just enough humor result in a film that lays the 2nd installment to waste.  I am personally glad that James Cameron passed on this project.  His access to unlimited resources will forever tarnish his filmic vision.  Cameron's version of T3 would have been as bloated and worthless as every movie David Selznick made after Gone With the Wind.'  Jonathan Mostow created a sequel that is true to the original and less than 2 hours long.Yes, the budget was huge for T3, but it works and has the most plausible plot of the three films.  After accepting the existence of nearly indestructible terminators, everything else falls into place.  Controlled, limited CGI and muted special effects made every sequence believable (note to the Matrix 2 screenwriters  even though it was really cool, you will never, ever see two tractor trailers worth of Ducatis on the highway at the same time).  The action sequences were not to long (hello Matrix 2 writers). The resulting realism fuels total viewer immersion.  Suspension of disbelief was never pushed too far.  As a result, the audience reacts positively to what was happening on the screen.Less CGI places a greater role on the actors and they did not disappoint. The characters related to each other in a believable manner.  There were no huge plausibility issues (John Conner doesn't send his dad back in time to impregnate his mother a.k.a. T1).  The writers developed a great inevitability of fate' angle to help the story along.  Sarah Conner reaches out from the grave to lend support and the annoying psychologist from the first film returns for a cameo.  The Terminatrix, who attacks with the tenacity and brutality of a woman scorned, is the perfect foe for Arnold. Arnold's one-liners are nicely spaced, a riot and help balance out the insane barrage of destruction the terminators leave in their wake.T3 also stands on it's own.  It needs no help from its predecessors (unlike Matrix 3'). The machines rise, as the title suggests, so if there is a T4, it will either be a prequel or take place in the post-human, Skynet world.  There is no need for a prequel as T3 provides a perfect conclusion to the `human-controlled' portion of the saga.  Don't expect a cheesy thumbs-up, into the smelter T2 ending.  The audience I was with applauded the movie as the credits rolled and I was right there clapping along side them.Don't cheat yourself.

Yes, that really could be it. Was the self-irony in T2 not the exact right amount and tone? Did anyone want what this had in that area? Even if you do laugh at the initial sunglasses bit, you're likely to, a second or so later, go ""wait a minute..."", and that's not the last of it. Add to that, there is a Road Runner gag in this. You think I'm kidding? Check for yourself, around half an hour in. The ""humor"" largely consists of stupid stereotypes, trying to get cheap laughs. No... in truth, I know what this is. A popcorn flick. And it shouldn't be. Like its predecessors, it's got action, and it's big. Unfortunately, now you can also add ""dumb"" and ""loud"" to that description, and that does not belong in the universe of these. You want that type of cinema experience? Heck, go for it. I do, too. But that is not what this franchise is. The shoot-outs and car-chases are simply not that exciting, and every time this tries to recreate or mimic something in one of the previous entries, it's awful at worst, and dull, never reaching the height of them, at best. The script is daft. It holds a handful of interesting concepts or ideas, however, none are terribly utilized or followed through. More noticeable are the times that the writing is convenient. And somehow, after a kind of light, easy to take in running time, this ends in a depressing(not to mention abrupt, unsatisfying and pointless) way(sadly, Boen's role in this can be described that way, as well). I agree with what Hamilton said when she declined this. You can tell James Cameron had no direct hand in this. I will say that the effects are mostly well-done, though a few are hideous. The character of Kate was annoying and unnecessary. John manages to have a higher pitched voice than he did as a 13-year-old(!) at times in this. The acting varies, it's not all bad. The leads do convincingly(fingers ought to be pointed at the screenplay, instead). They didn't particularly think of anything new for the the cyborg. And before anyone asks if I could come up with such, hey, maybe not, meanwhile, you do not see me going out and making a sequel to T1 and 2. Kristanna did give this an effort, and clearly got into it, and the fault does not lie with her. The T-X is instantly and infinitely obvious in why that was their choice. Did they have to stoop to that level? There are at least three separate occurrences that were put there for no other purpose than to attract male teenagers, and could be taken out with no loss to the rest of it(the key-words give clues). Thus this is the first of these to have aspects that are gratuitous. The sexuality, the nudity, the language, the violence, heck, the whole bloody thing. Apart from cashing in, why was this released? The DVD has some specials, including a marvelous documentary, outtakes(fairly low on the list of hilarity-to-length ratio, if you ask me), featurettes(one with Todd MacFarlane, who is a blast to listen to and view), a commentary track(they're informative enough) with only Mostow, and one where he's joined by Arnie, Stahl, Danes and Loken(although they're recorded separately, so there is little to no back-and-forth). For that last one, I'd go with the Director's Cut of Judgment Day's, instead: The track for that is an interesting case... it contains almost thirty(!) people, and while that obviously seems quite bombastic, it's handled well. There is a main speaker, and it would appear that everyone else who says anything has done so in interviews, and the parts that fit with specific stuff(shots, sounds, effects) are then put in here, briefly introduced(occasionally after they've already spoken) by the... producer or who it was. I'd give that a listen if you care for such. Back to what there is on the discs of this...They range in quality, but I'd say that the one that stands out, to me, anyway, the sole thing that even begins to justify the existence of this, is the Sgt. Candy Scene. I'd watch that even if you have no other contact with this. I recommend this to those not attached in any way to the prior movies that share a title with this, and/or people looking for something to turn their brain off to. I don't have a problem with entertainment pieces of that sort come to be, nor that they sell(again, I am one of the buyers), I merely object to using this established name for that. 5/10",5.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Maybe part 4 will be better,"I came into this movie looking for a post apocalyptic fight against robots. I would have loved for the movie to open with Armageddon.   Nope, it was not like that.  It ended up being about the pre-apocalypse.   Once again Terminator robots are sent to the past to terminate John Conner and his future helpers.  In other words this movie is exactly like T2, but the only difference is they chase John 10-15 years later.  Instead of trying to kill his mom, they are trying to kill his future wife.That is kind of disappointing.  I really would have loved to see John fight the robots in the future.  Well hopefully James Cameron will be brought on to direct T4, The final battle.The movie itself was a great action picture.  The special effects were awesome.  Very memorable was the chase scene involving a crane, a motorcycle, police cars, ambulance, and a fire engine.Question how did the female terminator control the vehicles during the chase scene?  A car's acceleration and braking is not computer controlled.  In the movie you see the gas pedal being pressed down by the terminator even though she is not in the car.8.5/10 (I only gave a high review because of great special effects), but then again I am the drunken_critic.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Not a worthy sequel.,"T3 is more of an attempt to simply do a sequel for money. The plot line is fairly convoluted and seems more like the second part in a trilogy.Arnold is simply Arnold. He is okay, the action is as expected, lines seems more forced and the writing is not as witty as T2. Nick Stahl seems more like a TV actor and doesn't have the anger that Eddie Furlong portrayed in T2. Claire Danes does a decent job as his future spouse. Kristanna Loken as T-X is a little confusing as a character and a Terminator. Is she an improvement? She has more mechanical breakdowns than the T-1000 series. She is a babe. She tries to be icy like Robert Patrick did in T2, but to me she needs more training.My major beef about the movie is some obvious script flaws. Claire's father is in charge of an secret Air Force research lab and she along with John Conner and Arnold manage to simply waltz into this facility without even a glitch, loaded with weapons and explosives. Good security, especially in the times we live in now.The other downer is the end. How can the future be written in stone. I find this extremely unbelievable that not one thing all these people do, doesn't appear to change one thing in the future time line.I wish James Cameron was involved with this project. He is a much better writer/director for this type of genre.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Pointless in every way other than a financial one,"STAR RATING:*****Unmissable****Very Good***Okay**You Could Go Out For A Meal Instead*Avoid At All CostsT3 is a belated prequel to the 1991 sequel,also starring Arnold Schwarzenegger.Returning to the role that set him on the road to international superstardom,Arnie here reprises his role as the machovelian Terminator.It's hard to say whether or not the first two films director,James Cameron,had it in mind to make this third instalment,or whether this is yet another idea for a movie thought up by unimaginative Hollywood execs unable to come up with original ideas and so just resorting to resurrecting long dormant franchises (although the first sequel did come seven years after the original).But all the same,he isn't and in his place,we have Breakdown helmer Johnathon Mostow.Whether or not this is because Cameron was dissatisfied with the outcome of the script is unknown,but Mostow is a competent enough director as his past efforts have shown.One thing his film is lacking,though, that was dominating Cameron's first two and pretty much made them indistinguishable,is the dark feel that set the scene,in it's place a more lively,jolty feel that will either make or break the film for you.Although,the film's plot just seems like a rehash of the last one with a few things thrown in for window dressing.It's also got to contend with underwhelming set pieces,lifeless humour and rather unappealing dialogue.There are some clever ideas here and there (which are never explored to their full potential though) and there is the gorgeous Kristanna Lokken to add eye candy to the proceedings (she can come and terminate me any day).But overall it has to be described as a rather pointless experience that's box office performance will probably warrant a follow up but which certainly doesn't get your appetite wetted for it's arrival.**",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Run!,"" but other parts make up for it. The unexpected and well-timed humor brought theater-filling laughs from the crowd.

Brilliance is irrelevant; a serviceable action film.,"Given all the impropitious factors that were stacked against this latest installment I think the film works reasonably well and has at least the visceral appeal that a 170 million dollar blockbuster should have. Yes it lacks the artistry and elan that Cameron brought to the first two installments and yes it does simply rehash and expand previous action sequences that made the first two films so enjoyable. However I found the acting to be serviceable and the human element was palpable enough to the point where it did not feel like a completely boneheaded action film. My main qualm with the characters was with the TX who was not fleshed out enough and not nearly as menacing as the T-1000 from the second film. The majority of the action sequences serve to simply entertain us and do so in spades. However they were also a way to mask the fact that the story was incredibly thin and the dialogue laconic and derivative of the popular catch phrases established in the first two films. But in conclusion it must be noted that outside of the context of the first two films this is a summer action movie that entertains and even makes fun of itself to the joy of the viewer. The action thankfully does not really too heavily on CGI effects and ends up boing much more entertaining than 'The Matrix Reloaded' or 'The Hulk' by action standards. Compared with the first two films it is no more than a road movie with action sequences and minimal sci-fi elements thrown in. Not entirely forgettable but the second one is still by far the finest of the three. 6 out of 10, worth a look for entertainment purposes.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Someone pointed the camera at the wrong place, at the wrong time.","Dear god, this film is just beyond word. It has no need to have ever been made after terminator 2, which was good. The way they explain why the war wasn't stopped... really wasn't an explanation at all ""judgement day is inevitable"". Well, how scientific, i didn't know Jonathan Mostow put so much thought in to it there. Arnold acting in this is worse then usual, like you ever thought that possible. The CGI is credible, but not nearly enough to save this doomed film. After terminator 2, the story ended with a sense of ambiguity, almost to give the film a more realistic edge, what the screen doesn't show me, my mind makes it more powerful by imagining the outcome. The creation of this movie has ruined this mental picture, and ruined the last shred of Arnold Schwarzeneggers dignity. At least in the other films he was cool and hard, they ruined it by adding the comedy aspect (you all know what i'm talking about). Why did James Cameron let this complete idiot tamper with his finished project? There was no need for a third film, let it go. Do not see this film!!!",1.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Terminator is back on top!,"It was pretty good.  Some will fault T3 because of the lacking of some characters, but it does not hurt this film.  It has more plot than T1, or T2 combined.The lack of Cameron does not bother me at all.  It also has several twists that give it more depth than the previous Terminator movies.  The special effects were great, well above the Matrix movies if you ask me.  CGI use was nice and not overdone.Arnold is back in top shape for this one as well.  I really hope we see a T4.  I think it was not a good time to release T3.  My theatre was pretty empty on Friday night (the 4th of July).  I think a lot of people were out to other Holiday parties.

"The Sequel That Is Action, And Not Much Else","I have always been a fan of the Terminator movies, and when I first heard they were doing a third, I couldn't help but be disappointed. Strike One. Then the news hit me that James Cameron opted out on this movie. Strike Two. Then I actually saw the movie. Strike three, Hollywood sucks!First, there is almost no resemblance between T3 and its predecessors, plot wise. Here there is enough plot to satisfy your typical big-budget summer movie. Yet there were enough continuity and plot holes that I felt empty myself. I've had bowel movements more satisfying than the plot of this movie, which absolutely destroys the beauty of ""There is no fate but what we make for ourselves."" But for the masses, this is the movie of the summer. It's all action and forced humor. The entrance of Arnold was not entertaining, nor was him using ""Talk to the hand."" Ick...Acting...well, it wasn't as bad as ""Battlefield Earth"" but it wasn't good either. Kristianna Loken is a pretty face, and she is nowhere near as frightening and creepy as Robert Patrick. But he also had a score that made him creepy. Arnold is back to what he did well once, but that is no longer there. Here, he tries to channel the Arnold of T2, and fails. Nick Stahl wasn't a bad choice, and continuity wise, I'm glad they chose him instead of Edward Furlong. Furlong just doesn't have the charisma or brooding sense that Nick Stahl brought to John Connor's role. Claire Danes, forgettable, just like the minor characters that pop up here and there.The humor...wasn't funny. Trying to make Arnold into a comedian is nearly as bad as making Gimli a comedian. It doesn't fit, it isn't funny, and most of all, it made me want to vomit.The action is where this movie shines, and that's it. The car chase is phenominal. The fights between the TX and the T800, uh, T101...??? (it was T-800, Cyberdyne Systems Model 101 in the previous films) are very cool. All in all, the action makes this movie.For being an all-round disappointment for me, it was entertaining. But now my dwindling faith in Hollywood has vanished.

I am however a hardcore fan but I don't consider this movie as an insult. For me the problem was that this film basically ignores the first two films. It's like the The Exorcist: The Heretic, it completely ignores the main events of the first part. If you are going to make a sequel, make sure that you include the events in the first part. Aliens did but again it was an action movie, not a Sci-Fi horror film like the first part was. Plus I think it was a good idea to have a female antagonist but it doesn't mean anything if she does the same thing over & over again. T-1000 from Judgement Day didn't do the same thing like T-800 did in the first Terminator film. All in all though, it might be a good film for some others but not hardcore fan.",4.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Hasta la vista, Arnie","The first two ""Terminator"" films were classics and, given the disappointments of Arnold Schwarzenegger's more recent movies (such as ""End Of Days"" and ""The Sixth Day""), it was obviously enormously tempting to return to his most famous and iconic role, even after an interval of 12 years. But it was a wise decision - Arnie has shaped up (literally) and cleaned up at the box office in a return to form that might yet prove to be a platform to political success that terminates his 'acting' career.Director James Cameron has now left the scene and his role is taken over by Jonathan Mostow who - as we know from the history-twisting, but action-laded ""U-571"" - is a competent producer of exciting movies. Like all sequels, ""T3"" is formulaic -a repetition of the key elements of earlier movies in the franchise with a few variations. But it is a winning formula and the obligatory road chase sequence is really well done, while the main twist - a female terminator - works effectively with Kristanna Loken looking chillingly attractive. I especially enjoyed the use of new machines.There is no real plot or character development, but the storyline remains honest to the original premise that Armageddon is inevitable. Above all, it thoroughly entertaining as, as Arnie comments at one point: ""Your levity is good - it relieves tension and the fear of death"". A couple of lines leave open a possible return to the franchise and, since terminators obviously come in many forms, this could even happen without Arnie if he proves to be busy running California. One way or another, I'm convinced he'll be back.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A worthy continuation of the Apocalypse,"I was fully expecting to be disappointed with this film, especially after what I considered the existential failure of ""The Matrix: Reloaded,"" earlier this year. Pleasantly, I was not. Any movie that starts off with a nuclear bang is okay in my book, and things picked up nicely thereafter.Arnold does the thing he does best (laconic one-liners), Nick Stahl is a suitable replacement for Ed Furlong (mostly due to decent acting chops and a certain resemblance to Michael Biehn), the effects are pretty much flawless, the chase sequences rock, the Terminatrix is a satisfying upgrade from the T-1000, and the ending is not only a darkly enjoyable conclusion to the (relatively thin) plot (which is pretty much a retread of ""Terminator 2: Judgment Day"" minus Sarah Connor), it leaves things nicely open-ended for yet another sequel. I left the theater feeling that I got my money's worth; what more can you ask?My only complaints would center on the script's reliance on a number of coincidences that raise the eyebrow of believability (including the otherwise enjoyable cameo appearance of Dr. Silverman), and what I felt was the miscasting of Claire Danes. I'm not sure why I felt that way, as I consider her to be a gifted actor, but she just rubbed me the wrong way. I suppose repeated viewings will soften my opinion, perhaps. (3/10/07 edit: I just learned that Sophia ""The Hitcher"" Bush was originally cast in Danes' role, but was let go shortly after production began because the director felt she was too young. One can only wonder how this film would have fared thus cast...)Nutshell opinion: T3 moves the franchise forward with workmanlike style and panache, and leaves the viewer anticipating the next chapter. My hope is that when ""T4"" rolls around, we get to see Arnold playing the human being upon whom his Terminator was modeled.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

An above average action flick that embarrasses the franchise,"T3 is a pretty good action movie with enough destruction to sustain the movie.  But, the movie falls much short of the epic scope which was provided by T1 and T2.  Jonathon Mostow does a commendable job of keeping the pacing tight and action high, but does very little with the story line.  It is essentially a retread of T2.In addition, I can forgive Mostow for using way too many absurd jokes at the expense of the Terminator in order to get a few chuckles from the audience.(Talk to the hand?!!  Elton John glasses?!!)I don't think there could have been a better action movie made than T2. The only man who could have attempted to undertake T3 and make it as good as its predecessors would have to be James Cameron.  But I believe Cameron opted out because he knew himself he could not do it and did not want to dissapoint the audience.On the plus side, the movie does seem to get better and better as you progress to the end.  The crane action stunt is absolutely amazing.  And we have to mention Arnie.  The man is and forever will be remembered as the Terminator. The TX again is a passable advesary, but Robert Patrick's T1000 will be remembered as the best villian from the Terminator series.I think this movie is definitely a rental. Not much on the DVD and the flick does not warrant multilple viewings ala T2.  I am sure there will be some sort of triple deluxe super edition in a couple of years just in time for Governor Arnie to make a come back in T4 fresh in his Golden years.6/10 /mb",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Men and their 'Machines'.,"My Take: Lacks the originality of the first or the thrills of the second, but effective all the same.Third chapters are usually gamble, especially if you have a series that's as successful as the TERMINATOR saga. What started as a hit low-budget sci-fi thriller (in THE TERMINATOR) turns into one of the most explosive and expensive blockbuster of all time (in TERMINATOR 2: JUDGMENT DAY). So what is there in store for audiences in TERMINATOR 3: RISE OF THE MACHINES. Not to terribly much I'm afraid, as the film falls under the category of ""been-there-done-that"" for most of the scenes. Director James Cameron unfortunately leaves further involvement in this third film, and leaves the directorial reigns (as well much of the TERMINATOR legacy) to action director Jonathan Mostow, who isn't exactly a brand name a director. The new story (helmed by new batch of writers who are everything but James Cameron and Gale Ann Hurd).But regardless of its shortcomings, TERMINATOR 3 isn't a total loss as it might have turned out. While he rushes the screenplay for production, Mostow does offer a nicely done batch of action sequences and nifty special effects to keep one busy. There's much action here to satisfy the conventional action fan, be it chase scenes or wild gun-play action (maybe even both in one scene). Arnold Schwarzenegger (before running for governor of California) returns as the ever-present emotionless futuristic cyborg once again sent to protect John Conner (Nick Stahl), now a messed-up drifter, from yet another mechanical creation from Skynet sent to the past to kill him. For a change (whilst not much), the new machine, called the T-X, is takes the form of a chick (played by Kristanna Loken), which is just as unstoppable as its predecessor, other than that there's very little else new nor interestingly unique about this new killing machine. In addition, the big bad machine from the violent future must also protect Conner's would be wife (played by Claire Danes). Their connections with each other? They were classmates once! It doesn't get much more complicated than that, now does it? While the writing leaves much to be desired, and its anticlimax of an ending (of an anticlimax of a sequel by the way!) leaves us wondering why we had to go through the events of this film in the first place. One more thing, the much beloved characters of the ass-kicking woman warrior Sarah Conner is sorrily missed, almost as much as a payoff to the character of John Conner, who is a disappointment here in this film. Still, nonetheless, TERMINATOR 3 is a decent action thriller, packed with action and thrills. Leave our cynicism and brains at the door, it's brainless summer season again, and TERMINATOR 3 is a decent effort of pure mainstream film-making. It's disappointing, but only as sequel.Rating: *** out of 5.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Underrated,"Terminator 3 (2003)*** 1/2 (out of 4)With Judgment Day looming, another Terminator (again played by Schwarzenegger) is sent back in time to protect John Connor (Nick Stahl) who is now a pill taking junkie. The two must also protect another woman (Claire Danes) from a new form of killer in the T-X. This third film in the series gets mostly mixed reviews but I found it to be the perfect way to end the original series and a great way to start up the battle of the future. The movie has some flaws in it but overall this is everything a summer blockbuster should be. We get some nice characters, good laughs and plenty of non-stop action but we also get a good story thrown in as well. I do think the story is a step down from the previous film but then again so is everything in this movie. It certainly doesn't live up to the previous film but not too many can so that's not a reason to bash this one. In terms of action this thing is a homerun as we get one great sequence after another. The highlight of the movie has to be the crane sequence where Schwarzenegger gets attached to it and they make for some great damage. This entire sequence is jaw dropping and really packs a terrific punch in terms of action. I also loved what they did with the ending. I certainly won't ruin what happens but I thought it was handled in a very good way and didn't pull any strings. The one flaw in the movie is Stahl and Danes. Both are fine actors and both are fine here but to me we needed people a little stronger or perhaps their characters should have just been written better. Schwarzenegger is in good form and has plenty of nice one-liners as well. I'm not sure if this will ever gain the classic status of the previous two films but it's a good way to end the original series and we'll just have to see what the future films, taking place in the future, holds.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Alot of people have complained that there are too many plot holes, but there are no fewer plot holes than that of its 2 predecessors. The screenwriters and Mostow handled the continuation of T2 well. Don't get me wrong, this movie has its flaws, and YES James Camerons touch is missing, but does that make it a bad movie? No. 12 years is a long time to make a sequel, and based off of how poor some sequels are, I'm glad this one ended up a winner, box-office wise and critic wise.

Doesn't compare to previous parts,"The moment they approved the script this movie was doomed. Choosing a no-name director was perhaps the biggest mistake as one of the greats like Ridley Scott or James Cameron could still have saved to movie.

There are some nice effects in some parts but most of the time it's just annoying. There's nothing original about it. I'd recommend watching Cypher instead but you'll probably want to see T3 anyway just for the sake of it (just like the creators counted you would). I'm betting there's going to be part 4 in the series as well and it will suck just as bad as Alien: Resurrection sucked.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
What a waste!,"As a HUGE fan of the previous Terminator films, I eagerly awaited this installment.  Although, as the release date loomed closer, I began having low expectations for the film.  Simply because T2 was so incredible.  It was an action film, but not JUST an action film.  The action was placed in a story about morality, human relationships, fate, and the possible dangers of the advancement of technology.While T2 succeeded on many levels, T3 succeeds in none.  From beginning to end, I was just sitting there hoping it would get better.  John Connor's opening narration/update made me sick to my stomach - Just start the story already!The acting was terrible from the entire ensemble.  Kristanna Loken played her part like she was slapped in the middle of a B horror flick, Nick Stahl was weak, and Claire Danes (who I usually really like) seemed to have nothing to do but scream the entire time.The writing was awful, making this an ""ending"" to T2 that just was not necessary.  Character development was pushed to the back-burner, as John Connor's character even regressed at one point.  The action had the distinct feeling of having been done before.T3 belongs right next to Mostow's other waste, U-571.  In the trash. 1/10...........only because I could not give it a 0",1.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Awesome Action & Villian, Great Ending, Good Story","Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines, is in my opinion, very well done. It combines the most intense action sequences that I have ever seen along with some good characters and a pretty well thought out plot. The acting: Overall, I would have to say the acting was good. Nothing great, but good for an Action/Sci-Fi movie. Nick Stahl's performance was fine, nothing to over-criticize. His performance as the older, 20-something year old John Conner has made some fans of the series a little angry at how different his John Conner is compared to T2's Edward Furlong's. First of all, I think they are both good actors and I probably would have rather seen Edward Furlong reprise his role as John Conner in the third film, but Nick Stahl did good. I also tend to agree to some extent the characteristic differences between the two Conners, but the only explanation that I can give is that going through a life-changing experience like Furlong's bad-ass Conner did in T2, can change your personality throughout your life, especially when you know the world is in your hands. So maybe the new Director, who also did a awesome job to fill in for Cameron, wanted the new Conner to act the way he did. Claire Danes was very good in my opinion as Kate Brewster, her first action role. Some critics and fans panned her performance and her character because they said she was just the girl who `screamed at everything.' Well, maybe she did, but at least she brought some of the only emotion from all the actors in the film. Arnold is Arnold. He will never be able to get away from Terminator, no matter what film he is cast in. It will always be compared to Terminator. He is in excellent physical condition for his age (56?). Kristanna Loken was exceptionally villainous as the new T-X evil Terminator, and extremely hot. Many people don't realize how hard it can be to be kicked, punched, and hit over the head (even if it isn't hard) and not flinch. Her face stayed emotionless and calm, exactly how a terminator should act. A few times she smiled, but that only added to her evilness. Although her character isn't nearly as terrifying as Robert Patrick's T-1000 in T2, she definitely added some presence onscreen. The Story: Overall, the story was good. Some stuff evolved from the previous two films and some other things contradicted them. I would definitely have liked it to be a little longer. But I have to say that I liked the fact that Jonathan Mostow took a different approach than Cameron by going straight to the action, and staying there the entire time. That is much different than Cameron's Action, Drama, Action direction from T2. Mostow had massive shoes to fill, and he filled them quite well. I loved the action scenes, because even though a large amount of special effects were used, they weren't the main object in each scene, like in Attack of the Clones. Many people are calling the effects mediocre, and nothing compared to T2's groundbreaking, Oscar-winning effects. Well, he knew he wouldn't live up to the effects, because basically, there was no more ground to break in the Visual Effects world, so he decided to take a different approach to the action scenes. And it paid off, for me at least. There is one scene that is possibly one of the best action-chase scenes that I have ever seen in a movie. All I will say is that it involves a massive crane truck, a Toyota Tundra, a motorcycle, a fire truck, and many `undriven' police cars. Awesome scene, and one of the best parts of the movie. All in all, great movie and if you're a fan of action or Sci-fi, you'll like it. Just don't think too much of it like a die-hard Terminator fan, or else you'll get to confused. ***1/2/****",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
the right notes,"Though not any kind of masterpiece, T3 brings an effective closure to the trilogy (let us pray that T4 never happens) and was a better movie than I thought it would be.The scope is on the slightly more human scale of the first movie. Of course there are obscene levels of stunts and special effects, but what drew me in was that the notions of fate and consequence were dealt with in a more  - dare I use the word - realistic manner. The sheer terror of the first movie and the operatic melodrama of the second have been brought down to a more plausible scale. One gets more of the feeling that the two human principles are real people. Their flaws are not gigantic tragic flaws, but real qualities of fear, bravery, uncertainty, and shock. This gives more drama and entertainment in their interactions with the two machines.For it's back to basics philosophy and high entertainment value I give it a solid 8/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Brings joy and excitement, but probably the weakest in the franchise.","The third instalment in the series brings you Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines. Schwarzenegger returns as the T-850, as he battles the T-X whilst trying to stop Judgment Day from happening, along with teaming up with an adult John Connor.It brings interesting depth and the hype is still enjoyable, but it does not show the excitement and thrilling enjoyment from its two previous instalments. Still an enjoyable movie to watch, Arni still carry's the titular character into groundbreaking heights.",5.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
For me the series goes from best to the worst (but still good!),"This is a definite return to form for Arnie and his first box office hit (maybe, depending on the drop off) and critical hit since ironically his last outing as the T-800, in T2. Yes True Lies was a box office hit but critically the response was very mixed, although fairly good in Britain. This is also his best since True Lies, it has more in the way of story but the action doesn't quite come up to Jim Cameron standard (little does!).Before going on about the strengths of this film I'll comment on the weaknesses. The film has a lot to live up to, and in the end fails to live up to the first two films, while it is still a worthy sequel. Some of the significant weaknesses are the fact that the story is not as interesting or clever, it doesn't have as much character development, although in John's case it does however the other roles are weaker than Sarah Conner and previously Kyle Reese. There is only one prominent 3 dimensional role. As I say Claire Dane's role as Kate Brewster is underwritten and subsequently she is wasted, for instance her fiance is killed by the TX and it has little effect on her, it is not touched upon and is forgotten within five minutes, then the developing relationship between her and John gives her an air of coldness. The thrills lack the excitement and punch of the first two, which is not to say they aren't exciting, but hey its up against Jim. The final action scene is the weakest of all three films and is semi rehashed from the first film. The main problem is that the humour of the film is not as subtle as number 1 or two. It seems that as the franchise has moved along the humour has increased, but here it is bordering on spoof.Another key problem is that Arnie no longer is the head of the movie, he doesn't command the screen like he used to, and his role seems to be that of the Terminator doing an impression of the Terminator, funny as it is to see him send himself up slightly, the humour is far to overt and corny. There doesn't seem to be a need for Arnies character in this one (in terms of the way it is written rather than his overall impact in the story, he still has to save them but aside from that his presence is solely about laughs), the TX is a great adversary and once again Arnie plays protector but his role still wasn't 100% pivotal. T1 and T2 with no Arnold and they would be half of what they are, he held the movies together, his role is written with so much comedy involved that he seems like a caricature, it thankfully doesn't affect his dramatic moments too much though. Some other problems are the disappointing impact of Arnies change from good to bad, this could have been much more exciting, in the end it is very brief and lacks punch. Also the future war scenes that gathered much fan interest before the films release are very small and no more than the first two films, I would liked to have seen more because the idea excited me, that is not too big a problem though as it is bound to happen in the next instalment. To round it off into one sentence, it doesn't feel like the Terminator films that Jim Cameron weaned us on! Also Beltrami's score isn't as memorable as the synthy resonance of Brad Fiedels scores. The score seemed fairly cliched and not as inspirational as some of Marcos other work.Okay my disappointments out the way, and I was a little disappointed at the film considering the early reviews suggested it was going to be very, very good, I found much to enjoy. John Connors role is good and Nick Stahl plays it well, in fact he holds the movie, and this is vital considering the minimal scripting of the other characters, mind you the major focus on him is warranted of course. The action is good, a little over hyped maybe, such as the supposed 15 minute car chase that must have been 5 at most. Even though the film doesn't seem like a 200 million budget there is still plenty of bang for your buck. The TX rocks. Kristanna Loken looks amazing and she looks like a bad ass bitch, she has made a great movement of her own for the TX. She overdoes it at times but she really steals the movie and steals Arnies thunder. The script is pretty good, especially compared to most actioners, it does suffer from some bad dialogue but even the classic first two films had its moments, what action film doesn't? Of course one of the main things was that it was great to see Arnie back in a big action movie kicking some ass, delivering zingers (that were very Commando, very True Lies, a bit too hokey for the Terminators, but still funny) and handling large weaponry, who else but Arnold could walk out with a coffin full of weapons on one shoulder and a large calibre weapon in the other hand and single handedly  wipe out a squad of police vehicles. With a 150 (at least) plus gross under his belt he now will have better options open to him rather than pap like Collateral Damage. There are smiles on the faces of Ah-nuld fans once more with his first truly decent film in nearly ten years (I don't care what critics say True Lies was the dogs bollocks in terms of mindless fun). T3 will be a worthy edition to any action fans DVD collection, and despite Mostow perhaps overstretching himself, going from a 40 million to a 200 million budget production, he is still looking like a top new director coming through, although as its only his third big film in 6 years he needs to accelerate the releases. Most definitely a worthwhile sequel but it falls far short of the first two. Bring on number 4 baby. ***1/2",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Not a scratch on the originals, but T3 rounds off the trilogy nicely","Firstly I'd like to say I'm a huge fan of Terminator and T2, unfortunately T3 is worlds away from the quality of them. It's not an easy task to live up to two of the best sci-fi films ever. However, that doesn't mean it isn't worth a look because there is a lot to like.Jonathan Mostow takes over from James Cameron in this installment and deserves big credit for carrying on the Terminator journey well and creating exiting action along the way. Some of the set pieces are breathtaking, including a brilliant fight that involves a crane and the graveyard scene is very good as well. In the action stakes, not much more could have been asked for is probably the films best strength.As for the casting, I'm sorry to say that its mostly bad news. Arnie seems too old and didn't have the same impact on me as he did in the previous films. He looks a little bit out of place in some of the action scenes as well. The T-X, played by Kristanna Loken is OK but by the far the weakest villain of the trilogy. Loken is not bad in the role but the character could have been much better. Claire Danes as Kate Brewster seems out of place and is definitely miscast. But there is Salvation (ha!), Nick Stahl is excellent as John Connor and carries on from Edward Furlong easily. I was disappointed not to see Furlong back as he was brilliant in T2 but Stahl is good and was unlucky not to be offered to reprise his role for Terminator Salvation (you can hardly argue with Christian Bale though).Overall, Terminator 3 is an above average action film and packs some great action into the running time and has an interesting plot with a few surprises I didn't see coming. Another high point is the excellent, downbeat ending that leaves you wanting more. Don't expect another film as good as Terminator or T2 because you will be disappointed, just enjoy the thrills, the story and the excellent action.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
The non-Arnie scenes are a total drag. Good thing he's in quite a few.,"Is it a fluke that Arnie appeared in arguably half a dozen of the best action flicks in a decade? Was Arnie simply handed all the best roles? Was he given a free ride? Was he unbelievably lucky? Or is he actually a credible leading man and commanding screen presence?I think the answer for me came when I watched T3 last week. About half way through I realised what a dud movie this was in almost every sans-Arnie scene. His Terminator arrives maybe a third of the way in, and as a one guy audience the only thing that allows you to remain involved is knowing he's coming, when he departs proceedings it's 100% dullsville from there.+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++Like many inferior sequels the film opens with a brief narration that serves as a recap for any action fan living under a rock for 20 years – in the future robots send back a cyborg assassin to kill a boy / young man named John Connor destined to become the fearless leader of humankind hellbent on fighting the robot occupation repeatedly.The first time the cyborg was Arnie. The second time it was a slick liquid metal cyborg and the obsolete Arnie was reprogrammed to defend Connor. This time Arnie is once again the protector and the assassin is once again liquid metal, but this time the assassin is a hot chick – and she has wayyyy more toys and tricks than previous Terminators.The rest is a carbon copy of T2 really, only 10 years on. Nick Stahl as John Connor is serviceable but he either did the steely-determined thing very well or he simply lacks personality, his future love interest Kathryn is played by the huge-eyed Claire Danes, the psychiatrist is back once again to continue his running joke – but aside from all that it is Arnie standing in front of a relentless killing machine for 2 hours.That isn't to say that the film is without merit, it tackles the responsibility of copying a classic very seriously, but when you are taking on one of the best 4 or 5 films in history that's a pretty tall order.+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ So after Kristina Lokken appears – naked – as the female Terminator (needless to say if she remained naked they would have sold millions more DVDs, she is a well built cyborg) she instantly sets about killing off various members of the resistance, who are all in their teens or early 20s at this stage. Lokken's Terminator is again liquid metal but this time can produce a veritable handyman's arsenal of tools and weapons, including a big f-you cannon from her arm.Arnold arrives in the desert a short while later, and the two set about punching and shooting at each other all over the very state that Arnold would eventually lead.I must admit that the first big chase is worthy of direct comparison with almost anything from T2, there are remote controlled cop cars, ambulances, a big mobile crane – which Arnold spends a great deal of time hanging off – and even a fire engine. It is a three year old boy's toyset on the bigscreen (my 3 year old actually does plays with all those things). The scene itself runs for maybe 10 minutes, it has the requisite ""big"" explosions and collisions, showcases the new lady-Terminator's abilities and Arnie's dogged determination, and best of all it all seems quite dangerous. Too often now chase scenes are just the lazy action-filler in films, there is little in the way of adrenaline or the perception of peril, the fact that this scene was so outstanding perhaps makes the rest of the film look a little shabbier by comparison.After a couple more not quite so good chases and a shootout in a cemetery (which fell a little flat), John and Kathryn are told that Arnie must protect them so that they and their children will fight the machines later on. Seeing as how they only met each other a few hours previous, and that Kathryn up until that morning had a fiancé you could safely call that an icebreaker. Talk about arranged marriage; this is arranged kids! With Judgment Day inevitable and looming large it was a little disappointing to find the finale a little underwhelming, perhaps too clinical and formulaic, which seems obvious given I have already pointed this out as a replica of T2.Arnold and Lady-T go roboto-a-roboto and cause millions of dollars in property damage, and all the while John Connor and Kathryn seem to stay just far enough and just close enough to danger.The lady-Terminator seemed deadly but a little dumb, many times she had a target in her vice like grip and instead of squeezing them to death, snapping their bones like crackers or just pummeling them into oblivion she repeatedly threw them away.I guess even robots should learn not to send a woman to do a man's job.I firmly believe that there is another ""Great"" Terminator film to be made – last year's effort was OK but hardly a classic. More than anything this frankly mediocre effort showed just how much the franchise relied on Arnie to flourish, when a 60 year old man playing a giant killer robot is far and away the best thing going for your film it highlights how pivotal Arnie really is, finding his effective replacement might be near impossible, but it doesn't mean they shouldn't try.Final Rating – 6 / 10. The non-Arnie scenes are a total drag, but that one mega-chase elevates this up a notch. The film might not be required viewing, but that scene sure is.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Great action, some funny parts, but not as good as first 2","Terminator 3 lives up to its predeccesors in respect to its action sequences and to some extent acting. However it's the story line which suffers, and is not developed in T3. The films fails to link the new aspects of what is going on with the other 2 films, mainly because the creator of the first two did not even envision a third. This time the plot concerns John Conner (Nick Stahl) more than it does the Terminator (Sharzenegger) and Conner with the help of the Terminator has to stay alive in order to save the human race on judgement day. Meanwhile a new terminator, Tx is after him to kill him, played by Kristanna Loken. Loken brings much sex appeal and hype to the role, but one can question how believable she actually is a dangerous terminator. Stahl does fairly well in his role, Shwarzenneger is pretty good reprising his role and is very comedic in some instances. Claire Danes probably gives the best performance of the film. The rest do not really matter to the plot except for Kristanna Loken who had little to say and was not the best actress for the role, although she definetely had screen presence. Overall some great action sequences, decent dialogues and some very comedic parts. Overall better than most action flicks released these days. 8/10",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Great Script, decent special effects, and good acting make this the best of them all","I think all these James Cameron cultists need to relax and sit and watch a movie without condeming it because it wasn't directed by him.   I saw this movie last night and I honestly think it was the best of the 3. I used to think that T-2 was amazing and that nothing could be better but then i watched it again the other night and realized that i just got caught up in the hype when i was younger and now that you see it T-2 isn't all that great. Overall T-3 has a excellent script, great acting by all involved, and the ending was excellent, it made sense, and it was like a punch in the gut.   I wasn't expecting too much from this movie and i came away with far more than i ever expected. I liked how a little more humor wasincorporated into this one seeing as how we are dealing with such a heavysubject like the end of mankind and I thought the visuals were excellent. the only negative i have is that some of the car chases were a bit excessive butother than that this is a more than fitting installment into this great science fiction series. 10/10",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

"Been there, done that.","I guess as we see Arnold's film career spiral further down, we will have to indulge him a little more. We will have to endure his publicity stunt involving him being Governor of California and we will have to see him try to go back to something that worked for him before. So, here goes Terminator 3. Sadly, the third installment is by far the weakest of the trilogy. The character and the story has been played out. Oh sure, Arnold's character is much more hero-friendly than the the first installment and even second installment. However, as I watched this standard paint by the numbers sci-fi thriller play itself out, I just felt depressed. You are seeing Arnold try to recreate a character that he was close to twenty years ago. Oh sure, it does not take great range to do so, but still. Perhaps it is naive to expect Arnold to have matured a little bit in his acting career. However, I guess we will not see that Clint Eastwood maturation.

A damn good summer movie,"I was a little reluctant to go see Terminator 3.  I figured that it has been over 10 yeaers since T2 and I didn't think that the franchise would be able to support a third movie.  I was WRONG. The movie expands on the history of the series and manages to answer that question of ""if we destroyed SkyNet, how is there a third movie?"" quite well. Arnold does another excellent job of portraying the stony and unemotional T-800, and Kristanna Loken does an amazing job as the new Evil Treminatrix.  Of course the fact that she is a beautiful blonds in a sexy outfit does not hurt the movie either. All in all, this is the first good movie of 2003.  I went in expecting a good action movie with maybe a little depth too it and T:3 delivered in Spades.

Somewhere in the middle of YES! and yeah.,"Smack dab in the middle of such lustrous movies as Pirates of the Carribbean, The Hulk, The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, The Matrix: Reloaded, and X2 comes Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines. You know, I remember when Arnold was mighty enough to warrant a Fourth of July opening for his movies, but apparently his studio is happy with the movie's being buried in a sea of zap!bam!pow! action movies.Ah, but enough carping about the timing. Let's get to the nitty gritty, shall we?People fall into three categories. First, there are the ones who have never seen a Terminator film. Those people aren't likely to watch this third installment. Then there are the ones who thought the second one was better than the first. Those people will probably think this one's not as good as the second, but about on par with the first. And then thee are those who thought the first one rocked like a mighty cradle; those people might be disappointed and will probably crow to the rest of us that sequels are always bad and that the original is always better.Here's the story, kids. The scene is a few years after Terminator 2. In that movie, John Connor was 11 years old. Now he's more like 14 or 15. He's on his own, pretty much bumming around the country, doing odd jobs, always on the run, that sort of thing. And somehow he runs into the Terminator along the way.Now, you might remember the Terminator as being Bad in the first movie and Good in the second. When John meets him, he doesn't know which attitude will be taken by the robot. So why is the T-800 (Arnold) back? Well, he said he'd be. But more importantly, he's here to protect John once again. And from whom, you might ask? From a T-X, a female Terminator, sent back in time by the machines in the future to kill John's lieutenants.See, the machines don't know where John is in this present time. They do have a fix on the whereabouts of the people who will become his top deputies when he finally leads the resistance. Their theory, then, is to kill them off, hoping to thwart the rebellion by man before it really develops.Funny thing, though. The homeless John breaks into a veterinary clinic to get some medicine, and it just so happens that working at the clinic is Kate Brewster, who is to be one of his lieutentants. The T-X arrives there to rub Kate out and stumbles upon John, and that's when Arnold shows up.The second Terminator movie had a huge budget, and the money was wisely spent on special effects, effects that were state-of-the-art in 1991. Now, CGI is all the rage, so the effects aren't so special. So to make up for a lack of innovation, the filmmakers (not James Cameron, who made the first two movies) throw in a lot of crashes, explosions and other loudnesses. In fact, there's a long, long car/truck chase scene near the very beginning that's pretty well done - but overlong. And, unfortunately, it occurs before the plot can really be set in place.The movie itself isn't very long - two hours is nothing for an action movie. A little more plot padding would have made me feel better about it.But back to the movie as a whole. Nick Stahl plays John now (it was Edward Furlong in the second, in his debut), and he does a great job. He looks a lot like Ed Furlong probably looks now. Kate Brewster is played by Claire Danes. Yes, Claire Danes! A bit of an unusual role for her, but she can do plucky and empathetic. And of course, Arnold Schwarzenegger is back as the T-800, the original Terminator. There's one cameo by a character who had a big role in the second Terminator movie, and it's a funny one, too.Will you enjoy this movie? I think you will, but it's not going to blow you away like the first or second may have. Arnold carries this movie for the most part, because he doesn't have Linda Hamilton from the other films (as John's mother, Sarah) to help him out. Hamilton was a big reason that T2 was so successful - her role made it more than a Guys Smash Stuff movie. This one doesn't quite escape that fate, however.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Definitely worth watching,"I'm a huge fan of the first two Terminator movies. The first film is one of my all-time favourites and the second was a near-perfect sequel  so I approached this film with a bit of trepidation. Yes, it's true. Terminator 3 isn't as good as either of the first two. The story has some weaknesses and some of the acting (mainly Stahl and Danes) isn't that great.

Arnold is finally back.,"Arnold defintely returns, not only to the Terminator series, but to good action movies, from a slump of a few years. When I first saw the trailers for this movie I thought it looked like it was going to bomb, and be terrible, especially without Cameron directing it, and Hamilton not returning as Sarah Connor.  Then I started hearing good things about it closer to its release, so decided to go see it on it's premiere night. I was amazed, Mostow had pulled it off, a very excellent Terminator movie the lived up to its name.  It didn't have as much as a ""dark"" feel to it as much as the first two, but it did have everything else.  The action, the explosions, and Arnie.  A couple of scenes did feel like they were remakes from T2, but other than that it was pretty original. The hand-to-hand fighting scenes between the good and bad terminators were off the hook. It was also nice to see some of the machines from the ""future wars"" to appear in modern day.  Some of them didn't look too different from some of the spy planes that the US military are using today, which was kind of creepy. The ending was defintely the icing on the cake, throwing me for a loop, I never expected it to end the way it did.  This movie is better than Matrix Reloaded, and quite possibly the best summer action movie of 2003.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Think about it,"Well, so far I haven't read too many compliments about this film. (I did like it, that's for sure). All of you people have to realize that T2 was 12 years ago - the effects were new, and we hadn't seen this many sci-fi-action movies back then. You have to keep this in mind when you watch this film. Nowadays we're kind of overwhelmed by computer-generated effects, blood, sex, car chases, etc. This can be the reason why we haven't experienced the same ""breakthrough-feeling"" after watching T3.

Rise of the dollar,"When compared to the first and second Terminator movies, T3 is probably average at best.The special effects were top notch but the movie seemed forced. Whereas the first and second at times grew deep and philosophical (or as much as this storyline would allow), T3 had none of that. It was just action scenes mixed in with ho-hum dialogue to explain what was about to happen next.Terminator 2 technically was a sequel, but it didn't *feel* like a sequel. T2 could have stood on its own.Terminator 3, on the other hand, pretty much assumes that the viewer is familiar with the storyline. Old characters (just one really) are shamelessly plugged in for quick appearances that didn't further the storyline one bit. New characters have been added and their histories faked to appear as if they've always been a part of the Terminator world. The movie watched as if it was the last season of some long running television series overdue for retirement.On the plus side, T3 has some strengths. As mentioned earlier, the special effects were excellent. Also, the writers gave the Terminator some hilarious moments.This is a short movie and the action moves briskly. Watch it if you're a fan of the series or if you're into awesome action scenes, but don't expect it to be very deep. 6 out of 10.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Dumb but lots of fun!,"When compared to Cameron's previous interpretations, this third installment appears to be a step back, but when viewed and judged as a standalone project, the film does just enough to entertain, and I was glad to see a female terminator, which Kristanna Loken does well in; man, she looked hot!Exciting chases, big action pieces, and, above all, a cohesive screenplay that doesn't detract from its main course, though this too had a negative impact on the narrative, particularly on the characterization front, as none of the characters seem to leave long-lasting impressions, despite all of the actors' best efforts and intentions.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Worthy addition to the series,"Terminator 3 continues to offer great sci-fi action in the tradition of it's predecessors. Arnold is starting to look a little old but he still fits in arguably the best role of his career. Nick Stahl as John Connor continues Eddie Furlong's tradition of being an annoying brat that you wish the Terminator would stop protecting. Claire Danes isn't given much to do, and the T-X is both beautiful and deadly. The movie delivers as far as great effects and action sequences are concerned but tends to lag when the story focuses on John.

Meanwhile, AI SKYNET has advanced to start a nuclear war to wipe out humans. Who will survive? This third Terminator movie may not always make sense but is exciting.

It was FANTASTIC and held true to the originals!,"I loved it!  I have seen T3 twice already and it hasn't even been out a week.  I thought it held true to the original movies and lacked nothing despite the change in makers.  The second time I saw it, I took my nine year old nephew.  He also loved it!It has plenty of action yet still a solid story line.  Nick Stahl and Clare Danes were spectacular.  You could really 'feel' for their characters.  I wanted to give ""John Connor"" a hug!  They both made me imagine what it must be like to go through this experience.When I see a sci-fi flick, it must be made in a way that I 'buy in' to it. Where my logic doesn't constantly take over and say 'that could never happen'.  This movie, like the previous Terminators is made so that I sit back and enjoy the movie and forget all the reality stuff.Terminator 3 also leaves plenty of room for a T4.

Nothing Like the First Two...,"I was able to see a preview of T3 and was excited for a lot of questions to get answered, but I didn't get much for all my enthusiasm. Arnold is plastic this time around and not very machine-like at all. The female terminator is a nice change of pace, but she is just that: a woman instead of a man to kill John Conner. Only Nick Stahl was any good in this movie. And he tries to create that same sense of fear and danger that was apparent in the first two terminator movies, but for all his effort it isn't there.If you are looking to watch something close to a James Cameron movie you may be very disappointed. But if you are looking for computer generated effects, not as much action as the previous two movies, and not have anything really answered from the second movie, then this may not be worth watching. Here's hoping T4 will be more coherent and have more action. ** 1/2 out of *****",5.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
The terminator is alive and healthyagain,"I really loved Terminator, but  Terminator 2 was kind of a disappointment. Moments full of action, sometimes very slow (and almost boring) and no story at all.However, for  Rise of the Machines,  Mr. Mostow, the same who was able to do something with acceptable with Jurassic Park III (another extinct franchise), came to the rescue and got something sometimes better, sometimes (particularly by the end) darker and overall funnier than both predecessors.Two Terminators come back to the past to defend/destroy the future resistance. The obsolete but still useful T-1 (Arnold better than ever) and the new model (Kristanna Loken) whose more interesting advantage is her ability to control other machines.  The future has changed, but judgment day is still unavoidable, and the importance of the players has somewhat shifted. John Connor is one of the targets, but there are others as important as him.  Also, this time the story has a couple of un-exploited but interesting twists and the darkest ending of the series.Arnold character, has a lot more development than the previous films.  He owns almost all the jokes and together with Claire Danes completely controls the screen.  Nick Stahl is sadly not on the same level. While Edward Furlong (on the same character in T-2) looked like a future leader, Nick looks like a future looser, not near the fighter he is supposed to become.The action, this time deserves special mention. The first car chase is worth the price of the ticket.  MATRIX looks pale in comparison and the special effects does not look `digital' at all. This seems to be real cars and buildings destroyed. If really it was a trick I am buying it.My only complain (aside from Stahls character) is the restrain of some scenes.  It looks that they really targeted the PG-13 (the movie is rated R), and failed, but the feeling is that they could have go further but they didn't.This is a 4.5 stars over 5; I hope they keep the same quality on Terminator 4.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"""Forget everything you thought before, your looking at a trilogy"" - Randy Meeks, Scream 3","In T3 the new rule laid out in Scream 3 was brought into play, and I couldn't have enjoyed it more. T2 has been one of if not my favourite movies since I was a little kid and I had been looking forward to T3 since then aswell.The story was well written and paced good, the dialogue is a bit on the weak side, but still pretty solid. Every performance in the film was done well enough with the only exceptions being a few of the bit characters.Visually the film is absolutly stunning, the effects all look very crisp, clean and natural which is something of a rare quality in the bullettime style of today.Mostow gave a great effort directing this, personally I feel that Cameron couldn't have come close to pulling this off as he likes to focus his directing projects moreso on the story and actor's delivery of dialogue. Mostow's previous works show that his films have the perfect action and dialogue balance with his projects.Now, into some depth with the story. My only major complaints with the story is definetly just how well the John and Kate characters' pasts connect. It just seemed too cliched, with the whole ""lovers from the past reunite"" crap from the basic chick flick formula.Sypnosis: If your looking for some deep story here, don't. T3 is just an action packed visually spectacular film to see. It takes the first 2 films in the story and continues the progression (T1 - Drama with action overtones. T2 - action with dramatic overtones. T3 - action) of the series, essentially showing what any future Arnoldless sequels will be like. I really enjoyed the film, and am again hoping for another Terminator movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Rise of the Forgotten Hero,"Where will they go next?At the time of writing, T3 has more than made up for its mammoth budget - eclipsing even the record-setting part 2, thanks largely to a reported 30M salary for its leading man - with a considerable box office. It won't be long before the vultures pull at the carcass and find enough sustenance for a part 4, 5 and beyond... But back to 3.The Austrian Oak was in dire need of a hit in the early Naughties, and for many, reviving this particular franchise - if two films constitute a franchise that is - smelled of desperation: haven't we mined this story's potential to the core already? And what of creator James Cameron's complete lack of interest? When your main champion prefers to go deep-sea diving than having anything to do with you, you must have done something wrong...Terminator 3 raised many questions, first of which was: is this even necessary? The truth is: now that it is here, imperfect beast that it is, it is essential. For one, it cleans up narrative issues raised in part two's time travel paradoxes (if you pay attention, Skynet created itself). It also asks interesting questions about choice vs fate, and ends in what is possibly the series most arresting visual moment. It also embraces its throwback nature, not just in accepting its aging star's limitations but in incorporating them to the story, but in its brutal, real action choreography, chiefly a nasty crane-equipped car chase that puts even the computer wizardry of Matrix Reloaded to shame.At the same time, T3 allows itself to partly spoof the original, a point of contention for many, but a refreshingly sober thing for a sequel to do in this day when follow-ups, for some reason, always have to aim for darker (see Matrix and Pirates of the Caribbean).Of course, not all is perfect: after Edward Furlong, Nick Stahl is a somewhat uninspiring John Connor, and Claire Danes is given surprisingly little to do. The worst let-down, though there is interesting conceptual work at play there, is the new antagonist, dubbed the Terminatrix by a mocking audience. There is no doubt that after Robert Patrick's glacial T1000, this is a disappointment, and something more chilling, such as a worrying fusing of human and machine, would been not just more interesting, but frighteningly prophetic, a key trait of the saga as a whole. But when Arnold appears on-screen again, a lot is forgotten and more is forgiven.The first two Terminator films are solid 10s, so by that measure this can't compare, and yet, after the disappointing Hulk and the over-hyped and overindulgent Matrix Reloaded, Terminator 3 may also well be the most entertaining blockbuster you see this Summer.Nowhere near as good or as clever as its predecessors, but good fun nonetheless.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
it all depends on what you were expecting,"ok, so we all love T2, and the original was ok, but I think there is something to be said for the new installment of the terminator series.I'm going to start off by saying that I Hate CG, but the makers of T3 used it very well in most scenes, some times i even wondered if i was watching something real, or a cartoon, and other times it was obvious, but that's not the point. it's still 12 times better than a certain star wars that will remain nameless.the only thing i'm wondering about is why they couldn't get Edward Furlong to play the older John Conner. Nick Stahl (who inherited the role) does a close to awful job as the main character, next to Claire Daines, who actually does pretty well with the part she's given. Arnold returns as the Title role; he's been doing the part for so long that i think he's finally got it down.like 7 out of 9 movies playing at the theatre right now, T3 is a sequel or a remake. one of the big problems with making a sequel or a remake is that the film makers feel as though they must pay homage to the orginals, with things that turn out no better that a pun. i feel that the movie was a little caught up in it's sequel-ness; with lines like ""she'll be back."" and other scenes that were remeniscent of the first 2.I give it a C- maybe a C. for an action movie, it was ok. for a sequel it was good. acting was pretty bad, but i can over look that. to come up with the final grade.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Best Film of the Summer,"This movie is by far the best film released since the ""Summer"" began. It doesn't get as heady as The Matrix Reloaded, and its action has a more purposeful feel, rather than the destruction-for-destruction's sake of The Hulk.The actors suit their roles perfectly. Arnold hasn't aged a bit since T2, and the T-X is a refreshing change from the T-1000. John Conner is well played by Nick Stahl and Claire Danes as Kate Brewster does a very decent job in her part.My only complaint in the James Cameron v. Johnathan Mostow debate being that Mostow seemed to opt for a few too many slow-mo shots for dramatic effect. Other than that minor issue, I really think Mostow did a fine job of following Cameron's T2. There is a good amount of ""tasteful"" humor, too.As for the story, the formula is much the same as T2 -- for the most part. Our Terminator is dispatched to stop the T-X who was programmed to kill John Conner and his commanders. There are enough plot twists to keep you interested without delving into melodrama. The whole plot is just believable enough (all things considered) to entertain.My main complaint is that the musical score for T3 uses nothing of Brad Fiedel's awesome score for the previous films. There is a redux of the ""Terminator"" theme nearer to the end, but I feel the lack of Fiedel's cold, mechanical themes detracted from an otherwise perfect action film. The movie has many great throwbacks and references to the prior films so the omission of such great themes was a pretty big disappointment for me. Overall a great action film, and the best yet for this Summer.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Once in a while, an Arnold movie can be good, but this movie is not a 6.8. I would not recommend anyone from renting, buying or seeing this movie unless your IQ is under 65 or you are nine years old. This was not one of Arnold's finer moments in film. The best of the Terminator series was Terminator 2 which is strange because usually the first movie in a series is the best.

This proves there is indeed no fate for the Terminator series.,"When I heard there was to be a Terminator 3, I was kind of excited. Then I heard that James Cameron was not affiliated in any way with the production, and with no Linda Hamilton to boot, and my expectations were pillaged. The trailers (at least the second one) were impressive, but the film was still destined, or had a ""fate"", if you will, for disappointment. On the contrary, the film's fate was not disappointment, but surprise. ""Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines"" is a truly worthy entry in the series. It has a great story, good new characters, and fantastic acting. Nick Stahl, though not resembling Edward Furlong from the second one (but looking a lot like Michael Biehn from T1), is fine as the new John Connor. Claire Danes is also good as a very sudden, yet very important and potent new character. And Arnold is, well, back as Arnold. But thats a good thing. Kristanna Loken is the T-X, a new breed of Terminator, who can shape shift, liquify, and sprout projectile weapons, all in the disguise of a blonde beauty. Needless to say, this element of the story is quite scary. She's actually scarier and nastier than the T-1000. Who would have thought? The movie's written by the guys who wrote David Fincher's ""The Game"" in 1997, a wonderful movie. This gave the production some hope. The film is very, very action packed. Almost relentless. And while it has its dramatic moments, it doesn't compare at all the the emotional impact of ""T2"". But that's fine, being from different people. The fact is, this is a true Terminator movie, and you can call the series a trilogy without a splinter. It binds the story and characters together again.

"""The machines will rise""","John Connor is now in his 20's, and a female terminator, called T-X or Terminatrix, is after him. Another T-101 is sent back through time to protect John once again on the verge of the rise of the machines.The first, original Terminator redefined action. The special effects were ahead of it's time, and the infamous James Cameron gave us what we wanted; something new. Everything was amazing. Then we had Terminator 2, which roundhouse kicked the original in the face. Everything was improved, from the acting to the action, and takes it's place as the best action sci-fi; ever. Then in 2003, a new director tries to revive the beautiful insanity of James Cameron. And as another review states; a good, but flawed, attempt at reviving James Cameron's masterpieces. And it could not be said better. The film starts out amazingly, I had high expectations in the first place. Then shortly after, you can tell the atmosphere has definitely changed... First off, the director tried feeding the film a slight dosage of humor. It some cases it works but others it is cringe-worthy. The action may considered over-the-top in some cases but the redeeming qualities include the infamous crane scene. Then we have the similarities to it's predecessor. Although not exactly the same thing, many things have noticeably been copied of T2. Example: Why was Arnold the protector of John Connor again? Why couldn't they have added some other mission for him; something original. Nevertheless, it still isn't a big factor to it's score. Then after reviewing it's bad qualities, the film does have it's times where you end up liking it. And then concluding this review, I have high expectations for Salvation, knowing that is has originality and following up to this fantastic trilogy. The Skynet war has just begun.

"As much fun as these movies are, whatever connection they had to the writings of Harlan Ellison (acknowledged in the credits of the original movie) are gone.","As much fun as these movies are, whatever connection they had to the writings of Harlan Ellison (acknowledged in the credits of the original movie) are gone. Unlike the two previous movies, this one spans only one day. And what a day it is. We have here a total commitment to special effects and explosions instead of any character development or plot. Arnold looks damn good nearly twenty years after the original film, to his credit, and his acting is, well, predictably Arnold. In both T2 and T3, he breaks the machine character in several scenes and uses ""human"" tones and expressions when communicating with the real humans. Claire Danes' character is never really developed beyond the confused girl and veterinary assistant about to be married to a man she is not quite sure she wants to marry, although there is one fairly comedic scene where John Connor looks at her and says ""You remind me of my mother."". Earl Boen reprising his role as Dr. Silberman is priceless, especially when he spots the Terminator. Nick Stahl as John Connor just does not pan out. Edward Furlong in the second movie figured out the true nature of the character when the Terminator explains his mother has been telling the truth. We watch a transition from angry kid to the potential leader of the resistance. Stahl remains the man in denial of his destiny right up to the end. Kristanna Loken never breaks character, she is the perfect Terminator, driven, relentless and uncaring. There are some other inconsistencies, mostly the hit list T-X is following in Los Angeles, which would seem to be unnecessary since LA will be one of the cities wiped out when Judgment Day occurs. But to the credit of the art department, the special effects alone in this film are worth a look.

Terminator 3 was just junk basically. If I could sum this movie up with one word, it'd be junk. They're so many things wrong with it, the movie itself just has mind-less action, a female villain, ridiculously unfunny scenes and humor. Really, a character and series like The Terminator, never should have humor, and mind-less action mixed together because it results in a disaster. This movie felt it had to be made, like the fans couldn't see it end at Terminator 2; but we waited too long, so much has changed; it could never live up to the standards as the first two. Terminator 3 is a major disappointment, and sort of adds embarrassment and negativity to the first two movies.

best movie of the year!,"After 12 years, i was surprised that a 3rd Terminator movie was actually being made. The Terminator is the classic among action movies. Terminator 2:Judgment Day really stood the test of time to this day, and I believe that it surpassed the original, with a more in-depth storyline and characters, as well as a great performance by Robert Patrick as the liquid metal terminator. Terminator 3:Rise of the Machines takes the series to a whole new level. it has a lot more in common with T2 than #1. in my opinion, i think it was the most enjoyable of the 3. Arnold Schwarzenegger was perfectly natural at the role of the Terminator as always. Nick Stahl did a good job as John Connor. Claire Danes did a pretty good job introducing Kate Brewster. and it was good to see Earl Boen, who is the only actor besides Arnold to be in all 3 of the films, make an appearance once again as Dr. Silberman. but the one who really left a huge impression in my mind was Kristanna Loken as the T-X. i think her performance is amazing and her character outdoes that of the one from T2 played by Robert Patrick. she should at least get an Oscar nominee for that performance. she's an excellent actress, and i hope to see more of her soon. the movie also had some great action sequences, including the unforgettable one in the cemetery. it's definitely one of the best and most unique action sequences i've ever seen, and i've watched countless action movies, from the low-budget, video-only ones to the smash hits at the box office. i bought the DVD yesterday and it was very interesting to listen to the commentary by Schwarzenegger, Kristanna Loken, and the others. Terminator 3 was definitely a lot better than any other movie i've seen this year, and better than most i've seen in the past several years. it had a good ending that left hinting at another sequel. hopefully Arnold will be back for the main role if a 4th one is ever made, it just wouldn't be the same without him. also, it would be great if they brought back Kristanna Loken to play another female Terminator-she's perfect for the role.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

This was an all around fun movie, with as much destruction and stoic one liners as can be crammed into a two hour movie. Whoever missed James Cameron in this film was also to busy reminiscing to perceive how good this movie really is.Granted, T-X was no-where near as sinister as the T-1000, but you were kept wondering up until the last 5 minutes of the movie how they were going to get rid of her. Now, the ending is exactly what I would hope for. A complete twist, slightly predictable, but exactly as I would like it to be. I will say no more for those who haven't seen it yet.

Mindless fun - but disrespects T1 & T2,"It seems that this film is the victim of trying to stuff as many 'what if this happens' into the script to the degree that it is no longer a movie, but a 'puff' piece trying get your attention in any way possible.  It's like all these reality shows trying to one-up each other (Who wants to Marry a Survivor Idol).  Many sequels have turned into disappointing rehashes. Alien 3 destroyed the feeling of having emotionally vanquished the big bad bugs by killing the girl and tossing Ripley back in the fire.  Godfather 3 should never be considered a legitimate successor to GF1 & 2.  When a sequel feels the need to outdo it's predecessor, it begins to lose credibility.  The most obvious problem is that, while the first film creates a successful 'formula', and the second film takes the formula and pushes the envelope, the third film can't do anything without feeling like a repeat.Indeed, T3 turns into a comedy, because everything it does as a different take on the formula is a joke.  This is too bad,  since you are dealing with a mass murdering cyborg, nuclear armegeddon,  and main characters fighting within inches of their lives.  One scene, the 'new' John Connor pleads for Arnie to help stop Skynet, Arnie replies with a dumb one liner that takes all the air out of what could have been a tense and gripping moment.  Same thing for any moment where we are supposed to take things seriously.  You can't,  so you don't feel the anxiety when lives are in danger.T2 had this tenseness,  you cared about their survival.  In T3, you already know the score.  When Arnie first runs into John,  he is scared and asks ""Are you going to kill me?"".  Of course not, we already know he is the good guy from T2.  And so on.  Just like Alien 3 & 4,  you feel you are in an alternative reality,  it has the same characters, same situations,  but it doesn't ring true.So we are only left with appreciating the stunts and special effects.  The action sequences are fun, thank God (shame on you, Hulk).  The pacing is very good (to the point that it deliberately leaves out some necessary mechanics of the story).  It clocks in less than 2 hours (something that other blockbuster movies should adhere to).  The third act propels the story very well, although the convenient daughter-of-a-Military-General-who-heads-a-secret-program arrangement reeks of cliche (hmmm...such as ""Hulk""?).I'll admit I had fun,  something some movies have forgotten about (Stars Wars 2).  I wish T3 could've taken itself more seriously.  But I agree with many other reviewers on this website that it has desecrated James Cameron's creation, (""No Fate But What We Make"" - guess not).  So I guess I like this film,  but it's no T2.I give it a 6 out of 10.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
I think this is the ruins of it all.,"As a big fan of the Terminator movies I was in awe of the possibility of a third installment.  Although the chance of wrecking those other two great movies was evident I was quietly hoping for another one.  As long as James Cameron, Arnold Schwarzeneger, Linda Hamilton and Edward Furlong were involved and they could explain how the machines have made a come-back decently I would be happy.  Two out of six just isn't good enough.Terminator 3: The Rise of the Machines is the biggest disappointment I think I'll ever have in my life.  Let's face it we all knew when James Cameron didn't sign up it was going in the wrong direction.  I just didn't realize HOW WRONG.  The appointment of Jonathan Mostow as director wasn't exactly showing the studio were moving hell and high water to give this movie any sort of chance.  Although I hear that the bigwigs cut Mr. Mostow's original T3 to shreds so maybe he isn't THAT bad.  Then we hear that Edward Furlong has been forgotten as John Connor because of drug problems.  Now I don't know about you but if I were in charge of a major franchise such as The Terminator, I would not change the face of the main character in the third movie.  It just cheapens the movie so much and when you go and hire Nick Stahl, a guy who looks nothing like Edward Furlong then your going the right way for a wrong Terminator sequel.  Maybe if the studio waited a few months and actually HELPED Edward out then this movie wouldn't be so fake to the real fans.  Most of you will know that Sarah Connor isn't in this movie. I don't want to spoil this big surprise that you have already worked out but I'll just say it's a storyline that I would be expecting from a Sons & Daughters TV soap episode, not a multi-million dollar budget action movie.Arnold Schwarzeneger makes his return as the terminator that we all love so dearly.  He enters in that chaotic fashion as in the first two films in the big disco-ball thingy.  Look at this scene and remember it as this is the last time you will have any sort of love for this movie.  Up comes the ""I need your clothes"" scene.  Humour they call it.  I can't describe the pain I felt while watching this bit...You'll have to experience it for yourself. Arnold isn't the same here.  In the other two movies he was believable and menacing.  His acting is truelly dire here and his character doesn't have any connections with the other's at all.  Where as in the second he was learning stuff and asking questions in this one he's just...there. Kristanna Loken.  She is a mobile phone with legs and a flamethrower compared to the T-1000 from Terminator 2.  Her part in the film makes no sense to me at all.  Skynet would not think that if the next assassin they send out had boobs it would have any sort of advantage.  No...the STUDIO thought that if they had a T-X with boobs they would pull in the male's who are guided by their ""other organ"" and maybe get a sponsorship deal with Kleenex Tissues when the DVD comes out.  The T-X isn't menacing, it isn't scary nor is it big or clever.  It's just...there.  For your viewing pleasure.  Please enjoy while I go throw up into a lucky-bag.Ah...John Connor.  Living ""off the grid"".  Now before this movie I was led to believe that he was trained ever since he was a small boy to be a huge commando leader type.  Instead we have a puny, moany, cry-baby wuss who I would be able to terminate with an elastic band and a paper-clip.  Nick Stahl isn't the same mould as Furlong.  He doesn't have that same street cred or charm.  He's just...there.  Now the storyline between him and Kate Brewster (Claire Danes) was pretty interesting but not enough to save this movie.  All Claire Danes did in this movie was scream and look horrified. It isn't asking much and well...she delivered.  Well done Claire!  You have just shown you are able to do the two most useful things a female can do in a male-dominated movie world.  Maybe you'll be in the next Scream sequel. *yawn*Now the special-effects were the main attraction of Terminator 2: Judgement Day.  I'm shure they will be passed off as the main attraction here as well. I just don't see why.  The fight scenes were just unbelievable...in a bad way, and the car chase scene although a good idea could have been filmed A LOT better.  To me it just isn't good enough.  You need a good director, good actors and a good script.  All three were atrocious here.  People who love this movie will hold the storyline and the apocalyptic ending (yeah you know how it ends) as their two shining good-points.  The storyline was pretty good but it sets itself up for a tire-some ""I seen this coming a mile away!"" ending that doesn't cut it.  People have been ending their movies on notes like this for so long I was shure it wouldn't be a surprise to anybody.  I haven't even mentioned the score being missing.  You would not believe how much this film misses it.  I was actually humming the tune to the start of the movie because it so obviously should have been there.Well to sum this movie up, I hated it with all my heart.  They ruined the first two classics and have the sheer audacity to set themselves up for a fourth.  Terminator fans will have to be given some sort of injection to let their grip be realised from the cinema-seats and the rest...well...they can just sit and enjoy their popcorn, the big explosions and the boobs like they are expected to.3/10",3.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Should have been better,"This is another of those films that promised the world, but didn't deliver. Granted, its not bad, but it should have been so much better. The story and acting are all generally fine, but what is lacking is the biting violence of the first movie, and to a lesser degree T2. By going for a 12A rating, the team behind this accepted that it would have to be very tame so little kids wouldn't be scared. That is where it goes wrong. This film should have been an 18 without question. The action scenes are quite entertaining, but they never go far enough, and there is a scandalous lack of gore for a film claiming to be from the action genre. T3 summarises what is wrong with so many of today's films, they are antiseptic, pale imitations of their 80s forebears. Had this film been made in say, 1988, I have no doubt that whilst the special effects would have been much worse, the film overall would have been vastly more action packed. Arnie is on top form as the Terminator and the support stars are all fine, but when you look back at T1 and T2 you realise that this is not in the same league. Arnie should also have been in this film more often, that he wasn't detracts from the film. A missed opportunity.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Saving face...,"Arnold Schwarzenegger returns as the T-800, this time sent back to take on a far superior model that is programmed to destroy other terminators, however also the fact remains that destroying the data and chips merely postponed judgment day and John Connor (Nick Stahl who replaces Edward Furlong) tries to follow in his mother's footsteps in preventing the war but finds his attempts are futile. Also there is Claire Danes who is also targeted with Connor for termination and who will also grow up to be his wife. Terminator 3 can be seen as somewhat of a comeback for Arnold after witnessing what could possibly be the longest slump of an actor's career. After True Lies, Arnold made what has to be some of the lamest action flicks of his career (And that isn't even counting his embarrassing ventures into comedy and the Batman franchise) Terminator 3 can be seen as a comeback as it is superior to everything he's made since Terminator 2 but generally inferior to everything before. (Let alone the first two of the series) One peak at the title and one is somewhat shocked at the negative emotions regarding this film, a glance at IMDb's forum labels this to come up every now and then as Arnold's worst flick. (Let's not even get into the fact The Terminator and Commando fall behind Eraser and End Of Days in the best category (Shudder)) but this is not the case and Terminator 3 holds up fairly well in the story department which is handled very well. The action sequences are also exciting and Arnold is in good form. The main flaw is the new villain who just isn't as imposing as Robert Patrick or Arnold Schwarzenegger from the original. The novel touch here is that the machine is a female but clearly she doesn't do anything the T-1000 didn't do and even though Loken is adequate, it becomes obvious that she couldn't really hold her own against Arnold. Also the return of Earl Boen (The holdover from the first two movies) is wasted and is basically forgotten soon. Indeed the whole movie feels rushed and seems to indicate that the pace is quick because the director is on a deadline. Indeed usually you want movies to be shortened but for once I would have liked to see it longer so I could have found out more about some key moments which aren't developed due to the main plot. In other words Cameron could make a movie compact and complex. Jonathan Mostow can only make the movie compact and although Terminator 3 is worth watching for the genre fan, it goes without saying that it doesn't hold up when compared to the first two. Which is of course a given.* *1/2 out of 4-(Pretty good)",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Doesn't terminate the first two, but still great","The third (and final???) installment in the Terminator trilogy brings events rate up to date and sees the birth of Skynet and the story of judgment day, and the efforts to prevent it.Without James Cameron the film lacks the finesse and tghtness of the first two films, it doesn't have the same feel, and it lacks Cameron's guiding hand. Luckily Big Arnie is on top form giving one of his better performances, probably his best film since True Lies, returning in same same role, albeit as a different Terminator unit from the same series model. This time the enemy is the immensely brutal and advanced T-X, played superbly by Kristianna Loken, who manages to combine sultry seductiveness with ruthless brutal killing seemingly effortlessly.Claire Danes, who does a fine job as Kate Brewster, a vetinary nurse who is unfortunately drawn into the war against the machines, and her performance is first rate.The script is nice, it has a few holes in it but mostly holds together OK, there are a few nice twists, especially the history of Arnie's Terminator, and the rise of Skynet is very nicely explained with a very good showing of 'American generals and politicians as morons' - watch it you'll like it.The let down of the film for me is Nick Stahl as John Conner, who gives an average performance and fails to bring much energy and depth to the character who had great potential and was played expertly by Edward Furlong in T2. In T3 Conner is a lost and selfish character hiding from nothing but himself, and there is no way to connect this John Conner with the young Conner in T2, or the resistance leader he was to become. Eddie's young Conner had a brash rebellious nature and you could see how Conner could become the leader of the human resistance to the machines, but Nick Stahl's portrayal just falls flat and doesn't impress. A nice cameo from the ever brilliant Earl Boen as Dr Silberman makes a nice comedy moment, and the sporadic light comic relief from Arnie makes the film more bearable. A shame that Linda Hamilton didn't wasn't in the film, though the character is included to make a good comedy and quintisentially Sarah Conner moment.Overall T3 is good, it doesn't have the same impact that the original film had, nor the dynamic fast paced story of T2. The film suffers from 'third in trilogy syndrome', where all the best ideas have been put into the first two and the third film is just trying to grind out the idea (see Aliens 3, Police Academy 3 onwards, etc) but everything is saved by Arnie's brilliant performance as the Terminator.Final statements - as a member of the Terminator series, it isn't as good as the first two. Had the first two never been made, or perhaps if this was the second film, not the third, it could have been called great. Its very good if viewed as a separate film, merely good when considered in the trilogy. Will there be a T4 when Arnie finishes his term as governor Terminator? Anything is possible, but judging from T3, somehow someway James Cameron will need to be convinced to work on the project.

Rise of the Franchise,"Back in Action Terminator 3 packs the action and kicks some ass in T3 which is NOT helmed by James Cameronit is now 2003, 6 years after Judgement Day, the day when skynet was to go active and judgement day was to occur, still fearing the worst, John Conner (Stahl) lives off the grid, on the street, working from town to town without any trace of his existence on computer or any records, it is at this point that the T-X (Loken) and THE Terminator (Arnie!) arrive thanks to Time Displacement and there off to the races with Loken outdoing Robert Patrick in terms of performance and menace, her T-X is a cold cruel assassin, securing a vehicle, a weapon, and openly taking out her targets who are NOT John Conner.meanwhile John Conner connects with one Kate Brewster (Danes) a Vet whose father, a military figure is dealing with how to fix a virus, his peers suggest the use of there software Skynet setting up the notion of Judgement Day which has only been postponed, as we learn from the Terminator, Judgement Day is inevitable.The principle actors are all game for this new installment which is a retread of T2 only with new and returning plot devices, the T-X is a mixture of Arnies endoskeletal Terminator with the T-1000's liquid metal acting as a shell for it. Johnathon Mostow (U-571) takes over James Camerons goliath franchise bringing freshness to the table, and as James is missed, Mostow does a stand up job of continuing the ongoing saga of John Conner and his acceptence of fate.Marco Beltrami takes over Brad Fiedel and although he does a good job, duplicating the creepy music of the T-1000 for the T-X with some added flair, Fiedels theme is tossed aside until the end credits which is a shame.over a solid film that will be sure to surprise the naysayers as this Terminator, a shorter, leaner terminator than T2, is an amazing tale.9/10",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Sci-Fi Must See Movie,"""What ever you want to see honey,"" is what I told my husband.  I had no clue that Cameron was not majorly involved in this movie.  I knew that Furlong was not going to be on the screen and hated that.  I whispered to hubby before the movie, you know if they do a T4, I don't care of Arnold is in next one.  That is how low my expectations were for this film.I left the movie going WOW!!!  I loved the action.  Some action came so fast and so furious that this non computerized brain could not process what it had just seen.  Alot of action was hard hitting.One reviewer stated Dane's character was not very credable especially when she locked up John Conner and did not go running for help.   I would like to think that this character had some backbone and was a strong person, knowing that she knew him, felt that there was no need to panic, yet.  And in the long run that is who she needed to be.Other reviews I have read say there is no story line.  I saw that TX (the latest model of terminator) was intent on its mission  (ITS - non gender its not human)  Like a machine with specific tasks TX took the straightest possible route from point A and point B.One person commented on how they did not like that TX said ""I like your gun"" while other Terminator models made same comments on objects they were about to take.  I assumed that this was the film makers way of telling us how the TX was going remove the cop from its path.As for Furlong not being in the movie, by the end of the movie I felt that the new actor represented John Conner the adult, the scared face warrior of the future.I loved seeing the Dr from T2.  I thought it was a nice sentimental touch. (Maybe Cameron-esque)Lastly,  The T100 unit (Arnold) was not portrayed as compassionate (for those who have not seen T2 on DVD - there is footage that shows changes made to the terminator allowing him to learn gain a bit of humanity)  This was not the same machine from the previous movies and I liked the reinforcement of that fact.While this movie may have disappointed some, I found it completed a circle between the three films and if this is the last of the Terminator movies I think it was well done.And as Dennis Miller use to say... Thats my opinion.. I could be wrong.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
They spent over $170 million on this?,"I went into this movie not expecting much, afterall it lacked Linda Hamilton, James Cameron, even the man that did the musical score. Arnold was there but, hey, you've seen the type of movies he has been in lately. Lets just say you can tell this wasn't written by Cameron. Its doesn't even seem to be written to any coherent line of reason. Why would the Terminatrix go after John's lieutenants if the other two could care less in the past? Why did her hand magically fix itself when her programming told her it was broken? Why would Sarah Connor fill her coffin with weapons? How does a machine remote control cars when no such computer exists in said cars? How the hell did the Terminatrix even find and then outrun John's truck with that huge semi truck (They can't move THAT fast!) Where did the computer virus come from? How is Skynet still Skynet since it was originally a mainframe but now a software program? The original films say Skynet killed virtually everyone when they tried to pull the plug when humanity feared Skynet's sentience yet here they supposedly can't since its ""software"" and not ""hardware"". So the memory of the Terminator from T2 was false since that data came from Skynet? Why didn't this Terminator kill humans since he didn't swear to John like T2 and especially since he could only take orders from Claire Danes? What was up with the one liners by Arnold? How was this Terminator's power source different from the two prior movies? In Terminator and T2 you see the main power source is in the abdominal area with a back up. Here he has some stupid slot where he can crack it open and turn it into a mini nuclear bomb. Why did the military have multiple prototypes? Last time I checked a prototype of anything was simply that one piece to be tested and then built in mass if it worked. Why the hell did the place even have a particle accelerator when their work in the lab had nothing to do with atomics?!?!? How did the Terminatrix even pull herself off the magnet when it was never turned off? Why did John continue to hang around the L.A. area if he didn't want to be found? And this is only a few of my problems with the flick. The acting wasn't that good (John is definately not an inspiring leader), the plotting was slow, and they attempted too much humor (the growing breasts was useless and sophmoric). James should have gone with the original T2 ending of John Connor playing in the future with his daughter as Sarah watched talking of how they averted Judgement Day. This trash was far from worthy of the Terminator name and, funniest of all, I saw this movie the day after the premier and the theater was virtually empty. Is that a good sign?",1.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
great movie with thoughtful action,"I loved this movie. Yes James Cameron is a much, much better director but, the script was really good. It's sad that James didn't direct it because it was worthy of his attention. This movie has action, laughs, surprise twists and great acting! Arnold has gone the extra yard for a touchdown. Christana Loken was fantastic and a much better terminator than the villain-terminator in T2. Claire Danes gave a wonderful performance and the guy who played the John Conner character left us feeling just the way we should about John Conner. The F/X were really good and there were creative twists. But forget the 'splosions and think about what's being said. These movies are warning about technology out of control.

Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines (2003) ***,"John Connor (Nick Stahl), now in his 20s, is still targeted for termination. This time his would-be assassin is a gorgeous though deadly ""Terminatrix"" (Kristanna Loken) sent back to try and accomplish what the last two males could not succeed at doing. The eager Arnold Schwarzenegger makes his third appearance, as yet another friendly cyborg who's hot on T-X's high heels to protect young Connor.After the mind-blowing spectacle that was TERMINATOR 2: JUDGMENT DAY there was just no way this third film could compete. It also feels very much like a rehash of what we've already seen twice before. But yet it remains enjoyable enough due to Arnold, and even more so thanks to Ms. Loken's sexy yet locked-in version of the ominous female killing machine. I have a real problem with Nick Stahl in this movie, as he looks nothing like Edward Furlong (the kid from T2) and his rather delinquent character as written doesn't seem up to the task that's expected of him in the quickly brewing Rise of the Machines. *** out of ****",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Pretty good action movie but mediocre Terminator film,While T3 does have some good ideas on the Terminator storyline it falls way short of the greatness of the first two.  Instead of introducing exciting original action sequences we get thinly disguised remakes of chases and scenes from mostly T2.  Instead of an original villain we get the female version of Robert Patrick's T-1000.  Instead of a strong complex female lead we have a frightened Clara Danes.  It's not all disappointing though.

"Better action than Matrix, but loss of T story...","A few have already said this, but I'll say it again anyway... It would have been  better with James Cameron.  The acting was not up to par, and the overall aura  of the film lacked from the feel of T1 & T2. I'll say now that I did like it very much, but not nearly as much as the first two.There are some things that just don't make sense, but there were those in the  first 2 as well.  Whenever you deal with time travel you are going to have some  holes in the plot.  I wasn't bothered by ""when or why"" the Terminators were sent  back.  I was bothered, however, by John Conner talking to Arnold and  seemingly unaware that it was not the same Arnold from T2.  I mean, doesn't he  remember the Arnold from T2 was destroyed? Conner was there and saw him die, I would have thought it'd make an impact. The new Conner just seems dumb.  This brings me to say that Stahl is no Furlong--maybe for the better in  real life, but not in the movie.The action scenes were indeed amazing.  I saw Matrix 2 last week, and unfortunately had to sit through near 20 minutes of men jumping all over cars  and trucks on the freeway.  The chase scene in T3 is short and sweet and originally well done. There is some humor in the film, which is nice. The acting, as I said earlier,  could have been better--especially when compared to the first two with Linda Hamilton.  It was a shame she wasn't in this one.  I assume they just couldn't get  her to do it.The female terminator was okay.  And I have no problem with Claire Danes, aside from the fact that the more new people in the film, the less like ""Terminator"" it feels.I won't spoil anything here, but if you've seen the movie you'll know what I mean:   There is certainly space for a T4, and it certainly could be great--but only if  Cameron have more say in this film.  Otherwise, it should be under a different  name.I'll sum it up by saying that T3 is a great action flick, but it lacks the sci-fi feel of  like the other 2 (especially the first, did).  However, it would have been nice to  end the series at T2, or get Cameron and the original cast to make a movie more similar to the first two.  It's turning more into a ridiculous action film--don't  get me wrong, good action--but lacking story...",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
This is like a bad dream...,"How could they do this? How could James Cameron let them? T2 was and is the only reason I ever give action movies a chance. Its heart and simple but powerful theme has haunted me ever since I was a child, when I would stay up all night and watch it while everyone was asleep, so not a single sound would distract me. It to me is so much more than great special effects that were astounding for their time, more than a huge action blockbuster. It was and is a portrait of humanity's struggle against the horrors we create for ourselves, of the cruelty of fate, of the power of family. It is an example of all the right elements coming together at the right time to create something so powerful and moving that it has inspired a force of loal fans who seem to feel the same outrage I do about T3.T2 ended with a sense of hope for the future, leaving us all the gift of being able to imagine ourselves the fate of the world. No one could've devised a better ending to the story. T3 (and now T4, I hear) are lame excuses to use a popular name and popular characters to continue a story in a way that sends it spiraling down from the intelligence and power it had in T2. It infuriates me that anyone would cheapen an excellent movie with unnecessary and inferior sequels. Does anyone in Hollywood bother to think up *original* ideas anymore? Maybe I should stop coming up with my own ideas for screenplays and novels and, I don't know, pen a crappy sequel to E.T. ::sigh:: The casting probably bothers me more than anything else, oddly enough, though I would have protested any superfluous sequel no matter who it starred. Frankly, Claire Danes should not be on camera. EVER. Anyone who made the mistake of seeing the trashy remake of Romeo and Juliet, made for those who can't bear the pain of cracking a book, will get what I'm saying. She acts like she's reading off a cue card, and that really only works for Arnold, who will never get my vote for betraying the Terminator story. Linda Hamilton, who gave a stunning performance in T2, was smart enough to stay away, and I hope Eddie Furlong, who did a remarkable job in T2, especially considering he'd never acted before, never sees the imbecile they replaced him with.I guess the people behind T3 thought they were terribly clever using a female villain, the reasoning being, I suppose, ""Hey, she has boobs! That will make up for our utter lack of plot!"" I shudder to think what T4 will be throwing at us. Maybe John Connor's future children will fight the machines a la Spy Kids, and Hilary Duff can provide the soundtrack. Sadly enough, if T3 was possible, anything is.The nightmare continues. Since sequels are proving how undefeatable those machines are, maybe they can transport me back to 1992, so I can prevent this from happening.",1.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Arnold Delivers!,"Wow, just got back from Arnold's new flick, or perhaps it's not only Arnold's: wonderful to see him finally again sharing the screen with other actors. The film truly delivered, it was action packed, yet, unlike the matrix, the action was remarkably realistic (as realistic as you can go with robots from the future). Arnie was in his old form: fewer lines, more punching, and yes he was funny... Almost all of his one-liners worked with the crowed, and yap, a number of times the theater burst out laughing. The plot was strong, and while it wasn't adventurous by having too many side plots, it delivered, and stayed strong through out the movie.Performances were excellent: John Connor (Nick Stahl) was strong and convincing, Arnie was Arnie , and TX (Kristanna Loken) was hot yet managed to stay scary... The only major actor who I was not really positive about was Kate Brewster (Claire Danes) they tried to replace John's mom with a new face, but I think they should have dropped that personality from the story...Special FX were well done, but not over done... They left off from the old T2, and managed to have the same combination of CGI effects and real effect (i.e. explosions) in a very convincing fashion, quiet amazing... However, while T2's effects were groundbreaking, T3's were just plain excellent...Finally the ending sequence and the twist, were unexpected and positive, and in my honest opinion left the crowed very happy.The movie wasn't as smooth as T2, and probably could best be compared to ease of transition to The Transporter and Bourn Identity, the best recent action films I could think of.Overall the film was a surprise, I expected eye candy, and I certainly got it, but the strong preferences and compelling plot elevated it to the top action film in recent memory. So anyone who can enjoy an action film should see this one!8.5/10",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

"Great action, quickly forgotten","This somewhat unnecessary sequel is nevertheless enjoyable.  You can unplug from reality and ride the rollercoaster of thrills that this film provides. Then you can quickly forget it and go about your business.The story nicely explains away why everything isn't honkey-dorey after John and his mom averted Judgement Day.  I still wonder why John Connor of the future can't send a newer model to save his younger self, but... the film is popcorn for the mind and candy for the eyes.  Enjoy!",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Chases and Twists,"Wonderful fight scenes - after watching The Matrix and its clones, the ""retro"" down and dirty fight style between the two cyborgs are almost refreshing. No Wired-Foo!!!Wonderful chase sequences - the huge trucks and several blocks of condemned buildings being crushed look much less choreographed than the dozens of sports carts used in 007 and the recent Bond clones.Good story and screenplay - even though most of the film is devoted to pure action, the actors are given enough screen time to let their characters shine through, especially Claire Danes, who did a wonderful job playing both Sarah Connors of the first two movies of the series (you will know what I mean when you see the film).This is definitely not as great as the first two Terminator movies. Most actions in the first two take places during the night, and the darkness adds a much more hair-raising air. Instead, almost the entire T3 takes place during the day, and it's just not as scary, plain and simple.Also, director Jonathan Mostow showcases his skill on action, but he clearly lacks the personal touch of James Cameron. Even though the T-X is more powerful than anything we've seen in most Si-Fi movies, she's just not as cold and scary as the first two assassins played by Arnold and Robert Patrick. The eyes of the first two cyborgs in T1 and T2 send chills down my spine; Christana Loken just doesn't have the feeling of a sharpened blade like her male counterparts.But still it is a good movie, especially the twist at the end of the film that will force you to reflect on the world and your own life. And I must comment on the makeup artists, who has done a wonderful job make Arnold actually look much the same as in T2, more than a decade ago.However, the movie left me with a bitter taste in my mouth as I leave the theatre.--- S P O I L E R ---The first two movies emphasizes on a single line - ""No fate but what we make"", the twist at the end, even though good for storytelling, totally negates that simple ideal. It wipes the efforts in the first two films clean and basically says that you cannot go against fate.Not surprising though, as the first two films reflect on the 80's - ""you make you own fate""; whereas T3 reflects on a much more spiritual 90's - ""you cannot avoid your fate"".No wonder James Cameron doesn't want to be involved with this one.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Graded with excellence,"The main problem I had with Terminator 3: Rise of The Machines is that it's a film that feels a bit too familiar. While I would say that T3 does have many action sequences, that in itself is the problem. T3 feels like one long chase scene, but offers no real reward at the end.  Character development seems to be drowned in the relentless action, and the film suffers from it as a result. Also the plot line seems to be borrowed from its predecessor T2, making it very predictable, and somewhat outdated; especially when swartzenegger spills his famous line ""I'll be back,"" that was popular over a decade ago. There is a fine light in the film, and that light comes in the form of Claire Danes, who plays an everywoman veterinarian. Danes adds a bright spot with her fine acting skills, but she seems as though she could have contributed more to the film, had the film actually focused on characters, rather than being forced to giveway to exploding cars, and other mindless action that would make a demolition derby seem sophisticated.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
T2 remains the best movie...,"T3 is still a great movie, and there is a lot to like about it, and I still really enjoyed watching it, however there are some problems with it that make it disappointing for me. Reading some other reviews from people, I can see I am not the only one who had problems with it, and perhaps if James Cameron was on board with this film, it would have been much better.First, Edward Furlong should have been back for John Connor. I'm not trying to take away anything from Nick Stahl, because he did a great job. In fact, he looked somewhat like a younger Kyle Reese, and at times, even looked like Furlong himself, but why didn't they just get Ed back for the 3rd - it would have been that much better if they had.Next, was the fact that the T-101 was still trying to be like the T-101 from the second film, despite the fact that it was a different cyborg. Why was it still copying the behaviour that it's predecessor had been taught then, such as not killing humans and looking for the keys under the sun visor?Finally, the movie didn't seem to go for long enough, and the story was quite shallow. Elements of a fantastic story were there, but were only brushed over. The whole thing seemed very rushed and actually I was disappointed when the credits began to roll because I thought there needed to be more to the story.Having said that, T3 is still a good movie, by all means, I would recommend you see it, especially if you are a fan of the previous 2 films, or love Arnie. However T2 still remains the best film.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
What the hell was that?,"After seeing T2 on video, complete with directors cuts, I though T2 was the best movie I'd ever seen in my life. Emotion mixed with action, complete with plot and believeable characters. Great! So I was all hyped up when T3 came out, and went to see it at the first showing in my cinema... I came out thinking why was that so good? Where did the $185m budget all go? It was all just blowing stuff up. Even the T-x was a disappointment- she just didn't seem that much more advanced (compared to the T-1000). And John... the way he acted just didn't seem like John! He wasn't the way I thought he'd be... Basically, I thought T3 was pretty rubbish, and to me it was a big disappointment. The storyline was... well, nonexistant, the dialogue (especially from the T-800) sounded forced and like they were just going for the jokes. Terminator is not a comedy, so don't try and make it one! Any humour that should be in it comes naturally. And that's about all I have to say...",1.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

The film is unbearably boring and inevitably dull. There are two wooden facial expressions on Arnie and they are so predictable, that you can play the whole role instead of him. Kristanna Lokkn is a bad actress indeed. She doesn't even pretend to play, she just runs well, falls down well, looks in a blank stare well and then kills fast. See, anyone else can play this all. You didn't need to pay Arnie so much bucks for this trash! The very scene of the cars' chase is also very predictable and it is not even funny. The biggest problem of this sequel is a sheer absence of any humor and then totally bad play of those young actors who are John Connor and his future wife.

"Definitely inferior, but it's not THAT bad","So yesterday I watched Under Siege 2 and today I watched Terminator 3 for the first time since I saw it in theaters when it was first released. I remember being hugely disappointed when I first saw it, but I noticed that I enjoyed it much more the second time around. It's better than I thought the first time I saw it, but it should be noted that there is no arguing with the fact that, even though it does a good job of furthering the Terminator story, director Jonathan Mostow is just not taking it very seriously.That becomes clear almost immediately, as the Terminator walks into a bar during ladies night and has a run-in with a gay dancer, ultimately walking out of the bar clad in leather and putting on a purple pair of glittery star-shaped sunglasses. The entire movie became one of those rare theater experiences where everyone is laughing out loud and making jokes about the movie but nonetheless enjoying it, and no one seems to mind all the talking and giggling.It's immediately clear that Arnold is just not the same guy he was only ten years earlier. For some reason, he seems a lot more than ten years older here than he was in Judgement Day, and to make matters worse, his English seems to have slipped. His accent is much stronger now than it was before and it affects his performance. It's hard not to laugh out loud when he approaches Claire Dames and says, ""Catherine Broo-stuh?""In the movie's defense, I loved the addition that it made to the Terminator story. We are given believable reasons for why there are still terminators even after the only chips were destroyed at the end of T2, and the ""rise of the machines"" is also well presented.The biggest problem with the movie is the casting. Claire Dames is good in her role of Catherine Brewster, a key element of the humans resistance against the machines, although she is just a little too recognizable. But Nick Stahl? Are you serious? From the very beginning of the movie, where he is shown as an older man in the future, Stahl is wildly miscast as John Connor.Why didn't they just cast Eddie Furlong again? He's not the same guy he was back in 1992, but I can't imagine anyone else fitting the character as well. And surely he wasn't too busy, unless he was more interested in acting in the disappointing and instantly forgettable crime thriller ""3 Blind Mice"" than making another Terminator film. Such a thing hardly seems possible.The other problem is that Kristannak Loken, who is undeniably beautiful, just doesn't understand the nature of her character, nor does director Jonathan Mostow. In the original film, Reese explained to Sarah Connor that the first Terminators had latex skin and were easy to spot, but the new ones had real organic tissue and looked exactly like normal humans.Nevertheless, every time the Terminatrix is on screen, it's hard not to picture Mostow just off-camera saying, ""Do it again, and this time, try to act more like a machine!""Wasn't the whole point of the newer and better Terminators to look and act more like humans and not like machines? At any rate, it just comes off as over-acting here.But still, like the new Indiana Jones movie, the entertainment level is high, and there are certainly some good moments, like the Terminator telling John, ""Desire is irrelevant. I am a machine!""I have a feeling that part 3 is going to be a low point in the series, which I'm not sure when it will end. I am thrilled to know that Christian Bale will take on the role of John Connor in Terminator: Salvation. It looks like the series is heading in exciting new directions",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Better than The Terminator,"On the verge of Judgement Day, the most advanced Terminator unit ever, the T-X, arrives from the future to ensure the rise of the machines. The only hope against it is a new upgraded T-800 unit, the T-850, that is sent back by the human resistance. Together with John Connor, it must stop the rise of the machines or all humanity will fall.Like i've said in my past reviews, I never appreciated the concept of people going back in time to do all these things so this will happen in the future as much as other people did. However, the second movie decided to top it off. Nw the reason to watch this movie is to find out why is there still a Judgement Day and what happened to John Connor's mother.Well, they decided to take the easy and risk-free way out of it, turning this into a big, fun, and loud action film. Well, it's worth it. Although it doesn't put the mind into the plot, it certainly is (ironically) a better movie than the first.Now you guys might go crazy because I said this. I just like it a lot more than the first film, although not as good as the second. The action scenes are tons better than the first two films and the CGI really done well. The plot is still the same as ever and the dialog is campy and fun.So the general word in this film is ""fun"". Don't take it too seriously. It has a lot of humor and equal drama. The action sequences are fantastic and has one of the best car chase sequences I've ever seen. Arnold Schwarzenegger has a bigger and better role in here and Kristanna Loken, playing the new Terminatrix, has a perfect performance. Her role on the Terminator is great! It's just that good! The other two (Nick Stahl and Claire Danes) were also good.The score, although not the same as the first two, is good. The direction by Jonathan Mostow is good, although this sequel is unnecessary.If you would just like to have a good fun time on a popcorn movie, this is the film for you.

That's all i'm sayin'.  See if you like Arnold Schwarzenagger as the Terminator alone; if you will.BUT see it for the hot new terminator, as well.  She did very well.  Some say her performance was too mechanical.  Um... hello???  'Nuff said there, i think.  She's very beautiful and cold looking at the same time.  Though she's a lot smaller than Arnold; she appears as a formidable foe to the ""obsolete"" T101 model.  Let's just say The Terminator had his hands full with this pint-sized beauty AND beast - The TX (Terminatrix).The actor playing John Connor delivered a very believable performance and didn't seem nervous next to the great Arnold; and yet he wasn't trying to over-act to compensate, either.  The two worked well together if maybe slightly less a father-and-son combo as the John Connor in T2.  Still, very well done!The 'other' girl in the flick was good, too.  I know i know her from somewhere, but she did just fine for the character she was and again didn't try to over-do it, at all.  You do feel sympathy for her and times and yet see why she becomes what she becomes in a post-judgment day world.All in all, i gave it 8 out of 10.  For such a long wait; maybe i wanted too much.

"oh, the good old days","Kristanna Loken and Claire Danes are absolutely beautiful. Great to look at. The movie has our old friend arnold in his best role. The casket of guns and a few other comedic points are good for some laughs. But what this movie suffers from is what makes it invisible and boring compared to the first terminator movies. James Cameron not directing the characters he invented hurts. The presence of Sara Connor is sorely missed. And maybe it because I'm older and harder to please than when Terminator 2 came out (i was like 12 or 13) , or it could be that when it came out CGI special effects were very new and very impressive, now with 12 years, a couple of Jurassic Park movies, Matrix movies, and several hundred lesser movies featuring CGI, the effect no longer seems special and can even seem cumbersome and even downright distracting. All that said T3 will be somewhat enjoyable film though Loken's villain lacks Robert Patrick's utter child-molester creepiness from part 2. But it didn't leave me floored like part 2 did.

A new terminator, the TX has been sent back to destroy all those who were commanding officers under John Connor, but John, along with the help of an allied terminator go on a rescue to save his future wife from being killed by the new improved terminator TX and to stopping judgement day.The ending is not what you would expect, the new TX was very cool although she had 2 lines in the whole movie and as for the rest of the cast, Arnie is back butt naked again as the allied terminator, but apparently isn't the same one that died before... he's a new one and he only takes commands from Kate Brewster... John Connor's future bride, but the kids here have some history, which Kate keeps bringing up at odd times.

"An Unrefined, Unimpressive & Unnecessary Addition To The Terminator Saga.","An unrefined, unimpressive & unnecessary addition to the saga that was fully told by James Cameron in the first two films, Terminator 3: Rise of Machines arrives as the second sequel to an already finished series that tries to kill the validity of a highly influential franchise & succeeds to a certain extent, and remains one of the most disappointing sequels in cinema history.Following the events of Terminator 2: Judgment Day, the story of Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines is set in the year 2004 in which Skynet once again sends another Terminator back in time to kill the future high-ranking members of human resistance after it is unable to locate the position of John Connor while a reprogrammed T-850 model arrives from the future as a protector of John & his future wife, Kate.Directed by Jonathan Mostow, Terminator 3 is an insipid, stupid & inferior sequel that lacks everything which made its predecessors two of the most groundbreaking films in the genre of action & sci-fi. The screenplay is marred by its poor storytelling, dull dialogues, complete lack of depth, terrible characterisation, forgettable villain & soulless action, which gets even worse with the lifeless performance its cast puts up.Despite the advancement in filmmaking technology over the years, its technical aspects are no match to the first two chapters of the franchise. Camera-work is all over the place, for it is impressive in a few sequences & absolutely dodgy at other moments. Editing makes the film a tedious affair to sit through, visual effects is highly inferior in comparison & the score by Marco Beltrami isn't that captivating either.Coming to the performances, the cast comprises of Arnold Schwarzenegger, Nick Stahl, Kristanna Loken & Claire Danes and not one of them manage to leave a lasting impression. Schwarzenegger's character is ineffectively handled, Loken's T-X is a major step back after the indestructible T-800 of the first film & the invincible T-1000 of the second while Stahl & Danes are very mediocre in the roles of John Connor & his future wife Kate, respectively.On an overall scale, Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines is one sequel that had no reason to exist other than to dent the legacy of the remarkable universe its first two films created. It only goes on to show just how vital James Cameron's input was to this series & without his vision, it's just another cashgrab sequel trying to milk out the franchise for all its worth. The film sure has a couple of stunning moments but for the most part, the process of sitting through Rise of the Machines feels wholly redundant. Worth skipping.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

What a Turkey! Brings the Terminator series and IMDB to shame..,"Me, my girlfriend and two others were on a week holiday to Amstedam when we decided to check out Terminator 3, which I had been looking forward to for a long time; I like (futuristic) action movies, I liked the other Terminator-movies, and this movie had gotten a pretty decent IMDB rating.We stepped into the cinema, and.. what followed was a chain of disappointments and to be blunt - extreme annoyances.Here are some of the ""goodies"" what you can expect when you go to see T3:1. jokes and humour with references to previous films - which very quickly grow very, very old (""she'll be back""). 2. far too long and tedious action scenes (and I love the Matrix, T1, T2, etc and action in general). 3. plot holes with a B-movie, low-budget quality to them. MANY of these.This is the one film where I cannot get myself to agree with or understand the IMDB rating it has gotten. One of the worst, dullest films I've ever seen, has at this moment a 7.1 IMDB rating. IMO it deserves something around the 3.0-5.0 mark.

Jonathan Mostow has to be applauded for bringing this talented young actor into such a big movie for all us young ladies to dribble over.Kristanna Loken, who is a little scary I must admit, is amazing at playing a new, more advanced, terminator model, named TX, who is trying to kill John Connor.  She only has a few lines in the film (like six), but I feel that this scares the audience even more as she has to act simply through her facial expressions.  Again, Jonathan Mostow has done a great job in casting when he introduced us to this former model.All I have left to say is that the special effects in T3 are the way that special effects should be, they are not fake like in The Lord Of The Rings or Harry Potter.

HUGE LETDOWN,"I need to be very careful not to give away anything, but I will state what I feel the major failings are:1) From Edge of Realism to Comic Book. The thing I loved about the first 2 movies was even though much of it was unbelievable, there was quite a bit of tension and realism to the characters and chases. The problem was that T2 pushed the limits. They decided to go farther, and it just became rediculous. Most of the chases I found myself laughable they were so silly.2) Too Many rules changed. If you watch T1 and T2 before T3, you will see exactly what I mean by the way the T-101 acted, especially, since it's not supposed to be the same as from the prior movie(s).3) The theme changed. I feel like the story was going one way in the first 2 movies, and they completely changed their minds as to what to do.Now, I don't want to say the story was without merit and the ending wasn't good, but it was executed and designed POORLY. It feels more like ""let's revive the Terminator movie just to make it"" rather than ""now, how do we pull it all together?"".I think perhaps another 6 months to 1 year to work on the storyboarding and scripting was needed to make this a really good movie, because if this was the first movie, there would NEVER EVER EVER been even a snowflake's chance in hell on the hottest day of the year while sitting in an over set to 5,000,000 F all day for a sequel, let alone anyone caring about it.James Cameron, WHY DID YOU LET THEM DO THIS TO YOUR MOVIE???!!!!!

Dense and Denser,"The 'Terminator' series has always had its plot going against it.  Time travel is finicky business and, unfortunately, 'Terminator 3' takes an already convoluted and mixed-up time plot and changes it around.Instead of a fairly well planned plot, we get a mixture of ""Terminator 2"" with ""The Fast and the Furious"".  There really isn't anyway they can top the previous movies without going overboard in one department and lagging in more critical ones.  T2 proved that.  How many different ways can they make the same car chase?Jonathan Mostow is competent as a director, but he lacks James Cameron's legendary touch.  ""B-o-o-h-o-o.""

Missing though, was the vision of former Terminator director James Cameron's view on the subject, although this one has enough action going for it that no doubt, Jonathan Mostow will be back, perhaps on a movie of his own, so there will be no obvious comparisons with anyone.If by the end of the film, the viewer is not worn out by this action packed flick, I don't know where was he. Arnold will be Arnold, no matter where he appears. He is his own worst cliche. There are very funny touches in this version, especially when Arnold arrives at the beginning of the film and walks into the strippers joint. It was hilarious.The only thing now is we must wait a few more years for the next T4 film. What will happen if Arnold Schwarzenegger gets the nomination and is elected as governor of California? Will he go back to do another sequel? Let's hope there are enough millions on the table to convince Arnie to accept the challenge. After all, what would be the point of another Terminator without him.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Still scratching my head at all the hate for this movie,"Just watched it again the other night and I still am having a hard time trying to figure out what it was about this movie that the so-called critics, let along the goofballs on this website, didn't like.The special effects are fantastic. The story is good. The acting is just fine. Loken does great as the TX and the Crane car-chase scene was nothing short of awesome.I have seen Dark Fate and even though it's a great movie in it's own right, I really felt there was no need for it, as this movie carried on the saga just fine.Anyway, ignore all the hate on this website and enjoy the show.

"Interesting, but not as good as Terminator 2","While this film was interesting, and imaginative with the large crane in the chase scene, I felt that it went a little over the top a few times and was not as engaging or spellbinding as Terminator 2.Hopefully this will be the last of this series, since it is unlikely that any improvement will occur in any future sequels.  I think the story line has reached its conclusion unlike the James Bond series which seems to keep on rolling along.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
why did James Cameron not save this almost-perfect trilogy?,The director of this film killed terminator 3. He couldn't even get the old music theme.

Action packed! But it lacked the Worldly omnipresent feeling......,YES Arnold is still imposing at 55! Kristanna Loken is gorgeous! decent performances by the cast all around.. the movie lacked a scene which involved thousands of people dying fleeing etc. at least thats what i expected..... the bathroom fight scene was one of the best ever!

Disappointing; Shocking Lack of Originality,"If you want to see T3, just watch T2 again and then add on five minutes worth of plot mythology development. Basically, T3 seems to exist to make money, instead of make money and take us meaningfully forward in the Terminator franchise.Let's see ... Terminator sent back in time to kill John Connor (and a few others, given lip service but no meaning)? Check. Other Terminator (older model) sent back to protect Connor? Check. War between humans and self-aware machines coming? Check. Car chases involving big, destructive trucks? Check. Bar scene where naked Terminator gets clothes? Check. Organization that will unwittingly allow self-aware machines to control nuclear weapons? Check.I mean, what was new? Very little. A minor philosophy change involving fate (Sarah Connor turns out to be wrong after all). A very brief bit of reprogramming that causes a good guy to be a bad guy for a few minutes. Even the fancy new Terminator is very similar to the new one in T2. It has an additional weapons ability and one minor wrinkle where it can control machines, but really, who ever thought a Terminator couldn't do that?That's just the beginning. This movie raises many questions about its own story. For instance, if it is so easy for the machines and humans to send machines back in time, how can this ever end? Why not send a Terminator back to 1961 and kill Sarah Connor as a child? Or kill her parents back in 1930? The franchise really needs to point out that this process is terribly difficult and limited.Also, John Connor knows how he will die. So now that he knows, why can't he prevent it? It's not like it is a random bomb. There is a very specific set of actions that must occur for Connor to die, and Connor himself must OK one of them. So why would he ever do it?T3 is very disappointing, and one of the most crass cash grabs I have ever seen from Hollywood.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"a pretty good movie, but would have been better with James Cameron","First of all, I would like to say that I enjoyed the movie...Arnold came back for the 3rd time and did an excellent job as the terminator yet again.However, there are a few things that I didn't understand. 1.If the terminator was a different machine in this movie and didn't remember anything about when he was with young john, then how did he know to find the car keys in the visor(young john taught him this)???? 2.Why do they keep on sending back terminators to protect him from the evil ones???Why couldn't they just send a terminator to destroy skynet and be done with it. 3.If they destroyed the skynet lab in T2, how did skynet magically reappear for the 3rd movie to destroy the world????Besides the fact that most of the movie was confusing, I still enjoyed it but would prefer the wonderful direction of James Cameron over Jonathan Mostow any day!!!!",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Better than I expected!,"I like action movies.  Not the imitation skinflick, straight to the video store, foreign crap we often get.

Well.And, unlike so many other of his so-called ""peers"", he's not afraid to get his character's face messed up.  He is good and he knows it.Now the movie is really a comic book story, a better than anime drama about humans struggling against machines (both corporate and steel), a regular pile of doggy doo--except that these actors and actresses pull it out of the toilet, polish it up and make it the movie of the summer that you'll NEED to see again.And, at just under 2 hours, you and your friends/family won't mind seeing it more than once.Do it.

"If You Liked ""Terminator 2,'"" You'll Like This","If you watched the first two movies in this ""series,"" particularly the second film, then most of this should be very familiar territory. You can expect to see more of the same, meaning:1 - Some spectacular action scenes; 2 - more action than is needed; 3 - A supposedly-unstoppable villain robot (this time a female); 3 - profane and somewhat annoying lead characters, except for Arnold, of course; 4 - seeing some naked butts (odd knowing one is the governor of Califronia); 5 - humor mixed in with all the violence; 6 - great overall special-effects and surround sound.The first 30 minutes of this movie was the best part, I thought. Overall, there was so much action it wore me out but it was a worthy sequel to the last movie. If you enjoyed watching what the ""bad cyborg"" Robert Patrick could do in the ""Terminator 2,"" you'll really be entertained by his successor, played by Kristannia Loken. Like Patrick, she doesn't say much....but doesn't have to. Schwarzenegger, meanwhile, performs admirably in his last starring role (I think) before tackling bigger responsibilities in real life.I hope there are no more re-makes because it wouldn't be the same without Arnold.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A little less action a little more conversation?,This film was almost as good a sequel to T2 without Jim Cameron.

I don't remember a dull moment.,"This was an outstanding movie. I enjoy both action films and comedy films. I couldn't help but laugh at Arnold's robotic comments to us (the inferior human race) as there were so nonemotional and .. well.. robotic.  Telling Kate Brewster to (essentially) shutup in the back of the stolen truck had me dying in laughter, since I could imagine the governor saying that to his kids in the backseat of a minivan.Okay, enough of my sarcasm -- this was just a great, nonstop action movie. I didn't see the first, really liked the second, but the third (and I'd guess final, since our lead character is both getting old and in politics) will be the highlight of the series.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Falls short of T1, way short of T2","I went into this movie hoping to be surprised if not downright delighted at what I was seeing.  I had hoped that it wouldn't be just another Hollywood big budget sequel that falls short of anything above average.  I was, however, very disappointed with what I saw.  It was just another Hollywood sequel that had little to add to the first two movies.I was not, however, totally put off by the film.  There were some excellent sequences that deserve the proper recognition.  The crane chase was creative and entertaining.  A few other ideas that I won't mention were good, along with the introduction to skynet, but these were not enough.  I didn't feel the same intensity that T2 brought me, or the sense of originality that T1 gave to me.The movie runs short, less than two hours.  The dialogue seemed a little cheap.  But worst of all, the story was second rate.  For as much money as they spent, they could make sure everything is excellent, not just the special effects.  If you want nonstop action, by all means see this movie. If you want a thought provoking epic, look elsewhere. 6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
An Honest Review,"Well... I kind of feel like giving this 10 stars based on Salvation and, especially, Genisys. I mean, in retrospect, compared to those two, it actually feels like you are watching a really good movie doesn't it?It has a plot that actually makes sense, and, unlike Genisys, it fits into the greater Terminator story without changing everything just to, well, just to change the entire canon and story for the sake of... what? I honestly don't know.However, when you compare it to Terminator and T2, it actually seems like you are watching a horrible movie. Nick Stahl was possibly the worst person to play John Conner they could have cast, Sarah Coner is gone (and with her the protagonist everyone loved) and Claire Danes just doesn't seem to know what she's doing in the film.Not only that, but Stahl comes across as the worst possible leader on earth... and he's the one that is supposed to be the legend that finally beats the machines? Seriously? Him?It might have been better if the Terminatrix was in it for more than a blink of the eye, but she kind of takes a back seat to everything else that is going on and leaves us wondering why they even added her into the movie.Ultimately, it's not a good film.

Arnold for governor,"It's unfortunate that movie opens with an intro that doesn't make much sence. Sure you get some information about judgement day as we all know it's what this movie is about. But after there short intro, you just get thrown into some action scenes with arnold vs Kristanna. And the story is left open for the second part of the movie. A very unfortunate factor according to me as I was sitting there waiting for the story while they were trashing vehicles and blowing up s***.However terminator three makes a good story after and the plot is nice. But try to tell the story of the movie to a friend. For some movies you can talk an hour. You need minute maximum to explain everything with this one. That's why I didn't really like the movie.Terminator is still one of the classics and excellent to see with a nice bag of popcorn.One thing is for sure... Arnold will be back, cause the movie just screams for another sequel. (If that'll be with arnold again as governors don't get too much time to act i guess ;) ).",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
The T-X,"I think one of the best things about about T3 was Kristanna Loken, even if she did have less lines and things to do than the other evil terminators, she still did very very well with what she was given. Personally I think she did a great job. If they make a T4 I hope she is in it but with a bigger role. I also thought that Nick Stahl was quite good. He seemed to come across as quite vunerable though which I wasn't expecting and after a few years on the run you'd think he'd be a little less naive (for lack of a better word). All in all I really loved this movie, I saw it twice in the cinema and would go again if I could. I can't wait for the DVD, I'd like to see some deleted scenes... maybe there were a lot of ones that Kristanna had that were deleted which would explain why she wasn't as scary as the other evil ones. Actually because she had less to do I felt her character more as a ""human"" than a terminator. She really did try to get her missions done and she did manage to kill the other leaders so she wasn't all bad. And for someone who hasn't done any major body training in a while, Arnie toned up pretty good, but if they get around to making a fourth film... if the timing is going the same way it has been (one a decade) hes going to be more than 65 years old by the time they make it! Claire Danes could have had more of a role... and I really want to know, in the trailer, what's the name of the music right before the end? I think it's the third piece of music to be played (when Kristanna is programming the robot) because I like that piece of music very much.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

"Yes naysayers, it IS better than T2!!!","They said it couldn't be done. No James Cameron. No Linda Hamilton. No Edward Furlong. Arnold well past his prime, both physically, and as a box-office powerhouse. All the early buzz indicated a disaster. But I knew, I felt it in my bones, that this film would be great. Why? Because too many people said it couldn't be done. It's always the way it works. When hype builds a movie up, and everyone is expecting too much (ala Matrix Reloaded), everyone is bound for a letdown. When all hope seems lost, and everyone's expectations are at their lowest, are we then surprised. So thank you all you T3 bashers, you have made me look like prophet! Terminator 3 is not only the best movie so far this summer, it stands head and shoulders above Terminator 2! It actually benefits from Cameron, Hamilton, and Furlong being absent. Camerson has become a Titanic-hugging hacked that peaked years ago. Terminator 1, Aliens, and The Abyss are all masterpieces. He's been on a downhill slide ever since. Sorry Motion Picture Academy, but Titanic sucked the big one. Someone tell me what Linda Hamilton has done besides the Terminator films that is worth watching......I'm waiting.....Thought so. She may have morphed from a whiny waitress, to a female Rambo, but there was nothing else for that character to do. Besides, for all her toughness in T2, she was a much more interesting character in the original. Finally, don't get me started on Edward Furlong. In T2, he was a whiny little bitch that I wished would get killed. He tried to come across as tough, but Furlong is such a bad actor, that he was laughable. T2 also relied too heavily on it's ""ooh"" and ""aahh"" fx. Yes they were spectacular and innovative, but it was too cool to be threatening. Now this is not to say that I didn't like T2. I did. Just not nearly as much as the first. Now comes T3 and the series has been given an incredible kick start. Kudos to the director, Jonathan Mostow. It is my opinion that Mr. Mostow is one of the hottest directors working today. His previous films, Breakdown and U-571, both breathed new life into their respective genres, and T3 is no exception. Mostow does not attempt to be Cameron, and the movie is all the better for it. Mostow brings his own style to the table, and the results are spectacular. The cinematography, editing, and pacing are all top notch. And the action sequences? Incredible! There is a vehicle chase at the beginning of this movie (I hesitate to say ""car chase"" because cars don't really factor into it, unless they are getting demolished) that is awe inspiring. This is what the chase in Matrix Reloaded WANTED to be. It ranks as one of the best chase scenes in movie history. Right up there with The French Connection and The Road Warrior. There is also a brawl between the T-101 and T-X in a public restroom that goes all out. Great stuff. Now what would this movie be without characters? Nick Stahl is PERFECT as John Connor. Now a tortured soul, too torn up by the past to be hopeful of the future, Stahl let's it all hang out. He let's you feel everything Connor does. Hoping for the best, but all the while you feel that fate is going to catch up with you sooner or later. Claire Danes, who I have never been a big fan of, also shines. She is in full Linda Hamilton mode, but better. She is a caring person, but proves that she's tough as nails when the chips are down. Bravo, Ms. Danes. Arnold. What can I say about the man? He may have been away from the character for 10 years, but you'd never know it. Arnold is the Terminator. Now doubts about it. Welcome back Mr. Schwarzenegger, you've been gone too long. Now as for Arnold's nemesis, we have Kristanna Loken as the T-X. Quite simply she, with the exception of Mostow, had the most work cut out for her in this movie. Everyone know what to expect from Arnold. But it is a rule of action movies that they are only as good as their villian. Robert Patrick had the benefit of brand-new CG technology to back him up. While his performance was good, (Especially how he NEVER blinks his eyes while firing a gun. I'd like to see you try that. If you've never noticed, watch T2 and check it out) as I said before, the effects made him more cool than threatening. Now we have Ms. Loken. People scoffed at the idea of a female Terminator to begin with. SO the deck was really stacked against her. Well have no fear, the T-X is here, and she is as bad-ass as they come. Not only can she go toe-to-toe with Arnie, not only can she morph like the T-1000, but she has more than a few tricks up her sleeve. She can reprogram machines, manufature weapons from her arm, and remote control vehicles to really give you a run for your money. She is also one of the most INCREDIBLY beautiul women you will ever see. That adds to her manace, because she has the power of a woman's seductivness on her side, and believe me she uses it. Her beaufiul, icy stare is at once mesmerizing, and terrifying when you realize what is behind those eyes. Way to go Kristanna. Everyone gives their all. The director, actors, and the FX department. But unlike T2, they don't overuse the CG effects. They utilize many styles. GC, miniature work, makeup fx, mechanical effects, and good old-fashioned stunt work. As I said earlier, the chase scene is incredible. Even more so when you realize how much of it was done for real. Simply spectacular. What this movie also has, unlike T2, is the tension of the original film. In T2, you simply dont care about the people. They are only backdrop to the action and fx. Not so here. The makers realized that the characters needed to be as flushed out as the action. That brings the tension level up ten fold. Just like the original. So is it as good as the original? No. But then it couldn't be. So it doesn't try to be. BUT it is a damn great movie, and a big improvement over T2. The best praise I can give it is....BRING ON TERMINATOR 4!!!!!!!!!!!!!",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
How dare they!?,"Considering what happens at the end of 'T2', everything that happens in Terminator 3 is impossible (don't even get me started). This fact alone should be a good enough reason why not to make this movie and rob the other two films of their dignity. Terminator 3 does practically everything wrong, but the worst thing it does is leave the story open for Terminator 4 (or what we now know as Terminator Salvation)The best way to summarize Terminator 3 is to say that this movie shows us how the war between man and machine begins, and how John Conner becomes the one who is destined to save mankind. This may sound like an exciting premise, but it results in a movie that does not belong anywhere near Jim Cameron's genius creations.The script is rubbish. It literally steals plot points from Terminator and T2, and then attempts to make a better movie out of them by adding more mindless action and special effects, neither of which is remotely useful to the story. Instead of being thrilling and epic, the action sequences are confusing and rather dull. The acting is terrible, and the characterization is even worse. The protagonists do virtually nothing but fight, and fight, and fight, and try to survive. It all happens so fast with no character interaction, no suspense, no adventure, and no emotion.

"Why, why, why?","I am writing this review fresh from visiting my local multiplex, viewing the latest installment of the Terminator series ""T3: Rise of the Machines"". I am a huge fan of the first two films directed by James Cameron and can only feel sympathy for Jonothan Mostow in trying to fill those boots. But then I just ask why did he bother? Cameron wrapped the whole story up very well in the sad conclusion of T2, and I can see why he baulked at the opportunity of helming a second sequel. I can see it even more when he read the script for T3. You can only imagine the meeting. 'Hi Mr. Cameron we would like to look at our script for T3'. 'A script for T3. But that was my idea. I thought up the whole thing. Why are you making a sequel to something I ended so brilliantly the first time around?'. 'Yes Mr. Cameron, but there's going to be lots of special effects...and a big car chase...and, er'. This was the biggest problem, although The Terminator and T2 by genre are a horror and a action film respectively, Cameron did convey a convincing moral message about the future of humanity, in his storyline through the relationships of his central characters to one another. This was shown through Reece's love for Sarah Conner (which even transends time) and the most human trait of all being a mother's love for her son, between Sarah and her son John. Apposed to these very human relationships is the cold, destructive, emotionless machine, the Terminator. Unfortunatly these elements had been threwn out in the script for this film, and therefore nothing for the viewer to attach themselves too. As for the cast Arnie was dependably wooden as ever for the role of the T-101 (how he kept a straight face for some of the one liners IS amazing). I haven't seen much of Nick Stahl (played John Conner)before but he seemed wrong for the role (didn't seem to have the street smarts Ed Furlong had in T2) and Care Danes seemed to be confused as to what her role was supposed to be. The one saving grace of this film was Kristanna Loken as the T-X. She stole the film (don't the bad guys always do this?) and looked like she really relished the role, I thought she was a real jewel. Hats of again to ILM, who although not superceding anything the Matrix sequels have done (I'm assuming Matrix Revolutions will blow our socks off), they continue to impress. So overall, I thought T:3 was a bit of a waste of time, and Mr. Cameron will probably be sat smugly thinking 'I knew I was right all along!'",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"A poor sequel to a wonderful series, a joke of a Terminator movie.","It's a shame, this movie started off so well, and with so much promise, despite the concern as to the absence of James Cameron, I thought the plot looked good and Arnie was back.However, it really quickly turned into a joke of a Terminator movie. Not much brooding terror as the Terminator entered the present day again; comic laughs were played for from the outset. Surely Leslie Nielson was due in at any second?Saying that, there were some of the original elements still there, the darkness; the downside to the story; the future twist that was yet to happen and you'd probably never see, and the human moments while the excitement was still thick in the air. Unfortunately, many of these were just swept over quickly in short bursts of dialogue to make way for another huge set piece.Not that the set pieces weren't amazing, it's just that by the end of the film, you feel that it was almost all a collection of set pieces. The audience was hardly given time to digest the shocking revelation from the Terminator, nor did any of the characters discuss it before heading off into the fight again.The other thing that hit me were the completely corny moments, two in particular stand out, the chance meeting of John Connor and his old school chum. How amazing was that considering that John Connor continually keeps moving and never stays in the same place? Then there was the need for the new Terminator to announce her findings of the DNA sampling to absolutely no one, despite the audience having already seen them flashed across her computer enhanced vision. American audiences I assume.In fact, the new Terminator isn't that scary or foreboding, and often she looks clumsy and awkward. Not a patch on the Terminator in T3, in fact none of the characters live up to their predecessors.I have heard talk of more sequels. I can only pray that James Cameron is out there, reading these, having watched the film, and decides he can't let the series be butchered again.

fortunately i got in for free,"i was so hyped up to see this movie. from the day i first heard it was announced to the week of its release, it was the one movie i was actually looking forward to. buddy of mine that worked at our local cinema-plex got me in for free and i sat down with only the best of intentions. i knew something was wrong the minute the opening credits came up and ""holy sh*t?! wheres the all to familiar Terminator theme by Brad Fiedel?"" i almost wanted to cry. by the end of the movies i had more questions than just those to ask. like why did they send poor Arnold's model back to fight off the T-X? the t-800 vs. the t-1000 wasnt so bad and it put Arnold at a little disadvantage and made him have to outwit the thing. if they were even, then it wouldnt have been interesting. but the t-800 vs. the t-x wasnt even remotely fair. its like a toaster vs. a flamethrower. what the hell were the story writers thinking?acting wise, the movie was average. Arnold played his part as the emotionless cyborg excellently as usual. Nick Stahl was pretty convincing as the future leader John Connor and Claire Danes was just there. nothing really standing out in her role. Newcomer Kristanna Loken played the T-X very well. Unfortunately the new female terminator just didnt seem as terrifying as the previous terminators and really didnt give you that sense of hopelessness and despair as Robert Patrick's and Arnold's previous terminator roles did. you wanna be scared of the terminator, not drool over it. but i guess that was the whole point. drool and be scared at the same time.overall, Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines was an entertaining summer flick and one of the better big-budget action movies released in a while. the ending was one that made you think yet very dissapointing. kinda like terminator sorta kinda maybe 2.5. i think James Cameron's direction would have been much better. an average action flick with the Terminator name stamped on it.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

"As good as T2, but great in it's own right","Jonathan Mostow has done what some call impossible: he has matched the direction of James Cameron in Cameron's own series. Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines is an amazing visual spectacle as well as a story driven film. Mostow stages some amazing combat sequences, and Arnold is on top of his game in the role that made him famous. The script is well written, with classic Schwarzenegger one lines, and the repetition of the line ""She'll be back"" actually works. The movie is peppered with humor and smart dialogue. The story actually makes sense in the timeline, although taking some liberties. Instead of a vote of 10 the reason this film gets a 9 by me is that the action sometimes seems to take center stage, although it drives the story along. One scene comes to mind when the T-850 drives a truck through a wall, suddenly fuel barrels explode. The Terminatrix is an imposing villain, definitely a great screen character. Kristanna Loken's icy blue eyes truly make the T-X a menacing villain that you grow to hate. Nick Stahl plays John Connor as he should be; a boy who knows what he's destined to do but questions why he was chosen, and resents it every minute of his life. Overall the action and script are great, the direction is excellent, and Arnold breaks the slump of bad movies. Definitely a worthy sequel to a great franchise, unlike the disappointing Matrix Reloaded. No T4!!!(You'll understand when you see the movie, especially the ending)",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A great second sequel,"After watching T3 for the first time I thought I would write up my review.T3 kicks off with an introduction by John Conner describing the way he has lived his life since the last installment, this sets up the story without having to reintroduce his character. This allows the action to flow, and boy does it come at you non-stop, watch out for the street chase, unlike another film that I will not mention, the stunts were actually done for real. T1 was an awe-inspiring concept of a story and held no punches with the violence. T2 was an epical science fiction special/visual effects extravaganza. T3 tends to fall in between in terms of violence and visual/special effects with a hint more humour than T3, most of it blatant.The length of the film is shorter than its predecessor to ensure the film never lets up. The storyline is similar to T2 but has other elements added in to ensure that is also interesting.Overall it's a fantastic film in my opinion, it does differ to the other two installments, but this helps to ensure that things don't become stale, although it does fall slightly short of T2 but not much.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

The action was great, and if you look at the trivia, there was one scene they were going to cut because of cost and running behind budget, but Arnold lowered his price tag by a million so they could do the shot.  It was well worth the million.  Overall, if you've seen the first two, don't expect the same ratios of action and dialogue, but it is still a good movie, and well worth the matinee price I paid for it ;-).",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
good but not great,"While this was an enjoyable movie, it did not have the amazing feel of The Terminator and Terminator 2 Judgement Day.

I liked Nick Stahl's John Connor better than Edward Furlong, but Kristanna Loken's Terminator wasn't half as menacing or as cool as Robert Patrick's was. I enjoyed it more than T1, but it's still not quite as good as T2. Overall I give it ***1/2 out of four stars.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
It was good until the ending.,"There were lots of good things about the movie.  I liked the new villain, Kristanna Loken.  Nick Stahl and Claire Danes were good, and of course Arnold Schwarzenegger was on top of his game.But the ending didn't seem to fit.  It was like they were filming one day and the director was told he only had five minutes to wrap up filming, so he threw something together.

9 on a scale of 10,"I really have no complaints about this movie. I had been wanting to see it for quite awhile and finally rented it on CD. I liked it at least as well as the others. Probably more. I've been in the mood for action lately. Action starved. Too many Beaches movies. And, this movie has action. In fact, I remember several times thinking that I couldn't look away even for a moment afraid of what I would miss. That's the definition of action in my book.Unlike a lot of action movies, it wasn't just mindless mayhem. Each individual scene had a point --- in addition to the mindless mayhem. I even liked the plot quite a bit. Logical. And, I love movies that mess with the time line as long as it makes sense.The other nice thing about T-3 is that it set us up for T-4, T-5, etc. I don't know exactly how Arnold is going to do it since by the time he gets out of politics, he won't look anywhere near as chiseled and it will be hard to believe he is the best the robots have to offer. I would still like to see him have a role, but since robots don't age, it might be tough.All in all, excellent mayhem of the first-rate mindless variety.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Great fun,"I just saw this movie, and had a great time.  Once again, The Terminator is back, along with an extremely hot T-X, played by Kristanna Loken.  Great action scenes, raw violence, and more than adequate acting carry it very well.  Not as original as the first two, but still comes up with creative fight scenes.  A fair amount of amusing dialogue is also present.  Overall, very enjoyable, and quite well made.  I would recommend it to most people, and give it an 8.6 out of 10, or 9 out of 10.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Disappointing!,"I had heard great reviews about this movie, I wasn't terribly sure whether they should have made a 3rd installment to the already successful ""Terminator"" movies. After watching this film, this is the opinion that I have: this movie doesn't even compare to the brilliance that was the first two movies. Despite Nick Stahl and Claire Danes doing a great job as John Connor and Kate Brewster, I thought their storyline way way too soft. Arnold Schwarzenegger was good in his role as the T-800, however he looked as if he didn't have the same interest in playing the role. This T-800 lacked the character that he had in the previous movies despite the notion that he's coming back as different models. I thought that Kristanna Loken was weak as the TX-Terminatrix, not even close to being as sinister as Arnie was in the first movie and Robert Patrick as the T-1000 in the second movie. It's plainly obvious that she was chosen for the role to entice males into watching this movie and also maybe to show that women are strong etc. I'm a woman and I wasn't impressed by her at all, a man should have played the villain or better yet Robert Patrick as a stronger terminator model.Don't expect anything like the first two installments, the only thing that stuck to true terminator style was the truck scene. Other than that you wouldn't even think you were watching a ""Terminator"" film.Truly disappointing....",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
I actually wanted more of a story,"Just to let you know, I am a die-hard Terminator fan.  Have been ever since the 1st movie.  I collect the comics and have read all the T2 books by S. M. Stirling (like T2: Infiltrator).  I actually wanted more a story than I got in T3.  There is no doubt T3 is a great action movie, and who doesn't love the female Terminator?  But I guess I did miss the Sara Connor character. In T3, John Connor came across as too much of a wimpy cry baby.  The Sara Connor from T2 would have continued to train John on how to survive ""Judgment Day"".  Overall I was a little disappointed in T3.  To me it was too short (barely 100 minutes), I wanted a more developed story line (like what was happening in the future and that sort of stuff), and I wanted Linda Hamilton back.  I will end up buying the T3 DVD when it comes out, and I can only hope they make a T4, so we can see how the war against the machines really ends.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Schwarzenegger 's Back,"After seeing the first two terminator films I couldn't wait to see the third installment in the franchise that made Arnold Schwarzenegger a hit. T3 lives up to the reputation of the previous movies with more special effects and action sequences than before.10 years have passed since John Connor (Stahl) helped to blow up Cyberdyne Systems and stop judgment day now 23 years old he lives a quiet existence, no credit cards, phone, address or home. He is trying to escape the future and his destiny meanwhile a new terminator called the T-X (Loken) has been sent to eliminate his lieutenants including Kate Brewster (Danes) who will be an important part of the resistance and later become John's wife. But another terminator called the T-850 (Schwarzenegger) has also arrived to protect both John & Kate and ensure their survival. However the terminator informs him that judgment day wasn't stopped and the inevitable will happen , the T-X is also after Kate's father Robert Brewster(Andrews) the original creator of Skynet that's the virus that's infected everything from computers to satellites and when the machines take control chaos follows. Nick Stahl's performance as John Connor was both electrifying and good.

The beginning of the end,"Re-watching this film in 2020 after all the sequels and re-quels makes so much more sense since it gives you a clear picture of when and where it all started. I'm talking about the parasitism of the Terminator franchise.Obviously, every film after the first one is the same exact film, yet if Terminator 2 was a superior big-budget refined version of the first one, every other film after it was just a lesser version of T2 (except for Salvation, which was a slightly different take but still bad).Interestingly enough, when I watched Genisys in the theatre I thought that this idea of re-shooting the classic ones frame-by-frame is just a sign of creative bankruptcy that the franchise has come to.Then Dark Fate came out, and it was exactly the same film as T2 scene-by-scene with different backdrops and CGI. There was little to no original content in that. I have a detailed review of the Dark Fate as well.And now, after re-watching Rise of the Machines, the picture is finally clear in my mind. The franchise was never supposed to live past T2, the story was over, and this film shows it.Rise of the Machines is a cheesy badly written rehash of T2 with horrible CGI that was never good and doesn't hold up in 2020.There are some redeeming factors like the insane car chase with actual physical stunts which looks great even in 2020, and the ending was surprisingly good for a horribly written story like this.And of course, Arnie was great to look at, even though his character is a comically large dumb robot, which is what our beloved Terminator has become after this film in all the sequels that feature real Arnie, both Genisys, and Dark Fate made him a joke as well.There should have never been a T2 sequel. We stopped Judgement Day but found ourselves in a Garbage Day.",5.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Take it for what it is,"I have come across quite a few people who disliked this movie. Their reasons are numerous: plot holes, it destroys the continuity, etc. I could go on and on but I will not do that here.I think the biggest problem that most people had going into this film was that they were expecting it to be something that it wasn't. They were expecting this movie to be another Terminator 2: Judgment Day. This movie, I believe, was never meant to be that. It did have likenesses to the other movies such as action sequences, time travel, etc. However, this movie needs to be judged on its' own merits and not that of the two movies preceding it, to do this is about as intelligent as judging a child against the performance of his/her siblings.I think that all parties involved in the making of this film did an excellent job in making a film that held up rather well. A good job was done of creating something that added to the Terminator storyline but still was original enough to be a good movie in its own right. Some familiar concepts in the Terminator Universe were taken and expanded on or better defined. It seems that most of the problems that I have heard from others who have viewed the film have come from their own preconceived ideas about what certain aspects of the film or Terminator Universe should be and not from the film itself.Therefore my recommendation about this movie is to simply take the film for what it is, entertainment. This is a good phrase to sum up what I think. As entertainment this movie holds up rather well. Take it for what it is and enjoy it. Don't beat your brain out trying to understand it because it is only a movie. Overall I think this was a good movie 7/10",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Entertaining film but not at the hieghts of the originals,"Terminator 3 is a classic case of one film too far, but not because it's an appauling film. In fact, so far it's one of my favorite films this year. It has (obviously) some fantastic action sequences, reasonable plot and some meorable scenes. The reason it's one film too far is because to try and compete with its originals and make just as fantastic film is a very, very tough job indeed. Terminators 1 and 2 were grounbreaking films which truly deserve to be in the top 100 films of all time. Sadly, T3 is not. It lacks the character relationship T2 had, the acting ability of Michael bienh (T1) or Hamilton (who is sadly missed in this film), and the new terminator is not played anywhere near as well as Robert Patrick's menacing T-1000 from judgement day. In short, Terminator 3 is an all-out action, thorogughly entertaining film but with poorer acting, and a lesser plot and script. By all means go and watch it, but don't expect anything particularly special. A great saga overall, but i feel that it's finally Hasta La vista, baby.Jas",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Not a bad follow up - just not as good as the first two.,"What had to be the toughest job in making T3 was developing a good enough bad guy.  Surprisingly, that is the best part of T3.  They did it right.  Don't think so?  You try to come up with a better bad guy.  It ain't easy. The action was pretty solid and the movie doesn't waste time getting uncorked.  There are very few slow points to the movie. The plot has holes in it.  So what?  It's good enough to support the action and it's pretty hard to come up with a time travel plot that doesn't have holes in it.  Only Bill and Ted could manage most excellent time travel. Bottom line:   Action was solid, direction was pretty good, the acting wasn't as good as T2 and the music didn't have the drive of either of the first two.  So - - not as good as the first two but definitely worth the admission price.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Decent action but doesn't live up to the Terminator legend,"All the action but almost none of the story...The Hollywood pattern is alive and well in T3.What pattern?  That Hollywood cannot follow up classics with similar quality.  That Hollywood cannot remake a movie or a legend and preserve the power or depth of the original storyline.  That Hollywood will almost always place effects and action above good storytelling.T3 had good ""Terminator action"".  As we would expect with T3's budget and current FX technology, the fight and sequences were great eye candy. Certainly, that's one ingredient of the Terminator movies.  However, unlike T2, there was nothing groundbreaking or cutting edge here.As for the story; well... let me not belabor the details.  That would not be fair, as T3 made itself such an easy target.  Suffice it to say the story doesn't live up to the two Terminator predecessors.  The overall story was pale, indeed, compared with T1 and T2.  Add to that more plot holes that a T-800's flesh covering has at the end of each movie.  Even the dates don't add up when John talks about his age as various events occur.  It was a barely above average plot with very little care given to the details. Barely above average for movies in general; but T1 and T2 were well above average.The directing struck me as average.  Sure, there were some great action sequences, especially in the chase scenes.  Nonetheless, the camera angles, the lighting, the gripping photgraphy; all those elements which Cameron added in T1 and T2 just were not present in T3.  The overall ""artistry"" was competent but inferior to T1 & T2.Acting was decent, with the exception of the T-X.  Loken had the look and knows how to strike a pose but when she spoke, she just didn't grip me. Neither her voice nor articulation added to the mystery or the menace which should be the T-X.All in all, this is a movie worth watching.  As I mentioned, the action and FX are good.  There are some great lines and a couple moments of visual humour.  Where this movie fails is that it does not live up to its legend, especially after a haitus of many years.  Indeed, it was reminicient of Star Wars Episode I in that respect.Utlimately it's worth watching but I would consider this installment to be a major letdown considering that we waited 12 years hoping for a movie of at least similar quality to T2.",3.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Comments about Nick Stahl as John Connor,"I've read some of the comments here about how Nick Stahl just didn't work for people as John Connor.  I just rewatched the movie again on DVD and I think I've figured it out.  They tuned out the characters.Think about what kind of life John Connor had to have while growing up - his Mom is in an insane asylum until he's 10/13.  So he's part of the foster care system.  Then all of a sudden he finds out all the BS that he's heard about himself is true - and it's all with a vengeance.  It's not like these activities take place over months - it's a couple of days for everything from T2 and that's it.  Then he lives with him Mom in Mexico until she dies.Now he's alone - ALL alone.  What kind of life would YOU make for yourself? 17 - you've watched your Mom die from leukemia (which is not a great thing to see in and of itself) - and you're told that when most of humanity is killed in a nuclear holocaust, that you're the leader of the survivors. Think that YOU might be a little bent out of shape and quite possibly not strong enough to take it?  Maybe even crawl into a bottle, or just run away from everything?That's what John did - as is shown at the start of the movie.  By the time he's hooked up with Arnold in the crypt, he's sick of it.  From his perspective, this is an intense amount of pressure to put on someone.  You HAVE to live, no matter what.  That's why at the end of the movie Kate Brewster (who has also had a REALLY rotten 13 hours, when you think about it - she shows up at the vet clinic at 0530 for what she thinks is a routine, albeit annoying emergency call, and by 1820 hours, she's been beat up, kidnapped, shot at, her fiance is dead, her father is dead, and told she's going to be the wife of John Connor and oh, yeah, she's the one who sent Arnie back in time because John is dead in the future - that's one HELL of a day) and John Connor have grown so much in character from the start of the movie.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Not Really Worthy Of Its Predecessors,"When the first 'Terminator' movie was released in 1984, the special effects were not that impressive, but the film had enough low-budget energy, enthusiasm and imagination on show that it made up for what it lacked from the technical aspects. 1991's mega-budget sequel was in many ways similar to the original, but with the wealth of spectacular, ground-breaking special effects on display, nobody really cared.This belated second sequel, however, brings nothing new to the formula other than the addition of a female 'Terminatrix'. The ageing Arnie is no longer the mean, lean fighting machine that was so threatening twenty-odd years ago, looking more like an awkward old relative that just keeps hanging about. Former model Kristanna Loken does a decent job as the 'Terminatrix' (or 'T-X'), although she doesn't really have to do a lot of acting other than looking mean and emotionless. (She looks fantastic, though!). Nick Stahl as John Connor lacks the charisma that Edward Furlong brought to the role in 'T2', but the faithful Claire Danes does a fine job as the love interest, Kate Brewster. The script, though, insistent on giving Arnie a constant stream of one-liners referring back to - or parodying - the previous two movies, only serves to keep reminding us how much better James Cameron's originals were.It does have its moments - there are some spectacular action sequences to be seen - but most of the time it only echoes what we've seen before. It may be worth seeing if you're an avid fan, but in the end it all feels a bit pointless. Rather than ending the series with a bang, it could have gone completely unnoticed.",5.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"visual masterpiece, if you like that kinda stuff...","the movie was conjested with action and special effects which took away from a strong plot line and good characters.  the visuals were excellent, although many things were regurgitated from the previous films.  many people will like this film for its stunning visual effects, and many people will hate it for its lack in good dialouge, plot, and characters.  i feel it would be worth while to see if you want to know what happens next in the terminator story, but dont expect the same feelings of intrigue or the same vibe from the characters like the cold, evil t-1000.  i think of t3 as a 'give the visual effects guys a bunch of money and see what they can do' kinda movie rather than a good sequel to a previously good movie.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Not the originals, but still pretty good.","The movie is set in John Connor's(Nick Stahl) young adulthood with Judgement Day pulling closer.

And once again, the terminator(Arnold Schwarzenegger)is back to protect.The movie is the third part of the story making it a trilogy finally and it, like most trilogies, isn't as good as the originals. Although it's not as good, the movie is still quite entertaining. The effects are just as good as Terminator 2: Judgement Day and the movie holds twists that make the movie quite sensational.

"Satisfying and Consistency Riveting, but Badly Acted","Struggling to hold the momentum of its inspired prequel, 'Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines' has to invent its own story that staggers somewhat but remains engaging throughout. This is largely due to director Jonathan Mostow's competent screenplay which translates effortlessly onto screen with a brisk and energetic pace which allows events to serve as exposition.Poor however is the overall acting. Arnold Schwarzenegger can hold up for the most part, but something about his makeup and performance feels off. Kristanna Loken's antagonist is badly conceived, however she is clearly having a lot of fun with the role and it translates well onto screen. However Nick Stahl is painfully underacting and Claire Danes is horribly overacting. The biggest pleasure is David Andrews who adds a lot of weight and gravitas to the final act.'Rise of the Machines' gets a lot of flack for existing and not respecting T2, but it actually does a fair job of standing on its own two feet and is a worthy addition overall to the franchise.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Terrible,"This film is a terrible letdown for what were an incredible first two films.

The fact that we have a woman terminator making mince meat out of Arnold (the figure) that James Cameron spent so much time making a legend of in the first to films.

It hard a hard act to follow.,"Actually, ""Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines"" had two hard acts to follow, and even though Arnold Schwarzenegger reprised his role, in a way, of the 'good' Terminator from T2, that excellent film's sequel had trouble living up to the franchise name.That's not to say it's a bad movie. Arnie is as deadpan as ever, Nick Stahl is fine as John Connor and the introduction of Claire Danes was also good. I liked Kristanna Loken as the Terminatrix, TX.Even the continuation of the Judgement Day storyline was well handed, and there were some very cool action sequences as well.I just kept comparing it, involuntarily, to ""The Terminator"" and ""Terminator 2: Judgement Day"".

Some good action but inferior to the original two,"John Connor (Nick Stahl) is a young man living off the grid as a drifter. He is still haunted by nightmares of an apocalyptic future. Future SkyNet sends back T-X (Kristanna Loken) to hunt down various people including Kate Brewster (Claire Danes).

Another Terminator (Arnold Schwarzenegger) arrives to protect John. John breaks into Kate's animal clinic to steal medicine. It turns out that they knew each other as teens before the original Terminator.This is not bigger and better than the other two. That is its biggest sin in the logic of sequels. It has some good action but it's not bigger than the second one. The car chase is lots of fun especially with real action. It doesn't bring anything new to the franchise. It is merely a continuation. Nick Stahl should have been a good lead. At least, the movie NEEDED him to be good. Instead, he's merely capable. Claire Danes is much better. The standout is Arnold who looks amazing at his age.

"He's back, AGAIN","Yes the Terminator returns for yet another go-round with the unrelenting machines. He will do some new stuff and a lot of stuff we've already seen, but hey, it's still good stuff.I personally enjoyed this film a lot, it lacked most of the first and second films depth, but it still respectable, especially considering it's the third film in the franchise. My friend and his dad also enjoyed the film, they agreed it didn't match the first two but that it was still a good film.This being the first ""Terminator"" movie I had seen I didn't know what to expect, I believed this helped me. Too many people compared this to the first two films and expected it to be the same, but it wasn't, it was actually a fairly good film, just not quite as good as the first two fantastic films. Because I had not seen the other two, I was able to see this one as a film and not just a stack up to the first two, thus I honestly believe it was a fairly good addition to the franchise.The T-X (Kristanna Loken) though amazing in concept didn't exactly carry the coldness that T2's T-000 had, the result being, she was not as effective as she should have been. The acting itself wasn't a perfect gem, but it carried the story like it needed too and there was no particularly large flaw in it.The reason that T3 wasn't as good as the previous movies is because it couldn't bear the emotional heavy lifting that its predecessors did. It didn't contain the emotional passion that Linda Hamilton gave to T2 or the gritty strength of Michael Biehn's Kyle Reese from the original ""Terminator"".T3 does redeem itself though, the ending is one of the most powerful endings to a movie I've ever seen (to the point that it felt slightly disjointed from the rest of the movie). Now I'm not going to spoil it for any viewer who hasn't seen this movie, but the ending of this film is a shocker, especially to fans of the series (Then again with Terminator Salvation out already, most people who haven't seen T3 would have figured it out by now).7.5/10 Very Good action film, see it.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

The future still dark... The action sequences were even better!

Trainwreck on all accounts,"I hate this movie. It sent the Terminator series down the toilet. Everything about this movie sucks. The score, acting, direction, effects, humor, etc. This is a pointless cash grab like the other trainwrecks after this movie. Avoid!

Ahhhnold's Back!,"T3 was a decent film despite the fact that I entered the theater with the false pretense that Mostow would be able to imitate Cameron's style in T1 and T2.  The only reason I could see the need to have a Terminatrix was for the sex appeal.  Had Robert Patrick (T- 1000) been brought back, the film would've been equally good, if not better. There were definitely some moments where Ahnold's one-liners were just hilarious. I would've liked to have seen a slightly stronger ending.  You'll never forget Sarah Connor driving off into the desert, or Ahnold sticking up his thumb as he's getting submerged in the hot steal.  But nukes being launched everywhere?Not sure if this will conclude the Terminator legacy, but if they do make another one, I'll definitely go see it.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Pretty funny action movie,"I liked this movie more than I thought I would. I have never been a huge fan of the Terminator movies (though I can appreciate the story and the FX) and so I wasn't thrilled about this rental, but....I just HAD to see it for myself. The story is a logical continuation of where T2 left off. Following suit, T3 tops the FX in T2 (the new bad guy is COOL)PLUS it's darn funny!!! I laughed through the whole thing!

"In a summer where film companies are dishing out loads of pointless sequels to mediocre movies, it's a big surprise when one of these sequels actually comes out as something other than a complete copy of it'","In a summer where film companies are dishing out loads of pointless sequels to mediocre movies, it's a big surprise when one of these sequels actually comes out as something other than a complete copy of it's predecessor. Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines succeeds where so many sequels fail: in originality. With the movie's star cast, fantastic action sequences and impressive story, it's not hard to guess that T3 will go down in film history as one of the most engaging action/sci-fi movies ever created.T3 focuses on John Connor (Nick Stahl), leader of the human resistance against the machines in a futuristic war-torn planet Earth. John, having stopped judgment day 12 years ago with the help of T-101 (Arnold Schwarzeneggar), has broken off all contact with the world and has become a drifter, knowing deep down that judgment day is still near. A new terminator, the T-X (Kristanna Loken) is sent into the present to kill John Connor and his future lieutenants. The story also involves Katherine Brewster (Claire Danes), a veterinarian's assistant who plays a key role in John Connor's life and the future of the resistance. Another T-101 is sent into the present to ensure the protection of John Connor and Katherine Brewster, and to lead them to safety before the coming of judgment day.The story to T3 is very strong, considering the fact that Terminator creator James Cameron is missing this time around. His replacement for this entry is Jonathan Mostow (U-571), who does a superb job in recreating James Cameron's vision of the future and of the machines who rule it. The story does a good job in answering questions such as why judgment day is still going to happen, and the roles that each character plays in the future. The story will make the viewer believe that there was a need to make this sequel, because there was still a story to tell.The actors in this movie stay true to their roles. Arnold is back, and although it's safe to say that this will probably be his last Terminator flick, he does a great job in reprising his role as the protector of John Connor. Edward Furlong, who played John in T2: Judgment Day, is missing this time around, but his replacement Nick Stahl keeps things going as the young man who still questions his role in life. Kristanna Loken is good as the Terminatrix. She brings the attitude and personality that Robert Patrick portrayed in T2. Claire Danes does a good job in her role, seeing that this is her first big role in an action movie.In conclusion, Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines is a top-notch action movie that does just about everything right. T3 brings the classic movies together into one unforgettable sequel that will be sure to please fans of the original movies.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

He should have considered not coming back,"In the grand scheme of Terminator films, this is the poor relation. It's been panned on various reviewing websites, and to some extent I can see why too - but I don't hate it, in fact if you give it a chance it's actually alright. In this film a new Terminator (T-X) is sent back in time to the past (our present) to complete another mission which will change its present (our future) and bring machines the victory in a war waged against humanity which has been blazing for a long time. John Connor is all grown up and living off the grid so he can't be hunted. While he isn't the intended target this time, he still manages to find himself on the run from the new super advanced T-X Terminator. Teaming up with his future wife Katherine Brewster, he is on his own mission to survive the conflict with the T-X, and to try and prevent the future from happening thus saving humanity.Some would argue this film raises more issues than it does solve them, but given the chance, and ignoring the numerous issues, this is a decent action film - not brilliant, just decent. The first Terminator film shows what imagination and storytelling, despite having a low budget , can do - a masterpiece. T2 shows what a big budget and a good imagination, despite only a decent story can achieve - another stroke of genius. T3 unfortunately, shows what a big budget but very little imagination and story can achieve - which ultimately doesn't get it to the heights of its two predecessors.There are times were it tries to give nods to previous films in the franchise, but in doing it once to many throughout the film it becomes a bit of a parody of itself. The cast in the film is decent enough, Arnie looks a little over aged for his role, but who else can you put in that role. Nick Stahl and Claire Danes do alright as the central humans in the film, but poor scripting means there isn't a massive amount to write home about. Kristanna Loken is a bit cartoony as the new terminator, which I'm not sure if it's down to an overuse of CGI on her - but still she is decent enough.Some of the issues I had included: T800's aren't supposed to be able to learn, yet Arnie's Terminator has learned plenty of new things. How is Skynet operational after John destroyed the core and every trace of previous Terminators. If Skynet can send Terminators back in time, as it has done plenty of times now (5 by my count), why not send an army of them back in time so that they can win this time? Why haven't the US Military got any security at its top secret facility, and more to the point, how can two young adults and their 6ft gun totting robot enter the facility without being accosted? I have plenty more issues, but I getting fed of myself whinging now.I enjoyed the twist at the end of this film more than I did the journey to get to that point, I enjoyed looking at some of the version 1 killing machines, I enjoyed the nostalgia this film brought. The biggest issue I had though is that this lacked balls, it didn't have attitude, it didn't feel right. I felt like a film for films sake, rather than a film for a great concept. Perhaps this got panned so much because of the great Terminator films which came before it. At best, for me, this is a 6 out of 10.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"The original crew dropped out, this is what happened","Being that there are so many points in Terminator 3:Rise of the Machines which could make you realize its a bad movie, its hard to determine the first one that really makes you give up all hope for the remaining hours. I'll help you because its really quite obvious; When Arnold pulls out shades from his leather jacket, puts them and realizes that (Ha Ha!) there star shaped!! Then he smirks and crunches them. If he had left them on you really wouldn't have noticed because the rest of the movie is spent with the bad-ass T-1000 cracking inside joke one-liners about how ""robotic"" he is.In an attempt to top T2000 (from T2), they decided that the cool metal skeleton robot could be covered by the really cool liquid metal to form the coolest robot ever! Obviously they realized how stupid that was and just decided to make it a hot chick who can do, literally, anything. You know where this is going because they recycled it from the second movie. John Connors must be saved blah blah blah. The few writing elements which are new to T3 are old to anyone who's seen a movie before.Even though Arnold has way too many lines for a killing machine, he still plays a great robot. Its easy to pick apart actors who play robots but this was always his best role and he does it better than anyone else. When she wasnt the butt of a joke or timing out the perfect punchline, Clair Danes delivers the only other believable performance in T3. I guess she slipped through the cracks because Nick Stahl and Krisstana Loken text book ""acted"" there way through the entire movie draining life out of the already decaying script.If you could orchestrate the perfect bad movie scene by scene you would inevitabley produce T3. It was exciting to watch. Each scene that went by I grew more and more excited to see how they could possibly make this movie any worse. Amazingly, through bad direction weak acting and horrendous writing, they did it! Too bad the Wayans brothers werent involved, at least then we would have known it was going to be a spoof.",1.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Hype terminates movies...,"...but strangely, in the lead-up to T3, I didn't encounter ANY of the saturation advertising. I heard about it: ""Hey, have you seen the trailer for T3? That T-X looks sooooo hot!"" But somehow it passed me by. The only hype I encountered was in my own mind. And that was mostly concern that it might suck. I was afraid Arnie might be past it. I was afraid the lack of Cameron panache might result in a lame sequel, rather than a great new instalment in a great series. But then I thought: That T-X looks sooooo hot! So I went to see it.And I'm glad I did. This is no epic like T2. But it's definitely a worthy addition to the franchise. It's more reminiscent of T1, in that it's like a low-budget, B-grade sci-fi actioner. With a bit of a brain. And a HUGE budget. My kind of movie.To my mind, the biggest (well, only) flaw with T2 was that Jim unwittingly created a sort of paradox. To wit: No Cyberdyne = No Skynet = No War = No Terminator = No Kyle Reece Time Travel Caper = No John Connor = No End To Cyberdyne = Skynet = War = Machines Win. Oops.T3, in explaining its premise (or justifying its existence) sort of solves this paradox. But in so doing, it creates a new one, concerning John's message to his mother in T1, the philosophy which becomes her driving force in T2. Maybe he was just being cheeky, seeing what crazy things his words might make her do. But then, maybe not.On top of introducing a new philosophical slant to proceedings, the folks behind T3 have expanded the story and introduced new characters, while keeping the cast quite small.The action sequences are AWESOME. One chase, involving a crane, a fire engine and several police cars, is one of the most spectacular (not to mention EXPENSIVE-LOOKING) I have seen in recent times. Mostly because there appear to be few visual effects involved. Not to mention HEAPS of wrecked cars.Arnie may be getting on, but he is still the Terminator. His skin may sag a little, but he's an old model. Surely Terminators get wrinkles. No-one else can punch through a wall like Arnie.Nick Stahl is fine as an older John Connor. I like the way the character is introduced. A lot has happened to him since he helped stop Judgement Day. And he's the worse for it. He starts out a little frazzled, then gets MORE frazzled as the situation escalates. Nick portrays this well.I have to admit, I had reservations about Claire Danes being in this movie, as it's not in keeping with her usual...thing. But she's playing a character who isn't used to being hunted by an evil robot (who is?), so it works out nicely. She plays frightened well.And Kristanna Loken? What can I say? You can keep your Xenia Onatopp and your Mystique. There's a new femme fatale in town. And she's a toughie, too. She has a grenade launcher in her hand! Literally! She can throw ARNIE around the room like a RAGDOLL! How can you beat that? The T-X is a clever combination of the solid T-101 (Arnie) and the liquid T-1000 (Robert Patrick). With boobs. Sheer genius.I went in expecting a lame action movie about an old man in leather. What I got was a surprisingly good (REALLY good) Terminator movie, that left me wanting a T4.Is it inevitable? The future will decide...",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Not as good as the others.,"This movie could have been better, there were too many one liner gimmicks and too much comic relief.

Good But Not As Good As First Two,"Terminator 3 has several strengths.  I think the actor playing John Connor is very good.  Claire Danes is very good as the woman caught up in the mayhem.  The movie also has very good action scenes.  Best of all, it comes in at about two hours, which comes as a welcome relief for those who thought movies like ""Matrix Reloaded"" and ""Hulk"" would never end.  Therefore, I recommend this movie.  However, the movie is not as good as the first two movies, which are classics.  As good as the actor playing John Connor is, he is not as good as Eddie Furlong in the same role in ""Terminator 2.""  I also really missed Linda Hamilton who anchored the first two movies.  The new villain in T3 is not nearly as menancing as the T-1000 in ""Terminator 2"" probably because Robert Patrick is a better actor than the one they have in T3.  Finally, I was not crazy about the ending.  I will give nothing away, but it is a real disappointment.  I honestly don't know how audiences will respond to this ending.  I think they will be disappointed.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
unworthy successor,"first off, i'd like to say that as purely an action sci-fi flick, t3 has enough firepower to blow u away. explosions aplenty, and a t-x babe to ogle at. wat more could a guy ask for? plenty more in fact. cut to the chase. t3 lacks the depth of the previous 2 terminator movies. its purely action and just a lil develpoment of storyline to set up for t4. the feelings n emotion werent half as strong as compared to t1 n 2, and i feel they really focused too much on action, throwing plot out the window. it is that mix of emotion and suspense that really made the first 2 classics, and it is sadly lacking here. the t-x wasnt as remotely scary as the t-1000 played by Robert Patrick and i felt that t3 really could have done without those awful one-liners. the mood of t3 just doesnt provide for it, and putting the funny moments just felt awkard. all in all, im really surprised they took 12 yrs to come up with nothing more than a summer popcorn flick. hope t4's good enuff to let me forget this.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Doesn't compare to the first 2, but still fun","Comparing this to the originals is a no win situation. It's inferior to both, but still a solid entry.

I feared this movie would be a total piece of garbage, so my expectations weren't high. Because I wasn't anticipating a ""bar raising"" entry into the series I think it allowed me to enjoy it for what it was. It's Terminator Light...less thought goes into it and the pacing just screams forward. The frantic pace actually helps distract you from the problems with the script/plot. It's all about the action and nostalgic humor. You will have fun when you see this, but don't expect anything resembling the masterpiece of T2 that Cameron crafted. Oh, and Kristanna Loken is easily the hottest robot that has ever graced film...and she is entirely believable in her role.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Surprisingly great 3rd installment,"I have to say that I was not expecting a great movie with T3 ""Rise of the Machines"".  I was biased, thinking James Cameron was necessary to make it a success, but I was wrong.  The Terminator Story has taken a life of its own! It has evolved from the simple story-line of a single terminator trying to kill Sarah Connor to Skynet trying to kill all human life.  It is huge and the potential is vast.  Arnold Schwarzenegger's presence on screen was incredible.  For 55 years old, he is in excellent shape.  I highly recommend this movie to folks like me who don't think any movie can top T1 and T2. This movie isn't meant to top it, just continue it, and it does that very well.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Popcorn Fodder,"First off the positives this film has some of the most over the top action sequences ever.  Like or loathe this movie it will make you sit back and go wow!! every once in a while.  Also despite some of the negative comments i've seen Arnie doesn't do a bad job of reprising his role as the Terminator.The main problems I found with this film is that you never really care weather the main protagonists get killed or not.  The whole movie feels like a re-hash of Terminator 2, the movie never stops moving and what interaction there is between the characters is normally conducted during a car chase.If they had added maybe 10mins to the runtime and introduced a couple of slower scenes I feel it would have helped the movie and made the wow! moments more effective.  There are some glaring plot inconsistancies between this Terminator 1 and T2 which have been discussed in detail elsewhere. But to be honest this film is not trying to be Citizen Caine, it's trying to be a big dumb action movie and in that respect it succeeds.Overall it's not a bad movie, but it's not great either.  It's perfect cinema or DVD rental popcorn fodder.  Sit back enjoy the action and don't think too hard and you'll get an enjoyable evenings entertainment, does what it set out to do and no more 6/10.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Decent script.  Weak Execution.,"Having seen this film 12 years after the great T2, I was hoping to feel as involved in the characters and feel the realism of the action like I did in T2, but I felt nothing, from start to finish.  I didn't feel like this was a terminator movie.  This was more of a TV pilot to translate T2 into a show for Showtime.The storyline is surprisingly decent, but not very strong and catchy.  It ultimately feels conveluted and made up only to make more money and not to continue the story.  It's like hiring a soap opera writer to create a sequel to Romeo & Juliet.  I liked the ""future wife"" aspect of the story, and making Judgement Day inevitable just took everything we were told to believe in the second film, and threw it out.  So much for the whole moral of ""There's no fate but what we make for ourselves"".  I guess you can't make much more money if you end the series that way, so they ignored it, and squeezed this one out of an orafice.The Connor family that we've grown to care about was suddenly gone, with only a glued-on backstory to explain the changes.The new John Connor has no or little tension in his acting.  Nothing about him makes me feel he's real.  He starts off as a cliche' depressed teenager. He claims to be a loner, but I just don't feel he's anything more than another hot young face being dragged across the latest magazine covers to sucker us into thinking he's important.  We spend little time getting to know Claire Daines, and feel nothing for her.The new Terminatrix is played by some apparent model who does a fairly good job by simply pretending to be Robert Patrick from the second installment. The only difference in her performance from Patrick is the special effects that are done with her.  She comes with a flamethrower, a magic internet key spike, and a lack of ability to mimic other people.  Personally, I think the T-1000 (Patrick) was a much better villain.  He could slip through small cracks and holes to get to his enemy, and couldn't get stuck to a magnet.The whole Skynet headquarters, or whatever you want to call it, looks like a cheap rejected set from Stargate SG-1, as well as the characters and their wardrobe.  Nothing about these people are believable, so again, we feel nothing.In some scenes (Endoskeletons in battle, Arnold missing half his flesh, and Terminatrix losing her metal skin on a magnet) the CGI effects are top of the line.  They feel real.  However the scenes involving the CG Hovercrafts and nuclear explosion of central LA look incredibly fake. You can see the individual circular CG puffs that make up the mushroom cloud. The chrome surfacing on the Hovercrafts look like something from The Lawnmower Man. They look completely untangible, and I don't feel the suspense of their presence. I could see how hard they were trying to convince us that it was real by having a harsh brushed-metal surface, while the previous practical counterparts were just a simple soft polish.  You only should use CG where you have no choice.  In this case, they believe erasing a few strings from a hovering model isn't as effective to them as replacing the entire thing with unfinished-looking CGI. Also, I'm not in suspense when I'm supposed to fear being crushed by noticeably CG vehicles.The worst problem with T3 in my opinion is the cinematography.  It's not horrible DP work, but it doesn't have that ""we're involved in the action"" feel that the second film had.  This felt like we were spectators, rather than players.  The lighting didn't feel suspensful.  The editing had little rhythm.  The choices for camera angles were uninvolving.  It's like for each moment of the story, they had to spin a roulette wheel of storyboard angles for the same shot, and whatever the needle landed on, that was the camera angle they chose.Since the script is the heart of a production, I give it more credit than I normally would.  6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
better than expected,"i was expecting a average movie since cameron was not directing the movie. but the movie wasn't a disappointment. its a good movie, the ending is very good. i found myself in the mood halfway through the movie, 'the fear of machines' brought about by the other two movies. it gets real interesting after that. the director has brought some humour which works, but unecessary. i would love to see a T4. Now the bad aspects. Loken does not fit the TX profile that well, she looks beautiful but a girl more athletic and more importantly a bit muscular would have been the better choice. Stahl is also not a very ideal choice either. he is short and has a softer image. i don't know why Edward Furlong from T2 was not chosen. the continuity had a very strong impact on the appeal of John Connor. Otherwise a taller guy with chiselled features resembling the John Connor from T1. The movie was shot mostly in daylight, T2 was shot in the night giving that somber and lonely feeling putting a fear in the hearts of audience. It should have been followed here.

(Which is more than I can say for the Matrix 2 and 3)I think the best change from the last movie to this one is the recasting of John Connor. Nick Stahl did a pretty good job, and it was a hell of a lot better than Edward ""I'm Strung Out On Everything In Existence"" Furlong could ever do.

I have always liked this installment.,"I appreciate this sequel even more after watching the last three Terminator sequels which were all awful and forgettable, especially Dark Fate. I wasn't expecting much from Terminator 3 since most sequels go downhill fast and the second sequel usually scrapes the bottom of the barrel but the chase scene near the beginning was a truly bracing experience that made me sit up and take notice.I liked the fact that the Terminator was a female in this one. I have always liked seeing woman in action flicks doing things that we are used to seeing men do. Also, having a female Terminator followed the logic of Terminator 2 where subsequent Terminators were more streamlined and elegant and yet more powerful than the big and bulky Terminator of the first movie.I am probably one of the few people, if not the only one, who likes T3 more than T2. I appreciate that in T3 the Terminator's mimicking abilities were not taken to the almost comical extent that they were in T2 where in one scene the T1000 liquefied and morphed into a black and white checkerboard floor. That was a bit much for me. I also liked that they began to flesh out the story to explain how the machines ended up taking over. In all, I think this was the LAST decent Terminator movie.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Good to great action, but has issues","The huge car chase scene probably makes this movie, with everything else paling in comparison.  The sheer scale of the destruction is amazing.  I haven't enjoyed a chase this much since Pierce Brosnan took that tank for a joyride in Goldeneye.My main complaint is that with the change from Edward Furlong to Nick Stahl, John Connor went from being a whiny snot to a brooding snot, but remained a snot nonetheless.  If Nick Stahl's John Connor tried to give me an order, I'd push him down and stand on his head.If they do a T4, let's see John Connor be a bit more heroic, a bit more confident and in charge of himself.  In T2, Connor was a marshmallow.  In T3, they added a graham cracker's worth of hardness.  But to lead like his character eventually must, you need to be a sword, not a s'more.And let's forget the comparisons to Michael Biehn I've been seeing in the user comments here.

Inferior continuation to the Terminator saga lacks excitement,"In this second sequel set ten years after the events of Terminator 2: Judgement Day when John Connor and his mother Sarah Connor seemingly stopped the occurrence of the war between war between mankind and Skynet, John Connor (played by Nick Stahl) is 19 years old and is living as the drifter with no place to live, paranoid about being found by another terminator. However, Skynet sends T-X (played by Kristanna Loken), a powerful and sinister android who's bent on killing Connor. Aided by his future wife Kate Brewster (played by Claire Danes) and CSM-101 (played by Arnold Schwartznegger), another terminator resembling T-800, John Connor must find Kate Brewster's father General Robert Brewster (played by David Andrews) who is capable of shutting down Skynet as it spreads a deadly virus across the globe that would lead to nuclear war and ignite the war between humans and the machines. Racing against the clock, will John Connor succeed and save the future of mankind, or does mankind have a dark future ahead of them?The first two films were quite impressive, the first film dealt with the Terminator traveling back in time to assassinate Sarah Connor and her then-unborn son John Connor to prevent the war, and the second film followed the next terminator traveling back in time to protect John Connor from being killed by T-1000 as he was supposed to be the future resistance leader in the war against the machines. This film, directed by Jonathan Mostow, continues the story of the franchise, while this demonstrating some pulse-pounding action sequences and a compelling premise, it sadly falls short of the excitement that made the first two films entertaining. This movie continues the story on a rather middling note. From the first ten minutes, we are introduced to the evil robot T-X driving around town and executing these targeted civilians who serve no relevance to the plot. Then we are introduced to CSM-101 who arrives at a strip bar to steal the clothes and car keys of a bouncer, similar to what we saw in Terminator 2 with T-800. There is also the intense, but exciting special effects-heavy car chase scene with CSM-101, similar to the motorcycle chase with John Connor and T-1000. These two scenes, while full of excitement, play a great homage to the events of the last films to where it almost feels it is repeating the same events from the previous movie. From there on, the plot becomes less and less interesting, the action becomes less compelling, and the characters seem a bit tiresome. The main thing the characters are lacking is good dialogue and writing. Thus, they end up becoming less memorable. While the actions manages to keep the film standing, this film itself suffers in many places, especially the ending which I found rather anticlimactic, even though it sets the tone for the next film.Terminator 3: Rise of The Machines did not live up to my expectations and fell inferior to the last two films, especially the second one which I consider the best of the franchise. I believe this could have been better if it was handled by James Cameron who was responsible of the last two movies.",5.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Lame,"Terminator 3 was a disappointing movie.  I expected more but left feeling unsatisfied.A few things:1) Apparently high-ability, super-intelligent machines growl and meow when they are upset.2) Apparently physics does not exist in the future... The Toyota truck would have not been able to move after a rear collision with another car.  The collision were very CG animated... Too CG animated... Just flat out unbelievable.3) I enjoyed the stock footage of when the Terminators' battery pack ""became unstable"". I thought that was hilarious that the director used old stock footage from mine explosions (the second battery pack - at the Crystal place).4) What was with the gay dancer? Stupid subplot.  Obviously the director wanted to add humor from past Terminator movies for nostalgic reasons but failed.  In fact, the humor behind the whole movie was banal.5) It is obvious that Arnold is older than 50.  Geriatrics is fun!6/10.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Too much of the first sequel; Cameron's absence is a miss,"After Terminator 2: Judgment Day or T2 known to fans introduced computer generated imagery (CGI) effects to scare the living daylights out of people along with bringing character development, great chase sequences, a wicked villain (Robert Patrick as the T-1000), high octane action sequences and making Arnold's character The Terminator a new hero to everybody. And that was all thanks to James Cameron.In 2003, Jonathan Moss (U-571) brings back the hero from the dead along with bringing a new plot to the film. The film still involves John Conner (Nick Stahl) grown up after witnessing the events where he could've been killed by the T-1000. He's a homeless person living on the street where his only survival is his strength and eating off medicine at a local stray pound. His mother Sarah Conner (Linda Hamilton) is dead so the kid's got nobody else left.Now comes the villain in the movie. In the first movie Arnold played The Terminator going after Linda Hamilton and preventing her from having a son who would be the hero in the future; in T2 the villain was T-1000 killing anybody related to John Conner. Now the villain is not a man but a woman who goes by the name of T-X where her mission is to go after future military workers; she kills teenagers left and right from drive-thru restaurants to parties where her main target is Kate Brewster (Claire Danes) the daughter of a military general. Once Kate and John find out what's going on, they go out in hiding before The Terminator catches them and becomes their guardian.T3: Rise of the Machines is okay fun. The action sequences were the only reason to see this movie, but it feels empty without James Cameron directing the third installment of the series where in each of the movies he directed, something new is always introduced. It's just too much of a repeat to follow.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Mixed Bag,"I went into T3 not knowing what to expect.  I came away not knowing what to think.The movie is entertaining, let that be said.  The action never lets up except maybe at the end, where it could have used more punch.  In contrast to some reviews I actually liked the storyline, it just felt like it could have gone on a little longer.Arnold is as charismatic as ever, even with the low amount of dialogue.  I was a bit disappointed the lengths the filmmakers went to poke fun at T-800. I wished he could have been a bit closer to the meaner Terminator from the first movie in contrast to the ""softer"" one from T2.  There are many laughs in the film and this is welcome.  The first movie was more of a B horror flick and T2 more sci-fi.  T3 falls somewhere in between the previous two in nearly all areas.The special effects were very good.  The final iteration Arnold goes through in the end is magnificent.  I wished it could have lasted longer.With the Matrix Reloaded we had a film that was simply too much.  It also had a story that was so convoluted I really gave up on caring what happens to the characters.  T3 is the opposite in nearly all areas.  It needed more of everything except a few less corny lines.In the end I am now wishing for T4 and an all out battle.  I hope it comes because like the previous two movies, T3 leaves the audience hanging wondering what is going to happen.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Saved by the Story.  James Cameron, where are you?","T3 suffers from the ""Matrix Syndrome,"" the need to outdue and surpass its predecessors with bigger, bolder, more blast-worthy action.  Chases and nitroglycerine abound in this film as characterization is pushed to the background.To be fair, very little characterization is needed except for the Claire Danes character.  Unless you've been living in an isolated commune for the past 20 years, you know the Terminator.  Arnold's persona has become pop culture myth -- like the Six Million Dollar Man writ large.  Stahl's character, John Connor, is still the ordinary man tormented by his awesome destiny.T3 does deliver the stunts, the explosions, even the catchy one-liners to which we've become accustomed.  Arnold's performance is stellar.  His charm breathes humanity into an automaton (Gov. Schwarzenegger one day perhaps?). Stahl is competent, while Danes is immeasurably underused.  Note her role as Juliet in Baz Luhrman's Romeo and Juliet -- but hey, this isn't Henry James. Kristanna Loken is good as well, sexily exuding VERY homicidal tendencies.Yet beyond the action, T3 main point of interest is the story.  While the first 2 films touch upon existentialism and self-determination (""There's no fate but what you make"" is a recurring theme), this film does a 180 and focuses on destiny.  The ending is intriguing, a little 12 Monkeys-que, and certainly depressing.I agree with Roger Ebert in saying that T3 is really a dumbed down version of its history.  Were it not for the creative ending, I probably wouldn't have been as impressed.  That said, T3 is a worthy addition to the franchise.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
