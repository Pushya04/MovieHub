Another Gary Oldman Triumph,"It's a one man show about one of the towering figures of the 20th Century and what a show it is. Gary Oldman has been able to be Sid Vicious in ""Sid And Nancy"" with the same outstanding commitment and extraordinary results. Joe Wright, the gifted director of ""Atonement"" presents us with an irresistible version of Churchill through the magic powers of Oldman but sometimes he doesn't seem to trust the power of what he has in his hand. Eccentric cuts in the middle of a famous speech for instance and other stylistic distractions arrive with irritating frequency but that doesn't spoil. too much, the joy and fun of seeing Gary Olman in action. Also interesting to notice, Dunkirk provides a very moving moment for the second time this year.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Oldman Shines,"Although its been shown to have been largely fictionalized, the gist of the story is accurate. Oldman gives an incredible performance, and not as some old bellowing windbag either.
After seeing this, one might recommend reading churchill's own 6 volume set on the subject, but to save time, the first volume, The Gathering Storm, may provide one with some historical pretext for this monumental event in western history-Churchill standing up to a madman, and this saving not just britain, but all good men everywhere.
Oldman, you da man!",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Almost history,"As a film this is quite good; it's not dull, the performances are good, the production design is excellent, the script is a professional piece of work and even Oldman's make-up is not too distracting.However, something is not right. If most people get their history from movies, this is concerning. It's obvious that actual events occurred with real people and what they did and said but in a movie this gets pasteurized into what smart people believe will be more thrilling, more sympathetic, more emotional. That process necessarily alters things into something that is even anachronistically rendered and therefore not in the record.This defect occurs frequently in this movie , so it's not history but myth making. A good example is Churchill's dive into the Underground to meet the common person to steel his resolve. Now Churchill had a mixed view of the average voter, and he was a patrician, but even that aside, he did not need to take a Tube train survey to gauge opinion.This scene is poached from Shakespeare's Henry V where the king goes among his soldiers the night before battle to hear them and take courage from their strength. Steal from the best is a good policy, but it's not history. It's Shakespearean history and that trades effect for accuracy too.The audience is given this scene to present Churchill as an instrument of democracy; he's acting for what the people want, therefore he's doing the right thing. It's called pandering.Well, it is just a movie.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Gary Oldman at his best!,"Darkest Hour shines a light on a crucial moment in British and world history - the initial month of Churchill's term as he stand resolutely in the face of Hitler's advance while his peers wish to sue for peace.The standout in this film really is Gary Oldman, who is as deserving of an Oscar for this performance as any actor ever has been. He toed the line perfectly, giving a powerful and accurate portrayal of Churchill without it every feeling like a gimmick or impression. He quite simply was Churchill. The physical transformation was a part of this, and the costume and makeup departments should be extraordinarily proud of what they achieved, but the majority of the credit goes to Oldman himself. The task at hand for was not an easy one. Churchill's speeches that he tackled perhaps go down as some of the finest in the English language, being so recognisable and quotable, and he delivered them flawlessly. Simply tremendous from Gary Oldman.What I also thoroughly enjoyed about Darkest Hour was its attention to detail in bringing to life the period. The costumes, sets, score and supporting cast all blended together perfectly to recreate May 1940 so finely. With this alongside Oldman's performance you will get completely lost in this film and the era, perfectly capturing the spirit of the British people at the time. This was demonstrated particularly well during a spectacular scene on the underground, which was a real highlight for the film.The camera work in Darkest Hour also stands out as we navigate the murky and claustrophobic tunnels of the Cabinet War Rooms, which adds to the sense of the British having their backs against the wall, trapped by the Germans.If you love history, fine acting, and accomplished cinema, look no further than Darkest Hour.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Well worth seeing just to watch Oldman's performance.,"At this point, ""Darkest Hour"" has an overall rating of 5.3. I do not understand this at all, but the film has not actually been released yet and has only been seen in film festivals. I assume the overall score will increase considerably--especially since the two reviews for it were quite positive.Now I must point out that I am a retired history teacher and I consider Winston Churchill to be perhaps the greatest politician of the century. So, I clearly have a bias and predisposition towards liking the movie...especially if it's done well. Is it a crowd pleaser? Maybe not, as the average movie-goer (especially teens) might not enjoy this or care a lick about the film.The story covers only a portion of the month of May, 1940...just before the fall of France during WWII. Prime Minster Chamberlain is about to be tossed out of office, as his appeasement strategy with Hitler has turned out to be completely stupid. In his place, some hope for Churchill to be the next Prime Minister...though some forces are working to depose him as soon as he comes to power. At the same time, the war is going as badly as it possibly can. Can Churchill survive this? Well, of course...duh, it's HISTORY!The reasons to see this are two big ones....the film has achieved the look of 1940 beautifully and Gary Oldman provides an Oscar- winning performance in the lead. If he is not at least nominated for this top award, I will be completely shocked...and he really managed (along with ample prosthetics) to LOOK and SOUND like the great man. Great job all around...and a perfect film.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Outstanding even with some minor flaws,"I cannot remember the last time I was in a movie and I said, gee I wish this movie would keep going because it's just so damn good. I don't really have to say anything more about Oldman beyond what's already been said, that was brilliant Academy Award work. Despite being a literalist on history and not enjoying Hollywood embellishments/contrivances that didn't really happen, I will repeat something I said on another movie (Patton): I am okay where a fictional event is one that could have happened (or maybe happened out of time sequence) where it is used more to show the persona of the character than to establish an historical fact. Notwithstanding this, the subway scene may have been a little much. Strong cast throughout, including the portrayers of King George VI, Chamberlain, Halifax and Churchill's lovely secretary (James). A must see for WW II buffs and appreciators of good cinema everywhere.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Riveting production despite its pat view of history,"We go to the movies to be gripped by powerful narratives presented with good scripts and moving imagery. This film has all of it, most especially a riveting performance by Gary Oldman.The subject matter will clearly divide audiences thanks to its pat view of history: UK as the righteous hero and everyone else as inept -- Italians and French losers, Germans the evil fascists, US completely unmentioned, Canada the quiet prairie for monarchs to escape to -- in the still-somewhat- mysterious Dunkirk incident where Hitler could easily have tightened the noose and pushed UK over the edge of what was evidently a crushing defeat, but somehow allowed them the leeway to escape by civilian boats. There's next to no mention of the French army that stood its ground and valiantly sacrificed itself to win a couple of days for the Brits on the beach.All that said, as a film, this is a gripping narrative with just the kind of insouciant wit you'd expect from Churchill. While movies such as ""The Gathering Storm"" with Albert Finney were more considered, Darkest Hour is the kind of production that wows awards juries and audiences. Worthy watch when it comes to a theater near you. I feel Nolan's ""Dunkirk"" would be richer if you saw it *after* Darkest Hour.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
"A superb film, Churchill's story brilliantly told.","Churchill takes over a failing Government as Germany rages war on Europe.It's a fascinating piece of history, there are countless films about world war two, but this focuses on the story from Churchill's point of view, how he came to power, and the obstacles he had in his way.An incredible production, the visuals are staggering, I remember being blown away at the cinema, years later it's still as impressive.It's a powerhouse performance from Gary Oldman, I believe he studied Churchill for quite some time, he is captivating from start to end here, he's always immensely watchable, here though, even by his standards, this was dazzling, the mannerisms, the eyes, the irascibility, it's perfect.Kristin Scott Thomas, Lily James and Samuel West are all terrific in their respective roles, the acting throughout is first rate, plenty of well known faces for you to recognise.It's one of those films I never get bored of watching.A classic, 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
I never tire of watching this!,"This biopic of a very narrow period in Winston Churchill's life - May 1940 to be exact - was probably made to earn British actor Gary Oldman the academy award, but man, did he ever earn it! This film won Oscars for Best Actor for Oldman and for makeup, and I'd say they definitely earned that. Great trouble is taken to make sure you believe you are looking right at Sir Winston. Oldman literally disappears into the part.The film opens with Parliament in open rebellion over Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain's failure to deal with Hitler and the opposition party demanding his resignation. Chamberlain wants Halifax to replace him, another appeasement advocate cut from the same cloth as he, but Halifax refuses saying his ""time has not yet come"". So Winston's party picks him literally - while holding their noses - because nobody else wants the job. And for good reason. Hitler is knocking over European countries with the ease of dominoes and the entire British army is trapped at Dunkirk, with so many damaged ships blocking the harbor that no other ship can get into it to rescue them.Next we meet Oldman's portrayal of Sir Winston. He is a man of enormous appetites - food, drink, cigars - and sometimes tremendous temper. His spending brings him to the brink of bankruptcy multiple times. His party doesn't like him. The king resents him for how he advised his brother when he was planning to marry Wallis Simpson. And Chamberlain and Halifax STILL want to appease Hitler and because Churchill does not, they are working to undermine him, particularly with the king.The film uses two obvious plot devices that are probably not based in fact. One is Churchill's young secretary who at first he scares to death with his tantrums, but later the two become close as he softens his approach with her . The other is a trip into a subway to get ""the man on the street's opinion"" about Hitler that just seems eye-rollingly over the top. There is a baby that the mother oddly says looks like Churchill, what seems like an interracial couple in 1940, and a woman who, from the way she is dressed, appears to be a socialist. Yet they to a man, to a woman, to a child, encourage Churchill to fight Hitler to the end. This fictitious event seems to be stolen from Shakespeare, but if you must steal, then steal from the best.Honorable mention has to go to Kristen Scott Thomas as Clementine, Winston's supportive wife who is often overlooked by history. Also deserving mention is Ben Mendelsohn as King George VI, who is portraying a man much more comfortable as monarch than he was portrayed in Then King's Speech, but then this is not his story.Yes, it is not historically accurate, but if Churchill did confront the situations and people he confronted in this film, he probably would have acted exactly as he was portrayed here.I knock off one star for not at least TRYING to explain to the audience WHY - with Hitler obviously not trustworthy - members of Parliament would not realize the choice was between slavery and war. The answer is that WWI cost Britain a generation of young men. Literally every British young man who went to war either died or was maimed. And in the end the entire conflict seemed like it had been for nothing. And so many of the British - and more of the Americans - did not want to go through this a second time with the exact same country, not realizing until it was almost too late that the Kaiser was no Hitler.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
I feel cheated,"I really enjoyed the movie and am a big Oldman fan. But got sad and even angry when I read about how every event that cought your attention is not true. Never took place. Pure fiction. Like the train ride, or the verbal battles about peace negotiations, or who initiated Operation Dynamo, or peoples reactions to his speeches.I can accept when movie makers make 5 things happen in one day that actually took place on different days or merge 5 peripheral persons into one, as they so often do, to give it better momentum. But to take liberties with historical facts, the ones that make the foundation of the movie. Stop doing that... It should be illegal.And for those in a bad mood now: Check out ""Young Winston"" from 1972. AFAIK depicts truth well, and at least I was surprised to know about his youth.",2.0,Anonymous,Biography
Wonderfully refreshing look at Churchill,"I'm sure I am not alone in having seen everything ever filmed about the man.But this is nothing like I have seen before. He is so funny.We see his ability to make jokes like never before and there is more here than just dry sarcastic references.He keeps us in stitches. He must have told 25 jokes.This film starts in the days when Chamberlain knows he cannot continue as prime minister, alongside the crippling uncertainty of his cabinet meetings, and through to when the entire country, as a result of his speeches, stands firmly behind Churchill as war leader.What surprised me the most was how large a role the opposition party played in Churchill's rise to power.Excellent supporting cast from those distinguished actors we have seen in many BBC productions and ""Game of Thrones"".Ben Mendelsohn's portrayal of King George VI was stunningly well done.A real delight at Tiff - too bad no Q&A for my screening.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

"Historically fascinating, but most importantly filled with exhilarating energy, humour and passion throughout","Not only is this a riveting account of one of the most important moments of the Second World War, but it's also an exhilarating drama that goes beyond being a simple biography by bringing humour, energy and passion to every moment. With a stunning central performance by Gary Oldman, confident and passionate directing from Joe Wright, and a brilliant screenplay from start to finish, Darkest Hour is a simply exceptional film.When telling a story as well-known as that of Winston Churchill and the Second World War, being both exciting and historically accurate isn't always easy, but that's where the unique take on the historical drama of Darkest Hour comes in.Yes, it does tell of the extreme intensity of the early days of the war, the political manoeuvring in Westminster as Churchill was appointed Prime Minister, and the very real and impending threat that the fall of Britain could very well mean the end of freedom-loving Western civilisation, which are all absolutely fascinating to watch unfold, but they're all parts of history that you arguably already know very well.That's why the film's decision to bring a brilliant sense of humour and a strong passion to proceedings is so effective. The importance of the events being portrayed on screen is never downplayed, and there are indeed some very intense and emotionally powerful moments, but there's so much more to Darkest Hour than just history, something that made it such a refreshing watch compared to how most Oscar-bait biographies turn out.Above all, what impressed me most about the film was the fact that it's just so funny. It's by no means a comedy, but this isn't a pompous and dry historical drama, but one that takes glee in pointing out the eccentricities in its main character, eccentricities which are undoubtedly a part of why Churchill is so lauded and respected to this day.While the film praises Churchill's bulldog spirit in fighting the fight against the Nazis, it's always keen to show him in a slightly brighter light, almost as if he was a man who stumbled into the most important job in history by coincidence. In that, there are so many genuinely hilarious scenes as Churchill's quirky personality clashes with the more uptight politicians of Westminster, a part of the film that I felt not only made everything more entertaining, but helped to give the movie an incredibly refreshing energy, allowing me to see Churchill in a very relatable, personal light rather than just as a historical figure from a textbook.As well as being downright hilarious at points, there's a real passion behind the film's depiction of the darkest hours of the war. With Churchill being forced over to opening peace talks with Hitler, the film does an incredible job at inspiring you to a point of fever pitch, fully backing Churchill's bulldog spirit to fight and defend freedom to the very last moment, meaning that the internal conflict he suffers throughout the film is such a riveting focal point.This is an undoubtedly patriotic film, and heaps a lot of praise onto Churchill's gusto, but that doesn't mean it's overly jingoistic. There may be a case that Brits watching the film will feel more emotion from its incredible passion, but I still feel that most of that comes from how well the character of Churchill is developed throughout, from a bumbling, mumbling, lovable old man to a truly honest and principled leader.Finally, we have to talk about Gary Oldman's performance, which is amazing. For one, thanks of course in part to the make-up and costume teams, it's pretty impossible to tell that you're watching Gary Oldman in this movie. But not only does he look nothing like Oldman, and so much more like Churchill, but everything about Oldman's performance, from the smallest details about Churchill to his fantastic passion and energy on screen, pulls you further and further into the moment, and creates an exceptionally convincing portrayal of the great man and the situation surrounding him, which I was blown away by.Overall, I absolutely loved Darkest Hour. It's an undoubtedly riveting historical drama about a crucial turning point in global history, but more than that, it's full of incredible energy from start to finish, with amazing and still appropriate humour throughout combined with stunning patriotic passion, making for a genuinely exciting and properly entertaining film that does so much more than your typical Oscar-bait fare.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Well Acted but Historically Contrived,"Winston Churchill is one of history's most enigmatic figures. As Great Britain watches Europe fall to the Nazis, most of the leaders sit, hands in their pockets, trying to figure out what to do. Neville Chamberlain has sold the country out, thinking he has become buddies with Hitler. Of course, the scourge of history would simply see that as avoiding an obstruction. So the call on gnarly old Winston, whose reputation in other confrontations is not that good (according to this film). So we are going to see a biographical presentation of this great man. What we get is a guy that can't go twenty minutes without downing four fingers of whiskey or smoking a dozen cigars a day. He is doddering and forgetful. That's OK. Maybe that was him. I suspect not quite as severe. While this movie portrays the time pretty accurately, they repeatedly stick him in situations where he can deliver pithy comments. A secretary, the young woman who portrayed Rose on Downton Abby, is his confidante. There is a scene on the subway. Did any of this ever take place. I know it is historical ""fiction,"" but we deserve a bit more. It's not a terrible movie, hence my rating, but don't write a book report using the events presented here.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

There are several historical happenings well developed and well paced , but especiallty focusing on May 1940 when Neville Chamberlain is forced to resign due to the opposition Labour Party that accused being too weak in face the Nazi enemy , in fact he signed the useless Covenant of Munich in 1938 , then Churchill is appointed P.M. , along the way he manages to convince the different parlamentary forces , as well as he prepares Dynamo operation to rescue the European armies in Dunkirk .The cast is frankly excellent as Gary Oldman giving an awesome acting who won deservedly Academy Award , Stephen Dillane as the coward Halifax , Ronald Pickup as the failed negotiator Chamberlain , Ben Mendelshon as the skeptical King George VI , Dame Kristin Scott Thomas as his beloved wife and Lily James as his personal secretary, and other secondaries in brief appearances as Samuel West , David Schofield , David Bamber , Nicholas Jones , and David Strathairn diving voice to President Franklyn D Roosevelt .

Interesting but only mildly engaging,"Not as engaging as I'd hoped. I enjoyed The King's Speech more when it comes to understanding the humanity of a leader (or figurehead in the King's Speech). This is obviously a darker piece dealing with WWII and Oldman is great, but at times it felt like it was from a distance. Female characters could have used more development too.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Oldman's great; pity about the film.,"When Meryl Streep won her third Oscar for playing Margaret Thatcher in ""The Iron Lady"" it was as much for her make-up as it was for her acting, (it's actually one of her least interesting performances; more mimicry than anything else). The same can't be said of Gary Oldman's turn as Winston Churchill in Joe Wright's ""Darkest Hour"". It's a phenomenal performance that demolishes all previous Churchills. Yes, he looks the part thanks again to his hugely talented make-up artists and he has the voice off pat, but more importantly he gets inside Churchill's heart and head which is, perhaps, something of a surprise considering the material he's been given to work with is really rather third-rate.Wright's film, which simply covers the month of May 1940 when Churchill was elected Prime Minister and saw the evacuation at Dunkirk has every cliche in the book including a disasterous scene when Winston decides to ride the Underground for the first time in order to gauge public opinion. This sequence is positively embarrasing though Oldman just about manages to carry it off. Elsewhere the film is very unevenly acted. The men have the best of it with both Ben Mendelsohn and Ronald Pickup impressing as the King and Neville Chamberlin respectively. On the other hand, Kristin Scott Thomas isn't given enough to do as a rather genteel Clemmie and Lily James makes for a very dull secretary. So then, very much a hit and miss affair worth seeing for Oldman's Oscar-winning performance, (they may as well put his name on it now), providing you are prepared for another lame history movie and Wright's poorest picture to date.",5.0,Anonymous,Biography
"""This is a film about resistance.""","At the Paris Theater premiere in NYC last night, Joe Wright concluded his introduction by saying, ""This is a film about resistance."" That brought immediate and enthusiastic response from the crowd. Oldman gives a stunning performance, but the entire ensemble is clearly caught up in the relevance of the work, not a false note anywhere. Powerful film celebrating Churchill as in touch with the resilience and grit of working class commoners. The villains here are the snobbish pacifist appeasers. Hard to say what American audiences will make of this. It could go either way. There's enough populist ammunition here to leave a huge chunk of the American political landscape as devastated as the castle in Calais.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Oldman's Triumph,"Garry Oldman first came to my notice as Sid. He now steps into Albert Finney's gigantic shoes, and does not disappoint. But a note of disapproval- it was not the Labour Party which brought down Chamberlain in 1940, it was Leo Amery, single handed, with the greatest, most passionate Cri de Coeur ever heard in a parliament until the Man himself unleashed the 18"" guns of the English Language.
 P.S. I should have mentioned Sir Roger Keyes turning up to the debate in Full Dress. A bit of Drang for Amery's Sturm. But it was Chamberlain's own party that delivered the Coup de Gras: Greenwood just sank the boot into the corpse.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

Some Good Aspects Do Not Make Up For A Collection Of Lies And Half-Truths,"Myths don't have to be factually truthful; that's the whole point. At their best, myths take us to truths that are deeper than mere facts. At their worst, they sell us lies about ourselves; and lies are shifting sands to build a foundation on. In defence of myths, people will do the outrageous and the marvellous; and those who question myths often find themselves shouted down or, at the worst, dead.So to The Darkest Hour, Joe Wright's account of the short period of Churchill's premiership at the outset, through to Dunkirk (when, not coincidentally, the Brexit referendum was reaching fever pitch). Made around the same time as Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk, it's a very different film. Largely conventional, not without merit, but in many senses lazy and deceptive.Let's be clear. Gary Oldman is remarkable in the lead role; worthily recognised in awards, as with the remarkable prosthetic and make-up work that enabled him to be physically transformed. Kristin Scott Thomas as his wife is criminally underused, but still turns in a lovely performance, as she so often does. It's also moves along at a brisk and engaging pace, and is never dull despite the well-won paths of this slice of history.But it stops there. The film buys in to the Churchillian myth from the beginning - the divinely appointed (no, I'm not exaggerating; I've heard that said many a time) strong leader who led Britian, standing alone, to heroic victory. Churchill is often bathed in almost god-like light, especially when speaking in Parliament; his alcoholic drinking habits are largely passed off as eccentric indulgences; his near-bullying treatment of his secretary is mostly played for gentle laughs (especially empahsised by the none-too-subtle score). This is a Churchill who mostly brooks no dissenting voices despite appointing opposition politicians to his War Cabinet; who mocks the King behind his back (with whom he becomes friends at the convenient moment). Many shots are framed and lit as if they were historical portraits. It's all about the myth.The myth of British exceptionalism, which will like Churchill himself, remain unchallenged. There is no hint of irony when Churchill says that countries that fight on, rise strong; Britain spiralled in to decline for decades after the 2nd World War. At one point, a telegram sent by Churchill to an officer in the field is portrayed as worryingly close to the voice of God; and we all know you can't talk back to God (spoiler: you can, actually; but I hope I've read too much into that scene).As decision time to surrender or fight on approaches, Churchill takes a ride on the London Underground to gauge the will of the people. This never happened; but that's not necessarily a problem. Shakespeare makes it work, after all. But not here; it becomes an absurd process of Churchill asking blindingly obvious leading questions to a convenient cross-section of British society (in the space of one train stop), and everyone looks very happy and confident. Churchill then stretches the truth of that encounter to breaking point both with his own Cabinet and the House of Commons, in a moment of falsehood that would be enough for a vote of no confidence if any of it actually happened.And thus the Churchillian myth, embraced by Johnson and Trump alike, is bolstered one again; his racism not mentioned, his choices and character uncritiqued. Not to deny his great wartime achievement, of course; but this story needs better. For from this myth of Churchill summoning innate British independence and strength comes nationalistic isolationism, airbrushing of prejudice, and the excusing of anything as long as the ends serve the greater good (read: support the myth).It's not a bad film; it's decently entertaining and passed an afternoon in Covid Lockdown. It is, however, a film in service of a grandiose lie. And over-praised in service of lies can dangerous in times of crisis.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Fantastic Performance,"It is impressive how The World War II can still produce great films after almost eighty year. ""Darkest Hour"" is an example, showing the biography of Winston Churchill in 1940 when Hitler was invading and dominating the Western Europe. But the film works mainly because of the fantastic performance of Gary Oldman. It is amazing how this actor incorporates the image we have of the great British leader in archival footages. Gary Oldman really deserves the Oscar! Kristin Scott Thomas is also impressive in the role of Churchill's beloved wife Clemmie.

Don't expect a history lesson,"While watching this film, I was glued to the screen. Everything from the opening title screen showing Hitler and his army, Gary Oldman's acting, the speeches, the costumes and setting... were all superb! But then after the film ends, there will be something in your brain that tells you to do some fact checking. There is one scene in particular which I guarantee that you will look up and be extremely disappointed that it never happened. Then after checking that fact, you will soon realize there are many other historical facts that were portrayed wrong in the film.I had given this film a 9/10 until I did further research. I definitely don't regret watching it, but I was hoping for a more accurate portrayal since this is a ""Biography"" after all. If anything, this film will get you interested into reading more about Winston Churchill once you realize how inaccurate it is. The only reason to watch this film is for Gary Oldman's acting and the wonderful costume designs/setting.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
A historical travesty,"This film covers a period of real tension and drama. So why does the film have to invent fiction to tell the story? Perhaps modern film making prioritizes a flowing narrative over the truth, but to misrepresent so many people telling the story accurately would have provided more than sufficient content staggers me.
Oldman plays his part as written well. Chamberlain and Halifax are quite unconvincing though and many of the scenes are so unrepresentative of what would have happened in the Britain of 1940 ruins the fictitious plot line. 
The number of historical inaccuracies are currently beyond counting, and many unecessary, for example Chamberlain was in pain in May 1940, but had yet to be diagnosed with cancer, and when he was he remained ignorant of the fact because his doctors elected not to tell him. Overall a huge let down.",4.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Far from film's darkest hour, and Oldman's finest hour","Have a real fondness for biopics, regardless of the treatment of history and their subjects for some. Consider Winston Churchill one of the most interesting and extraordinary 20th century, and history in general, figures and Gary Oldman one of the best actors working today that in recent years deserved more roles more worthy of his talents. The rest of the cast are also talented and while Joe Wright is hit and miss for me a few of his films are good to outstanding.'Darkest Hour' was to me a very good film (the best of Joe Wright's films post-'Hanna'), and there is much more to it than the ""Oscar bait"" that a lot of films and performances getting multiple award attention get untruly and unfairly dismissed and what 'Darkest Hour' is likely to be dismissed as in the future. There is also much more to it than the universally acclaimed, and more than deservedly so, lead performance. Sure, its approach to history is dodgy to say the least (true of quite a number of biopics), but as a film on its own there are a lot of great qualities.By all means 'Darkest Hour' is not perfect. The effects do look fake and personally really do wish that the female roles were as strongly written as the male ones. The male characters have a lot of meat to them, while Lily James especially has a role that's underwritten and almost thankless.There are a couple of instances where the narrative isn't so strong. The phone conversation with Churchill and Roosevelt does contradict and distort Roosevelt himself and the relationship between the two. More problematic was the much criticised London-tube scene, feels like it goes on forever and takes the meaning of farcical too far.Gary Oldman, nearly unrecognisable, is just extraordinary as Churchill and, although he is one of the best, most underrated and most versatile actors today with many great performances under his belt, this is his finest hour, a performance not just deserving of multiple awards but it is one deserving of an award sweep if it's not too late to be considered for an Oscar nomination (if so, he's been completely robbed). He makes Churchill a compellingly real figure, one that has struggles with his fame and power and not just a powerful figure important for his decisions, and not an impersonation or caricature.The rest of the cast support him beautifully, Kristin Scott Thomas is affectingly elegant and stately, and her chemistry with Oldman is suitably tender. Ben Mendelssohn and Ronald Pickup (as a more conflicted Chamberlain as usually painted) are particularly good of the male support. Despite her charm, James doesn't have enough to her role to shine properly.Visually, 'Darkest Hour' looks great. The period detail is both beautiful and atmospheric, the detail gotten spot on. The photography is inventive and striking. Wright's direction is not subtle (pretty bullish actually), Wright has never been known for subtlety, but it is a confident, playful and passionate directing job, with some emphasis on seriousness but not overly-so, some of his best since 'Atonement'. The music is stirring but at other times lyrically soothing and suitably sombre on occasions.Furthermore, 'Darkest Hour' is thoughtfully and confidently scripted, while there are playful elements the darker and murkier side is emphasised more. Churchill's speeches have the inspiring power that they should do and the historical events that should wrench the gut do so but in a relatively restrained way. The story is compelling, what could have been stuffy and dull is actually lively and with a dark bullish and bold approach that still takes it seriously. It is very familiar and there is not much new to what we already know, but the approach 'Darkest Hour' takes is very much different to what one expects.Overall, very good film with a few drawbacks but also an extraordinary performance from Oldman. 8/10 Bethany Cox",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Oldman is a BEAST!!,"I'm not an acting expert or a movie buff. I even hate England for its imperial values and for invading my country but damn it I'd go to war for Gary Oldman's Churchill!! That much I knowI watched this movie today on an air flight, returning home from a hectic work week I needed a time burner or something to ease me to a good sleep. Damn was I surprisingly mind blown!!Mr Oldman is an acting beast! I'd say he was working all his life preparing for that role, ramping up from spitting in JoeyTribbiani's face to spitting in the House of Lords, way to go Sir, way to go! I mean this is the Winston Churchill I know, I'd say even better!! I watched many impersonate the British bulldog but never like this, some had his accent right, his walk, his figure but Mr Oldman gave us a glimpse to his soul and for that Sir, I'll say I'm grateful. Thank youUpdate: I just found out he won an Oscar for it. Well deserved Sir, well deserved.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Gary Oldman is Electrifying as Churchill!,"That Gary Oldman is one the greatest living actors in the planet is a known fact to all cine-buffs around the world, but with 'Darkest Hour', Oldman has put himself in a place of the all-time heavyweights in Acting. As Winston Churchill, Oldman is a veritable delight & shows us what an actor can do when he sinks his teeth into the part. Oldman is PURE, unfiltered Acting Greatness. And Yes, the movie is good too!'Darkest Hour' follows Winston Churchill (Oldman), and follows his early days as Prime Minister while Hitler closes in on Britain during World War II.Writer Anthony McCarten & Director Joe Wright deliver 'Darkest Hour' with great success. While its ambitious to a fault (the film particularly lags in its initial reels), its overall a great story of a leader, who's over-the-top & risky decisions led him to create history of its own. This is a personal story about a man in great power & how his courage & at times, humor, led him to become a leader to follow. Churchill is not a perfect man, he's always in need for a drink or smoking up a cigar with less regard to polluting a room, but he's a determind man with a vision of a true Prime Minister, that knew how to deal with the forces when the world was at War. McCarten's Screenplay is engrossing & despite some flaws for its initial tepid start, make up for a well-written Screenplay. Wright's Direction is commanding & powerful. Bruno Delbonnel's Cinematography & Valerio Bonelli's Editing are fantastic. Art & Costume Design, as well as Make-Up, deserve a special mention. Dario Marianelli's Score, also, is good.But the reason to really watch 'Darkest Hour' is, of course, Gary Oldman. With his perfect body-language, to his impeccable dialogue delivery to the fierceness in his eyes, Oldman is truly remarkable. This has to be his finest performance ever after his mesmerizing turn in 'Tinker, Tailor, Solider, Spy'. With Golden-Globe & SAG Nominations already in, Oscar Calling is meant to happen.Of the rest of the cast, Kristin Scott Thomas, Ben Mendelsohn & Lily James, are in top-form.On the whole, 'Darkest Hour' is a Gary Oldman showcase. And it helps that the showcase is also a pretty good period piece. Watch It.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Great subject; hackneyed treatment,"Joe Wright's ""Darkest Hour"" poses a problem for me. The subject is interesting and important, but the film, following Winston Churchill's early days as Prime Minister of Britain during World War II, never rises above the average. Worse: one could also say that -- in the fictitious sequence, about 2/3rds of the way through, when Churchill rides the tube to talk person-to-person with average British citizens riding the train -- it comes to life precisely at the same moment it sinks into cliché, and credulity is strained past the breaking point. Ultimately, Oldman playing Churchill is the only thing that makes this movie experience worthwhile. (But Joe Wright has seen better days -- especially in his 2007 masterpiece, ""Atonement"", the extraordinary film that incidentally introduced 12-year-old Saoirse Ronan to the world.) Not much better than a BBC-TV movie of the week.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography

"Dull, Drab & Dour, 'Darkest Hour' Is Nothing More Than An Oscar Bait","What could have been a captivating insight into the psyche of one of 20th century's most iconic, important & influential figures is reduced to an exceptionally dull, drab & dreary biopic that's crafted with zero passion, narrated with no flair, and remains a monotonous ride throughout its runtime.

V for virtuoso,"THE DARKEST HOUR: France has fallen, the Nazi invasion of Britain is eminent, the bulk of the British forces is stranded on the beaches of Dunkirk with no way out, current PM, Chamberlain, is considered too weak to lead and rather than entering a war members of Parliament feel they cannot win, they vote to negotiate a peace settlement with Germany, with Italy acting as a mediator. After Chamberlain's ouster, Winston Churchill is appointed the new PM, and backed by the voice of the people, vows to never surrender. He firmly believes negotiation equals capitulation. I don't know how historically accurate the rest of the movie is (except for some of his speeches, I imagine), or if some of the conversations depicted ever took place, but they reveal a stunning picture of the temperament, power, character, oratory skill and will of Churchill to never accept defeat. Gary Oldman, as Churchill, brings all of that and more to his riveting portrayal - the voice, the mannerisms, the walk, the tilt of his head. His months of research and preparation have paid off. Oldman just may be the greatest, and most under appreciated actor of his generation. (The male equivalent of Streep, to my mind.) This is his movie and any superlative you can think of applies to his performance. There is no question as to his Oscar nomination for best actor, just as there is no question of Joe Wright's nom for direction. Wright has chosen some unusual, innovative and interesting camera placements - in particular, the shot of James as she types, taken from underneath the typewriter shooting through the keyboard up to her face. I mean how creative is that? Wright maintains the tension and immediacy of the situation, yet manages to throw in some moments of tenderness and humor - a really masterful job. Also no question as to the noms for best picture, the brilliant screenplay, cinematography, costume and makeup design. I would pay to see the process of transforming Oldman into Churchill. Kristin Scott Thomas has been getting the accolades for her performance as Churchill's wife, Clementine, but the real supporting nom should go to Lily James' beautifully sublime performance, as Winston's secretary. Score: 9.5. GO!",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Worth watching for Gary Oldman,"I understand that this is a movie but it is still based on a very well known and important moment in world history so when certain characters are portrayed in a more likable or witty way it just doesn't feel quite right. You just end up wanting to watch a proper documentary of the real thing. That said, there are elements of this movie I think that are very good and also open to criticism, but it's still a worth a watch just for Gary Oldman's amazing performance.We follow Winston Churchill and his decision making process leading up to the war against Hitler's Germany.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
A complete butchering of history - a great dissapointment,"For a film that is supposed to be based on a true story, this film represents a complete butchering of history for it is - at many points - factually and historically incorrect. Every inch was covered with falsehoods. All the official papers, minutes and biographies from those who worked with him at that time make clear that at no point did he consider entering into peace talks, even if the BEF at Dunkirk was destroyed he was determined that the country should fight on. He did not ride the tube asking the public for their opinions on continuing the fight; he did take the argument to continue the struggle to the Cabinet after pressure from Halifax and Chamberlain to enter talks with Hitler and received great support. It was not a gathering of MPs in Parliament. Oldman and the film failed miserably to catch the power and oratory of Winston's wartime speeches, please listen to the originals. Operation Dynamo was not conceived at the last minute as portrayed. There is not much in the film that is factually correct and there is too much to write about the inaccuracies in my review. All those who worked with Winston Churchill including those from the military always spoke of his great energy, presence, incredible workrate and ability to fit 2 days worth of work into a single day, they knew they were working with a political and oratorical goliath in history. None of this was portrayed or came across in the film.Bottom line is it is a shame that many of those who watch this movie will come away thinking this was what Churchill was like and this was how history unfolded, which could not be further from the truth. Take it all with a fistful of salt. The film diminshes the man and his record in saving Britain and most likely the world from Nazi domination.Equally, the Director and Producers have presented Winston Churchill - the greatest Briton of all time - as a bumbling, mumbling, indecisive, drunkard and in the process have sullied his name and done the great man a terrible disservice. The greates Briton of all time willbe spinning in his grave as I am after watching this trash. How dare they....",3.0,Anonymous,Biography
"""We shall never surrender""","Last year the film Dunkirk told the story of Great Britain's most anxious moments
from the point of view of various British soldiers, sailors, and civilians helping to
get the British Expeditionary Force off the beaches to fight another day. Had these people not done their job on those beaches Winston Churchill's moments 
here would either have never happened or would have been an empty gesture
of defiance. No doubt had the Wehrmacht successfully invaded and occupied
the United KIngdom, Winston Churchill would have been shot post haste by
the Nazi occupiers.But because the job was done at Dunkirk Winston Churchill got to do his. After the Nazi invasions of Denmark and Norway, Neville Chamberlain's wartime government was ready to go, but the only Tory that the Labour Party
would serve under was Winston Churchill who had been consigned to the
back benches for most of the 30s. Labour itself was tinged with pacifism early
on and Churchill was the one who had consistently warned of the danger's
Hitler's rearmed Germany posed.Nevertheless events made it a 'close run thing' as another British prime minister of another century described a crisis he faced. In Churchill's cabinet
were a number of potential appeasers and their choice for prime minister was
Chamberlain's former Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax played by Stephen Dillane. If the members of that cabinet had their way Halifax would have been
prime minister and would have sought a negotiated peace.Gary Oldman has Churchill down perfect with all the bulldog defiance that comes through in those old WW2 era newsreels I well remember. No one else
in Great Britain would have pursued the policies he did at that time. He gave
the British people the blood, toil, tears, and sweat he promised and Great Britain and its Commonwealth partners carried on alone until the following
year Hitler attacked the Soviet Union and the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor.
Oldman got a well deserved Best Actor Oscar.Best scene in the film is when the aristocratic Churchill goes into the London
Underground for a sampling of public opinion. Even with the memories of
the stalemate in the trenches of WW1 still in their memories as they are in the
various Cabinet members like Lord Halifax they don't want to give up.The next chapter of the saga is contained in the all star epic The Battle Of 
Britain which tells of the Royal Air Force beating back the German Luftwaffe
while the bombs rained on British cities.That's not to be missed either.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
A movie on the politics of II World War on the British side,"I loved the camera movements (dolly and slow motion trucks), cinematography is beautiful, and special effects are used in the right way. Gary Oldman's performance in the hard tile of Winston Churchill is perfect. There are some very good dialogs (the one between Churchill and Franklin D. Roosevelt is possibly the best), but, despite I did like the fantasy moment in the underground/subway, his chat with black Marcus Peter is perhaps exaggeratedly unreal. The mood and dynamics inside House of Commons is a cinematic delight for all people interested in party politics. Churchill's relationships with his wife, his secretary and king George are also interesting. A good movie worth watching.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

Even though this movie didn't keep me at the edge of my seat it was still far from being boring. My favorite thing about this movie is Churchill, the person who played his character did very well.

Darkest Hour,"A tour de force from Gary Oldman as he portrays Winston Churchill in his first few months of office at the start of WWII. Oddly enough though, aside from a few brief appearances from Kristin Scott-Thomas, the rest of the cast in this historical biopic are really quite unremarkable. The speeches are delivered magnificently; but there are too many speculative machinations going on - not least those involving King George VI - that do bring the credibility of this into question. There was plenty of accurately documented reportage from this time to enable Anthony McCarten to pen an entertaining script based more on the facts of this unsteady period of Churchill's premiership; Dunkirk; his relationship with Halifax & Roosevelt etc. Rather than invent storylines. The attention to detail is superb and Oldman well deserved his second Oscar.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

A story of the stuffiness of politics and the strategy of.,"I always find accounts like this interesting. A window into past events that otherwise we wouldn't see. That said, although this is wonderfully acted, masterfully visualised, is it a touch over stylised, much in the way that the BBC would handle any period drama. There are undeniable moments of cinematic power, but I'm sure it over simplifies things. Much has been made of the train scene for one and yes it's a bit sappy, needless and completely out of step with the rest of the film. There's a great deal of humour and even whimsy, a story of the stuffiness of politics and the strategy of, rather than the war itself and overall it's style is it's own undoing. Although Oldman predictably is the centrepiece, it's Kristen Scott Thomas that excels for me, she's fantastic and even Stephen Dillane as the villain of the piece Halifax is exceptional (he's great in The Tunnel TV series too), but it does all feel like a 90 plus minute build up to that speech and although it is rousing when it arrives, it's too little too late... for the film, thankfully not for actual events.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Very Disappointing,"I expected so much more from this film but was totally disappointed. I didn't expect a documentary and any film has to enjoy some literary license but this is a work of sickly perfumed fiction which completely misrepresents the man to the point of unrecognizability. If the film is a portrayal of a man, then it is certainly not Churchill.Churchill has to be understood in the light of his heritage and class. If a peripheral player initially, he was born into the ruling class. Like many only begrudgingly accepted into its ranks, he was therefore one of its strongest proponents. He believed he was born to rule just as much as commoners were born to die in the service of empire. The class system meant that he would never, ever have confided in someone he regarded as a commoner and the notion of him even addressing a black man is ludicrous. He was a committed racist firmly believing it to be the natural order of things. This is the man who, as a boy, simply wrote ""Marlborough"" on his entrance exam to Harrow believing this was enough to gain entry. It was.Churchill was well known for summoning servants and government employees to action while he was toileting or in the bath. This was not because he was accessible, charismatic or comfortable with his body as portrayed in the film. Rather this was a man who simply didn't simply care what they thought because he was Churchill and they weren't.The film quotes Churchill as supporting the marriage of Edward VIII to Wallis Simpson. In actuality Churchill was a pivotal character in opposing the marriage of Edward VIII to Wallis Simpson. Not because she was a divorcee and he was morally outraged (Churchill's father died of syphilis after a lifetime of philandering and his mother used sex as a social tool) but because he knew Edward would resign over it and he vehemently opposed Edwards desire to be an involved monarch. Simpson was widely believed to be having an affair with Von Ribbentrop (Hitlers foreign minister) and Churchill knew Hitler would use this to his benefit against a weak and easily influenced king. Churchill would never have been familiar with George VI and probably privately despised him as a weak and unprepared monarch. The royal family and many of their closest allies were closet supporters of Hitler believing him to be far preferable to the Communists who were a substantially more concrete threat. Churchill was utterly loyal to the throne and monarchy but George VI was only the current incumbent just as Edward VIII before him, had been.The film portrays Halifax and Chamberlain as weak appeasers when in actuality their fears were the loss of a complete generation of men like that experienced in WWI. Horror was embedded deep within many politicians who had seen/survived active service during WWI and were desperate to not revisit that period. Chamberlain is recorded as believing Hitler would most likely break his word but knew he had no choice but to try and gain time for rearmament despite the cost to his own career and legacy.It might not be a convenient truth but, successful evacuation of the troops at Dunkirk was solely because of 'Churchills' flotilla but probably because of Hitlers stated reluctance for a massacre. Hitler did not feel the British were the natural enemy (that was the communists) and that a massacre would negate the possibility of a agreement.If Gary Oldham wanted to be Churchill, then he failed. Churchill was much more imposing, had a deeper voice with substantially more gravitas. Oldhams voice is thin and reedy and, at one point, he even adopts a regional accent. Churchill was a war monger, rude, inconsiderate, terribly ill mannered and selfish but would sacrifice himself in a second for the notion of service and empire. He was not your irascible but charming uncle as portrayed in this film.",1.0,Anonymous,Biography
Voice of Defiance,"Darkest Hour immerses viewers in one of Britain's most perilous moments, masterfully portraying the political and moral crucible faced by newly appointed Prime Minister Winston Churchill. Directed by Joe Wright, the film delves into the intense backdrop of World War II as Churchill confronts a Parliament fractured by fear and dissent, especially with Dunkirk and Calais on the brink of collapse under Hitler's siege. The story captures Churchill's struggle not only with the external forces threatening Britain but also with the skeptical voices within his own government. Here, the man deemed erratic and mercurial, known for his ceaseless drinking and volatile temperament, must prove himself as a resolute leader with an iron will.Gary Oldman delivers an astonishingly transformative performance as Churchill, embodying his quirks, ferocity, and resilience with unrivaled authenticity. His portrayal of Churchill unveils the Prime Minister's rare brand of leadership, marked by an indomitable spirit and an extraordinary gift for rhetoric that could rouse even the most despondent. In a climactic moment, he powerfully delivers the line, ""He mobilized the English language and sent it into battle."" symbolizing how Churchill's words became his greatest weapon, stirring both Parliament and the nation to resist surrender.The film's cinematography and atmospheric score further elevate its intensity, while its historical fidelity brings the era to life with harrowing realism. Although Darkest Hour leans into a reverent portrayal of Churchill, often romanticizing his journey, it's this blend of myth and human vulnerability that makes the film so compelling. For anyone drawn to the intricacies of history or captivated by powerhouse performances, Darkest Hour is essential viewing, with Gary Oldman's riveting portrayal making it an unforgettable cinematic experience.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Oldman is Churchill,"7.7 stars.This is the story of Churchill when he was elected and then thrust right into a no-win situation near the beginning of World War II. He had to face impossible odds, but he did not give up or back down. He ordered England to never surrender. He was inspired by his people, and his people were inspired by him.What a wonderful experience watching this film. Oldman is a genius, and suffice it to say this was his best performance ever. This speaks volumes, considering all of his performances are great. Do you agree this was his best? It's his first Oscar so far, but he is great and will probably get another. He was really good in the 90's, but don't forget him as Commissioner Gordon (undeniably the best Gordon ever).What is fresh on my mind from just finishing this about 20 minutes ago, is that I shed a few hearty tears. His speech and conversation on the subway, his speech in Parliament, his poise, everything. Arguably the last ten minutes of 'Darkest Hour' was the best ten minutes of cinema in the past decade.Indeed it was the darkest hour ever faced by England. If you've seen the movie 'Dunkirk', you'll understand that the nation of England was an inch away from utter defeat, and this was but one instance that changed the whole war. Had they lost their army that day, wir würden auf Deutsch sprechen (we'd be speaking in German).",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
A narrow zoom into Churchill's psyche,"A good movie, but one must narrow their scope. This is not a WWII movie or even a British war effort movie. This is a movie about Westminster and 10 Downing St. In May 1940.This movie is about Churchill's doubt. Churchill who condemned Hitler is now being asked to negotiate peace with this butcher, monster, and worst of all, housepainter. Problems are that it doesn't show how he convinces people. The King just suddenly started supporting Churchill because he ""struck fear in the heart of Hitler""? It's telling, not showing. Chamberlain comes to support Churchill, but why?

Churchill's Defining Moment,"Darkest Hour, directed by Joe Wright, powerfully captures the sights and sounds of Winston Churchill as he rises to political power and unites Britain in the anti-Nazi cause during 25 intense days, from May 9 to June 4, 1940. This historical drama is beautifully crafted, with Gary Oldman delivering a phenomenal performance as Churchill. The film excels in its direction, screenplay, score, and cinematography.Rather than focusing solely on visceral moments, Darkest Hour engages viewers on an intellectual level, emphasizing the profound impact of Churchill's leadership during a pivotal moment in history. The narrative unfolds like a tense thriller, depicting Churchill being driven into decisive action by the looming threat of Hitler's aggression.Churchill's unique and unyielding intuition is at the film's core, suggesting that without his bold decisions, the world as we know it today might look vastly different. Darkest Hour celebrates Churchill not only for inspiring resilience and patriotism in his people but for his vigorous defense of freedom and democracy, showing that this was indeed Britain's most decisive hour.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Good account of a great leader in Churchill,"Good historical film. Oldman was good. Some of the most interesting scenes in the film are those where Churchill is dictating his speeches to a typist, a fictional character named Miss Layton. Unknown to Churchill through most of the film, the secretary has lost her brother, who died while on the retreat to Dunkirk. It was Churchill's defiance of Hitler and his stand against the members of his war cabinet (especially Viscount Halifax and the disgraced Neville Chamberlain) that resulted in the successful evacuation of nearly 300,000 troops from Dunkirk. Churchill eloquently said that ""success is not final, failure is not fatal. It is the courage to control that counts."" Britain was truly alone in the dark days of 1940. Czechoslovakia, Poland, Denmark, and Norway had fallen to Hitler. Soon, Belgium and France would capitulate. No help was forthcoming from America. Churchill recognizes that England had to take control of her own destiny. When Churchill was appointed Prime Minister, he had a string of failures to his credit in the disastrous Gallipoli campaign of World War I, the paternalistic policy on India, his contrary stance on the Russian Civil War, the gold standard, the support of Edward VIII in his marriage to Wallis Simpson, and the Norway adventure. He was essentially cashiered as a politician and in the ""wilderness"" throughout the 1930s. Yet, in May,1940, Churchill took center stage while admitting that he had ""nothing to offer but blood, toil, tears, and sweat.""",6.0,Anonymous,Biography

The Spectacular Gary Oldman,"I have nothing but admiration for Gary Oldman's masterful performance as Winston Churchill in 2017's Darkest Hour. He was unrecognizable through the prosthetics, and completely disappears into the character, as he conveys force in Joe Wright's staged intense discourses, and showcases warmth in episodes where Churchill is humanized. It is then unfortunate, that Wright's screenplay bogs down the stellar acting prowess, through out of place, artificial moments that screams Hollywood drama. For instance, Churchill's focus group discussion during his commute was an off-putting embellishment, that disengages its audience from its supposed climactic final act. Also, Lily James' character and her scenes seemed cinematic add ons for the sake of unneeded weepy drama.Overall, Darkest Hour is survived by Gary Oldman's Oscar winning performance; a feat that brings the character that is Winston Churchill to life, even when Wright's narrative crashes down. If only his camerawork and script shared the same level of flair, this picture could've transcended being good enough.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
any shortcomings are redeemed by top-notch acting,"In May of 1940, the Wehrmacht continues to encroach across Western Europe causing British Parliament to lose faith in the leadership of Neville Chamberlain. The search for a successor begins, but the only candidate opposing parties will accept is the cantankerous, hard-drinking, cigar smoking Winston Churchill--a polarizing individual who's without principle and insufferable to some (including his wife Clemmie), but also a tough, uncompromising leader to others. Tensions mount amongst government officials as they try to resolve the conflict at Dunkirk. Director Wright plunges viewers right into the heart of old English politics with crucial decision-making, volatile character interactions, and an imminent threat of annihilation, but without a doubt the real highlight is an electrifying Oldman who embodies the many shades of Churchill, from surly and stubborn, to doubtful and ultimately good-hearted. The anticlimactic finale is a bit of a letdown, but the acting alone is more than enough to make it worth the viewing experience. ***",,Anonymous,Biography
A pile of old tosh,"I've grudgingly allotted four stars for three of the leading performances. Gary Oldman certainly pulls out all the stops to deliver a performance that is convincing, colourful and entirely unsurprising. Yet he's also acted off the screen by Ben Mendelsohn every time Winston meets King George, for Mendelsohn gives a performance that is more under-stated, more human and less obviously manipulative. Oldman is also out-charisma'd whenever Kristin Scott Thomas glides into view as Clemmie. So for all its earnest Oscar-worthiness, Oldman's performance isn't even the best in the film. Acting aside, there is almost nothing to recommend Darkest Hour. It's burdened with clumsy plot exposition that sounds precisely like it's been cut and pasted from a history book. It's undercut by cheap, unconvincing special effects. And, most remarkably of all - even if you've somehow been sucked in by the amateur dramatics - it has one spectacularly ill-judged scene that instantly sinks the entire enterprise. You won't have any trouble spotting which scene I mean. You'll probably be laughing out loud or reaching for something to hurl at the screen. It's when poor anguished Winston takes the advice of the King and determines to ask the British people what to do. So he heads for the London Underground and - travelling just one stop east on the District Line! - chats with a cross-section of plucky Brits who all urge him to fight on. It couldn't be more ridiculous if one said ""fight them on the beaches"", the next said ""fight them on the landing fields"" , and the next ""fight them in the fields"". It actually couldn't be more ridiculous if they all then simultaneously broke into a song titled ""We Shall Never Surrender"" and Winston danced merrily with a couple of pearly kings and queens. It's a scene so mind-bogglingly awful that any respect you might have had for the film drains completely away and you spend the rest of the running time pondering just how something so awful was ever contemplated, much less actually staged and shot.",4.0,Anonymous,Biography
Gud 2017 movie,"Incredible screenplay, visionary directing, outrageous acting, and riveting sound!The inspiration, as per the screenwriter Anthony McCarten came from 4 speeches given by Churchill over the course of several weeks by Churchill, which makes up the period of the movie. The film exercises restraint in its emotive aesthetic choices - which coupled with the sound by Dario Marianelli- provide the supporting cloth for the actors' and actresses' visceral performances. The result is a portrayal which is honest, heartfelt, and magical.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
a dark time in history,"Passionate, rousing film about the dark days of May 1940, when Winston Churchill (Gary Oldman) became prime minister and resisted the idea of peace negotiations with Germany.I suppose hindsight is 20/20 but honestly - Hitler takes Czechoslovakia, Poland, Denmark, Norway, The Netherlands, Luxembourg, Belgium , and was on his way to France, who had no defense planned (how many Frenchmen does it take to defend Paris from attack - answer, no one knows, it's never happened), and there were people in Parliament that thought Hitler would negotiate a peace treaty.After taking over from Neville Chamberlain, Churchill finds himself alone in wanting England to defend itself. His speeches rally the people, and in the end, England fights.Now, it's never good to get your history from the movies. Films take dramatic license, combine characters, events, and telescope time to make a compelling story.There are a few things here that are fictional, the biggest one being Churchill going into the subway. That should have been cut.Also, history tells us that although in the film, Churchill agrees to at least listen to a proposed peace agreement - in reality, he never considered it and never agreed to it.Chamberlain is depicted saying he is dying of cancer; Chamberlain never told anyone he had cancer because he was never told that himself.The portrait of Churchill certainly matches what has been read and said about him. As everyone knows, Gary Oldman was magnificent. The rest of the cast did well, but it was Oldman's show.The most impressive thing to me about this film was the director (Joe Wright's) ability to capture the tension, the pressure, and the fright of what Britain was facing - alone - since the U. S. wouldn't do anything.For FDR it was all about Russia, and in the end, we see that Russia was handed eastern Europe. The forces against Churchill are depicted as overwhelming - one historian suggests that there probably weren't the loud shouting matches as depicted, but certainly a great deal of discussion.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Darkest Hour - Not the Finest Hour,"When I was in middle school one of my favorite guilty pleasures was a film called Small Soldiers (1998). In it, the late Phil Hartman sits in his living room, enjoying his new satellite TV while watching a WWII documentary. Tanks thundering, bombs bursting, Hartman looks up from his barcalounger and makes the comment, ""You know, I think WWII was my favorite war."" For some reason while watching Darkest Hour, I thought a little about that brief cutaway in that one mediocre kids' film. It sounds silly but with that in my mind, I thought more about our constant media exposure to the subject and how even today a lot of the stories we tell (and still the majority of our war stories) are about WWII. Seems not since the second Punic Wars has there been another moment in history where people lineup slack-jawed and stargazing at big men, doing big things. Heroes, villains, world-shaking stakes and potentially world ending weaponry, these are the things we remember.And arguably the biggest hero we remember of that time was Winston Churchill; the vigorous wartime British Prime Minister who, in the words of a visiting American reporter, ""was the right man in the right job at the right time."" Yet Darkest Hour has the man intermittently questioning his own resolve. Set between May 10, 1940 and June 4, 1940 the Churchill (Oldman) who stands with heavy prospects and even heavier makeup is one who just saw his worst fears become reality and is now unsure of what to do next. A great man? The film seems to be suggesting not yet.Now, lest you believe this film is a war drama in the truest sense of the word, know that much of the plot hinges on Churchill's precarious political position and the machinations of his dysfunctional basement war room. Viscount Halifax (Dillane), former Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain (Pickup), the generals and even the King (Mendelsohn) himself all seem to be pulling at different threads to see what unravels out of the pugnacious statesman. They don't know what to make of the cigar smoking, brandy swilling neophyte, which complicates an already dire situation on the European mainland.Despite the makeup and prosthetics, Gary Oldman turns in a stellar performance as Churchill. While so much of the film wallows in the character's uncertainty, the flame of defiance is ever present in the veteran actor's eyes. You also have to admire the man's dedication to the role. He walks like Churchill, jokes like Churchill, chomps on cigars like Churchill and at times he mumbles incomprehensively like Churchill - which brings me to the biggest problem with Darkest Hour.The film has a very inconsistent approach to history. Oldman no doubt studied the role as if it were the acting challenge of a lifetime; which is great if one were to compare footage of Oldman and Churchill reading the ""We shall fight them on the beaches"" speech side by side. But as a function of storytelling the accuracy of Churchill's speech patterns comes at the expense of communicating information. This becomes especially distracting when Oldman is throwing taunts and tirades at Lily James and Kristin Scott Thomas while sounding like a broken muffler. It also doesn't help that depending on the light he either looks like a Bob from Office Space (1999) or a Muppet.On the other side of things, nearly everything meant to heighten the tension (except, you know, the war) is either fictional or highly suspect. I'm not an expert historian by any means but even I know Churchill's war room couldn't have been that duplicitous and aggressively petty. Much ado is made about the new Prime Minister's defiant stance against Hitler, which I'm sure wasn't as resolute as we all think but certainly not as wishy-washy as this movie make it become. There's also a scene on the London tube that has the double problem of being historically false and incredibly trite.But even if you're not a student of history and are just looking for a good yarn – even then, Darkest Hour falters. Director Joe Wright's consistent approach towards his films is one of close angular shots, studious symmetry and a flare for the frontloaded metaphor. It works in Atonement (2007) and Hanna (2011) but not here.Here it feels more like they were making a made-for-TV movie in all honesty.This is a very small film; so small that it's trying to fit into the mind of a single man. Yet that single man is a towering figure in a crucial moment in history we're already incredibly familiar with. Churchill deserves a Patton (1970) not a Hyde Park on Hudson (2012); a movie that greets the greatness of the man on equal footing instead of trying to reel him in like a whale on a rusty fishing trawler. Given Gary Oldman's performance, Darkest Hour could have been something special. Instead it's just the third film released this year centered on the evacuation of Dunkirk. As far as smaller movies go, watch Their Finest (2016) instead.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
One of the great lead performances of recent years,"While the film itself gets a bit bogged down in places, Gary Oldman produces a truly mesmerising performance and is well worth his Oscar.This is one of the best characterisations I can remember seeing and while much of the film is a bit forgettable, Oldman makes it a wholly enjoyable experience. The excellent supporting cast of Kristin Scott Thomas, Lily James and Ben Mendelsohn also shine in fairly demanding roles.The now infamous train scene is faintly hilarious but, set against the overall dourness of the story and setting, was actually quite welcome in my eyes. Then again I enjoyed the John Lennon scene in Yesterday so what do I know?",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Better if taken as an actors showcase.,"Gary Oldman finally picked up a (most deserved) Best Actor Oscar for his sterling work here. Acting under makeup and prosthetics, Oldman delivers the goods as the legendary 20th century politician Winston Churchill, a man who certainly had a gift for orating. As the film begins, it's the ""darkest hour"" of WWII, and hopes are severely diminished against the ferocious onslaught of Hitlers' military forces. The public has decided that current Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain (Ronald Pickup) is not cutting the mustard any more, and makes it clear that they want change. Churchill is offered his job, and learns that by accepting it, he will have to accept that people have little faith in him. He will have to earn their trust.Ultimately, the film is better seen as a showcase for its wonderful cast than as a story. It ends just when it's getting interesting, and it would have been nice to have seen more of an assessment of Churchills' overall achievements. As it is, it often focuses on Churchills' confrontations with indignant associates, who think that there are already strikes against him in his past history. Yet, we do get some sense of the heavy weight that this man bore, as he took every setback and all casualties to British forces to heart.Assisted by his makeup team (who also brought home Oscars), Oldman is able to completely disappear into this role. You won't recognize the actor, but you'll be struck by his ability to engage the viewer, and get them involved in the story. The supporting cast is equally strong: Ben Mendelsohn as King George VI, Lily James as Churchills' sometimes overwhelmed typist Elizabeth Layton, Stephen Dillane as Viscount Halifax, Samuel West as Sir Anthony Eden, David Schofield as Clement Atlee, etc. However, Kristin Scott Thomas gets precious little to do over the two hour five minute run time, as Churchills' devoted wife Clemmie.In the end, this is typical filmmaking, in which events are either dramatized or fictionalized entirely, which once again just goes to show you that with movies, you sometimes just have to take them with a grain of salt. Not that I know many people who really expect an accurate depiction of history with this sort of thing.Seven out of 10.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

a human portrait,"It's the early days of WWII. The Germans are on the march and the Allies are retreating. Winston Churchill (Gary Oldman) is not yet Prime Minister but is in line for the job. Clemmie (Kristin Scott Thomas) is his long-suffering supportive wife. Elizabeth Layton (Lily James) is his new secretary. He faces uncertainty from King George VI (Ben Mendelsohn) and dying Neville Chamberlain (Ronald Pickup) while Viscount Halifax (Stephen Dillane ) pushes for peace negotiations.This is a compelling historical character-study drama. The most intriguing aspect is that it depicts Churchill as a man slowly overwhelmed by the failing campaign and even considers a peace with Hitler. In many ways, it is a more human portrait and a much more dramatic character study. Historical accuracy is a little questionable especially the subway ride. I understand the premise but it feels manufactured. I don't know if there was ever such a note with all those regular people names and that speech to rally his supporters. If such an event happened, I would think he goes into the subway with his mind already set. He wouldn't need these regular folks to give him his direction. The climatic change in him is the meeting with the King. While I understand the idea that the normal people give him the strength to make the iconic speech, it feels fake. It's small bump in an otherwise beautiful, epic, thrilling road.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
bla...bla...bla.......and no real action,"If u think u will see a film world war 2 action war film then u are mistaken.
 this film is more about the talents of gary performing the English prime-minister rather than a real film about war.
 there is no action...no war.......just gary trying to keep interest up.
 it's a film about the will of survive of a nation even when the end seems near.
 the film has value it's not bad at all and if u like gary u will love it but it's not a real world war film as it showed nothing that happened and how it happened in the war.
 to get a clue this was more like the d day film which was more about strategy and plan rather than pure action.
 gary is great he may get the Oscar but the film is so and so nothing special.
 there are a lot better films about hitler and the war with real action and suspense scenes.

Gary Oldman delivers the goods,"When I was listening to Rush Limbaugh a couple of weeks ago, he ranted about this movie. He stated that you could not take your eyes away from the screen. Let me tell you, he was right! From the opening scene of the British Parliment when that one guy was screaming about how much he hated Neville Chamberlain, I was hooked. There was not a lot of action in this movie, but more of a focus on Winston's mannerisms, humour, temper and overall demeanor. There were some very touching scenes, such as when he took a moment to be with his wife when she fretted about their finances. A big part of this movie that some people will not have known, is that in 1940, England was considering ""surrendering"" to Hitler. Could you imagine? I hope that everybody goes to see this movie.

"""Not b*ggering it up""","As Doctor Who repeatedly points out, time is most definitely a tricksy thing. As I think I've commented on before, the events of 1940-45 are not in my lifetime but were sufficiently fresh to my parents that they were still actively talked about... so they still appear ""current"" to me. But I find it astonishing to realize that to a teen viewer this film is equivalent in timeframe to the sinking of the Titanic! #ancienthistory! So I suspect your connection to this film will be strongly affected by your age, and that was definitely reflected in the average age at my showing which must have been at least 60.It's 1940 and Western Europe is under siege. Neville Chamberlain (Ronald Pickup, ""The Second Best Exotic Marigold Hotel"") is the Conservative Prime Minister but is voted out of office in an attempt to form a grand coalition government with Labour leader Clement Atlee (David Schofield). Despite appearing a shoe-in for the role, Viscount Halifax (Stephen Dillane) turns it down, thinking that his alternative (and bête noire) would drink from the poisoned chalice and be quickly be out of his (and Chamberlain's) hair. For that alternative choice is the volatile and unpredictable Churchill (Gary Oldman), grudgingly invited into the job by King George VI (Ben Mendelsohn, ""Rogue One""). With the Nazi's bearing down on the 300,000 encircled troops at Dunkirk, and with calls from his war cabinet to capitulate and seek terms of settlement, this is indeed both Churchill's, and the country's, 'darkest hour'.Despite the woeful lack of historical knowledge among today's youngsters, most will be at least aware of the story of Dunkirk, with many having absorbed Christopher Nolan's film of last summer. This film is almost the matching bookend to that film, showing the terrifying behind-closed-door events that led up to that miracle. For it was terrifying seeing how close Britain came to the brink, and I'm not sure even I really appreciated that before. While this might have been a ""thriller"" if it had been a fictional story, we well know the outcome of the story: but even with this knowledge I still found the film to be extremely tense and claustrophobic as the net draws in around Churchill's firmly-held beliefs.Gary Oldman's performance is extraordinary, and his award nominations are well-deserved. We have grown so used to some of his more over-the-top Russian portrayals in films like ""Air Force One"" and last year's (pretty poor) ""The Hitman's Bodyguard"" that it is easy to forget what a nuanced and flexible actor he is. Ever since that ""No, surely not!"" moment of that first glimpse of the film's trailer, it has almost been impossible to 'see' Oldman behind the brilliant make-up of the character (Kazuhiro Tsuji gets a special credit for it). But his eyes are in there, and there are some extreme close-ups (for example, during a bizarre and tense phone call with Roosevelt (David Strathairn)) when you suddenly see ""There you are!"".While I have nothing against Brian Cox as an actor, I far prefer the portrayal of Churchill on show here compared to last year's ""Churchill"": true that that film was set three or four stressful years later, but Cox's Churchill was portrayed as an incompetent fool, an embarrassment to the establishment that have to work around him. Oldman's Churchill is irascible, unreasonable, but undeniably a leader and a great orator.Mirroring ""Churchill"" though, the action is seen through the eyes of Churchill's put-upon secretary, here played delightfully by Lily James (""Downton Abbey"", ""Baby Driver"") who perfectly looks and sounds the part. The character is more successful than that of Ella Purnell's Garrett in that she is given more room to develop her character and for the audience to warm to her. Oldman is getting all the kudos, but Lily James really deserves some for her touching and engaging performance here.Also in Oldman's shadow is the always marvelous Kristin Scott Thomas (""Four Weddings and a Funeral"", ""The English Patient"") as Clemmie Churchill, expressing all the love and frustration associated with being a long-suffering wife to an over-worked husband in the public service.At the pen is ""The Theory of Everything"" writer Anthony McCarten, and I'd like to say its a great script but with most of the best lines (""a sheep in sheep's clothing"" - LoL) coming from Winston himself it's difficult to tell. Some of the scenes can get a bit laborious and at 125 minutes - though not long by any means - the script could still perhaps have had a nip and tuck here and there.Where some of this time is well spent though is in some sedate shots of London street life, across two separate scenes panning across everyday folk as the stresses of war start to become more evident. This is just one of the areas where director Joe Wright (""Atonement"", ""Pride and Prejudice"") shows considerable panache, ably assisted by the cinematography of Bruno Delbonnel (""Inside Llewyn Davis""): a boy closes his telescope-fingers around Churchill's plane; a bomb's eye-view of the beleaguered Brigadier Nicholson in Calais; and - very impressively - the smoky imperiousness of the House of Commons set.And most-importantly Wright delivers what Christopher Nolan couldn't deliver in ""Dunkirk"": a properly CGI'd vista of hundred of small boats crossing the channel to Dunkirk. Now THAT is a scene that Kenneth Branagh could justly have looked in awe at!!!There are a number of scenes that require disbelief to be suspended though: the biggest one being a tube train ride - very moving and effective I must say - but one that features the longest journey between any two stations on the District Line than has ever been experienced!So this is a great film for really reliving a knife-edge moment in British history, and is highly recommended particularly for older viewers. If I'm honest though, between ""Darkest Hour"", ""Churchill"" and John Lithgow's excellent portrayal in ""The Crown"" I'm all over portrayals of the great man for a few years.

Light but heavy,"The central performance is really something. If you watch this you can see that Gary was a shoe-in for the Oscar. And that is not to put anyone else or rather their performances down. This is about a fantastic performance from a guy who always delivers and whose time it was to win the Golden Boy (aka Oscar).But Academy Awards aside and maybe some of the jokes too, this is very talk heavy. And I could hear some people sigh the longer it went on. So while I didn't feel this was or rather is too long, I can understand if some people may not have the patience to really watch something like this for so long. If you are aware of that and critisize the movie for this, you are doing the movie a disservice and other potential viewers might not feel that way.So while you can argue about the place in film history in general, you can't argue about the performances in this. The speeches could have gone wrong or backfired, but they didn't ... they actually made this really good. It's almost a shame quite a lot of it, is shown in the trailer",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
I was led to believe that Gary Oldman was in this movie and yet he's nowhere to be seen. What a scam.,"This was fine. It's a very theatrical movie with lots of yelling that can get annoying, but the performances are all good, especially of course the completely unrecognizable Gary Oldman (more like Gary Old Man am I right?). The makeup is mindblowing.It's unfocused and inconsistent in its style, but mostly makes up for it with a very strong third act, a delightful, though undoubtly fictional scene in a subway (let's just say the real Churchill would probably not have shaken hands with a black man) and Oldman's wonderful, though very hammy performance as Winston Churchill.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Brilliant portrayal of a brilliant man in a brilliant picture,"Gary Oldman has 88 acting credits on his IMDB page. Incredibly, this fine actor has only been nominated for an Oscar 1x - as Lead Actor in 2012's TINKER, TAILOR, SOLDIER, SPY. He did not win.This streak will end at this year's Academy Awards.Oldman's performance as Winston Churchill in Joe Wright's DARKEST HOUR is the kind of acting performance that comes around only once every few years. It is the right mix of actor, script, director and role combining all of these factors perfectly to bring you a portrayal of a character that is insightful and unforgettable.Based on a script by Anthony McCarten (THEORY OF EVERYTHING), DARKEST HOURS chronicles the events behind the scenes in England in May, 1940 - the time where Churchill was named Prime Minister and immediately had to deal with the rising Nazi threat as well as the fact that almost the entire British Army - 300,000 troops - are trapped on the coast of a place called Dunkirk.This behind-the-scenes drama is the perfect kind of film for Director Joe Wright (ATONEMENT, PRIDE & PREJUDICE) and he excels here. His eye for captivating pictures and scenarios sets just the right tone for this film, never going to hard (or too soft), focusing on the man at the center of the storm and the real human cost (both in troops and to Churchill himself) that unfold during the events depicted.But it is his work with the actors that Wright really shines. Besides Oldman, Lilly James, Kristen Scott-Thomas, Ben Mendelsohn and Stephen Dillane all give strong, refined performances understanding the tone of the film and their place in it. These are all strong supporting turns in a film with a hurricane at the center that could have easily blown these supporting players away. But it doesn't, thanks to Wright's direction of these fine supporting actors and (especially) Oldman's captivating and generous performance.I was pulled into this film from the start and was never pulled out. The spaces and the silence between words and gestures were filled with raw emotion (some will think it is slow and boring, but I couldn't disagree more). In this day of quick cuts and fast, CGI-Laden special effects, it is nice to watch a slower moving (but not slow moving) drama with interesting characters unfold before you to tell a real - and necessary - story.This film will garner quite a few deserved Oscar nominations this year, but there is one shoo-in.

A rather stodgy bit of history,"Darkest Hour makes me think of 2012's Lincoln, in that it appears aimed more at schoolchildren looking to learn history than in moviegoers looking to be moved and entertained.Gary Oldman is quite good as a Churchill. Rather than the sharp, sure, rather loud Churchill one often sees, Oldman offers a man torn between his beliefs and the possibility that he's about to make a horrible mistake.Apparently the movie does take some liberties with the historical facts, and unfortunately the movie seems to find it easier to make the false stuff, like a conspiracy to take Churchill down or an engaging subway ride, more entertaining than the real stuff.I'm torn between giving this a 6 and a 7. It's pretty decent, and Oldman is quite good, but it feels overall rather slight.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Not an accurate depiction of the man,"Although Oldman managed to accomplish some of Churchill's physical mannerisms, he failed miserably at mimicking his bravado. Churchill was at times an arrogant and egotistical man, brimming with self-confidence, Oldman portrayed him as a simpering fool, who questioned his every decision, and didn't have the spine to carry conviction in any of his decisions.It appears to me this is yet another feeble attempt, which seem so popular in todays entertainment industry, to lessen the impact created on the world by many of the great figures in history. There are those in todays media who wish to retell history in a light they believe is more favorable to their own political objectives. It is a disturbing trend, which should be met with disdain by the viewers of their fantastical imagined machinations. The best lies are those that are told with enough truth, that the gullible with swallow the lie in its entirety.",5.0,Anonymous,Biography
Attended a history class,"I was curious about how Churchill behaved during the tough war time, and how he got things done without necessary support.One observation which is useful to me. That's everyone will have fear at some moment. No matter he is a prime minister, or a king. Beyond the titles, they are ordinary human. They also need support from their loved ones, and the people surround them to conquer the fear, to gain the confidence.Another interesting thing I learned from the movie is that Churchill was elected as the prime minister not because he is the perfect one, but because he is the only option for his party. All the PMs/Presidents are the results of compromise among involved stakeholders.I also came to a more proper understanding about Chamberlain by this movie. In the history class, I didn't quite understand the word of ""appeasement"". Just simply thought that means Chamberlain was a traitor of his country. In this movie, I got another understanding about Chamberlain's appeasement policy. He just wanted to protect his country and people with the approach which seems making sense at that war time.The words of ""you can not reason with a Tiger when your head is in its mouth"" seems quite obvious, but why Chamberlain's appeasement policy got supported at the beginning?

Enough is enough,"Let's call every historical figure off the big screen or TV monitor, please. Why we have to watch these guys past again and again? Why the British and U.S. movie industries would repeatedly to praise or despise these guys again and again? Every of these guys' life stories in different angles, at different points of views were told again and again, facts and truth about these guys would have become more fictitious and away from their true selves.Let truth being told, without subtly lured America into the WWII in time, England, no matter how this guy gave so many 'Attaboy!', 'Let's hang-on', 'We'll not be defeated', 'We shall fight them in the air, on the sea, on the land...', all would be lost. Those words would be just like farts without any practical purpose. And every word spoke in this guy's bedroom or at the table with his wife could only be treated as fictitious made-up. Nobody really knew what this guy really did when he was alone or with his wife. Everything in this film, just like other films about this guy or those other historical figures were just fictionalized to fool the readers or the movie-goers, don't be fooled by those so-called bio-writers, novelists, screenplay writers, movie producers, because the more you try to describe a historical person, how great or how bad they were, less and less facts you will get, you will end up being a fool.The darkest hour of this guy's life or the darkest hour of all the British citizens was when they were holding their breaths to see if America would have thrown themselves into the WWII. It got nothing to do with what this guy said to his people. If the 'What if' scenario realized in the end, the British or the Allies lost the war, this guy's speeches or other known figures's big words would have become totally meaningless. When Hitler could use his own bullshit to fool 95% of his German citizens, every word he said to the Germans was nectar and honey, and if he won the War, all the speeches he gave to his people of the Third Reich would become the 2nd Bible or the new edition of a New World Order. But he lost, so he became the crazy monster and Churchill became one of the greatest and most memorable figures in human history. Winner takes all, that's not just an iron-clad rule in today's political, financial, or any form of competition. If Hitler won the War, everybody would have said 'See, I told you he's right, he's the true leader of the world.' and his speeches, his words and his biography would have become the textbooks that every student, every citizen had to study, Hitler would just become the 2nd Messiah, Chairman Mao or Stalin would only qualified to be his little brothers, even his fart would be smelled so good and so refreshing.So folks, don't be so stupid to watch all the re-runs of these political figures, winner or loser won't change anything, because no matter how they had either won or lost, the world would still become so f@@ked-up.I didn't learn or know anything new from this dramatized film, only thought Gary Oldman, who used to play bad guy in most of his movies, now finally got a chance to play an overly praised historical good guy and won a lot of trophies and awards, good for him and, that's all.",,Anonymous,Biography
Treasure Box of Talents,"A very welcome New Year Treat with a cracking script, crisp direction and an engaging cast. Usually, portraits of Winston Churchill tend to be focused on a fully empowered man, complete with legendary wit, oratory and fighting spirit. What makes Gary Oldman's Churchill stand out is his nuance of character, exploring the doubts and frailties of a man at the centre of political intrigue and the weight of impending history. The dialogue is riveting as you are drawn into a very complex dance of war or peace. The events leading up to Dunkirk are explained clearly with the resulting urgency to evacuate bringing a tension to the story total lacking from last summer's, ""Dunkirk"".

Oldman is Great but Churchill was Much Greater than the Film Portrays,"This is the best performance by Gary Oldman. Best likeness of Churchill. Very accurate telling of the times and circumstances.That being said, Churchill himself was a consummate bad-axx in almost every way but the film portrays the great man too often as a drunk, mean, confused, scared and timid old man. It almost implies that Churchill 'fell' into the PM position through luck and bumbled his way to success. It also implies that he was overly-dependent on the females in his immediate circle (his wife and secretary), without whom, he'd be practically helpless which was not the case.On the contrary, Churchill was brilliant, driven, focused, opportunistic (in a positive way), defiant, ruthless, self-reliant, cunning and kind. Truth is, he'd been actively preparing, maneuvering and angling for the PM-ship for decades- making conscious and calculated decisions all through his career with this end objective always in mind as his number 1 priority. He had dedicated his life to studying world affairs and politics even when he held no meaningful political office or military position. He wrote millions of words contained in many, many volumes of his thoughts, observations, speeches and historical accounts. Another point that people are often incorrect about is that Churchill himself was not born into a 'rich' family of the aristocracy. They were very poor and he had to work to make the money necessary to buy his own uniform and horse when he joined the cavalry. It was only when his books and other writing contributions began to make money did he ever actually HAVE any money. He did well later in life with his income from his writings and speeches but he was never GIVEN anything and inherited nothing from his parents (father unknown). Some people seem to think he was born into the PM-ship through unearned privileged, but this couldn't be further from the truth. He may have been 'born FOR the PM-ship', but he definitely wasn't 'born INTO it.'Also, Churchill was a very active and vigorous man, even in his old age beyond WWII. The film does not portray this vigor and energy accurately. Rather, he comes off in many scenes as a defeated, dejected and tired old fool. It is true that Churchill had a roller-coaster ride of a career and he did at times suffer from depression but he never let it beat him down. While the mannerisms and general historical facts about the times are superbly on display in the film, Churchill's towering force of personality and moral clarity is sadly not given anywhere near full justice here. For an excellent bio of the great man, I recommend 'Churchill' by Paul Johnson. It much more accurately depicts Churchill's true personality and character. One of the best things about this film is that by viewing it, some people may be inspired to learn more about this towering figure of history. There is plenty of great 'first-hand' material written by Churchill himself that would make life-time of reading and study.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

Timely reminder of Churchill's greatness,"As a proud Brit it is very easy to love this film. Winston Churchill was a great man who served his country so well during a time of crisis. This film focuses on that time and his role, so there is much to love about it.Of course neither the film nor Churchill are perfect.Churchill's pre-WW2 record was marred by a series of mis-judgements and failures. The film does not duck these. Furthermore, Churchill was a man of the Empire and many of his attitudes and beliefs were framed by his personal experiences of imperial Britain. As a result he became out of touch with changing perceptions even during his own lifetime, and today is easily criticised. But none of this is to deny the immense services he performed for Britain and the world before and during WW2.The film's failings are less significant than Churchill's. Not every scene rings true. The obvious example is the much debated one on the London Underground. But I actually find myself tearful as I watch it. Even though it is clearly invented and rather unlikely, it captures something of the wartime spirit of the British people and also of Churchill himself.A great man. It's a shame that some modern audiences need to be reminded of his greatness.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Churchill - but for the tabloid newspaper readers!,"This is a poor film that was chiefly rescued by an outstanding performance by Gary Oldman as Churchill, fully the equal of Robert Hardy, and very good performances from the other leading actors. In spite of that, the Churchill we see here is a blustering buffoon who shouts at anyone who disagrees with him and relies on people in the street (including the obligatory ethnic minority types) telling him whether he should make peace with Hitler or not. Utter nonsense, of course, and completely non-historical. Churchill had very good reasons for continuing the war and defying Hitler and without these reasons he would himself admit that he would have had no choice but to negotiate. These reasons were not analysed and all we get here is an obese blowhard who throws hissy-fits and invokes ancient history to justify his decisions. This is history for the tabloid readers, not for the intelligent audience seeking 'real' history. This film was a huge missed opportunity to delve deep into a fascinating period of history and find the rationale behind many of Churchill's decisions.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography

a turning point,"Greetings again from the darkness. Cinematic historical dramas, by definition, face the challenge of overcoming a known and documented outcome. Director Joe Wright (ATONEMENT) and writer Anthony McCarten (Oscar nominated for THE THEORY OF EVERYTHING) attempt to re-create the tension-packed few days that literally changed the course of history and the free world.It's May 9, 1940 and the film takes us through the next 3 weeks of political wrangling that begins with Winston Churchill (Gary Oldman) being named Prime Minister almost by default, as he's the only candidate acceptable to both parties to replace an ill and weak war time leader Neville Chamberlain (Ronald Pickup). Even King George VI (Ben Mendolsohn) is skeptical of Churchill and prefers Lord Halifax (Stephen Dillane), his friend who is likely better suited as Churchill's adversary and a contrarian than as the actual decision- maker in this crucial time.Uncertainty abounds within the government and the top priority of debate is whether to negotiate a peace treaty with Hitler and Nazi Germany, or fight on against seemingly impossible odds in hope of maintaining the nation's freedom. Perspective is required here, as at this point, Germany was viewed as an unstoppable military force with Hitler as the leader. The war atrocities and his despicable vision were not yet fully understood. FDR and the United States declined to help and Churchill had few allies inside or outside his country.We can talk all you'd like about history, but more than anything, this is a showcase for the best working actor who has never won an Oscar, Gary Oldman. This is an actor who has played Lee Harvey Oswald and Sid Vicious, and probably should have won the award in 2012 for TINKER TAILOR SOLDIER SPY. Earlier this year, I was impressed with Brian Cox as the lead in CHURCHILL (which was set four years later), but Oldman's Churchill looks, sounds and moves like the real thing. We see the familiar profile and silhouette in numerous shots, and it's actually kind of thrilling.The always great Kristin Scott Thomas plays wife Clementine, and she shines in her too few scenes. Lily James plays Elizabeth Layton, Churchill's bright-eyed secretary and confidant, and she has a couple of nice exchanges with Winston – especially the one explaining the ""V"" hand gesture. Another favorite line has a character state, ""I love to listen to him. He has 100 ideas every day  4 of which are good  96 of which are dangerous."" It's this type of writing that emphasizes the opposite approaches between this film and Christopher Nolan's DUNKIRK, which utilized minimal dialogue as opposed to the emphasis on words taken by Mr. Wright's film.We go inside the House of Commons to experience real political gamesmanship, and see the hectic activities inside the war room as typewriters are being pounded while strategies and alliances are being formed. It's an example of politics driven by a fear of action (by most) while there is a touch of hero worship as Churchill stands alone for much of the film. Some creative license is taken as Churchill rides the Underground (subway) in order to connect with citizens and take their pulse on war  despite most having no clue just how desperate things are. We see tremendous and tragic shots of Calais, and the wide range of camera work really stands out thanks to cinematographer Bruno Delbonnel, who also masters the indoor lighting and shading.Operation Dynamo at Dunkirk is discussed briefly (this would be the perfect companion piece to Christopher Nolan's masterpiece from earlier this year), but mostly this is the personalization of those who politicize war. The good and bad of history is made up of people, good and bad. Yes, there are a few too many Hollywood moments here, but Oldman does capture the pressure, isolation and belief of the historical figure who helped save a country, and perhaps the world. We hear two of Churchill's most famous speeches: the ""Never Surrender"" speech to Parliament and ""We shall fight them on the beaches "" prompted by the red glow of the ""on air"" radio light. There are many published books that provide more detail, but Oldman's performance does guide us through what the Prime Minister must have gone through  and that's worth a ticket and a gold statue.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Never Knew Churchill was a Borderline Dimwit,"You need only watch 30 minutes of this movie before you can be assured Churchill was incompetent in all things prior to his WWII role as PM, and then only bright enough to barely get by. He struggles to put together complete sentences at times and has the respect of very few. It takes his wife to rally him out of bed and tell him how to act to his transition to PM. Wow, what a terrible portrayal. Yes, he had his flaws but exhibited a greater strength of purpose and character in real life. In trying to humanize him this movie has downplayed his enormous contribution and his example of what it really takes to stand up to tyranny. Of course the weight of historical evidence forces the director to eventually portray him in a more favorable light. This movie lacked anything compelling and was the equivalence of an average to mediocre History Channel presentation.",2.0,Anonymous,Biography

Costumes and, more importantly, make-up are done perfectly. Gary is almost unrecognisable and all the 40s suits and dresses catch an eye. The same goes to cinematography, but it is such a common subject recently, I can't tell if it was something out of the scale.

Nationalism is over the limit.,"Not wanting to despise everyone's work in the movie, but no, it just does not. The film shows when Winston Churchil assumed the post of prime minister in 1940 and shows the difficulties in which he passed. The problem is not this, and how the story of the 2nd war is told. Anthony McCarten, the writer of the script, did everything to put England on a pedestal, written: the heroine of World War II. It puts all the rest of the countries like losers, villains, the one that error.
With that mistake, let's talk about the good things in the movie. Yes, Gary Oldman does a bitch for a performance, no doubt the best of his career. The design, makeup and costumes of the film are stupendous, especially makeup.

shallow myth-making,"There is a lightness of touch to Joe Wright, a frivolity, that invades the tone of this film and sets it off-kilter. Any biopic takes on the challenge of creating drama and tension from events we may already be familiar with. This is perhaps more pronounced when it comes to such a titanic historical figure as Churchill. The film rightly invests its time in showing just how fraught the political struggle Churchill faced to fight rather than negotiate was. Unfortunately, Darkest Hour lacks complexity in its portrayal. Churchill shouts at a secretary, who becomes a cheer-leading personal assistant. His wife is similarly one note, admonishing him while managing to steadfastly encourage him at the same time. Halifax and Chamberlain are reduced to vaudeville villainy, while the king is a pompous buffoon. There are some clunky set pieces, most notably a cringe-worthy outing by Churchill on a Tube train to engage with the good folk of Britain. These include a black man, the only black man on the train, and possibly in the whole film, and the most earnest child in the history of Albion. Stalinist propaganda filmmakers would blush at such tokenism. Oldman opts for acting as impersonation rather than interpretation. It's a convincing impersonation, but still mimicry rather than artistry. Wright's depiction of Dunkirk in 'Atonement' had the showmanship of the circus ring, and has been devalued by Nolan's recent more authentic portrayal. Churchill's darkest hour will no doubt be re-visited and re-evaluated in the future when a filmmaker more in tune with the material takes it on.",3.0,Anonymous,Biography

I did miss a few lines his the characterization of Churchill's mumbles but thought Oldman was superb (Gary - you come a long way from Sid and Nancy). Well done indeed chaps. I could not help but think of a certain US president while watching Churchill's portrayal. A tag line of the film perhaps sums up a potential comparison - It takes the power of leadership to unite a nation. I'd add that a united nation is critical in dark times facing a common threat.

And the Award for Best Prosthetics ...,"Gary Oldman's take on Winston Churchill is already winning awards and hotly tipped to take this year's Oscar. Brian Cox gave a more thoughtful performance in last year's CHURCHILL, but he didn't win anything. That's showbiz, I guess.This version looks at the Great Man at the pivotal moment in his career when he replaces Chamberlain as prime minister of a coalition government in 1940, with the British Army facing annihilation at Dunkirk. King George is not keen on Winston (he championed Edward VIII during the Abdication crisis), and he has a 'mortal enemy' in Lord Halifax who thinks he should be leading the country. Churchill's decisions during the First War don't give him a good military track record.There are many scenes in dingy rooms and corridors in the war bunker beneath St James's Park. Even Buckingham Palace looks a bit dour. The movie's best scene, almost certainly invented, is when Winston takes the Underground from St James's to Westminster (a 90-second journey that here takes six minutes) and finds the people are keener to fight on than the Tory members of his Cabinet. I found myself thinking of Laurence Olivier's deliberately hammy Archie Rice in THE ENTERTAINER.Kirsten Scott-Thomas is a grander, less motherly Clementine than Miranda Richardson was last year. Lily James is charming as the PM's shy new typist. Everybody plays down against Oldman's shouty interpretation of Winston. His prosthetics deserve an award of their own and he captures the voice and the mannerisms as well as anybody else has, but other actors have given us subtler reincarnations that, unfairly it must be said, failed to attract the Oscar buzz.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography

You are strong because you are imperfect. You are wise because you have doubts,"Hitler is conquering Europe. Can the English prime minister stop him in time? And should he make peace, or fight?It's absolutely no wonder that this got a slew of awards. It does everything right when it comes to the technical aspects; the lighting is simply immaculate, the cinematography capturing small and grand moments alike, the editing keeps things moving, and Gary Oldman truly disappears into the character, brought to life in part via legitimately stunning makeup.If this were an apolitical piece, I would have no qualms about singing its praises as many others are. But then... that's not even remotely what it is. In fact, the protagonist, as we know today, though unquestionably did do some important things in stopping the Nazis, was also a man who held truly monstrous opinions, several of which are covered in the IMDb Trivia section. This movie makes him appear merely grumpy, quirky and underappreciated. Usually when it mentions one of his negative qualities, it rushes to say something positive, or downplay it.I am aware that he is by many Brits considered a hero, and understand feeling a reluctance to acknowledge his darker side. However, if you are going to depict him, you have a responsibility to do that. This was released in 2017, after the election of Donald Trump, a man that the screenwriter acknowledges is widely criticized, which he finds to be great compared to how disheartening the apathy Bush Jr inspired. Meanwhile, in this script, he doesn't appear to realize all the similarities in hateful views between Churchill and the then American president, or, if he does, he displays no real interest in exploring that. Both support war crimes, colonialism, imperialism, forced labor and concentration camps, eugenics, targeting minorities and fighting civil rights(including for voting) for groups they don't like. This could have served as a warning against re-election, something that he did almost end up winning, despite how awful he was in office. He is one of a growing number of fascist politicians amassing power in recent years, one of the biggest threats to democracy, livelihoods, and even basic safety.

His 1st speech was not cheered b.c. Whole room was in shock. But it was well received. AnD Churchill, a master orator did not need his typist moral support to get through his fight then on the beaches speech. He was a man of many faults.

Oldman shines in this Churchill feature,"Death and taxes, the certainties in life, now have a friend; Gary Oldman the 2018 Best Actor Oscar winner.Like the certainty of our ever encroaching end, there is no chance that well-respected British icon Gary Oldman won't be walking away from this year's Oscar's ceremony without a golden statue for his mantelpiece for his stunning and tour-de-force performance as esteemed English prime minister Winston Churchill.Dominating Joe Wright's dialogue heavy and rather intimate study of the Prime Minister in a very specific time of his life, when he was ushered into the role of England's leader in the heat of German's attack on Europe and in particular England's potentially disastrous Dunkirk situation, Oldman disappears under brilliant prosthetics and make-up and truly becomes Churchill in a turn that shows the iconic figure as a man with a wickedly dark sense of humour, a stoic determination to do what he feels is best and most tellingly, a man that feels the pain and pressure to lead a country in its most bleak time of need.Darkest Hour will not satisfy those seeking an expansive examination of Churchill's upbringing or those seeking war time spectacle but for those looking to get an insight into Churchill's mindset and to get a feel for a man that played such a big part in the greatest war we've ever seen, Darkest Hour will hold your attention throughout and leave you at times breathless from Oldman's turn.Narrowing his focus onto but a few weeks of Churchill's reign and in particular three key speeches the Prime Minister made in the month of May of 1940, Wright's film isn't anything ground-breaking but thanks to Oldman and some key supports, Darkest Hour is one of the rare modern movies that thrives purely off its actors without the usual modern pizazz taking centre stage.Surrounded by quality supports such as Kristin Scott Thomas as Churchill's beloved wife Clemmie, Baby Driver standout Lily James as Churchill's typewriting assistant Elizabeth Layton and Ben Mendelsohn as King George VI, with whom Oldman shares some delightfully awkward scenes with, Darkest Hour is truly an acting showpiece with some added well-established production design and bigger budget sensibilities, assuring that Wright's film feels like more than just a jazzed-up BBC event.At the end of the day though all else within Darkest Hour matters little in comparison to Oldman, very much the captain of this particular cinematic ship, Oldman is the key ingredient to this feature and the reason as to why Darkest Hour has found itself a key part of this year's awards season.Final Say -While there's nothing particularly special about Darkest Hour outside of a well-trimmed script and some fine acting supports, there's something undeniably magical about Oldman's portrayal of Churchill that will go down as one of the most impressive lead turns of the modern movie era and the quintessential embodiment of one of the most iconic political figures of all time.3 ½ wrongly executed hand gestures out of 5",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

The problem is that W. Churchill is presented once again as a hero and as a man of the people which is completely wrong. He was a racist, an imperialist, the worst progeny of ""high British aristocracy"". He was a politician raised in, and formed by, the British Empire. Churchill succeeded in proving himself a man by those imperial standards, fighting in India and Sudan, helping the Spanish suppress Cuba's freedom fighters, and, after a brief South African parliamentary career, fighting in the Second Boer War. Churchill's promotion to home secretary came at a time of still-rising political turmoil in the United Kingdom: Irish struggles for Home Rule, Suffragism, strike waves. Churchill opposed them all violently.He was a ferocious advocate of intervention to quell the Russian Revolution, and wrote furiously about the dangers of the ""International Jews"" (communists) and their ""sinister confederacy,"" against whom he invoked the far more acceptable ""National Jew"" (Zionism).""
The racist said: ""I do not admit that a great wrong has been done to the Red Indians of America, or the black people of Australia . . . By the fact that a stronger race, a higher grade race . . . Has come in and taken its place.""
The war criminal who used for the 1st time in history chemical weapons (against the Bolsheviks and then against Iraq) said :""I am strongly in favor of using poisoned gas against uncivilized tribes""
Finally, in 1933 he praised Mussolini as 'the greatest lawgiver among men"". In 1935, Churchill expressed his ""admiration"" for Hitler and ""the courage, the perseverance, and the vital force which enabled him to . . . Overcome all the . . . Resistances which barred his path.""

great biopic,"It's movies like this that are making me want to learn more about history, but please let me keep doing so through great films!

superb film with stunning acting and visuals.,"Such a superb film with stunning acting and visuals. I can't get over how amazingly Gary Oldman portrayed Winston Churchill. Honestly couldn't have picked a better actor. I also loved the cinematography and set design massively. It captured the film in such a way that it reinforced in why I love film so much. Every time the camera moved through the underground rooms as it followed the characters had in me in awe.I feel like I learnt so much about the war through this film that I didn't know before and found it quite gripping. On occasion, I asked my brother a question to make sure I understood the film correctly as he knew so much more about the war than I did.In general, I haven't seen many films based on war as they are not what I would gravitate towards. However, if more films were told like this, I'd be up for watching them. I would watch this again as I enjoyed it a lot.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
All About Oldman's Performance,"Historical biopics are usually a genre that is right up my alley, as I love seeing historical places/events/people come to life on the big screen. I can't say that ""Darkest Hour"" is one of my favorites of the genre, but it does include an iconic performance from Gary Oldman (that I can say for sure).For a basic plot summary, ""Darkest Hour"" tells the story of Winston Churchill's (Oldman) selection to become the Prime Minister of Great Britain in 1940, with Hitler's Germany having all but conquered the rest of Europe and now knocking on England's doorstep with a seemingly overwhelming force. Trapped between the appeasement talks that government officials want to pursue, and the hard-line stance he wishes to adopt, Churchill must somehow find the conviction to forge ahead and lead the country in one of it's truly darkest times.The big draw here is the stunning performance of Oldman as Churchill. I'll confess that I am not a great scholar of Sir Winston, but from what I do now this seems to be an accurate portrayal of the figure. Visually it is probably the most stunning, as Oldman is utterly unrecognizable from his days as, say, Commissioner Gordon in Nolan's Bat-trilogy or Sirius Black in Harry Potter. Every time Churchill's psyche is probed, that is when this film really, really ""works"", as his internal struggle is what makes the whole thing tick.What I found to be lacking in the film, though, was a sense of something really new being accomplished in terms of plot. I know this is somewhat of an unfair burden to place on a film trying to be historically accurate, but I think the point still stands. In a year where Christopher Nolan released a film entirely devoted to the Dunkirk operation, those parts in this movie (which take up a decent chunk of time) seem dull by comparison. To be honest, I wish the film had focused more on Churchill's political leanings, as I thought that was where the really ""meaty"" stuff resided in the film. Preaching ""war in the face of peace/settlement"" (as Churchill did) is not a popular stance these days, and that is what (at times) really drew me into the narrative. I just wish that would have comprised more time.For me, then, I think the reason why I can't consider ""Darkest Hour"" one of my favorite films is because it is set in a period (WWII) that has been ""done to death"", so to speak. I'm not saying that it still isn't a worthy period to probe, but rather that it is difficult to stumble upon new material while doing so. As a result, from ""Darkest Hour"" I mainly came away with Oldman's remarkable performance, as well as the thought of Churchill being pro-war when so many in his own government favored appeasement. That was easily enough to go no lower than 6/10 stars. The other four stars, however, were lost due to the fact that the other WWII fare in this film was pretty standard and never felt to me like it stood out from other materials I've seen before.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Very good movie,"Gary Oldman playing Winston Churchill showed his true potential.Churchill was a moody and difficult person and Oldman portrayed him as such. The thing I liked most about this movie is that the director showed even the slightest things Churchill did like tapping his ring on the chair. The director also showed Churchill's relationships with almost everybody, from his assistant to his wife to the public to is own party members. During the course of the movie we could really understand Churchill's crisis as he had everybody's support except his own party. The director knew what he had to show and what his aim was as he did not show how England won the war but only how he won the support of the people of his country.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Gary Oldman Is An Amazing Churchill,Gary Oldman shines like the sun as Winston Churchill. He is one of the greatest actors of all time and definitely deserves the Oscar he got for this role. He plays the part in a deeply human and relatable way. He portrays Churchill as courageous but still having some doubts. Churchill didn't give in to tyranny and thank God he didn't or we would all be speaking German under Nazi rule. I love Churchill and Oldman's portrayal of him. This movie shows that courage isn't the absence of fear but having fear and facing it. Churchill had the courage of a lion and it saved England and really the rest of the world from Hitler's grasp.,9.0,Anonymous,Biography
I wasn't' impressed,"Why wasn't I impressed? Gary Oldman is an exceptional actor. His variety of characters through the years has been amazing. But his portrayal of Winston Churchill seemed...off. I feel I've seen better. Bob Hoskins in the Mini-Series 'When Lions Roared' (Thought John Lithgow did a much better FDR than Churchill in 'The Crown'). Hoskins was both brooding and triumphant, as Winston was. And he genuinely fit (physically and emotionally) into the man he was portraying. Then there was Brian Cox in the Mini-Series 'The Gathering Storm'. He too captured Churchill's moods in a way that very few others could.Oldman missed something. Sure, his acting was great, but I believe it to be an 'overplay'. Instead of capturing the essence of Churchill he sensationalized him, making him excited and over agitated far too often. Having seen many portrayals of Churchill, and reading quite a lot about him over my life, this version seemed entirely too....fictional. I think they could have done better.",5.0,Anonymous,Biography
Academy Award worthy!,"Someday, there might be a better movie made about Winston Churchill. But, for now, this is the finest effort to date! It is outstanding. Gary Oldman should hand's down win the Academy Award. If not for the credits, one wouldn't know Churchill was being played by Oldman, and perhaps that's the greatest indication of how well an actor is portraying a character.In terms of history, this movie essentially shows the turning point of World War II in Europe. This is the moment where Great Britain, and by extension the British Empire, was alone against the Nazis and their Axis allies. The closing speech and scene of this movie is where Hitler truly lost his opportunity to turn continental Europe into a Nazi sphere of conquest.The senior level conflict between Lord Halifax, colluding with a recently defeated Neville Chamberlain, while shocking to modern day senses fully educated on the true depth of evil Hitler represented, was portrayed quite accurately in this movie. So, while shocking, it is quite accurate history!It is widely documented that Adolph Hitler fully believed he could sue for peace with Great Britain immediately after defeating France, and firmly believed it was Winston Churchill who kept that from happening. Hitler was correct! There were a number of well known Britons who openly sympathized with the Nazis, and others who simply believed it was necessary to avoid calamity on the British Isle.It is difficult to project the vast changes in human history had the Nazis been able to secure a peace treaty with Britain after the fall of France, and then turned its full might against the Soviet Union. One must wonder, without even the material assistance of the United States, could Russia had singlehandedly defeated the Nazi invasion?Russian people would unanimously claim they would have still defeated Germany, and perhaps they would have. But, without question, the absence of a second and third front would have assisted Germany greatly.Britain's Finest Hour would never have even happened, had not Operation Dynamo succeeded, and had Winston Churchill not rallied the British people to persevere. One can make a salient argument that a Nazi Third Reich would have become a reality, and not simply a near ten year blight upon human civilization!This movie beautifully and faithfully portrays these critical events, centered on a single man, who amid horrible threat and limited options for survival, summoned up a will to inspire a miracle at Dunkirk followed by one of humanity's greatest examples of defeating evil against vast odds.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Welcome to the Gary Oldman Show!,"NOTES
Welcome to the Gary Oldman show, and you Mr. Oldman, you sir, get an A. What a performance! Gary Oldman is an actor I always thoroughly enjoy watching because he completely transforms into his role. This, however, this is a step above and beyond even for him. The performances are superb, the writing is tight, and the pacing is perfect. Christopher Nolan's ""Dunkirk"" from earlier this year approaches the same event in history that ""Darkest Hour"" does, but from the perspective of the soldiers.
REVIEW
""Darkest Hour"" starts out describing the dire situation in which England has found itself in the thick of World War II. England is in need of some new leadership and is desperately close to surrendering to Hitler and the Germans. Enter Winston Churchill, the quirky man whom no one seems to like in the House of Commons, but somehow has ended up on the shortlist of those who can replace the sitting prime minister. Finally, after some deliberation, it is decided that he will be asked to be prime minister only because he is someone who both parties in parliament can tolerate. ""Darkest Hour"" only covers a few weeks in time, and the story is told appropriately like there's not much sand left in the hourglass. Churchill steps into the position of prime minister with his country losing the war, his colleagues scrutinizing his every move strategizing how quickly they can boot him out of office, and a king who is decisively less than thrilled with his appointment. Somehow he must get the edge on Hitler, convince his colleagues they made the right choice, win over the king, and the make a decision that will affect human life for the rest of history - continue to fight or surrender. No pressure! Fortunately, Churchill is a man of cunning, clever wit, and a master of words. He gets the nation on its feet, gains the approval of his colleagues, garners the support of the king, and somehow manages to get England out of the biggest pickle that perhaps has ever been recorded in the history books.
 Joe Wright as director makes some excellent decisions here; he doesn't bite off more than he could chew. Although it does seem like a biopic, it isn't, it focuses on a very specific time frame and does so with Churchill as the main focus. The film's pacing is absolute perfection - it feels like a thriller. I'm not a historian, but I'm familiar with the fact that England did not surrender, and that Hitler was eventually defeated, and despite this basic knowledge I still found the movie beautifully suspenseful in a taut, fuse-burning kind of way.
Let me comment on perhaps the single aspect that I didn't like, that some critics are going out of their way to praise - the score. At times I felt myself being taken out of the movie because the score was so overt, really obviously telling me how to feel. It wasn't constantly overbearing though, sometimes it was wonderful, but it noticeably took over center stage at times. 
Lily James as Elizabeth Layton, Churchill's personal secretary is a treat. I adored her performance. She presents a young woman who is completely taken aback by the monstrosity that is Churchill, yet after time warms to him, becomes loyal to him, and appreciates his quirks. The elegant Kristin Scott Thomas as Churchill's patient wife had less screen time than I'd hoped, but made her scenes count, contributing to the tone, and the overall character of Churchill. Ben Mendelsohn plays King George VI with grace and draws the audience to sympathize with him as an honest man who is uncertain about where and in whom to place his faith.
Gary Oldman as Churchill might be the most convincing performance I've seen since Daniel Day-Lewis' portrayal of Abraham Lincoln in ""Lincoln"" (2012). There are many aspects to his Churchill that are downright genius. First and foremost is the makeup. Kazuhiro Tsuji has perfected his craft and his masterpiece is Oldman as Churchill. I honestly could not tell where Churchill ended and Oldman began. Not once, and I was looking. It is astounding. Beyond appearance, Oldman inhabits Churchill as a slightly edgy, maybe crude, eccentric, and very intelligent man with numerous quirks and flaws. I'm no expert on Churchill, but I've seen various portrayals and there is something in Oldman's eyes that sets his interpretation apart, that captures the wildness Churchill seemed to possess - a man on the edge of something brilliant or something disastrous, and either way wreckless to some degree. The most interesting relationship is between King George VI and Churchill. Articulate and eloquent people seem to hold a power over others, and Churchill was one of those people, so he must've been intimidating, even to a king, especially one who stammers. The tension between the two is palpable on screen and the power dynamic offsetting each other is captivating.
Churchill is written with great attention to detail and nuance. None of his famous speeches are overblown or Hollywoodized such as Bill Pullman's ""We will not go quietly into the night!"" speech from ""Independence Day"" (1996), which I love and gets me in the feels every time, but I recognize is Hollywoodized in every sense of the word (come on, aliens are taking over the world and the U.S. president is on the front lines of a last ditch effort hyping up the pilots who will most likely face certain death....can you imagine our current president doing something like that? Yeah, me neither). No, Churchill isn't one who'd confidently grab the mic, puff out his chest, and deliver. He is one who would methodically go over every word and punctuation mark, every pause and change of pitch in his voice. Oldman brings that contemplative, intellectual Churchill to the screen with crisp tenderness. We see Churchill as of course, the boisterous, sarcastic, quick-witted silver tongue he's become notoriously known for, but we also see him as a man crumbling under the weight of an impossible task, under the weight of a nation losing the largest war in the history of the world.
I walked away relieved that Churchill had done what he'd done, and that the nation of England had exhibited a fighting spirit during the most difficult time in its history, but I also walked away questioning every move he'd made much like I would after a truly inspiring lecture in a college classroom. I was informed enough to involuntarily place myself in Churchill's shoes and identify with the weight his decisions carried. Should we stand and fight or should we try to reason with the enemy and seek peace. Can you reason with a madman? Should you stand and fight a tiger? 
Also, if I were to buy this movie I would definitely purchase it along with ""Dunkirk."" The two films tell the story of the same event in history from totally different perspectives, and I think complement each other so well, it's almost as if it had been planned.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

"Oldman playing old, but still strong Churchill. Do we need to say more? Yes, why else would I write such a long review!","During the early days of World War II, Britain faces its darkest hour as the threat of Nazi invasion looms. The fate of Western Europe hangs on the leadership of the newly-appointed Prime Minister Winston Churchill (Gary Oldman).Also starring: Kristin Scott Thomas, Ben Mendelsohn, Lily James, Stephen Dillane, Ronald Pickup et al.""Darkest Hour"" is one of the best-reviewed movies of this Oscar season, and has gathered quite a nice reputation thanks to both reviews and word of mouth.It's not bad but I have to admit that I came away unimpressed, and started feeling bored after the first 50 minutes or so - which means even before reaching the midpoint of this quite long movie.Everybody's talking about Gary Oldman being sensational as the legendary Churchill, and he is cool indeed, commanding the story deftly with his veteran actor magic.There's actually not much room for others but they manage to leave a mark too, notably Scott Thomas as Churchill's wife and Ben Mendelsohn as King George VI. These two are the main characters through whom we get to catch glimpses of what the great Churchill might have been actually like in real life.But this is where the must-see ends, I'm afraid. ""Darkest Hour"" was produced with 2017/18's awards season in mind, with the typical shortcomings of such kind of ""prestige project"".Meaning that the story is shallow and concentrates mostly on showing aged Churchill shambling around like a cigar-, alcohol- and bacon-loving zombie, not on what exactly makes him such a legend of historical figure.Yes, just seeing the great man is nice, and would make a great sketch, or short movie, or even a supporting character in some other movie. But for a screen story lasting over two hours, this approach feels like a one-trick-pony who's exhausted before the end of the journey.There's some but not enough explanations, be it through saying or showing, what exactly is so special about Winston Churchill, neither as a human being or politician being able to convince Great Britain to stand up instead of surrendering to Nazi threat.Based on his great speech in the end, I didn't even buy him winning all the other leaders over. So, I'd conclude that the movie is a bit underwhelming as a whole, and the leading man alone can't quite remedy that.For me, director Joe Wright's works have always been more about interesting story and good actors than enough nuance to make them really memorable. And this is true in ""Darkest Hour"" case too.Having said that, Oldman and his performace are good drawing cards for sure. It's a award-winning turn, and steady show from veteran thespian who doesn't need to prove anything anymore.Oldman's greatest artistic achievement here is ability to bring out two sides of Churchill: an old and tired geezer who's most comfortable in the company of food, drink and smoke AND powerful orator and politican who has not lost his strengths to withering body and mind just yet.The make-up and hairstyling used to make Oldman look older can't - and are not meant to - hide the sharp, ferocious, wolf-like energy still ticking behind the crumbling facade.During the moments when it shines through, we get the best of him on screen, and the best of the performance. There's only a small problem of having to wait about 50 minutes to see any of that. The first act of the movie is satisfied on showing just how cool is to see Oldman as Churchill instead.There's nothing inherently wrong with a movie being made with awards season in mind, or being based on one strength. But it should last less: there's simply not enough interesting content to justify 126 minutes' running time.""Darkest Hour"" has been nominated for six Oscars, including best movie, actor (Oldman), make-up and hair, cinematography, costume design, production design.Oldman and make-up department seem to have strong chance of winning, especially considering the veteran thespian turns 60 soon and has been nominated for Oscar only once so far (with ""Tinker Tailor..."").",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Great Film, Great Diplomacy","Many people have complained that this film does not paint the full picture about who Churchill really was, and that it does not include enough commentary about other countries. And to that, I say that is rubbish.This film is not about Hitler, FDR, the Canadians, or the Belgians and French that were critical in letting the British escape Dunkirk. It is about Churchill. Plain and Simple.If you enjoy diplomacy, you will love this film. You feel like you are making every decision with Churchill, and that he truly has to carry the weight of the world on his shoulders. Gary Oldman is fantastic, and the secretary is also superbly acted. A little unbelievable in one or two scenes, but its ridiculousness serves to portray Churchill as a ridiculous leader. If you hate Hitler and like Churchill, which is everyone, and you find WWII fascinating, you will like this film",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Energetic Historical Drama,"I put off seeing ""Darkest Hour"" forever, and pretty much assumed I would only watch it, if I ever did, when it hit Blu-Ray a few months from now after awards hoopla had died down. I figured Joe Wright + historical English biopic + awards bait performance = snoozer. But then the film was nominated for a buttload of BAFTAs, I started to get the feeling that it would be nominated for a Best Picture Oscar (which it was), and the Oscar completist in me finally convinced me to see the damn thing.So the fact that I thought it was pretty darn good can partially be chalked up to very low expectations. But I also think this film resonated with me, and appears to be doing so with many others if box office receipts and awards attention are any indication, because I needed a movie like this right now in our dark times. I need to believe that there are leaders out there who have the best interest of the people in mind. I need to believe in a time of national pride (even if not American pride) and the ability of a country full of citizens to ban together for a cause that is much bigger than any one individual. Is the film historically accurate? Oh, probably not. Even if the facts are generally right (and I don't know whether or not they are), I imagine much has been embellished for dramatic purposes, and I know that one scene, in which Winston Churchill rides the underground and polls a group of everyday Londoners on their thoughts about fighting off Nazi Germany or giving into peace talks, was outright fabricated. But I don't care. That stupid manipulative scene worked on me even as I knew I shouldn't let it.As for the movie itself, it's slick and extremely well made, clicking along and maintaining a blistering energy. It looks glossy as a magazine, and Gary Oldman, who will most certainly win an Oscar, leaves not a bit of the pretty scenery unchewed. But he does deliver one of the better biopic performances in recent memory, because he chooses to create an actual character rather than a blustery impersonation.And in a happy accident, ""Darkest Hour"" happens to be a perfect companion piece to another Best Picture nominee from this year, ""Dunkirk,"" as the battle at the center of the latter film plays a major role in the plot of the former.Grade: A-",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
The Most Disappointing Film of 2017,"I had high hopes for this Winston Churchill biopic directed by Joe Wright, but it unfortunately fell well short of my expectations. It is simply an utter shame that while this is very far from the worst film of the year, it's undoubtedly the most disappointing one.The film's narrative takes place during May 1940. The Nazis are beginning to take control of much of western Europe, and Winston Churchill is named Prime Minister after a dissatisfied government in Parliament convinces Neville Chamberlain to resign. Much has been said in the press about Gary Oldman's performance as Winston Churchill. While he does a fine job, the somewhat overdone nature of his performance makes clear that it is unfortunately not the Oscar slam-dunk performance we were all hoping for. The film's supporting cast, however, is quite good--as is the rapid but engaging pacing of the story's narrative.Unfortunately, what makes ""Darkest Hour"" a miss is the sad truth that the film's script is a disaster. The film exhausts itself with virtually every cliché in the biopic/historical costume drama genres, such as: young female characters that basically do nothing except help the male protagonist, a large group of strangers introducing themselves to the protagonist after recognizing him, a sentimental climax meant to simply 'tie everything up' rather than make the audience reflect critically on the subject of the biopic, etc. The writing fails to address the points that made Churchill such an effective leader. All in all, while not terrible, this is a very bland biopic that was a huge letdown for me. 4.5/10",4.0,Anonymous,Biography
You cant compare this to computer animated junk,"Just got back from seeing Darkest Hour. I will give it 5 stars out of 5 stars. As you know I am not part of the CGI movie generation, I will not go to movies that are manufactured and have little dialogue and take time to review them, I will seriously only review movies that are either Historically accurate or Movies that do not rely on special effects. Given that...
Because I was raised with a World War 2 Family, I will say from the acting standpoint, this is Gary Oldmans' finest. Those of you who know me I am a Gary Oldman fan, going back at least 15 years to his roll in Tip Toes. Gary Oldman is an actor who transforms himself to the point you do not realize its him until you look closely. Not only did he absorb the roll of Churchill, he became Churchill. The aspects of Left/Right and Politics of World War 2 played out and for the uneducated or those who are not WW2 buffs, will be reminded of the politics surrounding WW2. 
The story was simple, there were no flying ships or space oddities and the special effects of transforming Oldman into ""the oldman"" were nothing but amazing. 
Please bring your parents, grandparents or whom ever you are blessed enough to still have in your life that remember World War 2, and let it be a reminder to those who have no idea that really the world has not changed much politically in over 70 years.

Lacks Depth,"The script is quite mediocre. If you don't already know the history of this story and what an icon Churchill was, then you might be impressed by this movie. For me personally, I had expected more depth and to learn more about the astonishing personality of Winston Churchill. The tacky sense of humor really killed the movie for me as I could not take it seriously afterwards. I believe the entire movie was focused on his speeches which they'd forcefully add much drama and effects to it to try to get you into him. The rest of the movie felt like a filler to be honest.The only plus points go to Oldman for the amazing performance and to the make up team as they did a splendid job on him. I just wish the camera wasn't so up close to Gary during the whole entire movie. Okay, we get it, you're proud of the make up. Can we zoom out now please?Lily's character was absolutely unnecessary to exist in th first place.Overall, very weak writing/directing. It lacked the emotion and spirit Dunkirk had.

Intimate period of WW2,"Even if ""The Second World War"" 2000-page volume was never a matter of your passionate interest, ""Darkest hour"" is among the most important and involving biographic dramas over the last years. Joe Wright and Gary Oldman took advantage of a close private three-week story of Mr. Churchill to depict an intimate period of British and world history. Years of 1930-s politics of compromises, nine months of a new World War and future European priorities. All of this revealed by means of few shots of battlefields, a shelter-map with scratches and facial expression of Sir Winston. The Big War is brought up with an introspective standpoint.""Darkest hour"" disposes only three weeks of home politics, which has succeeded in locking the story and perception focus on limited locations, historical figures, but at the same time, on multiple privately-held events of importance. Scene-by-scene progressive tension and Sisyphean Labor of a Prime Minister forms a sense of political suspense on the issue. Your tree of historical knowledge, after all, will not be essential to satisfy the process. Even events done may cause intrigue and positive anxious forestate.We generally sensitive to perceive a story told insofar as our attitude to the protagonist. Gary Oldman has done much more than just got used to the layers of make-up. Throughout these weeks of May 1940, Churchill reinvents himself both as a historical figure and a particular movie character. Towards the end of the second hour a serving dish or our sympathy to this characterful person is being mixed with tones of another emotions. In particular, a sense of personal dignity and our social demand for justice. Herein, the movie expresses a hint of comedian charm and irony. Living history of men and women without artificial sadness. A story about people who argue, hate, have doubts, love, afraid and admit mistakes.*8.5 of 10*",,Anonymous,Biography
The hero,"As I arrived in the theatre to see Darkest Hour I happened to sit next to a British couple who proceeded to tell me they had to come because Churchill was their hero. This is precisely the point. This is not a movie about the start of WWII or about battles or diplomacy. It is entirely about the nomination of Churchill to be Prime Minister by a skeptical George VI and about how he managed to stay in power despite the disdain of his Conservative party and the desperate situation Britain faced as Holland, Belgium and France were overrun by the Nazi Blitzkrieg.Churchill had been disdained by Conservatives and many other Britons ever since his Gallipoli disaster during WWI and also because of his rather fickle association with any British political party, whether Conservative or Liberal. Churchill was also suspect in the ranks of Labour because of his dedication to British Imperialism and his brutal dismissal of all Indian strivings for independence. Churchill had no following but the story is about how he created a following among the British people, one which would only last for five years at most.The film takes place during only a few weeks prior to the rescue of the British troops at Dunkirk. There are no battle scenes to excite the public. There is only his mental gymnastics to defeat the enemy, not Hitler but Lord Halifax and the former Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain who sought negotiations with Hitler about a peace deal.Churchill in a mood of despair even agreed to preliminary feelers to the Axis through Mussolini about a deal, but he at the same time worked for the evacuation of the British armed forces at Dunkirk, perhaps persuading Hitler thereby to let the British flee back home from the danger of annihilation.The acting by Gary Oldman is superb, the best Oldman has ever achieved. But the film has several doubtful features. First, the belated support Churchill found with King George is ascribed to the king's fear of having to leave Britain for Canada, a move for safety which would also make the monarchy weaker than ever, something not desired after the abdication of Edward VIII to marry ""the woman he loved."" Secondly, Churchill's ride to Westminster to deliver his defiant speech against peace with Hitler took place according to the movie on the London tube where he discussed his dilemmas with ordinary Britons whose names he took down and referred to in his speech a few hours later. I tend to doubt the historical accuracy of these two events, especially the tube ride.In the end Lord Halifax, while admitting defeat in the face of Churchill's triumph in Parliament in rejecting anything but blood, sweat and tears, spoke the theme of the movie and of Churchill's whole career. Halifax told Chamberlain who was dying of cancer, that Churchill had mobilized, not Britain and its armed forces, but something evidently more important: he had mobilized the English language. This was an offhanded tribute from someone who disdained Churchill but had to admit his success in oratory, a sort of Cicero for 1940. He expressed the high moral beliefs of Englishmen and Englishwomen in the face of German brutality and monstrousness. Thus Churchill emerges in the film as the hero. The needed support from America would only come with America's entry into war after Pearl Harbor. In 1940 FDR would and could do nothing for Britain. Churchill and FDR needed to thank Japanese Imperial aggression for their own salvation.Thus the movie is only for a very specialized audience, more interested in Churchill as a person than in military affairs. This means its appeal with necessarily be limited to those who seek real understanding, not mere entertainment.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography

Gary Oldman was absolutely brilliant in Oliver Stone's JFK, but I was afraid that casting him as Winston Churchill was a disaster in the making. Sort of like asking Peter Lorre to switch places with Sidney Greenstreet in THE MALTESE FALCON.As it happens, though, Gary Oldman is actually pretty good in the role of the embattled but fearless Winston Churchill. His voice is no match of Churchill's, and in fact it's a lot higher pitched. But the meaning still shines through.Every other review I've read seems to suggest that this movie stands or falls on Gary Oldman's performance alone, but that's not true at all. The thing I loved the most about this movie was not Gary Oldman's bumbling around with a cigar and drink in his hand, trying to look like Churchill. It's the way the other characters react to him -- not always with admiration. Sometimes with fear, sometimes with doubt, sometimes even with horror. But in the end all of them are changed by him to a greater or lesser degree.I never saw THE KING'S SPEECH because I felt like celebrating the British monarchy is not what movies should be about. But Ben Mendelsohn is spectacular ad the English king. I actually felt more for him than I did for Churchill! Here is a man without much character, or much of a brain, yet he's placed in a position where he has to take a stand. It's almost against his nature to have strong convictions, yet Churchill forces him to feel something for England that's entirely personal, maybe for the first time in his life.Ronald Pickup was amazing as the luckless Neville Chamberlain, a man who is remembered today only for his flaws, such as weakness, cowardice, and a gullible reliance on the words of Adolph Hitler. This movie made me see Chamberlain from a different perspective, as a man who knows history will despise him but is too big a man to stop trying to help his country survive. By the time he lifted up his handkerchief at the end of the movie I was in tears.Lily James gives a captivating performance as Churchill's new secretary even though her character is sadly under-written. I do wish there had been some indication of why she was more qualified than any of the hundreds of other girls who must have been available. It made me a little uneasy to see her doing nothing but typing away like a machine for most of the movie -- it sort of reminded me of DOWNFALL. Surely young women contributed more than just their fast fingers and their adoration to England's war effort?One other thing that struck me as both annoying and gratuitously false was the late-night phone conversation between Winston Churchill and Franklin Roosevelt. In real life, these two men had been close personal friends for more than twenty years before World War II even began. They liked each other and trusted each other. But for some reason, (to bolster English pride?) director Joe Wright insists on making FDR sound like a liar, a lightweight, and an all-around twit. FDR did what he could, when he could, and he took plenty of political heat in the USA for forcing through things like the Lend Lease Act. More respect is wanted, gentlemen!Other than that, Darkest Hour exceeded my expectations on many levels. It was poignant, suspenseful, and full of unexpected twists.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Superb, with an outstanding performance from Gary Oldman","May, 1940. Germany has invaded Belgium and Holland and poised to invade France. UK Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain resigns and Winston Churchill assumes the role of Prime Minister. Churchill was an outsider for the role and many of his colleagues have misgivings about his abilities. Even the King has issues with Churchill. From the outset Churchill is opposed to any negotiation with Germany but as the situation in France worsens, certain members of his cabinet think that suing for peace may the best course of action. This not only troubles him deeply but puts his position in jeopardy.Superb docu-drama. Edifying, capturing the situation of the war well and how perilous England's situation was at the time. The issues Churchill inherited and the problems he faced are explored well.Good plot development, and quite accurate, historically. There are a few dramatic devices thrown in to help the story along. These generally don't tamper with the bigger picture though do feel a bit manipulative on occasion.Quite an emotional and stirring conclusion.Superb performance by Gary Oldman as Churchill. Virtually unrecognisable - the film's make-up department did an amazing job - Oldman captures Churchill's mannerisms perfectly. Churchill appears as a multi-dimensional character - strong but vulnerable, strong-willed but with moments of indecision, hero and anti-hero - and this is largely thanks to Oldman's deft handling of the role. Gary Oldman won the 2018 Best Actor Oscar for his performance - the first Oscar of his career - and truly deserved it.Also deserving of their Oscar was the film's makeup team which won Best Achievement in Makeup and Hairstyling.Good supporting performances from a cast that includes Kristin Scott Thomas (as Clementine Churchill), Lily James, Stephen Dillane (as Viscount Halifax) and Ben Mendelsohn (as King George VI).",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Oldman was great, but.....","I've been a reader of WWII history for over 40 years. While I knew Oldman would be a fine Churchill, I hoped that the movie would be historically correct and not ""based on fact."" If nothing else, the movie is forcing me to the history books to brush up on a few things. I won't spoil the movie by going into detail.One thing that I was screaming at the screen over: The movie needs subtitles for the important players. One cannot assume that the person they're looking at in the 2nd scene is Neville Chamberlain just because he kinda looks like Neville Chamberlain. And who knows what the other players in history look like. I really wanted to know who was speaking and what was their role in the government at the time. The viewer is left on their own to figure out who these actors were supposed to be portraying.Like another commentator, I too was surprised when the movie ended. I was so engrossed that the time flew.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Poorly executed,"The history of Churchill at the onset of WWII does not need amateur like melodrama and exccessive artistic licence to become a deep and gripping story on the screen. 
Gary Oldman's attempt while noble fell short of a potrayal true to the mark. Again this may have beed due to script and direction more than personnal talent. However, there were a few hints of what he is capable of. It seemed that the director would be better suited to overseeing romance and old time feel good stories converted to the big screen.",3.0,Anonymous,Biography
You will see the most beautiful acting that ever seen,"However this movie has good story, good cast and good cinematograph but main point that makes this movie so great is Gary oldman.Gary oldman he does such as great acting that no one can deniable. When in the beginning you see him directly give you image about Churchill how he speaks, how he thinks and how he decide for important issues. His acting too convince that always your eyes on him while this movie is drama and sometimes drama movie is boring but this movie when you watching it you don't want to end, I think most of this return to gary oldman's acting.The story of movie is about some days of the beginning of the 1940s that british government argument about are they should stop war against nazi or continue. Churchill he prefers to cantinue war and he doesn't want peace with them. He face many problems many opposition for that.In include while almost every thing in the movie is perfect but main point that makes this movie so great it's gary oldman's acting",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
A tour de force by Oldman,"""Darkest Hour"", an account of Winston Churchill's premiership in the few weeks before the evauation from Dunkirk in May 1940, can be seen as complementary to two other recent films: ""Dunkirk"" by director Christopher Nolan and ""Churchill"" with Brian Cox in the eponymous role. It may be a coincidence that all three works have appeared since the British people (narrowly) voted to leave the European Union, but each of them seems to intended remind us that historically this country has (sadly) always been insular both geographically and politically.As cinema, ""Darkest Hour"", directed by Joe Wright (""Atonement"") and scripted by Anthony McCarten (""The Theory Of Everything""), is an absolute treat. There are some very artful visual compositions and techniques but, above all, this film is made by its actors.A barely recognisable Gary Oldman is simply brilliant as Churchill, conveying powerfully all the varied emotions for which this this complex (and controversial) character is known. This tour de force portrayal deserves all the awards which it will undoubtably win. But the support roles are also quality, notably Ben Mendelsohn as King George VI, Ronald Pickup and Stephen Dilane as the appeasers Neville Chamberlain and Lord Halifax respectively, and Kristin Scott Thomas and Lily James as the women - wife Clementine and secretary Miss Layton respectively - who calm the volcano that is the new PM.As history, however, ""Darkest Hour"" has some serious weaknesses, especially because of something that is not shown and something that is presented as pivotal to the glorious finale.The missing element of the story is the recognition that Churchill was not alone in opposing a peace settlement with Hitler; his Labour ministers - led by Clement Attlee and Arthur Greenwood (who have tiny roles in this film) - were equally determined to fight on. The scene to which one has to take great exception shows Churchill taking the London Underground and seeking the views of fellow travellers who conveniently are a cross section of the popuation but all back resistance to the Nazis. Not only did this incident never happen; it is quite frankly unthinkable and spoils what is otherwise an informative and gripping account of a huge turning point in British history.",,Anonymous,Biography

"""All babies look like me""","9 May 1940; in the fog of war Neville Chamberlain (Ronald Pickup) is struggling with the immense task of trying to contain the ever growing threat of Nazi Germany and their destruction of Western Europe. Calls are made for him to resign and he does so and he asks Viscount Halifax (Stephen Dillane) to take his place. Halifax declines and eventually Chamberlain proposes to the King that Winston Churchill (Gary Oldman) takes his place as he is a popular choice with the opposition. Churchill accepts the position and has the difficult task of deciding whether to broker a peace deal with Germany or go on the offensive in what proves to be his Darkest Hour...Gary Oldham was nominated for best actor for his portrayal as Winston Churchill and after watching this film I can see why. He really does become Churchill - yes you could argue that the bodysuit and all the prosthetics helped to achieve this effect, but Oldman's convincing portrayal and the way he gets into character do go a long way in making the film work. Director Joe Wright working from Anthony McCarten's script does a solid job here too; the film does move along reasonably well and it rarely felt padded out or repetitive. The film also has many powerful moments (many of which are between Halifax and Churchill whose approaches to war are polar opposites). One other thing I liked is that both director and screenwriter gave the film some light-hearted and humourous moments which is always nice to see - it may have got a bit boring if it was serious the whole time.I also appreciated the balance approach that was given to the material; we all know that Churchill was a great prime minister, but it's nice to see that he was represented as being a flawed prime minister. At the start of the film, Churchill is portrayed as a miserable old curmudgeon who takes the job out of a sense of duty rather than desire, but as time progresses he shows his worthiness as a leader.There is one scene in the film where Churchill is riding on a tube to Westminster when he starts to strike up conversations with various passengers. I'm unsure whether this actually happened - (I'm leaning towards a no personally). Regardless of whether it did or didn't happen it was a powerful moment as it highlighted Churchill as being a man of the people and also showed that he had the backing of the public.The only other thing I'd like to add is that this film focuses on Churchill's strategy and planning in trying to quell Hitler's dominance in Western Europe. The film has very little action in it and the scenes of war are also rather limited (in other words those that prefer their war films with more action are probably advised to look elsewhere). However, if you're not put off by lack of action and are interested in World War 2 history then The Darkest Hour ticks enough boxes to make it worthwhile.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Historical Fiction is not Non-fiction,"The most negative reviews posted here seem to center on the fact that this film is not entirely accurate. There are tens of thousands of books and documentary films about WWII and its participants which claim to be entirely historically accurate. Darkest Hour is not one of them. Instead, it is a 125 minute long movie which effectively evokes the drama surrounding one critical month of British history. If critics want a history lesson, perhaps they should visit a library instead of watching movies.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
We Shall Never Surrender,"Oscar season is always a fun time to review movies. More often than not, you'll be able to talk about a great movie with many award caliber aspects. In many ways it has surpassed ""blockbuster-summer-season"", partially because blockbusters are more spread out now, but there's nothing like being able to go see this many different great films in the theater in consecutive days. Darkest Hour is another film in 2017 that will surely be talked about on March 4th, and probably for one specific reason, Gary Oldman.Darkest Hour is a solid film all around, and there's nothing inherently wrong about it, but Oldman's performance stands far above anything else that you could say he overshadows his own film. Maybe that's because I'm just so excited that he may finally get his time to shine on an Oscar stage after being overlooked countless times, or maybe it's because a lot of the material in Darkest Hour tends to lean in the area of political conversation. Naturally a film about Winston Churchill will deal with politics, strategy, and patriotism, which is always difficult to encapsulate on screen without boring audiences. Luckily, Darkest Hour handles that side of things relatively well. Granted, there are some moments I did feel my interest drifting a little bit, but Oldman's performance is easily the most engaging part.The supporting actors are also impressive in their own right. Stephen Dillane, Kristin Scott Thomas, Lily James, Ben Mendelsohn, and Ronald Pickup all play solid counterparts to Oldman's churchill. What helped them is not being very well known actors and hence being able to disappear into their respective roles. Whereas Oldman, who is iconic in his own right, is challenged with becoming someone who most everyone knows about in a very famous prime minister to England at the heart of World War II. It's not exactly a task just any actor can do, and Oldman does it to perfection.As I mentioned above, Darkest Hour isn't necessarily a movie I'll ever re-watch and one could make the argument it's a very formulaic biopic. Be that as it may, there's more than enough that comes from the performances of Oldman and the supporting roster that elevates the film to an Oscar conversation.7.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

Well that was underwhelming,"I was looking forward to seeing this given all the hype. Turns out it is a bit of a dud. They raved about Oldman's costume. IMO he didn't look much like Winston but that was redeemed some by his acting which was first rate. I have seen better Churchills make up wise. Lily James was very good. I am sure she will go on to great things given the opportunity. Plot wise, I felt that the subject could have been handled much better in a 3 or 4 part TV serial. This for me is where Hollywood falls down, they have failed to grasp that TV is in the ascendancy whilst they flounder. Most homes nowadays have large screens. 
Why the fantasy items. There is no evidence Churchill ever took the tube and interacted with common folk. Then the virtue signalling was unnecessary. And the tube ride from St James to Westminster lasted 5 minutes when in fact it is one stop and should have been just 1 or 2 minutes. Makes me wonder what else was made up.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography

Never surrender,"Darkest Hour is about one of the toughest crossroads the British Commonwealth and Winston Churchill went through: the former having to choose whether to negotiate with a rising dictator to let them keep their independence and in exchange support Hitler as he rules all over Europe, or to be the lone resistance against the tyrant where many of its other comrades has easily fallen to; the latter alone in wanting to fight the Germans until the very end, in a sea of voices favoring negotiated peace talks. The build-up and tension are palpable and there were crucial moments where you can really feel that the end is near such as the Royal Family being asked to escape to Canada and rule in exile and whether it was better to sacrifice 4,000 men in the Siege of Calais in order to save 300,000 in Dunkirk (whose adaptation is in contention for Best Picture this year.)Gary Oldman's nomination for Best Actor for portraying Churchill is well-deserved. I have seen a couple of Churchills before (most recently John Lithgow in The Crown) and Gary's showed the most resemblance. You can barely make out his face except for his eyes which is still an enigma as when he played Sirius Black in the HP movies. Other notable performances include Kristin Scott Thomas as Clemmie (my aesthetic if I ever decide to grow old), Ben Mendelsohn as the embattled but still calm King George VI, and Stephen Dillane who you may miss as Stannis in GOT.On a side note, I am fortunate to have come across and fell in love (okay somewhat obsessed) with Netflix's 'The Crown' that it felt like a reunion of sorts when I saw Clemmie, Eden and Bertie, which helped as I am usually averse towards war-themed movies. Also, was it too much to ask for to have shown a little Elizabeth running around Windsor Castle? Missed out on a golden opportunity there.Lastly, this movie has stirred up a debate as to whether Churchill is deserving of such commemoration, owing to his views on superiority of Whites over other races (which some say was very common back in the day) and how he handled the Indian independence among others. It's true he was great in some aspects and the worst in others, but it does hold true of one of the many attributable quotes to Churchill: History is written by the victors.Favorite quote (there's too many but this one sums up the movie):
""He mobilized the English language and sent it into battle.""",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Companion film to ""Dunkirk"", explores the role of Churchill.","My wife and I watched this at home on DVD from our public library system. I was a decent student back in high school but I learned more WW2 history this year than ever before with this movie and its inadvertent companion, ""Dunkirk.""Where ""Dunkirk"" started with British and French troops hemmed in at Dunkirk by German troops, and depicts the miracle evacuation of most of those 400,000 men, this movie ""Darkest Hour"" depicts what was going on in England during those days, focusing on the ""war room"" and newly appointed Prime Minister Winston Churchill.Gary Oldman received many awards for his performance, in elaborate makeup, as Winston Churchill. His awards are well-earned as I was almost able to forget that I was watching an actor. Churchill in total is a controversial person but in this one specific case, with the future of Great Britain as stake, his being adamant about fighting until the end rather than negotiate with Germany was a turning point in WW2.It is a long movie at just over two hours but never boring, always interesting, even though certainly some details were changed or fabricated for dramatic effect.

Dunkirk's little brother with Iron (Old)man,"Well it was your typical very dry old fashioned political biopic with a strong resemblance of ""The Iron Lady"", just without the kitsch.
The film lives and breathes from the tremendous performance by Gary Oldman. Its not all about make up, which was flawless, it is really about the performance because Oldman manages to give his character so much soul beneath the dozen layers of make up. Not only does he perfectly captures the mannerisms, voice and wit of Winston Churchill, no he shines most in the silent moments (when Lily James' character tells him about her brother, or the scene in the subway). 
Kristin Scott Thomas is also good. Its really not a showy performance in any way, but she does little wonders with it. And she was perfectly cast as well. Ben Mendelsohn is good as King George VI and has some memorable moments. 
Where the film lacks a bit is the direction, because it was rather uninspired (besides some good camera ankles ) and the rather boring screenplay. They should have given us a much deeper insight than just showing historic facts and famous speeches. It would have been a great opportunity. Well, towards the ending it gets some drive but really truly lives from Oldman's performance and thus serves perfectly as a vehicle for him.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
You have never seen Winston Churchill like this before.,"There have been many Winston Churchills on screen and television, and although none of them have been completely convincing, they all managed to get as close as possible, which, although far from the goal, anyway generally were good tries. I wouldn't say that Gary Oldman is the best so far, but he is at least on level with Albert Finney, while Kristin Scott Thomas definitely is the most beautiful Clementine of them all. I always admired her deeply, she adorns every film she partakes in, she is intelligent and beautiful, which is an invincible combination - she just has to appear, and she turns any dreadful story to something deeply interesting. Her perhaps least successful appearance was in ""The English Patient"" as the romantic lead - she is only superior as a leading supporter.As for the rest, Roland Pickup makes a very convincing and almost heart-breakingly melancholy Chamberlain, all too clearly singing on his last verse, who is the only tragic figure of this movie. The others are all quite all right.The music by Dario Marianelli was a positive surprise, it's very well manufactured, even pointing out and underscoring some comical moments, while the main character of the film is documentary - the effort has been to catch the strain of that terrible first month of Prime Minister Churchill's, which ambition definitely is achieved. It couldn't have been made better.So without flinching I join all the other 10-voters and hope to see the film again.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

All the support cast are great as often larger than life but real characters with only James seemingly 'normal'.

He was a great inspirational leader, but Brookes his CIGS ( head of General staff ) was a real hero just reigning in Churchill's wild ideas. Churchill was responsible for the Gallipoli landings in WW1, the fiasco of Norway in WW2, and the soft underbelly which became the tough old gut - Italy.

This film depitcts a man capable against many odds able to resist the easy option of attempting peace negotiations with what was clearly a madman even before the full extent of the horrific atrocities had been identified.

An average motion picture headed by a magnetic performance.,"Darkest Hour was the second Best Picture nominee about the battle of Dunkirk at the Oscars this year. In May of 1940, British troops have been trapped on the beaches of Dunkirk. The Labour party demands the resignation of the incumbent prime minister, Neville Chamberlain. This leads to the controversial Winston Churchill (Gary Oldman) receiving the job of prime minister. Churchill who has suffered criticism for his leadership during the Gallipoli campaign in World War I is a choice that doesn't fit well with the people of England including King George (Ben Mendelsohn) himself. In this darkest hour Churchill must find a choice to either fight or to negotiate peace with Adolf Hitler. Without the help of the US government of President Franklin D. Roosevelt, Churchill is pushed to his limits. Darkest Hour is a authentic and slow movie (even though its only 2 hours long). It features a small ensemble of interesting choices led by Gary Oldman in his deserved Academy Award winning performance. He pulls of the small mannerisms of Churchill with such ease, speaks in an authentic accent and looks great in the makeup that Oldman simply becomes Churchill. He is especially convincing in scenes where he yells his speech in front of parliament. Oldman even uses many of the Churchill mannerisms to his advantage to give some comedic relief. This helps the audience to be drawn to his character. The rest of the cast consists of Kristin Scott Thomas as Churchill's wife, she gives him strength and courage and her chemistry with Oldman is perfect. Lily James adds youth and inexperience and Ben Mendelsohn is gripping in his brief role as the King. The film feels authentic due to the great costume which consists of old fashioned suits, uniforms and hats. This together with the production design makes the setting of 1940 London even more authentic. The film makes the smart decision to keep things light hearted when necessary. Especially towards the start which shows Churchill to be somewhat of an outsider and slightly out of touch. Besides the actors, costume or production design the best word to describe this film would be competent. There is nothing interesting about Joe Wright's direction or Dario Marianelli's music. The writing feels clunky and wooden in certain scenes, especially at the start when people exposit about Churchill's character and past. As stated before, the film had some unexpected humour, which works for the most part. However the film unfortunately never becomes all that serious until the very end, and even at that point the picture never really becomes suspenseful. Even with this being a somewhat conventional drama, I would still recommend everyone to see this in particular for Gary Oldman's performance and for the important message of unity. Which in today's world is often forgotten especially in times with 'America First' or Brexit.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

I gave it a 8, as I thought it captured the building tension in London as well as the political tension but, and I think this should be a bigger but, if you listen to Churchill's speech as broadcast, he delivered it with a sing-song, almost ""who cares"" cadence in his voice whereas Oldman delivered it as everyone thought Churchill should have, and WC didn't, which made him one of the greatest speech writers and worst orators of the era.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

Stunning docudrama with an Oscar-worthy lead.,"""He mobilized the English language and sent it into battle."" Viscount Halifax (Stephen Dillane)What a joy to see this superior docudrama, Darkest Hour, exalt language by championing Winston Churchill (Gary Oldman). Although I have spent my career cavorting with words, this film does in two hours what I had always believed: Words can win wars.Although at this point I can see no other competition for the Oscar than Gary Oldman, you may not believe me because you can't recognize him in his role. He does lose himself playing Churchill, not just because of the fat prosthetics, the glasses, and the cigar, but because he channels Churchill's indomitable spirit and endearing flaws with a perfection rarely seen this side of Daniel Day-Lewis.For the complete historical experience, see Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk as a companion, for Churchill's success of the 300,000 soldier-rescue/retreat at Dunkirk made Churchill's legacy and changed the war to a losing proposition for the Nazis, notwithstanding their withering superiority on the land and in the air. 
What makes this doc so memorable is the revelation of Churchill's flaws as well as his genius. He wavers in acceptance of Chamberlain and Halifax's proposals to capitulate to Herr Hitler, yet he can be persuaded by the populace's ""never"" to give in to them as he rides the tube to listen to their heroism first hand.Besides the tour de force performance, Darkest Hour has other splendid moments such as the nose-to-nose confrontations between Mrs. Churchill (Kristin Scott Thomas) and the prime minister. Additionally, director Joe Wright employs his well-known camera acrobatics to keep interest and relay meaning (e.g., the opening camera shot from the ceiling of the House to a close-up of the speaker's left side is ominous about the lofty proceedings and their roots in humanity, and his street-tracking shots are several and realistic.Here's a docudrama to make you weep as you watch real-life heroes struggle in a battle of the mind, and oh, yes, words.",,Anonymous,Biography
Proof that a good enough character can almost entirely carry a film,"Of all the Best Picture nominees for the 2018 Oscar ceremony 'Darkest Hour' was the one I expected to least enjoy going in. Now, I haven't seen them all yet so I can't comment on how close that was to being true, but what I can comment on is the fact I enjoyed it much more than anticipated. The film holds very little in the way of interesting concepts to me, yet it was able to catch me off guard by just how fascinating this Winston Churchill bloke really was.I can't see the film having any chance of winning Best Picture. It is simply too generic and character based to pull off that feat. The nomination itself is about right for the credit it deserves. One award I can see it winning though is Gary Oldman for Best Actor in a Lead Role. He was simply fantastic. He became Churchill. I'm a big Oldman fan and I often had to remind myself it was him in there, based on both the look and character traits he managed to pull off. I would call him all but a lock to win the award.The film is really just there to characterise Churchill. As a film itself it doesn't really have much to offer (the reason I can't see it winning Best Picture). It is basically a very well executed vehicle for Oldman to ride in. That being said punchy dialogue and terrific performances pave these cracks and the end result is a pretty watchable two hours of film.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
An Important Aspect of the Churchill Legend,"Now decades after World War II, we often picture Winston Churchill as the implacable leader who stood prophetically alone in his characterization of Hitler and was gratefully received as Prime Minister by his nation when his predictions were finally proved irrefutably true. Darkest Hour shows that, in fact, English sentiments were not of one mind in May of 1940, and Churchill had not only to chart a critical course in those harrowing days, but do so in the face of substantial opposition to his leadership. It is a side of the Churchill legend often forgotten today, and important for us to remember. Well done, Director Joe Wright!",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Unexpectedly enjoyed this more than I thought I would,"I'm never been a history nut, so I didn't know what to expect going into ""Darkest Hour."" I knew about Winston Churchill, I knew that he gave a ton of iconic speeches during World War II and he helped represent Great Britain, but that was about it.What I didn't know as that Churchill wasn't liked by many people before and during his reign in Parliament. Now that alone didn't get me to like this movie, but I did end up enjoying this a lot more than I thought I would.""Darkest Hour"" benefits from Gary Oldman's fantastic performance as Churchill and how he interacts with the other characters. He's a bit of smart ass, he's great with words, and he has a full on hatred for Hitler that causes him to allow thousands of people to die on the battlegrounds, just so that he doesn't have to have peace terms with the man.He wants to win the war, not surrender, and he goes to the citizens of Great Britain to make sure that they're on his side. And of course they are.The ""Darkest Hour"" wasn't quite good enough to make my Top 10 films of 2017, but it was a really great period piece and if you enjoy anything around the World War II period, you're sure to enjoy it.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

Reducing history to generic myth,"With hindsight, it was absolutely a good thing that Britain was led by the unlikely figure of Winston Churchill during World War Two. The politics around Churchill's ascension to power are very interesting, from the desperate desire of many to avoid war at all costs, to the major role of Churchill's own incompetence during the Norway campaign in the fall of Chamberlain's government. There's lots of good material for a film here, but unfortunately 'Darkest Hour' isn't that movie, preferring to exaggerate both Churchill's heroism and buffoonishness, while painting his political opponents as virtual traitors to the country. Meanwhile, the dramatization of the story reduces it to the banal narrative of a Hollywood biopic, with the premier granted an unlikely epiphany on the London Underground. Gary Oldman buries himself in the character, but it's in the service of myth more then history.",5.0,Anonymous,Biography

A Big V for Victory!,"TL;DROne of the year's strongest biopicsNarrow scope works very well, focusing on just a month and so giving so much detailInformative and enjoyableExcellent performances from the supporting castBrilliant set decoration, cinematography and directionWitty, well-paced writing, though occasionally heavy and exhaustingThe Oscar is absolutely deserved for Oldman (and the make-up) - an incredible performance----------------------------------Every year it seems we can expect at least one Oscar-nominated film recounting the life of a historical figure (this year we have two, Darkest Hour and I, Tonya). These aren't confined to one season, however, and there are numerous biopics coming out all the time. Not all of these are a hit, many being critically panned. However some biopics lauded, both by critics and audiences alike; Darkest Hour is one of these films, instantly becoming an example for the biopic genre in general, largely due to its focus, managing to mix story, struggles, history and personality seamlessly.While many biopics try (often in vain) to chart the life of a great figure from birth to death, Darkest Hour instead narrows its scope to a crucial, captivating month in the life of its protagonist. Churchill is a fascinating character and to tell the whole story of his life in just one film is too big a challenge to really do the man justice. Instead we go on an often intimate journey with him and his early struggles, many of which a great deal of the audience will not be aware of. Personally I had no idea that Churchill experience so much criticism and doubt even by members of his own party. Since there's a lot of history to learn as we watch, heavy expositionary dialogue is almost inevitable. At times such intense and heavy conversations packed full of information can become exhausting and one might find their mind wondering slightly, in need of some light relief. This relief isn't provided often, but that's not to say the film is devoid of comedy. In fact, Oldman's performance of Churchill himself gives us a great deal of comedy to lighten the tone and really improve the overall personality of the film. Still, even when there's a lot of serious discussions going on, it's never dull and always well-written, not getting too bogged down in the dreary and unnecessary details. The moments when we see the full personality of Churchill come through is when the film shines and Anthony McCarten's script perfectly captures the image of the man about whom we hear so many stories. However this is mostly down to Gary Oldman.Oldman is certainly the heart and soul of Darkest Hour. Even if we were to forget the make-up, his performance is outstanding; but with the Academy Award-winning make-up it's incredible how he is transformed and how successfully he embodies Churchill and brings him to life before our very eyes. This is all best seen in a scene that probably never happened in real life - Churchill heads on into the London Underground by himself, astonishing the passengers and chatting with them all. This is Oldman's Oscar-winning performance at its finest; story is temporarily forgotten, and it's an absolute to joy to watch him just be that character, disbelief absolutely suspended, either willingly or unwillingly. Though Gary Oldman certainly seizes the film, the supporting cast support very well. Mendelsohn takes a different approach to King George than Colin Firth, making this character seem more his own, and Pickup and Dillane are perfect as stuffy politicians. Yet it's Scott Thomas and James that are the strongest in the supporting cast, giving both Churchill and the film a strong, kind and womanly touch that the overly male-dominated film needs.Director Joe Wright and director of photography Bruno Delbonnel also include gorgeous aesthetics. The set decoration is sublime, fully immersing us into a WWII London and letting it come to life. More than this, it's all shot beautifully and sometimes theatrically, with some of its cinematography inspiring. These all come together to strongly emphasise either the isolation or the triumph Churchill feels at different points throughout his story.It's obvious from all the talk and even the poster that this is Gary Oldman's film. It's important to remember though that there's so much more to enjoy and applaud. With excellent writing, directing and cinematography, an emotional and realistic WWII London is brought to life, supported by an excellent cast. This is all topped off by an incredibly transformed Gary Oldman, fully evoking Churchill and giving us the performance of a lifetime. A big V for Victory!",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Approved by the Academy...,"The year is 1940, war is raging all over Europe. Poland is occupied, Holland and Belgium surrendered and France is undergoing the Nazi rollercoaster. All democracies are defeated.... All of them? No, an isle commanded by a stubborn Prime Minster won't stop to put up resistance. Yes, I'm an Asterix fan, in case you haven't noticed... and not much a fan of Joe Wright's ""Darkest Hour"", a movie whose very merit draws an interesting parallel with Churchill himself, a man whose heroism could only be unveiled by a dramatic opportunity, a matter of timing. Churchill was overdue a biopic and Gary Oldman an Oscar, and that's that.There's nothing more satisfying than a movie tailor-made to win Oscars and that fail... it's fun to see them stumble and fall and remind a few producers that having movies based on true stories, involving a real-life larger-than-it figure, slightly more eccentric than the average schmuck, with actors who've proved to be bankable, isn't a guarantee for gold. In the same vein, there's nothing more frustrating than seeing the Academy biting the bait. By no means, am I implying that ""The Darkest Hour"" is a bad film, but is it anything new after ""The King's Speech"" or ""Lincoln"". Again, we have a historical figure facing a moral dilemma in the midst of a war on which the future of a country hinges, countless discussions between Chamberlain (Ronald Pickup) and Hallifax (Stephen Dilane) to decide if one should discuss peace and two patriotic and rousing speeches that seal the country's fate. On the paper, it's terrific but on the screen, it doesn't demand more than what a simple play could have provided.Indeed, having Gary Oldman, the actor who made a specialty out of playing original and/or slightly disturbed characters, play the most iconic British figure was an offer fans and movie lovers couldn't refuse but how on Earth did the film, good but never great, garner six nominations including Best Picture. The film isn't a war movie but a huis-clos centering on the month of May 1940 where Europe surrendered to the Blitzkrieg and the British isle became the next target. The conflict is simple: should Britain listen to the terms of Hitler or fight... we all know surrendering won't be an option (so much for the suspense) but the thrills rely on the way Churchill is never totally approved even after his nomination at the head of the country, it's as if he was embodying the country's own insulation. In a way, it's a good premise for a film but I suspect its existence was to be more of a vehicle for Oldman than any attempt to inspire a new interest on the British Bulldog.If you're going to have a movie about Churchill, why not go straight ahead with it, and call it the ""Darkest Hours"", why making it on the cheap and not have anything about the Blitz attacks and the magnificent way the Royal Air Force counterattacked... the film only exists to show the way Churchill win the battle of opinions, while real battles are either won and lost, having glimpses of hesitation at times and be the histrionic chap we expect. On that level, Oldman never disappoints but don't count on me to consider his performance deserving, here's why: Churchill is a living icon, he's hot-heated, hot-tempered, gross and vulgar in a sophisticated way, all you've got to do is chomp on your cigar and chew the scenery anyone would get away with it. A character like Churchill provides so many constraints that it's easier for an actor to depend on them and then let the inspiration take a life of its own. That's why I believe it's easier to play characters like Stephen Hawkins than the role that earned Casey Affleck his much deserved Oscar the year before.Speaking of Hawkins, I called ""The Theory of Everything"" one of the most Oscar-baity films I've seen and ""The Darkest Hour"" reminded me of it, I didn't expect there would be a connection. Screenwriter Anthony MCarten seems to adore crowd-pleasing tear-jerking Oscar darlings, he's not a bad writer but I'm afraid he's diluting his talents in heavy-handed projects that might sometimes end with failed melodramas and he won't make quite a name for himself following that trend, though he did better with ""Bohemian Rhapsody"", a film with a greater scope than Wright's war drama. Now, I didn't want to enter that turf about bait or not bait but when I got to the tube scene, I couldn't help but feel that the film was trying too hard, much to hard to pay tribute to a certain vision of London that would appeal to a 2010's audience and give Churchill a sort of sacred halo à la Gandhi (a man he despised by the way) watching that scene, I thought the real Churchill would roll over his grave.There were enough good biopics lately and it's unfair to make critics on the basis of comparisons but I wish we could have more movies like ""Patton"" or ""Lawrence of Arabia"" making biopic rhyming with epic, and not limiting itself to a timeline where FDR is inexistent and De Gaulle not a name yet, there's a lot of talk in ""The Darkest Hour"", I just wished the film could walk the walk. Rumor has it they're planning a sequel, maybe it's a recognition of how limited for such a grand figure the original was.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Absolutely accept this, Yes, you cannot reason with a tiger when your head is in its mouth","""You cannot reason with a tiger when your head is in its mouth and those who never change their mind can never change anything."" It seems so intense right? Yes, this movie is all about decision-makings that prove the imperative nature of a human mind that too at the brink of war, also a movie based on true events.It was only during my schooldays, I have read about this man, but honestly, I knew nothing about him or I am not a person who has the greatest aspiration in knowing about history. However, this movie captivated my mind, since it is about the uprising from the impending threat to freedom to the Great Britain where people have lost faith with the current leader and they needed someone of relentless nature who could bring the dying spirits to life.Even though the entire cabinet ministry was against the wish of his leadership including the King himself, the unanimous support comes from the very own former Prime Minister who believed him as a person who could withstand the Greatest Dictator the world has ever known. Imperfections always makes a person strong and he is an imperfect leader with a bulldog spirit to fight like a warrior to any imperial conflicts that he endured in his life, exhibiting his instinctual behavior.This movie is all about this great leader who is none other than
""Sir Winston Churchill"" and I was swayed by the first speech in his cabinet as Prime Minister of The Great Britain, which goes as, ""To wage war until victory is won, and never to surrender ourselves to servitude and shame. Whatever the cost and the agony may be, conquer we must, as conquer we shall.""My final verdict is we don't get to know the depth of war, but we get to learn how revolutions emerged, how great decisions were made, and how people of those days chose wisely who their leader needs to be, which we current generation have to learn a lot and this movie is an exceptional one to give such inspiration.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Perfectly fine biopic about Winston,"He doesn't sound like Churchill, he doesn't look like Churchill and he doesn't act like Churchill, but Gary Oldman does a damn good job at playing a caricature version of the legend. He's probably the best on screen version of Churchill to date.I was way too harsh on this film in my initial review. I still don't think it's that much better but before I was switching between a 4 and a 5 out of 10 and now I'm at a solid 6. The cinematography is beautiful and the acting is all great. Sadly though, those are the only things that make this film at all special. The overall plot is way too cartoonish for what's supposed to be a realistic drama film. The score is extremely cheesey as well and sometimes ruins cool moments (which are few and far between).Overall I had a decent time watching it and it was definitely a lot better with subtitles so I could actually hear what they were saying because everyone has such thick accents. It won't blow you away or anything but to history buffs (not me) I'd say give it a try. (P.S. it's logged as the 23rd but in reality I finished it at like 12:02 am) (P.S.S. My mom fell asleep for like an hour and a half and said it was boring so if you don't like films that aren't constantly action packed or cracking jokes than you might not like this.)",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Darkest Hour puts Joe Wright back on track with this patriotic drama.,"Forget about 'Pan', every director is allowed to create one bad film. The important thing is the he learnt from his mistake and regressed back to what he does best, British war dramas. Detailing an important month for Britain in World War II where Winston Churchill is positioned as prime minister. With the weight of the country on his shoulders, he must battle, not just Nazism, but his own parliament. I don't think we can fully appreciate and grasp the enormity that Churchill was faced with. Yes, some bad decisions were made where hindsight acts as a wonderful tool for regret. However, he confronted his own war cabinet and progressed the war with his gut instinct, taking into account the British public that he swore to protect. He eventually became a noble leader in a time of need, to me that is commendable. The film expresses patriotism, conflicting views and fear of war rather well actually. After a shaky start with various narrative stumbles that prevented me from being fully engaged, it sets off in full force and consistently kept me captivated. All thanks to Gary Oldman. In an Oscar worthy performance (in which he absolutely deserves the golden statue), he utterly transformed himself. Another role where he became the character, I can't stress enough that he is one of the best character actors working today. He chewed up every scene, particularly adored the moment Churchill takes the London Underground. Simply just watch this film for his acting alone, you won't regret it. The supporting cast were also decent, although it took me awhile to warm to Mendelsohn...slightly miscast in my opinion. Wright's direction was effective, I loved his bird's eye view zooming and the slow motion tracking shots. The inclusion of British wit was of paramount importance and suited the narrative incredibly well. It may not feel hugely creative or inventive, yet there is an underlying sense of competence both on and off screen that has consequently created an assured drama.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Outstanding but flawed by PC,"A fine portrayal of the greatest-ever Briton during what was indeed the country's darkest hour. But why oh WHY do modern film makers have to include scenes in 'factual' pictures that are ludicrously obvious fiction?

darkest hour,"Am I the only one not impressed by Gary Oldman's performance? Half the time I did not understand what he says as he mumbles or whispers. And I understand the other actors, so it is not a sounding issue. The portrayal of Churchill is as feeble and old, which I don't think he was since it takes strength to carry on what he did. The make up is almost as thick as Bram Stoker's Dracula.
We know Churchill was spiritual and cantankerous, but during the entire movie I only hear one or two real spiritual sayings. 
A more authentic, lively and better performance is given by Brian Cox in the movie ""Churchill"".Other aspects: cinematography is quite good ( due also to the hefty budget).
Music is also top notch. An emotional crescendo is built up by the director up to the final, strings attached, and I recognize I was carried out by it myself.
A common gimmick nowadays is to introduce the perspective of a ""common people"", in this case, the typist girl. Another is (due to political correctness)
to introduce a non-white person, so a black man has the longest frame time in the underground scene.

Joe Wright's Darkest Hour,"Last year ended with a number of good-quality political thrillers. However, for some reasons nobody considered Joe Wright's ""Darkest Hour"" as a formidable rival to Spielberg's ""The Post"". Theaters were almost empty during it's performances and the movie hardly covered the production budget. This represents a rare case when cinema-fans made a serious mistake creating their expectations. Monumental biopic about the life of Winston Churchill appeared to be not another British fake, but rather quite strong masterpiece with impressive cast and great director's work.Movie takes us back to May, 1940. Nazi Germany is about to invade Belgium. British Parliament demands the resignation of Neville Chamberlain from the role of Prime Minister due to his incapability of leading the nation during the war time. The only man whom both party will support happens to be Winston Churchill, then-First Lord of the Admiralty. Although, Churchill was right about the nature of Adolf Hitler, he has a poor reputation in Parliament and a very few supporters. The world is on the edge of terrible events. With the completely unprepared public, with weak king George VI who is not ready to unite the nation, with his own party plotting against him, Mr. Churchill must boldly face his life's darkest hour and make right choice which will finally put his name in the list of the greatest politicians in humans history.Today, politics is considered as something extremely boring. It is hard to imagine exciting movie about, say, Merkel or Obama. However, it was not always like this. End of 19th and first half on 20th century was era of truly great politicians. Some of them were pure evil, some of them were synonyms of goodness. But majority were rather controversial figures. Churchill stands apart all of them. He was a man comprised of contradictions. Perhaps the greatest of all these contradictions was Churchill's dichotomy between public and private life. In the world history, he definitely stands as a bulldog-politician, who became the international symbol of resistance to Nazi far before USSR and USA appeared on the scene. His power as a politician helped to united the British nation during the hardest time in it's history. But not all people know that historical Churchill was also a worldly man. In private life Churchill was insecure, suffered the periods of deep depressions and uncertainty about his own actions. Director Joe Wright tries and explores in full exactly this dichotomy between public and private Churchill.And he succeeded... with the help of splendid work of Gary Oldman. From the creative introductory scene to the very end of the movie, Oldman step by step introduces us to the true nature of Winston Churchill. The way how he walks, moves and speaks are so good that probably now the name ""Churchill"" would be associated in our minds firstly with famous ""V-for-victory"" picture and then immediately with Gary Oldman's tremendous role.On the other hand, there is no good counterpart to Oldman's character. King George VI (Ben Mendelsohn) is quite good but toneless and uncharismatic comparing to the variation which we saw in ""King's Speech. Churchill's wife Clementine (Kristin Scott Thomas), with whom Churchill had loving but uneasy relationships played a nice but unremarkable part. Moreover, it is very hard to justify the inclusion the character of Churchill's personal secretary Elizabeth Layton (Lily Jamesthe) into the movie. All what she does is shedding from time to time unnatural tiers and distorting us from contemplation over truly important characters.In short, the movie deserves to enter the grand series of historical biopics about Second World War era and take place among such ingenuous pictures as Imitation Game, Dunkirk and King's Speech. Despite the lack of critical approach to history and overburden patriotism, the movie is definitely a piece of high-quality art.And in the end, good quote from the movie.Winston Churchill: Will you stop interrupting me while I am interrupting you!",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Stunning and gripping,"I have just seen Dunkirk (another brilliant film), and Darkest Hour seemed to be a brother movie, that teased out much more of the back story to the evacuation of Dunkirk.
Gary Oldman's performance was stunning. The script tight and witty. The drama was present at all times with respite with Churchill's outrageous behaviour. 
Perhaps the only weak spot for me was the Underground train journey to Westminster. It seemed to be too contrived.

Like if it was on a shelf it probably would be that last movie that I picked or I might even leave the store empty handed. With that in mind if you enjoy movies with a dry sense of humor, this is a wonderful film for you to watch. The movie is based around the tense moments during the second world war.

Great portrait of a great man,"I've seen a few Churchill films/documentaries before but 'Darkest Hour' is nothing like any of them. This film does more than just tell a story, it's a fascinating portrayal of Churchill's character, his traits, habits and even his brutal sense of humour. While the film details the events of Churchill's rise to power, the entertainment value comes largely from learning about the man himself.Credit must go to the brilliant Gary Oldman who captures Churchill's character to a tee. Everything from his voice and body language to his subtle mannerisms is perfect, and it's easy to forget that you're not watching the man himself. The highlight for me was Oldman's stirring version of Churchill's famous 'we shall fight on the beaches' speech. 'Darkest Hour' is a great portrait of a great man, highly recommended for those wanting to learn more about Winston Churchill.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Gary Oldman gives the performance of the year in a good, but conventional biopic.","Every year there is bound to be a biopic that is released in the middle of awards season. Films like The Social Network, The King's Speech, A Beautiful Mind have come along and won major awards telling the story of famous men. Darkest Hour perfectly fits this description and will certainly be an active member of this year's awards race. An outstanding and unrecognizable performance from Gary Oldman along with great direction from Joe Wright. While it falls into some conventional trappings, the overall quality is still good and makes for an interesting character on one of history's greatest leaders.The setting of the film is during the month of May 1940. We witness Churchill at his most vulnerable as he has just been given a huge amount of power in a time of looming terror. He has enemies on the opposing side of the war, but also enemies within Parliament as they take problem with his leadership. A large part of the film covers Churchill's decision of how to deal with the battle of Dunkirk, which, like the title, was one of Britain's darkest hours. From here we follow Churchill along as tries to find a solution to a momentous problem that could spell disaster for England and the rest of Europe.The film can get slow and repetitive at some points since it carries a 125-minute runtime and is mainly about Churchill's decision over Dunkirk and the Nazis. Specific arguments and facts are over explained to the point where the film becomes somewhat predictable as to what characters are going to say. There is a small storyline about Churchill's objectors within Parliament, led by the ousted Neville Chamberlain, but that plot wears thin quickly and doesn't come to a very satisfactory end. There are also some overly cinematic moments that are distractingly over the top and take away from smaller scenes that carry more weight to the story.Apart from its small problems, Darkest Hour has a very good script that gives Oldman many opportunities to shine. The dialogue between Churchill and other politicians is almost Sorkin-like in its way to move at a very quick pace but also give you the information you need. The moments between Churchill and his wife are also touchingly done, as both find solace in each others company in troubled times.Darkest Hour is a perfect companion piece to Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk, the other brilliant film that came out this year featuring the titular battle. While Dunkirk showcases the real fight on the beaches, Darkest Hour lets the audience witness how Britain's leaders reacted to such a major battle. Seeing both together allows the viewer to see both a first and secondhand account of one of the biggest points of conflict in human history.With experience in period piece films such as Atonement and Pride & Prejudice, director Joe Wright expertly knows how to stage and execute a film with lots of dialogue and grand sets. Most times we are literally following behind Churchill as the camera travels with him. We see his journey from his home, Parliament, and Buckingham Palace. It is all impressively done and superbly showcases the grandness of London in such dreary times.There is also a wonderful score from Dario Marianelli that mixes both booming and soft orchestral music. The music usually hides in the background until just the right moment to grab your attention. A highlight is at the very end of the film when Churchill makes his famous speech.Even though he is in practically every scene of the film, Gary Oldman as Winston Churchill is so good I wish there was more of him. He perfectly captures Churchill's brutish tone and attitude but also shows his softer side when he is away from the public. Oldman also plays excellently off all his supporting cast members, most notably Kristin Scott Thomas as his wife and Ben Mendelsohn as King George VI.We also get a larger supporting role from Lily James as Churchill's assistant. When we are not following on Churchill we are focused on her character and the journey she went through being a witness t to one of history's most powerful figures. While Oldman takes command and gives us an inside look at Churchill, James holds her own by letting us see how others saw him on the outside.Any actor who wishes to play Churchill in the future will now have to live up to the unrealistically high bar Oldman has just raised. Awards will surely, and deservedly, go to him, but also should go to Bruno Delbonnel for his cinematography and Marianelli for his score. Not since Lincoln has a film done such an incredible job examining a historical figure and makes us feel like we are right in the middle of history.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Lacking & Disappointing,"One, Churchill had no lisp in his speech. I found that lisp highly distracting. And Churchill's voice was much deeper.

Other than that I found my mind wondering and thinking about other things - something I would not do if I found it engrossing.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography

A wasted opportunity,"Just about everything is wrong with this effort which in the end retains one's attention mainly because one has seen Christopher Nolan's excellent Dunkirk. 
This is supposed to be the political story behind Dunkirk. Winston Churchill was prime minister barely a month before Dunkirk happened. 
And there probably still is a great story to tell there because Darkest Hour merely throws up what is well known in an almost comic book fashion. (For a far deeper look at it - and told by people who was in the British parliament then - see the appropriate episode of the documentary World At War.) 
This movie starts out as a political biopic but halfway through loses focus and seems to become a C grade art movie with the Churchill character nervously ""losing it"" in the toilet and such other silly scenes. 
Then the fibbing also starts. It has the main character doing ""symbolic"" deeds rooted in the artistic pretensions of the movie - unfortunately things that never actually happened (the train).
Joe Wright here had one of the most dramatic set of happenings in British history for probably a century or more.... why not stick to it? 
Another matter that bothered one were the special effects like when the air journey to France was undertaken. Are the shots from the plane artistic shots that flopped or was is merely very badly made miniature props? It is unclear.
Gary Oldman plays Churchill and he makes a bit of a mess of it. Unfortunately for him one can go to YouTube and listen to Churchill's actual speeches. Oldman does not nearly get it right. Where the real Churchill sounds confident and calm Oldman's Churchill sounds scared and hysterical. 
A movie that failed because the script was second grade and it started with history and then frantically seemed to want to become an art movie of sorts.",4.0,Anonymous,Biography

"Stellar Gary Oldman, With Little Else","As so many have mentioned, this film is a one-man show supported and driven by the brilliance of Gary Oldman. His top-notch performance is worthy of the the Golden Globe for which he's nominated, and makes this film worthy of viewing. Complete with Churchill's rolling Rs, top hat, cigar, witty, biting and complex delivery, Oldman's performance is impeccable.The rest of the film takes away from Oldman's brilliance. This is a historic, biographical drama which means it must be factually accurate if it is to be taken seriously. The climatic or ""turning point"" scene when Churchill realizes Britain cannot negotiate the peace brokered by Halifax and Chamberlain but instead must continue to fight, is carried out with complete disregard for actual events and ventures into the realm of absurdity. ""Hollywood liberties"" are OK in some cases, but not in this one.The absolute ridiculousness of this scene pulls the rug out from what was a solid first half of the film, and the ending takes on an aire of what we've seen so many times before, a hero defying all odds to triumph in absolute victory.Considering Oldman's performance, this film had so much more potential than what it delivered on. Arguments between Churchill, Halifax, and Chamberlain are present, but few and far in-between. Halifax's disapproving expression does not change once during such scenes, and I'm almost positive the director found the right Stephen Dillane face, and told him to hold it for the entire duration of filming.Argumentative dialogue during a time of war is not likely to end in a witty joke, as it so often does in this film, and I would like to have seen more intense discussion about Britain and the Western World's future i.e. what is to be gained through war or peace, and what is to be lost. The pressures on Churchill were enormous, and the film presents his situation as if brokering peace and engaging in war would both have been acceptable outcomes. I understand this is not a war film, but flashbacks to what's happening on the battlefield as Parliament quarrels amongst themselves wold also have added evoked more emotion in the audience.All things considered, go watch this movie for Gary OIdman, but keep your expectations low.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
detailed film,"This movie was honestly well made, however I was not a fan of the storyline. It was long and had many assets. Despite my dislike for the plot, the film itself had all factors checked off. For example, Good acting, humor, seriousness, and design. My favorite part of this movie is probably when Churchill is informed that the ""V"", he previously held up for victory in a photo, meant ""up you're bum"". With how serious of a movie this is, you have to have SOME humor. Overall I'd give this movie a 7/10 because, while I didn't enjoy watching the movie, the skills of creating this movie met all expectations.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
"""He Has Mobilized the English Language and Sent It Into Battle""","I'm not a historical literalist when it comes to films based on historical events or characters so long as imagined scenes and events carry the drama forward and are not completely unfathomable or unfairly distort the record of historical characters (e.g., see LBJ in ""Selma""). If you want a good historical account of Churchill's first weeks as PM, read John Lukacs' ""Five Days in London: May 1940"" but if you want a vivid and visually dramatic portrayal of Churchill during this crucial time, then watch ""Darkest Hour."" I was totally absorbed in this film knowing that a British negotiated peace in May 1940 totally alters the arc of world history going forward.Gary Oldman is, of course, brilliant in his portrayal of Churchill, cigars and all, and the filmmakers did a great job recreating the House of Commons since they weren't allowed to use the real House, or at least its benches. Oldman's Churchill stammers a bit in this film which surprised me as I believed Churchill's verbal fluency was such that American diplomats marveled at his effortless eloquence at Tehran and Yalta. As for the much-maligned underground (subway) scene where the aristocrat PM solicits the opinions of common Brits on whether to fight on or not, it worked for me. In the midst of a peace movement within his war cabinet, he had to solicit the fighting mood of everyday Brits; this was an effective dramatic scene. Would you rather have the filmmakers have him reading poll results at 10 Downing Street?Another thing that makes ""Darkest Hour"" work for me is that the ""peace"" group within the war cabinet, the ""antagonists"" so to speak (specifically Chamberlain and Halifax) were given compelling arguments to counter Churchill's belligerence. They wanted to see what kind of negotiated terms Britain might get from Hitler. After all, we don't know definitively to this day why Hitler held up his panzers before Dunkirk for several days: was he getting anxious about the speed of the German advance or did he admire the British Empire so much that he could live, for a time, with its preservation?",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Great lead performance by Oldman,"""Darkest Hour"" is all about Churchill's role in guiding his country through this very perilous time. Joe Wright's film lionizes him to a great extent, although some of the great man's vulnerabilities (self-doubt, fear) and shortcomings (temper, bullheadedness, tendency to flash his secretary) are shown without varnish. I felt that the best thing about this film was Oldman's performance, and as usual, he dives deeply into the character's speech and mannerisms with perfection. Not so easy when you consider how many screen portrayals of Churchill there have been, including several in just the last decade.The rest of the movie is a bit predictable in its portrayal of these well-known events, but enjoyable enough. Of the supporting cast performances, I thought Kristin Scott Thomas did a great job as Clementine Churchill, capturing her strength, razor wit and look very well, and Ben Mendelsohn as King George VI. Stephen Dillane as Viscount Halifax was just fine, although I am weary of seeing Dillane scowl and glower through so many parts. Lily James plays Churchill's loyal stenographer, and provides a sweet, gentle foil to the thunderous orator in their scenes together. But she seems very much the same as she's been in other roles.If you are interested in Churchill or WW2 history, you may enjoy ""Darkest Hour"" very much, especially if you remember that time period (like my dad, who said he just loved this movie). It lacks dramatic action and tension to be a truly great movie, though.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

Gary Oldman Shines in the Riveting Political Drama Darkest Hour,"Gary Oldman truly shines in his Oscar-winning portrayal of Winston Churchill, capturing the immense pressure and responsibility he faced during a pivotal moment in history.

However, the film may not appeal to everyone, particularly those who aren't fond of political dramas or slower-paced narratives.

Hand it to Oldman,"Gary gets the Oscar he should have had years ago. Reading the reviews on this site has nevertheless left me at a loss for constructive words. Heavy criticism competes with praise. I agree with both. Did Oldman morph into Churchill ? Sort of, but not really. There are far too many ultra-familiar images of the man already extant everywhere, so total success is almost impossible. Apart from which the film's story itself is not exactly well told. A few days in May 1940, blighted with fiction. Interspersed with irrelevancies, like Winston's initials being on the toilet, and how he looks like all babies. Left out was Bessie Braddock being permanently ugly, but Winston being sober in the morning. Presumably his claim to being sober a.m. could not be justified, given that he is shown as starting each day with a double Scotch. This film is better than ""Braveheart"", which can be said of all cinematic histories. Lily James was very sweet.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Rating: B+,"If you enjoy my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)Joe Wright brilliantly directs this movie, using very long takes and fantastic camera control to elevate Winston Churchill's powerful speeches. However, this film is only good because Gary Oldman executes a career-best performance. I've never experienced such a magnificent display of a historical character.Technically, the movie does not fail. The editing is seamless, the cinematography and the costumes feel extremely realistic, and the subtle score provides something extra to Oldman's flawless discourses.Nevertheless, Darkest Hour falls into the genre issues and cliches. It is far too long, having in mind that there is no sort of action or excitement during the whole runtime. It is a slow-burn and unless you especially enjoy this true-story adaptation filled with repetitive talks, I consider it just above average, solely due to one of the best displays from an actor I've ever witnessed.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

"Incredible Subject, Incredible Actor Playing Him","There are many reasons to love this movie. The first is that Winston Churchill is one of the reasons the British Empire still exists, and he shaped the modern world more than you'll ever know.The next best reason to watch this - just in case you're not interested in this subject - is to watch one of the most gifted actors of our time perfectly play this man. What's amazing about Oldman isn't just that he takes on a different look in his films. He can also completely change his voice to match the character. Watch 1992's Dracula and then this side-by-side and tell me this is the same person playing both characters.Oldman is one of the few actors I've seen who seems to become possessed by the character they're playing, whether it's a fictional character like Dracula or a real man like Churchill.It was an honor to watch this movie and this once in a generation talent.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

Decent,"This movie can be interesting to historians, and such, but I am not one. I think a lot of this movie had really beautifully and artfully crafted shots and transitions, and it was coherent enough through our protagonist who himself was very much not. I would suggest subtitles, because a lot of the music, which is quite good for this film, can be loud and the voices not. Of course Churchill's slurring is his character - a drunk man who somehow runs a country during wartime - but you truly don't understand anything unless you have those subtitles. The pacing in some parts was alright, though a lot of the time it felt fast, and it was the best when things suddenly slowed down. Some scenes felt a little out of place sometimes, but they didn't completely ruin the movie. Biopics can be great or not, there's a fine line between how they portray the character of the person and the events of their life. I think they did well with a more realistic approach to who Churchill actually was, but it still felt a little dull in places to me.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
If only the film was as good as Oldman's acting,"It's hard to believe the same guy was Sid Vicious in 1986, and Winston Churchill in 2017. 'Darkest Hour' really is the Gary Oldman showcase film. His performance is well deserving of the Best Actor Academy Award. I just wish the film had been as consistent and free-flowing as Oldman's acting.The more I learn about Churchill, the less I seem to like about him. This film is no exception. It definitely portrays Winston as quite an incapable Prime Minister at times - which further illustrated what I have been reading lately.The film felt a bit disjointed at times, though picked up toward the end. It was hard not to get a bit angry or frustrated towards the politicians being incapable of anything but infighting among themselves. It's definitely a ""yelling film"", which grew tiresome. Lots of yelling. Which if not for Gary Oldman, I'd say gets all too often confused for ""strong dramatic acting"". Though a shout out should also go to Ben Mendelsohn's excellent support performance as King George VI.My heart definitely went out to the brave soldiers whose lives were in the front-lines, while these muffins sat puffing cigars at desks.Oldman delivered strong renditions of Churchill's famous speeches, though it was the London Underground scene which was by far the highlight of the film for me. Churchill's also not short of quotable lines either:""Success is not final, failure is not fatal: it is the courage to continue that counts.""",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Interesting Historical Piece,"Historical films have always been a soft spot for me, and Darkest Hour is no exception. The story of Winston Churchill and his promotion to Prime Minister of England during World War II, this film lets you see Churchill struggle and succeed. I enjoyed seeing the British political side of the war, and learned a lot about Churchill and how the English government handled WWII. I was captivated the entire time; the story even became inspiring towards the end. I found this film to be complementary to Dunkirk, it included the same period, only the political side of the story. This film added to my understanding of Dunkirk as a whole.I also thought that Gary Oldman's performance was grand. His delivery as Churchill was captivating, and you could tell that he was dedicated to nailing the performance. The makeup team also did an unbelievable job transforming Oldman and definitely deserves the best makeup award. As for the films negatives, I think the film did not excel at thinking outside the box; it was similar to other historical film biopics I have seen.

Darkest Hour,"In reviewing Darkest Hour, I find it extremely difficult to write this review without making comparisons to this year's other film about Winston Churchill, simply titled, Churchill, starring Brian Cox in the leading role. The two different films have areas where sometimes they compliment each other and at other times it is as if they could not be any further distant, or opposite from one another. This same thing happened when back in 2005 you had Bennett Miller's film version of Capote come out telling the true story of writer and social figure, Truman Capote as he researches and writes his most famous book, In Cold Blood. The film was a smash with critics and was nominated for several Academy Awards including winning the late Phillip Seymour Hoffman the Best Actor Award for his uncanny and terrifically spot on portrayal of Capote. About a year, or possibly even less than that you had Infamous come out which starred Toby Jones as Truman Capote this time and yet still was about him conducting the interviews and even befriending one of the inmates on death role for the crime he committed which would later result in Capote's best selling book, In Cold Blood. I never saw the version with Toby Jones entitled, Infamous, but I remember one critic on television saying that of the two versions, Infamous was the one he preferred even though it got neither the awards, or media coverage that the earlier Seymour Hoffman film did. Is this always nescessary to have two films about a certain event, or person coming out in such short time apart from one another? And yet as I saw Churchill back in the Summer, and am now have seen Darkest Hour, in the days following Christmas, I have to make a distinction about which film is the better of the two and also which one I liked better in my opinion and I will go against popular opinion here and say that I actually preferred the Brian Cox film better for reasons which I will now elaborate on. The Brian Cox version of Churchill, I found to be not as technically polished, or shall I say that it did not come near as having the same financial backing, or behind the scenes talent that Darkest Hour did. You can tell right away that Churchill was more of an independent production whereas Darkest Hour probably cost a fair bit to make and of the two, Darkest Hour trumps it in terms of visual flare having what I consider to be some of the best cinematography, lighting and period piece attention to detail of any film I have seen this year. How the crew of Darkest Hour can set a tone and a mood just simply by it's lighting, or use of objects whether numerous, or few in a room was quite respectably and admirably done. The film was gorgeous to look at even though at times some of the scenes it was capturing were bleak, or the furthest thing you can think of away from the word 'gorgeous'. Also of the two performances, both were good, but Gary Oldman as Churchill in Darkest Hour, wins the prize here just as he most likely will on Oscar night as well. Everything from the miraculous make up and hair transformation of Gary Oldman into Churchill to his ravenous and empowered performance is the stuff that Oscar voters go for and truth be told it was an excellent performance. Brian Cox's performance used little to no makeup and yet while still a good performance on it's own merits, Gary Oldman's will be the one that is remembered. In terms of film structure and composition, Darkest Hour also overtakes the earlier film and you can tell that a much more experienced team worked behind it and they achieved what they set out to do and then some. So if Darkest Hour is visually a better film as well as technically structured better and has a better performance, why do I go with what is obviously the underdog between the two? I think more than anything it comes down to the fact that I overall found Churchill more of a pleasurable viewing experience and I was not only engrossed, but also fascinated by it's subject matter and for a fan of history as well as politics it was a satisfying night out at the movies. Darkest Hour on the other hand often to me felt very dry and at times it bordered on even being a bit slow, or dare I use the word 'boring'? It wasn't nearly as exciting, or as engrossing as the earlier film and I felt it also lacked emotion whereas it looked great, but there seemed lack of empathy at times and I do not think we got to know Churchill as well as we did in the earlier film where it often focused on his deteriorating health and on the rocks marriage as well. Darkest Hour feels more like a history lesson out of a really academic text book which is informative, but makes for a dull and dreary study session. Still both films have their merits, but of the two I have made my choice which I prefer and I am sticking by it. I am probably in the minority with my opinion kind of like that sole reviewer who preferred Infamous, to it's more awarded and decorated Capote, but in this case sometimes smaller is better and more effective.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Never Surrender,"One of the most outstanding English filmmakers of the X generation, is undoubtedly Joe Wright, who since childhood shows artistic inclinations in painting, theater, TV and finally in 2005 presents his first feature film Pride & Prejudice, achieving a pleasant impression on the public and critics, then among others: Atonement 2007, Anna Karenina 2012 and her most recent film Darkest Hour in 2017.
The film is set in London exactly 80 years ago in May 1940, when the Nazis advanced uncontrollably in Europe and the English government for that reason, faced a political crisis, which ended in the rise of Winston Churchill, as Prime Minister, to the same time that other political rivals pressed for peace to be signed with Germany and thus overthrow Churchill. Aside from Oldman's affinity for the character of Winston (he studied it for a year) and Wright's touch to show the 'phlegm' and behavior of the English and their leaders, the strength of the film lies in the closeness of history with what happened in reality, regarding Churchill's conviction not to surrender against tyranny, to defend their land, their ideas and their freedom, then facing his political rivals he says: ""Nations which go down fighting rise again, and those that surrender tamely are finished"" A decisive moment in the history of the world -as we know it- that meant a great sacrifice, pain and loss of life for the English families, but that in the end with the victory, it was demonstrated that their leader was right not to give up, in another great phrase says to his critics: ""You can not reason with a tiger when your head is in its mouth"" A renowned orator and iconic politician, he had to earn the respect of the king as well as his entire people in order to rule.

Oldman's Performance Alone is Worth Your Time...,"Set in the year 1940, the future of Western Europe is in the hands of a new Prime Minister. As the new Prime Minister, Winston Churchill, is announced, he will be required to make some of the most difficult choices in history, such as questioning if it is indeed wise to negotiate for peace with Adolf Hitler, or bring the fight straight to him...Needless to say, the choices that rest on Winston Churchill could in fact lead the end of Western Europe.This film is based on a true story.Winston Churchill is acted by Gary Oldman, who received an Academy Award for best male actor for his work in this film. Within a short duration of this film, I can understand why. From the very get go, we discover that Churchill and his capabilities as a suitable Prime Minister are doubted. We also know that Churchill is a man who has a heart to do what is right for the good of his country and the world.Darkest Hour for the duration is shot well and looks dark and feels gritty. For a dramatic film, we have many scenes shot underground or in dull rooms and I overall enjoyed the style to suit the film's tension and ""Dark Times"". Even as a drama, I was surprised to see how many moments Winston Churchill (Gary Oldman) as a character would also bring some slight touch humour to screen. This mostly comes from his working relationship with his new stenographer.Overall, Darkest Hour is a fantastic war film without the explosions and gun fire. The film is loaded with tension, suspense but also managed to bring some smiles, which is to the credit of the award winning performance from Gary Oldman. Needless to say, this film comes recommend just to witness Gary Oldman's performance alone.8.1/10

Great drama about history inspired fiction,"This is a movie about how Churchill comes to power and gathers the support of the people. The story itself is not that interesting, especially if you already know history. It starts boringly slow, continues in tense hopelessness, and ends with grandiose unity, complete in pathos. In the middle it does a great job demonstrating how hard it is to make decisions that change thousands of lives and in a way, the course of history especially when you don't know whats next. At the end it takes up speed and becomes really enjoyable with all the emotionally epic moments where everything starts to get together. It is a great drama with sentimental moments about leadership, unity, and the willingness to fight for survival. Unfortunately most of it is fiction, at least in the exact specifics it is portrayal. It is inspired by history but, what we see in the movie is definitely not how it happened, especially the parts that didn't happen at all. The infamous subway scene was a truly touching moment, too good to be true. Well, because it isn't.Gary Oldman's performance is superb. He deserved the Oscar for it. The way he brought Churchill to the screen is the biggest positive about this film. He delivered the speeches with the impact of a true rhetorician which makes these scenes the best in the movie. Lily James on the other hand is hard to even mention. She was there... She typed more words then she said. Her charater had no relevance in the story.Picture is well done. Set design, costumes, lighting is great. They did artistic compositions and techniques that conveye a message symbolically which made this piece visually appealing. CGI was especially good.

Gary Oldman,"This story is well know, and well enough told in this film. That said, Oldman's performance as Chircillis perfect.

Historically accurate,"This movie is a historically accurate depiction of the early days of World War II from the perspective of then-prime minister Winston Churchill.The pacing of the movie is a little bit inconsistent; in the sense that the first 40 minutes or so were rather boring. The pacing was just too slow and not much was happening. I almost lost interest but then the movie started to shine with it's performances and the pacing adjusted itself accordingly. It was a pleasant surprise that totally changed everything.Gary Oldman is a seasoned actor so his performance as Winston Churchill was understandably thrilling. But even though he was ""unrecognizable"" in the movie, thanks to the great make-up artistry, he still didn't quite end up looking like Winston Churchill, in my humble opinion. Winston Churchill had those big friendly-looking eyes. You just can't imitate that with make-up.The calendar date overlay transitions were a really nice touch. They keep the viewer in the loop and provide a frame of reference. That way viewers are able to develop a good understanding of the time frame in which the events ensue. 
It works rather well with the format of the movie. Sure, it may seem a little gimmicky at first (that's at least what I thought when I first saw that transition) but it turns out to suit the movie quite well.Quick synopsis:
Churchill is underplaying the threat that Germany is posing until things start going south. In order to avoid a total FUBAR in Dunkirk he tries an unconventional strategic move to ""bring the boys home"".Viscount Halifax tries to undermine Churchill's authority by asking him tough questions concerning the principle of peace. He believes that Churchill's stubbornness may worsen the already problematic situation.
While it may seem like Halifax is the ""bad guy"" he's really just trying to do the right thing for the British people, just like Churchill. But both clash throughout the entirety of the movie because they have different perspectives. 
Halifax is the typical diplomat while Churchill is more of a ""Britain first"" type of person. Churchill considered Hitler too great of a threat to be reasoned with.Most of the action happens in the war cabinet. And with Halifax as the opposing force to Churchill things get heated every now and then. Halifax believes that Europe is lost to the Germans and tries to play it safe by means of negotiation.
Churchill on the other hand wants to ""fight"" until the very end. Being certain that negotiating with the Germans would be useless. Churchill is unapologetic and comes off as rude most of the time, but he has his heart in the right place.Churchill's relationship with the King was very interesting and nuanced. It was one of the main themes that was gradually explored during the movie. Which kind of makes sense; as the prime minister you are obligated to meet with the King/Queen once per week. It was therefore executed in a very thoughtful manner.Side note: if you plan on watching ""Dunkirk"" you should probably watch this movie first. You'll thank me later. Those two movies perfectly compliment each other and should be watched together in the aforementioned order.To conclude: It was a great movie. If it wasn't for the slow pacing at the beginning I would have given it a slightly higher rating.Final verdict: recommended (if you like historical biopics)",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Go Gary!,"Of course it was a magnificent performance from the always great Gary Oldman. I think we always knew it was going to be the case. From the trailers and from a long history of fine performances from the man.It was easy to forget it was actually him with all the blubber around his jowls, taking on the doubters all around him as he tries desperately to find a way to lift the mood of the nation with the mighty German army about to push the last of the British troops into the sea on the northern coast of France.It was almost a behind-the-scenes sequel to the movie Dunkirk as we work towards the civilian fleet sailing off across The Channel to pick up the stranded soldiers.And thanks for the help America!They certainly build the mood nicely as we feel the pressure mounting on Mr Winston, who has to make some pretty tough decisions with a war cabinet pressing for a peace deal with Hitler.""YOU CANNOT REASON WITH A TIGER WHEN YOUR HEAD IS IN ITS MOUTH!"", he screams at Chamberlain and Halifax.Given my knowledge of the big cat family, I'm not sure you can reason with a tiger at any time actually. But then again, maybe with a nice juicy steak. Hitler of course was a famous vegetarian, so I don't think a 12oz ribeye would do the trick.Of course there were some fine performances from the supporting cast too. Ducky from Four Weddings was superb in her part as Mrs Churchill, as well as Aussie Ben Mendelson in his role as the King.I do have to wonder if anybody in the 1940's could actually pronounce their R's properly. Or should I say 'pwoperly'. Many of the characters seemed to suffer from this.It was also interesting to see the internal anguish that Winston was going through after being thrown in at the deep end. Because of course, we all know how it all turned out so it's easy to forget just how hard those tough decisions of sending men to certain death must have been for a man trying to save a nation.But thanks to a scene with Winston talking to the the real people on the ground, or rather Underground, it was made clear that the British people would rather die than bow down to fascists.Upon looking up whether this situation actually took place, it appears it didn't, but rather was put in for dramatic effect. However, it very well could have in a different way given Mr Churchill's tendency to go missing on occasion and apparently often to go talking to your every day person on the street. Either way, it was a fantastic scene that summed up the resolve of the British people at a very dark time.Mr Oldman must surely be up for an award, if not the top award for his portrayal of the man who refused to bow down to tyranny marching its way across Europe.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Not dark enough,"Darkest HourI wonder if anyone's heard anything about that story before. Is it real? Yes? How real is it? Does it matter? Pretty much everything in the film is overshadowed by the performance of the majesty that is Gary Oldman. So much so that it's even nominated for the Oscar Award in Best Achievement in Cinematography, though it has its fair share of ""mishaps"". Anyway. Back to the screenplay, which, once again, as it's a ""based on"" production, takes perhaps certain liberties that are somewhat difficult to swallow in the form of inane scenes and moments that would be (are) cringe worthy if not for the great acting.Oldman is spectacular and like some have said - it's a one man show. Which it's true. Not to lessen others, well established members of the cast, who are also great, but it just goes to show the magnitude of Oldman's performance and pretty much just because of that, it's a film worth watching.All in all, the general set design, costumes and make up are to be praised. However, the camera work is way over the top at times and goes overboard with the extravagant behaviour. Unnecessarily so. It did not help the storytelling, if anything, it diminished it and the general effort put in the rest of the film's CGI budget. Definitely not something worth giving an Oscar for.Directing wise, if you've seen Joe Wright's earlier work, you pretty much know what you can expect. He does a decent job, but it rarely touches the ceiling. And though Darkest Hour is enjoyable for the most part, the aforementioned issues cripple the story. It seems like director himself was on the point were he had to choose and unfortunately he chose to give in. Perhaps it makes the story more cinematic. One could argue. But it definitely didn't make it dark enough.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Yawntastic historical rewrite,"Winston Churchill was a total hawk and not a hero as many people believe. Most of the things he did killed innocent soldiers with ill-advised war strategies. He was also a pompous git. He never asked ordinary people what they thought on the 'tube' during the war, he was an elitist buffoon. He simply got lucky and was by chance the right man at the time during the early 1940's.Also Gary Oldman is not a genius actor, Churchill is about the easiest person to play in the world, be grumpy, grunt and smoke cigars, almost anyone could have done it. The makeup was competent but nothing special.All in all this wasn't even a patch on the also massively overrated Dunkirk. Darkest Hour was boring, nationalistic history rewrite of history. If you have any dignity avoid at all costs. If you are some Brexit loving gibbon this film might appeal to your jingoistic stupidity.",1.0,Anonymous,Biography

Up Your Bum,I was not expecting to like this movie. When it comes to war tales I typically lean more towards the action side. Political movies typically bore me but this one did not. I found Churchill hilarious and his character quickly grew on me. He was a super goofy old dude and i would trust him with my life. He reminds me of my grandpa and I can appreciate that. I don't know much about the real Churchill but this fictional one was awesome and i liked him a lot. I really enjoyed the soundtrack as well and this film had some crazy cool shots and transitions.

I give this movie 10 out of 10 in so many categories, but only 8 out of 10 as an overall rating. It's not my cup of tea, but it's still so great.

a man vs the world,"One man vs everything. Darkest hour portraits a time in history where everything seemed to be lost and no idea seemed good. It´s an interesting movie where you just see more and more things pile on a pure man who has been giving his position at the worst possible time. Churchill is portraited phenomenally by Gary Oldman who really disappears into his role. While I think this movie played it safe for the most parts, it drags on a bit too long and has one of those biopic moments that really takes you out of it.We follow Winston Churchill after becoming prime minister during the second world war. Churchill is feeling pressure from all sides and must navigate a time in history where no choices seem correct.What carries this movie is it´s amazing performance by Gary Oldman and the interesting point in time shown. It´s an interesting story with so much internal drama the external drama can feel like it´s only the backdrop of the movie, when in reality it´s what everything was about. Churchill most not only think about nazi Germany and his allies and soldiers, but also about being removed as prime minister by nearly everyone. It´s the classic underdog story where it´s everyone against one and you feel the pressure and dilemmas Churchill was under.The other really good aspect about this movie is Gary Oldman´s performance. This might be one of his best roles and a real stand out performance where Oldman disappears into the role fully. The amazing makeup job helps no doubt. Oldman makes Churchill this lovable character that's charming, but slowly we see his decent as more and more troubles arise. This is an outstanding performance on so many levels and no doubt the best part of the movie. He captures the speech power of Churchill and translate iconic historical moments into hard hitting movie scenes. Churchill was both a great speaker and a funny charming man and Oldman fluctuate between the two perfectly.Oldman sounds a bit like Droppy sometimes. That's all.The score is really good. The intense piano really hit me most times and together with the camera it can do wonders in this movie.The cinematography was hit or miss for me. It either creates really beautiful frames or it´s too pretentious. I was either nodding in approval or rolling my eyes. It´s the more understated scenes with blocking and shadow work that looked good to me, and the slowmo and crane shots that was too much. It´s a mixed bag.The movie sadly drags on a bit too long. The movie is about being in charge in bad times and not much else. And when that has sink in the movie is not much more. I could feel my disinterest as the last 15 minutes were coming up. Maybe you can stick through it all, but I had a hard time keeping the same level of interest throughout. The movie also falls into some classic biopic tropes with Churchill being portrait as nearly always right and especially towards the end he gets to be a bit too heroy. Maybe things happened like this, but it just seemed so written compared to the more grounded movie I had been watching.Overall I liked darkest hour. I found the acting amazing, especially from Oldman and the historical events interesting. The movie has a lot of good elements but towards the end the movie magic dies down a bit and the movie becomes more see-through. It´s an overall good movie though.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
the finest film ever made about the Churchill legend,"In the wake of several high-profile films about Britain's greatest leader, is there anything more to know about Winston Churchill? The archives of history attest to the unique stature of this political figure: more remarkable is the surrounding folklore that has shaped British and world history. It is at this level that Darkest Hour (2017) is perhaps the finest film ever made about the Churchill legend.The dialogue-dense plotline is tightly compressed yet massive in the scale of its largely unseen off-screen action. Set In the critical weeks of May to June 1940, Winston Churchill (Gary Oldman) emerges as the least objectionable candidate to become Prime Minister after the British Parliament loses confidence in Neville Chamberlain. As the film Dunkirk (2017) so graphically shows, the Nazis had cornered almost the entire British army at Dunkirk and their total destruction was imminent. It was the definitive turning point of World War II: Churchill must inform Parliament that if the British forces are wiped out in France, it may not be long before a swastika will fly from Buckingham Palace. Belgium, France and Holland are entering surrender negotiations and a political group still loyal to Chamberlain are urging that Britain use Mussolini as an intermediary to secure favourable terms for a British surrender. Churchill must weigh the saving of countless young lives if Britain surrenders against the loss of nationhood and life under Nazi rule. As history records, Churchill rejects appeasement and his speeches to the British nation declaring that ""we shall never surrender"" are still regarded as among the finest ever made.It needs to be said that Darkest Hour does not add to, nor subtract from, what we know of these historical events: it's power lies entirely in Gary Oldman's tour-de-force performance. More psychological thriller than bio-pic, the plotline advances with electrifying gravity, painfully pausing to amplify the enormity of impending national doom. Oldman executes a brilliant screenplay with eloquence, belligerence, and a gifted gravel-voiced orator's 'call-to-arms' like the world has never seen. As we saw in Churchill (2017), this is a profoundly mortal, flawed, and emotionally vulnerable leader: Oldman is simply brilliant in portraying the knife-edge balancing of two fateful options, both of which would shape the course of modern history like no other single event: surrender or risk annihilation. When President Roosevelt declined his personal call for assistance, it was indeed Britain's darkest hour.This film comes close to being flawless but for one scene that lingers with an air of compromised plausibility. With a Parliamentary speech about to be given, Churchill bolts from a rear car seat and into the London Tube. He enters a carriage full of ordinary citizens and soon has an audience of astonished gazes which become a single chorus urging Churchill to never surrender. Despite the rousing sentiment, the scene plays like a dream sequence from another movie. Perhaps this is trivial in light of what this excellent film achieves: a portrait of a leader who had the weight of the world on his shoulders and the courage to be guided by his uncompromising belief in the British people. As today's British and American leaders offer more walls and less leadership, Darkest Hour is a reminder of what leadership actually means.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

Delivers everything you want from a prestige historical biopic,"As prestige pictures go, they don't get more prestigious than ""Darkest Hour,"" a British historical World War II biopic about one of the most frequently quoted and depicted figures in history with a transformative performance at its center. If you want the antithesis of independent filmmaking, here it is - the steak and potatoes of dramatic cinema.Thankfully, the steak is a perfect medium and the potatoes are well-seasoned under the watch of director Joe Wright (""Atonement,"" ""Anna Karenina""). Wright is known for being a bit artistically aggressive rather than subtle, but that style complements the highly intellectual, conversational and strategy-focused script from Anthony McCarten (""The Theory of Everything""). He takes a film that could've been utterly boring and gives it movement and vibrancy.""Darkest Hour"" depicts the events of May 1940, starting with the stepping down of British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain (Ronald Pickup) and the appointment of Winston Churchill (Gary Oldman), the only member of his party whom the opposition would support. The move comes as British forces are surrounded by the Nazis in Dunkirk, France and the war seems just about lost. Although Churchill stands resolute against his party's wishes to entered peace negotiations with Hitler, the situation grows more dire by the day, and the pressure mounts for him to cave.An almost unrecognizable Oldman is the film's centerpiece and lynchpin all in one. Unlike many prosthetics-laden performances, the makeup is so painstakingly and precisely applied that it never calls attention to itself and allows Oldman to full realize his interpretation of Churchill. Oldman gives us both the bold and bullish, cigar-smoking and liquor-swilling orator of historic lore, and also a man with doubts. The script definitely casts Churchill in a favorable light, and perhaps historians will take issue with it, but there's plenty of room for nuance and Oldman really revels in those moments as much if not more than the big speeches.Oldman's performance is the sun, but some of the other supporting players in his orbit leave memorable impressions, including Stephen Dillane (""Game of Thrones"") as Viscount Halifax, Kristin Scott Thomas as Clemmie and Ben Mendelsohn (""Rogue One"") as King George VI. Still, without shoehorning in Churchill's typist (Lily James) whom he technically did not employ until 1941, ""Darkest Hour"" would be a lot of white men talking.Wright does a lot to keep ""Darkest Hour"" visually engaging, be it through use of camera dollies in tight spaces or CGI aerial views of cities and towns to convey a sense of place when talk of strategy desensitizes us from the actual stakes. Still, the film is meant to explore the behind-the-scenes conversations in places of power and convey the extent to which Great Britain nearly gave up. While the whole country was swept up in rhetoric of hope, the film makes us privy to the fear and weakness behind the curtain.""Darkest Hour"" as a film caves a bit too - to storytelling devices all too familiar in prestige pictures. The script contrives unlikely scenarios, such as a scene when Churchill rides the Underground, and even attempts to conclude on an inspirational high note with a sweeping speech. The film is better than those crutches, yet nevertheless it uses them.Yet ""Darkest Hour"" can also hang its top hat on incredible production design (Sarah Greenwood, Katie Spencer) and cinematography (Bruno Delbonnel). These aesthetics alone, especially as they bolster Oldman's unforgettable performance, imbue the film with an energy that commands our attention. For an old-fashioned historical biopic, ""Darkest Hour"" checks all the right boxes and flat-out delivers on that esteemed, high-brow entertainment.~Steven CThanks for reading!

Gary Oldman's finest hours,"It is as if Gary Oldman was born to play Winston Churchill. I think 3 Oscars for DDL is enough. Another role like this will unlikely come Oldman's way - he has waited almost a lifetime for it to begin with. Gary Oldman literally transformed himself to become Churchill. It is the best performance of the year by far, especially considering Oldman's very wide range of acting capability. He is one of the most versatile actors in Hollywood. As good as DDL is, Gary Oldman has zero oscars for his many amazing performances. In the Darkest Hour, in my opinion, it is without a doubt Oldman's greatest performance. The movie is tense, gripping, entertaining, and at many times comic, mainly due to the perfect behaviour and mannerisms of Oldman as Churchill. Some will not like it because it's 'boring', but it is ultimately a retelling of historical events, and there is only so much room for 'entertainment' in such a category of work. It is more a dramatic depiction of Churchill and the politics of war, rather than an 'action' piece, and it is the humour, will and determination of Oldman as Churchill that makes this movie truly worthwhile. Highly recommended if you're in the mood for this type of a film.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

"Admirable, vastly entertaining","The problem with any film about Winston Churchill (let alone WWII) is the subject is too complex for one film. However, Darkest Hour does make a very entertaining stab at it for the period when Churchill has just become Prime Minister.Many other films have used 'artistic license' as an excuse for lazy script writing where they blatantly ignore historical facts, or down right lie. Then have the gall to announce 'based on a true story' which is just code for B.S.Darkest Hour uses 'artistic license' as it should be used, i.e. to help tell the story (not re-write history) e.g. It shows Churchill making a fictious tube journey to 'ask the people'. This is artistic license as a way of portraying that Churchill's views did represent the will of the country at that time. (which he did)Whilst any film on Churchill is going to be contentious, I found this film extremely entertaining, showing some of the 'Great Man's' many quirks, flaws, greatnesses and weaknesses. I particularly like the fact it showed how close England was to making peace (at almost any cost)We can all look back with the wisdom of hindsight now, and know Churchill was right, but at the time Britain was staring into the abyss of facism and was alone.I have only 2 criticisms of the film1.The King's 'stutter' was portrayed as an 'W' pronouncer 'woger' (roger) and came across as similar to Kripkey character from Big Bang Theory and was a little irritating. However as the film progressed the actor reduced this dramatically.2. After 2 hours the film finished.

"An interesting pair for ""Dunkirk""","The best acting always includes the best yelling, and Gary Oldman does some of the best WWII yelling since Bruno Ganz in Downfall or George C. Scott from Patton. In fact, that would have been a great movie, Oldman, Ganz, and Scott yelling at each other about everything or nothing at all, trapped in a bunker for two hours or more.Darkest Hour shows us a Winston Churchill who mumbles and bumbles and stumbles through the weeks of the Battle of Dunkirk, when there was no steady coalition in the British Parliament to pursue a course of non-capitulation, and a dying Neville Chamberlain seeking to appease Hitler one last time. Catching Darkest Hour in close temporal proximity to Dunkirk is an interesting movie pairing, one getting shelled at on the beaches of Dunkirk, another getting yelled at in the basements of London.Oldman shuffles around with neck popped down and eyes popped up over thick glasses, like a turtle or overfed goose, smacking a cigar and drinking champagne as if always on holiday.

I tried to watch it through on three separate occasions in the theatre -- the last mid-day and after substantial amounts of coffee, which finally allowed me to get through it.Skipping past any small blunders in the historical details, and with no visible ""crackle"" between Churchill and Eden (I mean COME ON! that at least should have been properly managed) the focus is on the one expression, ""bugger on,"" and portrays a cantankerous and inept PM.Will the movie be nominated for awards?

Gary Oldman's role of a lifetime.,"Critics can say what they want about this movie. Some praised it; some panned it. For myself, I make up my own mind. In this instance, those who panned this were dead wrong. Not only is this an amazing movie from an entertainment standpoint, it is filled with some of the absolute best performances by a cast I have seen in a long time. The Brits have once again shown our Hollywood egotistical dames, dans and over glorified snowflakes what it is to perfect the craft of ACTING. Oldman is nothing short of amazing. He totally becomes Churchill. It is as if we have all been allowed to glimpse once again what took place some 70 years ago as if it happened yesterday. Recent films from the Brits, such as ""Dunkirk"", the Branaugh re-make of ""Murder on the Orient Expresss"" and now ""Darkest Hour,"" continue to reaffirm over and over what true talent is and that, sadly, in America, Hollywood - for the most part - has missed the boat on every level. Those true American actors who appeared in ""Murder"" were elevated by Branaugh's genius to their best performances. Most of our American actors pale by comparison. I have become an avid fan of all British entertainment. Hollywood loses, and deservedly so.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

But come on guys, that's all about it. I even got a little bored towards the end of movie. I think some people take it too seriously. Maybe they are craving for a national hero.

The events Britain faced in 1940 are honestly depicted and not one compromise is given away to the sensationalist.I think this is a great film, but it may take time to be accepted as one of the best war films ever made.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
I'm no historian but...,"Just to rebuke all the historian slanted reviews talking about the many documenteries they watched.The Dunkirk situation seemed pretty accurate from start to evacuation. The movie acknowledged that the brits couldnt provide real air cover and they also had scenes where the air marshall recommend not risking planes. That Chamberlain was a peacemonger and was blind because of this, this too me is accurate. The speeches where correctly delivered both in content and timeline from what I can tell.Oldman's acting was well above his average and excellent/unimaginable for 99% of other actors.If you are looking for action then this is not the show. But it is very well done, the sets are very period, and it is full of content to suck in.Not sure this deserves a 7? Especially where the new star wars movies get in the eights.

Behind the WWII with Churchill,"Winston Churchill, who is played by Gary Oldman, had to direct England while the Nazis were about to invade it.
Even if the population and the King was against his election for being the new Prime Minister, Winston kept belive in him, with the support of his wife.
And it's with his strong determination that he protected England and his whole population.I think that even when you're not a hitory film fan, you have to watch this incredible film which explain lot of things that we don't necessarily know about the WWII.

Gary Oldman is the main attraction and the bait,"I actually only go through three-quarter of this movie, I've decided this is way too dull. I've been reading some article about Oscar-baiting movies. This is definitely one of them. I'm not saying the movie is so bad, but I think, movie is an art, not a money-making machine. Right? Check up reviews and critics, they praise Gary's acting. Gary is the bait, right? I myself watch this movie because of him. His body transformation is unbelivable (but exaggertaed) and his mimicking, gesture, timbre is unique and need a lot of real work to achieve that level of acting. Talking about best actor, we could compare Oldman and Day-Lewis. Daniel had also played in Lincoln (2012) with similar role. Daniel is a lot more charismathic than Gary. Churcill wasn't a very likeable, either, like the one Gary played in this. Because this movie is all about Gary Oldman, and not Churcill, I think I'm going to end my review.

Brought contrivance to a whole new level,"I'd put off watching this film. I've a bit of a problem with theatrical reconstructions portrayed as fact. What is true and what is made up for dramatic effect? If you don't know the subject matter you simply don't know. Why let truth get in the way when you have a product (film) to sell?Having watched Darkest Hour, I'm none the wiser (my history is poor). As is often the case with these sorts of biopic films, I found myself wanting to watch a documentary.The main body of the film was okay. But I found it annoying - why did Churchill have to make the privy joke, for example.... ""I can only take one s**t at a time."" This was one of quite a few examples which I felt was overly contrived, perhaps to make the film more accessible. I could accept that if it was a totally fictional story, but it wasn't..But worse - a LOT worse was to come. Why did Churchill get the tube? I might be wrong but I'm pretty sure that didn't happen. Regardless, he says when on the train ""have you never seen a prime minister on the underground before""? He then suddenly becomes humble and a 'man of the people' - so out of context and character to what the man was all about. Why? He then asks his adoring fellow travellers about the prospective peace deal with Hitler..... They reply ""Never! Never!"" Not a single descenter (no pacifists allowed on the train clearly). So he takes zero notice of his advisers, and 100% notice of the people on the train who apparently support his view - including a token black man he pats on the hand (I understand he was a known racist - if so, why change history?) AND THEN HE CRIED. WTF? He gets off at Westminster (a long time for one stop) and not a single person on the train gets off at that stop. Have you ever known a packed train and no-one gets off? Social realism it is not.The film brought contrivance to a whole new level. I hated it - but I can't take anything away from Gary Oldman who was brilliant throughout, hence a score of 3 rather than the minimum, which the film (if not Oldman) deserved.",3.0,Anonymous,Biography

"A masterclass in filmmaking. Awesome, rousing, and unexpectedly moving.","This film is a masterpiece in every respect, and I say that with a certain amount of surprise since it is the first of Joe Wright's films that I have liked unequivocally. I've not seen them all, but those that I have seen have always left me disappointed and frustrated. Not this time.I went into DARKEST HOUR with high hopes and modest expectations. I hadn't seen any clips, but I'd seen pictures of Gary Oldman's prosthetics, and thought he looked a pretty decent Churchill, and of course the Oscar buzz was unavoidable. But nothing could prepare me for the superlative experience I've just had watching this extraordinary display of talent.The Churchill prosthetics are far better than the pictures had led me to believe. Perfect in every detail, and without a single visible flaw - even in extreme close-up. And Oldman's performance was easily the finest of his career; a powerhouse tour de force which at several points left me breathless and deeply moved. It is no surprise that both Oldman and Lucy Sibbick won Oscars for Best Actor and Best Makeup respectively. Oldman also scooped the Best Actor awards from BAFTA, SAG, and the Golden Globes.The rest of the cast, a generous scattering of veteran British talent, acquit themselves admirably and mostly hold their own when sharing screen time with Oldman. But his mesmerising, electric presence is all-consuming.The screenplay is pitch-perfect, drawing copiously and unavoidably from Churchill's recorded words, with fine structuring and a strong sense of controlled crescendo; the narrative is compelling, dramatic and fraught, with a few scattered moments of levity and some nice scenes of doubt and introspection. But everything leads inevitably and inexorably to the climactic ""we shall fight them on the beaches..."" speech, which I found infinitely more powerful and moving than the real thing, thanks to the subtle emotional manipulation that I'd willingly undergone throughout the preceding couple of hours.Which brings me to the direction.I used to know Joe Wright. We played together as kids. His parents and mine were friends, and I spent many happy days of my childhood at their family business - a puppet theatre in Islington, London, where his mum used to keep me occupied for hours at a time while my mum and Joe's dad were working on recordings for the puppet shows. It was a blissful period of my life. So when I first noticed Joe's sudden and impressive rise as a movie director, I was very excited to see his work. But despite my best intentions, I just didn't enjoy his films. Some of them were very good, and they certainly impressed most other people. But I always had niggles about one thing or another, and just couldn't settle in to them.Until now.Wow! In Darkest Hour, Joe Wright has created a cinematic vision that is every bit as stunning as I had hoped. And more. It is a visual treat, with truly outstanding cinematography, and I've already expressed myself about Mr Oldman! In this film, I totally felt Joe's presence, stomping purposefully and, yes, even aggressively, through each scene, personified in Oldman's portrayal of Winston Churchill. I saw Joe's hand in every beautifully lit and composed shot; in the exquisite art direction; the flawless costume design; the rousing and powerful score; the punchy and dramatic editing. In every aspect of this astonishing movie I saw Joe Wright fulfilling his potential as a filmmaker. And somehow it now feels right and proper that it happened with this particular film, rather than any of the others. Because Churchill was the greatest leader our country has ever had. So I'm really glad Joe didn't bugger it up!",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Like eating your vegetables,"The Darkest Hour is a ""vegetable"" movie-it was good for me to watch, even if I didn't enjoy it as much as other movies.

"Outstanding acting, with (mostly) great directing.","Gary Oldman is outstanding as Winston Churchill, providing a captivating performance of Churchill's 'Darkest Hour'. For the most part Joe Wright does a great job will flashes of artistic brilliance in an effort to make the film special. Hitting this mark on the odd occasion, his desire to create something unique and special actually detracts from the main draw of the movie, Oldman's performance. As a result most of Churchill's dialogue is forgettable as it becomes less about the man and more about the reaction of the people around him- mainly the government and the British public.Nevertheless it is still well worth the watch with one of Oldman's best performances on screen. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

The scene in the Underground was compelling. But it never happened. Edward R.Murrow wrote some of the best words of the millions written on World War II. Yet his memorable line about Churchill mobilizing the English language is attributed to Lord Halifax. King George had a speech impediment yet there is no hint of it in this movie.

Very Good performance by Gary Oldman,"Watched this film this evening. Whilst I don't have much historical insight to know what Winston Churchill's behaviours or mannerisms may have actually been like it is certainly a very convincing and believable portrayal by Gary Oldman.If you are not someone that is particularly into history then you may find the film rather limited, due to the fact that it focusses rather narrowly on the crucial events that surrounded Dunkirk as opposed to the broader conflict at large.However, it isn't easy to portray a film that is essentially a biopic with the charism a of other genres, simply due to the limitations that go along with real world human life, and for a biographical film this is very atmospheric, believable and engaging, and certainly worth a watch for a very good performance by Gary Oldman.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

"A surprisely above the average ""biography"" film","Ok, I know that this is not exactly an biography movie, but you know, it's the history of a short lifetime period of a real guy, who did great things, so it's in a way, a biography.And, once again (like we get with Battle of Sexes) we have some really above the average biography here. I think that do a biography movie is something really tough to do, so not every director can, but here, Joe Wright does a great job.The movie is very good, the approach of Churchill's life, and how the world simply fell on his shoulders in like two weeks is fantastic. It's also amazing to see, how ""weirdly"" this movie and Dunkirk in a way complete each other, every time they talked about Dunkirk, I ""knew"" how badly thing were back than. The conection, even thoght it was not something planned, is amazing.So the script is pretty decent, the speeches are fantastic, and some Churchill's scenes are remarqueble. The acting is just stunning, Gary Oldman is a monster, there isn't another way to describe he in this role, the guy is a legend, give him an Oscar. But also, the supporting cast is extremely competent here, Lily James give us a solid performance, with such a charism, even though she hasn't many lines throught the movie. Ben Mendelsohn is great as King George, Stannis Baratheon (just kiding) is very good too. Anyway, you get it, the cast is awesome.The soundtrack is ok, the montage is interesting, with some different styles, using like the calendar popping up on the screen, to show us how much time pass.Probably the only issues that I have with the movie is regarding the filming style, I think that the movie is great shoot, but sometimes the director seems to go a little bit over the top in some scenes, like the close up in the hands of the boy, or some going back shoot of the top of a building, anyway, is just a little thing. Also I think that the overuse the ""motivation speech"" on Churchill's life, I don't know how much there is true (and this why is hard to judge) but every once in a while some one as to say some motivation words to him. Again, is not a big flaw, but those thing prevented the movie to be a 10/10 one for me.In short, Darkest Hour is a great film, and deserves to be in the Oscar run. Gary Oldman gives the best performance from him that I ever saw. And one really big plus is the powerful and great history that the movie tells, one of the most important figures of mankind in modern times, for sure.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Thinking Man's Movie,"For all it's obvious grit, gore, loss and greed, this movie serves as a behind the scenes reminder to how much of WWII was fought not just on the battlefields but in the stuffy buildings (and minds) of the British. I will not detail every nuance of this film as I'm others have more succinctly presented, but I will say there's something here which is quite undeniably unique. 
As Winston Churchhill, Gary Oldman graces us with a very dedicated performance, (which was not solely achieved in makeup alone but...) admirably represented a significant amount of research resulting in his very complete character. The accompanying cast filled their roles well, no doubt inspired by equally well-designed sets---transporting us back to a part of historic Great Britain. Yes, the movie dragged a bit, something this category often does. But I felt it was a timely shift from the blood we often see in war movies to a view of what goes on in the minds of men who make good things happen.
Darkest Hour paradoxically brightens near the end as Churchhill questions the people on the train, a scene it felt the whole movie was waiting for. Bringing the whole story together, and possibly serving as a challenge in asking ourselves the same questions.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Darkest Hour,"Frankly bizarre to make a Great Man biopic of Winston Churchill in 2017. Few (if any) attempts at nuance here: character flaws are limited to his being rather disagreeable; this appears to be Britain's ""Darkest Hour"" only because people aren't listening enough to Churchill. He certainly claims to have doubts over what the right course is, though never acts as such (not helped by the audience (hopefully) knowing how the affair will end). Largely an act of historical revisionism - Churchill's friendly interaction with a black man blatantly flies in the face of his well-documented views on race. Oldman certainly looks the part, and successfully manages to capture a variety of tics and idiosyncrasies. Not sure this quite qualifies as an extraordinary performance, though; his outbursts and excessive harrumphing tends to reach levels of overacting - in keeping with the spirit of the whole picture, it feels shamelessly targeted for the Academy Awards. All other characters are completely tossed aside and scarce attempts at development (e.g. Having a brother at Dunkirk) fall flat, despite competent performances across the board.Joe Wright's direction is likely the main strength of the film: consistently interesting staging and cinematography - overhead shots, extreme close-ups, long takes, varied lighting, et al - maintain viewer interest, if a little too flashy for the grounded nature of the story. The colour grading is unpleasantly desaturated throughout. The score is often overbearing, particularly once the movie enters its final half hour. At this point it shifts gears from a serviceable character piece à la The King's Speech, to a clumsy, Oscar-bait melodrama. There is a notably *awful* scene in a tube train, then some payoffs which were set up too blatantly earlier to feel satisfying, and finally a recitation of Churchill's famous ""we shall fight"" speech. Cheering, fade to black, obligatory text explaining the outcome of the film's events. Overall, not bad by any stretch - but, largely unnecessary and mostly dull (with a pathetic conclusion).",5.0,Anonymous,Biography

Oldman's finest hour,"I've just come back from a screening of the new Winston Churchill film, 'Darkest Hour,' and I have to say I'm pretty blown away. It might as well have been a one man show, as Gary Oldman appeared better than ever as the man himself. It says it's 'based on true events' which is pretty accurate. Oldman seemed so lifelike and believable as the wartime leader of Britain that sometimes it almost felt like it was a documentary.It begins a year or so into the Second World War where Britain is already at war with Germany. Current Prime Minister, Neville Chamberlain, has lost the confidence of Parliament and the King is forced to allow Churchill to take over the war effort. I didn't know much about the film before I watched it (apart from the obvious, i.e. that it was about Churchill) and did assume that it would chart his time in office throughout the entire conflict. However, it only really focuses on about a month or so of time - I guess the part of the war which could indeed be described as Britain's 'darkest hour' when the British army looked lost, no one was coming to help (the army or the country!) and a deal with Hitler looked like the only way out.I'd like to think that cinema goers all over the world will appreciate this piece of (dramatic!) history not only for Gary Oldman's Oscar-worthy performance. Being British it did stir up just a smattering of national pride, but I'm guessing that won't be the case for other nationalities.It's worth noting that a film so 'character-based' (as opposed to simply having superheroes destroying a major city) doesn't have many special effects or amazing 'set-pieces,' however, what sets it up isn't just Gary Oldman's acting, but also the make-up team who turned him into the hunched, balding old man he was portraying.The only thing that irked me about the whole film was one scene near the end. It felt totally unbelievable and scripted. It was more like a scene from a romantic comedy where the lead character learns a valuable, life-changing lesson. I have since Googled it to see other people's opinions on it and, as I thought, it was a moment of total fiction that was put in to 'represent' this defining moment in Churchill's life.The film is a couple of hours long, but it certainly sped past for me. It's rare that a modern film can capture a person so greatly and it's all down to Gary Oldman (and also the team of make-up artists!).",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

A really good film in every way and perhaps an important one for us all.,"It's not very often that I am glued to the screen throughout a film - there are usually bits when time drags, when the plot is muddled, the cinematography or sound didn't work well or actors did not jell in their parts. Not so in Darkest Hour. Almost everything about it was excellent. Every actor played their part superbly but Oldman's portrayal of Churchill was nothing short of amazing. It was never an actor playing Churchill, it really was Churchill! Sure, his makeup and prosthetics were beyond reproach but his voice, which is nothing like the actors voice, was absolutely consistent and accurate from start to finish.The only issue I had with this film was the tube train scene. The screenwriter's research had revealed that Churchill did sometimes ""disappear"" into London and would sometimes talk to ""ordinary people"" to find out what they were thinking and this scene was a fiction based on that. It was however nauseating in the use of stereotypes of London ""working class"" people. And the bit where the black man played (I think) by Ade Haastrup completes a literary quote was particularly nauseating, implying that you would be surprised that a black person could do that. Might have got a 10 without that!But, that aside and forgiven, this is a truly great film and if it doesn't get the awards it deserves then there is no justice! Sound quality which accounts for half of the watching experience was consistently good although there were some silly artificial boomy thumps through the sub-woofers for some reason - presumably a misguided attempt to remind the audience that Dolby Atmos was being used. Atmos doesn't need that - it's very good without gimmicks. Bruno Delbonell's Cinematography, especially his lighting, was as usual beyond reproach, bringing out the beautiful colour rendering with the Arri Alexa. Great that Delbonell used the amazing Cooke S4 lenses, made as they have been in Cooke's factory since 1880 in Leicester England.All in all this is a superb film that, if there is any justice in this world, should bring in the awards. If the second world war means anything to you, I think this is an important film to see. An object lesson in pushing ahead with what is right and not bowing to peer pressure that governments would do well to reflect on.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Best movie I've seen in years,"Glad to take a break from all the cheap superheros sagas and go back to enjoy real cinema. As a sober, yet humorous and emotional depiction of a giant figure of modern western history, Darkest Hour delivers 2 hours of delightful cinema work. In the center of this English jewel the performance of Gary Oldman is a little less than epic. The veteran British actor has played some famous and difficult characters before (Beethoven, Sid Vicious and Vlad the Impaler) but I dare to say this time we got the real thing. Winston Churchill was simply back from the beyond, his spirit channeled through the body and the work of Mr Oldman. Recently we have had the chance to see some other major historic personalities brought to life by the magic of cinema, being Thatcher and Lincoln perhaps the most notable examples. Now you can add Churchill to this list, and put the name of Gary Oldman along with exceptional actors like Meryl Streep and Daniel Day Lewis.This is a solid work in the old tradition of English cinematography. Outstanding acting, marvelous script, accurate editing and pleasant photography are some of the features that make Darkest Hour nothing less than a masterpiece. All those looking for historical facts and accuracy can entertain themselves on endless debates after watching this, but the ones who enter the movie theater in need of a satisfying cinematic experience will be highly gratified.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Better than I thought,"I thought this movie was going to be called 'Gary Oldman desperately acting to get an Oscar' Which to be fair it still could have been, but there is more to it than that.It's a nice insight to what churchill was like, a drunk rude stubborn git. what the movie concentrates on was that it was his stubbornness that won the war, and a ridiculous made up hollywood scene on a the underground..although many facts are left out or manipulated, the movie does show how close Britain came to calling a truce with Germany, and how many people were wanting it to happen and for that it's worth watching.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

See It For The Performance,"True Stories flood cinemas around the world all year long. Quite frankly, the majority of original content in terms of filmmaking all comes from a pre-existing story. Ideas are running out in terms of originality, but great films are still being made regardless and Darkest Hour is one of them. Depending on how you look at Darkest Hour, it's definitely worth mentioning when reflecting on the better movies of 2017. From performances to well-written dialogue, this is a film that transports you into this time period during the hard political times and keeps you intrigued throughout every moment. Although this experience may be a slow burn for some viewers, here's why I believe Darkest Hour deserves your time.Whether or not he's successful in the end isn't the point of this film, but Darkest Hour follows the recent appointing of Prime Minister Winston Churchill (Gary Oldman) as he strives to find the best way to course correct during World War II. Having to decide whether or not to negotiate with Hitler, this movie treads on familiar historical accuracies, while also providing a few new pieces of insight that I was unaware of. The overall plot of this film is quite simple, but it's the intricacies of the dialogue and where the writers choose to take the character of Churchill throughout the film that truly makes it a worthy viewing experience.Gary Oldman plays the both loved and hated Prime Minister and I must say, after experiencing this performance for myself, it's going to take a lot for another actor to deserve winning all the lead actor awards this coming season. Whether he's being comedic for dramatic relief or going all out in one of his speeches, I was truly blown away by how he transformed himself into this historical figure. Yes, that's also due to great direction by Joe Wright and incredibly prosthetic work to complete his performance, but those are all elements that work toward creating a great feature as a whole. Direction and performances were pitch perfect here, but the pacing is where I'd have no make my one complaint.For myself, the dialogue kept the film moving at a very brisk pace, especially a specific sequence involving Churchill riding the subway. If you ever find yourself bored when watching this film, I believe this one scene will win you over. I was truly moved by the way that scene played out. That being said, Darkest Hour doesn't exactly have the action that a film like Dunkirk had earlier this year and that will definitely turn people off. Darkest Hour is more in line with movies like The Social Network or Steve Jobs in terms of letting dialogue drive the entire film. That's a hard pill for some people to swallow, but it really worked for me here, which is why it's such a mild complaint.In the end, Darkest Hour proves that a film doesn't need to be exciting in the conventional ways in order to please moviegoers. I was riveted by certain scenes, simply due to the context of the dialogue being spoken. The drab look and slow pacing would've normally wished for the film to end, but everything about this film was just so well done. From perfect musical cues to performances that will have many in tears, I think Darkest Hour is easily one of the best movies of 2017. Once again, I just have to stress how incredibly talented Gary Oldman is in this role. If you find yourself not enjoying this movie as much as I did, I can guarantee his performance will at least pique your interest in a few key scenes. I highly recommend this film.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Entertaining Propaganda,"Darkest Hour follows the polarising figure for his first month in office, taking over from the recently ousted Neville Chamberlain (a figure I feel history will forever be unkind to), through the evacuation of Dunkirk. Much like many biopics of figures in positions of authority, Darkest Hour absolutely takes historic liberties in order to tell an engaging story worthy of a movie. Churchill is only ever painted as a likeable and sympathetic figure, full of rousing speeches, and moments of self-doubt in the most troubling of times, glossing over his more questionable ethics in regards to race, eugenics, and the British Empire. In fact the film flirts with pure fantasy in order to cover up these more detestable aspects of his character, at one point having him talk to a black man, something that he would never have done, nor would he have taken political advice from a number of women and children. So in many ways, Darkest Hour reads like revisionist propaganda, propping up a man already revered by the right-wing as a wartime hero.Much of the movie is tightly written and directed, really only losing steam in its final act. The sheer desperation and darkness endured by Britain at that time is palpable as we get a privy look into the War Chamber. Churchill was against the odds in trying to bring back British soldiers from Dunkirk, not appear weak or appease the Germans, keep his position of leadership intact against his own party, and stay financially afloat without the aristocracy of his peers. There's one particularly telling moment when Churchill contacts Roosevelt hoping to get an assistance from our American allies, to the point of near begging, only be told the most that can be done is to retrieve planes by dragging them across the Canadian border by horseback. ""Late in more ways than you can possibly know.""However the final act loses its way with Churchill going AWOL to talk to the British public on the London Tube. Churchill was known for going AWOL and gauging public opinion by talking directly to them on the streets of London, but this scene is entirely fictionalised and takes gross liberties with Churchill's character. But above all it ruins the film's pacing, slowing it down to a near halt for an overlong sequence full of cheesy dialogue and inspirational solidarity that plays off as pure propaganda. There were much better, cleaner ways of tying up this particular plot point, without resorting to something so painfully cringeworthy it almost ruins the entire movie.Gary Oldman's performance as Churchill was really good though, there's no doubt about that. Between the extensive make-up work and the complete adoption of Churchill's mannerisms, Oldman gets lost in the role entirely. I'm not entirely convinced it was an award-winning performance, but there's no doubt that the dude has an unmatched talent in playing real-life figures. Kristin Scott Thomas was also really good as Churchill's wife, posing as the emotional backbone to their family dynamic, and emphasising how difficult he was to work with. Lily James was unfortunately misused as his secretary though. She lacks any kind of character or personality, and instead just acts as a walking receptor for Churchill's more sympathetic and brooding moments. Ben Mendelsohn was really good as King George VI, and it was great seeing him in the role of a good guy for once, proving that he has an untapped acting range, beyond always just being the slimy antagonist. The scenes he and Oldman share together are some of the film's greatest highlights.On a more technical level, the film was also a success. The music by Dario Marianelli is unsurprisingly on point. It's a fairly typical orchestral score you'd expect to hear in a biopic, but it evokes the kind of music that works for these kinds of stories, ramping up the tension with beating drums, and the emotional stakes with sweeping strings, tied together with ever arpeggiating piano lines. The cinematography by Bruno Delbonnel was also fantastic as well, offering more creative camerawork than I'd expected. The washed-out House of Commons was a nice touch bringing the film close to its black-and-white era, while imaginative shots like a POV shot from a child looking through his fingers like a telescope, German bombing of French lands seamlessly transitioning into the face of a corpse, and Churchill traveling in his elevator surrounded by a void of black space to show his isolation in his own cabinet, were enough to set the film apart from its contemporaries.Darkest Hour was the perfect choice for VE Day celebrations, but I have to question it's unrelentingly positive portrayal of Churchill. He's hailed as a British hero, and this film only exemplifies that by ignoring his more unsavoury characteristics. He was the perfect leader for wartime, but fairly diabolical as a democratic leader of a peacetime society. The film doesn't care about that, and honestly I can't blame it because that's not the point of the movie. This is about the beginning of his tenure and his successful evacuation of Dunkirk, no more, no less. The acting talent is great, but the whole thing is just a vehicle for Oldman to get his long-awaited Oscar, and the visuals were definitely a pleasant surprise. I give Darkest Hour a respectable 7/10. Just skip the god-awful Tube scene.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Another Terrific British Historical Drama,"The British make different kinds of movies than us Americans do. Americans, always in love with making the most amount of money in the shortest period of time, tend toward the blockbuster spectacles. We invest millions of dollars in special effects computers and, all-too-frequently, measure the success by how quickly the investors see the return.British films, however, seem to focus more on characters and history. Perhaps because they have a richer history to draw on, I'm not sure, but instead of dazzling displays of technical skill, their films develop their characters and nurture their language. Dialog is much more important and they pay careful attention to their use of language. (Granted, the English accents are sometimes difficult to understand - so much so that sometimes I turn on the English captions in order to comprehend the speech.). As a result, they also tend to develop tremendous character actors. Judy Dench is one of them and we have already seen, and reviewed, her movie this Oscar season, Victoria & Abdul, where she does a terrific job portraying Queen Victoria at the end of the 1800s. The movie, like a lot of British films, does not have a huge range of action, but instead focuses on the conversations and interactions of the characters - something the truly demands high-performance actors if it is to succeed. It certainly does with Dench.It also does with Gary Oldman in Darkest Hour. Oldman, another English actor, has received multiple accolades for his performances in three Batman movies and his role as Sirius Black in the Harry Potter movies, but his only other Oscar nomination was for his leading role in Tinker Sailor Soldier Spy. His performance as Winston Churchill in Darkest Hour finally brought him a Best Acting Oscar and it is powerfully deserved. He delivers a commanding performance and is clearly responsible for this movie's success. Oldman's performance seems to allow you inside the heartfelt mind behind Churchill's agonizing decision making in May, 1940. Britain had to make critical choices about its future direction as Hitler's assault on Europe reached nearly definitive and final control. Although Churchill seemed at one point to waiver seriously in favor of Chamberlain's strategy of appeasal, he ended up expressing the long-awaited courage that Britain needed at that time, its Darkest Hour. (Roosevelt, on the otherhand, comes across as a cowardly weasel!)In addition to being Goldman's vehicle for his first Oscar, this movie also won the Oscar for Makeup and Hairstyling. I suspect the acknowledgement goes mostly for the superb job they did on Oldman. The prosthetic nose and jowls they gave him are seamless and I, for one, had to look very closely to recognize Oldman. Although Victoria & Abdul were also nominated in the Makeup category, primarily for the work they did in aging Judi Dench (although they didn't need to age her much), the better work was here in Darkest Hour.
The movie also received nominations for Production Design, Costumes, and Cinematography. I can say that the sets and decorations seemed mostly accurate, although others have identified flaws with certain objects in scenes that didn't belong there. The clothing seemed 1940ish, but since I'm not quite that old, I can't say for sure how accurate it was. Was it of higher quality work than in Phantom Thread (the winner)? - I can't say. But it was certainly more than adequate to represent the scene. And the cinematography was certainly in tune with the title, as nearly all scenes were very dark, reflecting the deep pessimism of the times I suppose, but also requiring some imagination at times to visually understand what was going on!Lily James and Kristin Scott Thomas are the only two females with more than a few lines in the movie. Thomas plays his supportive wife, and James is his secretary. Although the movie has her helping Churchill in major ways with his speech writing, that appears to be a movie license as she did not join his team until later. Another key supporting role comes from Ben Mendelssohn who plays King George VI. In this movie, at least, the king plays a pivotal role in giving Churchill the courage to stand his ground against a withering sea of opposition organized by Chamberlain and Halifax. Whether that is true or not, I don't know.The movie does take other liberties with the known facts. There is a very important scene that takes place in a London Underground where Churchill meets with London commoners just before giving his major, ""Darkest Hour"" speech. Apparently there is no historical basis for that scene, although it clearly helps give Churchill the fortitude to fight Hitler and take an entire nation with him.So the movie may not be totally accurate to history. As long as we acknowledge that, then it is acceptable because a movie isn't required to be 100% accurate as long as it portrays the essence of what happened. And it seem to me that is what British film makers have a special ability to do. The director, Joe Wright, has never been nominated for an Oscar but did direct such great period pieces as Pride and Prejudice, Atonement, Hanna, and Anna Karenina. The writer, Anthony McCarten, received a writing nomination for the Theory of Everything, another British biopic about Stephen Hawking. (It is interesting that a lot of the technical crew for Darkest Hour also worked on the Theory of Everything.)McCarten was not nominated for the Screenplay Oscar for this movie and for a very good reason. The real writing in this movie was done, not in the screenplay, but by Churchill himself as he composed his blistering speeches. Darkest Hour seems to recognize that fact by emphasizing the man and his words as the main vehicles for moving Britain through the dark days of May, 1940. After possibly the most important speech Churchill gave to Parliament, a legislator turns to Lord Halifax and asks 'What just happened?'. To which Halifax replies ""He mobilized the English language and sent it into battle."" That is indeed what happened and it changed the course of history.And that is what British movies seem to do. They aren't about action and superheroes - Americans do that well. Instead they reflect on history, tradition, language, and character. And that would be the reason to see the Darkest Hour.For Oldman's performance and a tour through an important piece of history, I give Darkest Hour 4 stars (out of 5). (Also be sure to see Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk, dealing with the same time period with a very different artistic perspective.)",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Churchil As a hero?,"I firmly believe that a film should have to be seen as a 'film' and there shouldn't be much discussion about the accuracy of historic facts. But when you portray a historic figure who should be in the same line as Hitler as a war-hero, It is criminal. Churchil should not be celebrated. He was responsible for death of millions of my Indian people during WWII. The only reason he is being celebrated is because he was on a winning side. I would request other people to see who was real Churchil and why he shouldn't be glorified.",1.0,Anonymous,Biography

Great movie,"This is a wonderful and inspirering film. I don't think I have enjoyed a movie so much in a long time.
 
There wasn't a single weak scene in the film. I love and admire great acting, and Gary Oldman's Winston Churchill is truly one of the great performances. To say he totally owned the part would be an understatement. I really believed he was Churchill, that's how convincing he was.The script is fantastic and there are so many fine performances by the rest of the cast.
 
I understand that the tube station scene was fiction, but it was so well done, that one could have imagined Churchill actually doing it.

"Despite being a talkie, this exceeded my expectations - mainly thanks to Gary Oldman.","I generally don't like political movies as I usually find them terribly boring. I therefore had the preconceived idea I wasn't going to enjoy 'Darkest Hour'. However, thanks to Joe Wright's unique approach to a political drama, the film surprisingly managed to hold my attention from beginning to end.'Darkest Hour' tells us how Winston Churchill became Prime Minister. He is Neville Chamberlain's successor, who resigned when the Cabinet lost faith in him, and also due to health reasons. Churchill himself was unpopular, but the best candidate at the time. Timing was not the best for him, though, as the world was in the midst of war, and Hitler's troops were advancing to the United Kingdom.Despite all the drama and politics, the film was also unexpectedly funny. This is a very well made film; dramatic when it should be, and funny when it could be. It was a perfect balance, and therefore captivated me all the way.And let's talk performances. My gosh, Gary Oldman was incredible!!! He simply was perfect as Winston Churchill. Gary Oldman is a very gifted actor, but he outdid himself. Absolutely bloody fantastic! The make-up was also insanely good. I hardly recognized Gary Oldman.'Darkest Hour' might not be an action-packed war movie, and is mainly a talkie, but this was nevertheless one very interesting talkie!

An historical movie,"When i went to see this movie, i thought it can be a ""boring"" movie but no! The main interest of this film is purely historical about how Churchill chose to resist while other wanted to negotiate with the Nazis. Gary Oldman played very well the role of the prime minister of that time( Churchill) both in his moods and his doubts! The scenario isn't too original ( this is normal, we can't change the history) but allows me to better understand the history of England during the beginning of the Second World War. It's a great lesson in management and humanity that this film gives us.This movie impressed me, it allowed me to realize that the story might be different with another leader than Churchill.

For Churchill lovers,"""Darkest Hour"" or the film that shows you Churchill's life for two hours. It tells us the story of Winston Churchill between 1940 and 1945, when he was the Prime Minister of Great Britain. you have surely understood it, the story takes place during World War 2. Gary Oldman, the main actor (he plays Churchill, of course) won the Oscar of the best actor for his performance. I think he deserves it, but I also think that he is a bit too much on screen. And that is what makes me dislike (or ""less like"", you choose) the film. It could have been a 10/10 if it had been a bit more about what happened in France, so there would have been more action. Also, there are some scenes that were very, very, very long. And that is one more penalty on the final mark. Indeed, the film is 2h05 long, but I'm sure it could have fit in 1h50. Well, I told you all the bad things I could tell you about the film, but there are lots of things that are good. As the title of my review says, this is the best film that a Churchill lover can see. But if you're not a fanatic, you will like it all the same. So, enjoy!",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
An Oscar Worthy Performance,"Gary Oldman is brilliant in Darkest Hour, he becomes one of most important figures of the 20th century so effectively that I forgot I was watching a movie for a few moments. Oldman's Churchill is fighting a war not only with Germany, but with his own government, who are desperate for peace and appeasement. Churchill was willing to make the hard choices when few wanted to face the reality of the situation Britain was in at the dawn of the war.Joe Wright puts together an excellent film that is not solely dependent on Oldman's performance. Wright captures the mood of England shortly before the war had actually begun to have a huge impact on everyday life. The threat of war was still just a looming darkness in the east, which was why Chamberlain and others were so convinced peace was possible.In addition to Oldman, the rest of the cast performed well, in particular Ben Mendelsohn. Mendelsohn was outstanding as King George VI, the role that won Colin Firth an Oscar in The King's Speech. He perfectly incorporated the lisp into his speech patterns, and he also carried himself like the King who never expected to be King. All in all, Darkest Hour was one of the best films of the year and I would be shocked if Oldman doesn't go home with the Oscar.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

"Gary Oldman is sure to oust you out from your seats on intense outbursts; Joe Wright has done it all in a conventional way, delivering an outright classic.","The Second World War is at its height; the system has fallen and Britain is at its Darkest Hour. Chamberlain has stepped down from the Big Chair, Halifax refuses to take over the reins, and the focus obviously shifts to a man who they believe can win most hearts; a flawed man who's known widely for his strange habits and fitting eloquence, a man who lives upto the reputation he upkeeps-none but one of the greatest Leader-Orators the world has ever had a taste of-Winston Churchill. At the darkest of hours, he takes over the reins, when the country is torn apart by tensions and turmoils; the heading members of the coalition government are against him; it's not by choice they chose him, but due to the lack of a sumptuous alternative. And against their wishes, the Man isn't of the kind who'd give heed to peace-mongers; to win something, you'll have to fight it out he believes. He loves his country and respects its traditions, but his attempts to keep the flag waving high gather wide resentment from among his own colleagues. The Great Leader is presented with an intensified inner conflict, than the outward political drama which is going on. He knows that each of his decisions from now on will count, and not only won't it be a smooth sail, but one demanding more bread than his life indeed!!!It's such a well known story, with multiple underlying aspects to it. Joe Wright, the man who made 'Atonement', chose to make a movie on this one in particular, because he knew how far elucidative and reverberatory a story he could tell on this one. He has managed to rip of multiple perspectives on the same, besides the Great Man demanding a constant centre stage; the movie focuses on the view points of Clementine Churchill, King George VI, Halifax, Chamberlain, Eliza Nel Churchill's personal secretary, and more importantly that of free citizens, as much as it focuses on The British Bulldog. The word 'Dark' is given paramount importance in the whole method of storytelling; most of the drama happens in dark rooms and unlit alleys, and within the brooding darkness of a perplexed mind, Churchill has always housed. They never liked him from Gallipoli; the film rectifies some common beliefs and misconceptions too. Some of his iconic speeches have been featured in the movie, and the arresting flow of visuals blended with a storming performance by Gary Oldman is sure to oust you out from your seats on intense outbursts. Gave me goosebumps, literally.Portraying Churchill, Gary Oldman's is an expression par excellence. Besides impersonating Churchill to the maximum possible extent, in appearance, gait as well as strange poses, he has manifested the essential character of the Man under study, to astounding results. He looks like a Churchill in the eyes, in deeds and posture; even in silhouettes!!! As far as an actor is concerned, he must make the rest feel nothing about his acting at all; at least until the movie ends. I never saw a trace of Oldman in this movie; all I saw was Churchill, who I even took to believe could've replaced the real one. Such a profound feat! Brilliance is the word. Churchill was not only a man famous for his leadership, looks and behaviour, but also for his strong words. The modulation that Oldman has brought about, combined with the strict control he has kept, gives us one of this year's countable performances which will make the Big Race soon. As of now, I'll say it's Oldman; have to watch Phantom Thread more to judge on that one completely! At one instance Churchill says at the peak of his screen tension, ""You cannot reason with a Tiger when your head is in its mouth."" Oldman will make us wonder which side Churchill meant himself to be in; he has both the tiger as well as a fearing doe in his face there!!!The movie is all about inner conflicts, the mind's darkness; it also brings in unheard details about the Great Man. It shows even the great Winston Churchill had stuttered on many occasions, before presenting some of his iconic pieces. The movie was made the same year we had another Dunkirk movie by Nolan; 'Darkest Hour' presents a whole lot of unseen perspective on Operation Dynamo and Churchill's hardbound decisions. There's even a subtle nod to the hasty 'naming ceremony' of the whole operation. There's another great scene where he makes a call to the Whitehouse, asking for help and reinforcements to defend his country; 'Franklin Roosevelt' on the other end is shown as a helpless voice, while the effective drama is taking place in Churchill's face and his head, not to leave out the darkness enveloping his private recess. The movie starts of where the darkness has just crept inside the Men's souls, wounded with fear and ends off on a resolutive high. It shows the ordeals that the Great Leader had to surpass to reach there, the new channels he had to break open towards it. Instead of focusing on the general victory, it dwells and swings inside a perplexed heart; which had to think a great deal in pain, before making an anyway detrimental decision at this hour, with the least harm assured. The age too wasn't favourable for him; Thanks to Oldman's acting expertise, all these details subtly flow. It also has its funny moments; gives some trivial confirmation on the iconic man's strangest ways. His wits were impeccable, as was his uncontrollable rage!Joe Wright has done it all in a conventional way, delivering an outright classic. The Drama is so intense, and rich with emotions; and it's as riveting as the peachiest entertainment flick there is, running in town. A very well written screenplay by Anthony McCarten, and a dashing score by Dario Marianelli has rightly contributed to its ebbs and flows. A really well made movie on one of the most adored figures from History, a ripe man who was always young at Heart and eloquent in speech, 'Darkest Hour' is easily a must watch. Quoting Halifax from the end of the movie-""He mobilized the English language and sent it into battle.""!!!",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Insightful and engrossing political biopic.,"With over 60 depictions in film, television and theatre, Winston Churchill is a historical figure not short on visual portrayals. Only last year John Lithgow won an Emmy for his turn as the former British PM in Netflix series The Crown, whilst the well-received film Churchill explored the few days leading up to the invasion at Normandy. So can Joe Wright's political period piece offer something fresh on Churchill in what is fast becoming a sub-genre all unto itself? Short answer: yes. Wright combines a tight script, gorgeous cinematography and high calibre cast to deliver a gripping wartime drama. This snapshot of history homes in on the famed leader's first few weeks in the job: it's nine months into WWII, Germany is succeeding in their Western Europe takeover, and his ousted predecessor Neville Chamberlain (Ronald Pickup) is conspiring against him. What's more, 300,000 soldiers are stuck at Dunkirk with days to live, King George VI (Ben Mendelsohn) doesn't approve of his methods, and the Americans won't come to the party. All this with the threat of bombing on home soil looming in the near future. You would be forgiven in thinking this must be a 3-hour-plus movie considering the dense, multi-pronged plot, but screenwriter Anthony McCarten smartly recreates key exchanges / moments (excluding a clunky phone call with Franklin Roosevelt) in order to extrapolate greater themes and build the gloomy mood. Behind the camera, and ably assisted by director of photography Bruno Delbonnel, Wright bolsters the storytelling through select sequences in which he unleashes his visual flair. A recurring bird's-eye-view motif superbly encapsulates the total carnage caused by aerial bombings, whilst the West Wing-esque single-take camerawork in the Brit's underground bunker injects a spark into the constant walking-and-talking. Playing the man himself, Gary Oldman imbues his Churchill with equal parts stubbornness and fierce intelligence; his pride often getting in the way, yet his determination to do what he feels right in the face of extraordinary odds ultimately shining through. Having already won the Golden Globe and BAFTA for Best Actor, Oldman's formidable performance-even under heavy prosthetics and make-up-will likely earn him his long overdue Oscar. With such a commanding central turn it's easy to overlook the support cast, but special mention should be given to both Mendelsohn and Lily James; the former showing a side to his talent rarely seen as the quietly instrumental King George, the latter providing an emotionally crucial perspective on events (as both young and female) as Churchill's trusted secretary Elizabeth Layton. Anchored by Oldman's riveting on-screen work, Darkest Hour is an insightful and engrossing political biopic that warrants a big screen viewing.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Drags at first but it's worth it for the latter part,"There have been so many portrayals of Winston Churchill recently it's hard to choose the best one. John Lithgow in the Crown was too tall but very convincing. Albert Finney was droll and memorable. Now Gary Oldman gives a slimmer more sprightly and bouncier stepped version of Churchill. His voice is fine but sometimes he looks to slim and young compared to what we are used to on screen. 
As far as the plot this is an interesting but not perfect movie. A lot of scenes show the appeasers wearing down Churchill. FDR is portrayed negatively. It's interesting to see the planning of Dunkirk from this point of view to complement the grand war movie Dunkirk. The tube ride and final speech is moving and rousing.Lily James is a lovely secretary and Kristen Scott Thomas is a little sweeter than the usual Clementine. The relationship with KG V is interesting.

Courage Appears,"The story of a Nation brought to it's knees and fighting for survival is no myth as this movie demonstrates. Hitler had a war machine that couldn't be stopped and didn't they know it too. When you research this subject, it comes clear that Europe was going to fall into the hands of Hitler sooner or later. One by one the countries gave in and Britain took a stand something Neville Chamberlain the former Prime Minister was unable to do. Everyone remembers his visit to appease Hitler which only led to Hitler stating afterwards England is ours as Chamberlain came across as a weakling. By contrast, Churchill is handed a lose situation and gives it a go only to reach a point where when you are watching this movie, you want to stand -up or at least grip the armchair of his famous words of fighting to the death than give-in. It rouses one to the heights and it di that precisely back then. Everyone knows house to house fighting is dangerous and costly in lives and with nothing to lose Britain if forced into that situation would take as many Nazis with them as they could than give-in.

Mileage may vary based on your WWII knowledge,"I feel a bit unqualified to offer a review of this. So much of the film depended on the viewer having some prerequisite knowledge about Winston Churchill and the politics of World War II, and my lack thereof played heavily into my lukewarm reaction. And that's my main criticism of the film - as someone who doesn't have an in-depth knowledge of the events portrayed here, it didn't do enough to establish the character of Winston Churchill and help me understand his plight. I spent the majority of the film feeling as though I was passively watching the events unfold, mildly interested at best. It probably doesn't help that political intrigue films tend not to be my cup of tea. In any event, the film certainly looked nice and I absolutely admired and enjoyed Gary Oldman's performance.

The Churchill Era of 1940s,"At a time when Germany invaded Belgium and France, Neville Chamberlain's softcore thrusts to deter Hitler's insanity and over 400,000 English soldiers trapped at Durkirk; Churchill in his newly appointed avatar of the Prime Minister shines through his hot-temper and confused guffaws.Gary Oldman's character detested by fellow parliamentarians is the desired choice of the titular Prime Minister during the month of May's darkest hours. Though thought to be the scapegoat on the onset of forceful resignation of Chamberlain, Oldman shows signs of being able and yet an ordinary human being with his trademark glass of whiskey for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Saved from being muddled by the English outcry and King's evident hatred for him, it is Clementine who stands by him like a rock as the dotting wife and the first lady to the iron headed Prime Minister.Scenes of important military decisions being stagecrafted by him in the bathroom, expected English sarcasms thrown during conversations with his young and desperate-to-prove herself typewriter and Oprahesque Radio speeches make the film a true winner.Hits: Anthony McCarten's (The Theory of Everything fame) writing and King Geroge VI admission of being scared by Churchill.Misses: Pregnant pauses by Lily James whose efforts flat-lines after repeated expressions.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Oldman excellent in otherwise mediocre biopic,"""Darkest Hour"" presents a somewhat hagiographic portrayal of Winston Churchill in the days leading up to the Dunkirk evacuation. Churchill is depicted as a steadfast defender of England in the face of both the ruthlessly efficient German army and the hapless conciliators in his own government, such as Neville Chamberlin and Lord Halifax, who see negotiating with Hitler as the way to peace. The clock is ticking, as 300,000 Allied troops are encircled on the beaches of Dunkirk and hard decisions must be made. The cast is uniformly excellent, with Oldman's much-lauded performance a standout, but the movies suffers from historical inaccuracies (discussed at length elsewhere). The scene where the Prime Minister suddenly leaves his chauffeur-driven car and boards an Underground train where he can gauge the opinions of a suspiciously diverse group of Londoners is a particularly egregious example of 'fake history', allegedly inserted to spare modern audiences from the monochrome reality of 1940's British politics. There are also some gimmicky camera tricks that could have been dispensed with. Many people who dislike Churchill feel that films such as this do little to present the darker side of his history and politics. While I have no problem with the perspective the filmmaker's chose, and I appreciate that some dramatic license is often necessary to tell a complex story in a short window, making up facts undermines the credibility of historical films, and, at least to me, diminishes their educational and entertainment value.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Awful tripe,"I knew from the moment the forming of the British Govt. was being called New Administration we where in trouble here. Old man has a really hard act to follow but he can't even get Churchill's voice right. I found myself drifting back to the glorious Albert Finney, Vanessa Redgrave and the peerless Ronnie Barker. What a version of a slightly later story that is. Here the King was even badly played, didn't Joe Wright have a quick look back a ""His Speech"". The history is dodgy throughout. I know WWII movies are Oscar folder and actor's line up to be in them but has English film making got only 2 topics this and cockney wide boys.

A great Churchill,"I read an immense amount of history. I've also read just about everything that's been written about, or by Churchill. So I was reticent about this film going in, and not in the least in wondering how in the world Gary Oldman could possibly take on the role. Not that as an actor he would be incapable, but that he simply is so far from the physiognomy. I guess I'm really out of touch with what makeup artists are capable of these days. The result was immediately believable and the rest was pure story telling. As some have noted, there are moments the script strays. It's perfectly acceptable to have moments of humor and personal reflection, but they began too seem too punctual, as though we needed reminding of the humanity within the unfolding of terrible events ... somewhat like how calibrated novels repeat certain types of scenes every 50 pages. That said, this is a tremendously good movie, both enjoyable and while telescoping and using movie-making liberties (Churchill knew exactly what he was doing, when he flashed a reversed V sign), it is a faithful rendering of the knife-edge a danger the world was in, and how Churchill rode above the politics of the time, and showing why one man, alone, making the difficult choices others can't or won't make, makes the difference. And goes down in History. A movie about real heroism of another sort.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Very entertaining,Because Black Panther was sold out I've actually seen Darkest Hour twice. Unlike some films where you see a whole new layer when watching a film for the second time can't really say that this happened with Darkest Hour.The story is set in a short timeframe of a few weeks as Churchill takes over as Prime Minister of Britain. Whilst I was aware of a lot of the storylines covered in the film I really didn't realise that they happened in such a short space of time. What I thought took a few months was actually just a few weeks. Obviously the focus of the film is Gary Oldman as Churchill. I can well imagine he was thinking about the oscar potential when he read the script and that seems likely to be awarded soon. It is undoubtedly a fine performance and very watchable from start to finish. Well worth watching.,7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Gary Oldman's film,"Experienced Joe Wright makes a solid, historical and preemptively bibliographic film, although at some point the film's handling is dangerous, luckily Joe Wright manages to support his narrative Gary Oldman's fine acting and competent technical direction. The script counts from days before Churchill to be appointed prime minister until moments before the withdrawal of the soldiers in Durquique, the first act is very good and develops the character well, already the second and third are very embolados, although not a third of because we saw only the tip of the iceberg that Churchill faced in order to save England from the Nazi threat that had dominated Eastern Europe, and the film's conclusion comes just when England will once again put itself in the conflict, praiseworthy, because we all know the story, but few of us know the lines between the beginning of it. Joe Wright assumes that we all know of the events of World War II and so it accelerates history, embodies acts and gives no chance to the viewer to blink. An extremely dark photograph, a diversity in the use of light, open angles, narrative mirrors and a good soundtrack are part of the technical aspect of the film, and all of them are competent, perhaps the editing leaves something to be desired, but it's more the script's fault than itself. Gary Oldman understands his character, and acts, maybe he does not live his character in the essence, or maybe we do not notice it because of Churchill being extremely caricature, but Oldman with the course of the film ends up engulfing, and ends up becoming bigger than by Joe Wright, we will have a sure indication to Oscar for Gary Oldman. Finally, in general terms, we can say that ""The destiny of a nation"" is an average film, but that by the performances, characterizations and photography, ends up being a little above the average, but it is probable that it does not stand nor between the films more the first quarter of 2018.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Educational, and well acted, but admittedly very slow-paced.","'DARKEST HOUR': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five)A war biopic starring Gary Oldman as Winston Churchill, when he first became prime minister in 1940. It was directed by Joe Wright, and it was written by Anthony McCarten. The film costars Lily James, Kristin Scott Thomas and Ben Mendelsohn. It's received mostly positive reviews from critics, it's a modest hit at the Box Office, and it's also another upcoming Oscar hopeful (specifically Oldman for Best Actor). I found the movie to be both educational, and well acted.In May of 1940, during World War II, Winston Churchill (Oldman) was made British Prime Minister, after Neville Chamberlain's (Ronald Pickup) forced resignation. Churchill had a poor reputation with others at this time, and he faced a lot of opposition from Parliament. Especially with negotiations for peace (or lack there of). The film centers on this conflict. It also focuses on Chruchill's relationship with his wife (Thomas), and his new secretary at that time (James).I knew little about this specific time in history, before seeing the movie; or at least if I had known much about it, I had forgotten it. So for me, the film was a good history lesson. It also (of course) delivers an outstanding performance from Gary Oldman, and I think Lily James shines in the movie as well. The makeup is pretty impressive too. The film is admittedly very slow-paced though, and it's kind of boring at times as well. It definitely took some effort for me to sit through it all, despite it's multiple qualities.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

This is the story of the man who knew how to change the mind of his people by encouraging them to fight for their freedom. Churchill is described as a funny and courageous character, who is not afraid afraid by critics and he is portrayed by the awesome Gary Oldman. What better to ask ?

"Taut, intelligent drama that doesn't get recognition so much these days","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningIn May 1940, Hitler has invaded Checkozlovakia and most of the eastern bloc, while Allied troops are at his mercy in France. Current Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain (Ronald Pickup) has suffered a vote of no confidence due to his appeasement stance, and so the current government look for someone to take his place. Cue the eccentric, highly strung Winston Churchill (Gary Oldman), whose approach to governance is as unconventional as his lifestyle, sending the establishment into a flurry. As France and other European nations seek to surrender, Churchill flies in the face of popular opinion and vows to fight them till the end.In British folklore, it's hard to imagine a figure more revered for courage and 'bulldog spirit' than Winston Churchill, and yet there's been hardly any attempts to create a dramatization of his life, and how he sculpted his place in history. With Darkest Hour, director Joe Wright has attempted to do this, taking an all star cast and placing the burden on their shoulders to do justice to the great man and his exploits. And the result is a film that even the most drama dodging film goer would struggle to move away from, a testament in itself to the grand job he's done.It may be depicting one of the most dramatic moments in the history of the world, yet despite this, the film itself is pretty much an endless barrage of talking, with hardly any action at all. And so, Wright has an extra hard job of making it enthralling and taut, and it's a credit to him that the writing, dialogue and delivery do keep you on the edge of your seat as they do. Despite a marvellous supporting cast, including Kristen Scott Thomas and Ben Mendolsohn as the King, it is of course lead star Gary Oldman who makes it as exciting as it is. He injects his portrayal of Churchill with that wild, crazy energy you remember from earlier performances in grittier films, such as Leon and The Firm.For the most part, it stays on track and plays out in a realistic, true to life manner, with the possible exception of Winston taking a detour and going on a train (when the standard 'diversity' moment is shoved in our faces.) But whether it's exploding in theatrics or staying grounded in reality, it's still brilliant, seat edge filmmaking of the type you don't get so much of these days. ****",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

A magnificent and timely reminder of good v evil,"I was horrified by one reviewer who claimed that this film had a 'pat' view of the War, portraying Germans as 'evil fascists.' and the Americans as 'nowhere.' In 1940, when the film is set, the US was 'nowhere,' sitting om the sideline of neutrality and leaving us to struggle on alone. And if we forget that the Nazis were evil fascists we are morally done for. This film reminds us just what we were fighting for and who we were fighting against. Every school child should this film. As with all historical films, a few scenes are imagined, but only to underline Churchill's indisputable courage to continue. Gary Oldman is simply wonderful, conveying with brilliance the many-faceted person Churchill was, as well as his oratorical brilliance, which has never been rivalled.

Great Movie,"In 1940, King George VI (Ben Mendlesohn) picks Winston Churchill (Gary Oldman) to be England's new Prime Minister. All fear the war with Germany is being lost and many want Churchill to agree to have Italy start negotiations with Germany. Churchill is against that. Many in Parliament want Churchill out. Churchill orders all civilian boats to go to Dunkirk to help evacuate about 300,000 troops stranded on the beach there. 
 
Since there are 2-Churchill movies out at the same time it is hard not to make some comparisons. First of all in Darkest Hour there is no mention of Operation Overlord, a plan by the Allies to invade France to push the Germans back and this is being discussed at the same time 300,000 troops are stuck in Dunkirk when Churchill orders civilian boat to help evacuate the troops in Dunkirk. The movie Churchill talks about both.The name of Churchill's secretary, who types all his speeches , in the movie Churchill is Miss Garrett. In Darkest Hour her name is Miss Layton (Lily James) Why this apparent difference? There are some other discrepancies, but they are minor compared to the ones just mentioned.I did notice that in both movies Churchill never seemed to have a Security Detail with him.We saw Churchill talk with U.S. President Roosevelt asking for destroyers and Roosevelt says cannot do because of some new U.S. Laws. Then Churchill asks for planes that England has already paid for. Roosevelt says cannot do again because of new U.S. laws. However, Roosevelt does say England can pull the planes into Canada and that would be acceptable. Now here's the thing: The planes issues was never addressed again in Darkest Hour.Nobables: Ronald Pickup as Neville Chamberlain, the outgoing Prime Minister; Kristin Scott Thomas as Clemmie, Churchill's wife.When Churchill was agonizing over what to do: fight or negotiate, he finds support from ""friends"" in a car in the Underground (subway system) and now knows what to do. To sum it up one rider says that if the Germans ever invaded: "" They'll never take Picadilly."" And the rest is history.Acting by all was excellent. In Darkest Hour we see Winston Churchill and not once did I see Gary Oldman. What a performance. The Oscar is a lock for sure. (10/10)Violence: No.

Darkest hour is a Beautiful Movie About Courage Under Insurmountable Odds,"Darkest Hour takes place over a relatively contained amount of time. It covers the month of May in the year 1940. Normally you would want a little more to pass as it would add to the overall scope but I preferred this approach because of how good a job they do of underscoring the danger of this situation. Without stating the obvious, there's a reason this movie is called ""Darkest Hour."" This was a perilous time and between Dunkirk and the Nazi invasion of Western Europe, things really could have spiraled out of control. The tension in the movie is thick and ever present, you never forget for an instant how scary this would have been. This helps the movie because without a lot of action, you needed something to help get you from A to B and my attention never wavered when it came to Darkest Hour.We've had more than a couple biopics now and for better or worse, many of them follow the same beats. One of the more irritating aspects of that is that many movies take flawed main characters and gloss over or ignore the seedier side of their personalities. This was one of the more refreshing aspects of Darkest Hour. Not only is Churchill a complicated man with many flaws, they do a good job of showing that there was reason to doubt him. His record was mixed and he had done a decent amount of flip-flopping to get to his spot. The future looked very bleak and as Viscount Halifax repeatedly points out, peace talks did look like a viable option. Looking back now, Churchill was proven right but I have to credit the movie for showing the other side of the argument. We also see some of the less pleasant side of Winston. He was arrogant, hard-headed and tough to deal with. He also drank way too much for a politician during office hours. But this helps you understand him better as a character and I appreciated that those things were included.If something caught me off guard about Darkest Hour, I was shocked at how beautifully it was shot. The cinematography was eye-catching, they added a lot of interesting shots and style for a movie that might have seemed like a procedural. Maybe I shouldn't have doubted Joe Wright who has done work all over the Hollywood spectrum and his team, but I didn't expect something to be visually interesting in this. They used the overhead shot of a turbulent area a lot but that was the only thing that made me pause for a second. I also have to tip my cap to the people who did the makeup on Gary Oldman. It didn't look flawless, but it was consistent and I wasn't taken out of the movie because it looked cheap or fake.I've touched on a few aspects about Darkest Hour but the centre of the movie's advertising is Gary Oldman's performance as Winston Churchill. This is appropriate, he's as good as advertised and I would hope he wins best actor at the Oscars. This is a good character, but Oldman brings it to another level. He's funny, rude, scary and powerful all rolled into one. Lily James gets the next biggest chunk of screen time as Elizabeth. I think she nails it, her character is very vulnerable but through the time she spends with Churchill, her inner strength and conviction comes out and James does her part splendidly. I hope that Kristin Scott Thomas doesn't get lost in the shuffle as Winston's wife Clemmie. She's very charming and I enjoyed her performance every moment she was on screen. It was interesting to see how different the historical figure of King George VI was played by Ben Mendelsohn as opposed to Colin Firth in the King's Speech. This portrayal was a lot less romantic and more calculating and I actually liked that. Mendelsohn excels at playing this kind of character and he holds his own in every scene he has. I also liked Stephen Dillane as Lord Halifax. He's far from a mustache-twirling antagonist and Dillane does a good job of putting the other side of the argument out there.This movie is so good that I only have one complaint. The ending includes a very emotional scene that is very effective but has limited to no basis in historical fact. That's fine as it underscores some pretty powerful stuff, but it borders on being too sappy. I get why it was there, but you could feel the movie pushing the limits between genuine and over-romantic. I also think this is another adult movie that will have limited appeal to younger people. Again, that's fine but with how good I think this is, I just wish it had broader appeal.This movie is about courage when you're at your lowest. I got swept up in that, I had been through a difficult time lately and this spoke to me in that way. I saw 3 movies on boxing day and this was the best of the bunch. I wasn't expecting such a well-rounded and affecting drama out of this, but it lived up to the billing. If WW2 history interests you or you just want to enjoy some well done historical drama, this is worth going out of your way to see.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
More fiction than reality,"If you can get past the opening 5 minutes of the film then you may be able to deal with the whole thing. I was slightly annoyed when it opens with a spotlight on Churchill speaking in parliament while everyone else sits in gloom, I know lighting is very rarely realistic in movies but this just looked so ridiculous. We also get a slightly frenetic whiny Churchill, I just don't think the voice is quite right. Far from being a superman he's here portrayed as a little pampered, bad tempered, etc but the overall point of the film is that he is right. The film portrays very much Churchill as an underdog, unwanted by his cabinet colleagues, a man walking a lonely path and at times almost overcome with the difficulty of it all. I did like the production design, the recreation of the war room, some of the CGI just doesn't look great but the film mostly sticks to meeting rooms. My favourite scene actually was Churchill being briefed on the likely invasion of Britain, things really couldn't be more serious, also his pleading with Roosevelt for help was another great moment of a desperate man letting his guard down. Churchill's colleagues are largely portrayed as petty man scheming to remove him, even the King is very luke warm about him. It does also show Churchill a more cynical speechwriter, occasionally willing to put a lot of spin on things if he feels British moral cannot cope with the truth. You kind of know where the film is heading though, the title scrawls at the end must be for the very uneducated. The film also panders heavily to a modern audience with Churchill taking a magical trip on the underground to meet the real Londoners who are of course full of pluck and fight and know far more than all the MPs and Ministers sitting in parliament. Churchill the populist! I also found it irritating that the key female relationship portrayed in this film during his moment of crisis was all fictional given he had not even met this secretary yet until 1941. It really was an enormous slice of creative license. The performance isn't bad, it's not perfect either though I feel from Oldman, the story is moving though parts of it are clearly just a screenplay. All in all a mixed review therefore.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
I wish all historical dramas were like this!,"An excellently made film in every way. The acting. cinematography, pacing, almost perfect. Best of all, unlike nearly all other historical dramas, they almost completely refrained from inventing un-historical and implausible stuff to push the film-maker's point of view.Among the few slight failures in this regard was to push a little too hard on the ""Churchill friend of the ordinary common working class people"" angle (combined with the unhistorical portrayal of the Labour Party as always strongly pro-Churchill and anti-Chamberlain/Halifax).Another quibble is a single line giving the impression that George VI hated Churchill because he was pro-Edward VIII remaining king. In fact George VI never wanted to be king, but took it on as his duty after Edward's abdication. Churchill's only input was to publicly worry about whether Baldwin was hurrying Edward (a personal friend of Churchill) into a rash decision. Once it was shown this was not the case Churchill was happy with the abdication. There was never the slightest question of his total loyalty to King George.I thought I knew everything important there was to know about Churchill and WW2. But this film made it so much more real by filling in what nobody else thought to mention.Especially pleasing was that the anti-war Chamberlain and Halifax and their followers were not portrayed as the usual cardboard cut-out cowardly and secretly pro-Nazi idiots, but as true patriots who sincerely thought they were doing the best they could to save another generation of innocents from senseless slaughter; but who discovered that they had been mistaken.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

I Shall Never Surrender!!!,"The lesson that Winston gave us in history; was to never quit, dismiss or ignore your convictions. To strive until the very end, whatever the cost may be, to achieve our own personal goals: Our Victory. Most scholars consider him the greatest British man to ever lived and this movie is proof of it. 
The film takes place during the crucial days leading up to the colapse of France and Wester Europe during the early campaigns of World War II and how a man took upon its shoulders the burden to give hope back to those who opposed Nazi tyranny and oppression across the globe. The movie is all about the resolute of Prime Minister Churchill on his quest to convey its own people that the only way to settle a conflict with an unleashed beast is by fighting back and never give up. 
I have read and heard Winston famous ""We shall fight on the beaches"" June 4 1940 speech over 100 times. I apply to my life the specific message he passed on to future generations on how to approach times of conflict and despair. Hence, my hopes for this film were extremely high, and I must confess I am absolutely satisfied and content with the result. 
The film itself is extremely good. It has all the elements that make a good film...good. Script, Director, Cinematography, Score, Make-up and Performance (& others). The first four characteristics do not require more delve into it, besides the short text I just voiced. The make-up is fearfully accurate to what the man behind the V (for victory) looks like.The works with prosthetics done by Kazuhiro Tsuji is breathtaking. I asked myself: Is this a movie or a documentary?, because simply you cannot tell the difference (or very subtle) between the man and the actor. 
Portraying Winston Churchill is no easy task for any actor. Many have stepped onto his shoes, to name a few: Finney, Gleeson, Burton, Lithgow and others. All of them have given the audience solid performances, however, Gary Oldman is by far the finest interpretation of this beloved historical (ecumenical) character. In just over 2 hours he manages to pass on the viewer the gentle nature of the man in the Top Hat and the strong and resourceful respect he imposes on those around him, because there is no such thing as a godlike man, but only a man that becomes a god when his darkest hour is upon him. 
The movie is probably not the best of the year, but Mr. Oldman performance is without a doubt the best of 2017 (2018 awards). There is no other contender this year that can rival his acting, for I strongly believe he not only deserves an Oscar nomination but the award itself. He steals the SHOW in up to this date his best acting.The rating is of course 9/10, for all the things already mentioned. The only element that could have been done better is historical accuracy (which the movie has in at least 85%). Having said that I encourage you to go out and watch this film, it is formidable in every aspect. You will not regret it, and I promise...you shall never surrender.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

Dunkirk as you like it,"I am somewhat confused with all this WWII heroism of late in cinema. I wrote Dunkirk down as a solid ego booster for Brits who cannot get over the fact that Britain didn't win WWII but this movie is a bit of an overkill. I do not wish to analyze what most already did in these comments, the only thing I want to add that although Gary Oldman is a great actor, his portrayal of Winston Churchill isn't convincing, certainly not to glorify him for it as most people do here. Overall, the movies comes through as a cheesy propaganda movie, the underground scene being the prelude to the climax at the end where we are pretty much informed that 'Winston' won WWII and brought 'all our boys back' from Dunkirk despite the grim 10% prediction. Never mind the French help and never mind the Allies who actually won that war. Never mind all the 'loser' states who have fallen to the Nazis, like Belgium and that ungrateful Roosevelt.

Autistic Reviewers Review Of This Movie.,"This is indeed Gary Oldman's best movie. I suppose it's not so much that he is great at playing Churchhill it's more of the fact that he carries the entire film and Oldman is up for the challenge. He carries the entire film almost all by himself and he does a marvellous job at it. His voice, his walk, his jokes, and his expressions are 100% spot on for playing Winston Churchill!We can both see why he is getting nominated for all these awards. Brilliant performance and highly recommended film. The support cast such as Lily James and Ben Mendelssohn as King George were also good, but It's Oldman who carries the movie.

Oldman gives Oscar-worthy performance in otherwise dull film,"In the 1930s, Winston Churchill (Gary Oldman) spearheaded the efforts to warn about the dangers of Adolf Hitler and his Nazi Germany. British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain was forced into retirement in May of 1940 when Parliament grew tired of his lack of leadership, foresight and results against the impending War. Churchill replaced Chamberlain as Prime Minister of Great Britain, in the early days of World War II. In the early stages of the war in 1940 and 1941, the British Empire was nearly alone in their opposition to Hitler, and Churchill's speeches and radio broadcasts were a source of inspiration in this dark time. One of his most famous and inspirational speeches included ""we shall fight in France, we shall fight on the seas and oceans, we shall fight with growing confidence and growing strength in the air, we shall defend our island, whatever the cost may be, we shall fight on the beaches, we shall fight on the landing grounds, we shall fight in the fields and in the streets, we shall fight in the hills; we shall never surrender.""Darkest Hour is the historical story of the early days of World War II as Hitler began his conquest of Western Europe. Churchill had warned about this and now Great Britain was all but solitary in their defiance of the Nazis. A peace treaty was proposed and it was now up to Churchill to decide what to do. According to the treaty, Hitler would stop his war with Western Europe provided that Great Britain did not interfere with his plans to move east and conquer the USSR. Churchill was never a fan of the treaty and felt that bold retaliation, standing their ground against the Nazis, would be their only hope of true survival. But, Churchill faced a lack of support from his own party, and even felt the pressure to not only entertain the idea of the treaty, but to accept it or face his own removal as Prime Minister. While battling with his doubts about the treaty, his doubts about the chances of Great Britain's survival whether they signed the treaty or not, and his own doubts about his ability to properly discern what was best for his country, Churchill took his fears and doubts to the people. They overwhelmingly expressed their disdain for the Nazis and their resolve to never give in. Thus, Churchill rejected the offer.Director Joe Wright is no stranger to epic historical and moving stories as he has already tackled Pride & Prejudice, Anna Karenina, and Atonement which earned him a Golden Globe nomination for Directing in 2008. While Atonement did win for Best Picture, Wright lost out to Julian Schnabel who directed The Diving Bell and the Butterfly. While neither Darkest Hour nor Joe Wright have been nominated for a Golden Globe, Oldman has been nominated for his portrayal of Winston Churchill, and an Oscar nomination is all but guaranteed as he pulled of one of those rare performances where you do not see the actor on the screen, but rather their character come to life. While all the actors who have been nominated and won an Oscar over the last two decades have deserved their recognition, perhaps the most notable was Daniel Day-Lewis's win in 2013 for his performance as Abraham Lincoln. Oldman accomplishes the same brilliant execution. Not once did I notice that it was Gary Oldman, but rather I saw nothing but Sir Winston Churchill in the movie Darkest Hour. It was inspired, flawless and genius.Unfortunately, for me, the rest of the movie just didn't hold up to Oldman's efforts. I expected Wright's latest work to be a moving, gripping and tense look behind the scenes of the early days of World War II. I had high expectations for Darkest Hour and gave a 4 Star Prediction. To me, it was slow, uninspiring, dull and dragging, especially considering the film is about one man's decision in a time that effectively helped to lead his country and the world out of one of the darkest times in world history. It is worth watching, for Oldman's performance alone; however, if you haven't seen it already in the theatres, wait for it to come out for rent. It's definitely worth renting, and I might watch it again, but I'm pretty sure it won't find a home in my permanent collection. Therefore, I'm lowing my rating to 3 Stars. www.marksmoviemind.blogspot.com",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Stop What You Are Doing, and Go See this Film!","Stop what you are doing and go see Darkest Hour without delay! This is by far one of the best pictures of 2017. In this film, you walk alongside Winston Churchill (Gary Oldman) as he makes some of the most difficult decisions for the United Kingdom during World War II.Faced with a difficult situation as Churchill assumes the role of Prime Minister and with opposition from his own party, Oldman plays Churchill masterfully. One might recognize the name-Oldman- as Commissioner Gordon from the Dark Knight Trilogy, but you would never recognize him by looks or demeanor. Oldman played Churchill with chilling effect and you could not help but keep your eyes on his character wondering what he would do next. Oldman should be up for Best Male Actor for this portrayal. It was not just Oldman, however, that contributed to the great acting. The entire cast was brilliant in the picture.Director Joe Wright comes off the success of Anna Karenina and very well may have made a film worthy of being in the best picture category. Wright draws on the human need of survival through his cinematography, which helps the audience root for the decision we already know the UK made.Overall, the picture is worth your time and opens the door (and your eyes) to a piece of history that, if done differently... could have drastically altered the world we live in now. The acting was great and the overall quality well done. Go see this picture and thank me later.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Churchill's Triumph Against Hitler on the Oscar Stage,"I watched the film ""Darkest Hour,"" depicting Winston Churchill's life during the struggle against Hitler. The movie provides a compelling portrayal of Churchill's leadership during a crucial period in history, earning it the prestigious Oscar in 2018. The narrative delves into the political and personal challenges Churchill faced, showcasing his resilience and determination in the face of adversity.

A showcase of a historical drama that gives informative insight into a legendary figure.,"I for one am a history buff and enjoy movies about real life figures especially men and political figures that were involved in war times and times that impacted history. ""Darkest Hour"" is one picture that's very well done and gives fresh and plenty of insight into Winston Churchill(in a blowout performance from Gary Oldman his actions and manners are in top form). As the film's focus is the early days of War War II and how the fate and balance of western Europe hung in the balance.Churchill(Oldman) who's unpopular to many has just been named British prime minister and the balance of power is in question as he and others face the cruel and brutal Hitler. Does a nation choose between war, or peace with liberty and freedom? The film shows many scenes of debate and discussion as plenty of thought and decision making goes into play. Plus Winston is not without his vices as he enjoys to much chain cigar smoking and guzzles many glasses of whiskey it's like he's an alcoholic! Still his mind and determination is sharp and on point for an old overweight man. This man is a champion of the people as his listens to his country first, Winston Churchill was not a man who was afraid to act, or change his mind for the best interest he was a hero. Plus see this film for the performance of Gary Oldman as it's one historical war biography drama not to be missed.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Entertaining,"An approximation of a particular historical moment: what is most remarkable is the casting and makeup that presents actors who look very much like their real counterparts.

Gary Oldman imitation is justly praised.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Depth and light and shade in one of the great films with a great performance.,"This wonderful film manages to give a 360 view of Churchill's ascent to power at perhaps the most difficult time in British (and soon world) history. The script therefore is perfect; it's delivery by the actors is nigh perfect; by 1/3 in, I later realised that although I knew it was Gary Oldman, I believed it was Churchill. This movie is funny at times, deeply moving at times. Special mention also go to the performances of Ben Mendelsohn as King George and Ronald Pickup (who once played Churchill's father) as Chamberlain. Lily James is luminous and very good and Kirstin Scott Thomas too.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
"A Great Film, Similar to Lincoln in Many Ways","If you found Lincoln to be a moving film about a great historical figure played by a respected actor doing some of his best work, with great emotional resonance at its core, then you will find the same things in Darkest Hour.This film centers around Gary Oldman as Winston Churchill, and focuses on his first three weeks as British Prime Minister in May of 1940, when nearly the whole of Europe has been conquered by Nazi Germany, the British Army is being forced to the sea at Dunkirk, and there is the very real possibility that Britain will be left defenseless.Oldman shines in this role, and the makeup team did great work transforming him into Churchill. Truly, he is a chameleon in any role he lands. There are great emotional stakes at work in this film, as it is made clear that Churchill is an older man who has a very particular style, and often struggles to get certain thoughts out in a coherent and convincing manner.While props must be given to Kristen Scott Thomas who portrays Clementine Churchill, the truly standout supporting role is Lily James as Elizabeth Layton, Churchill's secretary, who often conveys great emotional weight using only her eyes and her posture. Her scenes alongside Churchill are the best in the film.Where the film falters is in the pacing, which does tend to drag in the middle a bit. Also, if you go into this film knowing nothing about the historical context of the players involved, then certain character motivations will be left either unexplained, explained in passing, hard to hear, or explained very clunkily in an obvious manner, such as Churchill's involvement in the Gallipoli campaign in World War I.That aside, though, you should see this film simply for Oldman's performance, which is stunning, and he is most deserving of at the very least an Oscar nomination for Best Actor.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

Hour that is Dark,"Darkest hour definitely fits the title of the movie especially with the lighting. The days were never really bright and sunny, it was usually raining or gray and cloudy skies. So the overall dark theme with the dark times in the war and with congress worked really well. The Winston Churchill actor in the movie looked a lot like the actual Winston Churchill so that was done nicely.

'You can not reason with a Tiger when your head is in its mouth.',"History wrote this story but Anthony McCarten translated it into a screenplay for Joe Wright to direct one of the truly great films of the year. The film is about the month of May in 1940, the odd rise to power of Winston Churchill, and the near miraculous survival of the island of England because of the rascal/devil obstinacy of Churchill's commitment not to give in to Hitler's sweep of the world into a globe of fascism. And crowning the importance of this film is the impeccable performance of Gary Oldman in the role of Churchill.'Hitler has invaded Czechoslovakia, Poland, Denmark, and Norway. 3 million German troops are now poised on the Belgian border, ready to conquer the rest of Europe. In Britain, Parliament has lost faith in its leader Neville Chamberlain. The search for a replacement has already begun...' So opens the film. With Europe on the threshold of World War II as Hitler's armies rampage across the continent's once proud nations, the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Neville Chamberlain (Ronald Pickup), is forced to resign, appointing Winston Churchill (Gary Oldman) as his replacement. But even in his early days as the country's leader, Churchill is under pressure to commence peace negotiations with the German dictator or to fight head-on the seemingly invincible Nazi regime, whatever the cost. However difficult and dangerous his decision may be, Winston Churchill has no choice, but to shine in his darkest hour. He gains the favor of King George VI (Ben Mendelsohn), the assistance from his secretary (Lily James) and wife (Kirsten Scott Thomas), and the tolerance of peacenik Viscount Halifax (Stephen Dillane). Of course the ending is known: Churchill overcame the darkest hour and saved England by refusing to stand down.This is one of the most successful historical films to date and it is so very appropriate that it was released in the same year as DUNKIRK - the battle that involved the people and polished the British tenacity. Grady Harp, March 18",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Darkest Hour: Dunkirk's Political Counterpart,"Director Joe Wright's award winning Darkest Hour not only met my expectations - it exceeded them. Here is why:The narrative of Darkest Hour is set forth with flair, drama and comedy. As in some of the best stories, the movie dives deep into the protagonist's character, demoting the subject of the war to second place. The story's result is no secret - instead, it deals with a lesser-known, more personal subject. The million-dollar question is not so much - will the troops at Dunkirk escape the beaches - as - will Churchill prove to be a competent leader of Britan? Some people may roll their eyes at dramas so apparently predictable (though many dramas are more riveting than actions), and indeed the film does use a rather formulaic plot strategy; yet it doesn't feel so. It is engaging, unique and fresh, though a bit talky by the end. The unobtrusive humour meshes naturally with a generally serious mood. I would be remiss in omitting a few brow-raising details addressing the relations between fact and fiction. Cinema, sadly, very often finds reason to warp a previously established premise into any shape or form considered necessary for the ""adapting"" from history or book or play to the screen. In this case, Churchill's notorious reputation in the film seems a mere conjecture - certainly by 1940, the man was famous for his poor military stratagems in Gallipoli, ect - yet it seemed hardly an obstacle to his national leadership. Common opinion at the time may be assessed by an American visitor to Britain at the time, as quoted on Wikipedia: ""Everywhere I went in London people admired [Churchill's] energy, his courage, his singleness of purpose. People said they didn't know what Britain would do without him. He was obviously respected. But no one felt he would be Prime Minister after the war. He was simply the right man in the right job at the right time."" Evidently, the movie plays rather heavily on a fictional antagonism generated by the British citizens and parliament and directed towards Churchill. I wish it could be otherwise - the story the way it is presented in the film is quite charming.Need I praise Gary Oldman's performance? I think yes: I shall unite with most other reviewers, and uphold Darkest Hour's Winston Churchill as (though historically false) altogether a joy to behold, and a unique protagonist, I think - in that, for the first ten minutes, you identify more with his fresh-faced typist (Lily James) than with the sour old crosspatch who debuts as something of a nobody and a failure in life. Without spoiling the movie, I certainly can't agree Churchill's temper was justified, and despite the burden laid on the man's shoulders, he was largely a crusty, selfish person; at the same time, I admire his perseverance, his can-do attitude, and his ultimately selfless intention. Oldman makes the film worth your ticket with arguably his best performance to date. A sort of veritable towering mass of quivering prosthetics, Oldman underwent a nigh on incredible transformation in turning Churchill - a feat deserving of the ready incredulity of millions. This dominating character is juxtaposed nicely with that of his typist - a fervent soul who is in a way caught up in the tragedy that is war as much as her superior. The cast is rounded out with a collection of politicians of varying rank - Ronald Pickup played Neville Chamberlain well, yet I should liked to have seen the late John Hurt in the role.If the acting is great, the visuals are superb. From the opening scene, I was blown away by the style, class and the drama arising from the creative lighting, cinematography and editing decisions. Where recent films have only partly succeeded, Darkest Hour remains a consistent film for the whole duration in looks and mood. It pleased me no end, and I'd love to lay eyes on the Blu Ray edition. I noticed the general brightness felt very subdued, not due to shadows, but rather as though everything was submerged in a dull half-light, which lent the film the sensation of being forever in the thick, murky shade of something titanic - whether it was the dread of war, the drab London buildings overshadowing the lives of all, or something else altogether, I cannot say. For all that, the movie remained fresh; fresh, only, not in the sense of brightly coloured greenery. The mood described above brings to mind a sort of modern noir - again, not because of clearly cut shadows, but of dramatic lighting.Too many blockbusters rely on grandiose light shows and immense scale to impress audiences without necessarily giving them much (if any) food for thought - a sort of wow-factor competition among the elites. Don't get me wrong - I love effects as much as the next man. Only, I find mediocre narratives driven by millions of dollars worth of explosions an entire waste of ability, time and money. Oscar contenders, on the other hand, tend to be more character-based, more artistic, usually not relying too heavily on effects, I find. This most often leads to immoral, revolting movies which audaciously broadcast the current agenda to the American and international audiences. All right, both ways you lose? Not necessarily. The films of both categories that excel at their art are a joy to behold, and I hold that Darkest Hour delivers a solidly entertaining, visual effects-minimal drama of very high quality. It is mature, amusing, and beautiful to watch. If you see it, make sure you pair it with its partner, Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk, as they harmonize so well anyone would think they were made purposefully to belong together.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Churchill's Greates Hits,"Allen Packwood, director of the Churchill Archives Centre referred to former British Prime Minister Winston Churchill as an ""incredibly complex, contradictory, and larger-than-life human being."" This complexity is lost, however, in Joe Wright's (""Pan"") Darkest Hour, a look at a crucial time in British Prime Minister Churchill's stewardship that covers the period from May 10, 1940 until his famous speech to the House of Commons on June 4th. This was the speech in which Churchill declared that, in the fight against Nazi Germany, Britain would fight to the end and never surrender. Written by Anthony McCarten (""The Theory of Everything""), the film stars Gary Oldman (""The Space Between Us"") as the confident leader who carried Britain through one of the most challenging periods in its history.Beneath Oldman's makeup and mannerisms, we get a sense of what Churchill was really like, but it is more of a master class in acting than a three-dimensional portrait. Churchill's most familiar personal trademarks are ticked off: his bluster, mumbling, drinking habits, cigar smoking, soaring speeches, and buoyant sense of humor, but it feels like a compilation of his ""greatest hits."" The main focus of the film, however, is not Churchill's personal idiosyncrasies but the political conflict between those who want to negotiate with Hitler and those who prefer to fight to the end, whatever that might look like. When Prime Mister Neville Chamberlain (Ronald Pickup, ""The Time of Their Lives""), who will forever be associated with the word ""appeasement,"" is forced to resign, no candidate besides the First Lord of the Admiralty, Winston Churchill, is acceptable to the opposition.Those who oppose him include Chamberlain, Lord Halifax (Stephen Dillane, ""The Crown,"" TV Series), and King George VI (Ben Mendelsohn, ""Una"") who see him as too ""hawkish"" and urge Churchill to ask Mussolini to negotiate a deal with Hitler in order to prevent an all-out invasion of Britain. Churchill, however, is convinced that making deals with Hitler will lead to the end of British independence and the film does not seriously consider other viewpoints as having any merit. While the new prime minister's boundless optimism did much to inspire Britain, Wright also shows him to be torn by doubts. In one scene, Churchill sits alone by himself in a darkened room, suggesting a struggle with depression, as has been rumored.By this time, Hitler has already conquered Norway, Belgium and France are near capitulation, and 300,000 British soldiers are surrounded by German forces at Dunkirk. Haunted by his part in the heavy loss of life in the World War I Battle of Gallipoli, the prime minister has to come up with a plan to save the men but little help is offered. Cinematographer Bruno Delbonnel (""Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children"") creates an atmosphere of musty corridors and underground rooms where there is little light or air and where life or death discussions take place. In spite of the gloom, there are moments of humor. We listen in on a phone call between Churchill and FDR where Churchill asks for help and Roosevelt tells him that he ""can't swing it"" because of U.S. neutrality, suggesting that he should get horses to pull B4 bombers across the border into Canada.Support from his acidic wife Clementine (Kristin Scott Thomas, ""The Party"") and his devoted but put-upon secretary Elizabeth Layton (Lily James, ""Baby Driver"") are welcome interludes, but they basically serve as a distraction and we learn little about Churchill's personal life other than one contrived conversation with the King about his parents. While the film zeroes in on Churchill's thought processes, embellishments to the historical record sentimentalize his achievements. At one point when he is still considering the proposal to seek negotiations, he bounces out of his car to take the Underground to Westminster. On the train, he talks to the people asking them about their attitude toward negotiating with Hitler and is buoyed to hear when they tell him to never negotiate. It is an event that never took place.There is no doubt that Churchill was a great man who helped save the world from the Nazi barbarians and Darkest Hour makes that clear. It does not, however, present a balanced portrait, ignoring Churchill's blemishes as if they never existed. While we can all celebrate Churchill's courage and fierce determination, no mention is made of his lifelong dedication to British imperialism and his disdain for Gandhi and the Indian independence movement, or his virulent anti-Communism, casual anti-Semitism, and support for the Spanish dictator Franco. They were not his finest hour.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Solid 7/10,"Darkest Hour is directed by Joe Wright and stars Gary Oldman, Lily James and Ben Mendelsohn. The movie takes place in the beginning of WW2, Hitler has just sent his army to the neutral Belgium. Britain's house of parliament is in chaos. Neville Chamberlain (Ronald Pickup), who signed a peace treaty with Hitler only weeks earlier has lost all his support in the parliament. The only man that the opposition will accept is Winston Churchill (Gary Oldman), a politician with a past full of fiascos. Hated by his colleagues, Churchill must rule the UK in a state of crisis with all odds against him.Darkest Hour isn't an action movie, it's a political thriller about one man's stand against the Nazis with the whole world on his shoulders. The focus is 100% on Churchill, luckily Oldman pulled it off. He's totally worth the nomination for best actor and with this superb performance he should win the award. Oldman brings new aspects of Churchill to the big screen - an energetic, funny and slightly awkward Churchill. The movie is genuinely very funny, but doesn't lack the amount of powerful scenes, such as Churchill's famous speech - it made me shiver. Wright got the tone of the movie just right. The cinematography is stunning, the lightning was outstanding.What about the cons? Even though I like the fact that the movie focuses on Churchill, it does bring some problems. The other character arcs are really thin, they're just there. James and Mendelsohn give really good performances with what they have. However, the actions of the characters are seldom motivated and don't work at all with Mendelsohn's character. Another negative is the music. I'll admit, in the last scene it made my jaw drop, but otherwise it never really was there. There were many powerful scenes where the music felt sort of ""meh"". My last minus is that the movie is very British, it makes fun of the allied leaders, such as president Roosevelt. Darkest Hour is a politically correct movie that celebrates Churchill. But why ruin other big names during that time period? With all aspects considered I'm going to give Darkest Hour a solid 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Proud to be British,"Having recently watched the film Dunkirk I fervently hoped that Darkest Hour was not going to be a chopped up concoction of out-of-sequence scenes.
Thank goodness it wasn't.
This film moved through time in the normal way. Day by day, in the right order.
I only hope that the makers of Dunkirk study this film and apply their findings to their future work.Darkest Hour is an excellent piece of entertainment, not a history lesson, but offers a good depiction of the May 1940 period.
It is very well acted with Churchill and the King leading the way.This film covered the two possible responses to an attack on this country - fight or sue for peace.To the people of the UK I would point out that nothing changes.
The country is again under attack and there are schemers who think that they know best.
These schemers truly believe that, although the 'plebs' may have voted for one outcome, they can be ignored.Blair, Osborn and Branson are today's version of Halifax and his cohorts of the 1940's.
If Halifax had got his way we would now be governed (at best) by Germany.
Blair etc seem to have the same objective.The question is, ""Can May be as successful as Churchill in the defense of the UK?""Let us hope that our ""Darkest Hour"" is not yet to come.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

We are following Winston Churchill, played by Gary Oldman, the Prime Minister of Great-Britain from 1940 to 1945. He succeeded Neville Chamberlain and stood firm against collaborating with the Nazis. The movie is a great summary of all this tense period, when Churchill had to take important decisions. In addition, Gary Oldman's actor's game is astonishing ! It only took me a few minutes before I was fascinated by this man. Throughout his emotions, his sense of humor and his personality traits, I could really imagine how stressful it was to carry the future of one's country ! Supporting roles are also very convicing.

A Truly Inspiring Performance,"Having watched this film twice now I can say that Gary Oldman gave the performance of his career and I will be extremely surprised if he does not win the Oscar for best actor. The film is never boring and keeps the story moving in a graceful way. Although it is a film about a truly horrible time in world history it still manages to bring in many instances of humour to break up the solemn mood. The story manages to contain only what is needed, perfectly capturing the mood of the United Kingdom in that time, without dragging the story too far into the war. Once again Gary Oldman manages to give a rousing performance of Churchill's vocal quirks, such as his mumble as well as the emotion conveyed in the low timbre of his voice. Also facial expression still manages to be conveyed even under all of the prosthetics/makeup proving just how great a performance it really is. Highly recommend for all.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

"A Powerful Performance by Oldman, Given the Stage to Itself","Against the backdrop of the second world war, with mainland Britain on the brink of a Nazi invasion, Winston Churchill is appointed prime minister amidst almost universal reluctance. Determinedly anti-capitulation, he's swimming against the stream from day one with an embarrassed, vengeful political faction in his war ministry and a wary, unconvinced king watching his every move. The entire weight of this film rests on the strength of its central performance, as one might argue any biopic should, and Gary Oldman, once again, proves up to the task. His take on Churchill is transformative and enveloping. He lives the role, becoming this historical giant through wardrobe and makeup, but also speech, posture and subtle mannerism. The power of his convictions on full display, we can almost see each sharp, momentous proclamation form upon his quivering lips before it's barked out into the air. In fact, that formulation is a crucial piece of the story: as his speeches and opinions develop, we see them change shape, wording and direction, progressing through various rough drafts to a tight, powerful, focused final product. The plot tends to slow down at points, and not every supporting character deserves the scrutiny they receive, but as mere decoration for the one man show, those flaws can be somewhat overlooked. Overall, it's a very well-constructed, finely focused narrative that gives the audience a sweeping glimpse of the man himself, both guarded before the sting of his political enemies and vulnerable in the friendlier confines of his home or office. Interesting to pair this with Dunkirk, a fellow Best Picture nominee, as the two explore the same military event from very different perspectives.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

Darkest Hour is Quite Illuminating,"""Darkest Hour"" stars Gary Oldman as Winston Churchill and follows his first month as Prime Minister. In it, Churchill immediately has to deal with important decisions of what England is to do about Hitler and the second World War.The two big aspects that people remember from this movie are: the makeup to transform Oldman into Churchill and Oldman's transformative performance in the role. The two aspects rightfully gained Academy recognition for their success. And yes, the two elements combine to do their job just right. Watching the film, you completely forget you are watching a performance and just get sucked into the world it ahs created.The film does its best to stay tightly edited, moving along from point to point at a slick pace. But even with that, there are only so many ways you can try to make old timey parliament look interesting.Outside the makeup and performance, what the film does best is battle with the question of ""where do you compromise?"". This presents good themes when it comes to times of war and politics. Churchill himself isn't always a 100% likable guy, I admire the fact the film doesn't shy away from showing his flaws.Some of the plot points feel a bit underdeveloped, and like any based on true story movie, there is more to the story that can't be shown. So, the film can at times feel like only a small part of a much larger more interesting story.If you are looking for an informative, entertaining and at times inspiring story of Winston Churchill, take 2 dark hours and watch this film.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

"There should probably be three ratings for ""Darkest Hour"": film, history and ""what if"" history","As a film goer, I give it a 10. It conveys a sense of the greatest moments in world history with the type of emotion such an event deserves. As an aside, it, by comparison, shows where the other movie on the event ""Dunkirk"" failed so miserably. ""Dunkirk"" took one of the most riveting, awe inspiring events in history and made it play out like a few guys stuck in an elevator in a burning building. ""The Darkest Hour"" carried the film goer into Churchill's drama and helped the movie goer experience it as the turning point in history it was.Now, as to the actual history, as many films do to capture the emotion referenced above, it seems to have dropped out some very important aspects of the historical event. Not being a true historian of the period, I would note it disserved the sacrifice and valor of the French army that fought and died to buy Churchill the time needed to get his army off the beach. There may have also been historical inaccuracies in how and why Churchill played out the political hand he had to work with - BUT, what I think it captures well is that Churchill was the guy who had two diametrically opposed routes, capitulate and Hitler would have governed Europe for who knows how long, or lead England into a win or die war. He insisted upon and charged full ahead into the latter and, at a minimum, saved the world from a period of Hitler ruling Europe (the level of his race genocides were not known that that time).Lastly, there is the ""what if"" historical questions that are mostly left un-inspected. It would be a whole different film, almost a sci-fi one, if they had been dealt with. What I mean is, the pacifist/peace at almost any cost people were not as wrong and/or ignorant as post war sentiment casts them. As someone noted above, the cost of going to war and defeating Hitler was financially staggering and diminished the UK to a second/third tier power after the war. Obviously the cost in lives and human terms was staggering as well. But for Hitler later veering off into genocide, would ""what if"" history have Britain looking as bad for making a deal with Germany to subsist in some form along side a unified Europe under German domination? In a historical context, how different is that history from today's ""history"" post Brexit?In my opinion this film can't be castigated for not going more into the latter two issues. Films that try to tell too many big stories almost always fail. It captured the emotion and sacrifice that led to a defining moment in history very well. And I can not say often enough how it did that very well while ""Dunkirk"" was an abject abomination on that score. It took a huge, emotionally riveting historical event and somehow made it seem small and tepid.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Good not Great,"""Darkest Hour"" 2017 is a good movie. I enjoyed it and I'm glad I saw it. I don't understand, though, the rapturous reviews it has received. For me it never transcended from ""good"" to ""great."" ""Darkest Hour"" is about noble Brits behaving heroically during World War II. It's the third movie in 2017 to feature the Dunkirk evacuation. It's one of a few films in which major stars have donned prostheses to depict Winston Churchill. In other words, there's nothing new here.Gary Oldman does a good job, but I was never able to overcome my fixation on his superb prostheses and focus on the person beneath the makeup. I think he should have done it without all that makeup so we could focus on the person, not the cosmetician's skill.The folksy, comic, and tear-jerking scenes between Churchill and his typist, played by Lily James, struck me as manipulative and a tad maudlin. James does nothing for me as an actress and for me she brought nothing but her young and pretty face to the film.Interspersed with quirky Winston, close-up-and-personal, are the politics, and the horrors, of war. Neville Chamberlin and Viscount Halifax push Churchill to reach a truce with Hitler, rather than enter into an unwinnable war.Churchill, pathetically and unsuccessfully, phones Roosevelt to beg for help. Roosevelt turns Churchill down. There were reasons Americans were slow to go to war in WW II. Main reason: the recent, pointless carnage of WW I, which was, of course, Europe's, not America's, war. Americans had been told just twenty years earlier, that they were fighting ""the war to end all wars."" Roosevelt, behind the scenes, was quietly preparing the US for inevitable war, and helping his future Allies as best he could. The phone call scene struck me as petty America-bashing.In a couple of scenes, Director Joe Wright brings the cost of war home to the viewer. In one scene, the camera is inside a field hospital with soldiers injured during the controversial Siege of Calais. The camera pans upward to plane height. A bomb is dropped. All those soldiers we had come to care about, we assume, were just killed. In another scene, a battlefield is shown from high above. It looks almost like a map. As the camera pans, we see the face of a victim of war. It's very powerful.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Outstanding Old Man,"Of course it was a rather stylised Hollywood view of what happened. 
But nonetheless it is a fact that a 65 year old Winston Churchill was handed the reigns of a war we seemed totally unprepared for hours before Germany steamrollered into Western Europe.
Churchill was certainly not popular but had warned about the evil of fascism long before Hitler revealed himself to be the monstrous tyrant he actually was.Gary Oldman of all people captured the essence of the man who took it upon himself to say NO! to appeasing the Nazi and allowing them to become overlords of Western Europe.
His performance was astonishing.Yes the tube trip was a fantasy and he was never cheered as if he was some American Quarterback or regaled with a shower of order papers.
But he gave my country hope when we had nothing to fight with and were about to lose the only professional army we had.
The pressure on this old man (pun intended) must have been unbelievable.
The other Oldman gives us a feel of what that may have been like.His relationship with his long time wartime secretary was well played by Lily James even if the timeline was flawed. And Kristin Scott Thomas was very good as Clementine.The Americans got a cursory nod which was nice to see as they were like the last war nowhere to be seen until it was nearly over so it was good that they were barely acknowledged.
It was Churchill who made it possible to achieve final victory along with our Russian allies by holding England together and imbuing us with the spirit to resist.
I knew many people who were there during those days who said as much.Churchill indeed fought with words and Gary Oldman gave us a flavour of the man and some of his many flaws. 
He was no great friend to the working man which was why he was replaced by Atlee in the 1945 election.
But as a war leader and a beacon for resistance in the first years of WW2 he probably deserved the accolade of one of the greatest men of the 20th century.This Hollywood style version has its faults but its subject is not one of them. Played with an Oscar winning panache from the last person I would ever have thought I would see in the role of Winston Churchill.
Flawed? yes. 
Sometimes Hollywood silly? yes but nonetheless a great movie about a great man.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
The Vidiot Reviews....,"Darkest HourThe only employers who have a workforce over the age of 70 are Wal-Mart and Parliament.So it's no surprise that the political party in this drama would elect a senior as its new head.Displeased with Neville Chamberlain's kowtowing to Hitler and his swelling Nazis movement, Britain's Labour Party moves to oust him as Prime Minister and replace him with a Lord from the Royal Navy, Winston Churchill (Gary Oldman).Faced with the daunting decision of either capitulating or combating the encroaching threat, Churchill not only seeks advice from his wife (Kristin Scott Thomas) and secretary (Lily James), but also the commoners.While it can get bogged down in political minutia at times, Oldman's turn as the portly Prime Minister, along with the spirited dialogue and rousing speeches, keep this reasonably accurate historical biography from becoming boring.Incidentally, the darkest hour is the best time to break and enter.

great 2hrs5minute movie,"Joe Wright , director of one of my favorite movies Atonement, directed the movie Darkest hour. The movie is about Winston Churchill and his first responsibility after becoming Prime Minister. The movie is directed very well and Gary Oldman as Winston Churchill is terrific. Interactions between Churchill and his young, timid, inexperienced typist Elizabeth Layton (good acting by Lily James) are nicely done. Gentle, loving moments of praise and scolding by wife Clemmie( terrific Kristin Scott Thomas )are directed very well. I enjoyed the movie and how difficult it was for Churchill to make decisions. Gary Oldman's acting is excellent and Oscar worthy. My favorite 2 movies of this year are great to watch on the big screen.

A brilliant lead performance in a brilliant overall movie.,"'Darkest Hour' is written by Anthony McCarten and directed by Joe Wright. It also features easily the best performance of 2017 delivered by the always great Gary Oldman as Winston Churchill. The film spans the time from Churchill's appointment as Prime Minister to his famous and powerful 'We shall fight them on the beeches' speech in the House of Commons. The cast is stellar all-round with Kristen Scott Thomas as Clementine Churchill, Lily James as Churchill's secretary Elizabeth Layton and Ben Mendelsohn as King George VI all giving remarkable performances. Then of course there is the tour de force that is Oldman at the centre of this fabulous ensemble.The movie has more accomplishments than just its performances however. The screenplay in particular is sharp as well as informative- It is very easy in a film like this for the writer to lose the audience by including excessive political and/or military strategy jargon. Instead Anthony McCarten's dialogue is coherent and engaging and drives the plot forward at a brisk pace. The great writing is coupled with inspired direction from Joe Wright and stunning cinematography courtesy of Bruno Delbonnel. The use of light and shadow, the emotion-filled close-ups and the wonderful tracking shots give the film an admirable visual splendor and grace. The production and costume design are also not to be overlooked which together give the movie a very authentic 1940's look and feel to it.For me, Gary Oldman's Churchill is as definitive as it gets up there with the likes of Daniel Day-Lewis's Lincoln and Meryl Streep's Margaret Thatcher. Thankfully he's also in one of the finest films of the year. I highly recommend 'Darkest Hour'.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

Are people that stupid?The movie itself is magnificent, well directed, well praised and no matter who wins the Oscars, Gary Oldman has given us the best performance of the year in this underrated masterpiece of a movie.In times of unrest we need men like Winston Churchill and this movie is one we need right now to remind us that you cannot reason with a tiger when your head is on its mouth.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Corny, but Feel-Good","A good, albeit slightly bland biopic about Winston Churchill & his late efforts in WWII. Gary Oldman is a little goofy in the role, but he's clearly giving it his all and definitely feels transformative in the role. The shy secretary subplot feels a bit patronizing (the only female character in the movie aside from Mrs. Churchill), and there's a weird running gag about full frontal exposure. I like the final chat with the people on the train in a vacuum, but it is a bit cheesy and disingenuous with its fabrication. It's not great, but it's pretty feel-good and certainly a comfort biopic for the holiday season.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography

The Queen may have left us, but Winston will outlive her in the country's political history. In my lively conversation as a journalist with Wright back in 2010, he mentioned his plan to continue the premise of Atonement and return to WWII. His parents were ""war children"" and knew rationing and the fear of invasion (along with the Bay of Pigs ""duck and cover"" scare), but also the kind of solidarity that rarely exists nowadays. Thirty years ago in Europe the threat of war was Yugoslavia, now all this is being played out in Ukraine. Beware the warring lunatics, they keep reappearing.

No Small Talk Here,"GRADE: B-THIS FILM IS RECOMMENDED.IN BRIEF: A solid performance by Gary Oldman makes this talky but always engrossing bio-pic work.SYNOPSIS: The first month of Winston Churchill's leadership as Prime Minister.JIM'S REVIEW: The filmed biography is an odd lot. It begins at a disadvantage from the start. Whereas a biographical novel can leisurely tell its tale with highly detailed research that spans a lifetime, the movie version usually is conventional storytelling with condensed timelines and hastily constructed dramatic flourishes, blurring facts and fiction and purporting to be true. Labeled as ""based on a true story"" is oft times misleading. Such is the case of Joe Wright's Darkest Hour, a well crafted and earnest attempt to tell the political beginnings of World War II and the early career of Sir Winston Churchill, as England's Prime Minister.An unrecognizable Gary Oldman plays an unrecognizable Churchill. (Much has been said about the astonishing resemblance of the actor to this great man. But he barely resembles the Prime Minister, no matter what others may say. Make-up and prosthetics never fully capture the likeness of the man, although they come very close at times. But the actor certainly captures the mannerisms, voice, stance, and temperament of this crusader. It's a virtuoso performance that one can easily admire.The film delves into the first month of Churchill's career as he tries to convince Parliament and his nation of the rise of Hitler and the risk of losing his beloved country to the Nazi movement. War is the only outcome in his mind and uniting his country against these forces is an uphill battle. Andrew McCarten plays fast and loose with the facts, but follows the basic outline of historical events. (Case in point: A mawkish ride on the Underground overplays the nationalistic fervor and seems very stilted and untrue, even if this scene makes its political argument and justification of the pending war.) Darkest Hour is rather talky and overtly dogmatic, with various impassioned speeches about survival and courage, amid all of the political intrigue and one-upmanship.Mr. Wright's direction remains solid, although he again relies too heavily on slo-motion techniques, long tracking shots, and never-ending aerial photography, his trademark signatures, which becomes a bit tiresome. However, he assembles a fine cast that take these stock characters and breathes life into their stereotypical roles.Kristin Scott Thomas masterfully plays his loyal wife, Clemmie, and she delivers an aristocratic elegance as his devoted spouse. Lily James is his supportive secretary, an embodiment of the English middle class and sounding board to Churchill's mood swings. Stephen Dillane and Ronald Pickup are just fine as his adversaries, Viscount Halifax and former Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain. Ben Mendelsohn, as King George VI, brings the perfect degree of trepidation and concern, always questioning the unpleasantry and motives of another equally powerful man who ruled England with him.But it is Mr. Oldman who centers the film in this showiest of role. Without his whole-hearted interpretation of a man defending his unpopular position as a war hawk during a time when the world prayed for peace, the movie could not have achieve its overall impact. Darkest Hour is a seriously minded film that contemplates the beginnings of World War II and the man who took his nation to victory.ANY COMMENTS: Please contact me at: jadepietro@rcn.com",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Not my sort of movie I'd normally watch but....,The gripping performance of the portrayal of Churchill by Gary Oldman was engrossing as well as GO being unrecognisable in his characterisation of Winston.I would say after watching this film that all action and bangs aren't necessarily the be all and end all of entertainment when such a majestic performance is in front of your eyes!,9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Winnie Come Lately,"There have been many depictions of Churchill on both the big and the small screen down the years but it seems to me that Gary Oldman's Oscar-winning performance must be one of the most successful, if not definitive of all pf them. Perhaps his voice isn't quite as deep and resonant nor his girth as rotund, but he clearly inhabits this larger-than-life character and doesn't let up until the very end. He's helped in this of course by the short time-span over which the events here play out so that the character is there full-formed ready for him to step into but he does so with such intuitive relish that you are convinced you're in the great man's considerable presence.I use that term advisedly, as of course there are revisionists afoot denigrating Churchill's reputation pointing to various flaws in his character, politics, leadership and decision-making, indeed some of these are at one point listed aloud for the viewer's consideration, but if the phrase ""cometh the hour, cometh the man"" was ever made for any individual it was surely for the right here-right now situation in which Churchill found himself at the ripe old age of 64.Yes, I found myself wondering how truthful or apocryphal some of the events shown here actually were in real life. It did seem to me as if the movie too obviously made out the appease-nik Lord Halifax as the scapegoat for Prime Minister Chamberlain's misguided policy, far more indeed than the deposed P. M. himself, whose own blackened name rises, if a little, from the ashes here too. Likewise, did King George VI really visit Churchill at the latter's home and counsel the new P. M. to gauge the will of the people before surrendering to the seemingly invincible Germans? Again this came across to me a bit as if history was being if not whitewashed, at least a little blue-washed.And finally was Churchill's mind finally made up by him taking a straw-poll amongst the working-class on an impromptu subway-train ride to Westminster, where he's helped to recall a quotation from Cicero by an artfully-placed intelligent young black man and then convinced to never surrender by a little schoolgirl. Diversity is further apparent in Lily James's unnecessarily built-up part as Churchill's secretary.Yes, there's probably some manipulation of events, with Clem Attlee for one almost completely absent from proceedings (plus I missed the exclusion of Lei Abse's famously withering condemnation ""For God's sake go!"" to Chamberlain in the Commons) and perhaps excessively so at times, but Hollywood has been taking dramatic licence with many a historical figure so why should Churchill be any different?In the end I was just about won over by the imaginative direction, period recreation and most of all the convincing acting of Oldman and Kristen Scott-Thomas as his long-suffering but long-supporting wife Clemmie. As the film shows, Churchill himself was economical with the truth when he had to be so why should this entertaining if flawed microcosm of his life be any different?",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
A Period in Uncertainty,"Churchill's predecessor, Neville Chamberlain, resigns in May 1940 because the House of Commons loses confidence in him. Winston Churchill replaces him as prime minister and promises to never surrender to Adolf Hitler. But he's isolated, and virtually no one in the House of Commons supports his position on British resistance. Additionally, British troops are marooned on Dunkirk and Calais. Can he overcome this impending doom and persuade the House of Commons to support his decision?The production design is authentic (and claustrophobic), but superior. Cinematography is beneficial (that over-head tracking shot of France (?) being bombed then revealing a dead soldier fascinates me). The supporting cast gives serviceable performances from Ben Mendelsohn as King George VI to Lily James as the loyal secretary. But, of course, the real strength is Gary Oldman's tour-de-force portray of Winston Churchill. He's determined to refuse peace negotiations with Adolf Hitler, but susceptible out of fear because he doesn't want to make mistakes. The scenes where Churchill orates over the radio and the House of Commons really shine.But, unfortunately, the scenes before these powerful speeches appear forced and unnatural, such as the scene with Churchill and the train full of passengers or when Churchill's wife (Kristin Scott Thomas) comforts him. These scenes don't feel authentic or raw, their manufactured to keep the narrative going for Churchill to fulfill his desire. Also, the director Joe Wright and screenwriter Anthony McCarten cram so much talking in this film that the movie becomes a discourse on dialogue. Other than that, the Darkest Hour is a satisfying historical drama with an Oscar winning performance from Gary Oldman.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

As long as the history is accurate ENOUGH, I do not think small details should warrant a 1/10 from some pretentious viewers. The point of the movie is to show triumph and unique leadership, not teach a history class. Some scenes gave me chills I was so moved. Oldman blew this role out of the water. While everyone knows this, I wanted to say it because his acting performance alone gives the movie the boost it needed to reach top tier.

(At this point I would like to mention, that I know that he polarised public opinion, and for as many good things that he did, there are notable, misguided decisions that he made too)Cons:
Not many really. I guess it is down to how much you are entertained by a film of this type, and how much faith you put in the historical accuracy. Remember, this is a film, and factual elements will always tend to bend to the benifit of the film's narrative, and so don't expect every scene to be historically accurate.If you like Churchill and the whole 'war hero' aspect to his character, you'll enjoy this.

Churchill on the underground,"At long last I have got round to watching this film and was encouraged by my Son( adult) opinions particularly the 'stirring ' scene on the underground.
1/ Never, ever include scenes in a dramatised documentary type film which never happened
2/ Why for PC reasons include a black passenger in the scene which was so unlikely as to be insulting to all concerned
3/ Churchill's great gift , was during 1940, to convince the British people that we could not only survive, but win .If nothing else this was his great claim to fame - not chatting with passengers on the central line to get their views. Am going on a bit about that scene but it brought the whole film down so much I couldn't enjoy any of it afterwards

A Gripping Historical Drama Anchored by Gary Oldman's Stellar Performance,"Darkest Hour is a compelling and tense historical drama that, thanks to Gary Oldman's mesmerizing performance and Joe Wright's creative direction, tells a powerful and impactful story. Without a doubt, the film's greatest strength is Gary Oldman's extraordinary acting. While Oldman doesn't perfectly resemble Churchill in appearance, his acting prowess is so commanding that the audience easily accepts him as Churchill. The film's music also aids in driving the narrative forward, effectively serving the film during moments of high tension. That said, the film cannot be considered entirely faithful to history-it is merely one perspective on the events.The film isn't completely true to history. I watched Dunkirk and Darkest Hour back-to-back over two nights. Both films depict the evacuation of Allied soldiers from the beaches of Dunkirk, but from vastly different angles. Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk focuses on the epic, heroic aspect of the event, portraying the civilian boats as a spontaneous, grassroots effort while downplaying or omitting other details. In contrast, Joe Wright's Darkest Hour approaches the event from a political perspective, highlighting Winston Churchill's role in mobilizing the civilian fleet. According to Darkest Hour, while the effort was driven by civilians, it was a coordinated military operation with an official name. I'm not here to give a history lesson, but it's worth noting that Dunkirk isn't strictly bound to historical accuracy. To truly unpack the complexities of the Dunkirk evacuation, one needs to go beyond just watching a film and engage in deeper research.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
I needed more of Queen Elizabeth.,"I liked this movie a lot. It was very funny and I really liked the transitions that it had as well. One thing I didn't like was that I felt like it was putting too much emphasis on trying to be funny. While I do know that Churchill liked to drink and he smoked but I just felt like it was too exaggerated to be true. I really like Lily James but she brought absolutely no emotion to her character. When she ""cried"" there was no emotion, no feeling at all. They just put a little droplet on her cheek and called it a day. Also I honestly doubt that Churchill was this nice of a person, he was born in the 1800's and he was British. This movie is historically inaccurate, I feel this in my bones. Also where was Queen Elizabeth? I think she needed to have a larger role in what happened in WW2.

If you are going for historical accuracy, as you cannot help but having to do here in historical record areas, then BE accurate The historical material is dramatic enough, without messing with history in some areas. That being said, it was entertaining enough. Is it an Oscar winning role for Oldman? No, for the reasons already mentioned.

The fat suit worked,"This movie works because Churchill and George VI actually look like themselves. Bad prosthetic makeup or actors that don't look like the well known public figures they are supposed to represent is something that always distracts me.

I can't decide if the scene is there to satisfy the nationalists or the politically correct. Just get rid of it, it ruins the movie big time.
Of course Gary Oldman is superb, he's been superb for decades. Imagine my surprise maybe a year earlier when I discovered he didn't have a single Oscar. Ben Mendelsohn even sounds like the King.

Great acting but a flawed concept,"I found the movie a bit slow paced, but then it's supposed to be a drama about Churchill, not a war movie.What I really found unacceptable was how bumbling they made him look.
Churchill made a lot of mistakes, but he was making huge numbers of critical decisions. They don't show him conferring with generals, and trying to get actions taken, deciding how many planes they could afford to allocate to France and how many they would need to hold back to defend England. It wasn't just Dunkirk, many of his decisions were vital to the war effort. He repeatedly tried to get the French to withdraw and keep fighting, to fight house to house in Paris, to retreat to North Africa and keep fighting. He tasked subordinates to organize the economy for war, to prioritize different kinds of equipment, to organize the home guard.Churchill was an energetic leader, and was not afraid to make decisions, even knowing that they would result in the death of a lot of people. And he was forced to make such decisions repeatedly. This is a man who had to decide to allow people in Coventry to be bombed rather than give up the secret of Ultra, and he did it.This movie makes it seem like he was just a drunk who got lucky with one idea, and that is a very unfair depiction.The acting is fantastic. Gary Oldman is terrific. And individual scenes are fine -- it's only the whole that leaves the wrong impression.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
A Movie For All Ages,"Thrilled that my 17 year old granddaughter wanted to see a movie about a man I truly respected and admired, I believe she liked it more than I did surprisingly. I know everyone is raving about Gary Oldman's performance but I could not shake off thinking of him as a psychotic killer. He usually portrays rather over the top characters. Maybe the director wanted to show Winston more as a confused old man who knows. The film had a unique stylized approach and the entire cast were excellent in complementing the film.This movie is superior to much that is put on the screen today. Seeing a well acted portrayal of King George VI made me think of an even better movie in 2010.
Cannot wait to show my granddaughter Tom Hooper's film of ""The King's Speech"" and the exceptional performance of Colin Firth.Maybe I am still mad at Gary killing wonderful Leon in ""The Professional.""",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
"""You are wise because you have doubts""","""Darkest Hour"" (2017 release; 125 min.) is a movie about Winston's Churchill's initial month in office. As the movie opens. we are reminded it is ""9 May 1940"", with the Nazi's about to run over Holland and Belgium, and the UK looking for a new leader following Chamberlain. We get to know Churchill: working from his bed, with a stiff drink, and almost scaring away his new secretary (because she typed single-spaced). While certainly not revered by his colleagues (and oven less by King George), Winston Churchill nevertheless get his lifelong dream fulfilled and is named Prime Minister on May 10th. At this point we are 10 min. into the movie but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the latest movie from British director Joe Wright, whose previous work includes the fine 2012 remake of ""Anna Karenina"". Here, working from a script by Anthony McCarten, we get a close look at Churchill in his early days as Prime Minister. The movie covers the period of May 9-28, 1940, so this by no means meant as a definitive bio-pick f the life and times of Winston Churchill, who had an amazing and long political career, spanning 5 decades. If you hope to learn anything about Churchill's personal life, then this movie is definitely not for you (his wife Clementine appears in some scenes, and their grown-up kids in exactly 1 scene). If on the other hand you are curious how Churchill ran his War Cabinet or how Churchill dealt with King George, then this movie is very much for you. I have no idea whether all of what we see on the big screen actually happened or not (did Churchill really take that subway ride to be ""among the British people""?), but the narrative is certainly there. And there there is Gary Oldman, in the role of his life as Winston Churchill. Oldman is virtually unrecognizable under all of the heavy makeup, and instead it is as if we see Churchill in the flesh. A role like this in a movie like this, is sure to generate a LOT of nominations in the upcoming awards season (Oldman was already nominated for the Golden Globes). Comments Churchill's wife at one point: ""You are wise because you have doubts"", and that about sums it up. It's apparently very lonely at the top, and riddled ith doubts. WHat a job Churchill did under the most demanding of circumstances. Last but certainly not least, as I was watching this movie, it feels like the other side of the coin to ""Dunkirk"", a very different movie obviously, but covering some of the same historical ground and facts. ""Darkest Hour"" is also far better than the weak ""Churchill"" movie from earlier this year (starring Brian Cox).""Darkest Hours"" opened on 4 screens this weekend here in Cincinnati. The Saturday early evening screening where I saw this at (in a fairly large theater) was absolutely jam-packed to the rafters, much to my surprise. Looks like there is a large appetite for this type of historical drama. I encourage you to check out ""Darkest Hour"", be it in the theater, on VOD or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusion.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

Didn't quite hit the mark for me,"Probably a bit harsh but for me the plot was a bit one dimensional and the screenplay a little (surprisingly for the plot!) played a little too much for laughs. Gary Oldman was good, but maybe all the makeup and prosthetics got in the way of a truly convincing performance. For me the standout performance was from Kristin Scott Thomas - totally convincing and emotionally involving. Having said all that, definitely worth seeing!",5.0,Anonymous,Biography
A very good movie,"Greetings from Lithuania.""Darkest Hour"" (2017) is a very good movie by all accounts. It has an amazing central performance by Gary Oldman (Oscar well earned), good and involving script, good directing and story which we all know. It was very interesting to see of how hard it must have been to this man to face a treat like that and to make a crucial decision. And with this performance Gary Oldman made me feel for this man.Overall, ""Darkest Hour"" is a very solid historical movie. It is involving, very solidly made and acted, with one exceptional performance in a lead. Very good movie overall.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Don't mess with Oldman's Churchill,"Biopics seem to be a dime a dozen nowadays, with some that are a much closer reflection of their subject matter than others. 2017's take on Winston Churchill's defining moments in 'Darkest Hour' comes across as seeming fairly accurate in its interpretation of the brash World War II era prime minister, portrayed magnificently by Gary Oldman.As the Nazi forces march across Europe, the allies are faced with a dilemma - do they stand down, or up? After a period of appeasement has clearly failed at the hands of Neville Chamberlain (Ronald Pickup), Churchill is selected by England's King George VI (Ben Mendelsohn) to serve as prime minister and steer Parliament and the British Empire toward a path to victory.What 'Hour' does particularly well is show how authentic Churchill was; a reluctant but willing soldier. The film is inextricably tied to Oldman's performance - without him, this could have been a very different end product. He has everything down to the hoarse chuckle and mannerisms, which explains why he was handed an Academy Award for the performance. But the supporting cast really does a great job not being completely eclipsed. Lily James is an especially bright star, as she portrays Churchill's trusted typist, Elizabeth, in a way that shows a range of emotions, from fear, to empathy, to pride.'Hour' is a period drama, so is not intended to feature all of the bells and whistles that big budget blockbusters are known for. Instead, it's a combination of Oldman's on point portrayal of Churchill, smart dialogue and a chilling score that are what make 'Hour' the solid film that it is.It's true that hollywood has saturated theaters with WWII-set films over the years, but 'Darkest Hour' is a good example of how there are still some gems to be found in the rough.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Gary oldman's performance was solid!,"Gary oldman is such a very well respected British actor , I liked him especially in ""Kung Fu Panda 2"" and then I wanted to see more movies of this amazing actor.Darkest hour talks about Winston Churchill's decisions in the war and how he want to protect the solider in dunkirk and how he started and how he achieved that life changing victoryGary oldman's performance was VERY good I remember listening to The real Winston Churchill's quotes and I gotta say Gary oldman NAILED it as Winston ChurchillThere's a scene I liked the most in this movie is where Winston went in the underground subway that scene was very good and very heartwarmingOverall a very good movie 7.9/10 I liked Gary oldman and I'll like him forever.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
6.6,"Not a ""must-watch"" movie, by any stretch. Rather boring, but not worth blacking out. Maybe I'm being a bit harsh, but it's not the sort of movie I'd go out on a limb to watch. People jump up and down when a movie is well directed and well-written - even if it's boring as hell. It's the insecure world we live in where people want to see themselves as ""smart and sophisticated"" rather than the drones that they are.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Great Documentary,The Darkest Hour is about Winsted ChurchI'll trying to save his island.The Darkest Hour is a great film. Writing for this film was great. It felt like it was the same thing as in real life. Stage work some of the best. For the whole film they were in a stage. They made it look so realistic. Score was a major part. The score made you feel sad and happy. Acting was some of the best. Gary Oldman transferring to look like Winston Churchill was great. He looked like the real person.The Darkest Hour was a great film. It was a little slow but it was great.,9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Great Oldman performance in a decent film,"Gary Oldman arguably gives the performance of a lifetime as Winston Churchill. It is an astonishing portrayal. He looks the part and perfectly shows the little nuances of the famous British Prime Minister. And leave it up to Edgar Wright to visually tell a story (although not as spectacular as in Atonement). But it is the story that is the weak part of the film. Sure, filmmakers often romanticize or dramatize a true story. But here quite a lot of scenes are highly dramatized. So much that they become unbelievable and damage the scenes that we dó know really happened. Most famously the metro scene near the end of the film. Watch this film for the excellent performance of Oldman. And perhaps Wright visual storytelling. That's it.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
An insult to history,"So, let's see: by the end of the 1940 spring Hitler had conquered Central Europe, while virtually all of Western Europe had surrendered to him, with America hiding behind neutrality. Only one country, Great Britain, was left a s a last stronghold of the free world and in that country one man, just one man was left to believe in victory - alone even against many of his compatriots.
Now this movie would lead us to believe that the fate of the free world was left in the hands - and saved by - a mentally impaired, physically incapacitated, trembling and stuttering, almost constantly drunk creep.
This movie is an insult to history,",1.0,Anonymous,Biography
"A mostly enjoyable, easy-to-follow biopic about one of the most important political figures of the twentieth century","Darkest Hour is a biographical war drama starring Gary Oldman as British Prime Minister Winston Churchill. Directed by Joe Wright (Atonement, Pride and Prejudice), it paints an interesting picture of the controversial but influential leader during a crucial moment in the history of Europe.In 1940, Western Europe is at war with Nazi Germany, who are on the brink of invading Belgium and the Netherlands. Meanwhile in Britain, Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain (Ronald Pickup) is forced by the Conservative Party to resign, and his successor is announced to be Winston Churchill (Gary Oldman), a man most members of parliament do not see eye-to-eye with. Churchill's unorthodox and eccentric ways of conducting politics cause much irritation among his fellow ministers, and he must now swallow his pride to decide whether to negotiate with German leader Adolf Hitler or continue to fight on.Featuring one of Gary Oldman's greatest performances, which is saying a great deal considering the many terrific roles he has played throughout his career, Darkest Hour is a mostly enjoyable, easy-to-follow biopic about one of the most important political figures of the twentieth century. The transformative makeup effects on Oldman and his perfect line delivery constantly make us feel as though we are watching the real Churchill on-screen and not some cheap imitation. Unfortunately, the film itself feels somewhat uneven at times, as it does not juggle the personal life and political life of Churchill as successfully as it should. There were moments where the film dragged due to inconsistent editing and poorly paced scenes that did not lead anywhere. However, Oldman's depiction of the celebrated world leader is fantastic enough to continue watching and thankfully counteracts most of the film's serious flaws.I rate it 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Terrific Historial Drama,"This story follows closely Christopher Nolan's "" Dunkirk"". In that film, Churchill barely makes an appearance, in ""The Darkest Hour"" Dunkirk doesn't make an appearance. Perhaps the two should be combined?Gary Oldman is sensational as Churchill. His career has some difficult moments in retrospect. Director Joe Wright circumvents this by concentrating on a few weeks, Great Britain's Darkest Hour, when Western Europe had capitulated to the Nazi war machine, the USA sat on its hands, and the British army was about to be wiped out in France.Oldman is complimented by some fine supporting, if underwritten, roles. Kirsten Scott Thomas is cruelly underused as Churchill's wife, eking the maximum out of her few minutes of screen time. As Halifax, Stephen Dillane is magnificent in a superbly oleaginous portrayal. Ben Mendelsohn develops King George V from foe to friend in quick time.The political scenes are atmospheric and terrific, the oratory a reminder of how powerful a good speech can be. Lily James is easy on the eye as Churchill's secretary, but the part feels clunky. It pulls a pretty young woman into the story, but does little else. Adie Haastrup's part as the only black face in the film feels a little contrived in the tube carriage scene which itself feels very contrived.Yet these quibbles are part of the films strength. Wright has crafted a drama out of great raw material, the two hour running time flies by.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Incredible performance by Gary Oldman!,"""Darkest Hour"" is a very well made drama film. It has great acting, especially Gary Oldman as Winston Churhcill.

Simply amazing Gary Oldman...,"""Darkest Hour"" is a Drama movie that takes us into the heart of one of the most pivotal moments of World War II: Winston Churchill's appointment as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom during the early days of the war.I enjoyed this movie because it was interesting and it focused on the intense pressure Churchill faced as he navigated the imminent threat of Nazi invasion and contemplated whether to negotiate peace with Hitler or continue fighting for freedom. The interpretation of Gary Oldman who played as Winston Churchill was simply outstanding and he succeeded on capturing the complexity of Churchill's character, from his doubts and insecurities to his moments of bold resolve. Finally, I have to say that ""Darkest Hour"" is a compelling political drama and I highly recommend everyone to watch it.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Riveting and delightful performance,"I thoroughly enjoyed the Darkest hour and didn't want it to end, I was both moving and delightful, Oldman give a brilliant and compelling performance and as I hadn't read anything before I watched I couldn't think who he was even though I kind of recognised him until the end titles told me , Many criticisms for historical inaccuracy and this maybe so but this isn't a documentary is a story and it is told extremely well, great casting characterisation , I loved every minute of it",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Gary Oldman's accent,"I'm usually not to pester about having a character casted by an actor of the same nationality. But I guess today I am. I can't fully appreciate the movie because of Mr. Oldman's fake english accent. Which is weird, because I did love him in Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy.This otherwise minor detail turned out to be quite a detail for me. But let that aside, the movie is quite great. It has a way of mixing gravewith light, serious with funny. And on a historical and political pov, it's really a great movie about Mr. CHurchill's controversial rise to prime ministry and his mandate during one of the most difficult times England has ever endured.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
