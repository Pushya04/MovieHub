"""You have to feel that Hitler was a human being; only then he is a real horror.""","The first internationally released German production to feature Hitler as a central figure, ""Downfall"" (2004) takes place in the dismal gloomy Berlin during April - May 1945 in anticipation of the inevitable German defeat. The film shows the last days of Hitler and those close to him through the eyes of his young secretary, Traudl Junge.Oliver Hirschbiegel's film has been criticized by some circles as presenting a ""too sympathetic"" portrait of the Fuhrer. I don't believe anything in the film suggests that its creators sympathize with the Nazi regime and those who had orchestrated it.Showing Hitler as a human being (amazing performance by Bruno Ganz), a man who loved his dog, was a vegetarian and could display some moments of tenderness did not undermine the overall image of a lonely, domineering, conscienceless, and hateful man who believed that his people, his compatriots, women and children deserve to die because they are no longer deserve to live and because ""in a war as such there are no civilians"".Did those who think that that the film ""humanized"" Hitler forget the most chilling scene in the movie, the one that shows Frau Goebbels crush the ampoules with cyanide between her children's teeth, after they had been dosed with a sleeping draught? She did it not because she was scared of what would happen to them after the war, no, her reason was, ""The country without National Socialism and its party is not worth living in"". How dangerous Hitler was if he could induce such a blind devotion that could convince a mother of six to murder her children in cold blood.Bernd Eichinger, the producer and scriptwriter of ""Downfall"" emphasized, the greatest danger he saw in making a film about Hitler was the temptation to show him as a psychopath or madman: ""Hitler possessed an enormous criminal and destructive energy, and he was a barbarian in the most fundamental sense of the term... But I am convinced that he was totally of sound mind until the very end, which is why leadership never slipped from his hands.""The film's director Oliver Hirschbiege says that, in the same way it was evil of Hitler to see Jews as less than human beings - i.e. as ""insects"" - it would be equally wrong to portray Hitler as a madman, because that would excuse him of culpability: ""I think the biggest mistake is to have an image of Hitler as insane - that he was not a human being but a monster. The most important point to realize is that Hitler was not a madman, not a psychopath or someone on drugs, which implies that he wasn't responsible for what he was doing. Of course he was responsible! ""For me, (this film is) paying homage to and truly honoring the victims, because we fall short if we explain the Holocaust by stating that they were all out of their minds. They knew what they were doing!""I believe that the result of their work, the film I saw last night is absolutely unforgettable - honest, powerful and devastating. It is a masterwork of film-making and a very important in its objectivity historical document.9.5/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Amazing realism,Der Untergang makes you live the horrors and craziness of war. Bruno Ganz's interpretation of Adolf Hitler is worthy of an Oscar. He is completely believable. Also the rest of the cast performs admirably. You feel transported to Berlin as it was bombarded by the Russians. You get a very clear insight (or an impression?) in how the military decisions were taken during those final days of the war. The movie balances well between large-scale effects of bombs exploding in ruined streets and depictions of different persons going though the experience  from Hitler and his staff in the well-protected bunkers to the principal military commanders torn between reason and loyalty and German civilians trapped in an inferno. The movie is neither pro-Nazi nor does it depict all Nazis as mindless monsters. It gives an impression of utter realism. Go see it in a good cinema  your seat will tremble as the bombs explode. A nine out of ten.,9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
A magnificent piece of cinema. Spectacular in every respect,"Truly great movies are few and far between these days; but Der Untergang most definitely represents one of those rare occasions. Oliver Hirschbiegel, who brought us the wonderful 'Das Experiment' has produced a film that is very nearly perfect. Depicting the final ten days of Hitler and the National Socialist regime, Der Untergang or 'The Downfall' to give it it's English title is an expose of failure and the way that a madman can bend a whole nation into doing his bidding. The film is very realistic, and an excellent ensemble cast breathe life and believability into the roles of the various members of the Nazi party and because every performance is picture perfect, the whole thing comes together brilliantly as one whole piece. Bruno Ganz gives the central performance as the Fuhrer himself and it is one of the greatest performances I've ever seen in a film. His portrayal of Hitler in the middle of his downfall is absolutely perfect, and Ganz excellently portrays the man's every emotion. It must be difficult to play such a notorious character as Hitler himself, but Ganz rises to the occasion and gives it his all.It is not the acting or the realism that is Der Untergang's main claim to greatness, however - it's the double meaning behind every scene. Each one is perfectly composed, and all the time you're watching you can not only see what's happening on screen but also take note of the implications surrounding it. Through every scene, there's always the notion that a nation is falling. That's another thing that's great about this movie - the way that it manipulates the audience into an awkward situation. On the one hand, we know that Hitler and the Nazi regime were unspeakably evil; but while we're watching this almost great nation crumble around it's leader, it is hard to watch without feeling some sympathy for the country, in spite of the ideals that were preached. I thought it would be impossible to generate feelings for the Nazi's; but Der Untergang has managed even that. 'The Downfall' is an apt title for this movie, as aside from depicting an important event in history; the film is fundamentally about failure. The entire movie focuses on one man's huge downfall, and it is both a heartbreaking and powerful cinematic experience. Der Untergang is not to be missed.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
"The Most Impressive, Depressive and Realistic Dramatic Movie about the World War II","""Der Untergang"" is certainly the most impressive, depressive and realistic dramatic movie about the World War II ever made. I have never seen a film picturing the insanity of Hitler in his very last days in a bunker in Berlin with his high command, and how the German people were hypnotized by him like in this film. Last year, I saw the deceptive, boring, pretentious and overrated ""Molokh"", showing a caricature of Hitler and Eva Braun in Bavaria. But ""Der Untergang"" is awesome and comparable to ""Apocalypse Now!"", my favorite movie of war.Two years ago, I saw the powerful ""Das Experiment"" and I was impressed with the work of Oliver Hirschbiegel. With ""Der Untergang"", this director is certainly included in my list of favorite directors. It is difficult to highlight one actor or actress in this constellation of stars, but I was impressed with the performance of Bruno Ganz and his ""human"" Hitler, totally different from the stereotypes usual in other movies. The cinematography and the battles are stunning, and the scenario of Berlin completely destroyed recalled the neo-realistic movie of Roberto Rossellini ""Germania Anno Zero"".For those who know Germany and German people, it is amazing to see how this wonderful country survived to the chaos, destruction and lack of command, arrived from the ashes like Phoenix and sixty years later is again one of the greatest nations. For those who might have believed in Hitler and his Nazi Party, it is impressive to see how people is forgotten and treated without compassion by their leader in his last hours. And for those who love war, I really recommend to watch this magnificent anti-war movie, and see the behavior of the leaders and population when a war is lost. My vote is ten.Title (Brazil): ""A Queda! As Últimas Horas de Hitler"" (""The Fall! The Last Hours of Hitler"")",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
A truer rendition of Hitler I've never seen...,"Not since perhaps Rod Steiger's portrayal of Benito Mussolini in Moustapha Akkad's LION OF THE DESERT (1980) have I seen a notorious dictator more realistically acted than Bruno Ganz's stunning display as ""Der Fuerer"" in The Downfall (2004).Sitting amongst a full-house of patrons here at the Toronto Int'l Film Festival's 2004 edition, Ganz captivated the local audience with the scariest Hitler I've ever seen up on the silver screen -- better than Noah Taylor's English Hitler in MAX just a couple of years back.Audience members get a glimpse into the final days of Hitler's rule from the bunker deep beneath the Reich Chancellery in Nazi Berlin's dying days. The defeated spirit of the Nazis -- covered extensively in the history books -- has seldomly been more penetratingly shown on the Big Screen. Bravo to director Oliver Hirschbiegel for doing this the right (German) way -- for intrepidly tackling a period piece few German producers might.I'd had a chance to chat with the actors post-screening, with lead actress Alexandra Maria Lara (playing Traudl Junge) candidly admitting the sheer amount of work she'd diligently invested in bringing her character to life -- doubtless complicated by the death of Frau Junge in 2002. Her research, however, was clearly impeccable and left no stone unturned. Corinna Harfouch wasn't on hand -- as Magda Goebbels. Pity because in many respects, she convincingly stole the show.So rarely do we see Hitler on screen in modern days to allow us a glimpse into the horrifying nature of a madman bent on global domination. We all know the end of this story, but seldom does a film so masterfully suspend your disbelief than does The Downfall in making you wonder just how the Third Reich might end. Historical fiction might never be the same.",,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Distanced and sober view of Hitler's last days,"The first 15 minutes made me doubt the qualities of this movie. The situations were a bit forced and the cuts were strange. But after the uncomfortable beginning the movie took momentum and kept it until the end.I think the choice of depicting Hitler as a human being with a dispassionate and modest direction was excellent. The film never tries to force viewers into an opinion. Everybody can form his own opinion. Too often the horrors of WWII led writers and directors to depict Nazis as monsters. Perfectly normal human beings can be cruel and merciless if they are blinded (by hate for example), which should never be forgotten.In a way, a human Hitler to me is more guilty than a raving monster. He had the choice and he chose to do wrong. He could choose life and he chose murder and destruction. A human being lost respect for the life of other human beings and led a country into genocide. Ultimately he loses respect for all life and starts sacrificing his own soldiers at random. This is what I value this film for, making the idea of a human Hitler tangible.It was very brave to make this film, given that controversy was almost certain to arise. One of the highlights of this year, to be sure.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
The End,"Now here is a novel idea, making a movie from the ""enemy's"" point of view, attaching a human face to probably the most notorious institute of evil in human history. Before watching this film, I had reservations over how much I would enjoy it and what I might gain from it. I was concerned that the film may be an attempt to show the human side of the Nazi party, to make us sympathetic not to their cause, but to their human nature. I had to think to myself, do I really want to attach a human element to people who history has painted as monsters? The film begins with Hitler recruiting Traudl Junge as a new secretary in 1942, from this point onwards the film is predominantly (but not entirely) seen through her eyes. This key scene at the beginning of the film shows how people reacted to their leader with fanatical loyalty, holding him high in reverence. This gives us a brief insight into the belief of his followers that what they were doing would lead them to a golden utopia, a better world. All to often in films concerning Nazi's, they are portrayed as evil personified, killing for killing's sake, being evil for the sake of being evil. What we get throughout this film is a more realistic viewpoint of people's attitudes. The people who followed Hitler may have no entirely agreed with everything he said, may have not hung on his every word, but believed that he would lead them to a greater future, as such they followed.Bruno Ganz, does a magnificent job of playing one of history's most notorious and documented individuals. He plays the role as, what I feel, accurately and realistically as possible. He resists the temptation to play Hitler as an uber-evil super-villain, disregarding all life who opposes him and wiping out humans at a whim. He plays the roles as an ageing leader, loosing grip on his health, his sanity and his conquest. A man who was kind, considerate and caring to children, his dog and his civilian staff, but who also attempted to wipe out an entire race of people and was proud of himself for doing it. It shows a man willing to send young children into the street to resist enemy advancement, it shows a man who believes that the civilian population would not be evacuated, as it was their chance to rise up (women and children, the old and sick, un armed) and prove they deserved victory. This film raises the question, was Hitler an evil man who practised evil deeds through his beliefs? or were his evil deeds a result of his absolute pursuit of his beliefs? Watching Ganz's performance, you get the feeling all Hitler had left before he took his life, was his ideals (not that this is anything to be proud of). He had lost the war, he had lost the respect of several of his commanding officers and he had lost his grip on reality.The film also shows Hitler's closest officers and staff, it shows how they react to the downfall. Some have blind and fanatical faith that Hitler will act as their saviour and devise a scheme to turn the battle around. Some accept that their leader has lost his grip, but follow with blind devotion anyway. Some are not so sure and see the cracks in the beliefs they were fighting for. The film shows these often horrifying moments and realisations in all to realistic detail.Ultimately, Downfall shows the human and personal element of the end of the war for Hitler and the Nazis. It shows how real people, people who tell jokes, drink, socialise, listen to songs and dance, also followed national socialism with a devotion that drove them to do the terrible things they did. It shows how they did not believe what they were doing was wrong, in their minds they were paving the way for their glorious future. It also shows their fanatical devotion and blind faith in their goal, led to their downfall, both as a movement and as human beings.Downfall is an amazing and powerful film, documenting an unseen side of a major historical event. The film ends with video footage of the real Traudl Junge talking about her feelings towards the war and he involvement with the Nazis. She says that when she first became involved with the Nazis, she was in awe of their power and beliefs, she may have not agreed with everything they did, but what difference would her being involved or not make? She was ignorant to their deeds and as such held a clean conscience. Then she says has realised over time she had the power not to be ignorant to their deeds, that she should have stayed away from them, realising them for the evil that they were. I felt she was warning what ignorance can lead to, that no matter how tiny one person is in the scheme of things, it is no excuse to contribute towards the wrong cause.Excellent historical film, highly recommended.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Important and controversial,"Although it's a good film, it was just as interesting to read the comments  especially from Germany. It's true, whenever a film such as this comes out portraying the Third Reich not as an Indiana Jones-type Empire of Evil, we Germans turn around in advance protesting: ""This is not meant to justify anything! Of course Hitler was a monster!"" I don't think anyone seriously judges young Germans today by what their great-grandparents did, but it's of course something never to be forgotten. Sadly, it's also a convenient stereotype in politics and movie-making that tends show demons instead of humans, with the effect that we no longer understand just how on earth such things were possible. Hopefully it will take a very long time before the Nazis are surpassed in evil. But closing our eyes to the real Hitler, Stalin or Mao and their minions in favor of a legend will prevent us from ever understanding how these things work. ""If you look into the Abyss, it looks back into you"" (Nietzsche?). Movies like this one challenge the viewer's ability to look and do some honest self-reflection, or we all might wake up one day to the same bad realization, that we chased a dream and killed millions along the way.""The Downfall"" suggests how hard it was to be an outsider and not be affected by Nazi propaganda, and how well Hitler had managed to brainwash his troupe, especially the SS, into believing Germany was to be Sparta reincarnated, whose code of honor called upon everyone to fight to the death and without mercy. He ruled his admirers by being the source of their ideals (read: delusions of grandeur), pride, hope and fear. Bruno Ganz has justly been praised for his performance, and what he did was just enough  to make Hitler more mesmerizing as well as menacing would have invited unnecessary criticism. But imagine for once Anthony Hopkins in that role  the outcries of indignation! And the stacks of fan letters ...! (Hopkins actually played Hitler on TV in dark pre-Lecter times.) This Hitler is rather funny in his spitting and raving.I was often annoyed by the kitschy music when suffering civilians and wounded are shown  scenes like these are stronger without it  and also by the urge to show ""good"" Germans, in the moral sense of the word. Not one of them, except the SS commandos hanging ""traitors"" in the streets, is fanatic enough to be entirely unsympathetic. There are some really memorable quotes by Hitler which serve as historical cues: ""Mercy is a crime against the people"" is the most remarkable. Juliane Köhler is striking as Eva Braun  she speaks volumes with her eyes, as is Magda Goebbels (Corinna Harfouch) who kills her children in cold blood (and allegedly had a thing for Hitler, but that's subtle in the film)  the ""bravest mother of the Third Reich"" indeed, by Hitler's standards! Joseph Goebbels, apart from a superficial resemblance, remains bland and not half the intellectual, charismatic orator he really was, and the rest of the cast is not particularly impressive either. The film's atmospheric moments are inside the bunker, when a grenade hits and suddenly the wild merriment stops, and you feel a claustrophobia and sense of dread that makes the goings-on seem like a mad fever dream. That was when I felt the fiction was real.Some commentators have called this the best WW2-movie they ever saw. It's maybe the most complex recent ""big screen"" issue about Germany's Hitler madness  so far. My ""favorite"" is a Russian film (I can't recall the title) that shows what Germans  and Russians  did on the Eastern front, mostly seen through the eyes of a Russian boy whose village is burned down with its inhabitants locked inside the church, to which the SS set fire. Though not as grisly in detail as ""Saving Private Ryan"", it depicts the events Hitler's ""table talk"" set into motion in all their bestiality and without all false sentimentality. We should not forget that most of the war victims besides Jews were Russians, and for the latter the killing was far from over after 1945. They have their own story about killing for ideology or conformity that I'd really like to see made into a film as challenging as this one.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
A Contrary View: This film is a failure,"If the goal of the director was to give us an accurate portrait of Adolf Hitler then this well acted film is a failure.Nowhere in the movie is the true evil of Nazism presented. There is a mention or two from Hitler about cleansing Europe of the Jews, but that's it. We don't see Hitler the madman; we see Hitler as a delusional commander in chief who has occasional temper tantrums. The conflict is between contending armies, not of Good and Evil. Hitler is portrayed as a feeble leader compelled to accept the inevitable--not as the Satanic psychopath directly responsible for the deaths of tens of millions. A visitor from Mars (or one of our blissfully ignorant recent high school graduates) could watch this movies and never know about the willful murder of six million men, women and children.Critics argued that this account of Hitler was too respectful, and they were correct. The death scene is a prime example: we are not shown the body of Hitler with the top of his head blown out ""out of respect.""There is another flaw: too many anti-climaxes. Some are inexplicable. For example, at mid point of the film, Hitler says everything is lost and tells his advisors to ""do what you want."" He then is shown fondling the cyanide capsules and telling Eva the best way to point the pistol. But then a few scenes later, he is vigorously prosecuting the war and forbidding any talk of surrender.Yes, well acted. But ""realism"" means more than gritty scenes of war mayhem. The true evil of Hitler and his followers does not come across. The film is NOT ""realistic"" in that sense.",5.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
The Best WWII movie ever.,"'Der Untergang' is probably the only WW2 movie I've ever seen, which only deals with facts and is utterly deprived of any form of commercialism whatsoever. Bruno Ganz is truly excellent in his role as Adolf Hitler, a tired man who sees his ""Reich"" fall, but cannot accept it. Overall (type)casting is very good; all the actors chosen to portray a famous/notorious character look a lot like the real deal, especially Goebbels. Although I'm not a fan of long war movies, these 2,5 hours passed very quickly due to excellent acting, great sets, FX and storyline. Somehow, every scene is dripping with underlying tension that never really explodes; a kind of unsettling unbelieved grips you when you see seemingly ordinary people commit astonishing atrocities and sins towards mankind, just for their faith and loyalty to one man, Hitler, who himself walks the edge of reason.Great movie : 10/10 without a doubt.",,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
This movie has physically touched me! ....wow.,"I don't know what to say about this film. I am almost speechless.First of all, this is almost PERFECT cinema, beautifully shot, acted, lit, staged and on and on. BUt it is also the only film in recent memory that had an almost physical impact on me. I left feeling disoriented and very disquieted, a feeling that lasted for several hours.What we have here is an exercise in patience. A film that allows us to watch the disintegration of the largest empire in modern history, from the inside out. Beginning after the start of the siege of Berlin, the bulk of the film takes place in the cramped bunkers below the city, where Hitler and his officers are trapped like rats on a sinking ship, aware of their fate, but not smart enough, not willing enough, or maybe incapable of escaping the fates they created for themselves.This is a daring, brilliant film with a virtuoso performance by Bruno Ganz as Hitler. He shows us that beneath the genocidal, world changing shell of hatred that the globe knew, Hitler was still that petty, hatefilled, failed art-student that he was before becoming the greatest villain in history.awesome, awesome, awesome movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
An excellent rendition reflecting historiographical trends of the past years.,"""Der Untergang"" (""The Downfall"") portrays life inside (and to an extent outside) the ""Führerbunker"" in Berlin during the last few weeks prior to Hitler's suicide in April, 1945. The screenplay was written by Bernd Eichinger, who has had previous experience with the adaptation of historical material for cinema, and done a commendable job in the process. I am, of course, referring to his screen version of Umberto Ecco's historical novel ""The Name of the Rose (1986). Some of Eichinger's other credits include ""Body of Evidence"" (1993, which he co-produced) and ""The NeverEnding Story"" (1984, as producer).Few movies have stirred up as much controversy even before their release, as has ""Der Untergang."" So what was all the fuss about, and was it warranted? After all, how many films have been made about Hitler already, including several about Hitler in his Berlin bunker. There is nothing especially controversial about the subject matter per se. What is more, Hirschbiegel and Eichinger appear to have done their homework, basing the film extensively on German historian Joachim Fest's acclaimed book of the same name (2003). Events are portrayed largely through the eyes of Traudl Junge, Hitler's private secretary from 1943when the film opens with a flashback sequence to her job interview and appointmentto his death. Her memoirs, and interviews conducted before her death, constitute a further source for the film. The Führer himself is played magisterially by Bruno Ganz, who clearly spent countless hours studying Hitler's public speeches, as well as rare footage of the private man, not to mention recordings of his voice. For a historian like myself, who has viewed and listened to much of the material myself, it is uncanny how right Ganz gets it. Inflection, tonality, accentthey are all there. As are gestures and body language. This film has to be seen in the original, even if you don't understand German.So if there is little in the way of subject matter, preparation, historical consulting, and prime acting to fault, why then the controversy? The approach and interpretation were at the root of the hullabaloo. Interviewed while the film was in the making, Eichinger explained that he would portray Hitler ""as a man, as a human"" (""wie ein Mensch."") This was revolutionary in cinema, where renditions of the Nazi leader havepre-Eichingerstill not gone far beyond the ""evil-dictator"" approach. You might reasonably query what is wrong with the ""evil dictator"" approach, given the accepted fact that he was, indeed, evil. From a historian's perspective, everything is wrong with that approach, and Eichinger had the courage to transcend it for the broad public.The first two decades of post-World War II historians pretty much demonized Hitler, as did all movies before ""Der Untergang."" This was understandable, at the time. Wounds were still fresh, denazification was under way, Germans were seeking a new democratic identity aligned with the West, and the issue of ""collective guilt"" was touchy. Solid, balanced biographies of Hitler had not yet been written, and historical understanding of how it was possible that a highly cultured people such as the Germans could have been led astray was only just beginning to take shape. But with the 1964 revision of Lord Alan Bullock's ""A Study in Tyranny"" (1st ed. 1952) and Joachim Fest's ""Hitler: Eine Biographie"" (1973) professional historians started putting demonetization to rest and instead began to explain. And this meant accepting the perhaps distasteful tenet that Hitler was, after all, a man, and not some kind of deranged satanic figure from hell. Sir Ian Kershaw, Professor of Modern History at the University of Sheffield, has taken things even further, in his highly accessible two-volume (2000 page!) magnum opus which has now become the standard biography (published 1998-2000). For Kershaw has not only reconciled the internationalist (or ""Hitler-centric"") approach, which focuses on Hitler as linchpin and leader of the Third Reich, without whom World War II and the Holocaust are unthinkable; with the structuralist approach, which links Hitler and his ""enabling"" to social, political and cultural structures in Weimar Germany. Kershaw has also gone a long way towards meeting the desideratum of German historian Martin Broszat, uttered as far back as the 1970s, for the ""historicization"" of Third Reich history, meaning its firm embedding in overall German, European, and indeed World History, rather than its artificial isolation as an ""aberration"" or a ""German special path"" (""deutscher Sonderweg."") This, then, is the proper historiographical context of ""Der Untergang."" In effect, the film almost belatedly follows trends in scholarship that have been developing for some time now. Of course, the general public is hardly aware of such developments. So in a sense, the film is something of a vulgarization, a kind of dramatization informed by the best scholarship. The film does not explain, for it is, after all, not a documentary with the voice-over of a historical consultant cum narrator. That is not its purpose. What it does, however, is provide an excellent sense of Hitler in his declining days, increasingly delusional if perhaps not outright insane, but still ablealmost to the bitter endto maintain a hold on his closest followers. Not to mention the unreality of life in the sheltered bunker, while outside the Russians are advancing through Berlin suburbs, held back only by a pathetic hodge-podge of Hitler youth and tired old men drafted into service in the Volkswehr. From all accounts I have read, from the pens of scholars English, American and German, I can say with a high degree of certitude that this film provides a reasonably authentic recreation of what it must have been like. Or in the words of Leopold von Ranke, ""wie es eigentlich gewesen."" What higher acclaim can a historian provide?",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
One of the Best Movies I've Ever Watched,"Seriously, I wasn't expecting much, but this was one of the best movies period. The actors and acting was terrific, the sets were incredible (St. Petersburg, Russia), the emotions... I felt like I was in Berlin during the last few days, I felt like I was in the bunker with Hitler. It is the most realistic depiction of the situation I had ever seen, and I almost felt a tear in my eye. And that is something, coming from a 40 year old Army veteran. The last 5 minutes, I was on the edge of my seat, when the Russians showed up. Anyway, this movie is totally recommended by me, but brush up on your Nazi history first, or you won't know who is who.I also liked it because it showed Hitler as a real human, and not the usual Anthony Hopkins/Alec Guiness ""nutbag"" Hitler, or the stereotypical ""demon"" Hitler. It showed him as he was, a broken down egomaniac. I will totally buy this movie and add it to my collection, which is rare for me to do these days.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Impressive,"Considering the fact how hard it is to make an adequate movie about the  Third Rich and especially Hitler himself, ""Der Untergang"" is a superb  portrayal of the last days of Hitler, his minions and the Third Rich.  First of all, Bruno Ganz' performance is magnificent, brilliant,  perfect. You're beginning to think he IS the Fuehrer, his look, his  mannerism, his sick philosophy of life and his downfall are absolutely convincing. After seeing him you can finally understand why  so many people back then were attracted by his charisma, but thanks to  Ganz' performance you do not forget about the terrible crimes he  committed by his followers and about the evil inside the sick soul of  this man. His minions weren't that important in this movie, except for  Joseph Goebbels and his family. Heinrich Himmler, the ReichsfuehrerSS,  was portrayed as the man he was: an idiotic coward, who was in great  part responsible for the Holocaust and still believed in a peace  agreement with the allied forces, although this idea was completely out  of place. Albert Speer as one of the less criminal national socialists  was also quite good interpreted. Martin Bormann, Alfred Jodl and  Wilhelm Keitel, 3 other important Nazis, got too few screen time, and  Hermann Goering didn't even show up, he was just mentioned. I think  Goebbels wasn't portrayed that authentic as he could have, due to the  fact he was the most intelligent of Hitler's inner circle, but in some  scenes he seemed like someone who could just repeat his own slogans.  The part about Traudl Junge and the boy from the Volkssturm, Peter, was  also quite good, but it was clearly overshadowed by the Hitler/ minion  part. There are also some surprisingly well done battle- sequences  taking place in Berlin, in which you can also see a part of the pretty  high amount of blood and violence, for example when a soldier gets shot  through his head, some officers are committing suicide or the killing  of the Goebbels children, a scene which gave me the chills. Due to it's  high authenticity, great actors and an important message, this movie  could become as important as Schindler's List already is, in order to  show today's youth the insanity of Hitler and the whole Third Rich and  to make them avoid racist and extreme right wing organisations. All in  all, this is one of the best German flicks I've ever seen - although  there isn't such a huge number of good German movies. 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

Every time I watch good movie about WWII I change my mood in depressive or something like that. After watching it I spent few hours thinking about that maybe most important period in history.

Very important historically but not for the faint of heart,"This film is based on the experiences of Hitler's secretary as well as other survivors of the bunker during the final days of Nazi Germany. It follows these people (with a strong emphasis on Hitler through the first 80% of the film) and excels at its historical accuracy. Unlike some of the other Hitler biopics (such as the ones starring Richard Basehart and Alec Guinness), this one shows an odd and 3-dimensional man--screaming and irrational one moment yet rather kind and likable the next. If Hitler had ONLY been a screaming madman (as he's generally shown) no one would have followed him and he never would have led Nazi Germany. Here he is much more believable and the writer, director and actor (Bruno Ganz) all created the best screen Hitler to date.The film is a history teacher's dream come true, as the film sure makes you THINK it's being filmed in Berlin during the final days. The look of the bombed out and burned out city is amazing, the bunker sure looks like what the real bunker would have looked like, the uniforms, weapons, cars, etc. all look as they should.I have only one reservation about this incredibly well made film and that is although the film often sanitized the violence here and there, other times it's up close and personal and overwhelming. For example, many times folks blow their brains out with pistols. You often only hear it and you might see a brief look at the corpse. But, other times, with little warning, someone whips out their pistol and blows a hole through their head...and you see all of it. And, the death of the Goebbels children is heart-wrenching to watch. There also are the scenes involving amputations that are hard to watch. So, while I applaud the film for accuracy, it it NOT for small children or anyone who isn't prepared to see exactly how it was...blood and all.Overall, incredibly compelling and a film that's among the best the Germans have ever made. Ironically, Ganz played Hitler in this one and his other super-famous film was WINGS OF DESIRE in which he played an angel!!",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
A train wreck in slow motion.,"'Downfall (2004)' focuses on the final days of WWII as seen through the eyes of those closest to Adolf Hitler, who seems to lose what little sanity he has as he hides away among thick walls of his underground bunker. There isn't really a protagonist, per se. Instead, the piece moves between a few key characters to craft a relatively all-encompassing account of its events. It's not like you 'root' for any of the characters; most of them are Nazis, after all. Instead, you watch the eponymous downfall with a morbid curiosity. It's like watching a train wreck in slow motion: the destruction is inevitable but the process is oddly compelling. The only people you really feel sorry for are the civilians. Innocent people are needlessly killed, caught in the cross-fire during the siege of Berlin, and even the German army is wasted on suicide missions that no-one in their right mind would go through with. That's just the thing, though; Hitler isn't in his right mind. His stubborn unwillingness to surrender belies his delusional state, while his open contempt for his own people belies the fact that he never really cared about his country. Bruno Ganz's portrayal is incredibly effective, displaying a dynamic range and an unwillingness to allow his despicable character to become a cartoonish monster. The movie doesn't take the easy route of portraying Hitler as some sort of bogeyman. Instead, it goes out of its way to portray him as human, forcing you to consolidate the fact that you and he somehow belong to the same species. It's this that the affair is most remembered for. However, its derailment continues well after Hitler's death. Once their leader abandons them, the Nazis that remain must decide how - and, indeed, if - to proceed. Here, the piece hammers home just how indoctrinated many members truly were, refusing to move past their final orders or imagine a life for their families in a world without Nazism. Frankly, it boggles the mind. There are a few who come to understand the atrocities that were happening around them, things that they were blind to before. Does ignorance beget forgiveness? The movie's real-life interview with Traudl Junge, Hitler's final secretary and the author of one of two books the feature is based on, seeks to go some way in answering this. It's just one of the thematic queries that the affair deals with. Indeed, there are lessons to be learned here. Though most of those ought to have soaked into the worldwide consciousness already, the flick's 'insider' perspective does a good job of emphasising them. It delves into a difficult and often undocumented aspect of one of the worst periods in memory. It's as informative as any history lesson, yet it's done in an atmospheric and mostly compelling way. Because it lacks traditional characters and isn't really concerned with empathy in the way movies usually are, it can sometimes be a little less compelling than you'd expect. It's interesting, yet a little dry. Having said that, it occasionally springs to life and grips in a deeper way. It isn't enjoyable but it is engaging. It's definitely worth watching. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Dr. Feelgood,"Usually I don't write a comment. Especially not when it's a good movie, because everybody sees something slightly else in it. But since I'm quite outraged about this one, I needed to write something. Hitler with human traits, sure I can see that. Fair enough, this makes it all the more worrying, if he's human, we all are able to make the same horrific mistakes. Great acting performances by basically everyone. No problem there. But.... Hitler and Goebbels are the two rotten apples in the basket the movie seems to be telling us. And Goebbels (the brilliant intellectual who re-invented propaganda) is depicted as a loyal moron dog. Ein ""voll-idiot"" as they may say in German. The rest of the bunker crowd are either loyal but stupid, or realists who have cowardice as their biggest vice. The last ones are all depicted as people who want to talk some sense in this raving megalomaniac, as people who want to save the German population, but in the end were not able to stand up against big uncle Adolf. They meant so well after all.... To me, it came across as a feel-good movie, there were 2 madman (and a couple of loyal wives and secretaries), but the rest wasn't so bad after all, really. We can all go to bed safely now. Sure, a lot of Germans (most probably, in fact)were not responsible for the atrocities that went on, but to claim the same for the bunker crowd is stretching it. They too were human, bound to make mistakes, yes, but here most of them are almost angel material, cowardly angels, stupid angels, but nevertheless...........a sad, very sad story indeed....",4.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Highly recommended,"I'm not normally one to go for historic movies but, being of German origin and born 10 years after the end of the 2nd World War, I thought I'd have a look at it. And boy, did it knock my socks off! Having always been a dedicated anti-fascist with a left-wing past, I never imagined that I could be moved by the events and problems within the factions of Hitler's cronies, military personnel or ministers. But moved I was and I found it almost impossible to watch the last scene with Goebbels' children... The performance by Bruno Ganz as Hitler is awesome and would've deserved an Oscar in my opinion and the atmosphere created in the movie is haunting. No other movie has made such an impression on me in the last couple of decades. Highly recommended.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
DOWNFALL is essential and indispensable watching  for outstanding performance by Bruno Ganz,"The film deals with the history of Hitler's last days in underground bunker , it's the true story of the historic downfall and death (at age 55 in 1945) of the infamous Nazi dictator's culprit of death of 50 million people during second war world and killing of 6 million Jewish in concentration camps . The Fuhrer's last few tortured days in his underground bunker against a Berlin background . Hitler had height five feet , seven inches , eyes black , hair black , shaggy locks hung over forehead , complexion sallow , wide mustache , various hairs on each side ; besides he had marked devotion to brown shirts and old trench-coat and always surrounded by armed thugs and expert gunmen . He had demented gaze with tendency to become hysterical on slight provocation with delusions , particularly upon his place in history and his powers over vast numbers of people and addicted to public hysteria on race purity , and known to throw himself on the floor and gnaw rugs, guttural voice apt to rise to shrill tones when excited or thwarted . He was a congenital liar suffering from dreams of persecution . Almost all these physical descriptions and particulars of Hitler are perfectly incarnated by Bruno Ganz who even studied Parkinson's disease patients in a Swiss hospital to prepare for his role . Thus , he magnificently plays him as a sadistic , malicious , dangerous , vengeful, mystical and maniacal man .Bruno Ganz's portrayal is the perfection in the Hitler role one would expect at least on the surface , he gives insight to his madness and with persuasive qualities of his interpretation . A flawless casting with excellent German actors such as Alexandra Maria Lara (personal secretary Traudl Junge and the picture is based on his book) as co-protagonist , Juliane Kohler (Eva Braun) and distinguished players as Ulrich Matthes (Joseph Goebbles) , Corinna Harfouch (Magda Goebbles) and Thomas Kretschman . Besides , a nice support cast who play to famous characters as Martin Borman , Alber Speer , General Keitel , General Jodl and Hermann Goering and specially Heimrich Himmler who will betray to Hitler deciding along with the count Bernardotte to agree peace with the Allies , originating his hysteria splendidly reflected in the movie . In spite of Berlin is surrounded and meanwhile the bloody war with enormous bombing fall about the survivors and last defending , Hitler prepares the sad farewell very well narrated by the director Oliver Hirschbiegel and superbly captured the atmosphere by the cameras . The motion picture is one of the best war movies ever made , on pair with ¨Das Boot (also German movie and directed by Wolfgang Petersen) and ¨Saving private Ryan¨ (Steven Spielberg) . The flick will appeal to historical cinema enthusiasts and warlike genre fans. Rating : Above average and astounding , being interesting and thoughtful .",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
"It's amazing and unbelievably realistic... Go see it people, NOW!!!","Having a huge interest in both World Wars and all that happened during the time period 1910-1950, I've seen a lot of movies and read even more books on the subject. Name me a more or less realistic war movie and I've probably seen it, so when ""Der Untergang"" was first released in Germany, I already knew I wanted to watch it as soon as it would be released over here. The commotion that it caused, the good critics that it got, all made me look forward to the day that I would see it, but really nothing could prepare me for what I saw... It was amazing, it was great, it was jaw-dropping...The main criticism that many people had on this movie was that Hitler and the other Nazi party members looked too human. I know, some people expect that the leaders of the Third Reich are only shown as real monsters, as people who didn't have any human feelings... But that's not the truth. The truth is that, no matter how horrible the things they did, they still were human and (most of the time) acted like normal human beings (for instance Hitler who really loved his German shepherd or who had one of Goebbels' children sitting on his lap while they were singing a song for him...). And let's be honest: do you think a leader who doesn't care for his people's destiny after the war, who doesn't want to see the truth that the war is lost, who knows all too well that he sends young children into battle (he even decorates them personally), but doesn't care, a man who can be so kind and sweet one moment and than be furious and outraged the other moment, really looks like a kind, sweet grandfather??? I don't think so. The makers of this movie never intended to make him look like a nice or a bad man, they intended to show him the way he really was and they did an amazing job.I've seen many documentaries about Hitler and read a lot of books about the man, so I think I can say I know quite well how he acted and reacted. Seeing Bruno Ganz as Hitler was a shock. He doesn't just look like Hitler, he IS Hitler in this movie!!! His performance was absolutely amazing and seeing him in this film really made shivers going down my spine. Hitler seemed to be alive again! If you've read so many books about the man as I did, you can only conclude that the resemblance is more than just remarkable, it is perfect.But of course there were more actors in the movie than Bruno Ganz (an actor who I admire since I saw ""Pane e Tulipani"" or ""Bread and Tulips"" for the first time). Even though I have to admit that I don't really know any of them, I must say that they all did an excellent job. Juliane Köhler as Eva Brown, Corinna Harfouch as Magda Goebbels, Alexandra Maria Lara as Traudl Junge, Ulrich Matthes as Joseph Goebbels,... They all must have studied there characters for many hours, because they were all excellent.As the horror and reality of the movie have only just ended and burned themselves on your retina for the rest of your life (By the end of the movie, you'll have seen many officers commit suicide, Hitler and Eva Brown being burned behind the bunker, the Goebbels murdering their children, people being hanged on a lantern for stupid reasons, young children dying as they try to defend Berlin...), you think you've had it all, but than the real Traudl Junge gives away a last testimony, looking back on her life with Hitler ... blowing you away even more. I can't remember that I've ever been so quiet after seeing a movie and apparently I wasn't the only one. Really no-one spoke a word during the first minutes after the lights went on again. I don't think many movies have ever touched the audience in such a deep way as this one did.Because of its historical value and realism, this movie should be seen by everybody and especially by young people at school. Forget those history books for once, this will get through to them at least ten times better. I'm sure that everybody will admit that this movie is a true masterpiece. People who don't know anything about the subject will be able to learn a lot about it and people who already thought they knew it all will still find some new things and will admit that this is exactly the way it must have been 60 years ago. I think there can be only one appropriate score for this movie and that is a full 10/10. Go see it people, NOW!!!",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Interesting Perspective,"While this movie wasn't exceptionally flashy or stylistic, its pretty unique in the cannon of ""Nazi films"". As an under-informed American, these facts and this perspective were new to me, even as some one that has studied WWII and the Nazi state extensively, in university and independently. I feel that, unfortunately, there will be detractors about any movie about this or any other emotionally charged and polarizing subject matter. There are no universal aesthetics the filmmakers could use that would please everyone; the caricature of the Nazis as monsters and the German civilians as blind followers has preformed the rest of the world's opinions as to what is the most ""accurate"" portrayal of this subject. I was afraid that I wouldn't be able to forget the caricatures and Riefenstahl's immortal presentation of these historical figures, and see them as flawed, deluded and twisted human beings. Because these WERE humans, and I find that to be the most important thing to remember when learning about Nazi Germany, Stalinist Russia, The Great Leap Forward, the hard-line Islamic take-over of Iran, the removal and extermination campaigns waged against indigenous people in the New World...name your tragedy, and there is a logical ""noble"" philosophy behind it, being adhered to with blinded fervor. It was carried out by human beings, not monsters, not madmen. People following a deadly and cold line of logic to a bitter and bloody end. That was what this movie made all the more clear to me.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
this is the best....,"Who better to make a WWII film than the Germans themselves? This is possibly the best WWII film I have seen yet. It is a very intense movie about the final days of Adolf Hitler (a SUPERB roll played by Bruno Ganz, he should get at least one Oscar for this...) which had me coming back to see the movie a second and even a third time (I saw T3 only twice, he he). And not only Bruno Ganz has done a great performance, the entire cast gives it all their best. Very good film indeed.As I said, it's a film about Adolf Hitlers final days, trapped in a bunker in Berlin, while the Russians are slowly moving closer. Hitler losing his faith in a 'good' outcome, the final bullet, everything is has happened for real. But when I left the cinema I had the idea I had just been watching a fictional story. A perfect script, made in real life 59 years ago. Not much to say about anything else. If you are interested in WWII stuff, go see it in the cinema, it's worth every penny.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Not Das Boot,"I know it's dangerous going to a movie with expectations, but not knowing very much about ""Downfall"" except for its excellent reviews here at IMDb.com I was anticipating something like ""Das Boot"" with brown dirt for green water.As a film this drama's execution is quite superb. The audience seems transported into Hitler's bunker during those last days of the war. The city above is a wreck, and so is Hitler. Boys and girls and the elderly must take up futile positions against the advancing Soviet troops. No need for another plot synopsis here -- it's been well covered by the previous posts here.Somewhere into this long and very engaging movie a chill set in. Yes, these Germans were real people, not monstrous demons, and this movie wasn't portraying their days here as heroic, but... Then something very odd struck me: during the scenes where the solitary Hitler contemplates his inevitable end, a poignant music plays in the background. It sounds familiar and my mind reaches back to my music school days to place it. It's from Johann Sebastian Bach's Mass in b-minor, specifically, the Crucifixus. Here in the film score, it appears sans words and chorus, but the music is distinct and powerful. Originally intended to evoke the tragedy and sacrifice of Jesus Christ (""he was crucified for us, made to suffer and was entombed..."") here it is an offense. Is this the real point of view of the film, is this its purpose? To portray Hitler as a grand person who suffered persecution and betrayal?Or am I reading too much into what is only an element of the drama? Well, Albert Speer is portrayed as a dapper (an architect in a suit rather than a minister in a uniform), intelligent, urbane, and compassionate man. He and Hitler have a conversation about their lost future over Speer's model of the Berlin that was to be. Yet wasn't Speer beloved of Hitler out of a compatible grandiosity? Wasn't that Berlin-to-be dominated by a palace with a dome a thousand feet high? Didn't this cultured architect become Hitler's Minister of Weapons and Armaments and ruthlessly use slave labor in the service of the Third Reich? In this film, he is a rather unfortunate artist caught up in the whirlwind of the times. No way.No doubt the Germans were real people. How did they get talked into this grand, barbaric, and murderous scheme? Yes, they were like us. So could this happen to us too? Don't see this movie, don't shed tears for Hitler, and don't even entertain the notion suggested in this movie that he was a persecuted and betrayed savior. Don't participate in the rehabilitation of Nazism.",1.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
A landmark performance,"I would give this an 7.5 or 8, if it were not for Bruno Ganz. In fact, I will dare say that the biggest crime surrounding this film is that Ganz was not lauded with every single acting award available. Never before has such dimensionality and care been applied to a performance of, quite possibly, the most vile human who ever lived (with the exception, perhaps, of his cohort Himmler). It's a confusing, sharp yet tender mix of sorrow, pity, anger, and ultimately, frustration.Initially, I figured this would be a very low budget chamber piece. But it is as epic in scope as a Spielberg war film, with effects to match. A real surprise. But don't be fooled by eye candy. Der Untergang is a human story. It is an amazing built film. And it is unreal. A must-see.",,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Important for our understanding of How It All Could Happen,"This is an important film and absolutely a must for anyone who has ever pondered how WWII, the Holocaust and all that was at all possible.Der Untergang has sometimes been criticized for making Hitler and the Nazis look sympathetic and human. I saw it like this: the most horrifying thing about Hitler and Nazis is that they WERE humans, not some caricature monsters of hell. The movie displays this very well, without sympathizing or underlining the evil of these human beings.If you're a human being equipped with normal feelings, you ARE right in feeling slightly compassionate towards a crying Hitler. But at the same time, if you're a normal person, your compassion vanishes when you remember why he's crying. He's not regretting his inhuman deeds. He's not feeling remorse for the suffering of other people. He's crying because his horrible plans have failed, because he thinks the German people have failed him.I also think Der Untergang points out an important thing about the Nazi ideology. It was and is evil because it is based on intense hate and the conscious rejection of compassion. People blinded by this kind of ideology are also blinded by hatred, and as we know this phenomenon is unfortunately alive and well in today's world, in the East and the West as well. Movies like Der Untergang give us an important lesson in understanding this dangerous way of thought and the utter madness and vanity of war. Go see this if you can.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
"""Downfall""of a Monster","""I was not an enthusiastic Nazi,"" a woman's voice-over tells us at the opening of ""Downfall,"" as if to underscore her lack of complicity in Germany's actions in the second World War, or perhaps to convince herself. It is 1943 when director Oliver Hirschbiegel's film about the last tormented days of Adolph Hitler begins, and that voice belongs to the real Traudl Junge (played here by Alexandra Maria Lara), one of several young women smuggled into the Führer's headquarters in East Prussia to interview for a position as his private secretary. When she messes up the first go-round at dictation, Traudl, whose curiosity about Hitler is the catalyst for her adventure, is moved by the dictator's gentleness and generosity. A moment later she is jumping for joy to land such a prestigious position.Two and a half years later, things are considerably different. The German military has suffered severe losses, Berlin is under artillery attack by the advancing Russians, the great experiment in National Socialism is crumbling like the city, and Hitler (Bruno Ganz) and his key commandants have retreated to the leader's private bunker. But the megalomaniacal Hitler, who irrationally still believes he can produce a Third Reich that is a German ""treasure house of art and culture"" comparable to that of the ancient Greek and Roman civilizations, not only refuses to give up, but also shouts at his minions that a new military strategy is in effect that will help them win the war. How delusional!Despite their resolute faith in the Führer, even some of the elite members of the SS have come to mistrust his judgment. Albert Speer (Heino Ferch), the famed architect of the Third Reich, looks askance at Hitler over a table top model of the cultural structures he planned to create for the master race. Field marshall Hermann Göring cannot (or will not) obey orders. Nazi doctors refuse to let civilians and young men die without some attempt at medical attention. When Hitler is told that ""fifteen to twenty thousand"" of those young men were lost in an effort to fight off the Russians, his heartlessly-spewed response is: ""that's what they're for."" But he will go out onto the street during a lull in the shelling to honor youngsters as heroes who ""history will take note of,"" and pinch the cheek of one particularly innocent- looking lad.The bipolarity of a man who himself has gone down in history as one of its greatest monsters is at the heart of ""Downfall,"" the screenplay (by Bernd Eichinger) for which is based on historian Joachim Fest's book (The Downfall: Inside Hitler's Bunker, The Last Days of the Third Reich) and on the memoir of the real Traudl Junge (Until the Final Hour: Hitler's Last Secretary). The film does not ask us to sympathize with this madman (given his actions, how could it?), but it does present a profile of a man who, despite his obvious dementia, still managed to hold sway over those who earlier pledged their loyalty to him and were determined to maintain it to the bitter end. And is it ever bitter.The claustrophobic confines of the elaborately designed bunker (by Production Designer Bernd Lepel) are reminiscent of the submarine in the German film ""Das Boot."" We can practically smell its fetid air and feel the walls closing in on us as the Russians close in on the city. Given these circumstances, we can understand how Eva Braun (""Nowhere in Africa's"" Juliane Köhler in another terrific performance) can say to Traudl, ""The shelling has stopped, let's go for a walk,"" even if the suggestion is as insane as staying with Hitler.But like the others who stick it out and who, in many instances, make inhuman, incomprehensible sacrifices to do so, both women descend yet again to that labyrinth of madness.Aside from the exploration of Hitler's increasingly fragile grip on reality, what is most fascinating about how he is depicted is his appeal, particularly to women. In addition to Traudl and Eva Braun, the short, mustachioed man with the thinning comb-over mesmerized such otherwise strong-willed women as pilot Hanna Reitsch (Anna Thalbach), and Magda Goebbels (Corinna Harfouch), wife of Nazi propagandist Joseph Goebbels (Ulrich Matthes). As such, ""Downfall's"" strength is greatest when it sticks to these human dynamics rather than when it sidetracks to subplots outside the bunker that have little or nothing to do with the story that unfolds in that enclosed world.War is the ugliest, or among the ugliest of human actions, and ""Downfall"" does not glamorize it. On the contrary, despite its technically superb cinematography (by Rainer Klausmann, who also shot ""Head On""), there are a number of graphic sequences that underscore the horrors of war, as if we needed reminding. Then again, perhaps we do.""Downfall"" does not necessarily present new information on those last twelve days of Hitler's life, but it does present it in a worthwhile way. In a time of war, such as the one we are currently living in, it is important to remember that monsters are made, not born, and that they lurk beneath the surface of some otherwise very ordinary humans.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

Bruno Ganz, Alexandra Maria Lara and Juliane Köhler have given one of the best performances ever. They have lived through the characters, simply irresistible.

A Not Horrible Enough Telling of a Horrible Story,"This ensemble film about the last days of Hitler and his Nazi regime should have left me chilled and disturbed, but I found it oddly soft.Bruno Ganz is terrific as Hitler, but he feels like a supporting character in his own drama. The film focuses on too many people, blunting the tautness and drama of what took place in that famed bunker during those dark days in April 1945. The movie feels overly scripted; there are too many scenes that smacked of a soap operatic melodrama. And it's too tasteful or cautious to confront the most horrific moments head on. I'm not one to advocate for gratuitous violence in films, but Steven Spielberg showed in ""Schindler's List"" that graphic violence is sometimes a necessity when telling a story as horrible as any of the numerous stories about what the Nazis did to the world.The whole time I was watching this film, I wondered what it would have been like if it had been in the black and white, stark style of Michael Haneke's ""The White Ribbon."" That movie, which I saw nearly a year ago, still haunts me, while ""Downfall,"" which I saw a couple of weeks ago, I've already nearly forgotten.Grade: B",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Stunned,"This film should be shown in schools. I think that the Nazi party has always been something that is difficult for children to grasp, to horrific to be real. This film gives them a humanity that had been long overdue, and, in doing so, makes you realise how lucky we are that they were defeated. Bruno Ganz and Thomas Kretschmann put in the best performances for me, all though there was no member of the cast that I could find fault with. Schindlers List is an excellent film, but the Nazi's in that are inhumane monsters. In this film (as in The Pianist, again with Thomas Kretschmann), the humanity makes the drama all the more gripping and truthful.

Der Untergang,"This movie shouldn't have been made, because it is absolutely impossible to express this part of the history in posterior made pictures. Let us remember that the plot of this film is based on the personal experiences of Hitler's secretary, Traudl Junge, the script written by Joachim Fest, a historian known as viewing history from a very conservative angle. To persons like him history consists in the results of the thoughts and deeds of persons at power, instead of understanding history as the sum of what all humans are thinking and doing, not to forget the effects of what is happening in the nature around us and, not less important, of what happens by accident.The realism of this film is its weakest point, because it creates at the spectator the illusion of being well informed about what really happened. To learn more about the psychotic nature of this depraved crew of gangsters I would recommend to view Leni Riefenstahl's documentary ""Triumph des Willens"" about the ""Reichsparteitag"" in Nuremberg, Germany, from 1935, made on Hitler's orders. There you can see the real physiognomies and discover the collective paranoia in which fell most of the people of a country which was until then considered as a ""Kulturnation"".",1.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Hitler's last days,"Downfall is an enthralling film that examine the final days of the Nazi hierarchy ensconced in their bunker. It is a war story I have never encountered before, the German view of the last days in 1945. As the war is lost we see the Nazis throwing their own citizens in peril as the red army takes control of Berlin.As Goebbels remarks, he has no sympathy for the German citizens, they made their choice, gave the Nazis the mandate now they will face the consequences.Downfall is told from the view of Traudl Junge (Alexandra Maria Lara) a young woman from Munich taken on by Hitler as a secretary in 1942. Her memoir is one of the sources of the movie's narrative.Hitler (Bruno Ganz) is increasingly unhinged at times shouts like a rabid dog of comrades, generals that have betrayed him. His acolytes in the bunker, some remain loyal, some look to get out, some look for a glorious death, others just to survive. As the city is near to falling, you see a few of the officers getting increasingly drunk, (Eva Braun lives a decadent life even as the city is being pounded) others make way in to the bunker and hear Hitler speak of some miraculous, imaginary strategy that an army division will come to the rescue. In the meantime he is making plans for his own and Eva's death and destruction of their bodies.As Berlin is destroyed, its citizens turn on in each other, people get hung as Russian collaborators. A young boy is part of a makeshift resistance to repel the Russians and then just tries to make his way home.At the end you see the Goebbels who decide it is National Socialism or nothing and Mrs Goebbels calmly kills her own children before they take their own lives.The film finishes as we see documentary footage of Junge who confesses she did not know what was happening under the Nazis but she should had looked harder, after all Sophie Scholl who was also from Munich knew what was happening.Downfall is apparently faithful to the facts. It is not just a film that is set in the bunker, you see the fighting in the city, the German soldiers trying to resist, getting conflicting orders at times impossible orders. One General is ordered to be shot for leaving his lines, he has not and goes to see Hitler to complain.Director Oliver Hirschbiegel has made a commanding film that holds your attention and a blazing performance by Ganz. His Hitler is ill and mad, knowing his dream of the Third Reich is in ruins.Flip flopping between reality and fantasy surrounded by sycophants who want Hitler to leave Berlin. He is suspicious of his military leaders, who feel betrayed by Hitler's overconfidence and ineptitude. They wish to pursue peace at this late stage.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
I wish I could vote higher than 10 out of 10 for this film,"This film is an absolutely stupendous achievement. Every aspect of this production is perfect. Brilliantly photographed, keenly written & directed, and filled with stellar performances led by Bruno Ganz, Der Untergang piqued my curiosity and made my skin crawl.I was aghast at the insanity and the horror that was the final days of the Third Reich. And leading the crazed was the Fuhrer himself, a miserable, twisted, twitching wretch of a man. Bruno Ganz is amazing as he lets us see all aspects of the man's personality, from kindly father to deranged psychopath. We see Hitler as a polite, well-mannered diner. We see Hitler as a screaming lunatic, ordering his generals to marshal forces which no longer exist. We see him as a devoted dog lover and vegetarian. We see him as a man who has no mercy for the brother of his longtime mistress (and soon-to-be wife). Mr. Ganz is worth 10 stars alone, even if you saw & heard nothing else in this film.I would be remiss were I not to also sing the praises of Alexandra Maria Lara, who portrays Traudl Junge, one of Hitler's secretaries. The film is told primarily from her point of view, and Ms. Lara's performance was compelling. I have no idea how you prepare for a role like this; portraying the hopelessness of being trapped with lunatics while bombs destroy everything except your locale cannot be easy, but Ms. Lara made me feel it every time she was on the screen. (It doesn't hurt that she is breathtakingly beautiful, either.)The script (by producer Bernd Eichinger) is excellent, covering a lot of ground succintly and elegantly. The direction is top-notch, providing us with the grit of real battles and the surreal atmosphere of Hitler's bunker. Locations, costumes, lighting, sets... every technical aspect of this film is perfect. It is as if they were able to somehow film the past.The horrors of Nazi Germany are well documented and publicized, as we strive to prevent that particular piece of history from repeating itself. Der Untergang's greatest achievement is that it is able to so perfectly place us in the middle of 10 of the worst days in the lives of some of the worst people ever to walk the planet. To see them as human beings, and not caricatures, is amazing. I tell you, I was unable to stop myself at times from simply muttering ""that's crazy! Madness!"" How can human's become so twisted, so deranged?Film is an inherently powerful medium, bombarding our senses like no other form of entertainment. As such, viewing this film in the larger context of the desirability of promulgating and maintaining a warlike culture may have a lasting impact on the viewer.A masterful achievement. All involved should be proud.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
'Saving Private Ryan' without the schmaltzy overtones.,"You couldn't really expect to make a 'typical' movie out of the story of last days of the archetypal fascist dictator. 'Untergang' seeks to illustrate the situation of 'sane' people under the control of a madman; that and the impending arrival of the Red Army is the only dramatic jeopardy available - no romantic interlude, nothing to achieve, no sentimental buddy rescue shtick. We witness the reactions of people like you and me (and don't be silly enough to imagine I include Goebbels, etc. - I mean people doing their jobs under impending calamity) who happened to be in the wrongest place at the wrongest time. If this dilemma doesn't absorb you, it's a fault of your imagination, not of the utterly brilliant recreation of something very few people survived to bear witness to. 'Untergang' doesn't seek to make a judgment of Hitler because it doesn't need to: all you need to appreciate is his increasing detachment from reality and the way that this divides the people stuck with him. If there's any sort of judgment, it's of the herd mentality of people as a whole. The film becomes a series of stunning docu-vignettes of the various levels of humanity involved, each one posing the question 'What would YOU have done?'. This film is thought-provoking, and that naturally makes many denizens of the internet uncomfortable.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
"Interesting, but emotionally flat","I just saw this on DVD. As a WWII film buff, I found this film interesting from a historical perspective. Certainly the best and most dramatic depiction of the fall of Berlin that I've seen. But as a ""movie,"" I found it lacking. There is no central POV; we're introduced to many characters, some of whom we recognize by sight (Goering and Goebbles have become caricatures over time)while others are unknown and their roles are never really explained. A friend is currently reading a book called HITLER'S INNER CIRCLE. Perhaps if I'd read that before seeing the film I may have had a better understanding of who all the personalities were. Rather than focusing solely on the bunker goings-on this film takes us to the streets of greater Berlin where we see generals making futile last stands and encounter roving bands of vigilantes executing anyone trying to flee the chaos and destruction. While these scenes are interesting, they take us away from the central story, which is Hitler and his main underlings' last stand. I felt drained at the end of this film. Nobody to cheer for, nobody to feel sympathy for. The people depicted were the architects of the greatest mass murder and sheer carnage the world has ever seen so they are unable to generate any emotion in the viewer. The only question I had at the end was why couldn't these psychos, murderers, and criminals have committed suicide a decade earlier?",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Good but could have been better,"Der Untergang was a good movie, but actually it did not quite live up to my expectations. First, I would have preferred a classic dramatic plot structure, rather than this docu-dramatization. The storytelling style was that of a bystander and not a filmmaker. I think the movie could have been much more effective with a more stylized narrative structure.Also, the movie didn't really go into the political philosophy aspects of Hitler's Nazi regime. There were tiny snippets of it in the dialogue, but the monstrosities, pseudo-science and sheer idiocy of the Nazi ideology were barely touched upon at all. And the Jews weren't even mentioned until the movie was almost over.I don't know the decisions underlying these choices of what to show and what not to, but I did not feel we got the whole story, nor an adequate impression of the nature of Nazism (and thus of Hitler). We got a personally focused ""reality""-style drama mostly set in a bunker - we got as incomplete a picture of the whole as some soldier who had been present in the bunker at the time would have gotten. Not a heck of a lot more.Still, it was a serious and no doubt cathartic movie (for the Germans), and it opened up some sore wounds and commenced the process of healing them. The acting was great, and I have no objection to showing Hitler with a human face - though a lot of people may not realize it, Hitler *was* a human being. The monstrosities he was part of was not wholly of his doing; it was to a very great degree a result of larger social trends in the population at large. No one among the ordinary people knew where it would go, so no one can be blamed. We can only learn from our mistakes and do our damnedest not to repeat them.7 out of 10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
"Extremely detailed, and way too long","Having traveled from the Netherlands to Germany to see this movie, you might understand I was quite curious about this German production.Well, in the beginning, the movie is fairly exciting, it gives a very accurate picture of life inside the Berlin bunker. Hitler as a person is depicted realistically and is interesting to watch. But, after a while, things become boring. Everyone who has some interest in Second World War history knows what happened, and it is indeed shown in detail. No minor detail of the happenings is left out. Although this is ideal for purists and Nazi fetishists, for the play itself, which must be considered drama rather than documentary, it makes the movie a very long sit, leaving the viewer only to wish the movie goes to an end. Another point of criticism is the fact that of the main players, no biography is given somehow during the play. Younger people,like me do not exactly know what names like Speer, Göbbels and Goering were responsible for in the third Reich.",3.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
"An intense and gritty film, which explores Hitler's final days.","The final days of Hitler, Eva Braun and his inner circle, as detailed by Hitler's secretary Traudl Junge. An exploration of the final events inside that bunker as The Russians close in, and Berlin is destroyed.Harsh, gritty, relentless, there are many words I can think of to describe this great film, what it feels though, is realistic. It's an interesting focus, I can't think of many films or dramas that focus on the final days, it's fascinating.I love the way that it depicts Hitler in his final moments, a man that feels betrayed by those around him, blaming everyone around him.One thing I feel they totally got right, The Russians, they certainly did not take any prisoners, their revenge was bloody and devastating, they arrived with heavy artillery, and numbers.This film tremendously captures Germany's final days at war, you can see the panic and desperation, a refusal to accept defeat in some quarters. The visuals are incredible, from the sets and uniforms, to the destruction of Berlin.Bruno Ganz delivers a tremendous performance, I read that he put a lot of time and effort in to researching Hitler, and it shows. What a shame he didn't win a mass of awards, he should have, he even shows Hitler's Parkinson's disease.There are a few second world war films I would say are essential viewing, this and Das Boot are two I would highly recommend.Outstanding, 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Absolutely amazing,"Superlatives cannot do this film justice. Bruno Ganz in the role of his life as Hitler is extraordinary, but his performance is only so strong because of the outstanding supporting cast. An absolutely essential film for anyone with an interest in history and politics. It is not 'just another WW2 movie' because it takes you into the heart of fanaticism, the people who instigate and lead that fanaticism and the people that consent to be led by them even to the death of themselves and everything they love. Nothing could be more relevant today.Even watching it on small screen you find yourself wincing at the suicides, the injuries and the explosions, and gasping at the coldness and horror taking place. The fact that it is based to the closest word and detail on two eyewitness accounts just knocks other supposedly 'realistic' pieces like Band of Brothers, Saving Private Ryan, etc. into a cocked hat.I have only two (slight) criticisms. Yet again in a film Hitler comes across as a gibbering madman - he was far more calculating, chilling and subtle than that, or he could not have seized power, fooled the 'Great Powers' into inaction, and then led a modern, industrialized country to its own utter destruction in the space of a few years. As the film develops though there are glimpses of the former Hitler, and the supporting cast are utterly convincing in their fanaticism - the actors playing Goebbels and his wife are particularly strong. As the film goes on we start to see this is the end of an incredibly powerful process. The supporting cast show just the right combination of fear, desperation and total, self-annihilating belief in Hitler and his leadership. Most of them are literally seeing for the first time the situation they have let themselves in for, and the true nature of their leader. Secondly, you couldn't want it to be any longer - an edited down version for those with only a couple of hours on hand would be good.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
A profound and powerful film with a fantastic central performance,"A film that takes you into the heart of darkness that was Adolf Hitler. An absorbing central performance by Bruno Ganz that allowed me to imagine what it must have been like in that bunker as the second world war drew to a close. I found the film completely believable and one of those rare things in cinema, a film that stays with you and which returns to you weeks, even months after you see it. A disturbing and unsettling film in that the intimate portrayal of Hitler as a fallible human being invites us to empathise with him, despite all that we know about his political fanaticism and monstrous actions. In this regard, this is an important film from Germany about German history. It is courageous and bravura film making and an important contribution to understanding how fascism came to power in Germany and why, of course, it must never be allowed to do so anywhere else again.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Far and away the best film of 2005,"I came across this film in the video store while searching for a movie I have already forgotten. It wedged in a tiny column in between entire walls of ""Brokeback Mountain"" and ""The Wedding Crashers."" It was only because of the Oscar buzz over the former and the sophomoric media hoopla over the latter that this film has received such little attention here in the US despite being vastly superior to either.What impressed me the most about this film was Bruno Ganz's acting. His portrayal of Hitler was the capstone to a production effort that could have stood without him. As a historian I have seen the footage of Hitler giving speeches and read numerous accounts of his madman personality (both on stage and in private) that held his audiences spellbound. Ganz could have been forgiven had he failed to capture this virtually impossible act, yet he does so flawlessly. Words can't really describe it; the viewer must witness it for himself. At the same time, however, Ganz manages to portray the human side of Hitler as well, the non-drinking, non-smoking vegetarian who was an absolute hit with children. It is a true testament to Ganz's performance that some historically-illiterate critics felt that he portrayed Hitler as being ""too human"" while others felt he went overboard in his portrayal of Hitler's lunacy.Ganz is not the whole show, however. Much of the movie is focused on the plight of every Berliner, ranging from Eva Braun and Hitler's close subordinates to Hitler Youth mounting a last stand in the streets to the old men and women being chased through the streets as ""deserters"" by the SS. The acting is superb across the board and the production of Berlin burning is downright disturbing in its accuracy. Those with narrow attention spans will have difficulty with the length but the engaged viewer will find themselves enjoying every minute. This film is a true masterpiece and the best piece of German cinema since ""Das Boot"".",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Piece of catharsis,"A important film for discover the image of a time without shadows of propaganda or preconceptions.A important film for see Hitler not like supreme monster but like small man at end of ambition.A important film for explore of different faces of reality, for understand the personal truth like ordinary form of self-protection.A film about the corpse of an ambiguous era, about the shards of a lie, about death and duty, about closed worlds and anatomy of fear, about fake myths and foolish hope, about sense of life and signification of final gestures.It is a movie, a splendid movie about fall of Nazi regime. In same measure, it is touching description of any dictator crush, about dissolution of a powerful image and Utopian project.The presence of Alexandra Maria Lara is more than a brilliant acting example. The sensitivity, the look, the relation with a twilight universe are amazing.And Bruno Ganz... .

The best and most gripping film I've ever seen,"I hate the term 'war' films. The best 'war' films aren't war films at all, they are anti-war films. By that I mean that the films portray a story that should leave all who watch them with a deeper understanding of the suffering involved, the lives that are destroyed and the pointless waste. There have been several excellent films of this genre. Saving Private Ryan, Schindlers List, Gallipoli, Lion of the Desert are just a few. This film, this masterpiece, sits atop that list. I have never seen a more gripping saga in my life, absolutely stunning.Every performance from every actor, from the incredible Bruno Ganz, down to the young children playing the Goebbels children, was immaculate.Even now, several weeks after I first saw it, I have vivid memories of scenes from the film, not just the graphic harrowing scenes which I think will always remain with me, but the conversations, the one between Hitler and Speer springs to mind. Added to these are the scenes of Hitler's rages and the brilliantly intimate camera work which gives the viewer a 'close up', 1st person view of the film.There are far too many excellent reasons why someone should watch this film to be listed here.Basically, it will keep you enthralled for the two and a half hours (it flies by), and it will leave you emotionally drained at the end.Trust me....this is no 'war' film!",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
"One of the best WWII films ever made, brilliantly depicting the turmoil of the Third Reich's last days.","I admit that I only heard of this movie through watching Youtube spoofs of Hitler's tirade scene, but the film interested me so much that I had to see for myself. I only EVER give reviews to movies which I feel are either terrible or extraordinary. This movie was the latter. It is by far one of the best WWII films ever made, and the best made in the 21st century.I was blown away when I finished the film, stunned by its visual effect quality, precise acting, and near perfect play-out of the plot. The film shows the tumultuous and rocky end of the Reich's last 12 days, as you witness the end of Hitler's empire in his very bunker. The screenplay gives marvelous insight into the inner conflict that the Fuhrer himself suffers as well as the conflict with his most loyal commanders and generals. Seeing the story from the eyes of Traudl Junge (played by the beautiful and talented Alexandra Maria Lara)is another special treat, as you see her own struggle between loyalty to the Reich and personal conscience.The film is by far superior to many of its ""end-of-the-Reich"" predecessors. For its brilliant screenplay, superb acting, and intense storytelling, it gets a 10 from me.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Astonishing film puts a human face on inhuman horror.,"For those unfamiliar with the film, Downfall portrays the last two weeks of the Nazi government flitting from the bunker beneath the Chancellery to the civilian bomb shelters to the embattled streets of the ruined capital.It's astonishing achievement is to put a human face to some of the most infamous figures in history; it strips away the stereotypes and hyperbole and absurd dramatics to let you see the people behind the caricatures without diminishing the horrors they wrought. It brings home the meaning of Hannah Arendt's chilling phrase, ""the banality of evil"". Yet the film never descends into banality for more than a few minutes, and always to contrast it with the chaos and brutality that evil engenders.Bruno Ganz is brilliant in his portrayal of Hitler; you can see the charm and charisma that won people to him and the monster that dwelt within. Unlike earlier portrayals which dwelt on the injections and sera he used, Ganz shows a palsied dictator with full command of his intellect (if not his emotions) right to the end. This is more horrifying than seeing a drug-addled psychopath as has become stereotypical in movies on the Third Reich... though sometimes the horror takes time to settle in, as it did for many who met the dictator in person. Ganz's Hitler is not mad but deeply in denial of the consequences of his actions and so wed to his doctrine of the fuererprincip that he is incapable of understanding defeat. His chilling switches between compassion for those in his immediate surroundings and utter ruthlessness towards everyone else are made all the more terrifying as a result, as is his repeated refusal to shoulder any blame for the disasters and desertions around him.As is entirely appropriate, the film focuses on Hitler; however, it does so mainly through the eyes of his private secretary Traudl Junge (played by Alexandra Maria Lara). The film begins and ends with a voice-over by the real-life Junge (not to be missed) and the action starts by showing, as a prologue, the young Junge's application and interview for the job in 1942. We see in her the unthinking loyalty shown to her leader, often against her better judgment; though she plainly wishes to leave the bunker, she finds herself unable to do so until after the dictator's suicide. Lara's performance is overshadowed by Ganz's but this is no reflection upon her skills; and once we see her leave the Bunker we get a much clearer demonstration in her acting ability as she navigates the ruins to safety.We see the horrors of the final battle primarily through the character of Peter Krantz (Donevan Gunia), a twelve-year-old awarded with the Iron Cross in Hitler's last birthday review of the troops for destroying two Soviet tanks. Krantz's desperate eagerness to strike at the enemy gives way, after a final and horrible defeat, to a child-like retreat to home and family only to see it torn apart; the irony is that it's not at the hands of vengeful Russian troops, but by Nazi vigilantes punishing ""desertion"" and disloyalty.Juliane Kohler's Eva Braun shows just how shallow and banal people in high places can get. A party girl trapped in a holocaust, we see her cling to alcohol and music and routine distractions to shut out the horror. More horribly, she succeeds... her stunning (and yet entirely believable) reversal from weeping petitioner when her brother-in-law is about to be shot for desertion to obedient bride of Hitler takes the breath away. Kohler doesn't let us see much of what's inside Braun simply because there's so little there in the character; Braun is an empty shell who fills herself with the attention of others, a mere veneer of vivacity around a human void as shown by her chatty final testament (narrated over a sequence of soldiers and civilians dying brutally in the rubble above).Diametrically opposed, yet in strange harmony, is Corinna Harfouch's portrayal of Magda Gobbels. She is coldly intelligent and powerful yet entirely subservient to her fuehrer. Her poisoning of the children to ""save"" them from a world without Nazism is gut-churningly impossible to shut out; her shrugging off of a comforting touch by husband Joseph Gobbels (Ulrich Matthes) afterward followed by a studious application to a game of solitaire is just as wrenching, as is her pathetic final plea to a suicidal Hitler to flee the city. Matthes' doctrinaire yet emotional portrayal of the Propaganda Minister is also chilling, as is his strange helplessness and inability to face the deaths of family and leader.The other performances in the film are all excellent; I only avoid mentioning further details to keep the length of this review manageable. See the film to see the dedication of the doctors within and the bizarre mix of power and powerlessness, courage and poltroonery, and insight and vapidity in the assembled generals.The set dressing is thorough and good; militaria enthusiasts will see great attention to detail shown in the costuming, though alas there are some minor deficits in equipment that admittedly only those who have studied the period closely will notice. The sound is superbly authentic.I'll wind this down by saying that the movie succeeds in its goal of bringing home the human face of an inhuman tragedy. I won't forget this film.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
As brutally authentic as a film gets: there is no entertainment to be found here.,"As Downfall begins, World War Two and Berlin are already hopelessly lost, but yet Hitler issues orders to imaginary armies, and his cadre of generals never does more than tactfully disagree as millions of civilian lives are deliberately jeopardised to no meaningful end. Downfall shines a hard light into Berlin's bunkers, and illuminates a politics both repugnant, and scary in its proximity to politics we know.The film follows one of Hitler's secretaries, a high-ranking army doctor, Goebbel's wife, a twelve-year old panzer killer, a general encouraging withdrawal from Berlin, and the general defending it. Their stories play out in Berlin's command bunker and through what is left of its streets and buildings. When all of their doings and meetings are put together, one arrives at a rich picture of Berlin's lasts gasps.We see snatches of the ordinary Berliner's war, of the embattled soldier's war, but mostly we look in upon the actions of Hitler's officers, companions, and civilian attachés. We see them execute erratic orders; variously urge or resist a withdrawal from Berlin; prepare to slip away themselves; write last testaments; sit listless; whore; drink and carouse; labour with the wounded; or prepare for their suicide, and perhaps the murder of their family. What emerges is a compelling interrogation of fanaticism.The mind boggles at the naïvety of some of the film's acquaintances, but is most disturbed by the actions of its officer class, who know Hitler's behaviour to be entirely irrational yet observe his orders all the same. Many of his generals value their duty to a madman resolved upon death above the lives of millions; the overwhelming concern of others is self-preservation. Why was their no coup in these last days? That is the question which this film will have your mind screaming.Downfall feels like a fly-on-the-wall documentary, the shots are too well composed and the crew too invisible, but it feels that authentic. The dull grey-green film stock familiar from Saving Private Ryan et. al. helps, but it is the film's remarkable performances, production design, and effects, which really carry the day.In appearance the film is every bit as convincing as Private Ryan, but it is made still more verisimilar by the absence of any sentimental narrative concessions. Downfall doggedly, dispassionately shows the callousness of the war and its key prosecutors. In the bunker one encounters a menagerie of moralities just as distorted as Hitler's. A few of Downfall's scenes are of the most disturbing nature.Hitler is not amongst the characters that the camera loosely follows through the film. His centrality to the action probably wins him the most screen time, but our experience of him includes waiting in anterooms and peering down corridors. Thus, cunningly, the power relations around him are revealed; and we get to listen in to both back room and front room politics.Bruno Ganz's performance is excellent; his Hitler is delusional, tyrannical, and monumentally immoral, but still he conjures some of the charisma and personal kindness that must have seduced those around him. Incredibly, when released in Oz, film critics talked about Downfall's sympathetic portrayal of Hitler: they must have been watching a different film! Ganz is truly repellent; to take his character further would only make it a caricature. His moments of humanity, and his tired physique, only make the whole man more terrible. His portrayal rings true because we can perceive something of how he came to power.Juliane Köhler also makes a powerful impression as a flighty, selfish, unhinged Eva Braun. You might just hate fanatical ice woman Magda Goebbels (Corinna Harfouch) more than her husband before the film's end. But her fanaticism is no more amazing than the determined naivety of secretary Traudl Junge (Alexandra Maria Lara); a snippet of the real person talking in interview caps the film. What she says is what most German war survivors now say about their culpability; however, after what you've just seen, one's disbelief at such systematic ignorance is more acute than ever.Downfall is flawlessly executed; the feelings it elicits are intense. It is well deserving of a ten, but one would never call this film entertainment.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
The Passion of the Anti-Christ,"I call this the ""Passion of the Anti-Christ"" because there are, although strained, similarities in how this movie effect me.This movie is about a character from history that is larger than history. Hitler has become a symbol of evil, and certainly I am not the first person to place Adolf Hitler as the ultimate nemesis anti-Christ. But this is the surface of this movie.Underneath, this movie is about the German people. The ability of one man to take advantage of the post-WWI trauma of a culture and manipulate it until the lines of compassion and inhumanity become blurred. Conformity and hypocrisy were not the only traits of the German people.I have always been unable to create a scenario in which I could see how anyone could justify Hilter's world as a good thing. Even with the fear of the power of the Nazi party, the end of war should have given those with fear of the government should have been emboldened.But this portrayal creates a very real world. There were those in Hitler's inner circle who were fanatical followers, but that was not true of everyone. What we do see is a culture who in its last days floundered to grasp onto any hope-- hope to keep out the Russians, hope to keep the national pride that Hitler brought them from the ashes of a great depression, and the hope that the continued blind faith they gave to the ""Fuhrer"" would take them through.It was amazing that even in the last hours of Hitler's life the power he commanded. Even in his seemingly ""normal"" understated life those closest to him worshiped him.In his ""work life,"" generals would bicker and plead with their leader on the last moments to end the insanity, but never once disobeyed an order, even when it was to submit themselves to be shot.Just like ""the Passion,"" there is a message there that is important to us as humans. It is a warning about the tragedy of man and our ability to give our free will up in exchange for group think. It is also a message that evil is only the face of the movement, and that the people behind the mask are just like you and me.The fact that anyone has the potential to be evil. Even worse, that we can all delude ourselves that the horror within can easily be confused for passion, loyalty, and good.It is a hard movie to watch, because it is so well done that it is easy to look past the iconic mustache, swastikas and clicking heels and look at a people much like ourselves and think ""There but by the grace of God go I.""",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Der Untergang  is cinema gold!,"I have to say,Downfall was probably the best movies I have ever seen.Not only did the movie focus on the last days of Hitler,but also the last days of the third Reich.Seeing it through the eyes of one of Hitler's personal secretaries,Traudi Junge,gave me a clearer image of Nazi Germany's downfall.This is one of the very few movies I have seen that I believed I wasn't watching actors on the screen.It was SO real.You see how the members of the bunker have doubts and know they're not going to win.Bruno Ganz as the famous dictator was pure magic on the screen.He was like Hitler reincarnated for the screen.Like no other movie before,I can still remember the scenes vividly.The scenes just stay in my head,so much that i can probably watch the movie in my head.Another thing that made the movie real was the accuracy.Like previous movies about Hitler,they most likely ""twist the plot"" so it can appeal to a large audience.But this movie,they stayed close to the actual story as much as possible.The creators really did their homework on the accuracy thing.I was impressed Hitler wasn't really the main character,because not only do we see his side of the story,but for the first time ever,they show the other members side as well.We see a more definitive take on the whole regime.I would recommend this movie to anyone interested in the last days of Nazi Germany.Der Untergang is cinema at it's best.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
The Stage Under Das Boot,"I have a friend that does something she calls ""art therapy."" So calls it art because it uses the same material artists do and produces similar artifacts. When other people do this, I accept it as art, meaning that I allow it to penetrate all of my inner selves it can and make whatever changes it may. After all, aren't all artists engaged with their work in messy, tearful, dangerous ways?But with my friend, it is different. I know how she is damaged. I know why and a bit of how she produced her paintings. The artifact comes to me with that context. Her relationship to it is embossed on my relation to it, so it cannot dissolve into my soul. It only knows the pores of her soul. I suppose if I wanted to somehow re-enact her life it would be useful, but in truth, her stuff is useless to me. More than useless, because I can make art out of neutral found items, but hers aren't neutral.One could say that I might see her demons, but I defy anyone to examine that closely and believe it true. It is not the nature of therapy to serve things for others.I thought of my sad friend all throughout this film. Yes, it is skillfully produced in many ways. Yes, if you pull out this performance or that, you can admire decisions the actors have made. But films are not performances, they are narratives that resonate or not.This is one of the grand therapeutic gestures the Germans are making to resolve the past and distance themselves from it. The twists of character, certain embellishments of phrase, placement of the designated watcher all got in the way for me. I knew that this was a dialog Germans were having with themselves that I was eavesdropping on and grasping for a reason why.But having invested in it, both in time and emotional exercise, it does give me some value.Hitler intuited the role of ceremonial theater, of defining the narrative for a people. He only allowed choreographed films and photos, and never in private moments when he wasn't performing. His most important adviser was Speer, a dramatist who found and designed the stage for the superman. Speer was the most effective dramatist in history, measured by immediate deaths at least. Speer and Reifenstahl created the first effective political propaganda film, a masterpiece by any measure.Until the end, Speer as stage manager orchestrated the drama. He enters this story at the beginning, telling his man that he needs to be ""on the stage when the curtain comes down."" Later, when it really is, he visits his actor and tells him to spare the German people (which is denied as much as Hitler can). I get the feeling that this movie was as much directed by Speer to save the people as anything else he did.So within the drama, we have the director, the designated watcher (our doubly seen stenographer), and historical characters playing not so much those characters but well established German stereotypes. All in all, the construction is clever, and the execution slick.But it is therapeutic art. And we know it, and why it exists, and the specific damage associated with it. So even though it looks like art, it cannot be. It cannot change us.See ""Conspiracy"" for something from this era that perhaps could. Shucks, I see my comment for that has been deleted.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.The film.",,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Unique War Film,It was incredible to watch a movie made by the Germans about this topic. It is introspective and revealing. There are many dark scenes throughout. The movie captures the true loyalty of the German people to hitler at the time. I've never seen a movie like this.,7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
A German opinion....,"First of all, because I think it matters, I am from Germany.Almost everyday in our lives, we young German people are still confronted with what happened 60 years ago. Sometimes, we still have to be careful what we say about strangers, about people of foreign countries, about people of a different religion. 60 years after our grandparents made a few terrible mistakes. So far, so good. My generation has no idea, what it has meant to live in the 3rd Reich, how people could follow a sick man like Hitler, follow his pervert ideas, obey anything this mentally insane man. But still we have to carry our heritage, every day we have to remember what happened 60 years ago. We have to. And films like Downfall, Schindlers List or The Pianist let us not forget, let us learn and remember. And that's why movies like Downfall are necessary, are important. Especially, if they of such great quality as this one. Only in one point this film is dangerous: It creates a picture of Hitler as a man, not as a monster. A sick man, a man with pervert ideas attitudes, okay, but a man who can also be polite and regarding. A human being. It is no question, that this is an almost perfect personification of Hitler, Bruno Ganz is amazing and the scriptwriters were brilliantly informed about the Fuehrer as a person. But as I said, some people who still have these radical ideas and see Hitler as a God-like figure (and they exist, not only in Germany!) might misunderstand this personification. ""Der Untergang""is a masterpiece of German cinema, but it is nothing for a narrow-minded audience....",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
"Ganz is the star, not the endless supporting cast","With a stunning visual, complete with ravaged sets, realistic uniforms and murky cinematography, Der Untergang still has a greater asset: Bruno Ganz's mesmerizing performance. In the main role, he manages to follow all the lines the screenplay draws to him, varying from a decadent tyrant whose fits of anger sprout every minute, to a decaying Parkinson victim, to the gentleman that gained millions of Germans' trust with gentleman-ship. As faults, there is the awful lot of supporting roles that you barely remember at the end (the movie explains their destinies, but you can't recall what exactly they've done) and Alexandra Maria Lara's character, the uninteresting secretary of Hitler who never deserves the attention the film gives her - and Lara does little to make us like her. It was correct to show Hitler in all manners possible, because it leaves for viewers to decide when he makes sense and when he deserves the label of insane demon he has got. A daring character study that tries to give visibility to a man, not the legendary monster. He is still a monster, but this is no ideological movie: it just shows every sides of the story.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Compelling But With One Serious Flaw,"Watching DER UNTERGANG is something of a unique experience for me . It's not often I'd go out of my way to watch a foreign film , far less one that is often talkative and where the outcome is in no doubt . Even more remarkable is the fact that I sometimes rewatch this movie from start to end unable to take my eyes off screen . The reason ? It's one of the few films where the acting is truly compellingI heard a lot of controversy about DER UNTERGANG as soon as Bruno Ganz had been cast and together with director Oliver Hirschbiegel they both decided to make a film where every minor detail about Hitler's last days should be totally accurate . They succeeded and that's not only my opinion because every professional historian has remarked that Ganz interpretation is the only truly accurate portrayal of Adolph Hitler . You find yourself unable to take your eyes off screen every time Hitler appears . Also of worthy note is Ulrich Matthes as Joseph Goebbles . Note how often Matthes appears on screen where he doesn't have to say a word , his burning presence is enough to hold the audience attention and radiates great evil . It's almost as if the audience have jumped into a time machine and landed in Hitler's bunker in the spring of 1945 . It's so convincing it's almost enough to give you nightmaresI would have happily given DER UNTERGANG 10 out of 10 but it loses a couple of points because of a serious problem and that is the way it somehow tries to make out the people of Nazi Germany are also victims of the Nazi regime . Notice the speech by Goebbles where he sneers he's not interested in the suffering of the German civilian population because "" They voted for us and now their throats will be slit "". If you have little knowledge of European history 1939-45 ( I'm afraid such people are becoming more and more numerous as the years pass ) then you'll find yourself asking why don't the Germans just surrender ? It's easily explained by the fact that the Nazi regime murdered million upon millions of people in Eastern Europe and it's payback time as the red army advances into the heart of the Nazi regime . It's also interesting to note that we never see Soviet soldiers raping German women in their thousands . Again if someone with no knowledge of the period would ask why are the Soviets doing that ? And again the answer is simple - Revenge against a country /regime that was responsible for the deaths of almost 15% of the Soviet population . Don't you get the feeling the film wants to avoid awkward questions ?This type of controversy seems to be responsible for Ganz , Matthes , Hirschbiegel and the film itself being very under rewarded at international film festivals which while being slightly understandable does seem wrong . There is no doubt in my mind that Ganz deserved the Oscar for best actor that year since it's the best performance I've ever seen by a non English speaking actor in a movie . If no one discovers time travel then this will be the closest we'll find out what it was like in the days leading up to the death of history's most hated figure",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
'Grim' Look At The Nazis' Final Hours,"Wow, what a grim movie. How I stuck with this for 155 minutes, I don't know, but it's a fairly involving story once you get into it and you want to see how it's all played out.A main reason I use the word ""grim"" is that there are more scenes with people committing suicide in this movie than all the movies (thousands) I've seen put together.This German movie deals with the last days Of Hitler and the Nazis in Berlin in April of 1945. In the end, most of the people in the film either kill themselves, as mentioned, or execute their loved ones in order to avoid capture by the Russians, who overtook the city. This includes poisoning a group of young children.While not overly gory, some of the scenes are shocking, ones I suspect would linger in anyone's memory..Bruno Ganz as Adolph Hitler was intriguing, to say the least. As an American, I can recall very few, if any, films in which Hitler was shown to this degree with this much dialog. Being such a famous figure in history, it was one of the reasons, frankly, I stayed with the film. I never this man portrayed on film.Alexandra Maria Lara as ""Traudl Junge"" was the bright spot in this dismal story, a beautiful and wholesome-looking woman with an expressive face. She was the only character in the film that I cared about. Everyone else is pretty cold. Junge ""won"" the job as a secretary for Hitler and is pictured as sweet and naive woman...and just one more of the millions of victims of World War II. Victims can be survivors, too, as the story concludes, if for nothing else, for suffering with a guilty conscience for decades.This war movie definitely can be classified as ""different"" and memorable. I doubt if I'd ever watch this again, but it was worth the one viewing, that's for sure.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
A chillingly accurate portrayal of Der Führer and the fall of The Third Reich,"Adolf Hitler. The very name is enough to send a chill down your spine. Not because of what it is or was, but because of what it stands for, what we involuntarily and immediately think of when we are reminded of him. The deaths of so many people and the cause of so much evil. Now, almost sixty years after his death, we finally get a chance to see his downfall, his last hours and days... and this turns out to be a very revealing portrayal. Oliver Hirschbiegel takes what so many people have tried to turn into a monster and makes it human again, makes us believe that this man actually existed and was a man, not a beast. We see Hitler's frustration at defeat, his kindness to his employees, his refusal to accept the truth. The plot is very good, and almost completely authentic. I could only find two historical inaccuracies in the film, and that is incredible, compared to the amount of stuff that was as if taken directly from the history book or another equally reliable source. The pacing is great. I was hardly bored at any point during the film, despite it being quite long and the language spoken was one I couldn't understand(thank god for subtitles). With that said, I have to applaud this film's realism and authenticity. Every single German character in the film speaks German. There are a few scenes with Russian characters as well... and they naturally speak Russian. Not English with a poorly faked accent, like we generally see in Hollywood films. In fact, there is not really any Hollywood in the film. Just gritty, hard realism. No heroic acts that are rewarded. No 'fireball' explosions. No holding back on injuries, even when it comes to 'our heroes'. Actually, that's probably what impressed me the most(when it comes to non-Hollywood stuff in this film); there are no heroes. No one is raised above the rest, no one is pure, good and true *all the time*... no one is a hero. Everyone is a human being. The acting is flawless. Bruno Ganz is a perfect choice for Adolf Hitler. No, scratch that; THE perfect choice. You forget that you're watching an actor. You're completely absorbed by his performance. The casting was mostly spot-on, with most of the historical characters looking and acting just like they did in real life. The details are another thing that raises this film to a new level. The tiniest little things in these people's lives, the most human and typical things are presented as they are or were, in the film. Hitler's Parkinson's disease, Goebbels' slight limp, etc. Smaller details include a soldier quickly rubbing his eyes of soot and gunpowder before looking through binoculars and a brief dialog showing Hitler and his promises' effect on many Germans, even children. This is just so talented directing, it's hard to say anything negative. The editing is sharp and the cinematography is perfect. Not one shot lasts too long or ends too early. A few things were changed(from the historical record of what happened) for dramatical reasons, but it didn't bother me and probably won't be a deal-breaker for anyone else(it really shouldn't, anyway, except maybe for historians who go for nothing but authenticity and accuracy). The one thing I will say is that no one should go see this movie unless they are absolutely certain of what they're in for, when it comes to violence and realism. This is gratuitous and detailed, no holding back. Not for the faint of heart. Definitely not. Also, you will need somewhat extensive knowledge of Hitler and the people around him in that time, or you won't really understand what is going on. Read up on him or watch a Discovery Channel special first, then watch the film. I recommend this to just about anyone who can tolerate the language(I don't know if there is a dubbed version of this film, but in my honest opinion, you should stay away from any other version than the original) and the violence, and, most importantly, the idea that Hitler was a human being, not some supernatural, cold-hearted monster. 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
The Best Hitler Movie Thus Far,"I've always been fascinated with WWII history and specially Hitler's character and his motivations and inner thinking. I found this movie to be a master piece. The actor who plays Hitler has done an outstanding job. In short, the best movie about Hitler I've ever seen. I've also been particularly fascinated about what had gone on in the bunker during those last days. This movie which is supposed to be very close to reality gives a remarkable depiction of what actually went on in there. I also like the fact that the movie, very delicately, concentrates on some other seemingly ""unimportant"" characters, for example the German surgeon in the hospital.

Serious Movie making!!!,"I have seen quite many WW2 films in the past, yet very few of them managed to amaze and shock me as ""Der Untergang"" aka ""The Downfall"" did. Under Oliver Hirschbiegel's excellent direction, we watch the agonizing last hours inside Hitler's bunker, as accounted for by his young secretary Traudl Junge. We watch Hitler, in his peak of his insanity, as he awaits for imaginary troops to save him and his motherland, while his closest associates start to realize that the game is over and begin to desert him en masses. We watch Eva Braun (Juliane Kohler), who amidst the turmoil and destruction, her main preoccupation is to die looking beautiful, so she chooses the poison instead of the bullet.Few films have dared to touch WW2 objectively from a German point of view; Most of the movies are shot and told from the Allied point of view. But this movie is shot completely from the German point of view.""The Downfall"" tells the story of Fuhrer's final hours, his last critical 12 days in a fortified bunker below the Reich Chancellery in Berlin, while the Soviet Army was slowly taking over Berlin and their artillery bombarding the whole city Based on the book ""Inside Hitler's Bunker"" by Joachim Fest. ""The Downfall"" is in a word, shocking. The last act in the great horrific play of the Third Reich plays out like that of a cult so many men and woman who swore allegiance to Hitler commit suicide by either shooting themselves in the head or by ingesting poison capsules. But the madness of Hitler himself is horrifically captivating. He changes his mind and opinion on a whim. One moment he advises his SS-Guards and Generals to leave the city after learning that he does not have enough troops to protect Berlin. A particular one named Gruppenführer Hermann Fegelein , who was Eva Braun's brother-in-law, takes the Fuhrer for his word and leaves Berlin. When Hitler realizes this, he denounces Fegelein and orders him executed. What is more, Hitler discusses the final demise of the German people. He explains that this failure is not only that of the military, but of the civilians themselves. As such, his soldiers do not protect the people from the coming onslaught of the Soviet Army. He advises, ""In a war as such there are no civilians.""Hitler is recreated by the superlative performance of Bruno Ganz, who appeared in the 2004 remake of ""The Manchurian Candidate."" Ganz captures the movement, voice, even the involuntary shaking of Hitler's left hand so well, that the audience would feel as if they are watching the dictator himself. We are often left with shivers down our spine at how realistic Ganz's depiction is.It is amazing to see how wonderful country like Germany survived to the chaos, destruction and lack of command, arrived from the ashes like Phoenix and sixty years later is again one of the greatest nations. And for those who love war, I really recommend to watch this magnificent anti-war movie, and see the behavior of the leaders and population when a war is lost.""The Downfall"" is an impressive and brilliant piece of film making and ingenuity. The film is completely in German so do not forget to get a DVD which has English sub titles unless of course you are well versed in German.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
A must to see,"I saw the movie last week in an overcrowded cinema and was surprised about the outstanding actors (Bruno Ganz and Corinna Harfouch) , the perfect screenplay (Bernd Eichinger) and the work of director Oliver Hirschbiegel.What happened on the screen gave the closest insight into the darkest part of German history and the darkest corners of human nature.The movie shows the human being Hitler as that monster and mad man he was. And no one else as he himself destroys and demystifies his 'legend'. Based strictly on historical facts and dialogs the movie shows, why The Downfall (Der Untergang) had to happen.One of the most harrowing scene is, when Magda Goebels kills her six children cold blooded. The camera does not turn away and shows the details of cruelty to make clear, what this kind of blind fanaticism leads to. Many scenes are really hard to bear but they are necessary to tell the story.There are many discussions around the world right now and many ask, if Hitler should be shown as a human being and if Germany should look back on its past that way. I am convinced, that after you have seen the movie, the answer will be yes. The characters on the screen are no role models for Nazis of today. No one of the perpetrators become victims. The screenplay describes but it never explains. What happens on the screen explains itself.I am sure 'The Downfall' is of international interest and will be an international success.A must to see.Greetings from Dirk, Munich, Germany",,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Good acting but perhaps a bit too soft on Hitler,"Overall, the movie has good storytelling. The acting is solid and the whole war sequence is well- filmed. The only downside perhaps is that Hitler is represented in a more humane light than he likely deserves. It appears that the idea was to show him from the eyes of his followers, which the movie achieves but there is little coverage of his hateful ideology and quite a bit of romanticizing. As a viewer, I continued to be puzzled by his halo effect on those around him.Obviously his character continues to be a bit of a mystery in the sense that so many romanticized him and did not truly acknowledge the extent of terror that his regime inflicted- some even to this day. It does appear that people will continue to look for false messiahs- and he must have been the proverbial ""wolf in sheep's clothing"" to his followers and much worse to everyone else.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
In a war as such there are no civilians.,"Despite it's 2 1/2 to 3 hour length, Oliver Hirschbiegel's film never slows for one second. This is a testament to his brilliant direction.What is also brilliant is the acting of Bruno Ganz as Adolph Hitler. I have never seen such emotion brought to a role.What really impresses is the stark realism of the film. You actually feel as if you are there when the Nazi world is crumbling.Another great aspect of the film is seeing the humanism of the people. Some were thoroughly consumed with the Nzai madness, some were in a trance with their love of Hitler, and some, like Albert Speer, actually defied his orders. All were aghast at his madness at the end.This film is a must-see ans I wish that it could be shown in High Schools across America to show the reality of aggression. The utter disdain for the people of Germany was so evident throughout that it was scary.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Very authentic story of Hitler and the End of the third Reich,"Being interested in war movie I decided to buy this DVD because I was all the time wondering what really happened in the last days with the Führer. My high expectations have been fulfilled and I will add this Oscar nominated work for best foreign language film no doubt to my best of DVD collection. It's fast paced with lot of emotional, dramatic and action scenes and I never got bored. Sometimes I had even to laugh on some ridiculous decisions of Hitler. I have to admit that there were perhaps too many bloody suicides in this story. Anyway, director Hirschbiegel shows in a very authentic way the dramatic end of the third Reich. I am also surprised how great Bruno Ganz was in characterizing Hitler so deep and with its voice.

Too realistic to arise some interest,"I have just watched the film, and I have the impression that this film do not deserve to be in the top 250 movies. I think it is a good and realistic portrait of Adolf Hitler's last days, and all the madness that surrounded him. I utterly disagree with those who say this film gives a pro-Nazi vision. I have paid much attention more than two hours and I haven't found the slightest sign of Nazi Propaganda in this film. But I was willing to watch a film and what I found was a documentary. And I am not happy with that. The film didn't arose my interest at most points. Why? Mainly because it is too long, it's more of a documentary than a film, and doesn't add any interesting special feature to make it more interesting. I particularly don't feel any suspense during the film. What I am trying to say is that when you are doing a film about something people already know (most people know a lot about Hitler and particularly that he committed suicide)you have to add something to the film to make it interesting, or to add your personal view to an historical event. And none of these things have been done in the present film. Therefore, I see this film more as a boring documentary than as a film.",4.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

"Outstanding, amazing, spellbinding","History tells us that Hitler was a great orator, a charismatic leader who held millions spellbound. Downfall follows that same role model as it paints a gripping, harrowing last few days of Adolf Hitler in his bunker in Berlin as the Russians close in..Still in charge, but barely there in mind or body, it almost seems that as the country collapsed around him, Hitler himself disintegrated. The movie is amazingly real, thanks to an amazing performance by Bruno Ganz as Adolf Hitler. The set detail, the storyline and all the supporting cast of characters is just about perfect. I could not fault this movie at all. You feel as if you are witnessing history unfold before your very eyes. To the end, despite his state of health, Hitler believed in his ""ethnic cleansing"" policy, appeared delusional in his belief that somehow he could lead Germany to victory over the allies.The story itself is based on facts recounted by one of Hitler's close secretaries, Traudl Jung who managed to live through the war and survived to tell her account of the story.This is clearly a great film of an important subject matter and director Oliver Hirschbiegel has crafted an amazing celluloid masterpiece of a man whose all-encompassing hatred and passion for the Jews literally drove him insane and to his ghastly death.Some emotionally powerful moments in the movie involving mass suicide or murder will mean that the movie may not appeal to all fans. This is a must-see movie for fans of cinema.

der Untergang - the donwfall of Hitler and his third Reich,"If anything was horrifying, it must have been the years in which Hitler reigned over Germany, especially during World War II. Nothing has been more commented on, almost everybody knows what happened during his reign. So when people decided that movies ought to be made to show us the hows, whens and whats, these were made. Unfortunately, Nazi-Germans spoke English, as they were played by Americans and Englishmen. It was very easy to qualify the German people as 'evil'. Now, after 60 years, we see the story from the inside. Little by little we understand that the German people suffered as much as anybody suffered from the terror used by the Nazi-regime. Bruno Ganz may well have played the role of his life, I have never seen an actor playing Hitler so realistically, showing him being normal, frightening, aggressive and mad. This movie, showing the WWII from a non-allied point of view, is a must for all those who easily speak of Germans, when they mean Nazis.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Superb,"Not since the 1981 release of ""Das Boot"" has a German film had such an impact on audiences witnessing, from a German point of view, the perception, judgement,interpretation and opinion on its own history. ""Downfall"" tells the true story of the last days of the third Reich (April 1945), from within Hitlers secret underground bunker situated in the heart of Berlin.3/4 of the film is set inside the scope of the claustrophobic and confined concrete bunker world of Adolf Hitler during his last weeks alive. The film also show a glimpse of central Berlin in its besieged and confused state during the Soviet onslaught. Inside the bunker we see Hitler's decay, he goes from calmness to rage, from understanding to paranoia, from irrational to total deluded. He gives his generals and field commandos ( there was no grand admirals present in the bunker at this time of the war) orders that are not compatible with reality or fact. He tries to control armies that do not exist anymore or order companies to counter-attack that only featuring on a map. A large majority of his high ranking commanding officers sense, and have done for 8-months, the war is lost on the side of Germany. However, some still believe in final victory in idealistic faculties. This is played out on screen with nervous tension. In addition, the few scenes set outside the bunker bring across a population confused, scarred, exhausted. Some however are continuing to display courage in valiantly defending the city and show continuously hopeless resistance in the face of the advancing red army (1st Belarussian army)bought on by years of Nazi propaganda.The film magnificently achieves to bring to screen the combination of Traudi Junges ( Hitlers private secretary) memoirs, Nazi officials memoirs, German war archives and the documentary ""blind spot"" to a conclusion on screen.Bruno Ganz brings the fuhrer to life in his exceptionally good performance. Alexandria Maria Lara plays the role of Traudi Junge has a young confused,aroused and obsolete to the truth citizen of the third Reich. All the members of the cast gives excellently rehearsed and researched performances to life. Ulrich Noether was a perfect likeness to Himmler.""Downfall"" is a remarkable history lesson on the second world war in Europe. It holds the attention of the audience through out. The film never side tracking away for long enough, in which it sets the sense of calmness, peace and normality, to lose sight of the unbearable reality of the situation.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Chilling,"April 1945. The Allies are marching towards Berlin. Within his hidden, reinforced bunker, Adolf Hitler celebrates his 56th birthday. A few days later he will commit suicide, heralding the end of World War Two. This is the story of those few days, largely based on the memoirs of Traudl Junge, Hitler's personal secretary.A provocative subject, if nothing else. Especially because it takes the bold step to portray Hitler as a human being. A horrible, twisted and utterly racist human being, who has been given way too much power. But a human being, nonetheless. A point of view that is much rarer than you'd think. It's actually a common joke that the first thing you should do with a time machine is to go and prevent Hitler from being born. Yet at the same time it is a widely accepted theory that Germany would have rebelled and started another war even without this one man from Austria-Hungary. Perhaps it would not have been such a large war, and it's quite likely that the Jews would not have suffered so greatly. But Europe would have bled.Still, even this Hitler is very much a caricature . Bruno Granz plays him in a way that to me speaks of wanting to distance himself from the character. His Hitler is a ruin. A stuttering, shaking shell of a man, human only in form. Granted, this has some basis in reality, based on multiple accounts of those final days in the bunker. Still, this Hitler would be a pitiful sight, if he wasn't who he is.And perhaps that's the point. Hitler's evils were horrible and devastating in nature, but they weren't the result of some outside force, cosmic imbalance or anything else like that. We're not given that comfort. Rather they were the result of human nature. Which is a bitter truth to swallow, but a necessary one.An interesting movie and recommended for fans of war and period films. High production values, good acting, tense atmosphere and a subject matter that isn't examined that often.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Sympathetic Without Crossing The Line,"Traudl Junge, the final secretary for Adolf Hitler (Bruno Ganz), tells of the Nazi dictator's final days in his Berlin bunker at the end of WWII.The difficulty of any film focused on Germany during World War II is how to portray the humanity of the people without sympathizing with the Nazi cause. One does not want to make Hitler out to be human (although he was), but it is also unfair to paint an entire country as monsters.The Hollywood cliché is that German soldiers were cruel and ruthless, but were they? Here we have Hitler's secretary, who saw much of the last days. If anyone can be said to be both inside the circle and yet innocent, it is her. If we are to believe the real Traudl Junge, such decisions as regarded concentration camps were never made known to her. She was a secretary, but apparently not typing up the most terrible documents.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Nice elaboration on the final days of the Fuhrer,"The story rolls out very nicely, Having most of the scenes done in the bunker setting makes this movie prone to being boring at some point of its more than two hour duration. But this movie handled it well by depicting striking images and great shocking moments. What's lacking in my opinion is that the war scenes don't really get the real war aura, especially after we see what's done in Saving Private Ryan. But then again, the main focus of Hitler's surroundings on his final days at the bunker really captivated me as I watched this movie. Bruno Ganz acted out nicely in this movie. Before I see this movie, I have seen parodies of the angry Hitler scenes here and there and I wondered what movie was those from. Now that I found the original movie, it makes sense why people choose Ganz's Hitler character as the closest to the real person.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Don't be fooled by the cinematic excellence - Downfall is dangerous,"As far as films go, Downfall is excellent. The acting by all concerned, particularly of Bruno Ganz as Hitler, is inspired. The reconstruction of Hitler's bunker and of the atmosphere within and without it in the last days of the war, so far as anyone can judge, is very realistic and convincing. The script, which draws on two separate historical documents recording Hitler's final days, is well constructed, and the directing of the entire film is on the whole is immaculate.However, some films are more than mere vehicles for entertainment. Downfall is arguably one of the most important World War II films ever made for one simple reason  it is a German film. That a German director should finally decide to tackle this subject is itself commendable but the resulting film, though excellent in itself, leaves much to be desired. In fact, it is potentially dangerous. Downfall has won world wide acclaim, and audiences around the world were moved by the portrayal of the Nazi high command as vulnerable human beings and not dehumanised monsters. Unfortunately, by allowing the film to do so, audiences around the world are being duped into believing one of the most spectacular myths post war Germany has concocted about the relationship between the German people, its army, and the Nazi party led by Hitler. While not excusing the Germans' support of Hitler, the film is meant to make the German people feel better about themselves by spreading the myth that Hitler was mad, the army and its generals heroic, and most of Hitler's staff either ignorant of Germany's inhuman war crimes, or somehow conflicted about their role in the War. This utter nonsense shies away from taking responsibility for the true horrors of WWII. A German film focusing on the war could have focused on any part of it. Did the director choose to depict the rise of the Nazi party to power? Did he choose to portray the horrors of Crystal Nacht and the rise of institutionalised anti-Semitism? Did he choose to focus on the unprovoked invasion of Poland, or the Final Solution for the 'problem' of European Jews? No. The director chose to focus on the final days of the war when the Nazis may be portrayed as vulnerable and as a confused band of misguided dreamers who put their faith is a madman who led them to destruction. This view of historical events is not only disturbing but frighteningly worrying coming from a German director, even though it is predictable. The only way most young Germans today can cope with their past is to convince themselves of this myth; to convince themselves that their grandparents were all young Traudl Junges swept into the Nazi mania out of ignorance, fear, poverty, and a sense of national shame after the surrender of World War I, which, incidentally, the Germans also started. But just because the Germans need to believe in this to get on with their lives in modern-day Europe doesn't mean the rest of the world has to buy into it. Just like the memoirs of Miss Junge on which this film is based, the resulting film is just that - a subjective impression coloured by guilt, denial, and self-loathing. To hail it as historically accurate, objective, and self-examining is reckless and foolish.A case in point is the portrayal of Speer. Speer was one of Hitler's closest confidants, and a key architect of the Final Solution. He was a rabid fascist, anti-Semite, who laid the architectural plans for all of the Third Reich's future centers of powers. During the Nuremberg Trials Speers pleaded ignorance of the Nazi Death Camps and claimed he was only an 'architect' of buildings. While the other caught Nazis were executed, Speer received a light prison sentence. He was eventually released and died of old age in the comfort of his home. Historians for a long time since then have exposed Speer's lies. It is a well established fact that he hoodwinked his captors and got away with what very few of the Nazis did. But the film embraces Speer's benign and false self portrayal as a mild-mannered, sympathetic man who attempts to convince Hitler to surrender and is really little more than an over zealous designer of buildings.Downfall is a very good film. But audiences should not be fooled by its oblique propaganda. Moving on and allowing modern day Germans to cope with their past is one thing  but to promote the idea that the entire war was the fault of one very unstable man is dangerously absurd. One of the film's tag lines, spoken by the real life Traudl Junge, is that 'being young is not an excuse'; well that's just not good enough. It is only when the Germans look themselves in the mirror and confront the harsh reality of their history that the rest of the world could maybe one day move on and forgive while never forgetting.",5.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
The best movie portrayal of Adolf Hitler ever?,"There have been hundreds of actors over the years who have portrayed Adolf Hitler but I'm pretty sure there has been no better depiction of the Nazi leader than the one done by Bruno Ganz. This is a brilliant film about the final hours of Hitler, his foot soldiers and the people who worked and lived around him in his bunker.Unlike most war films this is a German made movie with German actors and this gives this so much more authenticity. Not surprisingly this was nominated for an Oscar and i have no doubt if this had been an American film , Bruno Ganz would have won the best actor award.There is one heartbreaking scene where Magda Goebbels gives her children poison while they are asleep and it just goes to show how far some of the top Nazi's would go not to surrender under any circumstances. Downfall is one of the best films i have seen about the end of WWII and if you the slightest bit interested in what happened in that infamous bunker you have to see this film.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Human crimes,"The Nazi regime and everything associated with it has been demonized in the past six decades up to a point where it is truly hard for a layperson to have a fairly realistic view of how things were. Don't get me wrong: every bit of the moral condemnation is fully deserved and necessary to be made.However, we have to understand, that Nazis were just as human as any regular guy. It wasn't demons, or Satan or some unimaginable evil that has committed those crimes- they were people, cruel & despicable people, but otherwise having the same feelings, fears & uncertainties as any one of us. Attributing demonic powers to the enemy is never a good way to understand; and you might say who wants to understand such a thing?; but there is no other way to learn from the past- or from anything else for that matter- then trying to be realistic instead of dismissing.We HAVE to condemn crimes that have taken place; but we have to condemn them for the right reasons; only after medicine has learned that diseases are caused by microorganisms, genetics etc. rather then by evil spirits that it was able to treat them. It is only if we accept that the nazi crimes(and many others before & after) were the results of deeply human processes that we can hope to avoid them in the future.This is what I think this movie transmits to us.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Incredible look into Hitler's final days,"Having heard many positive reviews of ""The Downfall,"" I expected a unique and interesting film when I watched the opening scenes. By the time the credits began to roll, I was taken aback by how incredible it turned out to be.To begin, Bruno Ganz as Adolf Hitler absolutely makes this film what it is. At certain times throughout the film I had forgotten that an actor was playing him, and actually thought I was watching the real person. His demeanor, personality shifts, loud outbursts, even facial expressions are so dead on it's incredible. In fact, the entire cast as a whole delivers an extraordinary performance. It is clear that careful thought went into the selection of actors/actresses.The film tells the grim story of Hitler and his right-hand men during the last days of his life. We see a man grow increasingly insane as he refuses to accept the ultimate end of his lifetime goal. We also see the differences in the characters around him, some believing in his ideas until death, some showing the slightest ounce of disbelief in the world around them. It offers an extraordinary look into the past, a first hand look into the mind of Hitler, and takes a concept that has been tried hundreds of times before and makes it right.Simply put, ""The Downfall"" is a must see film that will leave you curious and intrigued for days after the final credits roll.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Straightforward But Very Powerful,"There's nothing particularly earth-shattering from a historical perspective here. It's simply the faithfully recounted story of the last 10 days of Adolf Hitler's life in the Bunker beneath the Chancellery. The basic story has been told before in 1981's ""The Bunker"" which starred Anthony Hopkins as Hitler, but although I thought that was well done, this is far superior, primarily because of the frighteningly superb performance of Bruno Ganz as Hitler. He became ""der Fuhrer"" in this movie. He was completely convincing, and offered a more complex portrayal than Hopkins' version. In this movie Hitler shifts between being a charming boss to his secretaries, even sometimes being self-deprecating with them (he says to a nervous Traudl Junge on her first day ""I make a lot of mistakes; you won't make as many as I do"") to being maniacal and out-of control, raging against the betrayals of his colleagues and the failures (in his eyes) of his generals. Brilliant. Alexandra Maria Lara was almost as convincing as Junge. Her character seems to be what ties the movie together (and the movie begins and ends with actual footage of the real Junge being interviewed for the also fascinating documentary ""Im Totem Winkel."") There was also an interesting portrayal of the Goebbels, and especially Magda Goebbels (Corinna Harfounch) as she struggles with her conscience at the decision to murder her five children. The setting was realistic; the atmosphere totally believable. I appreciated as well that the movie painted a pretty good picture of what life was like outside the bunker, as we see street-fighting against the Russians, largely involving the Hitler Youth, who were the only ones left to defend the city after the collapse of Germany's armies. The cowardice of Hitler's generals and other officers was clearly shown as well. They obviously know that the war is over and Germany defeated, yet to the end they won't stand up to their demonic leader. This is truly one of the most powerful movies I've seen in a long time. 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
"A humanizing, but not justifying, portrayal of Hitler","Downfall (2004)
Cast: Bruno Ganz, Alexandra Maria Lara, Corinna Harfouch, Ulrich MatthesIt may seem like something impossible for a filmmaker to do, but director Oliver Hirschbiegel was able to make a humanizing portrayal of Hitler, but not a film that justifies or denies the atrocities that Hitler and the Nazis committed. Yes, the film does show his crazy side (how he still thought he could win in the war in 1945, his plan to rebuild Berlin), but also shows how he was capable of love for animals, especially his pet dog. To me, this is a sign of a great filmmaker, one who can make a film about one of the worst people ever, show they have a human side, and yet not justify their evil actions. The actor who played HItler also gave a great performance.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Shockingly Realistic and Moving,"Downfall launches the viewer head-on into the last moments of the Reich in Berlin, 1945. It doesn't patronise the viewer with an explanatory voice over it is unflinchingly real. Ganz's performance as Hitler is terrific he manages to capture the sense of terror and awe that the real-life counter part had. The supporting cast are also superb portraying the sense of utter loss and crushed belief as the seemingly invincible idea of Germania collapses around them. This film has been criticised for humanising the Nazis, particularly Hitler but I find this to be it's strongest point. Unlike most war films the Germans are shown as human, they have emotions, they weep as their children die and their leader weeps as his monstrous scheme dies. The film really portrays the manner in which the German people were swept up with National Socialism, they lived and died for it. It also captures the terrifying will to power which the Nazis used so inhumanely over the 'weak' which even turn out to be the German civilians after a while. All in all a moving and shockingly realistic portrayal of a legacy which still haunts us to this day.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
extremely impressive,"I have seen the movie today and I must say, it is the most impressive German movie since ""The boat"".Hitler, Goebbels with his wife Magda, the generals Keitel and Jodl and the other leading Nazis are surrounded in Berlin by Russian troops a few days before the end of the war in europe. They commit suicide, fight and die or try to escape.The film was narrated out of the sight of the young girl, which was Hitlers secretary, Traudl Junge. As far as I know, the movie make only a few little historic mistakes (not important), the film is mainly based of the memories of Junge. She survived and died two years ago in 2002.Swiss actor Bruno Ganz plays Hitler in a realistic way which nobody else has played before. The film shows the madness of Hitler and his inner circle in the last days of WWII. For example directly before he kills himself Hitler married his girlfriend Eva Braun. And the registrar asked really, if Hitler has his identity card and if he is really no Jew, because it is official regulation. Goebbels have to remember the officer that he is talking to Hitler...!""Untergang"" concentrates on a few persons: Hitler, Junge, Magda Goebbels, who killed her own children with poison and some other. So some important Nazis are not detailed enough, perhaps that the weakness of the film. But the main persons are played so intensive, its more than enough for a legendary movie.Besides the film has one of the best sounds I have ever heard. It makes war as real as movies can. Perhaps only the first minutes of ""Private Ryan"" can compare with it. Thats why I tell everybody: Don't look it from DVD, but in a theater.Germany has decided to nominate ""Der Untergang"" for the Academy Award (Foreign language). That's why there must be an English version, whether with subtitles or dubbed. And the German producer and screenplay-writer Bernd Eichinger (Producer: The Name of the Rose, Resident Evil, House of the spirits) is experienced enough to do this in the right way.Harald Paumer",,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Not all that great,"I probably am the only person that didn't really like this movie. There was nothing surprising in it for me. Hitler was not more of a man to me what so ever. His puppets weren't more human to me. There were a few good points in the movie though. The actors were great, the scenes were very good. However, nothing of that could make me change my mind. It was all exactly how I imagined his end must have been like.A really good movie is a movie that makes you think about things, brings on new perspectives, maybe even makes you change your mind. It did nothing like that for me.There was nothing there that one could not have learned in a history class, on the internet, in a book, on discovery channel, or where ever.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Re : Der Untergang,"This was an excellent film, one of the best I have seen. I saw it in Berlin a couple of times ( in German ) when it first came out, and now have the DVD. Have also read the book. Just one comment I have to make which no-one else seems to have picked up on so far. In the scene where Hitler is presenting the Iron Crosses to members of the Hitler Youth in the Reichs Chancellery garden, he is introduced by a man in the brown uniform of the Hitler Youth, Artur Axmann, Reichsjugendfuehrer. Axmann salutes and gives the Nazi Gruess with his RIGHT arm. However, according to my information Artur Axmann was wounded on the first day of the attack on the Soviet Union, 22nd July 1941, when he lost an arm. And as far as I can make out from photographs of Axmann I have seen, the arm he lost was the RIGHT one. So he should have saluted with his LEFT hand.I am not 100% certain of this, but I wonder whether there is any further information on this point.What do the film makers have to say about it ?Also, I am anxious to obtain the song "" Blutrote Rosen "" by the Marek Weber Orchestra, which is played in the film when Eva Braun is dancing in the Reichs Chancellery. I know that the recording is available on the CD of the film, but I don't want to purchase the entire film soundtrack. Can anyone tell me where I can obtain the record ( preferably on CD ) of this song without having to buy the film soundtrack ?Terry Moody.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
"A good movie, but way too long.","Der Untergang, does what no other WWII movie has ever done before, it makes you look a Hitler as a human being. And that makes it even stronger, when you realize that this tired, worn out man was responsible for the deaths of 5 million Jews. Bruno Ganz playing Hitler is phenomenal, and casting and acting is generally what makes the movie so memorable.But then why a 7? simply put it's way to long. It shouldn't have been longer then 90 min. It repeats itself a lot, all of Hitlers meetings with his generals is surely to show how he wouldn't accept reality, but that is not something we need repeated that many times. As goes for a lot of other scenes. I like the movie, but I think the length is killing it. I simply do not feel like watching it again.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
A bravura piece of storytelling,"The story of Hitler's last days in the Berlin bunker is a riveting, almost factual piece of film-making that feels more like a documentary than a movie. Despite the lengthy running time, DOWNFALL is never less than gripping thanks to the stark realism and depth of character present at all times.It certainly makes for uncomfortable viewing in that it gets you sympathising with the top Nazi officials on multiple occasions. Even Hitler himself seems, well, human. That's the genius of DOWNFALL: it avoids painting characters in black and white terms of good and evil, instead showing that the German commanders were only misguided people after all.Most WW2 movies adopt Allied perspectives of the war, so I found this to be a refreshing change of pace. The movie is expertly shot and acted, emphasising subtlety throughout. The cameraman sits back and lets the cast do their jobs, and what jobs! Bruno Ganz (NOSFERATU THE VAMPYRE) is brilliant as Hitler, and everyone else ups their ante to rival his turn. By turns moving and horrific, disturbing and poignant, DOWNFALL is a mature, engrossing and reflective piece of storytelling.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
"Menschlich, Allzu Menschlich","It has sometimes been said that because men no longer believed in the Devil, God created Adolf Hitler to serve as a symbol of absolute evil. This film, which tells the story of the last few days of World War II in Europe, largely seen from the perspective of Hitler and members of his inner circle as the victorious Russian army approaches the gates of Berlin, avoids that concept and tries to show us Hitler the man rather than Hitler the devil. It has been criticised in some circles for that approach, but in my opinion the criticism is not a valid one. Hitler was precisely that- a man, no less human for also being evil. We will never succeed in understanding the crimes of the Nazis if we persist in trying to see Hitler as the spawn of Satan or as some bizarre, inhuman alien being. He was, in Nietzsche's words, menschlich, allzu menschlich. (Human, all too human).To make someone seem human is not necessarily to make them seem sympathetic, but we must remember that Hitler had succeeded in obtaining more than 40% of the vote in free elections, had won the fanatical loyalty of millions of Germans and had succeeded in retaining the loyalty of many of them even when it seemed obvious that his cause was lost. (We see some of that loyalty reflected in the film, especially among the fanatical young soldiers prepared to fight to the death). If he had been an obviously evil psychopath he would never have done any of those things, but would have remained the leader of a tiny movement on the lunatic fringe of German politics, winning the loyalty of only a small fraternity of kindred spirits. He could not have succeeded without possessing immense reserves of charm and charisma.This film tries to show some of the characteristics which helped Hitler in his rise to power. We see him being kind to his secretary, Traudl Junge, on whose memoirs the film was partly based, affable and friendly to the young soldiers he decorates for their desperate acts of bravery, affectionate to his dog Blondi and loving to his mistress Eva Braun. (We like to think that, sexually, Hitler must have been either abnormally perverted or abnormally repressed because we do not like the idea that so monstrous an individual had a fairly mundane sex life, a monogamous heterosexual relationship with an attractive blonde girlfriend).We do, of course, see far more of the opposite side of his character. By the end of the war Hitler had lost all contact with reality, and when we first see him he is unrealistically optimistic, believing that the German army will still succeed in driving the Allies back, issuing commands to non-existent fighting units and even congratulating himself on his strategic skill which has led the enemy into a trap. Later, when even he cannot deny the imminence of defeat, he falls into self-pity, raging against the cruelty of fate or against the German people who have proved unworthy of him. We see that he was not only brutal towards his own enemies but also completely callous towards his own people, refusing to surrender and not caring how many more lives might be lost. The role of Hitler must be one of the most difficult that any actor could be called on to play, but Bruno Ganz meets the challenge magnificently. He meets the physical demands of the role, bringing out Hitler's strong Austrian accent and the paralysed arm tucked behind his back. (Hitler had been injured in a failed assassination attempt the previous year). More importantly, he also rises to its emotional demands, showing the mixture of reckless optimism and despair, impotent rage, hatred and and self-pity which characterised the Fuehrer in his last days. The one thing, however, that Hitler never does is to express any sort of contrition for his crimes, which means that although he is human he is never pitiable.We also see the moral blindness of the rest of Hitler's circle. The most chilling is Corinna Harfouch's portrayal of Magda Goebbels, wife of the infamous propaganda minister, who calmly poisons her own children because she does not want them to grow up in a world without National Socialism. Himmler, as deluded as his leader, vainly hopes that he can negotiate a separate peace with the Western powers that will leave him in power. Albert Speer, more realistic, sees that the war is lost and tries in vain to persuade Hitler to surrender, but he too fails to realise that it is the crimes of the Nazis, in which he played his part, that have brought this disaster upon Germany. Some relief is provided by Alexandra Maria Lara as the naive young Traudl; we also see excerpts from interviews with the real Traudl Junge towards the end of her life, when she confesses that neither her youth nor her naivety can excuse her failure to realise the true nature of the regime she served.This is a bleak, grim film, set against scenes of a ruined city, with an ever-present sense of death and destruction. It is, however, a brave and powerful film which should be seen not only by anyone with an interest in the history of the Second World War but also by anyone who wants to understand the roots of human evil. No-one who has really watched it could make the mistake of considering it pro-Nazi. Oliver Hirschbiegel is to be congratulated for confronting this dark chapter in his nation's history with such courage and honesty. Congratulations are also due to Channel 4 for flying in the face of the British public's normal disdain for foreign-language films when they recently showed this important film at peak evening viewing time. 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Great movie.,"This movie probably provides the best dramatic treatment of Adolf Hitler. Unlike other movies that tend to present Hitler as a caricature, this movie opts to portray Hitler as a historical person and not as a clown. Although it is easy to reduce Hitler to a subject for mockery, this movie avoids that temptation and instead presents an Adolf Hitler the person whose actions are made even more sinister, baffling and amazing by the sheer banality of his existence. In this movie Hitler is shown not as a hysteric, not as the bombastic political actor, leader and rabble rouser familiar in all too many documentaries, but as a frail, broken, disillusioned man whose dreams have been shattered and whose closest advisers have all but abandoned him. Yet, even as Hitler himself realizes that his demise is all but inevitable, the movie shows how the cohort of secretaries, clerks and party flunkies who formed Hitler's personal staff refused to leave him and opted to stay with the Fuhrer to the bitter end. This level of devotion to a failed and doomed head of state is perhaps unprecedented in history. While the Third Reich was crumbling they stayed with the man who was responsible for the destruction of their country. Yet the same man who was capable of ordering the conquest of entire countries and the extermination of entire peoples was also capable of individual acts of kindness that makes his career all the more baffling to the audience. Can the personality and career of Adolf Hitler ever be fully explained? Maybe not, but this excellent movie at least provides a plausible glimpse of what Hitler may have been about and how his dreams of new world order came crashing down.Also, special mention must be made of Bruno Ganz's uncanny resemblance to Adolf Hitler. Mr. Ganz gives what has to be the most outstanding cinematic portrayal of Adolf Hitlee. Mr. Ganz succeeds in portraying Hitler as a caricature and instead provides a credible and even-handed portrayal of a person whose actions have been the cause for the kind of scorn and mockery that obscures who Hitler was as a man.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Great Movie,"An excellent movie. Finally, a movie that transmits the bunker mentality. Many films have failed to deliver this impression. This movie is accurate, well written and thoughtful. The scene of the death of the Goebbles children is beyond reproduction. This is how it must have happened. The last scene, with Junge leaving the Russians without interference is amazing. If you want true, historical cinema about the end of the Reich, look no further. This movie is a most for those who teach history. The opening scene re-enacts the famous photograph of Hitler handing out crosses to youngsters. His hands trembling with paralysis. Also, the role of the those who hung ""deserters"" is vivid. The old man in the cap, who hangs the innocent, yet hides from the red army is all so real.",,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
The fall and decline of the Third Reich,"The whole story of Hitler's downfall is told through the eyes of his former secretary Traudl Junge. It starts with her selection, and while another woman born and raised in Berlin is dismissed in an instant, she is chosen because of her Bavarian background (Hitler was born in Austria, not far from Bavaria). She died in 2002 and in the documentary I'm toten Winkel - Hitlers Sekretärin / Blind Spot - Hitler's Secretary she is interviewed and the script of Der Untergang / Downfall is also based on that interview. The problem I have with her is that I just can not believe her naivety. Yes, she admits in the end of Der Untergang (taken from that documentary) that she should have known better. But I personally still believe that she knew better but went along and this movie and the documentary suggest there are some people defending or at least believing her.This is the most expensive German production ever made and it shows. Especially the sound and sound editing works impressive as we have the bombing and fighting always going on in the foreground or background. Every time a person considers the bunker as an ordinary place to live, a sound (loud or soft) can be heard. The confined space within the bunker is also what makes this work with the opportunity to make shots of the long central hall where a lot of drama can be viewed with a distant camera-eye. By letting the viewer spend such amount of time in the bunker the restrictions and drama becomes only clearer. The war outside is used to create the contrast with the relative tranquility within and to show the difference between the suffering of the people and the madman inside that never once cared for them in the end. But the action outside is too sketchy, most characters are anonymous so it makes it hard to identify with any of them. This isn't on the level of Saving Private Ryan, by now the standard for war movies.With Hirschbiegel's background as TV-man this is a well made documentary dressed as fiction, but that alone does not make cinema. There are a couple of scenes that reach that level: Speer shown in the end in front of one of his own neo-classical buildings, a boy walks from a battle scene and we hear gunfire only to find out seconds later it is the typewriter of the secretary, the readings of the letters of the females intertwined with the suicidal deaths of a male and female SS-soldier.The fall of empires never comes unexpectedly, and although such regimes do not disappear in an instant, they ultimately dissolve in a few days. As the end nears, Hitler is shown increasingly as an idiot losing all sense for reality and giving random orders, appointments, and still decorating soldiers. The only thing important to him is dog-like loyalty. From his loyal followers we see a range of reactions: From the true believer Goebbels, sacrificing his whole family and his own forces, to the pragmatic Himmler, the loyal (but not to every price) Speer and the human Schenck.Hitler did what the Germans demanded from him. He was a simple man with a humble background and limited capabilities who luckily failed in what he tried to accomplish. He saw Stalin as more ruthless, which to an extent is historically true, although their atrocities are of the same proportions.This movie stays close to the known facts, and is therefore interesting as a history lesson. But for those familiar with all facts this is only an annotation, and for those not familiar it lacks a proper introduction in all the characters. Unfortunately it may send the wrong message: showing Hitler (perfectly acted by Bruno Ganz) as just a human being (soft spoken, animal lover and a vegetarian, all true by the way) it may be an attractive document for neo-Nazis too. So, to what end was this made, because there could be a somewhat stronger message like Hirschbiegel's Das Experiment has.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
One of the best foreign films of the year,"Quite simply, the story of Downfall is of the final days of the third Reich, held up in a bunker in the center of Berlin, as Adolf Hitler and his closest minions go deeper into the hole they've dug for themselves (told through the perspective, for the most part, of Hitler's last secretary Traudl Junge). I'm not sure if it is a great film or not on a first viewing, as it is a highly emotional experience along with it being intellectual at times. It's a complex film with a specific look, and the documentary-style that borders sometimes on being too much (depending on the viewer).One aspect of the film right off that fascinated me was the look. Director Hirschbiegel and DP Rainer Klaussman give scenes (I'm not certain all of them) a certain yellow-greenish tint. Perhaps this world we are seeing is meant to look like a sort of death, in a sickly kind of hue inside and outside the bunker. Or, this is just part of the style of the camera, which is often hand-held, and meant to have a Saving Private Ryan approach to the horrors of warfare. The details of most of the victims (many of which not innocent) of battle wounds or suicides are not sugar-coated with any kind of hyper-kinetic style. It's very straightforward, and all the more shocking. When Hirschbiegel shoots a pan across people (sometimes Children) that are already dead, it's certainly far more jarring than could be expected. Spielberg may try for the gritty, 'no-holds-barred' direction of the horrors of war and Nazism, a filmmaker from the country of its origin has a certain advantage.The story that unfolds in Downfall is of course a doomed one at the start (doomed for everyone in the story, the Nazis and the un-seen millions of victims of Europe included). It would be one thing for the filmmakers to punch up the story of Hitler's demise with melodrama, however an aspect to the film that doesn't cheat the audience (German, American, or otherwise) is that the story is somehow objective on one level, and on another tries to find someone to connect with. Hitler (played by Wim Wenders regular Bruno Ganz) is the key character to the story, but by making the protagonist the secretary the story does have something of a portal for a viewer amid the lot of crazed, trapped characters.Hitler is certainly the cold-blooded, Nietzsche-influenced Fuhrer of the lot, and others such as Eva Braun and the Goebbels are proof that what Hitler had in him was infectious not just with his nation at the outset, but also with his closest followers. His generals argue over what to do. The Russians are closing in. Eva throws a birthday party like it's nobody's business, despite bombs coming through the windows. Nazi commanders turn their backs on the Fuhrer one by one, adding to Hitler's ultimate hypocrisy. One brief exchange between two soldiers that caught my attention went as such, ""Where should we go?"" ""I don't know; some place where we're needed.""Speaking of content, I must come to the point of the performances. While some actors in the soldier roles and female parts were well-cast and notable - Alexandra Maria Lara as Traudl is not too forced, though one may not always find her as sympathetic as the film tries to represent - if Downfall lacked a proper actor for Hitler, it could almost slip into farce (and not the classic kind found in Chaplin or the Three Stooges). Bruno Ganz does what I see only on occasion in based-on-life dramas: he goes so deep into character that one figures that no one else could have been this person in this film. Much like with his followers, when he is in the room in a scene, the attention is all on him, as if he was that most wretched of school-teachers who gained attention through the reptilian parts of your brain. Ganz is never over-doing it when the Fuhrer flips out, and he never makes him seem too unbelievable. In other words every look that gets accentuated in a close-up or in the darkness of a room adds to the tension and horror of the whole situation.When one sees the film upon a first viewing, the story of the Goebbles is likely the most disturbing for any viewer. While Mr. and Mrs. Goebbles' fates are well-documented along with the other monsters, their children's fates make for scenes that bring full circle the insanity of Hitler's own messages- the collapse of compassion, the facade of loyalty and honor, the un-stoppable hatred of Jews and anyone not of 'their' creed, all wrapped together in the climax of the picture.I really was not sure what to expect from a film like this. I wasn't sure if the filmmakers would try and make Hitler seem the least bit sympathetic. They did not. I left the theater with a hatred that possibly spread further, as I take umbrage to his perversion of Nietzsche, and his ironic taste in food (vegetarian dictator, who knew). And one flaw I saw in the film was that even with being open-minded for the aspect of the 'other', from the German's perspective, there were some people and characters presented that I could not find acceptable under the writing and direction (in other words, in a few bits, the stark realism vanished). If there is anything worthy to find in the film though is it's brutally honest about the nature of fascism, and the outcome of the effects it has on a war machine like the one that unfolded with WW2. History may or may not be fogged as to what precisely happened in that bunker, but in a dramatic style not too far of a stretch from Rossellini's own Germany Year-Zero, it's definitely worth a viewing (that is, in the right frame of mind).",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

This is the most boring film of all time!A moment-by-moment description of how things went pear-shaped for the 3rd Reich - from the novelty perspective of Hitler's bunker!What a hoot. Anyone who has read anything about WW2 will find nothing new here. Hitler was cheesed off cos the war wasn't going too well - Verdammt! - Russians everywhere! Time for all true Nazis to commit suicide, and swear eternal allegiance to the Fuhrer, etc, etc. Most of the dialog is copied from Ian Kershaw's second volume on Hitler, ""1936-1945: Nemesis"".The only interesting thing about this movie is the thought that had the Nazis won the war in the last 3 seconds, (and I were now living in a National Socialist state,) someone might have, by now, been granted permission to make an ""honest"" portrayal of Adolf's last moments on earth - and voilà! This would be that film!",1.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Astounding,"What an amazing film. I'm at a loss for words.First of all, this project which took two years of director Oliver Hirschbiegel's life was an incredibly brave thing to tackle, seeing as there hasn't been a film chronicling Hitlers last days for 30+ years.The attention to detail is there to see as well and as far as I can tell, is factually as accurate as it possibly can be. There is debate as to some of the possible events such as how exactly Hitler's body was disposed but it also seems in order Chronologically. On top of that it also feels very frank and honest and without compromise. Bruno Ganz is simply awesome as Hitler. His detailed research and analysis of Hitler and his mannerisms pays off spectacularly. It really feels like it could be him, and to pull that off in a much copied and more importantly, parodied figure is truly genius. Some of the scenes such as his various rants at his officers and generals, where Speer tells him of his betrayals had me in awe of this mans performance.There were some incredibly shocking scenes also like where the German officer kills his family for not being able to leave Berlin.Akin to 'The Pianist' this is simple, but honest film-making at it's best, which demands the utmost from cast and crew in order to succeed, typified by the final scene with the Goebbels children and the Goebbels themselves. I must say, I thought the casting for Goebbels was tremendous.Put simply, this is a film that, like 'All quiet on the Western Front', will be remembered in 100 years time",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Fascinating but Cold German Entry into its own History.,"""Downfall"" is a fascinating and compelling look at the mindset of the German people at the end of WWII, inspired mostly by the firsthand account of one of Hitler's secretaries who survived the madness that was his bunker in those last days. Here we have an excellent performance from Bruno Ganz as Adolph Hitler, who shows the man's insanity, inhumanity, and his cunning way with people in his intimate circle that allowed him to seduce those around him and the German population at large. Even as everything was falling apart he still had both men and women falling at his knees begging for his next proclamation and willing to follow any order her decreed. In the end, the crushing defeat of his grand ideals, coupled with his irrational hatred for Jewish people that is actually a projection of his own inner hatred for himself and Germany (""The Germans seal their own fate. I have no sympathy for the so-called civilians,"" he says towards the end of days), lead him into paranoid despair and eventual suicide. Likewise, we get a searing performance from Julian Kohler (a fantastic actress best known for her lead in ""Nowhere in Africa"") as Eva Braun, representing perfectly the German elite seduced by the promises of a Utopian Third Reich, and who are in utter and complete denial of the horrors around them right up to the last minute as everything they fought for comes spiraling down into their own self-made hell.One of the few flaws of the film is that it can't decide at times whether to be a straightforward docu-drama (there are often too many of Hitler's inner circle to keep track of) or a soaring WWII epic (there's some compelling subplots revolving around Hitler's youth movement added for dramatic effect). While it may not reach the sublime artistic ideals of ""The Pianist"" or have the emotional heft of ""Schindler's List"" or ""Saving Private Ryan,"" ""Downfall"" deserves a place next to those films for it's unique perspective, for better or worse, on one of the most influential men of the last hundred years and the defining moments of the 20th century.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
"Persuasive, visceral, shocking, and enlightening. And brilliantly made.","The Downfall (2004)There is no way to find any movie-making fault here. The filming, the acting, the sets (if you can call such amazing scenes merely ""sets""), and editing, and drama, the effects, etc etc are all as good as it gets. There no reason to even list all the great actors, from Bruno Ganz playing Hitler on down. It's so disturbing, convincing, and perfect (as much as movies can be) it'll shake you up, deeply, and properly.Historically I can only assume it is accurate. It fits all the bits and pieces I've read about the last days of the Third Reich well, and it is a fully German effort, which gives it some kind of credence. Note, for a moment, that there are a lot of these redemptive, unapologetic, probing films by contemporary Germans, such as Sophie Scholl, and there are not similar movies made by the Japanese for their role in World War II. The implications of that I'm not sure, but it's worth pointing out at least to give huge thanks to the Germans involved for wanting to be honest, openly.There will be a million ways of treating Hitler the person, including not treating him as a person at all. I think director Oliver Hirschbiegel (and his producers) make an astonishingly good effort to get it ""accurate."" It's not a documentary, and there are short scenes clearly meant to be moving beyond just information (like when Dr. Speer finds the patients in the basement of the hospital, or when the woman and the boy ride their bicycle down a woodsy road through golden sunlight). But why not? I don't think beauty is at fault here. The main narrative personality through the movie (the secretary) has at her core a sense of noticing what is true, and wanting what is right, and in the end she finds beauty by simply surviving.But there is a way to analyze what happens here, but not quickly. There are moments that are gory, but there is no dwelling on violence (many suicides take place and we don't usually witness them directly). That alone makes the movie quite the opposite of Tarantino's version of Hitler's demise, for example, or even how Spielberg might show the blood, judging from Private Ryan. The Downfall makes the facts of Hitler's madness no caricature, but a real, frightening insanity, subtle enough to inspire followers. The willingness and the sometimes stupid sheeplike attitudes of the many officers around him is a huge part of the message here, assuming we can call the basic intention of the movie a drive for reassessing the facts of the times, and the implications about how power can be so wrong, and so persuasive.Bottom line? An amazing movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Fascinating and uncompromising look at the final days,"(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book ""Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!"" Get it at Amazon.)It was agreeable to see Hitler reduced to a bent, defeated, raving madman, and there is no question that Bruno Ganz looked the part. The endearments he gave to the children and to his bunker mates contrasted horrifically with his plan for them and his ""love"" for the German people. In a sense the way the final days are presented in this film reminded me of what the victims of the Nazis suffered, and that was also apropos and agreeable. Still most people do not like to see human suffering even to those who may, by all that is right, have it coming; and so it was essentially a depressing experience to watch this film.Alexandria Maria Lara, who played Hitler's last personal secretary, Traudl Junge, provided the only bright spot in this necessarily grim picture. She is a fine actress, but somehow she seemed too normal, too smart actually to be the sort of worshipful underling that she must have been. Incidentally, it is from the book by the real Traudl Junge, Biz sur letzten Stunde, and from Joachim Fest's Der Untergang that this movie was adapted. The fine screenplay was written by Bernd Eichinger. Junge appears at the beginning of the film from an interview in 2001, a year before her death, to say a few words and at the end where she explains that she is essentially not that naive young person she once was who should have looked further than the fuhrer's face to see what was really going on. But she was with Hitler for three years and knew his philosophy well. Truth is she was so pleased to be his secretary that she turned a deaf ear to the truth that was in front of her.Of course she was hardly the only one. An entire nation was seduced and led down the path to genocide, humiliation, starvation, near-starvation, and ignominious defeat. One thing the film does to help us understand how this could have happened is to show the blind loyalty that even some of the highest ranking officers felt toward Hitler regardless of his bumbling, his stupidity and his blatant disregard for the feelings and lives of anyone who got in his way--his essential immorality. Some say there was something in the German character that accounts for this blind obedience to authority regardless of how corrupted and evil that authority might be. Maybe in a more pluralistic and multicultural society something like this could not happen. There might be something to that, but I doubt it. Too many monsters have grown in too many different soils and in so many different cultures, I am persuaded it could happen anywhere, but perhaps not as easily and as completely as it happened in Germany.It is interesting that Oliver Hirshbiegel, who directed, did not show the Red Army atrocities as they stormed into Berlin. I don't think he wanted to dilute the sense of the moral culpability of the German people.I was also struck by Hitler's obsession with loyalty. This is how all dictators, warlords and, unfortunately, some respected heads of state operate: they demand unquestioned loyalty, and they ruthlessly eliminate anyone they suspect of anything but that unquestioned loyalty while rewarding the loyal. And so in such governments the head of state becomes surrounded by sycophants and toadies who tell him what he wants to hear and who live in fear of their own lives should they somehow be seen as disloyal. Indeed they sneak around trying to undermine others in other to protect themselves. They live in secrecy amid lies, intrigue and murder.The film is long, 155 minutes, the bunker is dreary and most of the characters are sickies of the worse sort. We as an audience are reduced to those who see inside a cave, the floor covered with bat guano crawling with despicable creatures who feed off of one another. The stench is overwhelming. We watch transfixed for a while at the ugly, unsavory spectacle and then we turn away.Can it happen again? Can it happen here? Let's hope not, but that freedom that the right assures us is not free requires more than loyalty. It requires vigilance and a willingness to speak out, the kind of vigilance that can see the danger when the government begins to deal almost exclusively in lies and misinformation, that invades other countries for dubious gain, deals in propaganda and points fingers at perceived enemies and promotes only those loyal to the leader instead of those most qualified.(I said I would write this review without mentioning a certain personage, and I did, but the allusions are probably more than obvious.)

very involving and seemingly authentic,"First of all, I am not commenting on the morality or immorality of the depicted contents. I am commenting on the film as such. And that film was really catching. Hitler was portrayed in an extremely believable way. His private moments revealed the cracks in his confidence, yet, they stressed his stubbornness. All of the used décor seemed original. The military language and acting -even that of the extras- was precisely investigated and seemed believable. At no point, I had the feeling ""oh, this is just dumb dramaturgy"". I could feel the imminent collapse of a once so powerful oppression system. Still, in this apocalypse, the myrmidons lost their countenance only slowly. This film has let me live through all of this. Very well made!",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Deeper than Saving Private Ryan,"I must confess that this movie is quiet an experience. But I'm not sure that we can describe it as a war movie. If we compare it with Saving Private Ryan, we get the difference pretty fast. This film try to be objective and want to get a clean radiography of the German way of thinking. I get really impressed with the German patriotism and I stop for a moment and think about something Steven Spielberg's film didn't show. How must had been for the German people to lost that war, for much people the conflict was everything. That is why I think this film is much better than Saving Private Ryan. Oliver Hirschbiegel is not a conformist and doesn't agree with Spielberg simplicity. Good soldiers, bad soldiers and an evil empire. I ignore if Hirschbiegel's film is historically exact, but I'm happy to see at least something new, with great actor as Bruno Ganz in a film that waste emotion.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Unbelievable Realism. Exceptional Accuracy.,"Exhibiting relentless realism & exceptional accuracy on-screen, Downfall (also known as Der Untergang) recreates the events surrounding the final days of German dictator Adolf Hitler's life in the Führerbunker while also depicting the fall of the Third Reich & Berlin during World War II. The film is bookended by excerpts from the real-life Traudl Junge, Hitler's final secretary, and the plot itself is derived from her accounts.The best thing about Downfall is that it keeps the human characteristics of the Führer intact & boldly defies the conventional portrayal of Hitler in media, which was controversial as expected but in my opinion is a brave, respectable & important attempt. What's even more surprising is that by taking this humane approach, the film is able to evoke sympathy & pity from its viewers for someone considered by many to be the most evil person to have ever lived.Contrary to what one might expect, Downfall neither glorifies Adolf Hitler nor Nazism. In fact, it presents the Führer as a completely degraded, broken down & delusional shell of a human being trying to win an already lost cause. The film also exhibits just how profoundly deep rooted & blind was the faith & loyalty of Hitler's followers in him & his ideals as we see many committing suicide for they couldn't digest the idea of living in a world without National Socialism.With great emphasis on showing the value of a human life, whether evil or not, the direction by Oliver Hierschbiegel is an absolute class. Screenplay is pure gem from start to finish. Production design has done a fabulous job here to perfectly recreate the 1940s atmosphere of war-torn Berlin. Cinematography captures every frame in meticulous detail. Editing makes sure every single scene is relevant to the film. And music often goes unnoticed here but it's an integral part of the film.Coming to the performances, Bruno Ganz delivers one of decade's strongest & most haunting performances as Adolf Hitler and from mannerisms to fits of tirade, he gives us the most convincing & authentic portrayal of Führer in media, so far. Alexandra Maria Lara plays Traudl Junge with fine elegance while the rest of the casting is near-perfect too as each actor highly resembled their real-life characters & played them splendidly well. It's a film with powerful performances & every single one of them has delivered.Extremely well researched, beautifully detailed, brutally accurate, insanely realistic & highly gripping from start to finish, Downfall tries to remove our assumption that only inhuman monsters are capable of doing terrible things & shows that how even the most charming men can manage to seduce a whole lot of into barbarism. A German film about the fall of Berlin that places Adolf Hitler in the central role? This isn't just a landmark moment for cinema but for Germany itself.On an overall scale, Downfall is a profoundly moving motion picture & a significant masterpiece that would easily find its place amongst world cinema's greatest films & is arguably the best to come out from Germany. One of the most flawless works of 21st century in my opinion and a perfectly crafted historical account that needs to be shown in schools & universities around the world, this unique take on the most feared dictator of all time is a must watch for everyone. Extremely recommended.",,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

Truth Stranger Than Drama,"I think that in a thousand years of Western History, there has not been a more dramatic saga than that of the rise and fall of the Third Reich. No screenwriter could come up with a harder hitting tale than the rise of a man like Hitler and his eventual demise. It seems too incredible in an era of constant entertainment that this actually took place, but what makes it even more amazing is the way the whole story ended.The whole history really took place in an astonishingly short time period: Hitler rises up out of epic conflict, spreads his evil message to his villainous followers, people join in his evil plots for their own self interests and lust for power, they spread misery and destruction over the world with their fantastic destructive weapons, and finally they are vanquished and driven by their enemies underground where they die at their own hands, while their country is destroyed around them...No wonder fiction writers have been working on this same basic premise for more than sixty years.This story is not fictitious. This is one of those rare movies where the real events could only have differed only slightly from what is depicted on screen. This is an amazing decision on the filmmaker's part, to unfold the events in a semi-documentary fashion, to avoid dramatic overacting, which is too easy to do in depicting these types of people, and provide an unbiased look at the events of the end of the war.There have been a lot of movies made about Hitler's last days, but I think the reason this one stands out is that it unfolds at such a calm and steady pace. Certainly here is the best depiction of Hitler on-screen. Too human? Maybe, but that makes him all the more disturbing. Viewers might question how far each evil Nazi officer is removed from each one of us, and whether we might have the guts to take a higher path when it comes down to it.I would have liked to have seen a few more battle scenes featuring individual combat, but the movie squeezes a lot of info and characters into its running time, and not a shot is wasted. Among war movies it's most similar to ""The Longest Day"", and like that film it works because it stays away from nationalist sentimentality. Very disturbing, but entertaining and fascinating all at the same time.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Ambivalent?,"I'm not entirely sure about this film. On the one hand, it is undoubtedly a very well-directed and acted work of art, with an interesting and important story to tell; on the other, I felt an ambivalence - whether in the director, the actors, the story itself, I can't yet say - regarding the figures that were being portrayed. While the fallibility of Hitler, Eva Braun and the terrifying Goebbels family is immediately apparent (incidentally, I don't think I've ever seen a better and more frightening description of the dark side of motherhood than in Mrs Goebbels in this film), nevertheless I was left with a question mark: were these people really the savage misanthropes history has shown them to be, or idealists martyred to a cause they believed in, however misled? I think there is a danger in the film here, that it could be misused if it fell into the wrong hands. I was also somehow upset by some of the symbolism: the German 12-year-old who is able to destroy two enemy tanks, the drunk and disorderly Russian invaders. Are there fascist associations to this film? If so, are they consciously or unconsciously present? To what extent can a German director make a film of this sort responsibly? Eichinger certainly does a good job, but can he transcend his national origins?It may be useful, while watching it, to bear this question in mind. Nevertheless, a film worth watching.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
"propaganda for ""good Nazis""","after watching the movie one could have had sympathy for the Nazis (if you would not already hate them). it is ridiculous that this work was giving a nomination for Oscar. what else is to say? one of the Nazis, I think his name was Speer , is shown as a kind of good knight. but it is a historical fact, that this man is disliked by his own son, because he never reflected his time as a Nazi as an error or something. it is proved since over 20 years by now that he had known that 1000 of Jews had to work to death in his arbeitslager - they had to break stones for the Nazi-buildings. there is a scene where Hitler talks about that the Jews are the cause for everything bad in the world, that they are a plague. As he said so, his secretary looks to him (camera has a great view of her facial expression) as if he is crazy, as if she could not believe what he is saying. this is ridiculous: as if she wasn't an antisemit on her own ! but, why this ? the answer is simple: the book for the movie was created under the helping hand from this secretary. it is easy, eh ? Hitler was crazy (at the end (of his Reich)), and there were a lot of bad, but also a lot of good Nazis. and have a look at the end of the film: there is said that so and so millions of humans died in the WW2. and then, a new screen: so and so many Jews died . so: are Jews no humans, or what ? ... you should see the movie, and try to imagine if you would not known anything about this period of mankind: one could really have sympathy: For Adolf Hitler and his Nazis.really, this movie i dislike.",1.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
One of the best performances ever!,"I absolutely love this movie. The audience is thrown into the final days of the war in Europe and is forced to accept a person who history has declared a monster and must realize that he was a human with all of those emotions. The writing, directing, and the acting especially by Bruno Ganz were incredible. Adolf Hitler was a human who not only made the appalling decisions that wiped out millions of people, but he also was a man who cared enough about his secretary to make sure she was out of Berlin to avoid Communist rule with the Soviets. In my opinion, ""Downfall"" is a must see movie for everyone and one of the best movies of all time as well as probably the best acting performance of all time.The story is about the final days of Adolf Hitler in his bunker as the Soviet Army is encircling what is left of the city of Berlin. It is shown through the eyes of one of Hitler's personal secretaries, Traudl Junge, played by Alexandra Maria Lara (TV-Doctor Zhivago,) who is completely loyal to Hitler. Junge is staying loyal even though Hitler's closet allies are abandoning him. Hitler, played masterfully by Bruno Ganz (The Manchurian Candidate,) is almost bi-polar in the final days. One moment, he is the historical monster the audience as grown to know as we watch he tell his generals that there are large German armies outside of Berlin who are going to rescue him, then screaming at them when they don't. Then you see a Hitler that is concerned about his friends and the people who have worked for him, telling people to leave Berlin because the war is lost. I am not aware of another movie that has shown that kind of a Hitler. After Hitler commits suicide, the rest of the story focuses on Joseph Goebbels short command of Germany, the murder or his own children, his death, and Junge's escape out of Berlin. Quite possibly the greatest performance by an actor, Bruno Ganz delivers us an Adolf Hitler that society is not ready to embrace. Ganz acting decisions to show us a human Hitler with emotions of kindness, compassion, and love, is completely different than the Hitler history has showed us. There are two scenes that show the greatness of his performance. The first scene is when Hitler is being told by the his architect, Albert Speer, that he had not obeyed Hitler's orders for quite sometime even though his personal loyalty never wavered. Hitler was furious but all he did was break his pencil, refused to shake his hand, and shed a tear. To show a monster with emotions is a powerful statement, especially the emotion of sadness, not just betrayal. Another scene that was powerful to me was when Junge walked into Hitler's room and he was sitting there with very little light looking at a painting of Otto Von Bismarck. The scene was almost spiritual in that he was sitting there and looking for answers in a calm and still fashion. It is Impossible to imagine the Hitler in history books that was this peaceful, but that is exactly how he was portrayed, at peace. Ganz makes many risks on this character and succeeds on ever one. Not since George C. Scott's portrayal of Patton have I seen an actor become the character he was portraying, Bruno Ganz was Adolf Hitler.Director Oliver Hirschbiegel did not make a wrong choice. While inside the bunker, you felt Closter phobic and never safe from the artillery shells bouncing of the ground, outside you weren't safe and you knew that the longer you stayed outside, the sooner you would become causality. His action scenes were intense, say a step below Saving Private Ryan. Two great scenes that he shot involved the young children defending the city. At the beginning of the film the children were receiving medals from Hitler for their bravery. When the kids were manning an AA gun, a parent came up and told them to leave because they would die, and they would have none of it. They were prepared to die for Hitler. Towards the end of the movie when the defenses were failing one of he children, a young girl, asked another older kid to kill her, and he did. He then turned the gun on himself. This scene was done without words and was again very intense and outstanding. I could go on and on and get into some of the political philosophies of this movie and what they mean but I wont. This is an amazing movie and IF you can handle the fact that by the end of the movie, you may question your beliefs of what Hitler was, a man not a monster, then you should watch this movie, if you can't then stay away. Because this movie gives a convincing argument that not all evil men are heartless monsters, but human beings with a belief that what they are doing is right. *This review and others can be seen at www.bbmc.dockratent.com*",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

How to deal with a monster,"One of the great challenges that an actor can face is in the portrayal of an absolute and uncompromising evil. Such is the challenge faced by many of the actors in Downfall, depicting the final days of the ""Hitler Bunker"" and necessitating portrayals of some of the worst criminals in history, including Heinrich Himmler, Albert Speer, Joseph Goebbels, and of course the arch-devil of National Socialism himself, Adolph Hitler.And that is precisely what separates this movie from any other on the topic, the utterly amazing portrayal of the world's most brutal of dictators by Bruno Ganz. Ganz's performance takes on depths that very few could imagine, let alone portray, in the character of Hitler. His outlandish and sometimes childishly inappropriate reactions to the crumbling of his empire reveal the deep neurosis suffered by Hitler, while other moments in the film reveal sides of Hitler that many do not know of, such as his vegetarianism and love for animals. Another particularly interesting aspect of Ganz's performance is the open but never mentioned portrayal of Hitler as suffering from Parkinson's disease, a widely supported theory on Hitler's physical appearance and mannerisms in the late stages of the war.The deeper issues and consequences of many Nazi practices are only mentioned peripherally in the film, which instead focuses on the personal and psychological effects of the dissolution of the Nazi state on both residents of the bunker and of Berlin above. Some of the film's finest scenes deal with the Volkssturm militias of young boys and old men who were hastily armed and organized as a last ditch defense against the Soviets. In dealing with this a very interesting historical moment is portrayed in the film. The last appearance of Hitler on film before his death was at a small ceremony outside of the entrance to the bunker where he gave medals to several young men that had destroyed a soviet tank, and this moment is shown fantastically in the movie.This film is definitely recommendable to anyone who is interested in the Second World War or even history in general and is sure to stand the test of time as the definitive portrayal of Adolf Hitler.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Hitler was Human; That Makes It All the More Terrifying,"""Downfall"" is a very great psychological study into NOT portraying Adolf Hitler (Bruno Ganz) as some overly caricaturized comic book supervillain or something akin to Darth Vader, but actually showing the clear megalomaniacal and manipulative sociopathic tendencies. Ganz is excellent here, you really feel like you're actually watching Hitler crumble away psychologically as he denies the reality that his regime is coming to an end, slowly losing his grip on reality and lashing out at those who are clearly putting their survival above the craziness. It's great in that it doesn't show him in such a light as to make him sympathetic, but to show what true evil looks like. Not somebody who is brutal 100% of the time, but one who has some major underlying problems and has the wherewithal to put on a friendly face and ""kiss the babies"" when the time comes. A very scary portrait of a figure and also a very poignant and apt for this current political climate in the world today.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
"Enter, After an Hour, Corinna Harfouch as Magda Goebbels","If you haven't noticed, Germany in the early 21st century has been making quality movies focusing introspectively on not-so-pleasant excerpts from that nation's past (Sophie Scholl: The Final Days, about the 1940s anti-Nazi student dissident who was guillotined; The Lives of Others, about the excesses of the Stasi, the East German secret police; and The Baader Meinhof Complex, about the Red Army Faction terrorist group). There also has been at least one film about Germany's more positive history (Luther, about the origins of the Protestant Reformation).In the historical drama Downfall, Alexandra Maria Lara plays Traudl Junge (1920-2002), a real-life secretary to the Fuhrer who is depicted in documentary interview footage as well as by Lara. Like her age peer the martyred Scholl, the youthful Junge hails from Munich. Unlike Scholl, she took a moral wrong turn with the wrong crowd, but in so doing survived, along with others who were there, to give us an account of the last days in the bunker in Berlin.One expects the movie climax to be the suicides of Adolf Hitler and Eva Braun, and the rest beforehand to be mostly a couple of hours of cinematically waiting around. Not so and not so, without giving too much away. Pay special attention, about an hour into the film, when Corinna Harfouch shows up in the role of Magda Goebbels, wife of the Nazi propaganda minister. Harfouch delivers a stunning supporting-actress performance. Also good, in a minor role, is Christian Berkel as an SS physician who has attained more sanity than others around him.In my opinion, Downfall is the best of the recent German historical lot. Education in the psychological and sociological causes of World War II may not be complete without it. Moreover, as a war movie, Downfall in stature is up there with The Bridge on the River Kwai and Saving Private Ryan. From another lens, fascinatingly, albeit disturbingly.",,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Why the build up?,"Great film. I'm not a German, although some of my ancestors were from Hamburg, apparently. It's somewhat ironic that many of the good/evil fairy tales we grew up with emanate from that land-locked, fearful but extraordinary country.What a shocking turn of events to have that man assume power over one of the most sophisticated, innovative and proud people on the globe. What a frickin waste! The Soviet Union would have collapsed in about 1944 except that Hitler breathed life into it by virtue of attacking it. They lost 26 million people in less than 4 years. I cannot get my head around that figure - the Germans themselves lost about 6 million in the war with Russia. How did such senior Generals mess up the assassination plan so badly in 1944? Tough job, I know, but there has to be a backup plan. Still so many questions about all that.Thank God it came to an end. 'Downfall' was an ambitious movie and nailed the target pretty well. I have never understood why the German people followed this Bavarian fool so blindly - the part playing Goebbels didn't convince me. Nor did actress playing his wife. Yet, it happened. I don't think any actor can really portray such utter perversion. Nice try, though.Albert Speer is a fascinating character. I wonder what he did for amusement in his 10 years in Spandau. He was portrayed quite subtlety. I was glad to see that. Hitler loved him like a son and Speer told him the truth at the end, which I think was historically accurate.Horrible, horrible business all round. Europe destroyed itself twice in 30 years - Hitler, Stalin, Churchill and De Gualle should have just gone to Samoa where people swim, fish, play sport, goof around, eat, sleep and relax under a coconut palm for most of the day.That's what I call domination.

A Riveting Portrayal of a Dark Chapter,"Oliver Hirschbiegel's ""Der Untergang"" (Downfall) is a gripping and powerful exploration of the final days of Adolf Hitler's regime during World War II. Released in 2004, this German historical drama is a harrowing and meticulously crafted portrayal of the collapse of the Third Reich, based on the memoirs of Traudl Junge, Hitler's personal secretary.Bruno Ganz delivers an extraordinary performance as Adolf Hitler, capturing the dictator's descent into madness with a chilling authenticity. The film provides a unique perspective by focusing on the experiences of those inside the Führerbunker, including Traudl Junge (played by Alexandra Maria Lara) and other key figures such as Eva Braun (Juliane Köhler) and Joseph Goebbels (Ulrich Matthes).""Der Untergang"" is notable for its unflinching portrayal of the brutality, fanaticism, and delusion that characterized the final days of the Nazi regime. Hirschbiegel's direction is both immersive and unsettling, recreating the claustrophobic atmosphere within the bunker and the chaos that unfolded in the streets of Berlin above.The film's screenplay, written by Bernd Eichinger, skillfully balances historical accuracy with a character-driven narrative. It offers insights into the moral dilemmas faced by those trapped in the inner circle of power as the war reaches its devastating conclusion.The supporting cast delivers exceptional performances, contributing to the film's overall impact. The use of the German language adds authenticity, allowing the characters to express the desperation and disillusionment of their predicament.""Der Untergang"" has been praised for its attention to detail and refusal to glamorize its subjects. It serves as a powerful reminder of the consequences of blind allegiance and the human cost of unchecked authoritarianism.The film's cinematography, by Rainer Klausmann, captures the intensity of the bunker's emotional landscape, and the score, composed by Stephan Zacharias, complements the unfolding tragedy without overshadowing the raw performances.While ""Der Untergang"" is undoubtedly a masterful and haunting work, its intense subject matter may be challenging for some viewers. The film's historical significance and the compelling portrayal of its characters, especially Ganz's portrayal of Hitler, contribute to its lasting impact.In conclusion, ""Der Untergang"" stands as a powerful and unflinching examination of one of the darkest periods in history. With its exceptional performances, meticulous attention to detail, and thought-provoking narrative, it earns a rating of 9, reflecting its excellence as a historical drama that invites reflection and understanding of the complexities surrounding the downfall of the Third Reich.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
A surprisingly sympathetic portrayal of Nazis,"This movie focuses on the human side of the Nazis as if to say, ""they're not all bad."" Hitler, though maniacal, is very brave and is kind and gentle in private. Though he's tough and ruthless with his generals, it's at least in part because they lied to him and because he does not want to admit defeat. Besides he's ruthless with himself, too. No wonder Eva Braun loves him unconditionally. He's really quite ethical, and had dreams of building a better society.His generals are a mixed bag. A couple are monsters, but most are simply fiercely loyal. Some are more concerned with saving civilians in the cities than with waging a last desperate battle. I never knew how compassionate some of the Nazi leaders were. A few stand up to Hitler, and or even ignore his orders in the name of humanity.One comes away from this movie realizing that Hitler and his generals had a great vision and were truly willing to die for their principles. These were courageous people. As far as the Jews, gypsies, and gays who were murdered by the Nazis, there are a couple of lines about the Jews, but other than that, those crimes were clearly not worth mentioning, lest they cloud the human side of Nazi-ism.If you feel the Nazis have been treated unfairly by history, I think you will enjoy this movie. If you are unfamiliar with the atrocities of the Nazis, you will find this movie a truly sympathetic portrait. The only reason I gave it a 6 and not lower is because the acting is very good and the story is well told. Most people (hopefully) will find this movie offensive.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Completely Overrated,"Oh my goodness! What can I say about this film? I had heard so much about this movie, mostly good and positive things, so I wanted to check it out for myself. A WW2 movie from the perspective of Hitler during his last days - intriguing premise and should make a brilliant piece of film right? Boy, was I disappointed; this has got to be one of the most boring films I have ever seen. It's full or clichés, about an hour and a half too long and the pace is incredibly slow - you won't believe how many times I thought to myself: ""just get it over and done with already!"" - even I wanted to kill myself by the halfway mark. But by then I had stopped caring. It does nothing to tell us anything new or refreshing about Hitler's last days, so the whole thing was just completely pointless. Yes, it's supposed to capture just how desperate they all became as the Russians closed in and the leader gradually lost his mind; as if he didn't I suppose the one saving grace of this absolutely terrible movie is Bruno Ganz's portrayal of the Fuhrer; he absolutely nails the great leader down to every little mannerism and nervous tick; you'd think Hitler himself had come back from the dead to be in this movie. But then, not even top-notch acting by Ganz can save this awful movie from its ""downfall"".",1.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Downfall is essential viewing,"Downfall is an amazing film, Bruno Ganz is absolutely amazing as Hitler, and at portraying pure evil in human form. A lot of previous films inaccurately portrayed Hitler as some sort of cartoonish super-villain instead of the charismatic, enticing and well loved leader he was. Hitler came to power through the vote of the common man, not through tyranny, and portraying his appeal is crucial to understanding how evil this vile man really was, he was possible the most evil leader to have ever lived.Bruno Ganz deserves huge amounts of praise for his role, just as Ralph Fiennes does in the equally brilliant 1993 film Schindler's List. Also of note is the lesser known, but no less brilliant, Ulrich Matthes, who plays Joseph Goebbels to an unsettling perfection. Hitler's decline into madness and delusion has never been shown better on film. The cinematography is claustrophobic and whilst it sometimes has an almost tv series type feel, this is never enough to diminish the plot or acting.

Something tells me this movie is probably as accurate as we're ever going to get to the facts about Hitler's last days before ending his life on his terms. I for one do believe the human side of Hitler was someone, no matter how wrong, still believed he was doing the right thing for Germany and it's people. The real tough part was the part of the six children, that was really, really tough to watch. And even then I could see how the parents believed it was the right thing to do.

Strong and intense!!,"I have seen many films about both world wars, some were good and some bad...but Downfall seems to me, in my opinion, the most intense, deepest, and strongest movie about the demise of Hitler and the end of the European theatre.Bruno Ganz portrays Adolf Hitler as if he were Hitler himself. The gestures, mannerisms, even the look would literally give an intense fright to anyone if he walked into a room where no one knew who Ganz was. So much of the story follows the real story of life in the bunker, in and around Berlin, April 1945. The film grips you with clutches of paranoia, fear, and the unknown. It is truly one of those movies that you have to truly appreciate history to understand the complexity of Germany at the final end. It is not an ordinary ""ding dong the Führer's dead"" movie; it's a compelling and to-the-point one you never want to get up and go pee kind.Very sharp, deep, and intense. Definitely a buy and keep for any military or history nostalgia buff.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
"Powerful movie, great cinema","Even knowing the ending did not spoil this magnificent, gripping movie. The performances were out of this world as were the sets and cinematography. It was so tense and moving, emotionally draining at times. How Bruno Ganz failed to win an Oscar for his performance is beyond me. You felt he was Hitler and you really felt you were there in the bunker with them. So claustrophobic. It's hard to feel any sympathy for any of the characters knowing the atrocities they were a part of but the actors made you see that they were human and you felt their fear and pain. A great history lesson as well as great cinema. Highly recommend. A truly great war movie that's all about the drama, chaos and madness rather than action.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
A success in France -- and that is saying a lot.,"The film opened in France this week (6th January), and in a country which has traditionally been very hostile to even the best of post-war German cinema (the recent ""Goodbye Lenin"" was a welcome exception), ""Der Untergang"" has been playing to sold-out houses (I could get a seat only in the first row), which tells you how good it is.A sober and yet chilling account of how, after first laying waste to large swathes of Western and Eastern Europe and murdering its populations, Hitler was absolutely ready to do exactly the same in Germany itself since he judged its people ""unworthy"" of his own deranged ideals.Compelling cinema served by an excellent cast and solid direction.",,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

"Well-made, but annoying","There is no doubt that the actors and the sets are great. But this is all I can say in favor of this movie.The movie does not know what to focus on. There are the scenes in the bunker, which are fine, but get boring with time, and there are the scenes in the streets of Berlin. You get to see the suffering of the civilian population and the ""ordinary soldiers"", but most remain without a face. One who has a face is a military doctor who could have gone but decides to stay in Berlin and help the wounded soldiers. Others are a group of youngsters, some boys and a girl, trying to fight the Soviet tanks.There have been complaints about this movie that it shows Hitler as a human being. I have no problems with that - after all, he was human. I have problems with the rest of the characters. Except Goebbels, who is rather nasty, Goebbels' wife, who is such a fanatic Nazi that she murders her own children so that they don't have to grow up in a world without Nazism, and Eva Braun, who is rather foolish, all the other people in the bunker are very nice and reasonable, trying to convince Hitler to leave Berlin and trying to make him see reason and reality (i.e. the reality that the war could not be won any more.) They try to persuade him to save the civilian population (also called the German people) and the soldiers outside. Hitler refuses to do that, saying the people had not deserved anything better, because it had been too weak.The same holds for the people outside. They are suffering soldiers and civilians, and some heroic men who hold out and try to help the suffering. One of them is the doctor I mentioned above. Yet he is a member of the SS - not of the Wehrmacht. Still he is shown as a good guy who has no flaws. There are two scenes of people being killed as deserters or collaborators, but they last only a few seconds, and these few people who fought against the Third Reich are left without a face and a story.So in spite of the movie's claims just to show what ""really"" happened and not interpret history, it has a message: Hitler (and perhaps Goebbels) were crazy, all the rest were nice people and Hitler's victims.",2.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Disturbing piece of cinema,"Having watched ""Der Untergang"" just yesterday, this movie is pretty far from being out of my mind. And I predict that it will stick with me for a few days more, if not weeks. After the end credits the entire theater just sat there, speechless. I was in awe. I had trouble believing what I just saw, has actually happened once. This movie is no crowd-pleaser. It is devastating to watch and the cruelty in this movie is almost unbearable.When Goebbels' wife killed her 6 children I was crying my eyes out - it was like someone had ripped my heart out and was stomping on it. I wanted to jump up and shout: ""STOP, you stupid, stupid, retarded B*TCH!!!!"". That scene is the single most heartbreaking scene, I have ever seen. And I have seen my share of scenes aspiring to tears.But after all, this movie should be seen by everyone. We need to remember that all the good things about life are not given facts.

His acting was so impressive to me that i finally thought that he was *actually* the Fuhrer, even though i have seen him playing Damiel in Far Away So Close (Wim Wenders, 1993).

A must see WWII film,I've given this film a 10 out of 10 because although it's a long film it kept my full attention right to the end. Seen very much through the eyes of his last secretary this film graphically shows both the physical and emotional horrors of war. It shows how defeat had to be accepted by the die hard Nazis's and the sheer terror of what was happening to them. I thought it was acted superbly throughout.

See and feel this destruction and tragedy,"Der Untergang is a realistic story of the last days of Hitler as seen through the (beautiful) eyes of his favourite secretary Fräulein Traudl Junge. The film shows us the slaughter and murders above the ground, the terrible blasts of the Soviet artillery fire on the governmental district of the capital Berlin. Under the ground life is peaceful and almost normal. The strength of the movie is that it shows us very acceptable, human and normal people around the broken Hitler. The most macabre scenes involve Magda Goebels murdering her beautiful children after she gives them a drink to sleep. The persons act very convincing, speak German as they did and also had the faces of Germans so typical for that period in history.The only thing I missed was some more realistic pictures of Berlin as it was in those last days. Only (a model of) the heavily damaged chancellary and the Voss-strasse is shown and one big office building was used which is acceptable as a building which could have been located in Berlin, but other buildings or streets were NOT typical for builtup and ravaged Berlin. The Tiger I tank was a model used in Private Ryan. In reality there were a couple of the big Königstigers around. The same is true for the Flak gun which was a Soviet 85mm gun, where in reality there were German 88mm Flak guns. At the end the movie follows Traudl Junge and her flight out of Berlin. In the last scene she is a very old (but still beautiful) lady and tells us about her experience more than 55 years ago and how she felt pleased to join Hitler as his secretary and knew nothing of the crimes Hitler committed to the Jews. She was totally innocent and a victim of history. Most people around Hilter have died now, recently also: Traudl Junge and Hitlers personal adjutant: Otto Günsche and strong character Wilhelm Mohnke, which was also present in the battles in Normandy, in the Ardennes and Hungary as a divisional commander of the 1st SS Panzer division. The only one still living today is the man which also left the bunker as the last person to see it: Rochus Misch. The technical operator of the generators of the bunker.Compared to ""The Bunker"" of 1981 this movie is less romantic, less clean and more realistic.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
The Definitive Word on the Subject,"In Oliver Hirschbiegel's ""Downfall"", we follow young secretary Traudi Junge (Alexandra Maria Lara) into Hitler's bunker and witness the final days of the Third Reich through her increasingly disillusioned eyes.Finally, Germany gives us a film on the matter, and, rather unsurprisingly, it feels far more authentic that any other take on the subject. Hirschbiegel's film is taut and claustrophobic and his characters breathe and feel real. His depiction of the war above ground is harrowing and efficient... Yet, as with all such films, ""Der Untergang"" will live or die by its central character: Hitler.Hitler is such a monumental figure that, if you translate him, you are unable to see anything else than the actor portraying him, however talented (Anthony Hopkins and Alec Guiness gave it a go and didn't transcend). For the most part, we have had to accept mediocre caricatures suggesting that Hitler was as seen in his speeches (overly manic/dramatic) 24/7 (most films about Hitler fall prey to this, and ""Hitler, the rise of Evil""'s Robert Carlyle is just another example of getting it completely wrong!). Bruno Ganz's portrayal of Adolf Hitler crashes through these misconceptions and the heavy baggage and makes us distinguish the man from the phenomenon. To our horror, we discover that the man who sparked this wretched out-of-control ideology is also a sometimes touching and amiable father-figure, making us understand how so many people would follow him. Ganz manages to become the man, utterly believable throughout, whether showing kindness to someone, yelling at his cowardly generals, or putting his pet out of its misery (a heart-breaking scene).The film, technically admirable and boasting powerhouse performances, truly marks itself as a triumph in terms of tone and message. ""Der Untergang"" shows quite rightly that it is not the misguided and ultimately tragic man, but the system and its followers, that are monstrous. Ganz's Hitler seethes with anger at what he perceives as a betrayal: the German people have failed him, putting an end to the lie that Hitler was a cunning and deceitful sorcerer who brain-washed Germany. The people deceived themselves, and in the final moments, Magda Goebbles and other underlings prove themselves to be more repugnant and evil than Hitler himself ever could be. Thus, the film attracted naive controversy because many refuse to see Hitler as a human being. They do not realize that doing so dilutes the most important message of Nazi Germany: the people, not just Hitler, made it what it was! This could all too easily happen again...You owe it to yourself to see this incredible film!",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Using films as teaching tools,"With the problems in education, the rise of movies and the decline of book reading, how can we not look to films like these to help illuminate, educate and inspire our youth of today? Films such as Gandhi, Kingdom of Heaven, Passion of the Christ and Paradise Now all are educational, almost completely historically accurate portrayals (with a few dramatic licenses) of very notable moments in human history.This film is one of them.Not only does it give you an uncompromising illumination to the ""other side,"" but it helps to educate us on exactly what we are like as humans. It shows us how we will follow our beliefs to our death beds if we believe in them strong enough. Ideas like National Socialism are powerful and dangerous, but this movie does not portray the idea, but the leaders and the effects of them.Downfall should be shown in history classes worldwide. Life is not black and white, good and evil, right and wrong. It is filled with grays and those grays should be embraced. This film shows us gives us this embrace and without such illuminating pieces, then we are no better then the Nazis and their beliefs of right and wrong. Art and their creators are authors of the culture of our times. Let's continue to do this by asking the tough questions, and respecting the facts.",,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Engaging to Watch and (Perhaps Too) Dramatic,"Second attempt at writing a review of this film, Der Untergang/Downfall, from the year 2004. I clicked on the wrong part of the screen...and so lost my first review in nothingness. Not going to spend too much time on my two cents: I think it's a solid film, and I never lost interest, quite some feat for a lengthier film. My only drawback was I thought the film was trying too hard sometimes to elicit emotion from the viewer. It was like they were going for emotional responses in a rather too obvious way, maybe for the mass audience and maybe for awards at film festivals. There was no need for that.One example was during a scene some soldier puts a gun to his head and then pulls the trigger in a make-shift hospital, just as one of the characters in the film moves past. It was over the top. There were many such moments. As such, it wasn't so subtle. There were nice touches as well, sometimes even a little comical, as bombs dropped and those tasked with burning the bodies cowered swiftly after giving the salutes of the time.What stands out is the acting of Bruno Ganz, as Herr Hitler. Excellent. It also looks like great attention was spent on the atmosphere and setting, and also the battle scenes. There was also a variety of story arcs.I hadn't watched this back in 2004, when it came out. I had seen many memes of that one famous scene before, I'll tell you that. Some are quite funny, maybe not so much if your German is good enough.In all, I don't find the film that memorable. It's actually fairly shallow. If someone 50 years from now watches this, that person might be missing some background information. The film assumes everyone knows enough about the period. Still, very little depth given, and most of it politically correct.It was probably a big production and they usually don't offer anything new in modern times. Yeah, they look good, but that's mostly it. This is still worth it, though, mostly for the acting of Ganz. That will stand the test of time.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
The story of the spiralling destruction of the 3rd Reich superbly told,"Parallel narratives of Hitler's Berlin and Hitler's life being squeezed by the approaching enemy are chillingly told in this well researched portrayal of his last days. Despair, bewilderment, incomprehensible fanaticism, grumbling agreement... the whole gamut of emotions as Hitler's entourage are faced with the inevitable reality of the demise of the 3rd Reich, their dream. Bruno Ganz is stunning as Adolf Hitler, Alexandra Maria Lara seemingly a little too bewildered too much of the time (though it may have been a very accurate portrayal) as his secretary, and Corinna Harfouch and Ulrich Matthes both decidedly scary as the fanatic heads of the Goebbels family. It is probably worthwhile to brush up on the famous names of German WWII before seeing this movie, as the variety of names became a little confusing for this WWII neophyte. Not since Das Boot have I seen a war movie of this intensity. 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
"Effective drama, grave and shocking","Yes, Hitler was an unlikely leader of nations but was not a king nor an emperor but was duly elected into office by a supportive populace. The driving force of his impossible vision was due to two main things not often told or even known....one, his deeply neurotic mother love which gradually transformed itself into his deeply neurotic mother love of his(replacement)mother country and two, the character warping accomplished by this utopian artist's unshakable idealistic vision of the perfect world where all perfect things are forever perfectly in their places, just as in a perfect painting on a canvas created by a ""perfect"" artist such as he. An impossible combination, but always possible to him.The mongrelized and thus, to him, imperfect world around him could never be the glorious Aryan world he wanted it to be, but he could not see that truth until the broken end of his fantasy dream, and the film showed well the harrowing result of that break through his collapse into madness and physical debilitation when the real truth of defeat became no longer avoidable.In the future, all determined Utopia-builders will be forever feared, hated and defeated every time they arise, and this fact is in large part due to Hitler's undeniable but personally unknown contribution to the future of mankind and world history though his defeat. Unfortunately, this very same lesson has been obviously shown to us over and over throughout man's long history, but successive generations from each such event seem to have to relearn, through their own tragic experiences, this cruel lesson, the cost of which is always unspeakable human suffering that could have been essentially avoided if we humans could only better learn this oft-repeated historical lesson. One would think that, for man to endure, this lesson must stick tight to humanity one fine day.Perhaps this defect indicates in part the real potential of human cloning as a future way to hopefully avoid the gross historical mistakes from which we humans cannot now seem to learn in order to co-exist in peace. Cloning scares me greatly, but we have to be open to its unknown possibilities for improving human beings as a species.About the film....the main story of the film was the Russian invasion of Berlin, but it was so drawn-out and inconsistent, as they were near the bunker and then not, near again, and then not, and then again, until they finally were there and triumphed. Obviously it was done this way for greater dramatic effect as it made for a more exiting film, but even small changes in well documented war history annoy me when only done for entertainment's sake, thus more profit. True history demands greater honor than that.Hitler's secretary was an important part of the film and of the true bunker story....but Fraulein Jumps' marriage and name change to Frau Junge was not even mentioned.....a sensitive congrats from Hitler that actually occurred was overlooked in the film, possibly in order to not humanize Hitler too much. In reality, Hitler was very fond of his Bunker ""inmates"" throughout the siege and thanked them often for their contribution to the cause, which proves that even monstrously sick people such as he can sometimes do nice and very human things on the long and uneven road to infamy.Overall, the film was very effective in showing the main downside to the personal impact of infamy, that for some of them the only way to escape the terror of inescapable immense public hatred and humiliation resulting from a fall from grace is through the coward's door of suicide, and many criminals along with Hitler have passed through that inglorious door to eternal silence without ever having to face the incredible damage of their actions.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

60 years ago,"It has been months since Der Untergang first premiered. For one reason or another, I kept postponing it, month after month, country after country. Luck dictated I should see it on May 9th 2005, in Hannover, Germany. The 60th anniversary of the Armistice in Europe. The day we celebrate an united Europe (that same Europe that Robert Schumman kicked-off in the 50s and still works in preventing further wars). To make it clear: I am not German. Yet, for more than a few reasons, the history of the Second World War always touched me in a particular way. Not that it was any different from so many other wars. Except for the numbers. Never did human cruelty climbed to such levels. Never did we realize as then, how easy can society mutate into a monster. This was a highly intense movie to watch. Bruno Ganz will for ever be remembered as the magisterial actor that played Hitler - as Ben Kingsley is remembered for Gandhi. We see him in this film as a madman. There is no other way to describe it. He was insane. An insane man led the world to collapse, brought Humanity to its knees, and did so unquestioned. Der Untergang is full of strong imagery - it shouldn't matter if those in the streets were German or not. The human misery is total. I could not contain my tears in many occasions (not titanic tears, rather those that come from the depth, those that imply something beyond the screen. tears of History). In others, I simply had to close or cover my eyes, so brutal were the scenes. And as we come to an end, I am, as viewer, left with a sense of emptiness.

Possibly the most important film of the year...,"Hirschbiegel wanted to make sure that this film was directed by a German, and done right, so that the story was put forth cautiously and in the proper hands. It was heavily researched, and is based primarily on interviews with the sort of 'narration' character, a secretary to Hitler named Traudl Junge, who was 22 at the time, and was excused after the war, considered one of the 'young and innocent' - the youth who were caught up in the Nazi Machine without being considered 'at fault'. Excerpts of her interview make the perfect bookend to this film, as we enter and exit from the story with some powerful thoughts to process. It's also based somewhat on interviews with Albert Speer at Spandau, and shortly after he was released, and on a book by one of the world's foremost historians/researchers on the subject. It's aura is exhaustingly real, unbelievably intense. Even now, three days later, I'm still somewhat numb. This is definitely not Hollywood melodrama...This film is extremely important, because it forces us to realize that Hitler - along with everyone else surrounding him - was one of our species. It does not pull punches, and certainly doesn't make him sympathetic, doesn't 'humanize' him, and highlights his delusions to make sure there's no mistake about his mindset. But it's a film that forces us to realize that it was a human being who did this - who committed some of the worst crimes humanity has ever witnessed, and that is an eye-opener that some people, I think, need to have. Because if we simply dismiss Hitler as an inhuman monster rather and a human one, then we are trivializing the deaths of tens of millions of people, each of whom died in order for us to learn what human beings are truly capable of. 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

If you like that book you'll like the movie plus you'll be historically prepared for the events depicted in the movie. The performances are dead on, especially the minor characters of the fanatic Nazis. If you spend much time looking at blogs and message boards in today's political climate, it's easy to believe people can be this crazy. Magda Goebbels made me think of Ann Coulter. The vignettes of Nazi Germany's death throes interspersed with the battle in Berlin's ruins are one of the truest pictures of the horror (and heroism) of war since ""Saving Private Ryan."" Some viewers may find some scenes too horrifying, as Frau Goebbels did murder her own children, and there are numerous executions and murder-suicides shown as well. This movie is good history, centered mostly around the experience of a nice-looking, but not very sharp girl who was Hitler's secretary for the latter half of the war. She wasn't corrupted by the experience, which is one of the most interesting aspects. I wonder what the affect of a wide US release of this movie would have been last year.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
The Lunatic and HIs Partners,"I assume that this is a relatively accurate account of the events in the bunker as the Russians occupied Berlin and Hitler met his demise. This is an incredible film. It first shows us the events that are war, not just the soldiers, but the civilian casualties. Also the forces of mindless dedication to a cause and ""honor."" As we watch the unstable Fuhrer and those surrounding him, pledged to destroy the world and take no prisoners (the cause is all; it is not for the weak), it's hard to feel sympathy, yet the collateral damage done by their decisions, wives and innocent children, for example, take this out of the realm of sanity. I know that the Russians committed atrocities too, as did the ""civilized people in the war, but the blindness of the principles to what end, that of an unbalanced creature with virtually no redeeming qualities, is hard to take. And then, of course, most of them took the cowardly way out when their hopes are dashed. Yet we still fight wars and do these things to each other. This is a striking film and everyone should have an opportunity to see it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Fair view of history,"Superb performances all round. The murder of the Goebbels children is one of the most chilling scenes I've witnessed in cinema. Perhaps Bruno Ganz deserves Oscar for his dedicated and multilayer character of the Monster. The other actors are also magnificent. In the scenes where we escape the underground hell  an effective depiction of the Hitler Youth fighting on the streets as the Russians close in; the operation of the SS killing squads; some surreal cigarette breaks in the Chancellory grounds; the heroic actions of an SS hospital doctor working under blanket bombing; and a fanciful coda as a secretary makes her escape through Russian lines by averting her face  do we perceive the director's careful, but not objectionable, awareness of modern German sensibilities. Without doubt - 10 out of 10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
The mass mania and despair of the moment portrayed,"DOWNFALL is an excellent film. There have probably been thousands of films that focus on the Second World War, but almost always the focus on Adolph Hitler is one of demonization of one personality, as opposed to examination of the sickness within mass politics that supported him to begin with. Aside from THE TIN DRUM, I can't think of any other work in recent years that so captures the group mania that hatched the Nazi juggernaut.But in DOWNFALL, we see the last days of the Third Reich as surely they must have been. We see first the frustrations of a medical bureaucrat (Dr. Schenck/Christian Berkel) who is trying to salvage what remains of civil structure in the midst of chaos, a man who is only in the late days of the war, along with his colleagues, realizing his own duplicity in the nuttiness that surrounds him. I'm not sure if this is a historically accurate depiction of Schenck, or if he is a fictional composite, but I believe it is right to put forward the idea that there were those few rare people even among the ranks of the Nazis who understood that if Germany had a chance to reshape itself, it would depend on such energies. Not far behind this are scenes in which we see Himmler (Ulrich Noetlen) discussing with a colleague how power will be divided once Hitler implodes. Heino Ferch is solid as Albert Speer, one of the survivors who is destined to tell the story of the Third Reich from the inside. Bruno Ganz portrayal of Hitler is one in which we see the charismatic descend into lunacy as the appointment with retribution draws near.Effective also in their portrayals are Corrinna Harfouch as Magda Goebbels, Ulrich Matthes as the war propagandist Joseph Goebbels, and Julianne Kohler as Eva Braun. Each of these actors represent the despairing mania that prompted the fascist machine among the down and out professional classes to begin with. Their inability to move outside of the extravagance of upper middle class culture is portrayed here in tight style and good form.But most telling of all are the flashback scenes related by the central character of the story, Hitler's secretary Traudl Junge, here portrayed by Alexandra Maria Lara. The movie begins with her job interview in Hitler's office. Hitler is seen through her eyes as the ""loving uncle"" idealist, who indulges her errors, who has hired her for the position because her background is one he connects with out of his romance for his own student days in Munich. Ganz's Hitler isn't the pop-eyed monster from propaganda films, but resembles more closely the guy who brings milk and cheese to your doorstep. Both characterizations reek of what Hannah Arendt called the ""banality of evil"". It is not necessary to sympathize- but I believe the creators of this project are trying to get their audience to understand how easy it could be for an ""advanced"" civilization to crumble into this kind of homicidal delirium. It is a huge undertaking, and while DOWNFALL is far from as comprehensive a movie as one which attempts such a task needs to be, it is an important effort at this moment. Our own time is one in which the professional classes of the western world teeter between a re-awakening of the democratic impulse, and the authoritarian ambitions and imperial designs of late capital.It may seem ludicrous to some to suggest that the west could actually repeat the experience of fascism, but the prime components for such a movement- lower middle class despair, professional class vanity, national myths, infrastructural decay, are in full throttle in the United States, a country which has always been notoriously inattentive to its own political culture. Sad to say, anything could happen in this world of ""tea parties"" and Obamian new age political cults.Fascism as a movement emerged out of the violent antipathies of the professional classes of Germany, the despair of the German workforce shattered by world war and economic depression, capitalist culture driven by late junker speculation, and religious and cultural mysticism. DOWNFALL works as a film because it shows us these twisted political fervors and what they do to people. Its focus as a work is less on Hitler's personality then it is on the mass pathology- to use Erich Fromm's phrase- that made such a violent dervish possible. That's why the work is devastating.The images of Hitler youth, or early teens out fighting Stalin's armies- which, in one of Stalin's rare moments of being on the correct side of history- were administring the death blows to the Nazi mayhem,the images of Frau Goebbels poisoning her children, these are the essence of fascism, far more so then Hitler's personality. The film focuses on what certain political cultures do to people without becoming a work that is tendentious or ""preachy"". It shows us how it must have been in those last days of the German holocaust. Director Oliver Hirschbiegel has given us a powerful gift. It's not one that's easy to open, but it's a lesson from history that has to be confronted earnestly. DOWNFALL provides us with just such a tool.",,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
My brief review of the film,"Heavy but generally well made, this film has been marketed as being about Adolf Hitler's final days and his downfall; it is actually more about the downfall of the Nazis on the whole, with Bruno Ganz in very much a supporting role as Hitler. It sounds like a very positive thing that the film explores more than just Hitler's own downfall, however in execution, the film appears far too busy. There is a lot going on to be followed, as the film chases many different plot lines, without any real focus. Also, it is a bit too talkative to be followed at times. It feels drawn out despite all that is going on because suspense and tension is to a degree jarred by the jumping between all the different events. As lengthy as it might seem at two and a half hours long, a three-hour duration could have been a bit more appropriate. Either way, the visual side of the film is perfect for the project, with an appropriately washed out colour scheme, realistic sets and camera-work to match. Ganz is also very good as Hitler, slowly but surely maddening, and it is an amazement to watch whenever he is on screen - which in turn makes it a shame that such moments exist in less than half of the film's running time. Overall, this is a film worth watching for its realistic and harrowing depiction of the downfall of the Nazi stronghold in Germany, and for the work by Bruno Ganz. Otherwise though, it is not a film for everyone, with its large amount content squeezed into two and a half hours - but that does not mean that it is not a good film.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Gives the essence of the Fall of Berliin,"This was obviously a difficult subject to tackle, but somehow they were able to give the overall essence of what Hitlers bunker and the surrounding rubble of Berlin was like in 1945. War pictures are not meant to be historical documents, as many would believe. The movie industry will never make historically accurate films. Historically based films should do their best to interpret text, photographs, footage; and then only attempt to paint a coherent picture of what happened. Details are important(i.e. whether a Waffen SS soldier was wearing the correct uniform) but what is more important is that the tone and overall feel of the film captures the moment.Take a look at the jingoistic approach to American WW2 film making. The German soldier is essentially Satan. Which is not true. Each German soldier had motivations; Whether it was love of country, loyalty to the Nazi regime, or a family to protect or the taste of power. That is what we get from this film. Normal people trapped in their own machinations. The movie DAS BOOT for instance does the same thing. It doesn't attempt to bulk the German people into one category. Instead it attempt to show each individually. Downfall is another great German films that only a German could do properly.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Must-watch,"Downfall is yet another brilliant world war II movie out of german hands, that does not try to portray anything in a brighter light as it should be.This movie shows how far away the nazi leaders were from a human state.

We shall never return to a state like this, far away from human nature. A crystal-clear must-watch.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
"Hitler's Last Hours in Excruciating, Desultory Detail","Spending over 2 ½ hours witnessing the last hours of Adolf Hitler's life doesn't sound like an exhilarating time, and director Oliver Hirschbiegel's 2004 German-language film has to be one of the more deflating experiences I've had at the movies recently. But that's not to say there aren't moments of great power and passionate, truthful performances. In fact, it feels like quite a breakthrough to have the story actually done in German as it seems targeted to the German populace versus the rest of us interested only in the historical details from the outside. Regardless, the overall effect is enervating from the intentionally methodical approach the filmmaker takes in chronicling the waning moments of the Third Reich. The focal point obviously is the Führer, and Bruno Ganz is powerfully persuasive in alternating between gentility and irrationality but all the while descending into a palpable dementia. It's a vividly rendered performance, which captures all his seeping paranoia and despicable philosophies. The trick for Hirschbiegel and Ganz is not to humanize him to the point of having the viewer feel compassion for this mass murderer because even sixty years after the end of World War II, he continues to exert a powerful fascination. We are intrigued by the psychological forces that gave rise to German National Socialism and shaped its leader, and they successfully pull off the queasy balance of presenting a man who -- before he commits suicide -- speaks with pride about his annihilation of the Jews in Europe. For Hitler and his immediate supporters, the idea of facing the opposition and accounting for those war crimes was unthinkable.Despite Hitler's dominance in the story, it is mostly viewed from the perspective of his personal secretary Traudl Junge, who was just 22 when the Führer hired her in 1942. For example, the anticipated suicide scene is done behind a closed door as Junge realizes what is happening from the outside. Alexandra Maria Lara portrays Junge with an open naïveté that makes her blind devotion understandable to a great degree, but her character is not interesting enough to hold our interest throughout. Consequently, there is a gallery of characters, Hitler's inner circle, who experiences the end of the war on their own terms. Of course, there is Eva Braun, Hitler's infamous mistress whom he married in the last moments of their lives. As portrayed ebulliently by Juliane Köhler, she is a caretaker for the whole bunker, attempting to get everyone's spirits up with liquor, tabletop dancing and the occasional walk outside for a cigarette. She gradually reveals a more tortured soul worrying about her pregnant sister and confessing her increasing discomfort but remaining steadfast in her devotion to the Führer. But the most fascinating and frightening character is Magda Goebbels, portrayed with a cold veneer of calm by Corinna Harfouch. In certain ways, it's an even gutsier performance than Ganz's. Her real-life character's dedication to the Führer reaches such pathological levels that in the movie's most shocking scene, she forces ampoules of cyanide into the mouths of her sleeping children rather than subject them to the grim prospect of ""a world without National Socialism"".Aside from these elements and the shock-inducing recreation of the bombings, the movie is rather dull visually lacking, for example, the panache that Jean-Pierre Jeunet displays in his recent ""A Very Long Engagement"". Mostly, it has the unimaginative feel of a TV-movie, or given its excessive length, more accurately a miniseries completely driven by dialogue often focused on military tactics and sometimes on the human plight involved. The downbeat tone is relentless, as Hirschbiegel shifts his story between the increasingly desperate military situation above ground in Berlin and the oddly eccentric situation in the bunker underneath it. Perhaps the film's greatest value is the implicit absolution of the German people in blindly following Hitler. When he refuses to express compassion for the civilians, and declares that the Germans have brought their fate upon themselves, the movie is conveying that ordinary Germans were as much victims of Nazism as anyone else, a point raised and refuted 44 years ago in Stanley Kramer's ""Judgment at Nuremberg"". It's a valid perspective but unfortunately it's buried in an overlong and desultory film.",4.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

"Devastating, necessary, and very brave","A highlight of the Russian art exhibit at the Guggenheim is a propaganda picture of Stalin and other Soviet leaders (some, like Bukharin, about to be purged) smiling and greeting an exemplary worker. It's very large and somehow comic and shocking at the same time. It's very hard to imagine a picture of Hitler and the Nazi elite ever being displayed like that, even 100 years from now. Possibly Stalin and Mao were responsible for more deaths than Hitler, certainly of their own people, and they were no less insane, especially in their final years. Maybe because they died still in power, they've never been dramatized as Hitler has been so many times. The Alec Guiness Last 10 Days of Hitler covered much the same ground as Der Untergang, but Bruno Ganz has outdone any previous portrayals. This film is relentless in making the audience experience life in the bunker and also in the streets of Berlin above. Josef and Magda Goebbels have never been so real and frightening. Eva Braun has never seemed so frantic and pathetic. It took great courage for German filmmakers to approach this subject so honestly. Ironically, while war-torn Warsaw in The Pianist was recreated on a Berlin sound-stage, it appears from the final credits that the Berlin of Der Untergang was shot in St. Petersburg. This is a great antidote to the Russian film Moloch, made at Berchtesgaden, which made the Nazis clowns instead of monsters. Stupid and banal they were, but not funny. Charles Chaplin said that if he had known about the death camps he would have never made The Great Dictator. There is no comic relief, nor any tragic dignity either, in this harrowing and graphic account of the end of an evil tyranny.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

Hitler Made Human,"Adolf Hitler is the villain of villains, the embodiment of all that's evil for several generations of Westerners both educated and not. He is a symbol of everything vile, bigoted, insanely murderous - and yet we mustn't forget that he was also a human being. To put it in rather simple-minded terms, even Adolf Hitler was once a baby, was once innocent. And to have once been innocent means he must have had the potential to be something other than evil - if not good than at least innocuous, at least harmless. Unless you're a believer in pre-destiny, you must acknowledge that even Hitler had a chance to be something other than history's most famous genocidal maniac; even Hitler could've grown up to be a normal middle-class man with a wife and family, a law-abiding nobody. And it's precisely this fact that one must keep in mind while watching Oliver Hirschbiegel's Downfall, a film that seeks to strip away the symbolism, the veneer of myth and get at something of the real Hitler.There are some who might not want the real Hitler - they might prefer the symbol; it's much easier to hate a symbol than a man - and frankly it's hard to blame them. Who really wants to understand a man so twisted, so driven by insane ideology, by unyielding will? But these are the things that make Hitler interesting, that make Hirschbiegel's take on him compelling. Hirschbiegel gives us a Hitler who is simply unwilling to accept anyone's notion of reality but his own. His advisors tell him the war is going badly but he refuses to believe it; he insists his doomed generals will pull their armies together and push the Russians out of Berlin (the film begins with the city about to fall). When someone tells him news he doesn't like he gets insanely angry, clenching his fists and throwing tantrums like a baby. Does Hirschbiegel mean to suggest that Hitler was some kind of overgrown child, an extreme case of arrested development? He certainly makes a case for Hitler being prone to infantilism; the tantrums reach a level of ferocity that is frightening and absurd, a grown man's version of beating your head against the floor. Some may find this a tad irreverent, portraying Hitler as a childish drama-queen, and yet this is exactly how the character comes across, and on the terms Hirschbiegel sets it is entirely appropriate. This is no in-depth psychoanalysis - Hirschbiegel knows this approach would yield only tedium. Rather than cracking Hitler open, Hirschbiegel seeks to portray as honestly as possible his outward behavior, the signs, if not the causes, of his psychosis.Hirschbiegel hasn't created a great psychological study or brilliant moral treatise, he has simply taken one of history's most infamous figures and made of him the nucleus of a harrowing drama. And ""drama"" is entirely the word - Downfall is as rivetingly dramatic as any movie you're going to see; it succeeds both as a historical recreation and a more intimate portrayal of human dynamic. A good, hypey line for Downfall's blurb might be, ""It puts you inside Hitler's bunker,"" but in this case the line would be more than hype. The film has a you-are-there urgency that most historical films don't achieve, and not just because the production is so physically convincing, so thoroughly detailed. It's not enough to construct a bunker that's accurate down to the doorknobs - everything depends on how strong the players are, and Downfall is blessed with a marvelous ensemble. Foremost among the actors is, of course, Bruno Ganz, who plays Hitler with a ferocity, a focus that is truly impressive. Ganz enunciates super-clearly, like man who expects to have his every utterance not only understood but remembered for all times; and when he's throwing one of his tantrums he nails that high, hysterical note we're familiar with from films of Hitler's speeches, while injecting the words with an extra shot of impotent fury. Ganz's Hitler is ashen-faced and stooped, a broken man, and when he loses his temper he seems to shrink even more in on himself, becoming lost in his frustration at the world's unwillingness to conform to his view of it. Yet there are other facets to this performance too - Hitler has moments of lucidity, moments where he seems to come out of his psychosis, and Ganz is not afraid to lend these calmer times a note of tenderness. Hitler's relationships with those around him form the heart of the movie, and they're all complex ones. With Eva Braun he is adoring; Juliane Kohler gives Braun a confused, distantly anxious quality that melts into pure (some would say insane) devotion in Hitler's presence. Devotion and anxiety are the two emotions that most come to the fore when people deal with Hitler - his military advisors live in a constant state of terror (they know the war is lost but can't make Hitler see it), yet continue to perform their duties; and in Joseph and Magda Goebbels (ably essayed by Ulrich Matthes and Corinna Harfouch) we're given a portrayal of maniacal loyalty that takes on a frightening, tragic dimension.A less insane loyalty is demonstrated by Hitler's young secretary, Traudl (the lovely Alexandra Maria Lara), from whom one senses a sort of maternalistic concern. One could almost imagine Traudl having strange, nurturing feelings for Hitler, a man she perceives as merely troubled (her naiveté), and by showing us Hitler through the eyes of such an eminently rational, radiantly soulful person - a person who is decidedly unevil - Hirschbiegel drags Hitler down from the Pantheon of villains, restoring him at least temporarily to his former status as a mere human being, and allows us, for a moment, to indulge in the potentially-controversial notion that inside the chest of even the most evil of men must beat a human heart.",,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Accurate but Over-Memed Historical Drama,"Downfall (2004), directed by Oliver Hirschbiegel, provides a gripping and meticulously accurate portrayal of Adolf Hitler's final days in his Berlin bunker during the fall of the Third Reich. The film is anchored by Bruno Ganz's exceptional performance as Hitler, capturing the dictator's physical and psychological decline with haunting precision.One of the film's strongest aspects is its attention to historical detail. The set design, costumes, and overall atmosphere effectively recreate the desperate and chaotic environment of Berlin in 1945. The supporting cast also delivers strong performances, adding depth to the depiction of the various figures in Hitler's inner circle.However, the film's reputation has been somewhat marred by the widespread use of its scenes in internet memes, particularly the famous Hitler Reacts parodies. While these memes have brought the film a different kind of notoriety, they can detract from the gravity and historical significance of the movie itself. It's unfortunate that such a serious and well-crafted film is often associated with humorous internet content, which can overshadow its intended impact.In conclusion, Downfall is a well-made historical drama with a standout performance by Bruno Ganz. Its accuracy and detailed portrayal of a critical moment in history are commendable. However, the pervasive meme culture surrounding it has somewhat diminished its serious tone and reception. I give it a 6/10, acknowledging its strengths while noting the unfortunate effect of its meme-driven notoriety.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
"IN SHORT: A fascinating, shocking, moving film. INCREDIBLE ACTING.","This is a German film about the last few days of the war and Hitler's reign as seen from within the walls of the Fuhrer's bunker. We are given a unique perspective of the desperate last few moments of Germany's dictator as his mental state becomes more unstable and he swings from fantasies of a last minute victory with invisible forces to hopelessness and a vengeful sense of betrayal. We are also given a glimpse of the horror faced by ordinary Berliners as a result of the overwhelming assault of allied forces.Downfall is a very well made film it has some incredible effects and depicts the brutality and destruction of war as well as any war film I have ever seen. The film also avoids limiting it's portrayal of the main events and characters within the story with a well-rounded and realistic visual explanation of the madness of war.What really makes this film something special is the acting. Bruno Ganz's depiction of Adolf Hitler is incredible. Not only is he able to recreate the famous power and zeal, he is also shows us the human side of the leader and his connection with those within his inner circle. This is essential for us to understand why so many followed him through the madness, and also enables us to mark the insanity of his anti-semitic mandate.The rest of the cast support beautifully and the attention to detail with the costumes and sets captures the time perfectly. I was blown away by this film and as long as you don't mind education as much as entertainment you must see this film.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Very good but doesn't impact,Certainly well done as the actor playing Hitler really brought out his personality. For me the interest though was not in watching Hitler as the people around him struggle or accept the mess they are in. Maybe that is why the movie doesn't rise to great for me. The supporting case doesn't rise to a level that really makes one care about them or what is going to happen. This despite the makers attempting and I believe showing what it really was like in Berlin during those 10 days. I suppose knowing how it comes out in the end doesn't help any. Minor crit: I wish the movie had done a better job of identifying the names of the people around him. Himmler and Goering were identifiable but I didn't realize until the end who was playing Keitel and Jodl for example.,7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Dangerous and uninteresting,"I once saw a work by the German graphics artist Klaus Staeck, there's a ""Entnazifizierungsurkunde"" (a formula of de-nacification), filled out for a certain Adolf Hitler, where he's rated as ""Mitlaeufer"" (nominal member) of the Nazi party, signed by Joachim C. Fest.This poster very pointedly summarizes Fest's work on Hitler. It's a real shame that such an inadequate work with such a questionable moral background gets rated this high in the INDB. Just one snippet: The only person of the Nazi elite which really manages to commit an atrocity in the whole film is Goebbels wife! All the other Nazi magnificos are pitiful and broken creatures who have failed in a great endeavor.Sure, maybe I should concentrate more on the capabilities of the actors, the camera work and the quality of the adaption of the book (which are all OK, in part even superb). But I won't. A film on this subject can only be measured by the subject itself, and in this respect it fails.

Spectacular at every aspect ! A must watch masterpiece !,"It's been almost seventy years since the end of Second World War and Nazi German regime . Dozens of flims has been made on WW II but none can match the class of Downfall .The flims is all about last ten days of Nazi Germany and Adolf Hitler . Yes , Hitler , who perhaps is the most hated and evil human ever born . The flim cuts all the nonsense out and directly shows what actually happened as if you are watching a documentry . Downfall takes place almost entirely inside the bunker beneath Berlin where Adolf Hitler and his inner circle spent their final days, and died. It ventures outside only to show the collapse of the Nazi defense of Berlin, the misery of the civilian population and the burning of the bodies of Hitler, Eva Braun, and Joseph and Magda Goebbels. For the rest, it occupies a labyrinth of concrete corridors, harshly lighted, with a constant passage back and forth of aides, servants, guards, family members and Hitler's dog .Based on the book 'Inside Hitler's Bunker' by Joachim Fest and 'Until the Final Hour' by Traudl Junge and Melissa Muller , this flim has shown the horror of Nazi regime as well as the despondency of Hitler. The great thing about this movie is you can actually see a person or persons who have undergone a process of dehumanization and indoctrination that at the time point of the movie is irreversible . Hitler makes it very clear in several occasions that he chose to construct himself as such a person , and in the end nearly deiulisional , unable to separate his fatherland from his own persona , but remaining such a human being where he is not concerned about the matter of his civilians . On the whole you could see masses brainwashed by propaganda , blindly following Hitler even after knowing the possible outcome .The violence and depression of the films goes beyond Dark as the scene comes where Magda Gobbles cooly poisons her own children rather than let them live in a world without Hitler's national socialism .The film begins in eyes of Traudl Junge portrayed by Alexandra Maria Lara , where she has been recruited as Hitler's personal secretary and later (as shown in the clip) how she fells about all that . Bruno Ganz as Adolf Hitler is perhaps the best portrayal of Hitler as well as any historical personal . What a spectacular performence he has given , specially on those scenes where Hitler outbursts in rage and takes it out on his generals . Each and every charecter is played with sheer brilliance by the actors . Ulrich Matthes as Joseph Goebbels , Christian Berkel as Prof. Dr. Schenck are only few to name . Those briliant acting performances keeps the audience attached with the movie for two and half hours .We all know the outcome , we all know how it ended yet the director Oliver Hirschbiegel keeps the pace for each and every second . The fall of thrid recih , the vilonlense and casualties of war is shown perfectly. Without a doubt Downfall , originally titled 'Der Untergang' ,is a brave attempt and successfully carried out by the cast .",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Powerful - this film will stay with you,"How many war films can you name that are told from the perspective of the losing side? Not that many, I would guess...Downfall is a stunning achievement. Covering the final days of Hitler in his bunker at the end of WWII, told mostly from the perspective of his secretary, Downfall manages to tell human stories about the persons who followed Hitler.Let's start with Hitler himself; Bruno Ganz's performance is sublime. Hitler was a monster, and so we tend to forget that he was also just a man. Ganz switches between a polite, caring old man to a brutal monster in an instant. His secretary, Traudl Junge, even comments on this near the end of the film.The people around him vary from the fanatical believer (the Goebbels come across as far more monstrous than Hitler himself) to the pragmatic realist. This is where the real drama is generated; Hitler believes that the Allied and Soviet advances are merely setbacks and a counter-attack will put everything right. But everyone else knows that the Germans have insufficient forces to mount any kind of offensive, and telling Hitler this may itself be a death sentence.It is often said that no-one considers themselves the bad guys. This is on full display here; Hitler and his inner circle, hiding in their bunker, lamenting the death of their dream of a better world.The lessons from history are here to be learned, if the viewer has a mind to learn them. This film's greatest achievement is to show the humanity, the human people, at the centre of this chapter of history. And thus to recognise that, as we are all just human, we could find ourselves in that same situation if we allow history to repeat itself.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

The movie is like reality,"Firstly, I know the film from the VCD rental near my house. I saw at the label of the VCD that this film is the winner of the best foreign language film at Academy Award. I was impressed for the movie because of the face and the acts of the actors really represent the real situation of the Nazi regimes at that time. I love this movie so much. Although, i don't understand German language, i can feel the atmosphere of the war and i wonder how if i live in the bunker like that. Almost all of the actors and the actresses in this movie are the elite German-speaking actors and actresses. They deserved to be the elite actors and actresses in the world. For me, it is a very fantastic film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Inferno,"The deepest impression I had emerging from the cinema after two-and-a-half hours was the vision of an inferno that uncannily reminded me of scenes I saw a month earlier in the same cinema, in Constantine.The next thing that hit my mind was that Downfall is not about Hitler, at least not largely about him. The screen time allocated to this character is not as much as you would expect, and after his death, the movie goes on for another half-hour. It is more about the downfall of Berlin, mainly reflected in events surrounding Hitler and company, about the city's degeneration into the inferno we see.Even for those of us fortunate enough to have been spared WW II, the mere mention of the word ""Hitler"" conjures up images of monstrosities that make the blood boil. It's therefore difficult to view Downfall with a detached and objective frame of mind. But then, this movie does not really show us Hitler as such, but only shows him during the last two weeks of his life. The point I'm trying to make is that this movie does not achieve the effect of showing Hitler in a favorable light, even if there's such an intention, which I doubt. If I can express this graphically, what we see is just one tiny little segment of a circle called ""Hitler"".But even within this very tiny segment we see of Hitler, there are things that firmly point to the Hitler we understand him to be. For example, when told that what he is ordering is to send boys out as young soldiers to die, his reply is ""Isn't that what's they're for?"" And here, he's not talking about Jews, but about people who are going to be the future of Germany. I rest my case.So we see Hitler the mad man maybe a little madder than usual in his last two weeks. We also see different people around him reacting differently. Most chilling are those who look absolutely in control, but whose minds have in reality been totally warped by him. Topping this list are the Goebbels, particularly Madga. Others fall in different positions in a wide spectrum. Outside the underground Bunker where these people are hiding, there is an even greater variety of people reacting differently to the bombardment of Berlin, the devastating destruction of life and city and the menacing approach of the enemy (i.e. the Red Army). All these unfold in front of our eyes in an epic of inferno proportion.We are not spared the graphic atrocity of limbs saw away live by army surgeons, half a head appearing right beside someone coming around after a shell explosion, just two among many scenes that speak even louder than those in Saving Private Ryan. By comparison, blowing a brain out, a common occurrence in Downfall, is banal. Adding to the total experience, with the incredible sound system in the cinema I went to, my chair shook every time there was an artillery shell explosion on the screen.Painstaking attention has been paid to the camera work in this movie. This is quite important in a dramatized documentary of this sort, when there is really no story line for the audience to hook on to. Instead, what I found most stimulating was that almost every frame displays a different construction: varying angles, positioning of objects and characters, panning, still shots, various points of view  endlessly changing so that you're always looking forward to the visual stimulation of the next frame, even when the story may not always sustain the same level of interest.At the end of the movie, we are told what happened to each of the more important characters, from receiving judgement at Nuremberg to vanishing completely and never to be found. This rounds up the movie with a good historical perspective, allowing the audience to leave the cinema a little less stunned and dazed from the harrowing experience they've just had.So is it good? Yes, and ground breaking in some ways. Is it good enough to win the Oscar? No, particularly when there's a movie called Mar adentro in the running.",,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
"Great movie, but wrongly humanises Nazis","Well made and directed movie, but makes significant and unforgivable error of humanizing nazis. I studied WWII history really well and make no mistake the women played an equally evil and dispicable and white supremacy role as the men yet women are shown and sweet innocent angels who didn't know better. I can only hope the makers of this movie had no sympathetic views of the third reich who were responsible for the deaths of 80Million human beings",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Gotterdammerung - a Brilliant & Unflinching Masterpiece,"Der Untergang or 'Downfall' is the very best, most realistic and historically accurate Film I have ever seen on this subject. Researched down to the smallest detail, this is an unflinching look at the last few days of Hitler - and the Third Reich - in the Bunker in Berlin. It is gritty & realistic - there are NO Hollywood niceties here, just a slowly creeping sense of doom and almost disbelief at the irrational and incoherent rantings of a doomed Nazi 'cult'. For that is what 'Nazism' in it's purest form is - more a Religion than a Political movement. What makes this entire experience even more stunning is that it is based on real eyewitness accounts by the people who were there - and survived. Principally through the experience of Traudl Junge, Hitler's Secretary, who witnessed virtually everything in those final few days, we get to experience the 'death' of the Reich as it really was - chaotic, murderous, bloody and INSANE. Bruno Ganz delivers a stunning performance as Hitler - seemingly rational on occasions - tempered by violent outbursts of rage when he feels his orders have not been followed. The German cast are excellent across the board - Kohler's Eva Braun is vivacious and daring, and Harfouch's Magda Goebbels is the epitome of Nazi motherhood - not even wanting her children to survive if Nazism doesn't. Matthes' as Goebbels is almost the devil's spin-doctor and horrifically believable - still crafting empty, useless, speeches as the Soviet guns thunder overhead. His totally uncaring response to SS BF Mohnke's observation that the 'Volkssturm' Units - old men and boys - are being slaughtered is the very essence of Nazi ideology - they NEED to die for the Fuhrer. Time and time again this nihilistic ideology comes through - Hitler dismissing the German people as not worthy of HIM and therefore expendable, Goebbels exclaiming that the Germans gave the Nazis a mandate for what they did (not mentioning of course that they took away any democratic opportunity to get rid of them!) The scenes where Nazi Police hunt the streets for 'deserters' or 'Cowards' - hanging German civilians for the slightest infraction - even while Soviet troops and tanks are yards away - shows the utter insanity of the Nazi position.What REALLY comes across is just how ordinary most of the high ranking Nazi's actually were - only concerned with their status, all trying to evade the Fuhrer's wrath and, even at the end, STILL playing inconsequential political games in their own fantasyland - all this while the ordinary soldiers, civilians and children are fighting on in Berlin.Alexandra Maria Lara plays Junge as a young, idealistic and utterly gullible woman who only slowly realises what she has been serving as the utter madness of the Regime consumes it.The entire film is bookended by clips from an interview with the REAL Traudl Junge, who came to realise that her 'acceptance' of the Nazis was exactly the problem - they grasped power, destroyed any opposition ruthlessly, pursued their own demented ideas with no remorse whatever and, finally, in going down to defeat, determined to take virtually everyone else with them.I would like to say that times have changed, that this simply could not happen again - BUT beware - the enemies of reason and their pursuit of total power have NOT gone away.'Downfall' is more than a Film about the insanity of the 'Third Reich' - it is a warning to us all that this is what happens when people allow dictators to take away our basic freedoms and impose their ideology on a society.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Repetitious History,"This is a documentary-like account of the final days of the Third Reich, with Hitler alternating between delusions of power and acknowledgment of defeat as the Russian Red Army closes in on Berlin. It is very well filmed, but offers no new historical perspective except perhaps to present Hitler as something more than a one-dimensional monster. Its biggest flaw is its sense of repetitiveness. There are countless scenes of Hitler meeting with his generals and discussing flawed tactics. Then the suicide scenes start and these go on forever. Since there is hardly any plot and certainly no suspense, the extreme length of the film becomes tiresome after a while.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Prometheus made me do it,"A friend, knowing how disappointed I was in Prometheus pointed me in the direction of the lampoon review using this movie as a structure. I enjoyed the lampoon tremendously but saw the original DVD on special yesterday, bought it, and watched it last night.I have to say (so long as the subject matter is your cup of tea) this is a quite incredible movie in all respects. The acting, tension, sound and historical accuracy are well beyond anything that has come out of Hollywood in recent times, IMHO.The actor who plays Hitler is so frighteningly real that he seems more real than Hitler himself. Goebbels, Frau Goebbels and the other bunker staff are just brilliant in their authenticity, and in the intensity in which they play their roles.It is not a pleasant or universally appealing movie but quite extraordinary for anyone with an interest in history or the detail of making truly powerful character development, acting and technical production in movies.As for Poopmetheus, the less said the better.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
A Difficult Perspective,"Everyone knows how WWII turned out, unless they don't teach it in schools anymore. A man called Adolf Hitler stepped into the political vacuum left behind after WWI, united the German people behind him and tried to conquer the world. He was one of the most charismatic leaders of the 20th Century and within a decade he had most of western Europe under his control.Unfortunately for Hitler, he chose to take on the might of the USSR and the USA so by 1945 (when the film is set) his ""Thousand Year Empire"" was shrinking down to the hundred or so square miles around Berlin, Germany's capital city.""Der Untergang"" (Downfall) dares to portray Hitler as a human being and has been criticised for doing so. I think that this is unfair because the film does not set out to give us a history lesson. The atrocities committed in Hitler's name are hardly mentioned, but why should they be? Why should every film about WWII have to tell us why it had to be fought?""Der Untergang"" was made by intelligent people and it asks us to be intelligent as we view it. Hitler never saw what his followers did at Belsen. Hitler never saw what his followers did to Russian civilians. Hitler never fought at Stalingrad, Salerno or the Ardennes. During WWII, he never waded in blood. He just gave orders and dreamed of a German empire. ""Der Untergang"" shows him as reality finally intrudes on his fantasies. It also shows some of his most loyal followers trying to deal with the fact that their leader has been revealed as psychologically damaged and physically broken.Bruno Ganz is outstanding as the man who ordered counterattacks by armies that had already been wiped out. If ""Der Untergang"" is guilty of anything, it is guilty of showing us the suffering of the German people as their Fuhrer abandoned them to their fate.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
"Dark, Gritty Film that Focuses on Realism","This film depicts the last days of Nazi Germany when the Soviet army was 15 km from Hitler's bunker Fuhrerbunker. Most WW2 movies focus on the battles from a soldier's perspective, but this is from the perspective of Hitler's secretary, Traudl Junge. She was still alive in 2002 and talked about events surrounding the last days of battle for Berlin before the suicides by Hitler and his mistress (wife then) Eva Braun. Most events are historically accurate based on all accounts, including from Junge's autobiography.The film captured a sense of realism through its dark, gritty atmosphere, direction, acting, and cinematography. To prepare, the actor (Bruno Ganz) playing Hitler studied the literature, accounts, and surviving media surrounding Hitler, including a recording of his normal talking tone away from cameras. Hitler didn't allow such recordings, but Finnish secret agents recorded a private conversation in 1942 for later study. All other recordings were of his public speeches, which is not how he talked or behaved in private. Ganz also studied Parkinson's patients to get an idea of Hitler, who had Parkinson's. Some scenes were cold and brutal to watch but factual, including a scene by Nazi fanatic Magda Goebbels (wife of Nazi propaganda minister Goebbels) murdering her six children over her fear of living in a world without Nazism. Another is a scene of Hitler moving around pieces representing his army divisions on a map. His generals were too scared to tell him the armies were no more. Once a fanatic accepts belief in an ideal or an individual, they cannot exist outside it.The scariest lesson is one can be a monster while completely human, as we saw here. I think it's letting Hitler off the hook to pretend he was some peculiar demon or just a lunatic who had lost control of himself. It's only when you realize Hitler was human and in complete control of his faculties to his final breath that the real horrors begin. The truth is villains are not anything other than human, the worst of humanity. The difference here is power dynamics and Germans enabling his bigotry and hatred by falling prey to his frantic fanaticism. History, time and time again going back to the first civilizations, teaches us Hitler is what you get when you combine the worst of humanity with absolute power. It should make us wary of those seeking absolute power while claiming to be above the laws. Power allows humanity's worst villains to come creeping to the surface. The best AND the worst in humanity lies within humanity itself. There is a constant battle waging within each of us, one between love & hate, joy & misery, peace & fury, courage & fear, and order & chaos. We should always be vigilant to keep ourselves and others from falling prey to the worst in us.Would I recommend this? Yes. The film is in German, but the subtitles are adequate. It's difficult to watch, but I think it's important to understand what fanatical hate and blind devotion to an idea/individual left unchecked can do to people.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

Great war movie,"Greetings from Lithuania.""Der Untergang"" (2004) is in my opinion one of the most memorable WW2 movies ever made. And this is because of 3 but crucial parts, in opinion - great directing and writing and mesmerizing performance by a great Bruno Ganz, who made for me personally the best depiction of Adolf Hitler on any media, in my opinion. As the movie is basically telling a story of the last days of Hitler and those surrounding him in a bunker, it also later moves into streets of Berlin, were Soviet soldiers came.Overall, ""Der Untergang"" is a great war film, made by Germans , telling their story. Movie does not preach, it just shows you a history. Great film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
I have literally never been more disturbed by a movie,"I hate it when people say some movie is scary ""because it could really happen"".I find that aesthetically displeasing. It seems so dull that that is the principle reason something stays with you rather than the artistic decisions it makes.I'm sure this movie is all very clever and well researched but a lot of that was lost on me. It's a pretty impacting depiction of a grandiose individual simply collapsing. I wonder if its legacy is in part people just jacking themselves off to Hitler being unhappy but it's technically very well made.What I want to focus on though is not Hitler but the Goebbles. Now I know basically what happened in that bunker. There were no twists or surprises for me. But the way it's done and the things they said...coupled with how it really happened made it finally pierce the skin and get into a raw nerve.I thought about the Goebbels everyday for a long time after seeing this movie. I couldn't stop.I intentionally seek the most disturbing movies I can find but I can genuinely say this is the only one I come close to regretting even seeing at all.I'm glad I've seen it because now I can move on from it.I've given a rating based on my general enjoyment of the rest of the movie.

"Well made film, but not entirely my cup of tea...","'Downfall' is indeed a very well made film, but I fear the film's appeal might be limited to those interested in history only - specifically Hitler. It was interesting to see a film about the powerful, ruthless Hitler's final moments, where he has lost all hope in winning the war.Hitler is portrayed as an emotional person who even shows regret and compassion, and not the tyrant he was. Yes, he has his outbursts, but one might even feel sorry for him in this film (only if you're not familiar with his history, off course). Although he remained stubborn until the very end, this once powerful dictator - the devil himself - died cowardly by his own hand. May he rot in hell for all eternity!

When Belief Became Madness......,"..Nazi Germany was born and when belief became madness, Berlin fell at the hands of the Allies. In the craze of the Fuehrer's final days, ""Downfall"" lets us see into the souls of men that allowed the madness to rule their compassion, their judgment. As the fate of the German people becomes bleaker and bleaker, as Berlin is invaded by the Russians, the men who cower in their Bunker to lead them into doom refuse to cease the madness of Hitler, instead allowing him to fill the country with false hope while pointing an accusing finger at his Generals and laying the blame of defeat at the German people who so mistakenly followed him into power and mistakenly believed in a cruel false prophet.A story of the final days of the Reich as lived in The Bunker, ""Downfall"" is a film of amazing performances, a gripping drama where the end is clear and historically known, yet still draws you in and takes you to a place so dark, so evil; you wish you could find another ending.Sadly you can't. Innocent children still die at the hands of their mother, Hitler dissolves into a gray, stooped, frenetic, trembling mass of insanity, Eva Braun still dances gaily and smiles through the end of a war that took an awful toll from the heart of humanity.When watching ""Downfall"" you quickly forget you are watching a movie, you forget the people on the screen these are simply actors (amazing, gifted actors), who make magic with a compelling script.If you watch one foreign film this year, make it ""Downfall."" You will walk away baffled, at the lengths blind loyalty will go; at the immense sacrifice one country made to follow an impossible, imperialistic, hateful, hedonistic dream.Yet because of a movie like ""Downfall"" you will learn that not all Germans were Nazi's and some Germans were just people that simply loved their country and the people in it.The lesson of Downfall is...may we never again see a ""Downfall"" as wrenching as this one, for in the film lays a vivid warning for the entire world to see, for the price the German people paid in the end of WWII was very, very steep.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
a precise account of how the madness ruled,"Bruno Ganz is perfect as Hitler! This fact alone would make the movie worth seeing, but there is more than that. It as a precise account of how the madness ruled in the last days of Hitler reign: how he let the country suffer and when he realized that inevitable end, how he said that Germans did deserve the fall. The film showed a lot of futile deaths: ten year old recruits falling in the streets of Berlin fighting against the Russians, deserters shot by Gestapo patrols. It also showed Hitler's power over the people who still obeyed him and many of them also followed his example and committed suicide in the last days. Perhaps the most shocking was Frau Gobbels, who murdered her six children, saying that it was not worth living in a world without Nazism. All in all, the film was shocking and it gave you a strong warning: beware fanatic dictators!",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

I mark this movie highly despite the subject matter not because of it. I believe (personally) the acting to be second to none and rather than feeling sorry for the antagonists, watching them squirm like rats in a tunnel crawling over each other, I take a perverse pleasure in their frantic, brow mopping final machinations to delay the inevitable.

Award-Winning Dramatic Masterpiece,"A powerfully disturbing portrayal of the last days of the 3rd Reich with riveting performances by the entire cast. Be prepared for an intense, rewarding experience on this one. From the brief documentary remarks of Hitler's secretary Traudl Junge at the outset of the film until the hopeful conclusion, this tour de force will give you plenty to think about long after the final credits fade. This is one of the best World War II films ever made.Bruno Ganz gives an award-winning performance. He's chillingly convincing in his finely nuanced portrayal of Hitler during the last years of his demonic life -- from his amazingly patient, grandfatherly treatment of his secretary to his tyrannical rages with his senior military leaders. You won't see many performances better than this.To the credit of the film's director and its casting director, the supporting cast is uniformly strong and gives compelling performances. One of the most noteworthy supporting performances is the sinister portrayal of Frau Goebbels by Corinna Harfouch. Magda Goebbels appears throughout most of the film to be an attentive mother (and political enthusiast) who prides herself at molding her 6 children into model National Socialist wunderkinder. In the film's climactic moments Ms. Harfouch convincingly portrays the pathology of Frau Goebbels' excessive glorification of the Fuhrer and his delusional ideology. Her heinous ""crime"" against nature will shock and outrage many viewers.Not surprisingly, the sound effects and musical score artfully heighten the emotional intensity of the drama and suspense that unfold on screen. After the first few opening scenes of the film, which take place outside of Berlin in November 1942, the setting shifts to the bomb-riddled streets of Berlin. The 5.1 surround sound of the incoming artillery shells accentuates not only the sudden location and time change (to April 1945), but even more ominously it then continues a funereal cadence of pounding artillery explosions during the next 20 or so minutes, signaling the death knell of Hitler's crumbling empire.The musical score also provides an almost haunting backdrop to the malevolence of the Nazi hierarchy, which in the final days of the 3rd Reich cold-bloodedly inflicts a horrific toll on its own German citizens. These effects clearly signal that film director Oliver Hirschbiegel has made a film that is destined to become a classic.Although the Special Features on the DVD release are limited, they are worth watching. The MAKING OF, while running for 50+ minutes, helps to introduce many of the principal characters of this large cast, as well as provide some interesting behind the scenes comments about the film. The INTERVIEW with Melissa Muller, who wrote a book about Hitler's secretary's memoirs is well worth watching.Don't miss this one!",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
good but not great,"Good film, good performances by most of the actors, it is excellent to be a German film and not from another country, with its privileged view of the historical events that occurred in his own country and that were caused by the same.
I think the film could still be better, I think there was something to it, because it is one of the most remarkable events in the history of the twentieth century.
As for the controversy that the film generated, I think it has no reason to be, I think even the film is not very controversial considering its theme, in this aspect I think it could have gone further.
I do not agree with anyone who says that the film ""humanizes"" Hitler. I do not see anything in the film that strikes me as this sense or objective, because in several scenes Hitler refers to his pride in the ""works"" he has performed, among which the extermination of about 6 million Jews.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Don't view it as history,"There were so many historical inaccuracies in this film I had to laugh to myself a few times. You would think at least the Germans could have gotten it right. One of the first glaring inaccuracies was the scene in which Hitler is in the garden of the Chancellery decorating Hitler Youth Boys with the Iron Coss. This event actually happened and was filmed by newsreel cameramen as portrayed in the film. However the even took place in the week before March 22, 1945, and not the day after Hitlers birthday. These are widely regarded as the last films made of Hitler. Strike 1! the HJ boy portrayed receiving the Iron Cross, was not actually from Berlin,and at that time the Russians were no where near Berlin. Strike 2! HJ Leader Artur Axmann was the HJ official at the sight, not some low ranking HJ official. Strike 3! So maybe I was expecting too much, but when I go to see a historic dramatization I at least hope they will stick to the facts. They do not. If you want to see a film based closer to reality see Anthony Hopkins award winning performance in The Bunker. If you know nothing of the truth of this story, hey it's a good little war film. If you are going expecting to see history as we know it come alive, you can forget it.Also the uniforms were among the worst I have ever seen in this kind of dramatization. The Bunker at least used an acknowledged expert, Brian L Davis, as a uniform consultant. These were the cheapest knock offs ever. Furthermore Hopkin's Hitler was far more convincing.",2.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Absolutely stunning. This movie will numb you from head to toe.,"I will keep this reaction brief, as to not try and dig too deep into my mind for words, because, in all honesty, there will never be enough to fully describe how enthralling this film truly is.Telling the story of Hitler's final days, shot almost entirely from the bunker in which he took his last breaths, Downfall is a film that enlightens; it will show you that no matter how cold the blood or how black the heart, human emotion is unavoidable. This, in my opinion, is best seen in the eyes of Bruno Ganz, who does a superb portrayal of the ruthless dictator, when the time draws near to take his own life. As a viewer, you can feel his uncertainty about the situation that he endures; you can sense almost a mild fear in him as the thought crosses his mind. His body language conveys the tremendous amount of stress he under as the doctor sits down with him and gives him advice on the 'best way' to commit suicide. It chills to the bone.However, no scene will pull your heart as if it were tied to a one thousand pound weight than the murder of Ms. Goebbel's children by Goebbel herself. It invokes mass hatred towards both her and her husband, Dr Goebbel, as he could not gather himself to do it, thus forcing the deed on his wife. Either way you tilt the balance, though, the length of the scene and the realism it provokes will haunt you, and it is certainly NOT for the emotionally weak.There are handfuls of scenes, lines, and other small details in this film that make it as fantastic as it is, albeit depressing and bleak. All one needs to do is browse these message boards to learn about them all, but I highly suggest you see for yourself. If you are a war or movie enthusiast, this film should not go unwatched. Just prepare to be shaken.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Impressive,"Epressive and realistic dramatic movie about the World War II ever made. I have never seen a film picturing the insanity of Hitler in his very last days in a bunker in Berlin with his high command, and how the German people were hypnotized by him like in this film. Last year, I saw the deceptive, boring, pretentious and overrated ""Molokh"", showing a caricature of Hitler and Eva Braun in Bavaria. But ""Der Untergang"" is awesome and comparable to ""Apocalypse Now!"", my favorite movie of war.Two years ago, I saw the powerful ""Das Experiment"" and I was impressed with the work of Oliver Hirschbiegel. With ""Der Untergang"", this director is certainly included in my list of favorite directors. It is difficult to highlight one actor or actress in this constellation of stars, but I was impressed with the performance of Bruno Ganz and his ""human"" Hitler, totally different from the stereotypes usual in other movies. The cinematography and the battles are stunning, and the scenario of Berlin completely destroyed recalled the neo-realistic movie of Roberto Rossellini ""Germania Anno Zero"".For those who know Germany and German people, it is amazing to see how this wonderful country survived to the chaos, destruction and lack of command, arrived from the ashes like Phoenix and sixty years later is again one of the greatest nations. For those who might have believed in Hitler and his Nazi Party, it is impressive to see how people is forgotten and treated without compassion by their leader in his last hours. And for those who love war, I really recommend to watch this magnificent anti-war movie, and see the behavior of the leaders and population when a war is lost.

A perfect portrayal of the final peak of Germany's darkest time,"With ""The Downfall"" Oliver Hirschbiegel and Bernd Eichinger created a cinema experience, which had seemed to be too delicate for German movie makers till then; the portrayal of Adolf Hitler and the depiction of the last twelve days of the Third Reich. Historically precise and provided with an enormous amount of artistic intensity, ""The Downfall"" managed to form a cinematic coming to terms with apparently one of the most tragic and in equal terms catastrophic chapters of German history. The more and more appearing senselessness of war and the decaying conception of national socialism are contrasted to the aim of Hitler and his leading elites to continue the war by all means necessary. By the same token the incapability of the principal generals of staff, who are unable to manage, respectively are not willing, to instruct Hitler about the absolutely hopeless situation he maneuvered himself into, is depicted plausibly. In this regard it is essential to point out the acting performed by the main characters resp. the entire cast, for it is the brilliant acting which makes the movie such an intense experience for the audience. Several critics stated that ""The Downfall"" would picture Hitler to human, too much in private moments and that those scenes would distract people from recognizing the delusionally controlled and hate-driven person of Hitler. But it has to be stressed, that just due to the fact it does not conceal Hitlers human and private side but displays it quite obviously, a notion within the audience rises that the evil, the most obnoxious and even the most inhuman ideology might lurk inside of everyone and could possibly find its manifestation. In other words, the danger of such ideology could not be concentrated in this one abstracted evil but in every human at all.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Best Film,"Der Untergang is the best film to have appeared on screens for the last couple of years. No director, producer, actor, writer or even cinematographer has been able to capture and represent on screen something so powerful for a long time. This film exceeds even the highest expectations as it presents a body of work to teach and exhibit rather than to tell the story of the man that was Adolf Hitler.Such subject matter has been tried and tested before with mediocre, stereotyping results that serve to condemn Hitler and his followers. Hitler WAS AN EVIL MAN - BUT WHAT THIS FILM DOES UNLIKE OTHERS, IS SHOW BOTH PARTS OF THAT STATEMENT...YES, HE WAS EVIL, BUT- HE WAS ALSO A MAN. Thus, it gives us the monster and the man - never forgiving him or excusing him. It shows us the disturbing truth of madness grappling society.The film tells us how such atrocities can take place, how his followers were swept up by his charisma and personality (Bruno Ganz as you are probably aware is amazing in this film portraying the fuhrer so well that there is no doubt that he is Hitler), how madness finally outdid itself and how Hitler died.Not for the faint hearted, Der Untergang is as shockingly brutal as it is mind-blowing beautiful. It paints a terrible beauty that was Berlin with haunting visuals of the underground chambers and mesmerising scenes of fire and chaos. It is both a condemnation and celebration of the human psyche and soul. Through great direction and acting we are shown the most low, horrific and dangerous of human capabilities whilst leaving us with an uplifting message of how life can go on.THE DOWNFALL OF THE MOVIE'S TITLE IS NOT SO MUCH REFERRING TO HITLER'S BUT THAT OF ALL HUMANKIND. The message of this film is not concerned with the evils of Hitler but the verge of that evil within ourselves. THE BEST FILM I SAW IN CINEMAS IN 2005.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Amazing,"This movie is amazing in every way possible. The b3st most accurate portrayal of Adolf Hitler I have ever seen.
Absolutely brilliant",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
A worthy and important work,"This is the first German film in 50 years in which Hitler is a central character and almost five million Germans have seen it at the cinema, so it is clearly an important work which represents a honest attempt to face the nation's history in a manner which would be unthinkable from present-day Japan. Of course, this real life version of Gotterdammerung is familiar material to viewers of a certain age or education, but nevertheless the narrative - the last 10 days of the Fuhrer's infamous life - is utterly compelling.The work is an immense achievement for Bernd Eichinger who both wrote and produced it. Although based on two detailed accounts of the claustrophobic life in the bunker - ""Until The Final Hour"" by Hitler's young secretary Traudl Junge (from whose perspective the film is shot) and ""Inside Hitler's Bunker"" by German historian Joachim Fest - Eichinger has clearly done enormous research and has attempted to root all the significant scenes in a documentary source. He was aided by a fine director Oliver Hirschbiegel and a sizeable (for a European work) budget ($16M).Above all though, the film works because of the mesmerizing performance of the Swiss German actor Bruno Ganz as the dictator losing all sense of reality as his dream of a thousand-year Reich is blasted away by Soviet artillery and - as he sees it - the lack of will of the German people. Among a uniformly excellent cast, Ulrich Matthes gives a chilling portrayal as Joseph Goebbels and the scene where Corinna Harfouch as Magda Goebbels murders their six children, because she cannot bear them to live without National Socialism, is the most disturbing in a work that could haunt one for a long time through its violent images.The movie is framed by events involving the secretary Traudl Junge: her job 'interview' in 1942 by a Hitler who seems interested only in that she is from his beloved Munich and an extract from an interview that she recorded just before her death in 2002 when she admits that her youth was no excuse for not thinking about her political seduction. This framing device works well, as does the concluding reminder of the war's toll (six million Jews killed and a total of 60M deaths) and of the post-war experience of the leading characters.Any work about Hitler and especially one by a German production team is bound to attract controversy. The film has been criticised by reviewers for making Hitler too human, but I think that Eichinger has answered this well by insisting: ""If he had been a monster rather than a man, it would take the guilt away from other people"". It has also been challenged by historians for not making clear the Nazi background of Junge and the war crimes of some of the characters who are portrayed more sympathetically than others, but even a work of this scope cannot indulge in so much back-filling.A final danger is that the film might be seen as representing at least elements of the German forces as valiant fighters to the last and the German people themselves as in a sense victims of Hitler's mania, but I feel that a balanced assessment of the work would acquit it of such a charge. My wife and I saw ""Downfall"" with a Jewish couple who are very close friends and who, between them lost four grand-parents in the Holocaust. They too found it a worthy work which is sufficient validation for me.",,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
"Interesting concept, flawed execution","Downfall tells the story of the last days of Hitler (played in the film by Bruno Ganz) in the bunker as Berlin was being attacked by the Russians. Which is an interesting idea for a film, and like most interesting ideas it's also a touchy one. The film follows Hitler and the remaining members of the Third Reich as they try to hold back the Germans, destroy all records of what they were doing, and come to terms with the fact that the Nazi party is over. At the beginning of the film Hitler seems sure that they can still win this, but as time goes on he becomes less and less sure, as the battle moves closer his home. Which makes for a great character study.Downfall, as I said earlier, is an interesting idea for a film. It's nice to see that a film has has the courage to try and tackle such a difficult subject. The film doesn't try to portray the Nazi's as heroes or villains it just try's to show them as people. Which some people might take issue with, but then again if film is going to grow as an art form then we need to push boundaries and make some people uncomfortable in the process. But even though Downfall has a great premise, it struggles with bringing its vision to the screen.Before we get into the issues I'd like to begin with what the film gets right, and if there's one thing Oliver Hirschbiegel, the director of Downfall, gets right, it's casting Bruno Ganz to play Adolf Hitler. He steals every single scene he's in, and this might be a backhanded compliment to Bruno Ganz, but it feels like he was born to play Hitler. I mean his performance in Wings of Desire was great, but this is the one that they'll remember him for, and it's a shame he wasn't nominated for best lead actor. Another thing that Downfall does really well, is that it is able to get you to sympathize with Nazis. At one part in the film I felt legitimate sorrow for some of the characters and then I realized, I was sad because bad things were happening to Nazis. Something I never though I would ever feel in my whole life, and since Downfall made me feel that, I would say it deserves to be commended.But even though Downfall was able to get you to sympathize with Nazis, it still messed some other things up. The biggest problem with Downfall is that it isn't focused. The films main plot is on Hitler in the bunker, all the things he's dealing with, and how he faces his inevitable destruction. And with that center plot, the film tries to build all these different stories and characters that are tied to what's going on with Hitler in the Bunker, and a lot of these are unnecessary and distracting. Another problem I have with all the side characters is a good chunk of the supporting cast is pretty weak. None are terrible but I mean they were unnecessary some were annoying, and I just really didn't care about a whole lot of them. This might seem strange but at some parts Downfall feels like it's trying to imitate Schindler's List. The way in which the horrors of the war are portrayed in Downfall are very similar to way in which the horrors of the holocaust were portrayed in Schindler's List. Maybe it's just me that thinks this, but the way they would have horribly violent actions shot like they were just part of everyday life, felt identical to some parts of Schindler's List. Downfall also has a serious problem with using CGI in some of their battle scenes, it only happens a few times but when it does it ruins the whole scene.Downfall was well received by audiences and critics alike, and was even nominated for best foreign language film by The Academy Awards. And I had have to say that I recommend Downfall, it's worth seeing just based of the concept of the film alone, even if the execution is lackluster.6.6/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
"There is a longer, even better TV version","Probably difficult to get, and only for viewers who speak German, but recently there was a longer version on German TV. It did not add much to the story, but it displayed even more atmospheric scenes, and every scene with Bruno Ganz as Hitler is worth seeing and witnessing the insanity of the events over 60 years ago. In total, the extended TV version adds about 26 minutes to the film, totaling 175 minutes. The German version has English subtitles (I quote the German DVD technical information since I watched it on TV, not DVD). If you can watch, it, it is worth it. It is likely, though, that it will be close to never that it will appear in any other language. I remember the movie Das Boot which hit the screen only in a cut version. Recently, it came out on DVD in German language with English subtitles for the first time. So it may be you need a code free DVD player to be able to watch the Region Code 2 German DVD to get the whole story film.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
A tremendous film,"""The most evil man in history drags everyone down with him..."" That could have been the subtitle to this tremendous film. But that would be letting Adolf Hitler off lightly.Make no mistake - ""Downfall"" is not a film that could get made in Hollywood. They wouldn't get it - they don't have the cultural history that Europe has. They haven't had a single man stand astride the continent and lay waste to it. And not just physically destroy - but morally destroy too. That's what Downfall is about - the utter disintegration and ruination of everything that might be regarded as ""human"".No - only Germans could make this film. Only Germans could truly grasp, portray and confront what Hitler was, and what the Nazis were - and show it to themselves and the world.Downfall is made very much in the German film-making tradition. The story is told through the eyes of Traudl Junge - Hitler's young newly recruited secretary. An incredible, almost unbelievable story, but actually true.The German tradition is seen in the way the story is constructed around ""family"" - in this instance Hitler's entourage. Indeed - Hitler treats his young civilian staff, including Junge as if they are his family - the family he doesn't have. Part of the power of Downfall is its very personal nature. We are close in to the centre of it all - like we are really there.We are confronted with complete madness. Insanity. Mayhem. Wanton and needless death. Stupidity. Madness. But in Downfall we find ourselves as willing observers of it - observing it as if it is somehow ""normal"".We see the pointless appalling destruction of whole families. It's shocking and deeply moving at the same time. Because of the graphic filming it's all hugely impactful.Bruno Ganz is (was) a legend in German-speaking cinema before he came to this role (see also my review here of Wim Wender's Wings of Desire). But this portrayal here of the deranged tyrant Hitler is quite simply magnificent.Sets, filming, script - all are strong with excellent supporting acting.Why not a 10/10 then? Well - Downfall is almost too dense - too powerful - almost beyond the edge of anything. Indeed - Berlin in April 1945 WAS beyond the edge of everything morally, just as all of Germany had been under the years of Nazi rule. Whilst there can be, and should be no redeeming feature - perhaps that's the problem I have. Traudl Junge worked closely with the most evil person in history. It's just beyond the edge of possible to imagine what that was like - even though I have seen it through her eyes.It's still a tremendous film. An amazing cinema experience.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Amazing Movie!!,"This was one of the best movies I have seen recently. I am very interested in anything WWII and I really like movies on the subject as well.

In no way am I a Nazi supporter or anything, but really liked how this movie showed what was going on with Hitler and his army and how he was dealing with WWII. I really liked that this movie did that. The actor who portrays Hitler looks a lot like him in this film, so much so that it's a bit creepy. I highly recommend this movie!!

Outstanding Depiction of Hitler's Last Days,"Downfall has nothing new to actually say about the last days in Berlin after the war. But while I've read many stories about 'Hitler and Eva committing suicide, the fate of Goebbels' children, Hitler's dog being killed etc'; to see these acts in this faithfully recorded story of the last days in the Bunker, brought home just how terrible those days were to its inhabitants. And while you realize that most of the participants helped bring on these events themselves, you can't still feel something towards them as human beings.Now, I'm stopping short (very short) of saying this film made me feel sympathetic towards Hitler or the SS members that were caught in the final days (although I did feel that way towards the civilians); and I'm also stopping short of having any of my original feelings change towards Germany's role in killing millions. But this film was unique in that it was generally low key in its depictions, was realistic, and managed to tell a familiar story in a way unlike any other film I've seen about Hitler – and at the same time not portraying the entire German military and other Nazi supporters as cardboard cutout monsters. Not even Magda Goebbels (Corinna Harfounch) is entirely displayed that way (despite her horrific act, and undying loyalty to Hitler).The acting from all is outstanding – esp the superb performance of Bruno Ganz as Hitler. The whole tone of the film was believable from start to finish. The one negative I could find was that at 155 mins, it might have been a little too long, but I'm not sure what scenes or story lines could have been left out.All in all simply an outstanding film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

A Gritty and Unflinching Look at the Final Days of the Third Reich,"Downfall is an intense and haunting historical drama that offers an unfiltered look at Hitler's final days in the bunker. Bruno Ganz delivers a chilling and mesmerizing performance, fully embodying the role with a terrifying authenticity that makes the film unforgettable. His portrayal of a man consumed by delusion, rage, and paranoia is truly one of the standout aspects of the movie.The film does a great job of immersing the audience in the claustrophobic atmosphere of the Führerbunker, capturing the desperation, fear, and unraveling of those who remained loyal to a collapsing regime. The supporting cast also delivers strong performances, adding depth to the narrative.While Downfall is undeniably well-crafted, its pacing can feel slow at times, and the focus on certain historical figures may not engage all viewers equally. However, it remains a gripping and thought-provoking watch, offering a detailed and humanized-yet unglorified-perspective on one of history's darkest moments.A powerful and well-acted historical drama that is both unsettling and captivating, anchored by Bruno Ganz's phenomenal performance.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

We don't need a lifetime of fiction and non-fiction slating him as a Demon. This realistic account will remain a definitive account of this war cabinet's last moments - if only more filmmakers were able to do this factual justice to important events of human history.

"""They lose me right after the Bunker scene""","The downfall of the otherwise critically-acclaimed DOWNFALL is the complaint that it makes Adolf Hitler look too good, human, sympathetic...Yet Bruno Ganz plays the same fanatically spitting and stammering madman as is always depicted of the most infamous dictator in history... like he studied Hitler's frantic speech delivery and put them into actual conversations...These tantrums occur in-between moments of deep quietness... which are most likely what's mistaken for humanity.... that still speak volumes, like whenever we see him from behind, walking slowly forward, with his hand behind his back, moving around like he has Parkinson's or, worse yet, like Ganz is overacting...Yet it's a nice-looking, deep-green-hued historical melodrama with a cable-movie-vibe, but a good cable movie... and what a rare gift hearing portrayed Nazis speak in their native tongue... being German actors after all, in a German production...And surprisingly, being mostly set in that doomed bunker, it's not too claustrophobic, sporadically cutting outside to see how the real German people (like Elena Dreyden/Yelena Zelenskaya as an insanely beautiful pig-tailed German soldier girl) deal with the oncoming end of the war/defeat of Adolf Hitler...Meanwhile, the film's narrated and based on a fly-on-the-wall account of Hitler's young secretary, who should be one of the main characters but is hardly even semi-peripheral here, losing an otherwise important context of how we're able to witness something that's always been, historically speaking, so tragically enigmatic and frustratingly anticlimactic...Yet the biggest problem with DOWNFALL is it's far too long... a kind of one-note panic stretched-out instead of connected vignettes filling time, to make these nonfictional characters and their cascading end-game more interesting, which is how all epics (from LAWRENCE OF ARABIA to GOODFELLAS) should be.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
So what?,"I left the screening after almost two hours, because I did not realize what this movie wants to tell.

It tells you nothing, except that these people remain true to their principles until death. It tells you nothing about their crimes, it tells you nothing about their powers. It tells you only something about their characters, what nobody needs to know.

There has been a lot of investment into getting good actors and impressive sets. The bunker scenes are shot with low camera angles and in a greenish light. There is not a weak link in this film.Bruno Ganz (actually Swiss) gives the performance of his life as Hitler, and Alexandria Maria Lara (Romanian) plays the role of Traudi Junge as his secretary, on whose book the film was based.Given the lasting impact on world history of this brief period in central Europe, this film should be required viewing for everyone.

"Downfall is a powerful and artistically masterful re-creation of the last days of the Third Reich, a masterpiece in the war genre - My Ultimate Review","Downfall is like no other War-Drama I've ever seen, the attention to detail and authenticity and realism. As the film is set in and around the Führerbunker, director Oliver Hirschbiegel used eyewitness accounts, survivors' memoirs, and other historical sources during production to reconstruct the look and atmosphere of 1940s Berlin. The screenplay was based on the books Inside Hitler's Bunker by historian Joachim Fest and Until the Final Hour by Traudl Junge, one of Hitler's secretaries, among other accounts of the period. Bernd Eichinger who wrote the screenplay and produced the film, to explain his work in one word, extraordinary. According to Eichinger, the film's overlying idea was to make a film about Hitler and wartime Germany that was very close to historical truth, as part of a theme that would allow the German nation to save their own history and ""experience their own trauma"". To accomplish this, the film explores Hitler's decisions and motives during his final days through the perspective of the individuals who lived in the Führerbunker during those times.Bruno Ganz portrays Adolf Hitler and it's completely understandable why his friends advised him not to take the role but I'm glad he did as it turned out to be one of the realest and one of the best performances I've ever seen. He also studied Parkinson's disease patients in a Swiss hospital to prepare for his role as Adolf Hitler. Also helping Bruno Ganz in preparing for the role was the unique, only known recording of Adolf Hitler when he held a private conversation with Field Marshal Gustaf Mannerheim of Finland, eleven minutes of the recording feature relaxed, normal-tone talk in which Hitler generally describe his views about the war. The huge amount of dedication for the role, to make this horrible man, well, to make him human. Something that many will probably find controversial, well the film itself and the portrayal of members of the Third Reich is too easy to find controversial. With the death, the horror, the disgusting deeds that Hitler and the Third Reich did. I'm glad Bernd Eichinger and Oliver Hirschbiegel made them human as this film could easily be seen for historic purposes as I've understood it, it's accurate. In my personal opinion, watching and experiencing a film that shows Hitler as a human being was a nice change. Though he was a monster, he was still a human being like the rest of us and humans have emotions. So I'm glad we got to see Bruno Ganz's interpretation of Adolf Hitler cry and show all of these emotions, emotions that any man would experience in situations like those. There's many characters, real people, that we get to follow through the final days of the Battle of Berlin. With a cast full of known German actors, doing terrific performances.The writing is smart, impressive and truly remarkable. Bernd Eichinger is a talented screenwriter. Oliver Hirschbiegel's direction is superb, with the film being very dialogue and monologue heavy, I have to say he directed those scenes with the utmost skill and perfection. The cinematography and editing is excellent, so is the musical score.Downfall was nominated for Best Foreign Language Film at the 77th Academy Awards and should have won. A history professor and former Luftwaffe helper, Hermann Graml, he praised the film and said that he had not seen a film that was ""so insistent and tormentingly alive"". Graml said that Hitler's portrayal was presented correctly by showing Hitler's will ""to destroy, and his way of denying reality"".It took me a long time to watch this film, mostly because of the length and how I thought it was only set in the bunker and be a boring film. How wrong I was. Though dialogue heavy, Downfall turned out to be a masterpiece in the war genre. With production and art design so incredible. With authentic sets, props and costumes. But I'm actually glad I watched this now and not in my late teens, I think I wouldn't have appreciated it as much then as now.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

"Wonderful movie, should have been done a long time ago","I avoided watching the film because I knew it was really laden with political and ethical significance. Even as a watcher of a film I shunned the responsibility of having to face it, so how could I possibly accuse the people that took part of all of it?The movie, a German two hour and a half marathon of humanity ""falling down"", depicts not only the last delusional day of Herr Hitler, but also that of his closest people, bystanders and young soldiers. It is based on two books, written based on witness accounts of what happened. You need to watch stuff like that in order to understand that even the worse people have been human and had a good side and dreams and connections, but also to understand how the best people get caught in it too, probably because of these same human connections and feelings of loyalty and respect.What I find disgusting is that movies like these only appear a long time after they can do any good. After half a century of Nazi demonizing, when most of the people involved have died, we muster the courage to admit that Hitler was human, too, and that he and his staff were not a bunch of psychopathic evil monsters; they had ties directly to our very nature. Perhaps in a few decades we will get movies depicting terrorists as human, too, and we will wonder on how delusional they were, but still loved their friends and their spouses and their children. A movie that would probably not help anyone still fighting or trying to come to terms with the consequences of terrible acts, because it would be so much time after the fact.What jumps in one's face, again and again, from this movie, is how the cocoon around Hitler, just as with so many other maniacal leaders, left him completely disconnected from reality and from the people around him. We get to understand that the same connections that caught so many people in the tide of Nazism also make a monster from the one that chooses or is forced to sever them. Any possible respect for Hitler vanishes immediately when confronted with the image of a crazy old man, ready to let the entire German nation perish, rather than face his own failure.I would make this film a movie to be watched by children. Not for them to become the subjects of Godwin's law, but to see that human interactions in the inner circle of the Third Reich were no more or less special than the way children relate to each other and their parents. And even if we feel disgust for the people that played strategy games with real people, but were never in the harms way, we have to see those willing to fight for the paternal image of the Fuhrer, the party, God, freedom, or whatever mass delusion they just love to submit to.This film shows - as so many should have, but chose to parody reality for a quick buck - that ""Never again!"" doesn't mean not killing people in concentration camps or drawing swastikas, but not falling in these oh so human and easy to miss traps of character. The little things, the ones that should become apparent before they turn into monstrosity.It also shows how good German actors and cinematography really are. Good job! The only issue I had is with the length of the film. True, it would have been impossible to compress the horror in less time, but some watchers might be ill accustomed to watching something for such a long period of time.

key piece in a jigsaw puzzle,"In February 2002, I happened to be in London and read an article titled ""Hitler's secretary in his final hours dies just days after publishing her memoirs."" (The Independent, Thursday 14 February 2002, page 16) Now, I watched the film and it has given me satisfaction like finding a key piece in a jigsaw puzzle; that important fragment is women, married, unmarried, and mother.Not being particularly a fan of war movies, I had been quite reluctant about viewing this film, but now I believe, within my limited experience, this is the one that women should see or be encouraged to see. Many battle movies may feature females as a kind of symbol of love, peace, and victory, but in reality women do fulfill a big function making a driving force to create and support a great evil, villain, or monster. Japan does have such women as well and what nations in human history don't? Their story are usually untold as they come from good quality valued highly in society.This work projects calm but strong light on a hidden part with unruffled and delicate pictures.

Bunker livin',"Can a film make you feel sorry for actual, literal Hitler?Surprisingly...yeah, kind of. This film achieves pretty much everything it sets out to do - it shows a historically accurate (as far as I know) portrayal of the last few days of Nazi Germany, has amazing performances, and is suitably miserable considering it is showing an entire empire falling, because even if it was an undeniably evil one, some innocents are inevitably caught in the crossfire.Buuuuuuuut...I didn't really care for it personally all that much. This could have been my fault, because I have pretty bad face blindness, and when almost every character in the film is some white guy in military uniform, it makes them pretty damn hard to distinguish from each other for me. Added to this is the issue of them all wanting basically the same thing, so in short, I didn't find the characters all that interesting.And holy hell could this have used some trimming down. I almost wonder if it would have been better if the film never left the bunker at all, because not only would there be considerably less stuff that, in my opinion, didn't really need to be there, you would also have more of an idea of what the characters are feeling.While it is suitably grim, I did also feel as though it was in need of some better direction too...although I'm willing to give that a bit of a pass for now because any film mostly set in one location is going to look pretty boring to me after seeing Inside.But there's a lot this gets right - the performances are all great, especially Bruno Ganz as Hitler. He makes this whole film as far as I'm concerned, being as unhinged as he is depressed, and while some might find it a bit dodgy that to some degree, it does seem to be asking you to sympathise with Hitler, I appreciate how this shows him as he truly was: pretty bloody nuts.So to me, this is one of those films I appreciate more than enjoy, because while it has its moments, I was kind of bored. But I can't deny that is does do exactly what it wants to do, and it's something I'll probably come back to at some point to see if it improves with time.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Haunting,"""Der Untergang"" or ""Downfall"" is certainly not your everyday Nazi movie. the movie begins with the introduction of Traudl Junge, who is chosen from a handful of ladies to be the Fuhrer Adolf Hitler's private secretary. Two years later, the Red Army has fought its way to the outskirts of Berlin and, despite the advice of his followers, Hitler decides to stay in the Fuhrerbunker and supervise Berlin's ""defense"". The movie then follows, through the eyes of Traudl, the last days of one of the most hated men in history. A classic question we ask ourselves whenever we hear or see news of someone doing a despicable deed (terrorists, for example), is ""Are they even human?"" We are often too afraid to know that the answer is ""YES"". To commit such atrocities, you can only be human. This is shown in this movie by its depiction of the Nazi High Command. We see them not as a set of demons ruled by the biggest demon of all but as normal men driven by fate to commit the atrocities. That still does not mean this shows them as ""sympathetic and misunderstood"". If you see this movie, had you hated Hitler for the well documented ""Final Solution"", you might hate him even more for his cowardice and the fact that he let his own people suffer the collapse of his dreams to the bitter end. Bruno Ganz's performance is not praised for nothing. It shows the world's most famous tyrant as a clearly deluded man living on fundamentally incorrect assumptions about human nature, slowly losing track of reality who nevertheless had a larger than life presence about him that people of like mind and impressionable youths took to. We see this dogged loyalty from his followers the most fanatical of whom are almost as deluded as the man himself. Hitler's personal life is also interesting to note. It goes a long way to show that you need not be a socially inept person or show tendencies of animal cruelty to walk the path of a tyrant. By the end of this movie, you might ""pity"" Hitler as one would pity a rabid dog that needs to be put down. Yet you see a differing of opinions even among his inner circle. There are the doggedly loyal ones like Goebbels and his wife but there were others who saw through his delusions and aimed for damage control albeit too late. Overall, this is a must watch for fans of Holocaust movies and, although fairly slow, is one of the most engaging movies I've seen. My rating-9/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
A truly harrowing insight into the last days of the Reich,"Der Untergang is an impressive and brilliant piece of film making and ingenuity. Oliver Hirschbiegel was perfect choice as director, and he and his team have done an absolute fantastic job with the set designs, make up and costumes to make Hitler's inner sanctum and Berlin look and feel as authentic and real as possible. I was thoroughly engrossed from the start to end, and you will be, too. The choice of actors could not have been better. Bruno Ganz as Hitler gives the performance of his life and the supporting cast all do a great job also.I must admit I've never really understood people criticising Der Untergang for humanising Hitler. It was right that the film makers chose to portray Hitler going through all the emotions as described by those who were around him at the time. If you'd prefer see Hitler caricatured as Satan watch Hitler: Rise Of Evil (ok, that was a film portraying Hitler's rise to power rather than his final days alive, but you get my drift). Der Untergang doesn't set out to paint grotesque caricatures of Hitler and his generals as evil monsters. It attempts to bring to life as vividly and accurate as possible what went on without showing bias. Also the plight of the German refugees walking through rubble and children as soldiers hit me profoundly.Adolf Hitler will always continue to arouse interest in people for many years and centuries to come. Der Untergang is the definitive account of his last days alive and a must see for all.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Excellent and Horrifying,"The movie is a thrilling documentary of the last days of one of the worst dictators the world has ever known. When you sit watching the events go by on the screen you forget that it is a movie and not a documentary. The people are real, the horror of the fighting in the streets, the sickening sound of incoming grenades and the Nazi death patrols that without reflection executes old men and boys. Hitler's rage and craziness is real. When we left our seats in the cinema nobody spoke a word for a couple of minutes. It was time for reflection: Can it happen again? This movie is beyond any movie coming out of Hollywood.A 10 it deserves.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
"Excellent movie, it grasped to whole audience from beginning until the end. everybody was silence during and after the movie","What a brilliant movie. It showed just facts, that the Germans were not only bastards, but humans too. It grasped the audience in silence from the beginning until the end of the movie. It was overwhelming. Nodbody spoke or caught during the whole movie! that's unbelievable. It is definitely one of the best movies I have ever seen. It es even better than Das Boot and definitely better than the LOTR (that movie sucked!) Anyway, you MUST have seen this movie at least once, and probably the first time you see this movie, it will grasp you in silence too. How the movie is build up is excellent, how the actors set their characters is amazing, you will believe that it must has happened in this way. A lot of research must have be done to come to this product and all that research paid off. If somebody ever says that he did not liked this movie, he is either not telling the truth or he is British :P Fact is, like mentioned before. It is overwhelming",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
"Important, Provocative, Should be required for every High School Student","Much will be written about the performances and historians will no doubt quibble about minor details. They have nothing better to do. But you should see this movie. Everyone should see this movie.The debate over whether or not it paints Adolf Hitler in too human a light is specious. The problem with high ranking members of the Third Reich, Hitler included, is not that they were inhuman. The problem is that they were quite human, and thus they show us what all human beings, ourselves included, are capable of being when devotion to a twisted ideology is carried to the right-wing extremes of fascism. To dismiss these people as easily recognizable monsters is to absolve ourselves from the duty of watching out for them in our midst.The movie reminds us that Hitler didn't come to power as a result of some coup d'etat, nor did he fall from the sky. His party was elected and legally enacted the laws that led to their rise to power. Little by little the German people sacrificed their freedoms in the name of their ""national security"" and grandiose visions of their imagined global destiny, until the state had so much power, no one could speak up against it for fear of marginalization, imprisonment and, ultimately death. Do you see where I'm going? And silence in the face of growing horrors during time of war was considered patriotic, - then just as it is now.Everything about the movie is first rate, the performances and direction are nothing short of stellar, and one can't help but feel better for having seen it. Pay particularly attention to the epilogues, which include a caveat from Traudl Junge herself, taped shortly before her death last decade. She reminds us that our naivete is no excuse.The price of freedom is eternal vigilance. See this fine movie and never forget.8",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Amazing Movie,"This movie was totally awesome. It was wonderful to see the director make a movie based on real life stories and facts, regardless of worrying about what bad things people might say about the movie. I have heard a lot of controversy about portraying Hitler as a human being. This kind of thinking defeats the purpose of us writing down history and remembering it. If we all decide that Hitler was not a human being, but a devil or demon, or something of that nature, then we will doom ourselves to let another human being rise through the ranks to be a brutal dictator with intentions of world domination and ethnic cleansing. To say that showing Hitler as a human is wrong is to say that sugarcoating history is right.I also found that the humanizing of Hitler has been way over-rated. The movie was not just about Hitler during the last days of the war; it was about the German Government scrambling about Berlin trying to figure out what they were going to do, slowing coming to the realization/acceptance that their worst fears were closing in on them. I really like the fact that the movie was not just suddenly over when Hitler and Eva Braun killed themselves. It went on to show the frantic desperadoes of Berlin fighting to keep the city from surrendering to the Soviets, and also Traudl Junge's escape out of the bunker past the Soviet Soldiers.Great visuals, great acting, and an amazing depiction of Adolf Hitler makes this my favourite movie of 2004. 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
the first time I watched Nazi Germany from a German point of view,"Der Untergang is neither a requiem nor a denial of what Hitler did. For the fist time in my life I watched the Nazi Germany from German point of view. For years Hollywood made the world watch movies like ""Schindler's List"" and ""The Pianist"" to imprint Jewish sufferings on people's mind. Those movies were a perfect means to look at a war by only a means of suffering of race given that only the six million of 50 million demised people were Jewish. The movie perfectly humanizes Hitler and people around him without glorifying and justifying what he and his entourage did. The events mostly are reflected by the perspective of Hitler's secretary Traudl Junge (Lara).Events outside Hitler's bunker are mostly depicted from the perspective of SS doctor Ernst Gunther Schenck (Cristian Berkel). Humanizing a war leader like Hitler helps us to see the historical importance of Nazis' rise to power:how human beings could be blinded by the desire to rule,govern and dominate.The movie at this point is a fine-crafted at which point shows us what happened exactly though it doesn't offer any leads of how and why? If you wanna see some attempt at objectivity, if you wanna see Bruno Ganz's laudable performance as Hitler this movie is a must to see!",,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Powerful portrayal of the end of a world.,"The producers of The Downfall made a number of brilliant editorial decisions. The film explains nothing. It shows in historically accurate detail what happened. The viewer is a witness to the many surreal vignettes played out in the charnal pit of Berlin in final days of WW-II. With this essentially neutral portrayal of a man who alternates between being a kindly uncle and a raving lunatic, the usual cadre of critics who feel they alone own Hitler (it is much more than a cottage industry) are left speechless.Many will find the human Hitler in this film difficult to reconcile with his mythically evil stature. Like Christ, Hitler was a human turned into a god. In Christ's case it was by his supporters; in Hitler's case it was by his enemies. As Christians' have made a sacrificial human a symbol of their religion, so have many Jews incorporated the murderous dictator into a symbol of evil, far more potent than any positive aspect of their religion. But religious ideologues can't have it both ways: If Hitler was not a god, then he was a human and cannot be criticized for being portrayed as one. To complain that the film ""humanizes"" him is an attempt to have one's cake and eat it.To add further complexity, one of the quiet heroes of the film is an SS medical officer. This nuance will clash against the shibboleth that all SS men were only sadistic concentration camp guards instead of also the Swiss Guards of Hitler's megalomaniacal rule. Heavily indoctrinated, they were also the best-trained and fiercest combat troops of WW-II.If there is a criticism that can be made against the film, it is that too many of Hitler's generals were reasonable men, professional soldiers, yet still honor-bound to a madman's captivating aura. Yes, the German General Staff was comprised of classically educated noblemen of a caliber that will never again lead a nation's military. But surely they were not all so resolutely noble, regal and handsome. OK, there were two fatties-Göring and Bormann-but they are clearly as evil as they are corpulent.The supporting women are expertly cast, particularly Eva Braun-more of a party girl than one images (and with a subtle nod to her possible affair with General Fegelein)--as well as Magda Goebbels. Frau Goebbels is an icy beauty, as fascinating as the stare of a cobra. Her methodical poisoning of their six children is one of the most sickening moments in film.Watching this gruesome story unfold is like traveling back to the bunker in a time machine. With stories of the horrors of the Holocaust long since dulled by saturation, it is shocking to witness the catastrophic violence of the death throes of Berlin. Death in the camps was a smoothly humming assembly line; death in Berlin was sudden and always capricious-a deafening cacophony of artillery shells, tank fire, collapsing buildings and the whistle and thud of small arms bullets. Fresh body parts litter this urban moonscape.In the end, The Downfall comes closer than any film or book in portraying convincingly the dissolution of Hitler, the genius psychopath who was able to lead a nation-and himself--down a path of utter destruction. Scenes of officer suicide in the face of Russian advances are realistically portrayed (and evoke echoes of Masada). And yet, still, Hitler's hold on the psyche of a nation is not fully understandable. We see what happened; that his followers thought him truly a god. But how-really-did that happen? Could it happen to us? Extraordinary as the film is in depicting the dying days of a once brilliant madman expiring in his lair like a wounded rabid dog, yet something more is needed to make us understand the ""why"" of it. Perhaps, like all religious conversions, the reason for such a captivating thrall can never be understood. It can only be experienced.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Not too sure about this one,"While there is no doubt that this movie has been very well made, there are certain aspects of which left me feeling very uncomfortable.The movie has been put together very well, the acting is quite excellent, and the storyline is engrossing. The portrayal of Hitler in his last days in the bunker in Berlin is quite gripping and gives some good insights into the way his mental health deteriorated during that period. In particular it shows the paranoia which overtook him as he began to doubt the loyalty of his various German military leaders in carrying out his orders.It also shows that he was quite paranoid about his body being captured by the Soviets and displayed publicly. Accordingly he gave instructions to his staff to ensure that his body was incinerated so that the Soviets could not capture and display his body.While this movie has a lot to recommend it, the thing which made me very uncomfortable was the way in which Hitler was portrayed. It appeared focus quite often during the movie on his humanity towards various people who were it with him in the bunker for example, his personal assistant. These scenes showed Hitler to be a quite caring and sensitive to the those around him, and very concerned about their personal safety. I must admit that this particular image of Hitler was contrary to what I understood about the man.While I understand the movie is quite historical in the way it portrays those final days, I got the feeling that the directors may be a little bit sympathetic towards Hitler which caused me some concern.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Excellent,"This movie is a masterpiece. The acting is superb, and it is as close as possible to the actual events that took place in those last, insane days of the Third Reich. Whoever plays Hitler gives an excellent and noteworthy performance. For once Hitler is actually portrayed as a human being, capable of more than just being a fanatical megalomaniac (as he certainly was). What really strikes you in this movie are two things: a.) The total and absolute destruction of the German state Hitler has led his people into (as evidenced by the ongoing Battle of Berlin, fought by fanatical Hitler Youth and aging conscripts b.) The lunacy of the 3rd Reich, the grotesque, twisted mind of Hitler and the hard to comprehend complete obedience he demanded (and received) from his people.All in all, a very good movie even if your not a history buff. If you are a history buff, let alone into WW II history, not seeing this movie is a mistake that needs to be rectified immediately. It will not disappoint.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Best War Movie I've Ever Seen,"Too many times in American film, or any war film, one side is demonized. It is an important movie for Americans who often like to view themselves as flawless heroes. It is always easy to think of Hitler as a monster or to make a parody him. The difficult part is to realize that he was human as well. Even more so, many of the Nazis had a very human struggle and it can be disturbing to some because their plight draws a remarkable resemblance to our own. Because of this, it raises deeper questions that are usually ignored in this genre. Most war movies are bordering on propaganda, but Downfall isn't. It's the best war movie I can ever remember seeing.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
I have never seen a better film...,"A morbid fascination for the last few days of the Third Reich is the driving force in making this such a gripping film. The actors are astonishingly magnificent and the grit of life in the bunker as Hitlers army collapses around him is so desperately baron that you cannot help but feel truly hollow by the end of the film - which supports its realism.The movie is claustaphobic and at times painful to watch, but it is always fascinating. The subtext and the lines that aren't spoken, instead communicated with a look or expression from the actors make this in my mind an incredibly brave film, a well shot and scripted film and a must see for any film enthusiast. It is quite simply, the best film I have ever seen.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Portrait of the tyrant as an old man,"Paul Auster once wrote a book, 'The Country of Last Things', about a society where nothing new is ever created, and the people subsist on only an-ever reducing collection of recycled goods. This parable of life without hope has been interpreted by many as an allusion to the concentration camps, but it also serves ably as a stylistic description of Berlin in the last days of the war, as depicted in Oliver Hirschbiegel's superb film 'Downfall'. At the centre of the film is a brilliant performance from Bruno Ganz as Hitler, someone who had stripped himself of decency and who here is robbed by defeat first of his charisma, and then of his power, leaving only a vapour of malice and madness clinging to the shell of a man. There are also some interesting portraits of other members of the Nazi inner circle: Speer, dignified but unashamed; Himmler, rational and charmless; and the inhumanly zealous family Goebbels. We also see the life of Hitler's secretaries, who had chosen not to see the truth until it was too late but to do otherwise; one of them (in real life) gives an interview that tops and tails the film. Perhaps the most sympathetic portrayal is that of Eva Braun; her sang-froid, and love of Hitler, are utterly mad but retain some connection with what might be considered admirable qualities in another context.I recently watched Roman Polanski's 'The Pianist', the best film I have seen about the holocaust, and there is of course a kind of black karma in the way that the Nazi's own fate in ruined Berlin mirrors that of the Jewish heroes of that film, struggling to survive in ruined Warsaw. But the differences are also telling, not just in the way that the Nazis brought their end on themselves, but also in the way that their behaviour, right until the death, has become so utterly divorced from any normal human responses; whereas Polanski's pianist is virtually reduced to his animal essence, the Nazis' twisted idealism seems positively unnatural, yet still believable. Horror films where dozens die at the hands of madmen in confined spaces are ten-a-penny (Hirschbiegel himself has made one, 'The Experiment'); yet this story really happened, and was but a sly coda to the overall war. The awfulness of Hitler's life and actions is perhaps too great for us to truly contemplate; yet in this harrowing picture of his final pathos, Hirshbielgel has made a compelling movie about what happens to humans who forget that they are men.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Best biopic ever....,"I read Sir Ian Kershaw's definitive biography of Adolf Hitler little over a year ago. I had studied that era before, but that book really gave me a pretty thorough insight into this monster. This man who was after all made of flesh and blood and was for over a decade almost a father figure and a person to be revered by the German people - among the most literate of Europe at that time. I hated Hitler even more after reading this well-researched biography because I understood how intelligent he was, how great an orator; a person with an aura yet so bloody-minded and bigoted.The Downfall is uncanny because the image that I retained of Hitler after reading his biography is exactly the portrait presented in the film. I can understand how disturbing this film would be for people born and bred on one-dimensional caricatures. The Downfall shows the real Hitler - charmer, lover of dogs and little children, dynamic orator, unrepentant warlord, completely delusional madman. He was all those things and The Downfall is a three-dimensional view of the real man and his last days.The film contains the usual rogues gallery from Hitlers last days: Eva Braun, Goebbels, Speer, Himmler, Keitel, Jodl, Fegelein, Mohnke and the chilling Magda Goebbels. All are portrayed realistically even if some come out looking heroic in their stubbornness. The mechanics of film-making are excellent, and the performances/acting superb.Fegelein comes out looking honorable (which I can understand) and Speer's comes out positively heroic, which I believe to have been one of the great errors of judgment history has made. I refuse to believe he was as innocent as his autobiography portrayed him. Actual conversations Hitler had in the last few days, actual snap decisions, rantings and ravings are all captured realistically in this film. I found almost no fiction in The Downfall and I was already familiar with the very 'realistic' portrayal of events. In fact a lot of ground was covered in the three hour running time in covering a large number of factual incidents. This is an amazing achievement and I would say a history lesson for the open-minded. I would however agree that children, being impressionable, should not see this film because they might come to the wrong conclusions about Hitler.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

Hitler and his Myrmidons may have reaped what they sowed but it's still depressing to see an entire social structure fall apart. And then there is poor dumb Eva Braun, and the half dozen beautiful children of Mister and Mrs. Goebbels, who didnt know the meaning of the word ""war"", poisoned and murderered by their own mother. And that's only to mention the unwitting passing of Hitler's dog Blondi.It's a long story but it had to be. The climax is not Hitler's suicide in the bunker but the harrowing escape of his secretary, Trudl Junge, through the Russian blockade to safety.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Remarkable,"A truly amazing movie, heavy in it's consistence for making the watcher feel the pressuring stress lived at Hitler's Reichtag bunker on the last days of the second world war in Europe. It is without a doubt an historical document for it depict's those days with all the accuracy that history could provide us with today.For some, the movie might look like an apologetic and humanizing view of the Nazis for it shows the all the despair already blending blend in with the blind madness lived by the Germans during this period with the particular plus of a close up of that despair on the ones who worked and lived around Hitler. However, from this point of view this movie is at most a ghost exorcising job from Germans to Germans by engaging dramatically in telling this story they know so well and, for understandable reasons, are hesitant to talk about openly.Very well produced and characterized, with special attention to Ulrich Matthes whose who's character, Joseph Goebbels just isn't any funnier because of the constant thought that he was indeed a real psychopath responsible for the millions of murders caused by the Nazis and Bruno Ganz. The latest engagement in the character of Hitler was something unseen and deeply profound for it is a trip into a mind psychopath that rivals the ones of Anthony Hopkins in Silence of the Lambs.A very good movie!",,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Deutschland Unter Alles,"Frau Traudl Junge, Hitler's secretary, is the focal point of this 2004 German-made Bunker film. She is portrayed by Alexandra Maria Lara. In her comments at the beginning and end of the film, the real Traudl reflects on the forces that led her to be in the position she was and the immorality of Hitler and the Nazi regime. In the movie, the young Traudl has an innocent and despondent demeanor from the time she was chosen as Hitler's secretary in November 1942 until the end, when she and a group of other Bunker persons have fled, seeking to escape the Russians.Director Oliver Hirschbiegel does an amazing job in continually making the viewer feel the sense of siege. What is most striking about ""Untergang"" is its graphic realism. All the scenes of shells dropping bring the viewer there, as if the viewer is experiencing it. In one scene, officers and other Nazis are dancing and making merry in the Old Reich Chancellery (connected to the Bunker by a tunnel) and a wall is blown up by a shell. This is a true story per Traudl's account. The realism of ""Saving Private Ryan"" may have come a few years before, but in urban battle scenes that use darker colors, military green, and grayish shading, Hirschbiegel makes things interesting in his own way, very vivid. Furthermore, he presents a number of scenes involving the wounded awaiting or undergoing medical treatment, including amputations, that are very graphic and gruesome. There was plenty of morphine available, but other medical supplies were scarce.As for the characters, the Germans are divided between fanatical Nazis and those who are reasonable, those who have compassion for people suffering from the physical agonies of war. One of the central figures is Dr. Ernst-Gunter Schenck, played by Christian Berkel. He serves to symbolize the force of reason, as he objects to evacuations of installations and supplies that victimize remaining civilians, seeks morphine and other medical supplies, and questions the meaningless honorable-death mindset of remaining fanatical Nazis. Bur realities are remaining fanatics, wandering terrorized civilians, and the agonizing wounded. The scenes showing the human suffering serve to accentuate the evils of Hitler. He chose to commit suicide to avoid capture by the Russians, so he would not have to experience what everyone else was suffering through. In the meantime, many young German children, which could include females, were serving militarily and being killed or mutilated.Hitler is played by Bruno Ganz. He is the ranter devoid of reason with whom most people are familiar. Ganz is a more wrinkled Hitler than in real life, but he does a good job with the mannerisms, the ravings, and the tremors. He is a totally evil person, as shown in his demand to implement a scorched earth policy even though it would leave German civilians without any necessities. That is on top of his lecture on the savagery of apes, who trample on outsiders; Hitler says humans should learn to be like apes. On this comments board and boards for other Bunker films, it is often noted that the Nazis and others in the Bunker have human feelings and are not totally evil. This observation includes Hitler, who thanks his cooks for things etc. But to me, ""Untergang,"" like other Bunker films, still shows Hitler, Dr. Goebbels, Martin Bormann, and some others as consummately evil, as they should be shown. There are some who seem not to be, military officers or whoever, yet even as they question what Hitler does, they are still loyal. He had a hypnotic effect on people. Even after Hitler refuses Eva Braun (Juliane Kohler) the favor of rescinding his order to execute her brother in law, a favor requested with all trappings of emotion, she says, ""You're the Fuhrer."" Magda Goebbels (Corinna Harfouch) worships Hitler like her husband does and is willing to kill her seven children and herself to avoid a world without him. A well-acted emotional moment, for right or for wrong, is when she holds Hitler and falls to his feet, before he commits suicide. How sad will be life without Hitler.One of the final scenes, after Hitler's suicide, involves Traudl in a group of Bunker escapees deciding what to do next. In combat garb, accompanied by a young boy, she is permitted to pass through the Russian lines with the watching Russian soldiers still. I guess it is silly to compare it to ""The Birds,"" for Traudl is not Tippi Hedren. But as in ""The Birds,"" when ""Untergang"" ends the viewer is left with the sense of having been relieved from a siege in a turbulent epic.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
The Downfall is the movie itself!,"I saw this film in Germany with some German friends when it first released. We all had to hold ourselves back from leaving early from the film. We only decided to stay to see if there was a great ending, but no. The acting was so terrible. I mean just awful and my German friends couldn't agree more. There were random scenes that had nothing to do with the film and they were boring too, which just added to the length of this nightmare. I was surfing through IMDb and came across the ratings and comments for this movie and couldn't believe how highly this film was voted.

Downfall is a high point for cinema,"This is the best foreign film I've ever seen. It's story transcends the language barrier and gives a new depth to the infamous Adolf Hitler. The story is told from his side, for a change, and gradually unveils the incredibly poignant story of his downfall. Everybody knows of the things he's done, so his crimes are hardly mentioned and never dwelled upon. Instead we see Hitler's mental deterioration as the war front grows closer and closer to his bunker. He must face something he's never had to face before: defeat. Bruno Ganz gives one of my favorite male performances of all time as Hitler. Not only does he physically resemble the notorious leader, but he also possesses the same assertiveness and odd mix of anger and fear which brings the character to life. The film is also sandwiched between actual footage from an interview with Traudl Junge (Hitler's personal secretary) which gives the film a firm foundation in reality and an unparalleled emotional core. This film is a masterpiece in every sense.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Superb Anti-War Movie!,"Along with Das Boot, Der Untergang (Downfall) is a gripping, realistic film that speaks against war and the megalomania that can fuel a nation into believing it has moral superiority. Together these two films are the pinnacle of anti-war movies.Bruno Ganz is one of my favorite European actors; his nuanced portrayal of Hitler put me in the bunker along with the remainder of this film's stellar cast.I saw this film late at night when I should have been in bed getting rest for the next day, but I could not tear myself away from the screen. The film's brutal honesty and the phenomenal performances by the entire cast held me captive till the very end. I cannot say enough positive things to describe this film; from the production to the acting and not least of all the story and its implications.I admire a people that can bear their sins to the world and admit without reservation the historical crimes they committed. No one race or nation on the face of the planet is free of the guilt that is displayed in this film, but it takes humility and courage to make plain to everyone that what was done to a nation, the world, and to select groups of people is the result of misplaced trust in false leaders. What remains is a national scar or cross to bear, if you will, that will not go away for some time. I think parallels could be drawn to contemporary issues and global concerns. One of the many things this film succeeds at is to remind us of the lessons in history.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Questions About Artistic Freedom And Integrity,"I feel quite ambivalent to the movie Der Untergang.On the one hand, there is a chilling realism in the way Hitler is portrayed by Bruno Ganz. The war wounds are realistic, unlike the usual Hollywood/War Department movie garbage.However, there are the apparent historical inaccuracies and cinematic devices. For instance...1) How innocent was Traudl Junge? Her birth name was Gertrude Humps (no pun intended), and she received the name Junge when she married *SS officer* Hans-Hermann Junge. Considering her age, mustn't she also have been a Jungmaedl (the girl equivalent of the Hitler Youth)? She refers to herself as ""not a fanatical nazi"", but of course, she was a nazi nonetheless. People don't just end up employed in Adolf Hitler's bunker by accident. In the movie, she is taken aback by Hitler's anti-semitism, but she does have an apparent dislike of the Russians - whom the Nazis hated for the same insane and pseudoscientific racist reasons they hated Jews, Gypsies, and most Eastern Europeans. I don't know...2) At the end of the movie, we see Traudl Junge, played by the gorgeous Alexandra Maria Lara, make her escape by walking through a large group of Russian soldiers. My problem is that it was known that ""every woman in Berlin"" was raped by Russian soldiers. So how did a gorgeous girl with huge eyes, wearing an army helmet with *SS* in huge markings on the side of it, make her way safely through a crowd of drunken, war weary and traumatized Russian troops? The little boy she takes off with didn't exist and is there as a cinematic device, signifying hope? Traudle Junge cycles off with him into the future, when in reality she was sent to a Russian prison camp.3) How plausible is it that a top level nazi ""just didn't know""? I don't buy it. To quote Traudl Junge, ""We should listen to the voice of conscience. It does not take nearly as much courage as one might think to admit to our mistakes and learn from them. Human beings are in this world to learn and to change themselves in learning."" But the German Socialists knew the Nazis were scum - so did the Communists, Humanists, etc. I'm sure they didn't understand fully how crazy Hitler was, how far he would go in carrying out his ideas, etc. But they knew he was bad news, even back in the thirties.4) The Timeline. Traudl Junge became Hitler's personal secretary in 1942, two years _before_ her SS officer husband was killed. And yet, she is presented as a wide eyed innocent, who doesn't really believe in nazism, and is picked by Hitler in the middle of the night, for no apparent reason. The movie never obviously flashes forward three years to Hitler's last hours in the bunker in 1945.I think the movie needed at least one sympathetic character, and either the director or Junge herself played up her innocence.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
A cinematic master-film on the last 10 days of the Master Race,"It matters not what anyones political views or what there feeling are to Nazi Germany & especially the last 10 days of what happened in the Bunker.This is a MUST film for dedicated film goers, as finally we see this from the German viewpoint. This current year we also have a film seen from the Japanese perspective, LETTERS FROM IWO JIMA.The acting, direction, cinematography, settings etc, is meticulous in detail. Bruno Ganz(perhaps Germany's finest actor) is Adolf Hitler-- not so much in appearance, but in mood & performance, he perfectly captures what what we know about Hitler. All the actors are playing real people, there are no fictional character, & they are all exceedingly realistic.I sat at the edge of my comfortable rocker & was mesmerized by what was gong on, More than once I cringed at certain dialogue,The actress who portrays Frau Goebbels gives her reading of certain lines about her belief in NATIONAL SOCIALIZM in an ice cold monotone that sent a chili thru me,This version is only 156 very fast minutes, They are supposedly going to release a full 3 hour version, When they do I surely will purchase it.Included in the DVD I saw, there is a 1 hour documentary on the making of the film, & they do include a few scenes not on the DVD>.This documentary Is in-itself superb.The long running time went very fast, as the director & editor did there job perfectly.There may be one or two minor problems BUT this is a perfect a film as can possibly be.

You are not likely to be disappointed . . . the best film ever done of this genre',"I know this history well, have studied it for decades. As such, I don't know if it would be possible to execute a more perfect rendering of this moment in time, and the consequences thereof within the final days of Hitler's demise.The portrayal of all the characters, their personalities and actions at the time could not have been more perfectly matched. Having seen the Bunker, and various other films of this genre', I was initially somewhat less than enthusiastic about seeing yet another ""last days in the bunker"" sort of film, but having read various reviews (not just here, but from a variety of sources), my thought was OK, I can take a brief glance at it.However, from the very first few minutes onward, it became immediately apparent that the caliber of acting and direction of this work was far beyond anything I was expecting. Even if you may not be that particularly interested or aware of this history, I would still strongly recommend giving ""Downfall"" a chance, just to experience an excellent example of acting and filmcraft that is rarely presented to current audiences.I was going to try to be at least a bit contrary to the other reviewers, but in all honesty, I can see why the 10 star rating is so consistent, as such is my rating as well. You are not likely to be disappointed.",,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
the human tragedy is shown but not felt,"The film is a good and detailed recount of the events and life in the last days of the Nazi leadership (although, of course, one must be wary that reality *might* have been quite different from the understanding of filmmakers living half a century later).It may serve as colourful illustration to the text-books but for me at least - it remains just there.Indeed - I might not have been prepared enough as an audience but the fact remains - I wasn't touched by most of the drama and tragedy happening for 3 hours in front of me. The only moment that humanly moved me was when Hitler awarded medals to the youth soldiers. The obvious discrepancy between the Icon you are willing to die for, and the shabby disgruntled old man in front of you must have been quite distressing!During the film lots of people blow their brains out yet we don't go through the process of their decision and emotion. Clearly it was not the intention of the director - he avoided any kind of association with the protagonists (maybe today, 60 years later, this still would be TOO scandalous???). Thus he placed us in the position of a street passer-by. For sure all the cast are great and they obviously lived through it (the Hell) but we are offered only the outside shell of their condition - as if Herr Hirschbiegel just happened to be around with a video camera while things were happening.Still it is a step in the right direction - breaking out of the black&white demonisation of Nazi members which is a default in post-war European society.",5.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
One of the best movies dealing with WWII ever!,"I saw the movie in the cinema today and it was definitely one of the best movies dealing with WWII, especially with the person of Adolf Hitler ever. The scene when I saw Hitler the first time, my heart almost stopped beating. It was as if I looked Hitler in the eyes, he was so ""present"" during the movie, and I did not only see the dictator Adolf Hitler, but also the human Adolf Hitler, smiling and hugging people.Bruno Ganzs acting was astounding. He did not only look like Hitler, he also talked and screamed like Hitler. Nominating him for an Academy Award won't happen I guess, but he would deserve it nevertheless.I watched the movie in a big cinema together with 500 other people, and during some scenes (e.g. when Miss Goebbels killed her children), it was so quiet, I thought I was sitting there alone.This is definitely not a ""popcorn""-movie, it is challenging, it takes your breath from the very first second on. Very well made. My rating: 5/5",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
The best German WW II movie ever....,"For the past 15 years it has been, the news from Germany has been, worrisome to say the least: religious intolerance and oppression, neo-Nazis, racism, xenophobia, especially the constant German comments like ""it was the War, it was a long time ago, its over just leave it alone,"" one begins to wonder if in fact the German people ever really understood the magnitude of the crimes they actually committed against Humanity. Then this movie came out. It is without a doubt the finest German movie about the war ever made. In fact it ranks right alongside with the fantastic Jewish film ""Shindler's List"" as one of the truly definitive ""Nazi-movies"" of all time.Normally I am so lazy, I just hate watching foreign language films. Even though I am fluently bilingual I have to put the English sub-titles on Spanish movies so I don't have to think too much. Hell, I'm so lazy and DVD-spoiled that I even put the English sub-titles on English movies! When we started the DVD, I was really annoyed. ""German"" its all in ""German!"" What a rip off! Well I have to admit that after watching the whole movie, I wouldn't have wanted to watch it in English after all. Hitler was German, the Germans speak German. Having seen so many movies with terrible doubling here in Mexico and just how much it can cost a movie's authenticity, I think this was a brilliant decision to put it out in German.Bruno Ganz is simply spell-binding as Hitler. He makes every single earlier rendition of the man pale in comparison. While he can't quite get the mesmerizing, insane charisma just right, (and no-one ever will,) he hits everything else about the character dead center. This is as Oscar-worthy a performance as Kingley (Gandhi), Brando (Godfather), or Scott (Patton). He makes Adolph Hitler live on the screen for those 2 hours plus, like no other actor ever has before.Corinna Harfouch as Magda Goebbels is truly compelling as well as really spooky. The personality, the fanaticism, the madness necessary to slaughter your own children rather than allow them to grow up outside of your own self centered, perverse reality is something no true loving parent could comprehend ever, and that is so well captured in the movie. Unlike most American flicks where we would have been subjected to endless drivel and senseless ""psycho-babblings"" to understand the ""mind"" of Magda, this film spares us that and simply shows what she does, its powerful and riveting.Michael Mendl is also superb in his role of Wehrmacht General Helmuth Weidling. If you want to know how it was that the German military even came close to winning a war in which they were alway seriously outnumbered since the beginning in men, tanks and aircraft, study closely the character of Weidling as portrayed by Mendl, amidst all the whining toadies, hysterical cowards and drunken fools, he storms into Hitler's bunker and announces loudly, ""appearantly I'm to be shot!"" For better of worse, doing his duty to the bitter end, he was the exact type of German officer who made the Wehrmacht the most feared army on the face of the Earth. Great performance.There are so many others who give great performances as well, its a shame that in English language films we won't get to see many of these superb German actors much in the future. With only a couple of exceptions the casting, scripting and acting was brilliant and really re-created the ""last days."" To some critics who complained about the historical accuracy, as a historian and writer, I have no idea what you are talking about. Compared to the absolute falsity and stupid unnecessary ""glitter"" of the majority American war movies, this was extremely accurate and mostly based on eye-witness accounts.To the German people: a simply excellent effort and a brilliant look into a dark corner of a terrible past, as a nation, you should be proud of this movie, the best German WW II movie ever...",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
No Oscar !

Incredible...,"I consider ""Saving Private Ryan"" and ""Schindler's List"" to be pretty much the pinnacle of World War II films. Many others that I've seen, such as ""Windtalkers"" and ""Enemy at the Gates,"" while each great movies in their own right, have never been able to equal the impact and flat-out power of those films. In fact, I believed for a long time that there were likely no war movies, World War II or otherwise, that could match the power of those filmsI'll be the first to admit, however, that my viewing of ""Platoon"" may need serious refreshing and that I've yet to see ""Apocalypse Now"". However, in my experience, even the impressive ""Full Metal Jacket"" fell a little short of the pure visual power of ""Saving Private Ryan"" or ""Schindler's List."" Well, I just finished a film that has done a remarkable job of proving me wrong.""DOWNFALL"" is based on the true story of the final days of the Third Reich in 1945, with incredible realism and stunning storytelling. In a word, I would actually call this film ""riveting."" In fact, I can't remember the last time I watched a foreign film (American that I am) that so intensely held my attention. At any rate, as I began, it takes place during the final days of WWII on the European front. Hitler has become and aged and weakened old man. The stress of illness, war, and his years in leadership have taken a heavy toll. Here, we have a man with a hunched stature and increasingly obvious palsy (I may have this confused with another condition, if I'm wrong I apologize--it may have been Parkinson's). In fact, we have one of the most evil men of the 20th century looking weak, defeated, old, and incredibly human. We view his paranoia growing as we watch his Generals lose faith. We see German people struggle to maintain their loyalty as they are torn by the will to live and escape the constant shelling of Berlin. We see a man who, through his intense hatred, looks weakened and frustrated that the grand plans he had for Germany and his people, well meaning as they may have been, has led to a no-way-out scenario which only continues to worsen. Much of the film is seemingly based upon historical fact, and especially, personal reports from another person whose story is closely followed in the film: That of Hitler's personal secretary, Traudl Junge. Much of what we see in this film was taken from her personal accounts of those last dreadful days.Here's the breakdown:The Good:--First off, there was very little about this film not to like:--The acting is brilliantly done, especially by Bruno Ganzwho is frighteningly perfect as Adolf Hitler.--Excellent cinematography and photographyoften reminiscent of the brilliant, grittily realistic look ""Saving Private Ryan.""--Arguably the highest production value of any foreign film I've yet seen.--Incredible scenery and backgrounds. I can't imagine how this film was made on such a grand scale in tiny, cramped Germany. Even if filmed elsewhere in Europe, I can't quite imagine where they found these areas, so destroyed and so accurate.--Incredible epic scope.--Among the best sound effects I've heard from a foreign filmvery realistic.--Several smaller stories are told which intertwine together brilliantly and give an excellent, all-around view of people, beliefs and opinions of many Germans during the war.Didn't Hurt It, Didn't Help:--The music is good and works perfectly, but nothing truly special or different.--This war epic focuses less on graphic violence (though there is plenty) and more on the violent and conflicting personalities. It is then easier to equate this powerful film to ""Schindler's List"" than to ""Saving Private Ryan"" in this way.--Characters often not properly introducedoccasionally confusing trying to follow all the characters--reminded me of ""Passion of the Christ's"" poor character development.The Bad:--The only problem with this film is that it's so well made, directed, filmed, and acted that I found myself feeling sorry for Nazis and even Hitler at times! The human aspect of this man comes through that well! But worry not, for the more sadistic side of his nature rarely fails to come through and keep you shocked and perhaps even, emotionally confused.The Ugly:--Any time children die.Memorable Scene:--This was another film with so many memorable scenes it's hard to pick just one. I'm going to go with any of the number of scenes where you feel the humanity of Adolf Hitler--because they seriously catch you off-guard.Acting: 10/10 Story: 10/10 Atmosphere: 10/10 Cinematography: 9/10 Character Development: 9/10 Special Effects/Make-up: 10/10 Nudity/Sexuality: 3/10 (very little of either) Violence/Gore: 7/10 (not a ""constant battlefield epic"" so this is a quantity rating) Dialogue: 9/10 Music: 9/10 Direction: 10/10Cheesiness: 0/10 Crappiness: 0/10Overall: 10/10I'm giving a ""10"" to this film for it's overall quality and intense visuals and characters, epic scope, and well, basically everything. I highly recommend this to all fans of War films, especially those of World War II and WWII buffs. All this despite the fact that I believe that ""Schindler's List"" may actually be a slightly better and more powerful film.

Bruno Ganz is my god!,"Oh my god, this movie is easily one of the three best I've ever seen. It is a true masterpiece. Very hard to watch, especially when you know all of it happened in reality. Deciding to base the film just as much on the experiences of Adolf Hitler's secretary and the things she witnessed is brilliant.And Bruno Ganz - my god, if this performance of his is not worth an Oscar, the Hollywood incarnates truly show what lousy stuff they're made of. This film could never have been made anywhere but Germany, making it into an English speaking film would be a disaster (but of course, with their tendency to remake anything over there I wouldn't be surprised! ha ha)..Go and see this film, sure it's a hard thing to watch, but it's an experience for life! 10/10 - no question in my mind!",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Trylly Compelling and Realistic!,"I have seen quite many WW2 films in the past, yet very few of them managed to amaze and shock me as ""Der Untergang"" did. Under Oliver Hirschbiegel's excellent direction, we watch the agonizing last hours inside Hitler's bunker, as accounted for by his young secretary Traudl Junge (Alexandra Maria Lara). We watch Hitler (Bruno Ganz), in his peak of his insanity, as he awaits for imaginary troops to save him and his motherland, while his closest associates start to realize that the game is over and begin to desert him en masse. We watch Eva Brown (Juliane Kohler), who amidst the turmoil and destruction, her main preoccupation is to die looking beautiful, so she chooses the poison instead of the bullet. We watch Frau Goebells (Corinna Harfouch) who prefers to have her children killed than live in a world of ""decadants"". All in all, we watch the members of the Nazi elite and their entourage spending their last moments awaiting their well-deserved fate, with their reactions varying from binge drinking to committing suicide.Bruno Ganz delivers an amazing performance definitely worthy of an Oscar. He is amazing as Hitler, switching from manic and hysterical to sweet and caring, in an a paranoid way. The other members of the cast are also doing a great job, portraying the personalities of that time in a highly realistic way. The fact that the dialogs are in German adds to the astonishing realism of the film even more, making it look like a professional documentary.Some people accused the film for displaying Hitler in a more ""humane"" manner than appropriate. I definitely disagree with the accusation: Hitler is not displayed as humane; he is simply portrayed exactly as he was, namely a paranoid and ruthless fanatic, yet who had also some moments in which he displayed compassion and fondness. The whole point is to see this monstrous personality exactly as he was, and not try to conceal some aspects of his character in the name of political correctness; Hirschbiegel deserves credit for achieving this difficult goal immaculately.""Der Untergang"" is a 10/10 film which everyone should watch.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Excellent film about the Final Days,"'Downfall' is a superb real life account by Hitler's private secretary Traudl Junge detailing the final days of the Third Reich. Based on her memoirs that she released as a book, this film follows events from Junge's point of view, beginning with her employment in 1942 as Hitler's personal secretary, until his subsequent suicide in 1945.Swiss actor Bruno Ganz absolutely steals the film, and probably delivers the best performance of Adolf Hitler that any actor has ever done. He portrays Hitler not only as a tyrant, but shows his more personal attributes too, such as his apparent charm when talking to Junge, and other characteristics that were reported by Hitler's inner circle.This film not only shows the tension from within the bunker, but also shows the chaos and destruction ever building in surrounding Berlin. There are genuinely some very memorable and shocking scenes in this film, that some people may find hard to believe actually happened. But all in all, watching this you actually feel the desperation and chaos as if you are there.Recommended to anyone interested in this period of history.",,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

The film Downfall covers new ground in the war film genre.,"Everyone, regardless of age, has heard something about World War II; as a result, the filmmaker's dilemma is that he or she must show an aspect of the war that is unusual and therefore worth the time and money spent filming. No one benefits from cliché. The last ten days in the lives of the major players--Hitler, Eva Braun, and the Goebbels--as depicted in Downfall, appeals to the viewer who wants to get past what has already been attempted in the war films of the past 60 years. Having said that, any film on World War II will be expected to get the facts right, e.g. the time and manner of Adolf Hitler's death. What is harder to depict is the feelings individuals had about life as they were living it. An art film such as Downfall walks a line between exact correspondence to historical fact and the filmmaker's (and viewers') desire to slant the action toward the interpretation that is most acceptable to a humane, reflective, and well-considered view of ""reality."" What I require of art film as well as biography is a focused perception of this reality, something that raises the human spirit, and our need to triumph over base human motives. The ""reality"" is that in April 1945, the people who worked for Hitler felt differently about the end. Only a few people planned to kill themselves in the bunker with Hitler; most people wanted to survive the end of the war, and get on with their lives--whateer that might be. This point is reinforced throughout the film in the female roles: there are several weepy women who felt they couldn't live without their ""Fuehrer,"" and, in contrast, there were those women (and men) who could walk away after the Russian entry into Berlin, those with the will and knowledge to live on. The culmination of this theme of ambivalent service to Hitler comes near the end when the Nazi doctor argues with an officer: the officer intends to commit suicide, and the doctor can't believe how anyone would choose that. Thus, it seems to me that some people thought it was an honor to kill themselves for Hitler, others were killed by Nazis because they saw what was happening as wrong. Another point is that several people/characters asked Hitler to surrender ""for the sake of the German"" people; it became clear that Hitler never gave a damn about the people who ""served"" him nor about the German Nation. The filmmakers were wise to have the telling of the story cohere around the secretary, Trudl Jung--a sort of ""innocent"" bystander who decided that what she did not know was not going to hurt her. In other words, the secretary was the Everyman who thinks ignorance is bliss. This film has reminded me that real power requires checks and balances on excess; and that people who believe in humanity must speak out against genocide (e.g. the Sudan, Rwanda). See related films, Hotel Rwanda and an older film, The Garden of the Finzi-Continis.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Mesmerising,"Being English, I have a natural disposition to avoid foreign language films, because reading subtitles is a bit of a chore and I'm sure I'm missing out on some of the finer nuances of the dialogue. Nevertheless, after seeing this movie, I almost want to learn German so I can go back and watch this movie without having to worry about subtitles. Not since Europa Europa and Das Boot have I been so impressed with the depth and scope of film making as I have been after Downfall(Der Untergang). Bruno Ganz' performance is just mesmerising and I, like others have said, really did start to believe that Ganz really was Hitler. Support cast were top notch as well. Unmissable.

The Human Face of the Devil,"Suddenly you are face to face with Adolf Hitler. He is in his subterranean fortress, the 'bunker', inside Berlin, surrounded by all his dear ones. Eva Braun, whom he marries just before they both commit suicide. His dog who is also doomed to die. The same as Goebbels and his family which includes seven kids. They have to die because Frau Goebbels does not think that it is worth living in a future without National Socialism. And, of course, there is Traudl Junge, his secretary, who manages to escape in the last moment, and who will later testify to an astonished and bewildered world that all these incredible things have really happenedBaffled you are in each and every moment of this film which lasts 155 minutes, a time which passes in a twinkling. Okay, you hadn't been born, some sixty years ago, but you have read lots of things, you know more or less all the details. And you have also forgotten about it, for plenty of years you have tried to bury the past. Although you live in Germany you were eager to make yourself believe that all Nazis were dead, that 'this' won't ever happen again. After all, Hitler was just an aberration, an accident of nature. Just a monster of the past which bears no meaning for our modern times.Then you are right in front of him, as if you were just another member of his dinner party, listening to his xenophobic viewpoints, shaking your head in disbelief. It is pure authenticity, there are none of the effects that show you that this is just a movie. And then suddenly you see the human face of the devil, you become aware of the fact that this monster shows feelings such as anger and affection, and that he behaves in a perfectly normal fashion: caressing his dog, praising the cook for the spaghettis she prepared, and so on.Those who hadn't been living in the times of the Nazi Reich always tended to put the blame for the atrocities committed in the name of Hitler on the fact that he was simply 'inhuman'. But what is humanity anyway? Does this not also imply that there is a dark side in ourselves, and that in special circumstances everybody might be prone to be such a devil?A man like Hitler is by no means just the product of a peculiar waywardness of history that is dead and buried now. As a German you should be especially sensitive to a possible reawakening of Nazi ideologies of every shade. Recent developments show you that the resurrected devil is just outside the door. In the region where I live, the Ore Mountains, elections were held some weeks ago, and a Neonazi list gained about 12 per cent of all the votes, nourishing themselves predominantly from the young. Although the arts have never really led to but a slender change of people's awareness, 'Der Untergang' is a fair try and has appeared just in time to counteract a dangerously destructive tendency in our society.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Brilliant humanising portrayal of Hitler's final days.,"""Downfall"" is the dramatisation of Joachim Fest's marvellous book, detailing the thankfully premature end of Hitler's Thousand-Year Reich.We follow Traudl Junge, who in 1942 is given the immense privilege of becoming Hitler's personal secretary. The real Traudl provides commentary at the beginning and end of the film that helps provide a moral compass reading for this immaculately detailed and forceful dramatisation.I expected to see something much more stagy and claustrophobic, but the film counterpoints the stark, sterile bunker against the gutted streets of battlefield Berlin, this is clearly no made-for-TV historical drama, the evocation of a city, and a people on the edge of destruction are grimly realistic and clinically accurate. The violence seems somewhat inconsistent, we see very little blood and guts, we see something of the horrors of a make-shift surgery, along with hack-saw amputations, but this is far removed from ""Saving Private Ryan"". Maybe Oliver Hirschbiegel thought that overt gore might be considered a distraction from what's really important, maybe so, but this for me stood as the only real inconsistency in the production.The dark heart of the film is of course Adolf Hitler. Bruno Ganz provides a portrayal of Hitler that transcends impersonation, we see a man who is greater than the sum of his world famous odd-ball mannerisms, Ganz provides a level of humanity and reality that makes the unfolding events all the more compelling to watch. We meet Hitler the tee-total, dog-loving vegetarian, a man who often shows great compassion and humility. The Hitler we expect to see, the man gripped by nationalistic paranoia and chilling racism is ever present, ready at any moment to launch into venomous rants that become increasingly irrational and unhinged as he descends into the titular downfall.While Ganz is always enthralling to watch, we know what we're getting with Hitler, much more interesting are the Nazi clique. Amongst Hitler's closest confidants we have Joseph and Magfa Goebbels, whose zeal for Hitler's new order renders them into suicide-cultists, unable to accept the possibility of life after the death of their leader, even for their six children. Likewise for Eva Braun, whose devotion to her beloved Hitler is so complete that she wantonly shares his fate.The film gained most controversy with its representation Nazis like Prof. Ernst-Günter Schenck (humanitarian and rationalist). You are reminded that you can no more judge a man by his uniform, than a book by its cover. You never sense that the film is trying to mitigate Nazi crimes, but remind you that the crimes were committed by humans with varying degrees of complicity.In the end ""Downfall"" is an important reminder that we demonize the Nazis at our very great peril. Winning the war on our terms we were able to paint Nazism as some kind of supernatural plague. I often hear people say how important it is that we remember what the Germans did, so that such evil can never again be allowed to go unchecked. What's wrong with this? Since 1945 the unspeakable evil of the Nazis seems to have worked as an effective camouflage for numerous horrors, from the ravages of Stalinism and China's Cultural Revolution right up to Rwanda and Yugoslavia. It seems to me that the only lesson we have learnt from the Nazis is that if you want to perpetrate massive acts of unspeakable evil, keep the noise down, complacent super powers are trying to sleep!",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
"Berlin or Bagdad, Bombing Still Kills","Sit in the movie with bombs bursting all around you, and tell me you can't feel for the people of Bagdad. Listen to the secretary say, ""We didn't know, but we should have.""...Hitler's REAL secretary who died 2 years ago......and think of our sheeple in America. They had no clue that their country was becoming a dictatorship, where the monsters running the federal government cared nothing for the people, but only for power. Any similarities to Amerika, where our media are owned by the corporations who diddle the puppet strings of Bush? Excellent portrayals of the families so mesmerized by the charisma of this Bush-like Hitler that they murdered their children and themselves. You know this happened but to see Medusa Goebbels (or was it Goering) poisoning her children, one of them resisting) or to see the Doctor of the obscene medical experiments blowing his family up at dinner is to have the real charisma of this monster exemplified.Watching Hitler be tender to the secretary wasn't difficult, as it's important to know that he was just like us. He just had the power of charisma (how sad that a word would come from Christ to represent these indescribably evil people). The sound effects of the bombing of Berlin, the hanging of the Germans who wouldn't fight, even as their 'empire' collapsed around them.....all this was so evocative of the end days of our own country. As I exited the theatre, other people were remarking on the similarities between the German 'patriots'.. Hitler followers... and our sheeple, willfully indifferent to the slaughter by their excellently trained armies of innocent people. Hitler's insanity is well emphasized by his continual planning, his announcement that new planes were being supplied (by Bush's grandfather, who was stopped by our government finally from financing the Luftwaffe factories) even as Berlin crumbles around him. The suicides by the Army officers were so sad, because they truly believed that our government would be as brutal to them as they were to our prisoners. Then, no; now, yes with our architects of torture at the highest level of our government. Encourage your fellow citizens to see this movie. If they are not completely anesthetized by the Bush propaganda machine, they will see the parallels. Of course it won't, but it should win some Oscars for the excellent acting, writing and sound effects.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
"Better than expected, but still an anti-national socialist propaganda movie","I have mixed feelings about this movie. Acting is impressive (even if the actors impersonating the German generals are unable to reproduce the hard, metal-like Prussian cadence), special effects are well-made, and it nicely conveys the depressive and claustrophobic feeling of the cramped life in the bunkers. It also conveys an adequate feeling of war's brutality.The plot refrains from the most obtuse stereotypes of anti-National Socialist propaganda, and truly depicts some human sides of Hitler and his entourage. However, it remains a very unbalanced representation of reality, intended to impress the viewer's mind with political and ideological prejudices. For example, all Nazi characters wishing to carry on the fight - from high-ranking SS officials to Hitlerjugend kids fighting on the barricades - always fall in one of two stereotypes, either that of the unthinking, automaton soldier speaking in a machine-like way, or that of the equally unthinking, naive kid automatically repeating the slogans impressed upon him. On the contrary, all characters purporting a quick surrender are represented as wise and judicious individuals, speaking in warm overtones from the wealth of their life experience.The movie's worst aspect consists its portrayal of Hitler. Instead of depicting the dialectics of rigorous lucidity and rambling illusions, of stern self-control and furious outbursts that characterized the dictator's last days, the film brings to life a rambling old man who has lost nearly all contacts with reality. In this movie Hitler is no religious prophet and political genius, partially broken by the immensity of defeat and bad health conditions, but a madman babbling his nonsense to an audience so foolish and subservient as not to see its obvious foolishness - a poor travesty of historical reality.Whenever Bruno Ganz enunciates one of his most infamous (to the believers in the political religion of human rights and racial equality) precepts, he always does so in an especially rambling and stuttering way, and such principles are extrapolated from their context, to produce an impression of bleakness and near-madness. This tendency is made obvious in the scene where Hitler dictates his political testament: since there was no way to twist the text in the byproduct of an impoverished mind, we are just allowed to hear its first few words, then the scene is quickly shifted. In other cases this approach leads to historical falsification -- it happens in the scene where Hitler is asked what to do in case ammunition is entirely spent. Fest, in his ""Hitler. Eine Biographie"", unequivocally states that the dictator answered that in this case defenders should try to flee by small groups, while in the movie Ganz furiously waves his fist and mumbles ""I shall never capitulate, never!"".The movie makers' tendentious intentions are made even more plain in the final scene, where a smiling Frau Junge travels away with a newly found stray kid, and the clouds part in the far skies, to impress on the viewer the idea that a nightmare is now over, and that a new and better age is starting for the survivors of Nazi madness. The short interview to the real Frau Junge, which is incorporated in the end segment, makes the movie's political underground impossible to miss. This movie does not attempt to impress the viewers with problems and interrogations, allowing him to find his own answers; instead it attempts to impose answers on him, defaming the National Socialist world view.All this notwithstanding the apprehensions expressed by some members of the Establishment, that this movie could mitigate the effect of regime antifascist propaganda, are in my opinion justified: as the movie slanders National Socialism in a less coarse and loud way than usual, it shall be probably able to impress the herd's minds with lesser force.Finally, this movie is probably the best that can be filmed on this subject under the present political regime; it has several bonus points, yet each viewer, especially young viewers, should go to the box-office conscious of its preposterous background.",,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
3 hours of my life wasted to find out Hitler was a bad guy but human.,"Maybe this will start a new trend for showing histories villains in a new light. Watch out next year for Pol Pot the musical. He had a funny side as well. Unfortunately the film misses a great opportunity to say something original, and is a one trick story, filmed from the perspective of Hitler's bunker.

Dramatization of the last days of Hitler in his Berlin bunker,"This was an outstanding movie with excellent performances by all, especially Bruno Ganz as Adolph Hitler. The scene where Frau Goebbels murders her 6 children rather that have them live in a world without the 3rd Reich is horrifying, but true. The scenes of shelling and shooting on the streets of Berlin and the vivid display of wounds and amputations. Hitler's descent into disbelief that the war is lost, and that surrender is the only option are riveting. With the Soviet armies less than a mile away, Hitler orders non-existent troops to repulse the invaders with a pincer-movement. The inability of all but a few generals to report the truth of the situation, while the majority pander to Hitler's phantoms is, as far as we know, a true characterization.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Hail Hitler !!!,"Hitler is definitely one of the most enigmatic and larger-than-life personalities to have lived in the 20th century. His views, ideologies are very disturbing and smell of hatred and detest towards a particular community. His actions confirm his distorted view of the world and the amount of damage that it inflicted on humanity as a whole.'The Downfall' captures the last few days in the life of this person as seen by a lady personal assistant. It is most certainly one of the best movies to have been made on Hitler. The Direction, cinematography, acting, are all top class. Most of the movie is shot inside the famed bunkers of Hitler.Movie shows how Hitler in spite of realizing that the war was lost, kept on making fantasy plans of how he would be defending Germany while his closest troops stood in silence. One of the highlights of the movie is the portrayal of Hitler by Bruno Ganz. It is as if one is seeing Hitler himself, and not some actor trying to impersonate him. He is that good.Some of the scenes leave a lasting impression.

Humanizing Hitler...,"A compelling and provocative film detailing Hitler's last days.Bruno Ganz is outstanding as the Fuhrer himself, in what I think was definitely a performance worthy of at least an Oscar Nomination.Downfall does not involve the horrors of the Holocaust nor the bloody waters of the Normandy beaches, but the crumbling state of a disintegrating Germany where the SS is unable to withstand the Russians' ruthless assault and enclosure on Berlin.This is an excellent account of the lives and troubles of Hitler and the men surrounding him in his final days as Germany kneels down for an inevitable surrender.What this film does in an effort to document and visualise Hitler as a human and not as a monster is somehow admirable. It is rare to see an attempt to estimate this dictator as a human being; one that can be charming and polite and simultaneously switch into becoming a ruthless, brutal figure dictating the deaths of millions.This is a heavy film. It is disturbing, distressing and depressing. However it is a wonderful recreation of the last days of Nazism and Hitler. Oliver Hirschbiegel's film is a masterful documentation of one of history' most tyrannous, but ultimately fascinating figures and the environment around him.""An intense, human masterpiece""""Bruno Ganz is superb.

Not much fun in this Hell,"The Germans have finally made a World War II movie with Hitler in it as a main character, hitherto a taboo for them, like showing Queen Elizabeth in a movie for the English, presumably for different reasons. Hirshbiegel's film gives us Hitler's last days in an unpalatable mix of generals, women, children murdered to save them from a world without National Socialism, Berlin crumbling around the Führer's meandering bunker, booms and crashes echoing around the auditorium.The result is a harrowing and powerful but also plodding. It's as if director Hirschbiegel was so focused on just getting all the terror, gloom, and horror of it down on film he didn't step back to breathe. There's not much sense of pacing or rhythm. There's a steady unwinding, of course -- after all this is the devolution to end all devolutions -- but there's not much suspense or sense of calculated contrast between successive scenes. Maybe there isn't any room for art in such a story. But then you have to ask why ""Downfall"" was made, and the only answer is to provide some kind of catharsis for German viewers.The director has epic ambitions. He not only covers the moods of the bunker on every level from general down to the lowest orderly (it's ""Upstairs Downstairs"" all played below), but also takes us up to street level where Berlin crumbles as the Russians move in, and it dives through battlefield hospitals teeming with moaning, screaming wounded and grizzled, exhausted surgeons sawing off limbs. (Why does the camera ritually shake every time there's a big explosion? It's a fake-looking effect.) We see so many people pop cyanide pills and blow their brains out it becomes almost routine. And we are witnesses to the kind of terrible battlefield gore we saw in Spielberg's ""Saving Private Ryan"" and more recently in Jeunet's ""Very Long Engagement.""But in fact, in ""Downfall's"" foreground, inside Hitler's bunker, there's no real action except the decision to do nothing, not to yield, to go down with the ship. This is the Endgame, the checkmate: the ""king"" is cornered. There's a lot of talk about escaping or surrendering but neither is going to happen. It all stays in the bunker till the end. Consequently the movie is character-driven, and succeeds best in impersonating known figures.Most importantly, Hirschbiegel has engaged a marvelous actor, Bruno Ganz, to play a fully rounded version of the doomed Hitler. Over-saturated color and ill judged sickly lighting -- however accurate a reproduction the latter may be of the underground setting -- make the generals look like waxworks, but Ganz's Hitler is three-dimensional and has all the qualities ever attributed to him. He screams and yelps at the generals in a voice uncannily right, he's soft as a puppy-dog with women and children; and there are all stages of madness and folly and denial in between. Ganz can do as much with his face seen from the side as he can do with his stooped exhausted body, his twittering left hand hidden behind his back, and his voice rasping and cawing as he curses his generals, brags of dealing with the Jews, and condemns the German people to die -- but mild and soothing to the strangely cheerful Eva Braun, and sweet and forgiving as he hires a secretary. This is no mere impersonation: it makes Hitler real and complex.That's disturbing to many viewers, especially Jewish ones, who have protested this movie should not even have been made; that even to look Hitler in the eye and see a human being taints the memory of the millions who died in the camps. But this is wrong. We don't need a cardboard man to know the Nazis were the personification of evil. The hard truth of evil's banality -- and commonality -- was dramatized by Hannah Arendt's reportage of the Eichmann trial in 1963.After suicides have happened and corpses have been torched and officers have left to fight over whether to surrender, ""Downfall"" narrates a terrifying escape by several women, including Traudl Junge, Hitler's young secretary, beyond the Russian soldiers and out of Berlin. There's a little poetry -- perhaps the only moment when the movie sings in any conventional sense -- when Junge, already seen in Heller and Schmiderer's documentary, ""Blind Spot,"" two years ago (to which this film owes much), escapes hand in hand with a small blond boy and cycles cross-country with him under a bright clear open sky (escapes, as the documentary shows, to a lifetime of guilt). Finally here is contrast, a flight from the bunker that sets off the grim experiences we've witnessed inside it.Unfortunately, though, we've already seen so many cinematic depictions of depraved Nazi officers getting drunk amid naked girls (a classic version is Visconti's lugubrious and cloying ""The Damned"") that even when Eva Braun is one of the celebrants there's a numbed sense of déjà vu. Outside the bunker, up above, the dark sequences of mere children in soldier's uniforms playing the doomed hero are disgusting and heartbreaking, but that was an aspect of the final days of the Nazis that had its ultimate cinematic expression long ago in Berhhard Wicki's powerful 1959 anti-war movie, ""Die Brücke."" No, the only thing that makes ""Downfall"" different is the bunker, and Hirschbiegel might have done better to have stayed down there and never let us out. Hitler certainly never got out, except to be incinerated so the Allies wouldn't get his corpse. This is not a great movie, but it's a powerful one. It deserves to be seen, if you can handle the claustrophobic nightmares it may give you.",,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Dark and depressing,"Downfall is a depressingly downbeat film. I mean, there might be a lesser degree of depression related to it because we are watching the demise of the Nazi regime, and these are genocidal murderers after all. But they take you into the inner sanctum and we look on as these men and women watch their lives quickly coming to an end. Even when they are fascist generals, it's kind of rough seeing this number of suicides, and how even the women and children are expected to go down with the ship. There was a certain point where I was thinking ""Enough already!"" as one more soldier blew his own brains up. I understand that they are aiming for a level of authenticity in the story-telling, and these events did happen when the Axis had lost the war, but watching it play out in this slow methodical fashion is exhausting.One of the strangest choices of Downfall was the shifting perspective. From the beginning it feels as though we are entering into this movie to watch it all from the perspective of Hitler's final personal secretary. This was an interesting framework, particularly because she was still alive at the time of filming, so she could tell her own story and that could directly influence the script. Yet as the film progresses the narrative is often shifting and we sit in on countless events that she was not present for and certainly would not know. If they took the first-hand accounts of many different people who were there and also any written documentation, then I suspect this would be fine, but then they need to drop the opening and any pretense that she is a protagonist. Downfall is an effective story, but it's far from a fun film to watch for anything more than a history lesson.",5.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Will we ever learn?,"Unfortunately there are still many people around the world in denial that these atrocities ever took place. Today's youth don't even know much about WWII (if at all) and when asked who Hitler was, quite a number think that he is a current president of some country, but most just don't know.This movie is probably the best and most accurate portrayal of the last days in the bunker based on the book written by Hitler's secretary. Most other war films are fictional and dramatized and eye account documentaries on this subject become scarcer as time goes by.Important lessons are learnt from history, but without this acquired knowledge wars reoccur and many are raging around the world as we speak.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
"WWII from the Nazi perspective: A tough task and even tougher experience, but profound and necessary","Not just any World War II film or dramatization of Nazis, ""Downfall"" gets up close and personal with the Third Reich and its key members, recounting Adolf Hitler's final days in a Berlin bunker as Soviet troops besieged the city.No one has had to play Hitler in quite the way ""Downfall"" requires of Bruno Ganz. This is not a good vs. evil, Axis and Allies WWII epic that reminds us all of the wickedness of Nazism and the great tragedy of the Holocaust. Screenwriter Bernd Eichinger wants to — with as much historical accuracy as possible — explore the Fuhrer behind the facade, the megalomaniacal idealist as he's confronted with his inevitable failure. With Oliver Hirschbiegel's stark direction and Ganz's multi-faceted performance, ""Downfall"" strips away the legend of Hitler and other high-ranking Nazis and provides a grim, pitiful portrait of a movement's dying breaths.In addition to a book compiled by historian Joachim Fest, the story comes from the accounts of Traudl Junge, Hitler's secretary from 1942 through his death, who survived following the Nazis' surrender. Hirschbiegel actually bookends the film with testimonial footage of the real Junge reflecting on being young and naive, and how she played ignorant and absolved herself of any guilt at the time and now has trouble forgiving herself.Junge's character (played by Alexandra Maria Lara) is the closest thing the film has to a protagonist, yet the film isn't presented entirely from her perspective. The story features an extensive list of characters, from notable names like Goebbels (Ulrich Matthes) and Himmler (Ulrich Noethen) to an array of military officers, doctors, children and volunteer fighters and more. It actually starts to get extremely confusing, but Eichinger was clearly determined not to exclude any one person or type of person, and the payoff comes in the form of the various ways these many characters responded to knowing the end was coming, which presents us with an array of fascinating psychological case studies.Most fascinating of them all, of course is Hitler, who the film depicts as making careful preparations for his suicide knowing it was only a matter of time, but who refused to surrender and continued to bark military orders as if confident that a the final victory was still achievable. Ganz's performance has hints of the fiery orator most people are familiar with, but also a sensitivity and a sadness as he realizes just how many of his people have betrayed him by giving up and that was his failure. That's not to say Ganz or ""Downfall"" humanize Hitler to the extent that we actually feel sorry for him, but even those who believe so ardently in an evil ideology must confront failures, their legacy and death.Hitler also knew he had lost, and the film portrays him of being at peace with it, so what's more chilling is the way others respond, those who were naive, those who went along with Nazism out of cowardice, and those who became so swept up in Nazi dogma that they couldn't toss it away in the face of objective truth and logic. Maybe more fascinating than Hitler's perspective is that of the prominent Nazi women in the film, Hitler's longtime partner Eva Braun (Juliane Kohler) and Maegda Goebbels (Corinna Harfouch). Both women remain loyal in spite of their fate, but handle the waning moments different. Maegda's decision to bring her six children into the bunker, for one, has a particularly harrowing effect on the film.""Downfall"" doesn't have the cinematic qualities of most WWII films. In fact, it might be better suited as a play with its limited set and variety of scenes featuring conversations between a host of different characters. The constant shelling of Berlin throughout the entire film provides ample context for the drama underground that the story doesn't need most of the outdoor ""action"" sequences.That said, Hirschbiegel does not glorify war or violence; his film portrays both rather matter-of-factly. In fact, he's a little inconsistent in how he uses blood and gore — the amount of it varies from scene to scene, but the amount of death in the film is staggering and a profound component of the experience of the film. ""Downfall"" kind of presents everything at face value, a rather critical decision considering the highly sensitive nature of the story and its characters.Every WWII film, especially one about Nazism and the Holocaust, must have a niche and unique perspective considering how often filmmakers dip into its well of stories. Yet they do it because humanity will never quite understand how the Nazis were able to take power and how the Holocaust was allowed to happen. ""Downfall,"" as difficult a viewing experience as it is, unquestionably fills in one part of the picture of one of history's darkest chapters, a section that could've easily gone unpainted.~Steven CThanks for reading.

Riveting,"Downfall views an extremely convincing, totally intriguing portrayal of Adolph Hitler, whom we know so much about, yet we are intensely engrossed in Bruno Ganz's performance. We have always known what he's done, but it takes an extremely well-directed, very powerful film like Downfall, showcasing Ganz in a lifetime's performance, to realize immediately that he saw so clearly and stubbornly his focal point in life. In scenes where he loses his temper, we see a man who is of course headstrong and violent, but not at all haywire. He had ideas etched in stone and when people did not understand, they suffered his wrath.Also, rather than a safe, worried little American film that would never show him doing anything but screaming and massacring people, perhaps it takes the perspective of a German film, whose perspective not only counts greatly in a film about the Third Reich, quite obviously, but also, frankly, being a European film, is much more trustworthy in its appearance of honesty. The perspective of the main character, who is not Hitler but one of his naive secretaries, sees an authentically generous individual, who does have a questionable semblance of a heart, even when she sees him cruelly and disgustingly test poison on one of his loyal dogs. From a clever point of view of naivete, we actually see the raw Hitler unbiased, though we're aware of his inordinate viciousness, who is broad and extremely practical in his ways, yet his nature is so dominant that he frequently finds it rather difficult to work his loyal Nazis. As we hear him angrily snarl in his bunker, we hear an exceedingly determined monster who possesses unlimited faith in his own knowledge.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

It's a psychological movie about human nature, power and a sense of unity which can carry people beyond total madness.

Corroboration,"I was lucky enough to see this film accompanied by a lecture by a survivor of the German side of the war. He is a professor of German at the University of Minnesota, and in March of 1945, was an 18 year-old Jew living in Berlin. He escaped deportation, as he was half Jewish.He not only told the audience of the details of life in Berlin at the time, but praised the film for its ability to faithfully recreate the city's conditions in the spring of '45. He also was amazed at how much Bruno Ganz sounded like Hitler. He said it was chilling to hear his words in the theater, sound so much like the voice he was familiar with in his youth.One of the most amazing things he brought to the lecture was a copy of the last newspaper printed in Nazi Berlin, featuring the story of the little boy who fired on the Soviet tank, as shown in the film. This made ""Downfall"" feel like so much more than a film... it was like a true slice of history.",,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Beware historical inaccuracies,"From _The Hitler Book: The Secret Dossier Prepared for Stalinfrom the Interrogations of Hitler's Personal Aides_, Edited byHenrik Eberle and Matthias Uhl, PUBLICAFFAIRS, 2005.""_The Hitler Book_ has since beenproved one of the best primary sources on the inner workings of the ThirdReich that we possess. It also called into question several scenes inDownfall.""Downfall provoked a lively debate, above all in Germany. The Swiss actorBruno Ganz's portrayal of a 'human' Hitler clashed with a conventionwhich requires him to be cast as a carpet-biting devil. Audiences saw aworried, frightened and tearful Fuhrer; they witnessed him kiss his newwife Eva on the mouth (The Hitler Book makes it clear that he kissed her --like a good Austrian -- on the hand); they saw his concern for the well-being of his secretaries; and they saw the demon too, but one mitigatedperhaps by human (rather than humane) emotions. They saw a normalwoman love him, and excuse his conduct. More shocking perhaps (but thisaroused far less outcry) the film turned a butcher like SS-BrigadefuhrerWilhelm Mohnke into an honourable soldier and the SS doctor ErnstGunther Schenck into something approaching a Hollywood hero, despitethe fact that he had carried out experiments on the prisoners in Nazi con-centration camps....""According to The Hitler Book afew of the dictator's alleged tantrums never actually took place.""But such scenes provide spectacular cinema and necessarily made theirway into Bernd Eichinger's Oscar-nominated 2005 film Downfall. An eloquent example of this is the alleged tantrum that was caused by Fegelein'streachery. The cinema-goer hears Hitler, beside himself with fury, bellowing 'Treachery!', 'Fegelein! Fegelein! Fegelein!', and the script emphasizes, 'Each time Hitler beats the table with his fist. His face is so red thatit is fit to explode.' In reality Hitler had to be told by Gunsche, the BattleCommander of the Government District, to hand his brother-in-law overto the court martial. Other scenes in the film are either pure invention orstem from unreliable witnesses. The last visit of Speer's was clearly lessemotional than its depiction in the film; and the secretary Traudl Junge wasnot, as is shown in the film, saved by a boy but raped many times and wasfor several months the 'personal prisoner' of a high-ranking officer inSoviet intelligence.

The end of a human monster,"This is undoubtedly one of the best movies I've ever seen. Its direction is almost perfect in all its aspects: sceneries, camera movements, screen-play, acting, technical features, etc.. The character of Hitler is so well performed by Bruno Ganz that we forget that we are before an actor and come to think we are before Hitler himself. The movie shows with striking realism all the contrast between the almost normal and quiet bunker scenes and the awful war ones taking place outside with all their fights and the drama lived by the civil population. Inside the bunker we watch the progressive psychological and physical decay of the dictator still surrounded for his few fanatic supporters still ready to die for him and his ideology when outside in the city all crumbles under Soviet fire. The mad man still believes the war can be won and in the map he moves military units and divisions that don't exist anymore. Since monsters can sometimes also be human beings we can watch sometimes a few human and even generous attitudes of Hitler and his followers. Some people have criticized this as attempts to show Hitler and the Nazis under a more favourable light. I don't agree with this. Realism is realism and must not be Manichean. If we want to know a human being (though a monster) in all his entirety we must know all of his or her features. The movie is realistic in all its aspects and with extreme rigour. All the characters act just like we expect them to do and incarnate extremely well the real people they are supposed to do.

A Harrowing and Humanizing Depiction of Hitler's Final Days,"*Der Untergang* (*Downfall*, 2004), directed by Oliver Hirschbiegel, is a powerful historical drama that chronicles Adolf Hitler's final days in his Berlin bunker during the closing weeks of World War II. Based on the accounts of Traudl Junge, Hitler's secretary, and other historical sources, the film provides an unflinching portrayal of the collapse of the Third Reich and the chaos that engulfed Berlin in 1945.Bruno Ganz's portrayal of Hitler is astonishing and widely regarded as one of the most compelling and nuanced performances in cinematic history. Ganz humanizes Hitler in a way that is deeply unsettling-he shows moments of vulnerability and frailty while still maintaining the tyrant's cold, delusional rage. This duality makes Hitler's character all the more terrifying, as the audience witnesses his total emotional and mental collapse while he remains oblivious to the devastation he has wrought on the world.The film does not shy away from showing the horrors and desperation inside the bunker as Hitler's closest associates grapple with the inevitable defeat of the Nazi regime. Corinna Harfouch's portrayal of Magda Goebbels, in particular, is haunting, as she prepares to murder her children rather than see them live in a world without Nazism. The supporting cast, including Alexandra Maria Lara as Traudl Junge, provides a perspective of how ordinary people became complicit in extraordinary evil.Visually, the film captures the claustrophobia and tension within the bunker, as well as the devastating destruction of Berlin. The sense of impending doom permeates every scene, heightened by the excellent production design that meticulously recreates the bunker's suffocating environment.*Der Untergang* has received praise for its historical accuracy and attention to detail, though it has also generated controversy for its portrayal of Hitler as a complex human being rather than a one-dimensional monster. Some critics argue that this risks eliciting sympathy for Hitler, but the film makes no attempt to excuse or glorify him. Instead, it offers a sober look at the final days of a regime built on hatred and lies, and the destructive consequences of unchecked power.The film's pacing can feel slow at times, as it focuses heavily on the bunker's claustrophobic atmosphere, but this serves to reflect the slow, painful unraveling of the Nazi leadership. The tension builds gradually, creating a sense of dread that mirrors the inevitable collapse of the Third Reich.Overall, *Der Untergang* is a gripping and emotionally intense film that offers a complex, disturbing, and human look at one of history's darkest moments. It's a thought-provoking exploration of power, fanaticism, and the devastating consequences of war, anchored by one of the greatest performances in modern cinema.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

If seen the downfall recently and I really like the movie.I won't talk about the actors because they were OK to me it was more important that we saw a very ""dangerous"" side of Hitler. Because it is soo easy to imagine all the time th person you see during the speeches but the way they try to show him within the movie makes it nearly impossible to paint a picture of the Nazis looking like robots. I'd say it is a good try to show the schizophrenic side of people who could kill other ones for they race at the KZ and go home after work to work in the garden as nowadays one comes back from his work. If you see this they appear human to you and no one can say Ah Hitler was an Idiot I would have gone into the resistance at once. The only thing I personally disliked was the outdoor action. Hm I don't think that we need a lesson of anatomy. You don't have to show the scenes in occupied Berlin with such brutality. The play of th actors in the bunker itself was already frightening enough -in my opinion.

Almost faultless,"Downfall has to be one of the best movies ever made.I have just watched the DVD (which includes extensive extras about the making of the film, interviews and biographies of the subjects), which makes the third viewing for me. There are few movies that I care to see this many times.Small errors of continuity aside, the impressive attention to detail, the casting, the acting and direction, sets, cinematography, sound - everything about this movie is to me just about perfect. The fact that it was made for 13m is astonishing: many Hollywood movies with a fraction of this class would have shelled that out to the lead star.Casting such a story - the last few days of the Third Reich, mainly in the Berlin bunker to which Hitler and his coterie of believers retreated - presented a near-impossible task. Recent history, especially when so freely documented and photographed, allows only a small latitude with character portrayal: finding actors who so closely resembled the players such as Hitler, Himmler, Goebbels and the rest and were capable of playing them so well has been brilliantly achieved.Much of the outdoor action was filmed in St Petersburg, Russia: a whole street was taken over for nine days and changed into wartorn Berlin to remarkable effect. The logistics behind this alone merit total admiration.In some ways it is remarkable that it has taken so long to bring this story to the screen in this genre, and it is a tribute to the German people that it came about at all. The decision not to dub an English track over the original German, but instead to provide subtitles, might be seen by some as incorrect: in many films this would be so, but here it is absolutely right. The full impact of the Fuhrer's ranting, his malevolent diatribes, can only be appreciated by listening to them in German, whether one speaks the language or not.If you haven't already seen this film, do yourself a favour and buy the DVD. If you *have* seen it - do yourself a favour and buy the DVD.(Edited, 31st Dec 2010: The proliferation of YouTube clips of the Fuhrer throwing his toys out of the pram shows how a truly awful monster can be laughed into history as an aberration in the human race.)",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
downfall,"There must be as many movie versions of Hitler's final days as there are of the gunfight at the OK Corral. Well, this is the best of them. Not much to add to the previous reviews except to note the appropriateness of this raving, delusional psycho dying in a bunker since that is where he lived most of his adult life, in the airless, fanatical crypt of National Socialism. Otherwise, I pretty much echo what the vast majority of my fellow IMDBers wrote, both pro (Bruno Ganz is the finest male Teutonic actor ever) and con (easily forty five minutes should have been cut since a lot of the film's punch is pulled due to excessive length and repetition). Give it a B.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Brilliant!,"This film is a truly admirable attempt to examine the character and mindset of Hitler and those closest to him. Indeed, I think it must be the most engaging and thought-provoking WWII movie I have seen. If this had been a Hollywood production with Hollywood stars it would not have had this impact, but it is German-made and its director (Oliver Hirschbiegel) seemed to go out of his way to avoid leading the viewer to any conclusion, instead allowing everyone to form their own opinion based on the facts. Too often the horrors of WWII led writers and directors to depict Nazis as monsters, but this misses the real story; the question of how they became monsters. In a way, the human Hitler which Hirschbiegel shows us is more guilty than a raving monster since it is clear he made choices to do wrong.Bruno Ganz is absolutely convincing as Hitler, Ulrich Matthes plays Joseph Goebbels wonderfully, and indeed the rest of the cast are all excellent.Highly recommended viewing and well worth the almost three hours running time.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Incredible historical piece,"I was struck most by the degree of humanity that Mr. Ganz gave Adolf Hitler. He accentuates both his angry side and his more sedate side fantastically. There are also scenes in this movie where Mr. Ganz portrays Adolf Hitler as vulnerable, and other times he's even portrayed him as somewhat sweet. These characterizations; of course, come nowhere near mitigation for the evils of this man released on the planet. Even the most vicious of tyrants can show her humanistic side on occasion. Nevertheless; this movie was an incredible historical recount of Adolf Hitler's last days. Mr. Ganz; in my humble opinion, did an incredible job of portraying this complex individual. All of the acting in this movie is top rate. I must admit; I was brought here by the parody videos on YouTube. Nevertheless, I'm glad I was led here as this was an exceptional dramatic performance.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
"Powerful, and yet strangely inadequate","US Air Force General Curtis E Lemay, who supervised the atomic bombings of undefended Hiroshima and Nagasaki, infamously talked of ""bombing them back to the stone age"", and grimly joked: ""If we got to start over again, I want Adam and Eve to be Americans"". That's what happened to Berlin. A great left-wing city, the city of Christopher Isherwood and Cabaret, turned into a vast burned-out shell, with sister cities Hamburg and Dresden flattened by allied bombing. Seven million Germans are said to have been wandering homeless in April 1945, bombed out of their homes by Churchill's murderous war on civilians. The massive armoured columns that had fanned out over Eastern Europe as far as the gates of Moscow, nearly taking the oilfields of Baku thousands of miles away, had been wiped out by the Soviet hordes, and now the yellow menace was invading the Kuhrfurstendamm, drunken, raping and pillaging. In a bunker we witness the madman Adolf Schickelgruber, alias Hitler, cursing his nation and condemning them to death with him. Everyone is a traitor, and even now as the house collapses on his head, he is willing to order people summarily shot. How to capture the scale, the scope of this overwhelming disaster? From ruling a continent to controlling a city block, all in a couple of years! Truly, it's beyond the power of one feature film, but this German team has tried, and produced a drama that is compelling and yet lingeringly inadequate. How can you possibly show a whole city being raped? How to depict more than 150,000 individual women being multiply violated in the greatest unpunished sex crime of the modern era? Most of all, how do you explain and convey the magnetism of Schickelgruber, the angry little corporal determined to get his own back on behalf of a whole people? Stripped of his state trappings, Bruno Ganz's fuhrer is little more than a nobody with a mammoth chip on his shoulder who believes the Prussian elite has turned against him. It is ultimately inexplicable how he hypnotised the German nation and actually managed to get elected and formally appointed Chancellor, unless you blame it on the threat from the vast Communist empire next door. Germans must be somewhat bewildered to glimpse Berliners carving meat off dead horses in the ruined streets, considering their standard of living is twice that of any other European country today. They don't know the half of it, and this film, for all its merits, won't tell them.",,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Simply uninteresting.,"A throughout unrealistic movie, I did not even manage to get through to its end (watching it on DVD, I fast-forwarded the remaining few minutes).No, this is not a good story, this is not even a credible or likely story, it does not seem to have any realistic touch about it, which is quite a surprise in case of ""hystorical movies"", as this one aspires to be.I could not name anything I liked about it.WW movies usually either have the looks and the ketchup (Saving Private Ryan), or the plot (Sunshine), or the characters (La Vita é Bella), or all of it (Schindler's List). Der Untergang has none of these.I believe that in case of such topics, a movie should be made in the event that it has to offer something: a new perspective or approach, new characters, anything at all.To me Der Untergang was a disappointment all together, surely awarded for the topic, and not the actual realization.",1.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Magnificent,"If you were to only ever watch one movie about WW2 then this should be it. An absolutely fabulous interpretation of the last days of one of history's most infamous characters. Incredibly acted by Bruno Ganz, it leaves you wondering how he could possibly not receive the Oscar for his work. It must go down as one of the finest acting performances in history. As others have said, Ganz is Hitler. To say that the movie runs over two hours and is largely shot inside Hitler's bunk, it rarely if ever loses interest. A splendid support cast, authentic if limited action scenes around Berlin and a surprise twist at the end with the secondary story line, all adds up to a magnificent movie. I must say though that the scene involving the fate of Josef Goebbels children is extremely difficult to watch and may haunt you for some time to come after the movie has finished. Superior to even the marvelous Das Boot, this movie is a triumph for all concerned. Without doubt the greatest Anti War movie I have ever watched. 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
This is a must-watch movie...,"With his 2004 movie ""Der Untergang"" (aka ""Downfall""), director Oliver Hirschbiegel delivered quite an amazing movie. This is such a hard-hitting movie and one that most definitely deserves to be seen, regardless of you having an interest in World War II or not. Why? Well, because it is a powerful story and one that proves that history must never be forgotten.Writer Bernd Eichinger put together a powerful and memorable script and story, based on the books by Joachim Fest, Traudl Junge and Melissa Müller. The storyline told in ""Der Untergang"" is one that will stick with you for a long time.I am really amazed with the storytelling in ""Der Untergang"", because director Oliver Hirschbiegel takes the audience along on a very emotional journey throughout the 156 minutes that the movie runs for. You might think that 156 minutes is a long runtime, but it actually is not, because the story is so nicely told, so interesting and so encompassing that you just get swept up and carried along the narrative as it unfolds and shows the last days of the regime of Adolf Hitler and the end of his Third Reich.Leading actor Bruno Ganz, playing Adolf Hitler, puts on such an amazing performance in this movie that it is hard not to be impressed. Bruno Ganz's performance in ""Der Untergang"" is so powerful that his performance alone makes the movie well-worth watching. In fact, the entire cast ensemble in the movie put on great performances individually, and that really added so much to the overall presentation of the movie.""Der Untergang"" is a movie that leaves quite an impression upon the viewer.And the fact that everything is kept in German, and some Russian language as well, makes it all the more believable and authentic. If this movie was dubbed, it would be an affront to writer Bernd Eichinger and director Oliver Hirschbiegel.The costume and props departments worked their magic to make ""Der Untergang"" look and feel like a proper World War II movie, which definitely was a crucial factor for the overall impact of the movie. It looks and feels the way it is supposed to, and that kind of authenticism really makes all the difference.If you haven't already seen ""Der Untergang"", then you most certainly should do so, should you get the chance. This is a must-watch movie.My rating of ""Der Untergang"" lands on a nine out of ten stars.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
A stunning portrayal of evil and defeat.,"There are I think 4 films about the last days of Hitler, of which this is the latest. The others are : The Death of Adolph Hitler Frank Finlay January 1973 UK TV 107 mins. Hitler : The Last Ten Days Alec Guinness May 1973 108 mins. The Bunker Anthony Hopkins January 1981 USA TV 150 mins.Which is the best ? Each has its own undoubted merits. I have recently viewed all of them again. All are riveting. All these films make for uncomfortable viewing. It should not be otherwise. The knowledge that these are in essence accounts of real events makes it so. All make attempts to be as accurate as the data to hand at the time allowed. Downfall is almost certainly the best all round and probably the most authentic account, despite the fact that I have an inbuilt dislike of watching subtitled films! (My German is not good enough to follow it without the subtitles). Of course, being German dialogue does give it added verisimilitude. Ganz is quite superb. Listening to the Director's commentary (on a separate audio track on the DVD  in English, thank goodness!) it is clear that the entire company had thought the whole film through thoroughly and used whatever they could in the way of documents and accounts to make it as accurate as possible  not just the events themselves, but the character of each of the players. The most horrifying and gripping scene in Downfall is not the sick rages of the demented maniac  made all the more effective by showing other sides of Hitler's personality  but the scene where Magda Goebbels kills her own children. Somehow, this awful act summarises the terrible regime that was allowed to infect the earth for 12 years. Sterling performances by all concerned.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
The best ww2 film ever made,"Well, let me say, regarding the historical accuracy, the costumes, the script, the performance of the actors, this is the best ww2 film ever. I read some competent historical books about what had happened those days( in the bunker, and all about the suicides). I must say, except the fact that gen. Bugdorf's body wasn't found in, so we can't yet proof 100% that he committed suicide, all the other details are driven from pure and liquid reality.(I mean of course the main suicides' scenes).In other ways, the film is a very realistic description of ww2, 100%. Of course, it may bother some people who should read more before qualify all German's ww2 soldiers as Nazi criminals or getting a ""scape goat"" out of Germany for all the ww2 war crimes, because it simply isn't like that. All the belligerent parts have their one role in the number of innocent victims. The difference between German films of ww2 and the allied ones is that in the first category we find examples of crimes made including by their own former countrymen, which of course we don't find in the Russian, English and American films of this kind( except Letters of Iwo Jima, when that Japanese prisoner is murdered). Just see the film and you'll know what I'm talking about.Also, a big mark of realism in the street-fights, huge amount of historical resources like uniforms, military equipment and other things that give the note of the historical accuracy.About the actors, I must say, the one who plays Hitler is simply brilliant. Also you should watch closely Thomas Kretschmann and A.M. Lara in their acts.Here you got to feel the last days of the European war from different perspectives, following Hitler, his secretary, his generals, a HJ young-boy, a medic, Eva Brown, etc; in each's personal type of struggle. Every minute you get the feeling of the collapse of an empire, when some choose to stay and face the downfall, others to escape by all means possible, others to die by their own hand and others to hope that after all had passed away, they will be strong enough to rebuild their lives...",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

"Overly Long, Moving and Expertly Acted","There is a lot going in 'Downfall'. The film's somewhat chaotic shifting back and forth between environments correctly creates a certain theme of confusion, however often minor characters receive insufficient screen time or properly explained character progression, which is a flaw in the movie considering it's enormous runtime.Bruno Ganz is sensational and gives one of the best performances I've seen for a movie of this genre. In addition, Ulrich Matthes gives a beautiful and quietly angry portrayal of one of many distraught Germans struggling in disbelief.The direction for the most part is good, and the film demonstrates competency with quiet traumatising moments of defeatism, however the overall movie has a lot of fluctuation in scene interest, and some moments feel outright irrelevant, repetitive or boring. Some of it should have been cut and more focus should have been on characters that were better acted and deserving of focus to really create that permanent feel the movie deserves.",5.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Undeniably Brilliant,"I sometimes find films in a foreign language difficult to follow and a little bit tedious. I had heard a lot about 'Downfall', with many claiming it to be the greatest Second World War film ever made. Now while this may be a bit of a stretch, it is nonetheless a fantastic film which any war film lover should watch.The story is of course well-known, however the way in which it is told it is something special. Following the diary entries of a young secretary, the film adequately captures the mix of panic, frustration and even jubilance that was present in the bunker. Of course for any English speaker, it is a bit annoying to have to read the dialogue, but I suggest anyone who is put off by this to not be. The film is more than worth the reading. I personally feel that this is better than 'Letters From Iwo Jima'.A fantastic film, with very good acting and clever directing allows this film to more than deservedly be in the Top 250.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Hitler was human. And that's the point.,"After watching this movie, I was intrigued as to why anyone might have 'hated it', and after reading the relevant IMDb reviews, I think I know. There were actually many reasons given; objections to everything from acting to sets to direction and more, but in light of the movie's evident quality they seemed to be nit-picking at best. The acting is first-rate, as is the rest of 'Downfall'. This is a powerful, gripping movie with characterisations so well-realised (Hitler himself, secretary Traudl, the supremely creepy Josef and Magda Goebbels and many others) they will haunt you. What the 'hated it' reviewers actually didn't like was the humanistic portrayal of Hitler. The hunched, shuffling and twitching 'grandfatherly' Hitler of 'Downfall' is a far cry from the long-familiar vigorous, raving 'madman' incarnations of popular culture. How anyone could have got a 'sympathetic' treatment of Hitler out of this movie is unfathomable. Yes, this Hitler is an ailing, crotchety, prematurely aged and even a vulnerable man; sweet to Eva Braun and his pretty young secretaries, but also the architect of the global madness which has backfired so catastrophically and is even now smashing its way towards him and everyone else hiding in his bunker. It is a tragedy of Shakespearian proportions, and entirely Hitler's doing. All of the executions, infanticide, suicide, revenge atrocities and madness of those last days of the Battle of Berlin are the end product of decades of his work. One of the most vehement 'hated it' criticisms was that the past crimes of the Third Reich (principally the Final Solution) were not detailed in the screenplay, but there is little need to gratuitously invoke the Holocaust with this tsunami of death, destruction and insanity bearing down on Hitler, his associates and his beloved Germany. To leave it as a barely-mentioned background feature makes its creator seem even more reprehensible, not less; because it is as if he didn't care about anything but his place in history. In the end, he is crushed and even tearful that it all ended this way, but he cries for himself, not the millions he has caused to die. Hitler has a human face, and is all the more terrifying for it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

A Relentlessly Honest Movie Recounting Hitler's 'Downfall'!,"Downfall, Oliver Hirschbiegel's thoroughly devastating digest of the Third Reich's final days, isn't about commuting the sentence that history gave the Nazis, but heeding its warning - a gruesome, sustained-tension lesson about informed politics.The movie is based on the final ten days of the Third Reich, as told from the perspective of several key figures that were present in the bowels of a dank bunker beneath a burning Berlin that Adolf Hitler retreated to, as Germany was invaded by the Russian forces in 1945. Hitler, now hunched-over parody of himself, seems defeated from the moment we see him, but his megalomania and outright insanity is always lurking just beneath the surface. On some level, we sense — as do some of the characters in the film — that Hitler knows it's all over for him and his Reich, but that doesn't prevent him from ranting about delusional betrayals, moving nonexistent armies across maps and blatantly refusing to surrender even in the face of certain downfall. But Hitler's mindset is not the entire crux of this complex film, which is really just as concerned, and possibly more so, with his inner circle's reaction to impending doom. Once thriving individuals in the streets of a city that showered them in rude luxuries, they have now been reduced to mere rats in an underground maze. As the dream around them crumbles into heaps of rubble and their followers become corpses in crowded alleys, we watch the hope and strength fade from their faces. Like the characters of the best of Shakespeare's tragedies, they occupy the narrative like shattered mirrors of themselves, retreating to the safety of their self-delusions and often reflecting on the reasons for their imminent destiny, as if to quietly confess their evil and seek some semblance of respect before the end comes.Downfall takes on the unenviable task of portraying Hitler as a human being, rather than a caricature or larger-than-life monster as the norm has dictated. But while doing so, Hirschbiegel simply strips away the myth from the monster, laying bare the utter banality of his evil. It features a staggeringly creepy performance by Bruno Ganz, whose Hitler is both a raving psychotic and a beaten, melancholic man. He generates indelible ferocity as Hitler - his composure snapping at will and foam frothing during his delusional flights of fancy about military might. He takes hold of the job with clenched fists; his manner of expression and the growl in his voice are so meticulous and researched, there is seldom a moment we consciously think about it as a performance; it is an uncompromised embodiment.Downfall is a spine-chilling experience, a masterpiece of filmmaking which conclusively damns the repetition of its history. It is an unflinching, hard, relentlessly honest movie that refuses to ask questions that have easy answers. But even with all the tough questions the movie poses, it remains a long stare into an abyss from which no comforting answers can emerge.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Awesome And Deeply Tragic Drama,"Well, it is never easy to make a film about such a terrible monster as Adolf Hilter, without either falling into a blunt, bland, straight at your face slogan accusation agitation ditty, or a totally unrealistic and outward silly.Der Untergang did a tremendous job showing a very real and very psychotic Hitler as he was. And that was not a small trifle. The film did a truly outstanding job of showing Hitler as a totally mad, but still cunning, violent but still thinking person. he is a tyrant, a monster, a real murderer and he is a cannibal, devouring Germany as a simple bite to pay for his fallen ambitions. His suffering and death are viewed with a great satisfaction, but not simply because - the film shows why and shows what for. I will not get into a greater detail, as it will bake spoilers, I only say - watch this, watch this tremendous masterpiece as it depicts the madness of last days of Reich, the cruelty of war, the senselessness of Nazism and wantonness of evil. Great movie, awesome casting, powerful message - war is all Evil.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Impressive,"A wonderful and apparently historically accurate retelling of the final day's of Hitler and Nazi Germany. The actors were cast in a way so they resemble the historical figures quite closely, and the battle scenes kept me on the edge of my seat. If anybody has ever watched LEXX, you will recognize Rolf Kanies playing Hans Krebs. His fluent Russian in real life came in handy as his character had to speak in Russian during the negotiations with General Tschuikov. The movie didn't try to make any particular character appealing, except maybe for Ernst Gunter-Schenk. Considering how this bunch of men were responsible for 50 million dead it was a good idea to not portray any of the characters as 'good guys' anyway.There was an amazing amount of research put into the film. The uniforms strove to be accurate, even the weapons and sidearms were the kind you would have seen in 1945 such as the StG44. Probably the only slip-up was the Russian soldiers all had PPSh's, and none had the PPS, which was more commonly seen in 1945. The only other niggle was a reference to ""penicillin"" in a phone conversation from a field commander but the Germans didn't have penicillin during WWII.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Ganz' tour de force,"Bruno Ganz acts out of his skin in a performance that may just give an inkling why some people actually liked the real Hitler. Ranging from full-throated demagogue to crushed old man, he dominates the film, even when he isn't on screen, supported by some excellent performances from Corinna Harfouch and Ulrich Matthes as the odious Dr and Mrs Goebbels and Juliane Köhler as an Eva Braun who isn't perhaps as much of an airhead as we like to think. Add in the doe-eyed Alexandra Maria Lara and a wonderfully claustrophobic bunker set where you can almost smell the people boxed up for days on end, and you have a wonderful film. It isn't always comfortable viewing, but it's hugely compelling.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
History performed with lightning... makes me wish there was more of its kind,"The last 10 days of the 3rd Reich has been fodder for plenty of films over the years, easy to make a 3-act structure around and showcase the fascinating final days of a corrupt dictator losing touch with reality. It's easy too fall into the realm of cliche with every character in one form or another having to cope with the fact that within a few days, nothing in their lives will ever be the same again... their system of government, their jobs, their family life, their society. Everything is soon to end.Compared with THE BUNKER (1981) and HITLER: THE LAST 10 DAYS (1973), this film feels much more ""real"". Similarly with the others, it makes Albert Speer the natural voice of reason but strangely enough also puts Hermann Fegelein in this role once Speer leaves. Traudl Junge, though very much of Hitler's entourage, serves as the center of the film's point of view, giving the audience someone to side with due to her pure naivety.Good narrative technique here showcases some truly spectacular performances, principally Bruno Ganz as Hitler. He doesn't quite capture Hitler's look as well as Alec Guinness and his voice sounds too raspy and high-pitched, but his mannerisms and commitment to the part are truly a part to behold. He plays his role not of a screaming tyrant (like Anthony Hopkins) but of a human being exhibiting both the ego-driven confidence of a superstar yet the panicked tantrums of a 4-year-old when he does't get his way. Of all the historical films I've seen, this is the most difficult in which to forget that I'm just watching a movie and haven't been somehow transported magically back to the past no matter how many times I've seen it.The main rewatchability for me now comes from anaylzing the supporting players, all of Hitler's generals and ""friends"" who stuck by his side to the end. Some, such as Jodl, Mohkne, and Speer were more clear-thinking, while others such as Goebbels had likely lost touch with reality even more-so. It's fascinating to see how people cope with their world crumbling in around them, helpless to do much about it, yet at the same time obeying the rules of their corrupt system and worshiping tyrants who made their own megalomania and insanity that much clearer by the day. In a rarity for films of this kind, a few characters belonging to the SS (namely Mohnke and Schenk) are even given a sympathetic portrayal trying to save lives and end unnecessary bloodshed, giving this film authenticity in terms of presenting the events in moral shades of grey as opposed to black and white.That said, DOWNFALL shuffles a lot of historical events around for sake of its narrative which bothered me. Goering, for instance, sent his telegram prior to Hitler's birthday and the shelling of Berlin by the Soviets. Fegelein was arrested prior to Himmler's ""betrayal"" too and events only played out vaguely in the chronology that the film presents. I suppose that is one of the greatest difficulties of making a historical film; accurately conveying causality and fairness to historical characters while at the same time keeping things interesting to the audience.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Don't miss that movie.,"The general reported to Hitler: ""During the fight for Berlin, we already lost 15 to 20 thousand of our best younger officers."".Hitler's response : "".... but that's what young men are for.""This movie blows everything out of the water in terms of WW2 movies and it will stick with me - that's for sure. This is a must-watch movie, to find out what kind of person Hitler was. And a valuable document for the following generations.In this movie, you also get a sense of the people who were close to him. Who all were like puppets with a few exceptions, after it became clear, that the war was lost.And as others have mentioned before, saying, he was mentally ill would kind of protect him in terms of his crimes. Hitler wasn't mentally ill, not at all. He was fully aware of his decisions, but he was a psychopath. Psychopathy isn't a rarity by the way, it is estimated that 1 to 2 % of all males are psychopaths, and this number is significantly higher in leading positions. His personality was the worst possible for someone who gets their hands on too much power. Especially with Goebbels on his side.He was a textbook version of a psychopath and the film shows that very clearly. Those people are masters of manipulation of others. They do it with charming intelligence, which is a typical aspect of psychopathy.Bruno Ganz did it a terrific job, all of them, all of the actors, of Goebbels and his wife, Eva Braun, the generals and officers etc. Are convincing.And you also get a feeling for the suffering of the German people. Millions suffered under his cold-blooded decisions. His last one was pure evilness: ""I will not surrender - never"". Which was only an ego thing. Because, losing the war was unavoidable, but surrendering would have stopped the attacks. Nevertheless, Hitler wanted to keep fighting a war that was already lost.He could have saved civilians, women, children and the elderly by surrendering, But his ego was in the way. He said: ""There are no civilians in a war like this. If I fall, they must fall with me. This is how nature works, it eliminates the weak which is natural selection.""",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

The best film about the Second World War - bar none,"As a huge history buff, I found Downfall riveting, exciting, and ultimately somber as people (both good and bad) are destroyed in the final days of the Third Reich. While the film portrays the downfall of the Nazi Germany and with it some of the most notorious people of the 20th century, it rips its audience into the emotions of the soldiers, civilians, and Nazi hierarchy as Berlin burns.I love this film because it is presented from a German perspective. Most World War 2 films involving Germans portray them as the ""universal bad guys"" out of convenience due to the well-known atrocities committed under the leadership of Adolf Hitler. This film steps above that overplayed convenience; there are good Germans and bad Germans and they must watch together as Berlin crumbles. This film follows through on how various Germans react to the collapse of Berlin, including Hitler, Braun, the Goebbels family, Spear, and a host of officers and civilians.I have seen most films about the Second World War, and Downfall is the best of them all. Yes, it is better than Saving Private Ryan. Yes, it is better than Schindler's List. This is a MUST WATCH film for anyone who is interested in the Second World War.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Cannot see what seems to be so compelling about Down Fall,"Went to see Down Fall because I heard Bruno Ganz was worth seeing. He was worth seeing. But after the sixth or seventh of his scenes I found his role and his portrayal of Hitler uninteresting. The movie was not worth watching; though I suppose if you wanted a synopsis of what went on in the bunker the story covers a lot of ground. I left the theater after the sound of the shot. We are led to believe that Hitler has shot himself. Main gripes: Too long, Cheap looking locations, Too many characters (OK so there were a lot of people who wanted Hitler to surrender, to leave, to try and lessen the horror of Berlin's citizens) I couldn't see the purpose of recounting each one, This looked liked what it was; a made for TV movie. We get a glimpse of one viewpoint. The newly wed Eva Braun tries to suggest that maybe Hitler was of two distinct persona. The man versus the leader of the National Socialists.

Downfall,"This film has had its critics, not least David Irving who complained that it owed a substantial but unacknowledged debt to the final chapters of his own 'Hitler's War' and is probably now best known as the basis of an unending succession of parodies that made Bruno Ganz a comedy favourite on YouTube.Some might take issue at the film's failure to accurately convey the sheer malevolence of the regime the characters served and instead depicting them as they fondly saw themselves rather as they now look to history. But for once the fuhrer is accurately depicted as the prematurely aged, shuffling wreck he had become in his final days.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Upon German's eyes the final word over Hitler at bunker!!!,"This gloomy and last chapter of WWII has been told many times, however never upon German's eyes mainly by still unknown Hitler's secretary Traudl Junge's notes wrote afterward those sad events witnessed on the bunker, even anyone hadn't enough outline precisely the own bunker itself, so it was a great puzzle where each info has been fulfilled the entire picture what's really happened on those deep and tight shelter.Bruno Ganz made a stunning performance of the ever-evil Hitler, no one even reaches closest as the Fuher, all Nazi members within down there, as Goebbels, Albert Speer, Herman Fegelein, General Weidling just named a few as major characters including Hitler's mistress Eva Braun, therefore the newest Traudl Junge appears to certify all those early rumblings exposed on previous pictures, although for me many dialogues shown on movie are merely for dramatization purpose only, there aren't any reliable source due some chat were made at closed door for those died aftermaths by own hands, upon this point of view on many scenes are purely speculative.The Germans producers and director and the whole crew involved in such outstanding production were hardly criticized even by their fellow-countrymen, despite that they kept steady at their early proposition, for me it's the finest and the final world about Hitler last days.Thanks for reading.Resume:First watch: 2024 / How many: 1 / Source: Blu-ray / Rating: 9.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

"Cinematic ally ""Downfall"" is a non-event","I found ""Downfall"" boring and too long. Compared to Hotel Rwanda which was thrilling and chilling, ""Downfall"" was neither - it was a trivial movie.

Indeed it portrays nothing in particular about this horrific person.

Stunning,"I must admit I wasn't intimate friends with the guy, but drawing from history I can not imagine a much different Hitler than the one portrayed by Bruno Ganz. He is at times terrifying, stubborn, and ruthless, while at other times he is... well... much the same. Ganz also manages to capture the charisma that drew so many close to this dangerous man. The rest of the cast was spot on as well, as the sense of urgency in the ranks of the Nazi Party reaches fever pitch. Any Neo-Nazi would be well served to view this tale of their furor at his most feeble and deranged time, as they might begin to question why they follow such a leader.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
truly great,Ganz's monologue in the bunker is one of the all time great monologues ever. Talking about an actor giving his all to a part. This one scene is worth the price of admission.What else is admirable is their approach to Hitler. They just tell the truth as accurately as possible. They let Hitler tell his own story and you make your own judgement. Free of being manipulated with a predetermined moral judgement the film has a much more powerful impact. Great history and entertainment.The German people loved Hitler at one time. The Russian People love Putin. A few defeats for both did not and will not change that. Defeating Hitler was a long difficult fight. Putin will be the same.,9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
The Downfall,"With the interest to see a balanced view of Hitler during the 2008 holocaust week, this movie was recommended by colleague Andreas Hensel.The movie is partly based on the book written by Traudl Junge (Alexandria Maria Lara), the final private secretary of Adolf Hitler (Bruno Ganz) and it narrates the story of the final downfall of Germany to Allied forces. It shows Hitler in a very pensive, defeated mood due to the losses in the war. The movie also shows a more balance portrayal of Hitler (and not one-track characterization) as shown in the other movie Hitler  the Rise of Evil.Bruno Ganz has done a great job in being Hitler. Again like I said for Robert Carlyle who played Hitler in Rise of Evil, it is hard to believe any other person playing the role of Hitler as Bruno has done. Comparison is bound to take place, but both these actors have done justice to their roles  that show different portions of Hitler's life.The over-shadowing dominance of Hitler over his commanders, and the helplessness of the situation the German army was in  worn out, marginalized, defeated  but still fighting, is saddening to see. Hitler was blindly worshipped by Germans, and there were people who literally believed that he is the ultimate savior  the God, and his words are final.Hitler deciding his own suicide rather than surrendering, so that he can be remembered as a great hero  has not lasted in the pages of history, or did not last after the World War II. Today everyone treats him like a monster, and realizes the blunders of the holocaust.An excellent movie by Director Oliver Hirschbiegel. Sadly this movie  though a brilliant one  did not win an Oscar in best foreign film category. I hear that there were people who did not like its nomination too in Oscars.But I still wait for a real balanced portrayal of Hitler in a movie format.

"Riveting, beautiful, powerful...","DER UNTERGANG has to be one of the best WWII movies ever made, and it is unfortunate that it will not receive as many accolades as it should due to its international origin, limited release, and somewhat controversial subject manner.The film is the third of its kind to account Adolf Hitler's last 10 days in Berlin before his death (I highly doubt that this qualifies as a spoiler), and though I have not seen the previous two, I have no doubt that DER UNTERGANG is the best of the three, otherwise I surely would have heard more of those other movies.I was informed that Der Fuhrer was presented in a rather sympathetic way in this film, which was the cause of some controversy, but upon viewing I can say that nothing can be further from the truth. Bruno Ganz presents Hitler as a vile, pathetic (not sympathetic), angry, short-tempered, megalomaniacal, bitter individual whose primary beliefs are a perversion of the theory of Natural Selection: that the weak must be left to perish while the strong survive, and any assisting of the weak (and hence Humanity in general) goes against Nature. Ganz's performance is captivating, and he steals every scene in which he appears, which is no surprise given his role. His presentation of Hitler is quite easily the best ever seen in cinematic history, and he owed a lot of his preparation to listening to previously hidden recordings of Hitler in his final days, as well as studying Parkinson's disease patients.The cast, while mostly unknown outside Germany, does incredibly well, and there is no scene in which any cast member seems to falter to weaken the movie. While the film is primarily about Hitler, director Oliver Hirschbiegel has no hesitancies in broadening the scope of the film (quite effectively) to include 'bit-players', while still managing to keep the primary focus at the forefront of the viewer's thoughts. The one scene in which Hitler manages to escape the thoughts of the viewers is the bone-chilling and shocking scene coming down to the end involving a mother and her children. It is a scene that is difficult to stomach due to its subject matter and accurate portrayal; one that serves to highlight how dangerous such blind loyalties can become.The film is as historically accurate as it is beautiful. I am an avid fan of good WWII flicks, and I have to say, in terms of presentation and historical accuracy, DER UNTERGANG has to rank as one of the finest. It is an awesome character study of one of the most malevolent beings in modern history, one that makes today's terrorists and super-villains seem like naughty children who lost their playthings. This is a truly riveting and well-crafted piece of cinema, whose subject matter is treated exceedingly well.4 stars (out of 4). 9/10. Should enter my Top 100 at about 62 or so.

Excellent.,"This is simply the film transposition of the memories of the last secretary of Adolf Hitler, the Bavarian girl Traudl Junge. Its a historical document in film, insofar as its absolutely faithful to facts and history. Hitler was a man with a magnetic charisma and personality, who manipulated people and created in Germany a powerful cult of the leader, through which he became almost unassailable, doing everything he wanted without anyone having the possibility of oppose. We can imagine this manipulative power seeing his generals shaking as ill-behaved boys in one of its most famous scenes. We watch everything: the dictator commanding imaginary troops, inventing plans and dream cities, but also directing, in a ruthlessly and cunning way, the few that were faithful to him until the end. The gap between the reality in and off the bunker and the general insensitivity to the suffering of the country is brutally glaring. The actors are illustrious strangers, to the extent that I have never heard of any of them, but the work developed is enough for the film to work very well. In fact, the film is not an acting show, although its good. The value of the film is in the script and story told, no matter how well known it is. It has very strong scenes, some of them absolutely unsuitable for minors and more sensitive people.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Outstanding reconstruction of the Third Reich,"First thing, Bruno Ganz's performance is just the most realistic and only performance that is just like the real Hitler. Everyone in that entire movie, looked so much like their real-life version in the film. Movies like this that focus on making it realistic and accurate as possible seems impossible to do--but Downfall made it possible for any filming crew to search and want these pieces for making a brilliant movie. It also feels more authentic than the other movies about Hitler due to the natural German language. I'm actually glad there's no English dub as they usually would do for foreign language movies--I prefer subtitles over a dub! There are some things that are inaccurate. For instance, Fegelein was a Gruppenfuehrer in real-life during the last days, but in the movie he was a Brigadefuehrer. Those minor inaccuracies don't bother me, but if it's only I'm focusing on another character.Furthermore, Downfall has to be the most brilliant World War II movie on the final days of the Fuehrer I have ever seen.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Good,"This is a movie that I have watched many, many times. When it was available on DVD, I bought the genuine version. Later, I watched it many times to practice my German, and I repeatedly listened to many dialogues. Later, the ""F ü hrer's Roar"" became popular on the internet, with various parodies. I have seen no less than ten versions.Now, when I am very desperate, I will also dig out this movie and watch it - this is the true despair.When commenting on this movie, there is no need to pay attention to the issue of spoilers. The movie is about real things, such as documentaries, the Siege of Berlin, the destruction of empires, and so on.But the German name is very simple - Der Untergang, without the words Das Reiche. So, it's not just the empire that's being destroyed.Do you remember, there were dead people hanging everywhere on the streets of Berlin, with signs on their bodies - I was hanged here because I was a coward.Do you remember what Hitler's roars said - even if we die, we will hold a world with flames soaring high to mourn for us.Here, I don't want to comment too much on Hitler, but I'll quote a quote I heard here - he had all the talents of a genius, but lacked the basic humanity of a normal person.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

Come On Guys! Chaplin and Allen!,"I'm not that keen on the film there were sparks of promising moments but disappeared with suicide the only character that I did feel sorry for was the poor secretary being put through something that was probably an un-decided future working for a psychotic Jew hater. The narrative obviously had a subliminal message we are sorry for Hitler he weren't that bad. I just do not understand the great fascination and sympathy for a man that should have no respect for what he stands for which is rather hellish, I feel that they are trying to show that he isn't that bad but a normal human doing what any normal human is thinking and doing unfortunately for the Germans, Italians and Austrians I will not be fooled by pure trickery. But a common think that seems to be in the most recent of war films of foreign soldiers is suicide take for granted The Letters From Iwo Jima although that is a lot better and looks better. I was also anticipating something as good as Das Boot. But I did like a lot of the shots that made you feel quite moving and gripping like that young boy. What made this movie memorable to me were the scenes in which we could see the cruelty and sickening determination of some German officers and soldiers to fulfill their Führer's orders even when it was clear he had committed suicide. What I also liked was Bruno Ganz performance. I feel that it is just a flattering portrait of a evil regime and the devil himself. It shows quite a dark and profoundly horrifying ordeal of a death of there Fúrher and would go to any lengths to save there believes even dying with them. Probably the most eye opening and memorable scene is of when the mother killed her children showing that she feels that nothing is worth living if the Nazi's fall. And shows a kind of domino effect with one falling all the others do as well. It also showed that they were so dependant on him. . It shows that Hitler is visibally shrinking and shaking as he contemplates the third riech and almost alternating from despair and madness. Plus Charlie Chaplin and Woody Allen are Jewish so I side with them two",2.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Hitler would have been proud roasting in Hell,"May be the best WWII movie I have seen after Saving Private Ryan though both of them deals with completely opposite perspectives and different genres. The screen time allocated to the Bunker and its attention to detail virtually transports you there. Seeing Hitler as a delusional old man with a pompous past and a deserted family now rather than the monster we have seen him as so far is surreal. The director evokes mixed feeling for Hitler making you feel for his precarious state while simultaneously loathe the hatred that engulfed him, not just on Jews but mankind itself.Berlin is surrounded by Allied Forces and Adolf Hitler (Bruno Ganz) and his top brass have secluded themselves into a well furnished Bunker. The story is partially seen through the eyes of his young secretary Traudl Junge (Alexandra Maria Lara). Hitler is delusional about a non-existent army that can push its way from behind and scatter the enemy. While this places courage in some, places horrendous fear in most. Mostly deals with Hitler's final days, his current views on the war and utter disrespect to life, his relationship with Eva Braun (Juliane Köhler) and an ever faithful family, the Goebbels.While the melodrama is in the air, the director takes care not to push it into the face of the viewer. Alexandra has such a pleasing innocent face, she will almost make you believe how Ms. Junge saw through the ordeal without making out much of it. While most of the cast deliver competent performances, Bruno Ganz would have made Hitler proud with his ecstatic emotional outbursts alternating with subtle body language that speaks a thousand words without saying anything. How he missed the Oscar, I am interested to see who beat him to comment on it. After the Russian artillery comes into the range of the Bunker - every dialogue, emotion and action is associated with fear or being skeptical about optimism which is brilliantly shown when Eva Braun forces a party to overcome the impending doom. While most of the action is said and understood, the director didn't shy away from showing a peek on the outside of Berlin which is full of fear, hordes of corpses and strewn away limbs drawing from a strong graphic content and state-of-art pyrotechnics. The background score is mostly non-existent and but delicately used whenever required. Screenplay and editing are slick without a dull moment and builds up enough suspense leading up to one of the most known endings.Hitler would have been proud roasting in Hell",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
The Crumbling of the Reich During Its Last Days from Hitler's Bunker: The Ideology Was More Difficult to Topple than Germany's Armies,"According to the events of the film, which I assume are mostly accurate with some liberal aspects for cinematic effect, the ideology of the Nazi regime took much longer and was far more difficult to crumble than the buildings, infrastructure and military operations of the Third Reich. This film not only takes the viewer inside the bunker where Adolph Hitler and Eva Braun committed suicide in late April, 1945, it takes us inside the heads of the most loyal Nazis. And what we learn about these people is as terrifying in many ways as what the Nazis did to millions of people across Europe outside the confines of Hitler's final residence.The structure begins and ends with an interview as cinematic bookends. A real-life survivor of the Reich who had been one of Hitler's private secretaries during the final years of the Third Reich, Traudl Junge, appears on screen. Now an old woman, she describes how she was enthralled to receive the opportunity to become a member of Hitler's inner circle. At the end, she alludes to the fact she didn't think for herself.The narrative scenes begin in 1942 with Traudl Junge among a group of aspiring young women wishing to work for Adolph Hitler (Bruno Ganz), dictator and self-proclaimed savior of Germany. Not surprising, Junge (Alexandra Maria Lara) is chosen for the job by the Führer himself. Then the film cuts to April 20, 1945, Hitler's 56th birthday. It's inevitable to everyone involved that not only is Germany going to lose the war against the allies, but Berlin is only days away from being taken by the Russian Army. Hitler's inner circle, including Heinrich Himmler and Joseph Goebbels, insist that it's time for him, Eva Braun, and the rest of his inner circle to evacuate Berlin. Hitler refuses, claiming it would be a sign of cowardice and surrender. Before going underground, he awards Iron Crosses to members of ""Hitler's Youth"". Then he moves his operation into an underground bunker where he and his closest associates will try to keep the Reich together during its final days.The events which transpire in this film are some of the most disturbing and devastating as any film about World War II and the Reich I've ever seen. While all the residents of the bunker, save the children of Goebbels, know the war and the Reich are coming to an anti-climactic but tragic end, they cling to their ideology like moths in front of a lighted bug zapper. They must have known in their heart-of-hearts that this was not going to end in their favor. However, they can't imagine life without the Reich and their Führer. He had become the acknowledged decision-maker, philosopher, and thinker for the entire country. In several scenes, the people around him acknowledge over and over again that only Hitler can make the decisions, no one else. And if they question him, or, God forbid, refuse his orders, they are labeled traitors, even in the face of impending destruction.Barely a week and a half before Hitler and Eva Braun will commit suicide, Hitler is still barking orders, arresting wayward soldiers, and sentencing perceived traitorous officers and AWOL soldiers to death, as if he is still in charge of his country, even though the allies have by now taken most of Germany, and the Russians are on the outskirts of Berlin, a few kilometers away. He rants and raves to the highest officers in his command, chastising them for not winning the war. He instructs his officers to mobilize army units in other parts of the country, even though they have all been defeated by the allies. He continues with his maps and strategies, like a chess player contemplating his next move, even though his king has been surrounded and near checkmate. However, surrender is beyond him, even at the price of more killing and destruction. The real eye-opener is not that Hitler wouldn't let go of his ideology, but those around him couldn't bring themselves to stop following his orders.In his final days and hours, according the film, Hitler never wavered from his ultimate ideology, even though the ideology itself is what led to the final demise of the Reich. His ideology for Germany was relatively simple: a national socialist government in which Hitler himself is absolute ruler without question or pause, and ethnic minorities, particularly Jews, Poles, and Gypsies have no place and must be swept aside. These ideas proved immoral and ruinous.It's not surprising that Hitler failed to see his ideology not only meant the destruction of Europe and the deaths and suffering of millions, but it also meant the near destruction of Germany itself. What is surprising is that those around him couldn't see passed Hitler's madness. During many scenes, high-ranking members of his inner circle could have refused his orders to save the German people, but they did not. They were so hypnotized by his rhetoric and ideology they had no concept to believe they could make decisions to save Germany and deny the Führer his power. Most follow him to the very end, and the price some of them pay for this loyalty is almost unimaginable. Goebbels's wife in a moving scene breaks down because she can't bear the thought of the country being without its socialist ideology and dictator.The tragedy of Germany and those most loyal to him and the Nazi cause was a blind refusal to see how their ideology was self-destructive rather than life-affirming. They believed in one leader who would do all the thinking for them and therefore they couldn't and shouldn't think for themselves. Such a tragedy that that leader happened to be Adolph Hitler. At one point, Goebbels says he has no sympathy for the country, since it was the country itself which allowed these madmen into power in the first place.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

A Happy Ending for Humanity,"Criticized at the time of its release for portraying a ""human"" Hitler, this film does no such thing - unless by ""human"" one means a raving lunatic at his absolute lowest. Based on the memoirs of Hitler's secretary, Traudl Junge, Downfall immerses the viewer in the dark, suffocating nightmare of Berlin during the last days of April 1945. The atmosphere is as bleak as one hopes Hitler's final days were - grim, claustrophobic, and devoid of even a shred of redemption.After a brief introduction by the older Traudl Junge, who makes no attempt to excuse herself for her role in history's darkest chapter, we're hurled into a hellscape: Berlin in ruins, battered day and night by Soviet bombardment. Nazi zealots still roam the streets, executing anyone they deem insufficiently patriotic. Meanwhile, children are sent to man the front lines as cannon fodder, joined by elderly men clutching rifles they can barely lift. The horror is encapsulated through the eyes of a boy desperately trying to survive the inferno.Below ground, in the bunker, Hitler and his most loyal followers remain trapped in a macabre bubble of denial. Bruno Ganz delivers a chilling performance as the detached, delusional dictator, still issuing death sentences and barking about ""traitors"" while his empire crumbles around him. Göring is condemned in absentia for daring to negotiate surrender, and poor Fegelein - Eva Braun's brother-in-law - meets his end, apparently for committing the unforgivable sin of enjoying a little debauchery amidst the apocalypse.By the time Hitler concludes that suicide is the only way out, his behavior has reached such a grotesque level of repulsiveness that any shred of pity for this ""dement demoniac"" is obliterated. The only victims who truly evoke sympathy are his dog, Blondi, and the Goebbels children - the eldest of whom almost certainly sensed their grim fate looming.As the end nears, Traudl and a small group manage to flee the bunker, walking toward the Soviet lines and an array of uncertain fates. Their escape feels oddly anticlimactic, overshadowed by the weight of the tragedy they leave behind.Downfall is a haunting, unflinching portrayal of the final collapse of the Third Reich, anchored by Bruno Ganz's mesmerizing performance and an equally exceptional supporting cast. If there's a ""happy ending"" to be found, it's the end of the monster and the demise of many of his closest accomplices - a grim but cathartic conclusion to a nightmare that finally came to an end.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Excellent,"""Der Untergang"" (2004) translated as ""Downfall"" for international market is lengthy (almost 3 hours) story about last days in Hitler's underground bunker when he was surrounded with only the most faithful followers as Berlin was being trashed and destroyed by advancing Russian army. The whole world is falling down on him, Third Reich is obviously only a dream that he can't let go,his own soldiers are completely destroyed (only soldiers left to protect Berlin are kids recruited as ""Hitler Jugend"") and even people in the bunker are only here because they have no other alternative. Yes, movie is German and based on several war memoirs of survivors who were there - historian Joachim Fest actually wrote a book ""Inside of Hitler's Bunker"" and he helped with making a script true to reality, but this is only part of the reason why the movie is such a strong experience. I have read a lot about this and all those scenes, sentences and even gestures actually happened (when disillusioned with his own generals, Hitler goes to congratulate to teenagers who are still fighting on the streets of Berlin and awkwardly grabs boy's cheek) - and than, there is acting. Director Oliver Hirschbiegel didn't just go for visual similarity though this has been achieved and can be checked with shocking results, he has calmly and objectively showed psychological turmoil these people experienced, their fears, refusals to accept the reality and nightmare that became their lives. Swiss actor Bruno Ganz is so perfect that watching him is chilling, almost scary experience - from the voice mannerisms to hand shaking to pathological switch between rage, illogical monologues, charming politeness and racist ramblings he IS the man crashing down completely. There is the whole team of excellent actors who were used to great effect even though their roles appear small - Eva Braun (Juliane Köhler) is beautiful, submissive and forcefully cheerful like she is pushing herself and everybody around to enjoy, dance and have good time (just one more cigarette) but than she sits alone in front of the mirror and in a stunning, wordless scene watches herself, gazing at the reality and death approaching. The whole Goebbels family re-creating suicide exactly as it happened, with soldiers waiting around the corner to burn their bodies. Young, naive secretary (Alexandra Maria Lara as Traudl Junge) hoping until the last moment that this is not the end and not understanding the seriousness of situation. Just watch the face of Albert Speer (brilliant actor Heino Ferch) as he listen her naive questions - he says not a word and just looks at her. These moments when characters actually don't talk, just a glance or look, it says it all.I was not surprised that movie was nominated for ""Oscar"" because it is so powerful, but I was surprised that some critics find the movie ""too sympathetic"" to Hitler - contrary to what most of the reviews so forcefully argue about, I see it not as glorification of Hitler but as a artful re-creation of true-life story and magnificent piece of psychological portrait, after all the movie does not show Hitler as a victorious or in any sense positive character, he is broken down man lost in his own illusions of grandeur and has no feeling of guilt whatsoever (he finds his war against Jews his biggest accomplishment and does not care for civilian life losses, dismissing it as unimportant - ""they have chosen us, so they deserve it"") . Brilliant, brilliant movie and I recommend it to everybody - and this is coming from somebody who usually don't care for war movies.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Amazing? Incredible,"I have a hard time calling a movie like this ""good"". While this is an incredibly gripping movie, it is very hard to watch. Of course that is not a complaint. Because of the nature of the story it must be that way. Instead I would like to describe it as profound, moving, and touching. I might even venture to describe it as horrible, but that is what makes this film so powerful. The nuance that plays out between all of those attributes makes it something special.On top of that, the acting in this movie is incredible. Everybody plays their part incredibly well with an very diverse and dynamic character line up/cast (in terms of characteristics).

Huge effort from the German people,"'Der Untergang' is not a movie like any another. It is a great film, but it however is even more than just carefully crafted historical epic. It is also Germany's brave step to face her past that has for so long been referred to with phrases like ""Nazism"" and ""the Holocaust"". Nobody but Germans could have done ""Der Untergang"" and it makes the outcome quite an extraordinary experience to watch. It's not just a war film, it's a milestone in the mind of the German people.'Der Untergang' is nothing like an easy movie to watch and it does not even tell you a new story. It only let's you to see the faces of those people who the world has condemned to hold the spectre of absolute, or at least partially absolute evil. You may think that as a rather inconvenient thing as well: you have to watch psychotic Nazis for quite a long time. You'll see detailed scenes how they will all meet their destiny and how far the reality is from these people's minds. You will realise how the evil leaders mislead their weak subjects and even if the situation is hopeless they will die because the thing they believed in is gone. It is all about commitment for things later generations have doomed, but the movie will ask ""what you would have done if you had lived in Berlin during year 1945?"".You might not necessarily like what you see, you'll realise that almost anyone of us could have been there and you can almost see yourself in the film.

"A+ Production but morally, I have my problems with this","""Nazis... I hate these guys""... Indiana JonesIn terms of production design and acting, it's flawless. Everything looked dead on real. What absolutely infuriates me though is the whitewashing it does of some of the Germans, particularly the doctor who's an SS Colonel, who's portrayed as a good guy. I'm not a historian, but everything I've ever read about the SS makes me certain that some good hearted decent guy isn't going to become an SS officer. The whole basis of the SS was totally evil. They were completely steeped in all the racist Nazi ideology, and to portray a Colonel in the SS as totally sympathetic is to me offensive.Most of the controversy I've read about has been about how Hitler was portrayed, but I didn't have a problem with that at all. I think it makes the Monster that he was all the more scary simply because he was human, as opposed to some made up Hollywood villain like Hannibal Lechter or something .It's amazing to me why one of the regular army Generals didn't just stab that guy. For years, any of them with any kind of rational mind would've had to have known that Hitler was leading the country to destruction, yet they just stood around following this guy to the end... Must be a Prussian thing.",,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

good piece of reality,"The movie tells us the last days of the life of Adolf Hitler. From the point of view of his secretary, frau Junge, we can watch how was this man, his personality, his craziness... We are able to see how are the last days of Berlin, the battle that is going to destroy the city and how different characters deal with this moment: some disobey Hitler and run for their lives, others commit suicide due to Hitler orders... The film is 2h 30m long, but you are so immersed in the story that probably you will not be able to realize that. The actors task is superb, specially Bruno Ganz (Hitler) and Ulrich (Goebbels) who play the most spectacular acting of Nazis leaders I've never seen. Touching and hearth-taking, this is one of the most hard war films ever done, as we are able to see how the city is destroyed and a country disappears (usually war films are about victories, not defeats). Unluckily, there are so many characters and so many aspects that the director wants to show that sometimes the spectator can find himself a little lost about what is happening to who. I realize that this is a hard task for the director and it does it quite well but this fact can result a little disappointing. To sum up, this is one of the best films of its year (nomination to Oscars included) and its recommended to both the ones that like good cinema or the ones that want to know about one of the darkest moments of the Humanee.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Brilliant in it's entirety. Amazing film.,"I'm a huge history buff especially WWII & the German History of the Nazi's rise to power. I've read & studied about Hitler, Goebbels, Goering & especially Albert Speer, who was the only one to say he was ""sorry"" @ the Nuremberg trials. His books that he wrote ""Inside the Third Reich & The Spandau Diaries"" are fantastic questionably true portrayals about his life who was the closest thing to that Hitler had as a friend. This film for whatever reason didn't win the Oscar for best Foreign Language Film, but it should have. I have seen this probably a dozen or so times & know the History extremely well & yet this film still has tremendous power every time I see it. The actors are Superb especially Bruno Ganz in a eerily similar manner & look of Hitler. His performance is brilliant & he captures the manic that was within that truly was shown towards the inevitable end. Even if you aren't a fan of History (which is a shame, ""those that don't learn from history, are doomed to repeat it"", great quote can't remember who said it) this is still a great film in of it self. It doesn't matter if you know the story or not because you will be fully engrossed once you start watching this superbly done film. I wouldn't have been able to appreciate this as much when I was younger *cough* teenager, like I can now, but if you miss out on this film It will be a shame. The fact that most of this film %%80-%90 percent of it is probably true too. This was extensively researched by those involved & the commentary by the director is extremely informative and interesting as well. By far one of the best commentaries I ever heard. He rarely stops talking (in a good way) & always has something interesting to say about the making of the film, the characters, & the basic true stories of those he profiles. A great film in every way which everyone should see. I'm a pretty tough critic so feel free to check my other comments to see where I stand. I don't give 10's very often maybe 1/500 films I see is a 10, so that is saying something, but don't take it from me, figure it out for yourself.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
A gripping biopic of history's greatest monster,"Oliver Hirschbiegel's Downfall plays like a solemn, mournful dirge as it chronicles the last days of Hitler's Germany, as seen by his personal stenographer, Traudl Jung (Alexandria Maria Lara.) It is a tale of a city's death, and the fate of those whose actions were responsible for it. It is above all, an unflinching portrait of one of the most reprehensible people in history, yet one that never allows itself to forget that even he was human.After brief interview footage with Frau Jung, and a scene showing her first meeting with Hitler, the story moves to Berlin, April 1945. The Third Reich, which was to last a thousand years, is in full collapse. Russian artillery pounds the city from positions only a few miles away. The people know that the end is approaching, and pray only that they will survive it.Below the streets, deep inside the Furherbunker, many have come to the same conclusions. The top generals realize that they can only delay the inevitable for so long. Himmler, Goering, and the other Nazi bigwigs who for years trumpeted their loyalty to the ideals of National Socialism can hardly wait to flee. And in the center of it all is the Furhur himself.Bruno Ganz' portrayal of Hitler is absolutely brilliant. Here is a man who once ruled all Europe from the English Channel to the outskirts of Moscow. Now he is confined to his bunker as his empire dies. He is haggard and high strung from lack of sleep and a steady stream of bad news. His mood swings wildly with each new development. At times he remains convinced that final victory is at hand, that all will be saved as soon as this thrust or that breaks through the encircling Russians. He discusses his plans for a new, rebuilt Berlin with Marshal Speer and tells the new Luftwaffe commandeer that he has thousands of jet fighters ready to take to the skies.But when he hears that the planned counterattack has failed, his rage is terrible to behold as he lashes out at his generals. He rants and raves about their cowardice and disloyalty, until exhausted, he falls into despair, declaring that all is lost. This cycle is repeated multiple times; with Hitler believing that one nonexistent force or another will safe him, then ranting against his enemies, both real and imagined, then settling into melancholy as he comes to terms with- and plans- his own death.Through all of this, Ganz is entirely convincing, capturing both his madness and his humanness. When he gets angry, his face reddens and the veins in his forehead bulge. He looks, and sounds, just like Hitler did at the Nuremburg rallies. When he loses touch and talks about his grandiose plans, he speaks with such earnestness that those around him can only nod in agreement. When he talks of the Jews and the Russians, his voice goes cold, his eyes narrow, and everything human leaves his face.And those around him must also come to grips with the reality of their situation. Some take an attitude of ""Eat, drink and be merry, for tomorrow we die."" His mistress, Eva Braun, even holds a party on the surface, until it is broken up by artillery fire. Others cling to faith in final victory, refusing to believe that Germany can lose, until even they can no longer deny it. Some reach a calm fatalism, accepting that their end has come. Still others, like Frau Jung, realize that their only hope is to escape.The end, when it finally comes is swift. After Hitler's suicide, it is left only for the remaining occupants to either follow suit or flee for their lives, hoping to make it through the enemy lines, as the city burns and the last remaining die-hards make their final stands. Watching this unfold, the characters' fear and anguish are palpable, as is the sheer pointlessness of their struggle. And yet Downfall manages to fully convey the hopelessness, despair, and chaos without giving in to them. This is perhaps the movie's greatest strength. Although it draws you into a bunker mentality, and does not flinch from showing the chaos desolation of the Reich's last days, in the end, you are reminded that somehow, life goes on.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
"I want to like it, but it's just boring.","I am a huge fan of history of Hitler, yes, he was evil, but just because he done dozens of evil things, doesn't mean he didn't do anything good and that's what many people ignore to see. He promoted a healthy life, he didn't smoke, he was an animal lover, he was a vegetarian, he wrote some interesting books, he promoted science, if Hitler would've won ww2 we may have a much better technology today.As for the movie itself, it shows the last moments of hitler's life. I love that they didn't show what happened the last minuted as in the history books, we can't know for sure, because nobody saw it. I love how well they portrayed Hitler, they showed clues of parkinson.

Incredible performance,"Bruno Ganz not only had the courage to take on the role of Hitler, but also turned him into a human being. This is what makes this performance absolutely stunning. Hitler the Demon can me neglected, but a human Hitler cannot. It means that you and I can also turn into a Hitler and that is so mich more frightening than any otherworldly being will ever be.

Unshakeable Loyalty,"A striking aspect of this highly accurate portrayal of Hitler's last days was the unshakable loyalty displayed by many Germans even at the darkest hour when the end was clear. We must remember that Hitler was enormously popular up until the invasion of Poland. His personal popularity remained high throughout the war years despite his increasingly despotic rule. It is a warning to us today just how easy it is for a cultured population to strongly support amoral leaders who pander to fear and a twisted sense of morality. Although it was not visible in the film, the motto cast on every German army belt buckle was ""Gott Mit Uns"" - God is with us! Today our subhumans are not ""Bolshevik Jews"" but ""terrorists"".",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
"Powetful Drama that Captures the Tension Immensely,","Downfall is a great movie with a very well developed plot and an outstanding cast. It is a very dark, surreal and blunt drama that really dives deep in to the final days of World War II. It does not hold back on the intensity of these times, the dialogue is suspenseful and we are at the edge of our seat throughout, feeling any of these characters could be killed off in any moment.It can be a bit too ""big"" at times in terms of performances, not that any of the acting is poor, just a bit too theatrical at times for a film. There are moments, particularly in Hitler's office scenes, that are somewhat Shakespearean, that would have made more sense on stage, it could have been subtler.The film makes a very controversial decision of humanising Adolf Hitler, portraying a lot of the traumas of this war from his perspective. Though I did not leave this film thinking Hitler is a good person, I did feel for his characters in levels that really surprised me, thanks mainly to a stellar, enticing performance from Bruno Ganz.It is two and a half hours long, but it does not feel like that. Intense and very well acted, Downfall had me enthralled throughout, worth the watch if you are looking for a good drama.Conveys the final days of the second World War through the point of view of Hitler's secretary.Best Performance: Bruno Ganz",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
One of the most powerful war films of the decade,"Despite the context of the politics (of which I mean; they were Nazis), set amongst the bleak contrasts of the intentions it remains so emotionally draining I was on the edge of tears. It's so haunting yet never feels manipulative. Bruno Ganz is a brute force not to be reckoned with, and I hate not giving him the win but Giamatti is most triumphant. Somehow he managed to add a grand depth to Hitler, especially in his passive moments of deep thought - completely humanizing his 'character'. Entwined with the scenes of Hitler are war scenes, yet unglorified sections of one nearby area being attacked. So gritty yet stark makes for exhilarating viewing; outstanding cinematography and sound. It had perfect pacing, matching the subtext of events to make it more affecting, which was extremely effective despite not always being so subtle. I thought it was a wise choice to not make Hitler's suicide anything special over the other suicides, which were often more shocking. Watching the men re-evaluate their last thoughts was tremendous. The last image was beautiful, if contrived; showing us a last glimpse of hope for the truly innocent.8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Best Hitler Movie Ever,"I saw this movie on DVD, forgetting all the hoopla over the premier of a movie that ""humanized"" Hitler. It did precisely that: it humanized a monster because he was really human and it showed him for the ugly, little cruel man he was. That he was kind to his help and his dog weighs light in his balance against his mass murder and all out war. Bruno Ganz blew away all those pompous Brits who normally star in those Hitler-in-the-Berlin-bunker sort of movie. He was awesome, almost real. The scenes above ground in bomb/shell/bullet ravaged Berlin are like Dutch master portraits of hell. Here, we see Berlin in her death agony at the end of the greatest war. Now it's the Zero Hour, Stunde Null, in Berlin in all the horror and absurdity. Ironically, they used the ultimate WW ll victim city as for location, St. Petersburg or Leningrad. It captures the feeling of one of the most horrific battles in modern history, in small, block by block scenes of small scale horror. The most horrible scene however, occurred in the bunker, as ugly Frau and Herr Goebbels poison their five children to death, before doing the world a favor by killing each other.The movie is based on Traudl Junge's story, a pretty young steno/secretary of Hitler, and what she saw in those horrible last days. She was a teenager from Bavaria who was hired to be Hitler's steno in 1942, when the war seemed distant and going well, and lived in his court from then on. She adored Hitler like a teeny bopper going nuts over some rock star. But in the end, with the horror swirling around her and her idol ranting about killing even the German people and all his entourage off as the climax to his 1000 Year Reich, she reconsiders him a bit. Eva Braun was portrayed as some sort of party animal, drinking and dancing in a house as the Russians shelled it. and telling Traudl how much she hated Hitler's German shepherd Biondi. It is all fact based so anyone familiar with history knows the plot. Bravo for making such an ugly and real movie!",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Needs to be scarier to teach that crucial lesson,"The Germans in this Nazi movie are not nearly realistic enough. German Nazis look EXTREMELY scary. The movie ""Russian Fury"" on YouTube gets closer. Germans are animals underneath. Always have been, and are to this day. And now the reason for that scare: Germans instinctively try to imitate other neighbours, such as the Dutch (first choice), Brits and Russians. The facial movements are the same as those of Dutch, Brits and Russians, then. Except Germans are still animals underneath. Sociopaths. If you socialize with a disguised German, you keep expecting empathy but you never see any empathy. Rotten meat tastes bad. Right ? Well. No reason not to eat it. It's probably war or something. Expect the expected, when you think you are meeting normal people in Germany. They are really not even people. And that's incredibly scary. And that's what Nazi movies need to teach. Now, get an animal to play an animal disguised as a human. Complicated, I would say.",5.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Brings the history appallingly alive,"This movie is not for the kids. It doesn't pull any punches as it provides an accurate and detailed look at the final days of Hitler in Berlin. The cast is a powerful one, with key historical figures recreated in great detail from the meticulous accounts of survivors and the writings of those who died in the fall of Berlin. The acting is superb, with the complex mix of emotions the people (I can't call them ""characters"" since they were all real people) conveyed very well. You can feel the hopelessness, the sense of loss, the fear, the courage, the fanaticism and the madness the movie is trying to convey. By the end, I finally realized my jaw was hanging open, though I can not honesty say how long it was that way.

Gotterdammerung : the Reich on the pyre,"Adolph Hitler has accumulated more film reals than even the worst of his rivals. We can ask which is your favourite Hitler movie? We could not say the same for FDR, Churchill or Hitler's equally brutal nemeses the dictator Joseph Stallin.This version carefully tracks the Historical accounts rendered by reputable historians Trevor-Roper and John Toland. And we have two prior films specifically dealing with Hitler's demise and the collapse of the Reich: Last Days and The Bunker which follow the same general line. However some in recent years have questioned whether this account is correct.Some say the account given us is far too heroic, a tale shaped into a Wagnerian epic. I suppose we'll never know what really occurred in the Bunker but the performance of Bruno Gantz as Hitler was grand eloquent. I'm sorry I know only a smattering of Deutch insufficient to follow the dialogue without sub-titles but Ganz does not read lines they echo off his face. One needs no sub-titles when he acts.None of the versions of the Untergang (literally Going Under) talk of Hitler's double, found by the Russians stuffed in a chimney in the Reich Chancellery Garden.

The film ends with video footage of the real Traudl Junge talking about her feelings towards the war and he involvement with the Nazis.

A superb movie,"I first saw this at the movies and was completely bowled over by it. The story is familiar enough to anyone who's been conscious at any time in the last 60 years. The story is sordid (about Hitler, Goebbels etc) and tragic(for Germany) with it. Junge's own contribution at the start of the film is very telling. Ganz's portrayal of an avuncular Hitler one minute and a raving delusional the next is a standout performance. The mood of the film is claustrophobic in the extreme, no doubt reflecting how oppressive that time in the bunker must have been for all concerned and the switches to what was happening above ground highlight the whole unreality of the bunker existence. I've since bought the DVD and have watched it again 3 times since. Ganz doesn't look much like Hitler(always excepting the moustache) but after a minute or two it doesn't matter. It makes me wish for an equally good film about Stalin- a subject crying out for screen work.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
A Haunting and Intimate Portrait of Hitler's Final Days,"Downfall is a powerful and gripping portrayal of the final days of Adolf Hitler's reign during World War II. Directed by Oliver Hirschbiegel, the film offers an intimate and harrowing glimpse into the claustrophobic bunker where Hitler and his closest associates await the inevitable downfall of the Third Reich.One of the film's greatest strengths lies in its meticulous attention to historical detail and its commitment to authenticity. From the meticulously recreated sets to the nuanced performances of the cast, Downfall immerses viewers in the chaotic and surreal atmosphere of Hitler's crumbling regime. Bruno Ganz delivers a mesmerizing performance as Adolf Hitler, capturing both the dictator's charisma and his descent into madness with haunting precision.Beyond its historical significance, Downfall is a profoundly human story that explores themes of power, loyalty and moral responsibility. Through the perspectives of various characters, including Hitler's secretary Traudl Junge and the loyal but disillusioned Eva Braun, the film offers a complex and multifaceted portrayal of individuals grappling with the moral complexities of their choices in the face of tyranny.The film's unflinching depiction of the horrors of war and the moral ambiguity of its characters makes it a deeply thought-provoking and emotionally resonant viewing experience. Downfall is not simply a historical drama, but a poignant meditation on the darkest depths of human nature and the consequences of unchecked power.In addition to its powerful storytelling and exceptional performances, Downfall is also a technical marvel, with masterful cinematography, editing and sound design that heighten the tension and intensity of the narrative.Overall, Downfall is a cinematic tour de force that deserves its reputation as one of the most compelling and essential films about World War II. It is a testament to the enduring power of cinema to illuminate the complexities of history and to provoke reflection and discussion long after the credits roll.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

The last days of the Third Reich and Bruno Ganz,"On February 16, 2019 died the famous Swiss actor Bruno Ganz and many of us will remember always his brilliant performance of Bruno Ganz.
Der Untergang is one of the few films in which the character of Adolf Hitler is largely described and is also the principal character of the film.
This film is based on the testimony of Traudl Junge who was the last secretary of Adolf Hitler and shows us Adolf Hitler, at the same time enthusiast and also totally depressed.

It drags but some of that is our sense of the inevitable,"It's a very well executed if at times tedious film, a snapshot of life within Nazi journey at a time which is seldom depicted so dispassionately behind the camera...and by that I mean, the characters are allowed to merely live and breathe on the screen, and little (visible) effort is made to overlay any moral overtones or message. Perhaps the director wisely understands that no one really walks into a Hitler film without a mountain of context and historical understanding of the inevitability of the conclusion. And yet, as one watches these individuals in their lifelike realism--less monster, more unfortunate, lost human--one wonders if this all was so inevitable after all if only better men and women could have risen at the right times instead of Hitler. But that's not the ultimate focus of this movie.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
"A brave, bold movie","While there may be a multitude of movies produced in Europe and America depicting the atrocities of Adolf Hitler and the Third Reich - both to dramatic and deliberately comical effect - Germany itself is notoriously apprehensive when facing its dark, and very recent, history. Based on accounts from historians and witnesses, including Andre Heller and Othmar Schmiderer's documentary Blind Spot: Hitler's Secretary (from which scenes are used to book-end the film), Oliver Hirschbiegel's Der Untergang, or Downfall, is one of the best movies ever made about Hitler. Rather than investigating how the war veteran and struggling artist became the egotistical tyrant he is remembered as being, Downfall focuses on his final days holed up in a bunker as the war comes to a bloody end around him.It's a testament to Bruno Ganz's performance that Hitler remains the enigmatic figure seen in Leni Riefenstahl's documentaries, even though he is descending into madness and is clearly in the early stages of Alzheimer's disease. As the Russian army closes in on Berlin and the shell blasts increase in volume through the walls, Hitler and his cabinet are faced with the crippling realisation that their vision of global ethnic cleansing and forming a Germanic empire has failed spectacularly. Often hushed, cunning and inspirational to the men who still adore him, the Fuhrer is also prone to outrageous demands and formidable tantrums. He is a paradoxical cluster, damning his people to death by demanding they still resist an enemy that has already defeated them, yet Ganz still finds humanity in there. Between scolding the Jewish race and sending units into certain death, he mourns the death of his beloved dog Blondi and forms a tender relationship with Eva Braun (Juliane Kohler). He is humanised, but never sympathetic.Yet Downfall is not simply a document of Hitler's final days; it is much more about Germany as a whole, and how the country fell into chaos as the Reich was toppled. We gain access into the bunker through Traudl Junge (Alexandra Maria Lara), Hitler's secretary for many years. Out in the increasingly perilous streets of Berlin, Professor Schenck (Christian Berkel) does all he can to help the weak and injured while Hitler Youth assassinate old men fleeing the bombing. Many of the cabinet, including Albert Speer (Heino Ferch) and Hermann Fegelein (Thomas Kretschmann), are desperate to flee and urge their Fuhrer to do the same, while contradicting his orders in the hope of salvaging some sort of peace. Despite the scope of the story, you'll never hear Downfall being referred to as an ensemble piece or a war epic, as it retains a sense of intimacy throughout thanks to Rainer Klaussman's grainy, claustrophobic cinematography, with even the wide-open streets of Berlin feeling oddly suffocating. It's a brave, bold movie, and one that goes about its business with focus and a stern grip on the complex unfolding of events.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Good film witch gives you an inside in the mind of Hitler.,"I was amazed when i saw the movie. It really grabbed me but not only when i watched the movie especially when you think of the way of thinking of the Nazi's.Der Untergang got a lot of criticism on the continent about putting Hitler down as an person. But in fact he was, many people don't want to hear that. But Hitler was a person who had a great talent for organizing stuff and people. It's hard to think in our western civilization today that the crazy idea's of 1 man would be followed so dedicated by people who know better, just because they had spoken a oath to serve the ruler of Germany.Even in the last day's when Hitler orders the German people to their deaths there are not all lot off people who do not listen.

Bravo,"""Downfall"" takes you into Hitler's bunker during the fall of the third Reich and the last ten days of the battle for Berlin. This historical docudrama spends its time examining one of history's most enigmatic and inscrutable dictators as he descend into paranoia to the bewilderment of his inner circle and, in particular, one young woman stenographer who, in real life, survived the war and published her memoirs providing one of the few historical records of that time and place. The film is well done as a stand alone dramatic presentation. However, it excels as an historical drama by providing insights into Hitler's last days; something never dealt with in such detail before in film.

There's no escape from Downfall,"I have seen lots of documentaries about world War two and also am so enthusiastic about the events of it, so for this time I was looking for a movie to be enthralled by, but when I finished watching Downfall, I didn't feel that enthrallment in me. Downfall is about the last ten days of Adolf Hitler In berlin. I think this failure of the movie to entertain me was mostly because of the way which story goes.When a director wants to touch such an important event of history, and going into a rather personal life of Hitler, he must be a little more cautious with actings, stroy and most importantly history itself, and I don't think that Oliver Hirschbiegel had paid enough Homage to such an important event.But one and maybe the only good point about the movie is a depiction of the moral breakdown of German people and mostly the high ranked officers in the last final days of SS.",5.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
The best World War 2 epic ever?,"Let me echo others in saying I know no greater film about World War 2. DOWNFALL is so brilliantly conceived, so perfectly written and acted, and so uncompromisingly probing and honest, it makes SAVING PRIVATE RYAN look adolescent by comparison.It's miraculous how DOWNFALL avoids the easy answers and typical agendas one finds in books and films about this period, opting to show all sides of one of history's most dramatic and troubling episodes. The bloodiest war in human history is grinding to a close, and YOU ARE THERE. Modern parallels abound ... something very much like this probably happened in Iraq, as Saddam held on till the bitter end.The film's use of violence is truly commendable -- there is exactly enough to grip and shock us, where appropriate, but never the gratuitous gore-for-its-own sake that one finds even in Spielberg's battle scenes.DOWNFALL recalls Woodrow Wilson's reaction to Griffith's BIRTH OF A NATION: ""it's like writing history with lightning."" The writing and the acting, especially Bruno Ganz's towering, fully-dimensional portrait of Hitler, should win every award there is. Previous film Hitlers have been paper tigers, melodramatic villains, but Ganz gives us a complex, living, breathing human being -- which makes him all the more frightening.Bravo to everyone who had a hand in producing this masterpiece!",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Awesome psychological analysis of Hitler and his generals /  close women,"Very good movie. I saw a lot of movies of 2nd WW, and this is one of the greatest, although there are nearly no scenes of combat.It provides you a very good insight of what can be the last month of a war in a Headquarter (95% of the movie is inside a bunker). The movie is very psychological, you never are bored, although everybody knows how it finishes.I was much impressed by the actor that plays Hitler, showing this person as a bit ""schizophrenic"": he changes his mind from despair to great hope although most generals know how it will finish.You really feel yourself as one of the generals and thinking ""What should I say to this crazy Hitler now ? If I tell the truth he will become mad and if I lie saying everything goes alright, I and my family will be killed""You see also the complete fanatic Nazis and SS that take Hitler like their god (Goebbels, his wife, the SS officers...)You feel the cruelty and absence of mercy of Hitler, although he sometimes shows some humanity and gentleness to women and to the fidel generals. ""If I die, all Germans deserve to die too"" - ""all the strong Aryans are dead in combat, so all the weak (remaining civilians in Berlin) should die too""The play of the actresses (Eva Braun, the secretary, the wife of Goebbels) is impressive too.Brrrrrr, what a terrible guy Hitler (and the SS) were.Did you know that all future SS soldiers received a dog for their 14 year old and had to kill the dog when they were 16 ! After that, you understand what kind of inhumane beings you can create with some machiavelic methods on young people.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
a stunning experience to see people so human and therefore so monstruous,"Pure history. 100% correct if the masterpiece ""Hitler"" from Ian Kershaw sets the standard. Facts, atmosphere, especially the human dimensions of the key figures, the Austrian charm of Hitler for example, makes them more understandable - en therefore extremely more monstruous.The constant switching scenes between the war, havoc and suffering in Berlin and the relative tranquility in the bunker, disrupted by the outbreaks of Hitler, kept me on full alert for almost three hours.I never could understand that a woman like Magda Goebbels could kill her own six children. After this movie, I still can't but I *can* grasp some of the impact that Hitler must have had on his entourage. Chilling.A must see; the first time I was in a movie where literally *nobody* left the cinema when the credits rolled - stunned by the experience.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Perhaps the best movie I've Ever seen,"I'm compelled to pass my comments along! THIS MOVIE IS ABSOLUTELY A MASTERPIECE! I don't ever remember seeing a movie with subtitles and thinking it was on par with movies that I don't have to read through -- but this movie has broken that mold.I honestly forgot about the subtitles all together. I was so riveted to the screen that I forgot all about them.I also cannot believe that I have a sense that it was perhaps the best acting I've ever seen! And I don't even know German! There were no lulls or downers in this movie at all. I looked forward to EVERY scene and every thread of the story. The effects were amazing and I was left with the impression that painstaking attention was paid to reflect actual events.One very slight caution: If you are going to see this movie and you don't know anything about World War 2 or Hitler then you might be a little confused. The movie ""skips over"" much of the war to focus on the last days of Berlin. There is a rich representation of the personalities but if you don't know your history you might not catch all of the nuances. The movie picks up on a war ""well underway"".NOTE: This is NOT a negative at all in my opinion. It simply is a slice of the war carried out in a brilliant way.DO NOT WALK -- RUN to go see this movie now! It's great in a theater with a large screen.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
"""Der Untergang"" - maybe the best German movie about their darkest chapter","This morning I had the opportunity of seeing ""Der Untergang"" in a press preview. ""Der Untergang"" gives us an inside look of the last days of Adolf Hitler and his surrounding staff in the ""Führerbunker"" in Berlin.The story is told through the eyes of his 22-years-old secretary Traudl Junge who was like many other Germans fascinated by their leader. The Swiss actor Bruno Ganz gives a very impressive performance as Hitler, he succeeds in showing us the ""normal"" man and not only the evil monster.But the movie not just focuses on this one man, it makes very clear that Hitler was supported by many other important men and women.Most part of the dialog is authentic, the atmosphere in the bunker is very realistic, almost claustrophobic ( like in Petersons ""Das Boot"" ).The permanent sound of the exploding bombs, that indicate the arriving of the Russian Army, gives the viewer a feeling of being him/ herself inside the bunker. But the main achievement of the movie is that it reflects the microcosmo of different characters of the Third Reich, all impressive played by the leading German actors. The script gives us no main characters we could identify with. ""Der Untergang"" is maybe the best German movie about their darkest chapter of History.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

An amazing movie,This movie really depicted the utter destruction Germany went through under Hitler. It showed how Hitlers madness lead him to the deaths of millions and the people of Germany paid for it. Its amazing the Germany has recovered from the effects of the war but still the wounds of history remain. The acting was superb in the movie especially Bruno Ganz who plays Hitler was awesome he deserves all the praise. The suffering the people went through at that time i cannot even imagine thank god i was not alive in 1945. The movie starts in 1945 and Hitler chooses an assistant. The movie gave me the impression that Hitler was mentally ill leading him to commit crimes against humanity which the German people had to pay for his doings. Overall a magnificent German movie and A MUST SEE by every German/German speaker and movie-goer one of the best war time movies ever and the reviews say that!,9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
One of those movies that can't be missed,"Of the many World War II movies, this one is the best you will ever see. Now I am not a big fan of movies that I have to read subtitles for the fact that it takes a little out of the movie for me. Bruno Ganz who played Adolf Hitler had a spectacular performance. Every scene he was in you felt like you were in the room as well. If he is shouting, you are frightened, if he is joyous, you are rejoicing with him. Untergang, Der shows the other side of the war that most movies will leave out. As the movie goes you feel like it is your duty to watch it. There is no downside on any level through out the movie and the further a long it goes the more and more it builds even if it is not meant to. Now a two and a half hour movie may sound like a long time to spend watching a movie but I can guarantee that you won't be disappointed. There are some movies that should be their hour and a half but there are others that need to be the long length they are so you as the viewer will get the movie, live in the movie, and love it.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Being young is no excuse...... (Traudl Junge),"Every time during the past decades when we (Germans) got confronted with our past it came down to excuses like it was a different time, different mentality, different political environment. But I believe this movie has finally changed some serious aspects of these confrontations. I don't believe the movie is an admittance of responsibility; it is a display of reality and facts during this dark period of German history.Still today, generations later, we get punished for our history and there is no denying it; BBC2 for example still allows some of its moderators to display an uncalled for sarcasm and I don't think any German citizen will find this ""funny"".The movie is an outstanding piece of historical accuracy and displays the typical mindset of the Nazi Party and their leaders. Military recommendations that could still have saved thousands of Soldiers and civilians have been over-turned single handed by a man that had no regard for human life.The interview with Bruno Ganz (playing Hitler) on DVD shows clearly the conflicts and reservations that most of the actors had. Bruno asked the question: ""How can I display a man that is responsible for killing millions of people?"" Only through great personal strength and psychological intense preparation was he able to pull it off. We need to understand that he is not just playing a bad guy in some fictional Bond movie; this was a real as it gets and he and the entire cast deserve the highest respect for not slipping up into the ""lesser evil"".I am by all means no film critic but I know how my fellow country men felt over the past decades when confronted with German history during the Nazi period. So my hopes and wishes go out to people who are watching this must see movie with the result to closely observe a truthful piece of never forgotten German history - and perhaps draw some conclusions when applying judgment to anyone, not just the Germans.One of the great messages of this movie is the display of psychological manipulation, so always be aware; it happened in the past and could happen again. Some people might disagree with that statement but just take a look in the mirror and consider the objectives in your life, and what would you be willing to do to achieve that? The Nazis where (bad) humans with a motive and the means to achieve their objectives. But so was Stalin and the communists and so is Osama Bin Laden......do I need to continue?I give this movie a 10 for the acting and the political accuracy and I'm sure it will find a place in some school history lessons. If newer generations take valid lessons from this movie then it achieved at least one goal - it will make them think for themselves....and not just follow an idea with blind folds.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Bruno Ganz is the Devil incarnate,"I had to click back to 2005 to remind myself who was nominated for Best actor. Clint got the nod that year but Bruno Ganz's omission is somewhat of a head scratcher. Suffice to say, Ganz and Downfall transcends the 'foreign film category' in which it was designated. Such is Ganz's portrayal that it's easy to believe-and not a little unnerving to sense that, along with the assembled cast, you are also subject to the rantings of a deranged psychotic dictator. The cast, by the way, are phenomenal and Oliver Hirschbiegel's retelling of Traudle Junge's first hand experience is nothing less than a tour de force.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Chilling and Essential,"I think every person on earth should be required to view this film. I can think of no other film that does as good of job of relaying the horrors of war and in particular, the tragedy that the Nazis brought upon Germany. Certainly nobody could dare to profess an admiration for Hitler after seeing what he did to Germany. This film helps relate those last few days as Nazi leaders cower in their bunker and bark orders to other Germans on the outside to keep fighting and dying. Moreover, when we are forced to view the deaths of the six Goebbels children, well, it is almost too much. The performances and the writing are just top notch. I don't think I have ever seen a movie so realistic in details and this is of course because the movie is based on the testimony of Germans that were actually there experiencing this as it happened.

A breathtaking historical experience...,"The story of the people living in Hitlers bunker during the last days of World War II, told through the eyes of his secretary.This is a real war movie. It has not been made to entertain such as a movie such as Saving Private Ryan or Black Hawk Down. This is the cinematic biography of Adolf Hitler and his men. It explains what happens in the last days of his bunker and shows the point of view that the Nazi's held. Because this is a German film, the movie is subtitled, but this takes away nothing from its greatness. This is just a great film. The man who plays Adolf Hitler(Bruno Ganz) played him so well that it feels as if you were actually watching Hitler himself. Ganz played the role perfectly and was the major reason for the movie's greatness. Although this story seems as though it wouldn't be very interesting, it is surprisingly entertaining just by the excessive detail. It is almost as if it is a horror film in some scenes. It shows brutal suicides, murders, and even killings of children. Reminding me mainly of Schindler's List, this movie holds a certain dramatic effect that makes war movies so great. Overall, the movie was great in every aspect but is not for a person with a weak stomach.I highly recommend this film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Riveting!,"I just grabbed this one at the video store not realizing it was subtitled which at first threw me off but once I got into it the film is very, very good. The cinematography is excellent. A few of the scenes looked almost identical to those in The Pianist, another great movie. Bruno Ganz is outstanding as Hitler; I keep wondering where I've seen Ganz before. Needless to say he confirmed my thoughts that Der Fuhrer was a complete nut job! It's a wonder he didn't have a stroke every five minutes. I am always amazed that the Nazis were so fanatically loyal to the point of killing off their children rather than surrender. And although I can hardly compare Hitler to our own President George W. Bush, we do have those in our country who seem to support him no matter what. I especially like Thomas Kretchmann who seems to bring something new to every Nazi he plays (as in The Pianist). The battle scenes are fantastic too; just trying to imagine the director setting up such wonderful shots is enough to warrant a second look. I got a little chuckle seeing Hitler eat ravioli like it was the last thing on earth and they always seemed to have plenty of booze too. I won't get philosophical about the film; much has been written etc. about the Holocost and all that. I have the movie for 5 days so I think I'll watch it again.

"Engrossing, Effectively Told Story From Another Point of View","This film depicts the lives of several infamous and lesser known Germans in the final days of Adolf Hitler, as the Russians took Berlin, leading up to the victory of the Allied Forces in World War II. It is told through the eyes of one of Hitler's final secretaries. As well as detailing her experiences, it also closely follows the story of a doctor, a young boy and Hitler himself. What is unique about this film compared with most World War II-related movies, is that it tells a story from the perspective of the ""enemy."" In addition, it's also unusual in that it is neither condemning nor condoning of the events that take place. It non-judgmentally observes the events as they unfold. As defeat becomes more evident, each character finds his or her own rationalization to cope with the reality. Some steadfastly cling to their National-Socialist beliefs while others watch as their leader begins to spiral downward into mental delusion and his Parkinson's Disease grows increasingly more severe. The strength of this film's story and production values place it on par as a comparable companion piece to Steven Spielberg's ""Schindler's List"" and ""Saving Private Ryan.""",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Excellent,"Excellent film. It shows how loyal the Germans were to Hitler. It also shows a more passionate Hitler. He is more human then ever portrayed before. How delusional he was and how in the end the more sane and ruthless of his gang betrayed him. One minor point is the actor playing dr Goebbels. He should have been more charismatic. He was a manipulator of people, not a tyrant. But it is only a minor mistake. I found it rather weird that the personal secretary of Hitler didn't know about the concentration camps.

The Soviets are closing in and shelling the center of the city. Traudl is still working for Hitler in his bunker. Children are manning the guns. Hitler is giving unrealistic orders to undermanned overwhelmed units. It's the last days of the Third Reich.This is a compelling telling of the last days of Hitler. He's a feared mad man, delusional, and a human being. It also has other characters inside and outside of the bunker. There are battles but they're not done for excitement.

Downfall of Hitler!!

Maria Lara as Hitler's secretary too is very well depicted role and the story is from her point the way she sees Hitler in his final days. Acting from others too is very good, direction is excellent, music score is good, and camera work too is top notch. I didn't understand how to react to this movie after first viewing, should I be sympathetic to the characters or should I be happy for the end, as WWII and atrocities of Hitler is the worst in the history as far as my knowledge goes, but I will say this that I was stunned by the movie 100%. It is that good. The effort by the team of this movie must be applauded for there amazing work and bringing history closer to us in the movie in a best form possible.

Captivating with stunning performances and a powerful underlying message,"This is a dramatized account of Hitler's final days in his bunker at the end of World War II. The story is told partly through the eyes of his most fervent supporters as well as his last secretary, Traudl Junge. Downfall is a cinematic triumph that has the potential to be completely misunderstood, but it seems most critics and viewers are grasping it. The filmmakers assume the audience is familiar with the history of the Holocaust, and focuses solely on Hitler and his interactions with his loyal supporters and family at the end of his reign. The story is a bit uneven and has trouble deciding whether it's Hitler's narrative or Jungle's narrative. But ultimately, it is a character study of Hitler in his final days--a man who wanted to retain his power so badly that he wanted to sacrifice the German civilians that he claimed to be saving. It is also a portrait of a group of people who are so unquestionably zealous in their beliefs and how they react to the destruction of their power. The performances are haunting and emotional, especially by Bruno Ganz (Hitler), Alexandra Maria Lara (Traudl Junge), and Juliane Kohler (Eva Braun). Some might think this is an insensitive film or ""sympathetic"" to Hitler, but this is not how I saw it. This is an important film and exactly what the world needs right now. Hitler wasn't a monster that should be seen as an anomaly in the human race. He was a human being capable of monstrosities. There are plenty of people today with political power that are committing monstrosities and they shouldn't be followed blindly.My Rating: 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

Eminently worth seeing.,"Enough has been written about Adolph Hitler, but not enough for the screen. There need be no more after you see ""The Downfall"" grimly presenting the Fuhrer's last days of his life in 1945 in his bunker. Bruno Ganz is the definitive Hitler: morose, fitful, tender, murderous, and demented. Ganz not only looks like Hitler, but he also inhabits his character with passion and possibly an understanding of his premiere place in the halls of historical hooligans. (The chance that Ganz does too close an interpretation is possible for the purists.) Ganz is able at the same time to flesh out some charm and warmth without a measure of sympathy for a certifiable despot. The scene where her hires his secretary (the only one not in the bunker area), Traudl Junge (Alexandra Maria Lara), has a tenderness uncharacteristic of the public tyrant. This screenplay depends partly on that secretary's memoirs.Screenwriter Bernd Eichinger provides the dialog that reveals the madness; for example: ""If the war is lost, it is immaterial if the German people survive. I will shed not one tear for them."" Eichinger adds insights about the willingness of the German people to be led by Hitler, who worked their racism and Xenophobia into a scheme of world domination only to have the world unify against them.Director Oliver Hirschbiegel guides a stunningly believable scene showing the horrible obedience to Hitler that allowed the Goebbels parents to poison their children rather than live in a ""world without National Socialism."" Magda Goebbels goes beyond Medea when she transforms her six children into corpses with a deft movement too macabre to be described in words. The softness of the children and the cool of Magda's tormented act are more than the luck of good acting; they depend on a perfect mise en scene only a director can create.Escaping Hitler but not banality, Heinrich Himmler wonders, ""When I meet Churchill, should I give the Nazi salute, or shake his hand?"" Equally clueless but not without insight about the madman's character is Eva Braun, Hitler's new wife, when she says to his secretary, ""He only talks about dogs and vegetarian meals. He doesn't want anyone to see deep inside of him."" Nominated for best foreign language film of 2004 The Downfall takes us deep inside the bunker and partially into the depth of Hitler. It's not pretty there, but it is eminently worth seeing.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Commanding attention through all revulsion.,"I admit I wasn't thrilled by the first half of the movie, as I was a bit confused by whom all Hitler's Generals were - but as soon as I identified Himmler and Goebbles, I was okay. Besides that, I loved it, as far as one can love such a harrowing film.I've heard people say that this movie put Hitler in too soft a light, which is not the case. It just focuses on other points than on the side of him most of us know, but it's not ignoring the awful things he did. That being said, this is a film about the last 12 days, not really about all his evilness and the horrible things he did.This movie features a brilliant cast, very intense and believable. Such a cast is needed to pull off such a film. Even if one can't identify with some roles, they are all captivating. Some of the best (or worst) scenes were all without any dialogue at all. All in all, I recommend this movie to anyone who isn't left cold by the idea of the Holocaust.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Excellent film with great acting,"I really liked this movie. It is about Hitler and his followers at the end of World War 2. I've seen it in Germany and when we went out of the cinema, everybody was very silent. You could see how much the movie had impressed all the viewers. The reason for this was (from my point of view), that the man who plays Hitler, plays his part in such a way that I almost believed he was Hitler himself. Further I found it interesting to see how his followers keep on following him till the end, it gave me the shivers that one man can get many others to follow him blind.

"History on film, told in a superb form","Excellent, truly excellent movie. Don't miss on this one. Der Untergang tells a part of Europe's recent history from a different perspective. More than the perspective, it is very pleasant to watch -- in the sense that it lasts over two hours and time flies; the movie is rather heavy otherwise. Expect violent scenes, and war portrayed as the awful event it is.Der Untergang translates as The Downfall or The Decline. The movie exposes Hitler's and its inner group's last days in Berlin, as the Soviet takeover became unavoidable. It is based off reports from Hitler's secretary, so should be somewhat accurate. You even get a short interview clip with her remembering that period of her life, by the end of the movie, which, to me, reinforced how recent WW2 is.You get the idea that Hitler is mad or maddening, which was, to me, unexpected. From what the press is writing, I went to the theater expecting a human view of the dictator. It is not. Hitler is clearly a madman.I was not disappointed, however. In that period, it is natural he was in an extreme, and losing his edge. On the contrary, I came out wishing there was another movie telling the story of his rise to power from such a intimate angle.I'm still surprised how a modern democracy was able to give its power to a madman. Hitler must have had a perfect public image back then, and studying how democracy failed with him is a most interesting topic, certainly interesting for a movie.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
All Is Lost!,"Berlin April 1945: The Red Army has launched it's last great offensive of the Second World War with a massive armored and infantry assault on the German capital. Deep inside a bunker underneath the German Reichstag is the German Fhurer Adolf Hitler, Bruno Ganz,and his general staff conducting the last desperate defense of the city but time is quickly running out with even the most fanatical and optimistic of them, with the exception of Hitler, know that the end is near and are looking to somehow escape from this hell on earth or at least negotiate a surrender with the attacking Soviets forces. It's these historic days during the spring of 1945 that are covered in the movie ""Downfall"".Explosive and blood-splattering film with an Acdemy Award caliber performance by Bruno Ganz as the German leader Adolf Hitler as his nation is being clobbered with daily and nightly one thousand plane bombing raids from the air and with millions of allied troops, on two fronts,swarming across it's borders on land putting an end to the Third Reich that he brought into power in Germany back in 1933. The total pandemonium that struck that city is realistically and graphically depicted in the movie that's based on the memories of Hitler's personal secretary Traudl Junge, Alexandra Maria Lara, who was working for him in that capacity since 1942.One of the best movies about Hitler ever made has him shown in a very different light then the usual portrayals that were used to seeing him in the scores of films made about Hitler, and WWII, over the years. Wild threatening and hysterical towards his generals when things aren't going right, which in the movie was almost all the time, Hitler showed his ""human side"" when it came to his personal staff. Insisting that they leave the city before it fell to the dreaded Red Army and also being grateful to them when they refuse and wanted to stay, and kill themselves, along with him when the end came.There's a great scene in the bunker when Hitler realizes that the ""great offensive"" that he expected by German General Steiner's 9th Army, to smash the Soviets and throw them out of Berlin, never materialized because he, Steiner, didn't have the men and tanks to do the job. Completely losing it and letting his generals have it Hitler at last finally realized, with the later defection of his two top honchos SS leader Himmler & second in command Goering, that the war was lost. Hitler then instead of trying to escape from the doomed city decided to stay at his post, as the German Chief of State, until it's defense was no longer possible then end it all by putting a bullet in his head.Terrifying scenes with blood and guts and body parts flying in all directions with even the Germans themselves, the Army and Nazi Gestapo, shooting hundreds of German soldiers and civilians who were trying to flee the city, to save their lives, for disobeying orders and not standing and fighting to the last man and woman like their Fhurer ordered them to.With all the horrors in the movies ""Downfall"" the one that struck me most, even though it was very minor compared to the rest of the carnage in the film, was the murder by the Nazi Misnister of Propaganda Joseph Gobbels and his wife Magda, Ulrich Matters & Corinna Harfouch, of their six young children by poisoning them as they were asleep. Determined to both kill themselves the Gobbels' didn't even want their children to survive the war saying that there's no reason for them to live in a world without National Socialism or their ""beloved Fhurer"" Adolf Hitler or uncle Adolf as he was efficiently called by them. the movie ""Downfall"" showed more then anything else how right the Union Civil War General Sherman was in his famous statement ""War is Hell"".",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Choice and cost,"'we never forced the people,' Mr. Goebbels said. 'they chose us.' Now is the time for them to die for their choices.
This, in my view, is at the heart of the German tragedy. It's just that the target of the culprit is so recognizable that people can easily shift the blame to them, making them more visible and visible. But good deeds may be done incognito, the rights of the people may be exercised by their representatives, but evil cannot be hidden or accounted for by their representatives. Hitler, as a human being, must have a human side; Since people are human beings, they must also have a bestiality. So Hitler could be the ""uncle"" of the little goebbels, and every bit of nazism in Germany could be combined to launch a powerful anti-semitic machine.
It's not a matter of ""cheating"" to cover up. 'but they're people,' says Grace to her father in dogtown. 'people have weaknesses.' The iron-faced father replied, so they have to pay for what they did. Von trier's technique is not only to save money, when all obstacles do not exist, when all the behavior of people are naked in front of each other, can not avoid, human nature no longer hide. When Grace was first raped, the residents of dog town went about their business as usual. The evil of transparency makes all calm absurd and disguised. What if those invisible walls really do not exist? What if the crime was exposed in broad daylight? Would things be different? Or do they really or pretend they don't? When it became an open secret that every man would go to Grace's room for the night, where did their eyes look? God is merciful, he let us learn to block. How many human weaknesses, cowardice, selfishness, cruelty are prevented by the four walls, avoid the test, the blame and the loss, so that we can continue to dress up to play their role, to god as an innocent good man.
But are we? Are we really good people? Are we worthy of our own moral and conscience?
'no one forced me to do this,' Traudl Junge says in the opening credits. 'it was my choice to go to Berlin.' At the end of the film, she added: I finally know, young, is not an excuse.
'I don't blame them,' Grace told her father. 'they've done their best in their environment.' 'if I lived in this environment, I couldn't do it any better,' she added.
If that is all, the hope that remains in Pandora's box really does not deserve to be possessed by humans.
Mankind deserves, perhaps, only the towering flood of god.
In von trier's box, too, was a spirit of hope. The bright moon like god's searchlight, let Grace clear out the reality of the dog town. She said to her father, they did their best, but it wasn't good enough, it wasn't good enough.
So the child was killed in front of the mother, the house was burned, the sky was red.
Hope had never been an angel, and the deal with morpheus was the only way out.
Someone is bound to accuse the director of suppressing violence with violence. But Grace has tried. The purity of the virgin can indeed infect and change people. However, they have their limits. They always come to a screeching halt before the dividing line.

Bruno Ganz IS Hitler!!,"We all tend to label as ""unhuman"" everything that's cruel and evil. We always want to make the genocides look like beasts when the truth is that there's nothing more human that the hatred, the sadism, the anger, the thirst for revenge... It's OK, it's only a way to protect ourselves against the idea of someone like us doing such horrible things. But don't you fool yourselves: there are no beasts with capacity for the humiliation and the annihilation but the Homo Sapiens.This movie, ""Der Untergang"" (the last days of Hitler in his Berlin bunker among his closest friends and politicians), was not welcomed by German audiences. There are too many bruises that haven't being healed yet. A movie showing Hitler suffering just like everyone else? The Führer acting like a gentleman in front of his personal secretary and taking good care of Goebbels' children? There are too many people that don't want to see such things. Hitler was a monster, he wasn't even human! He couldn't have a heart, he couldn't have loved anyone! Well, Oliver Hirsbiegel (the director of the irregular ""Das Experiment"") makes clear that the Emperor of the Third Reich was no madman (clinically); he loved Eva Braun, and he suffered in his last days just like everyone whose plans are crumbling down would have suffered (Ok, some plan to build a house in the seaside, some plan to invade Poland... plans, after all).We watch everything that's going' on in the Berlin underground through the eyes of Miss Junge, the personal Hitler's assistant, one of the few witnesses of those last hours. We can smell the sweat, we can feel the humidity, the terror that Hitler provoked in most of his subordinates, the chaos inside and outside the shelter, the hysterical laughing of those who know that are going to die soon. The portrait of the different personalities there is just superb: Eva Braun, THE lover, living in her world of fantasy; she just wants one more drink and one last dance. Mrs. Goebbels, maybe one of the most terrifying in the history of cinema (and what's not cinema), she seems to be even more extreme that Hitler himself. Those generals afraid of contradicting the Fuhrer, who still waits for some squadron to come and defeat the enemy. Outside, Berlin is on fire. The Russians, which had been invaded a few months before, now they are the invaders and they're gonna get into the centre of the Presedential Palace.So, this movie is bigger than life. The script and the the artistic direction are just perfect... nothing!! Nothing compared with Bruno Ganz's work He has brought Hitler to life (and I really mean it). A millimetric job, so blended, never falling in the parody. How to play a character whose histrionism and personality goes beyond any kind of limits? Well, Mr. Ganz has the answer to that. The rest of the cast is also outstanding, but Ganz is the genius here. ""Der Untergang: Hitler und das Ende des 3. Reichs"", one the best movie ever done about the Holocaust? And without Jews? Well, it looks like, my friends.*My rate: 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Bruno Ganz IS Adolf Hitler...!,"My Rating : 9/10'Der Untergang' or 'Downfall' is a movie experience I can't get out of my head. Bruno Ganz as Adolf Hitler is both terrifying and seductive. His mannerisms are too surreal.I remember the first time I watched it I wanted to watch it again immediately. Powerful, gripping, ruthless and shocking drama about Hitler's last days.
This is what you call a true gem of cinema (unlike Schindler's List, Forrest Gump or Saving Private Ryan which are annoyingly overpraised).",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Eavesdropping on History,"Greetings again from the darkness. Any filmmaker takes a risk putting the image of Adolf Hitler on screen. Many argue that providing any type of human image for this monster is too good for him. On the other hand, many believe there is much to learn from this tragic, horrific era. ""Downfall"" is based on two separate books by Joachim Fest and Traudl Junge. The movie begins and ends with portions of Frau Junge's final interview. It is painful to watch her in her 80's still struggling with choices made in her 20's. Her conscience still eating away as she asks the question of herself, ""Could I have known?"".Director Oliver Hirschbiegel has crafted a docu-drama that leaves us feeling as if we are in the bunker during those final 12 days. The emotions of all involved are gut-wrenching. It is stunning to witness Hitler's balancing act of continuing his pursuit of world dominance in front of his officers, while carefully orchestrating his own demise behind closed doors.While most of the acting is top notch, there are 4 performances that truly stand out. Alexandria Maria Lara as Traudl Junge was a joy to watch as she dutifully and loyally carries out her job tasks, while maintaining an immense respect and admiration for her boss. Juliane Kohler as Eva Braun literally brightens the screen and bunker every time she appears. Apparently comfortable with her place in history - beside her man in a hopeless situation, her smile never leaves as she exudes confidence for those closest to Hitler. Corinna Hartouch as Magda Goebbels ALMOST had me believing that lovingly poisoning one's kids could be forgivable when losing a way of life that has absorbed into their soul.Of course, what really makes this film work is the chillingly masterful performance of Bruno Ganz. It is as if we are watching home movies from the bunker. His power while strategizing with the officers and charm when dealing with kids and women are frightening. The most amazing times, however, come during his moments of soul-searching as he realizes the dream is lost.Accept this as an insight into history and not an attempt to humanize the monster. There are no signs that the filmmaker has attempted to excuse any of the decisions made by the regime. This is strictly a historical perspective on the confusion and paranoia brought on when power thirsty types lose their way. Amazing to watch.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
"The last days of the ""führer"" and the Third Reich","Astonishingly accurate and very authentic, the movie delivers an insight view into the ""führer"" bunker that many would have thought to be impossible to shoot. I think everybody agrees that all of the actors, especially Bruno Ganz (Hitler), did an outstanding job, confusing the audience whether they are watching a documentary with real footage or a movie. A huge controversy goes on with the question whether some scenes depict Hitler as being too handsome and human or not - I would say that the intention of the director and his movie are pretty clear on this subject: Hitler, though a mass murderer and the personalized evil, was a human being. Ergo, one has to show every side of his character. While focusing its attention mainly on the clearly dominating destructive side of the führer, the movie doesn't neglect the other, calmer side of him that seduced many people as well as his historic speeches did.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
"No monsters, but not my kind","One of the first movies to 'enlighten' us on what happened behind the curtains of the German high command. And to show their 'human' side and to try to portrait how they lived, how fanatic their devotion was to their fuhrer. In a way its refreshing because you feel it shows the truth... and the truth is so painful it took over 50 years before this movie could be made. I think this is one of the best 'anti' war movies ever made. Because it shows the failure of an 'absule' ideology, how following a man or an ideology blindly, can blind people from the Truth. Even when the Fuhrer himself can no longer see clearly.This movie shows that none of the Nazi top and high command were monsters... Humans are not monsters and never will be. Saying someone, is a monster, tries to dehumanize them, and thus imply that 'normal' human beings would never do such cruel things. This denial is the real big threat, because we all need to remember. That under the 'right' circumstances we could do terrible things, and this movie portraits the 'right' circumstances they were in.The flip side of the coin is that because the secretary of Hitler: 'Traudl' could see clearly Hitler as a human, she could not believe he could do such monstrous things.The movie shows also that an absolute ideology leads to absolute measures and actions, and for some of them the ultimate action, to commit suicide. To follow the rules of the ideology is all what matters, and here human decency is not one of them. This means destroying everything and needlessly letting civilians die. Hitler says: 'In a war, there are no civilians', 'We are a weaker people, so by the rules of nature our people will rot away'.Its becomes clear that children are even more susceptible to absolute values and are even more easily 'programmed', then adults. Seeing 14/12 year old children fight and die for their believes, makes that all too clear.I really found this movie astonishing, an psychedelic mix of violence, romance, love, madness and cruelty. The reality portrayed is so surrealistic it doesn't need a Hollywood sauce. The acting and special effect are so good you think your're actually there. But that was of course the intention, to let us relive a part of history we would be all too pleased to forget, but never should.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
"Powerful and real, you will smell of grit and smoke after this movie.","This movie was fantastic. It truly represents the talented film making that comes from the European market without the Hollywood budget. The actors portray their roles fantastically, you believe you are seeing the real Hitler, Goebbels, etc. The film goes deep enough to allow you to understand the mindset of the characters, given the circumstances they are in. It does so in a manner which prevents you from slouching in your seat for even a moment of this film, which runs a good part of two and a half hours. It masterfully dances on a line, balancing the viewer on an emotional tightrope between sympathy and anger for the characters. The thing that was the most impressive was the fact that there was no Hollywood sub-plot, that we all too often see with major motion pictures. This movie just focuses on Berlin, under siege, with no fictional heroes- only one inevitable conclusion- utter capitulation. This movie is well worth any price of admission.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Perfectly Done!!!,"From the moment I saw the preview for this movie I wanted to see it. It did not fall short of my expectations at all. Every bit of this film is perfect! From the acting, to the visuals, to the story, it all falls into place taking the viewer's breath away. I think it is perfect that a movie has been done to portray Hitler at the end, not just the persecution of the Jews. It's very interesting to look at WWII from this perspective. Much like Schindler's List it is very easy for the viewer to be taken in by this film, knowing that the ""main"" character is a real person and not a fictitious story teller reading from a history book. I would recommend this movie to anyone. This movie has made it to my personal top ten.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Accomplished and compelling film making.,"Not the most uplifting of movies but certainly one of the best movies made about WW2 if not one of the best war movies i have seen.As with this equally engrossing 'Das Experiment' the director places the viewer directly into the situation. Using natural lighting and muted colours in the bunker (where the majority of the film is played out)a somber and realistic mood is set, add to this the large amount of hand-held camera work and dark and chaotic battle scene one feels as though he/she is actually standing alongside the actors.The actors are another strong point of the movie Gantz as Hitler is superb, the loud ranting outbursts one expects from seeing documentary footage of the man are there but where Gantz' real triumph lies is that he portrays the character in a very naturalistic manner one almost forgets the stereotypical view of Hitler. The Nazies were shown in a more balanced light than cinema is used to, sympathetic sides were shown in regards to their attitudes to the plight of the German people and one Nazi Professor/Officer is portrayed in the film as an almost admirable character.Despite the balanced approach many horrors are in store for the viewer the hanging of 'so called' traitors in the streets images of child solders killed and the horrific final minutes of the Goebels children ensure that this movie will haunt you after its closing scene.As with all movies I'm sure some details are not 100% correct but then neither are the all the school text books like 'Schindlers List' or 'The Killing Fields' this is not easy viewing it is however a excellent film and a good dramatic history lesson.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

Amazing movie!,"I think the makers of historically based films have a great responsibility, it is their duty to mankind and history to show things 'as they were'. I think this movie has done just that, shown 'truth' without propaganda, with out black and white heroes and villains...something very hard to do when dealing with the history of Nazi Germany. Especially in regard to WWII, too many films and books still have this 'post cold war hang over'.This movie is really one of a kind because there is just so little out there dealing with the end of the Reich (most films are about victory, while this one is about the defeat part of that victory).",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
the only word i can think of..is amazing,"honestly this is one of the best movies i've ever seen, this movie takes you literally to Berlin in Apr 1945..with amazing sound effects where ur seat shakes whenever there was a bomb dropped on Berlin. Ganz played Adolf Hitler in the best way an actor can personalize someone, u will start thinking of him as the real Hitler..he speaks the very same way..he wakes and yells and even his hand shakes the same way..he deserved an Oscar for this amazing acting. one point i wanted to clear as we all heard how lots of ppl and newspapers and magazines rejected this movie...for that the movie shows a human side from Hitler...and thats very wrong coz Hitler was not human at all...for me i think the movie was VERY realistic..after all Hitler wasn't a vampire or a zombie feeding on dead bodies..this movie showed his human side which i believe it was very realistic..and his crazy insane obsessed side..which i also think it was realistic..so the movie didn't add or delete anything..it just dumped the truth in front of us..the truth as it has been told by an eye witness...Hitler's last secretary who died couple years ago. this movie deserves all the respect for the good making and for laying the truth as it is...10 out of 10",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Brilliant,"Downfall is truly an excellent film. One of those rare pictures where you can forget you are watching actors and actually believe in them as the real people they are playing. Bruno Ganz is uncanny as Hitler, and the supporting cast is uniformly fine. There is no music, just the dull thud of the Russian shells in the background. Although there have been many war films, the fall of Berlin, one of the most dramatic events of the 20th Century, has been neglected by filmmakers. It's good that it is a German film that has brought this period to the forefront again. I think every secondary school pupil should have to see this film, it is a piece of moving history as well as a gripping piece of cinema.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
"Best ""Final days"" movie yet","Recently I am getting more into Adolf Hitler by reading books written by such accomplished authors as the late Sebastian Haffner. I am German spending my first 24 years in Germany and both my parents went through through WWII so I have some idea - and a strong personal interest - of what it was like. ""Downfall"" (Der Untergang) comes closest to the idea I have not only about the final days in Berlin but of WWII in general. The dialog is straight out of the period with only some minor compromises. German accents were (and still are) so different from each other that they have to be ""softened"" into ""Hochdeutsch"" to some extent in order to make everything understandable for audiences. I believe this is the case in any country.Of course Bruno Ganz delivers the very best Hitler portrait I have ever seen. He just nails the man. There is a human drama within his sick ""nature selects the strongest"" philosophy which tries to suck you into him. That is the most diabolical part of Hitler the man.I was totally absorbed by the impeccable photography by Rainer Klausmann which is pin sharp and has the colors exactly look like period color photography with emphasis on cyan (blue green) and yellow. I was surprised to see nothing that looked CGI. The beautiful musical score by Stephan Zacharias, mostly a small string orchestra playing melancholic tunes, suddenly joined by an oboe bringing some ""hope"" after the capitulation is official, is spot-on.Overall acting is absolutely impeccable finding the right balance between period feel and some added weight with perhaps only Joseph Goebbels being the weakest portrait - but the man was so unique that I am unable to blame Ulrich Matthes' otherwise impeccable portaial with the accurate slight Cologne area accent.This movie is very similar in tone to Wolfgang Petersen's ""Das Boot"" By showing the war as accurate as possible the movie automatically turns into an anti war film. The movie clearly avoids any comment about the war. It just brings you into the heart of Berlin during the last days of WWII.This movie was long overdue. Sir Alec Guinness' and others tried it earlier but Adolf Hitler cannot be translated into any language. Who better to make a WWII movie viewed from the German side than the Germans? And again: Bruno Ganz' performance is 100% Oscar material - but of course Adolf Hitler is too hot an issue to be considered. Maybe the Academy is right - this madman must never be anything even close to an idol. In any case: this movie is much better than the foreign film Oscar winner ""The Sea Inside"".Der Untergang, The Downfall: Highest rating!",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

All great movies from various directors in various periods. Excuse me for noting all that in this comment, but I was enchanted after I saw this grim and moving picture... Well, it's said enough.

an unblinking visceral experience,"I am almost 50 and very familiar with the iconography of WWII. I even lived in West Berlin for several years in the 1980s, and in a prosaic way perhaps this film merely adds to the canon. But, for me it is the flawless performance of Bruno Ganz, that is the key to the power of this film. You actually believe Ganz is Hitler and the film's close attention to the monster as a human simply amplifies the deep rooted madness, the inhumanity, the cruelty of the man and thereby the underlying evil of the regime. But words are inadequate to explain Downfall. This is pure cinema: slow, cool and deliberate. I need to see this film again at least twice more.

"A genuine classic, humanising Germans in WW2","Downfall (Untergang, Der (2004)) War films can be the most emotive genre in cinema, but even in the company of other classics such as Platoon, Bridge over the River Kwai and Apocalypse now, German movie ""Downfall"" more than holds its own, and is simply one of the best yet. It covers the final days of Hitlers rein before and after his suicide in Berlin, covering the lives of all those around them. The genius stems from the acting whereby they more than convince you that you are actually watching Hitler, Goering etc in the flesh, and additionally the story doesn't simply demonise the characters but starts afresh and makes them human.Hitler is shown as deluded, paranoid and threatening, and unsettling as it may seem at points you almost sympathise for him, but overall you see his ego and lack of sympathy for his fellow German. The other characters chart a cross section of Berlin society, and they conjure up the fear, delusion and suffering in the face of inevitable defeat, realistically staging the pain that must have engulfed the country at that time.The film being made in German itself (and by Germans) adds a personal touch I guess to the movie, and adds a new dimension to war films. For too long, WW2 has been treated too much like as if it were all Star Wars, when the truth is actually much more complicated. This film hopefully helps to redress the balance a little bit.If you have a chance, I'd strongly recommend it. Damns the Nazi regime by just showing them as they were, but also highlights the suffering many Germans themselves went through which has been pitifully ignored over the years. A genuine, touching classic story which sadly in light of the rise of recent terrorism shows that the lessons that have to be learnt are as relevant today as they ever were.

"Chilling, insightful, and stunning - Ganz is truly amazing","Robert Altman once said that if every movie were like its trailer, every movie would be exactly the same. The TV ads for Oliver Hirschbiegel's ""Downfall,"" starring Bruno Ganz as Hitler, are making it look like an action war movie about heroes and villains. There are a handful of explosions in the movie, and all of them are in that ad  and little else. Those expecting violence and a neatly packaged message may be disappointed, or perhaps, like me, surprised by the movie's insights, depths and power.The movie does, certainly, have scenes of carnage and battle  how could a movie set in Berlin in the last days of World War II not?  but the majority of the story unfolds in the claustrophobic rooms and corridors of Hitler's bunker. The movie follows the stories of Hitler, Eva Braun, Traudl Junge, Hitler's private secretary, and a doctor whose conscience gets the better of him.Hitler has been represented in countless other movies, and he is usually shown as a caricature of evil, or a mocking imitation (most famously in Charlie Chaplin's ""The Great Dictator""). Ganz's performance surpasses them all; it surpasses imitation, and he presents Hitler as human, as a paradox, as a man affected by both evil and madness. There is a pre-title scene where he stands upright in his early days in power, as he hires a secretary. He has a certain charm over women and, later, we see the way that children, too, adore him; 'Uncle Hitler,' they call him. Later, as the end of the war looms, we see the cruel way he presides over his maps and diagrams, ordering troops into certain death. He is so cut-off from humanity that his view is that if Berlin falls, its inhabitants do not deserve to live. His back becomes hunched as he barks out orders, his hands darting in all directions; its astonishing to consider that this is the same actor who was so serene and introverted in Wim Wender's ""Wings of Desire.""The two main criticisms I have heard made of ""Downfall"" are that it is not historically accurate, and that Hitler becomes too human; too sympathetic. ""Downfall"" may not include all the facts, but it is not propaganda; it has no political motives or agenda. Its motives are to help the audience question situations and events that are beyond the grasp of most modern people's understanding. Movies are not the medium for fact; the truth of ""Downfall"" is in the way it sums up the conflicting feelings of a deceived and confused people.What would have been wrong and 'inaccurate' would be to deny the fact that Hitler was a person, and not just an evil force, like something from a comic book. I'm not trying to say he was not an evil person; just that an evil person is still a person.Yes, it is a 'troubling' movie, as Stanley Kauffman pointed out in his review. How could it not be? What use would a movie which showed Hitler as lacking humanity have? What interest would it have? The movie is being criticised where it should be praised; it does not manipulate the audience, or tell you how to feel. That's where its power comes from. Watching the real Traudl Junge at the movie's end, I had tears in my eyes. It's difficult to say what is so moving about the film. When Hitler dies, we do not sympathise with him; in fact we feel a certain relief, because it means the end is in sight. His way out was an easy one, but the others had to live the rest of their lives with a burden on their conscience. Traudl Junge liked Hitler as a person, and that was her own downfall.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

Same for Ulrich Matthes as Goebbels, outstanding acting. You can really feel the atmosphere in the bunker and maybe understand deeds and actions that seemed unbelievable before.

A Nutshell Review: Downfall (Der Untergang),"I watched this film to learn more about the final days during the Battle of Berlin, and to know more about Adolf Hitler and the twilight of his Third Reich at the end of WWII. A good movie can be made based on this premise alone, and true enough, I was blown away, as this film offered a lot more.Told through the eyes of many historical characters - the various war generals, a defiant Hitler Nazi Youth, Eva Braun, Hitler's stenographer Traudl Junge, and of course, Hitler himself. However, this film never exhibited a case of too many cooks spoiling the broth, as each perspective focused on different aspects during the fall of Berlin. There are those who talk about surrendering, some who want to fight to the end, holding onto the Fuhrer's belief that their troops outside Berlin will come to their rescue. You get a good sense of what's happening in the bunkers as Hitler's slowing losing it all.But this film is not all about talk and no action. Those expecting blood and gore from a war movie, will get just that. The filmmakers did a wonderful job re-creating war torn Berlin, and the bunkers in which Hitler and his generals spent their last days in. We don't get to see the Russians much, but we jolly well hear each and every Made-In-Russia artillery shell that's raining down - the entire movie really makes you feel like you were there in a war zone - every arty raid, every bullet fired. You'll get to see grizzly mock hospitals, where doctors amputate limbs. Suicides are common too, and you see blood and brain matter splatter on screen.The many characters are well-acted and brought to life effectively, but I'd like to put the spotlight on Bruno Ganz's portrayal of Hitler. It really brings the chills, and we can see the many hours of research bringing in results of every nuance the Fuhrer had, right down to Parkinson's.This film, while it humanizes Hitler and his generals, doesn't suggest that they are innocent of their war crimes. It puts into perspective the ""other side"", giving the audience a chance to perhaps understand the happenings in the fall of a regime.Though it's 2 1/2 hours long, for someone interested in WWII and the Fall of the Third Reich, you'll never notice its length, and will clamour for more. Highly recommended.Postscript This film is a Cathay Cineleisure exclusive showcase, and today's sneaks happened to be in the smallest hall #6, which is a pity. Tickets are few, and sold out early.

All of the actors and actresses in this movie really nailed their parts as well. When the movie is over, all you can do is say ""Wow"". You'll actually believe you're watching archival footage from World War II. The sets are expansive and the special effects are extraordinary.

One of the most important movies ever made?,"Through the decades since the end of World War 2, we've come to regard Hitler and the Third Reich as somewhat of a confusing question mark in history: how could this have happened? This movie, perhaps more than any other, tries to answer that question by presenting a unique view of the last days of the Third Reich. It explores the question of why people can be led so easily into hell and the madness of self-destruction by one man, and one idea. The bunker simply serves as a convenient setting to examine this question: after all, it's only at the end, with death imminent, with time for self-reflection, that we can get a really convincing picture of the motives and thinking of those who were involved. ""Why?"": I think that's the central question of this movie. No more, no less. And because of that I think it's one of the most important movies that have been made in a long time, maybe ever.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Extremely well made movie.,"This is a movie that was made with lots of profession, both in front and behind the camera.Without doubt the best thing about the movie is the portrayal of Hitler by Bruno Ganz. The fact that he even didn't at least got an Oscar nomination should be considered a criminal offense. The rest of the cast is also top-class, the best acting I've ever seen in a German movie.The movie is emotional touching but without making Hitler a sympathetic character. There are some really powerful moments in this which I'm not going to spoil, it's simply just something you've to experience.In most movies and documentaries Hitler is simply portrayed as a mad monster. In this movie we get to know him in his humane form and makes us realize that he really was just a man after all. In a way it makes it all even scarier, if he was just a man than why is there a reason to believe that all of this can't ever happen again? Movies like this should work as a warning for the future for the entire world.The atmosphere and cinematography work all very well and make the movie really powerful.Only real complaint is that it focuses too much on some of the events outside of the bunker. It focuses a bit too much on some needless plot lines and characters, especially in the first halve of the movie. The scene's all work very well and are made with lots of profession but they just seemed out of place. In my opinion it would had been better for the movie if it had only focused on the events inside the bunker and create a claustrophobic atmosphere with the sound of dropping bombs in the distance.

Another kind of view to the history,"Okay, so before you watch this movie clear your mind from all prejudices and think again about all Nazis being dead hearted monsters. Der Untergang is a very interesting example for every monster is ALSO a human being.For me the best thing was, that in school they taught me six times about all the crimes that happened during the time of the 3rd Reich but never anyone told us about the humans that were involved. I once wanted to know, where Adolf Hitler was born, and I asked a teacher, he told me, that he didn't know, and it doesn't matter, for the only important thing about him were the 6 Million Jews he killed.Please do not misunderstand me. Adolf Hitler is at least one of the worst, if not the worst criminal in history, but it makes me sad that nearly nobody thinks about him being human, and a disturbing realistic movie like Der Untergang becomes necessary to show the people that even he was.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Of historical importance,"Very well made and acted. The downward spiral ends with Hitler. From his suicide onwards you can perceive the darkness begin to lift. In Hindsight what is amazing to see is that some of the NAZI refuse or cannot see it happening. For those sad souls, the death of Hitler is the end of the world. Most chilling is the extinction of the Goebbels family. The guilty also take away with them the innocent who are associated with them, such as the children and the dog. You also feel sorry for Hitler himself, he has made his pact with the devil, and he appears gone from us as a normal human being despite the attempts by Eva Braun to put some humanity back in. This is not just a historical film but also a study in psychology as well.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
The Most Amazing historic drama ever!!!,"The film may be rather long-winded but it is forever made up by the many other pros this film has.The acting is spectacular... Bruno Ganz gives an amazing performance as the disheveled, betrayed Adolf Hitler. Juliane Köhler's portrayal of the beautiful but mad Eva Braun amazes the audience...This film, however dark has some humorous (if black comedy) moments. The film really portrays the last days of many of the people in that bunker splendidly.The film is claimed to be based on fact however; like all ""factual"" dramas there is a certain unbelievable factor to it. However what this film will guarantee is that it will without doubt (even though everybody knows the history) leave you speechless for several minutes when the credits start rolling up.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
an interesting look at Hitler's final days.,"bruno ganz's Hitler was outstanding. i had to remind myself during the film that i was not watching a documentary and that it was an actor - he should be nominated for his performance. i cannot begin to describe how well bruno ganz portrayed Hitler.i never quite understood why so many followed Hitler and were willing to sacrifice their lives and their children's' lives for him and his ""cause"". this movie shines some light into Hitler's character, revealing qualities and traits never before seen in Hollywood's Hitler. you can almost begin to understand why people looked up to him; yet the film does not let you forget what he did, how many people died because of him and the evil inside his plan.in my mind there is nothing controversial about this film. it is well acted and well-shot. scenes are endearing, brutal, depressing and just plain interesting. at the end of the film the audience is not ""converted"" nor does the film cause you to pity Hitler and his followers. instead you are left with more of a balanced outlook on the second world war - suddenly you realize that there were no winners and too many casualties on both sides.this film should be remembered as one of the great films dealing with the second world war.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
An excellent German film,"I've watched many successful films about the World War II. Something was missing about the conclusion. That was because all films had reflected the Allies' point of view. I was wondering what Germans would say about the ending of war in terms of cinema. Der Untergang should be added to the top class films as Saving Private Ryan and Schindler's List. It is a realistic Hitler film introducing a perfect acting by Bruno Ganz. It is also an ultimate success for Oliver Hirschbiegel. He deserves to be congratulated as a first class director. Of course there are a few words to add about Adolf Hitler. He had many crimes and sins of which he was aware. But he was not a monster, a human being which gives us a lesson on what can be the consequences of a wrong idea on patriotism, nationalism and Darwinism. The important thing is not what we think, it is what we do and how we do.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
What Can Be Said? Perfect...,"The end of the Third Reich, in its purest form, without taking sides and making comments and with the highest standard of acting and cinematography; this was all we need for years.I have heard that in Germany there had been a great debate about this film if it showed Hitler from a humanitarian side.We saw that it just showed him just as he is. But the most interesting thing that we haven't seen in any other WWII movie before is the portrayal of Waffen SS and Wehrmacht soldiers as ordinary soldiers, not like monsters or unskilled and unexperienced soldiers in Hollywood movies before.Besides this we see that the best acting of battle hardened German officer characters are played by Germans themselves. It would be better if the battle scenes would be much more.Definitely a masterpiece...",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Definitely worth watching,"I find the greatest assets of the film to be its total historic accuracy and complete realism. It is absolutely believable, some scenes are even hard to watch, but this is what it was like. The depiction of the moral decay that overwhelms doomed men and women is awesome in its cruel veracity. In other, I think that Bruno Ganz did a fantastic job in physically impersonating Hitler, but lacked in the oral interpretation (I watched the original German version). Also, I found some of the schizophrenic aspects of Hitler's character to be a little overblown, as well as the characterization of Eva Braun a little superficial. All in all though, a very good film worth sitting in for 2 1/2 hours.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Perhaps the strangest way any war has ended.,"I have seen docos and read of these strange last days of the Third Reich. This movie recounted those facts but was so much more than a history lesson-which is what it was with the extra dimension of human drama that could not be dealt with by a documentary.The two plus hours of this engrossing film passed swiftly after entangling me in the extraordinarily fine acting, cinematography and lighting of the talented people that produced such a great film. I mention the lighting artistry because 99% of this film takes place in Hitler's bunker in the final days of the war; therefore, the constraints of shooting indoors would have taxed these guys to the max and their result was perfect.The script writers, Bernd and Eichinger, took the memoir's of Hitler's secretary and shaped them into a movie of excellence and are to be congratulated.Magda Goebbels must be one of the ultimate characters in European history and Carinna Harfouh played her beyond great-something that only the best of the best could carry off. A mother that commits the gravity of the acts that she committed in those last hours in the bunker warrants more notoriety than she has. I believe people should see the movie just to watch Harfouh's acting-it is a tour de force! This is not to take anything from Ulrich Mathes who played her husband, Joeseph Goebbels, who viewers can always identify because he is the only one in that brown uniform amongst a sea of Nazi army uniforms.A final word must be said of the killings in the film and the decisions that accompanied them-these killings, beyond the executions for what the remaining officers believed was desertion, were suicides by the men and women remaining in the bunker. Execution for some suicide for others because, as Magda Goebbels said, ""I cannot live without National Socialism"". It is scary that some people can feel so strongly about a cause.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
The Last Days of Adolf Hitler,"When we think of World War II, we think of epic battles and storming beaches. There was the naval battles in the Pacific and the land warfare in Europe. One of the most infamous people of WWII was Adolf Hitler, a man that brainwashed an entire nation into believing in his cause. Considered one of the most powerful evil geniuses in history, his final days were not so cunning. The last days of Adolf Hitler can now be seen.In Oliver Hirschbiegel's epic Downfall (USA title), we see the end of WWII for the German's. Berlin is surrounded and Hitler (Bruno Ganz) is running out of options fast. He and his staff of experienced commanders are now faced with a huge decision, stay in Berlin and try to fight off the Russian's, or surrender and try to make a peace treaty. Hitler will have no talk of surrender, for he would rather commit suicide than see his country beg for mercy. His newly acquired secretary Traudl Junge (Alexandra Maria Lara) is caught up in the mess of things. The Russian's are closing in on the city and the morale is fading fast amongst Hitler's commanders.In the streets, there are those who are loyal to the Nazi party and Hitler's reign. They fight till they have no bullets left and then end their life. There are those who hide in the ruins of the once prosperous city. Hitler and all of his cabinet are stationed underground to avoid any bombings from the invaders. It is here that the commands are sent out and the roots of treason are mended. One by one some of Hitler's 'top dogs' start to open negotiations with the US, England, and Russia, issuing the surrender of Germany due to Hitler's incapacity to continue his rule. Upon hearing the news of his commander's treachery, the Fuhrer is enraged, wanting them arrested and executed. Soon, everyone in the bunker is feeling anxious of Hitler's next move.Hirschbiegel's film is a masterpiece, delivering on many levels. What is shown on film is a powerful portrait of one of the most sinister men to walk the earth. He is scene as the Fuhrer, a man who with order can kill hundreds and thousands of innocent people...because he can. Then there is the side people don't see, the real Adolf Hitler. This is what Traudl sees and what Eva Braun has come to love in him. His spirit almost broken, Hitler looks as if he has aged way beyond his years. Ganz is brilliant as the Fuhrer and gives him human qualities when he is usually looked at as a monster.Downfall is a stunning account of the last days in Adolf Hitler's bunker. The final battles between the Russian's and the German's are coming to an end. This is the downfall of the Nazi Regime, and the entire globe is waiting for the biggest war ever to come to an end...",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Possibly one of the most remarkable documentary dramas ever made,"Downfall is an achievement on a tremendous scale, and all the better for being a German film since it chronicles the final days of a Hitler, who not only devastated half the known world and a very large number of Jews, but also most of his own country and the people who had put their trust in him long before he ascended to a position where he could abuse it on such a massive scale. It is a fascinating story because although we feel we 'know' it, it has never really been told on film, and never so forcefully or by his own countrymen (who of course play Germans, good and bad, much better than American imitations in Hollywood!) The film also comes at a watershed where Germans are coming to accept their history, as is the rest of the world, without feeling they have to apologise for Hitler at every breath. German people of that time, it might be argued, were also (at least very many of them) victims of a madman who were forced to endure the destruction wrought by the Allied bombing. That is true of almost any horrific dictator, but the film is careful not to over-humanise him. We see those (some, not all) of those near to him secretly horrified at his views - both regarding the destruction of Jews and the destruction of his own people. But the credits also point out that, even among the populace, ignorance was no excuse. Downfall is no revisionist whitewash - it is perhaps as honest an attempt as any could be to portray the last days of a madman, still clinging ferociously to power. Everyone whose life or loved ones was badly affected by Hitler has the right to feel aggrieved, but it is not, for instance, limited to Jews or even non-Germans.As a documentary-style drama, Downfall is so convincing that we do feel we are watching the actual characters from history. We also see a range of German people, from equally fanatical, evil-minded officers, to those who were simply in the grip of his power, to the women in his life, to some of the ordinary German people who had little idea of what was happening or others that were simply strung up or treated as expendable for having put Hitler in power in the first place. Hitler's psychology is also interesting. We almost see his fatal flaws come to light, his disrespect for equality, his determination to put his own skewed philosophy before people (even the citizens of Berlin in the bunker above him). It asks if the one of the strengths of the Allies was a love of humanity, a desire to work for the common good. It reminded me that mankind as a species, however competitive, has achieved dominance over the animal kingdom and flourished largely through a sophisticated system of cooperation and the ability to build trust Easily one of the most memorable dramas about Hitler ever made, Downfall will burn into your brain notwithstanding the German subtitles.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
"Quite a bit to take in in one go, but still an undeniably powerful and evocative movie","STAR RATING: ***** The Works **** Just Misses the Mark *** That Little Bit In Between ** Lagging Behind * The PitsA film detailing the last days in the life of Hitler (Bruno Ganz) in his bunker, as the Soviet army closes in and he madly clings on to his plans to retain domination.Before I saw it, Downfall was a small independent film I wasn't really that aware of, other than it had made it into number 9 in last year's top 10 list. But with this and some other high recommendations, when it was shown on Channel 4 last week it was recorded and I got round to giving it a go (having dismally forgotten to record the acclaimed Capturing the Friedmans the week before.) And I can definitely see why it got to where it did.I wasn't aware it was as long as it was going to be either, and I ended up watching it in two parts. And I was glad I did this for while the movie is expertly made and put together, all in one go it's a bit of a trek to sit through and, aside from being over-whelming, some of the scenes tend to become a bit repetitive, making the movie a little boring.Particular mention must go to Ganz in the lead role turning in a really good performance as Hitler, perfectly capturing the man, who could at turns be charming (especially in the company of women) practical and maniacal. There is a good supporting cast, but in the main role he is the best.Brilliant film that this is, it's better to be seen in two parts. It gets more engaging towards the end (not to mention more shocking!) But all in all a very well made depiction of a story that needed to be told and it's alarming that a piece of German cinema should have to top our charts when so much meaningless drivel gets made everywhere else. ****",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
A film which Hollywood would have NEVER be able to make,"I start this by saying only a few words about the movie itself: it is a must-see!

It is a tense, psychological, full of insight movie, devoid of any cheap clichés- so typical for American films. Better than ""Saving private Ryan"",and - from an intellectual point of view - far more entertaining and full of thrills than any Hollywood action movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
"Super Film, superb Acting","This film is one of a kind. In my opinion: one of the best film of all time. I was surprised by the whole productions. There are many films about WW-II German, most made in USA. Even with the best intention (saving private Ryan), it gets never even close to this one. If you haven't seen this movie yet, I would really suggest you to go and see.The film is about the last days of Hitler in his bunker in Berlin before the Russian came in 1945, told through the perception and experiences of his secretary Traudl. It portrayed Hitler trying to cope with the immense pressure of losing the war and getting caught by the enemy. His fear to end like Mussolini, his feeling of loneliness and hopelessness despite the presence of his close aids and his disbelieves that it could end like that. For once we see that Hitler is also a human being. Yes, I am afraid to say that in the very basic sense of being, he is a human person. What evil is his deeds, his political view, his propaganda's, his acts of war and any other things he is being accused for. The critics said the he is being too human portrayed by the actor. I can disagree with that. If you can see the whole issues from art point of view, Bruno Ganz played him the best. I am pretty sure if the Oscar is also given to ""foreigner"" he would won it with distance from any other contenders in 2004 Academy Awards (at least if one's is honest and free from any prejudice, historical burden or personal pains). After 60 years I would say so.Although Ganz was the center of the whole movie, it is fair to say that the whole production (director, actors, cinematography, ...) was top. The setting and the whole atmosphere breath the coming of the inevitable defeat (death). You are not seeing a movie but you're being sucked in the movie.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Gripping Docudrama,"""Downfall (Der Untergang)"" is a gripping docudrama that brings the History Channel to life, though I missed the contextual-providing talking heads and pop-up explanations, especially to know if there was anything new or revisionist in this German view of Hitler's last days in his bunker with his inner circle.As I am not a regular devotee of military channels, I frequently got confused and misplaced among the ensemble, such that I really needed the closing snapshots to tell me who was whom and what happened to them after the film ends at surrender (documenting that suicide preempted many from being Nuremberg defendants). While I thought these might have been tenacious yes men, my husband does watch those programs and he explained that these advisers were with Hitler from the beginning, unlike Stalinist purges.My husband also pointed out that some of Hitler's rants, chillingly portrayed by a dynamic Bruno Ganz, are not just paranoid ravings but accurately reflect his clashes with the upper class Prussian career military men who were naysayers to his pre-Stalingrad military successes, whereas his perceptions of the final military situation were quite delusional, especially once the top brass were afraid to tell him the truth.Evidently, what are new are the quotidian insights of life in the increasingly bizarre bunker provided by Hitler's secretary, which were revealed before she died in a book and interview documentary ""Blind Spot (Im toten Winkel - Hitlers Sekretärin"", an edited version of which was shown on U.S. TV; my husband objected that even she didn't witness some of the scenes that are particularly tense so some poetic license is probably taken. While it is these personal touches that some have complained make Hitler human, I found it more interesting to learn about the inner circle, as he obviously couldn't conduct his reign of terror alone.The film distinguishes among a spectrum of Nazi ideologues and fellow travelers at all levels-- the most fanatic are shown here as strident caricatures, particularly a scary Frau Goebbels who makes Livia Soprano look like fun and games, career soldiers, patriots and civilians, including child recruits, while Eva Braun is shown to be naive to the point of lunacy.Like ""Rosenstrasse,"" another contemporary German director's take on the period, director Oliver Hirschbiegel is determined not only to go beyond the old ignorance disclaimers to show the impact of World War II on ordinary Berliners as Hitler dismisses their plight (including, disconcertingly, a symbolically blond, blue-eyed boy whose travails outside the bunker we tensely follow throughout the film) and his loyalists throughout the ranks continue revenge until the last moments, though his insistence that there are no longer any civilians in this war could also apply to the London Blitz he fomented or the Allies' firebombing of Dresden. Just as the film seems to identify many reasonable Germans, including some at high levels, disgusted with war and the Nazis, both Hitler and Goebbals point out that they have been in power for decades with the acquiescence of the German people.While the script also carefully includes Hitler's paranoid anti-Semitism as part of his rabid philosophy until the end, the documentary coda about the facts of the Holocaust seem tacked on to assure audiences that the genocidal aspect of the Third Reich is not being ignored amidst choices of tactics, strategy, personality and loyalty.It's amazing that a docudrama whose outcome we already know can be so taut and riveting, such that you come out of the theater drained.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
What's Wrong with this picture?,"This movie is a major breakthrough in the art of telling history in a media that usually comes up short on accuracy. But there are problems, such as selective editing obscuring actual communication and statements. By leaving out minor important details, even this agenda-bender tends in subtle ways to reinforce the perception, for instance, that Hitler was practically senile and in complete denial about the inevitable end. In point of fact, to certain associates he lucidly admitted that the war with Russia could never be won; and in rare moments of honesty brushed aside notions that any armies were coming to save Berlin. These people were not stupid or completely crazy. Perhaps they clutched at straws, but in the diaries and specific day to day communications, Goebbels and Hitler were putting up a front for the others, they themselves weren't as deluded as edits make them out to be. What's missing from the film are about a thousand pages of inter-office memos, private discussions and phone conversations that reveal they're saying very different things to one another ranging sometimes to the total opposite, yet keeping it all sorted out. Hitler was often lucid with a surprising grasp of reality when he'd let his guard down in the bunker; including more baffling contradictions of that aspect of Hitler's personality might have revealed more of his inner motivations.While Ganz turns in a well researched Oscar-quality portrayal, Hitler himself was giving a portrayal, of a leader as the one man who would never give up, especially at 5 minutes to midnight; as the Kaiser had at ""the eleventh hour"" - prematurely in many German's minds - in 1918. Hitler's ruthless determination to stand and fight against all odds saved countless German lives, while coldly sacrificing many others, though not nearly in as detached a manner as Stalin, who wasted millions upon millions of Russian lives in order to win.Hitler's greatest achievement of the war was preventing total catastrophe and collapse of the Russian Front, and thus perhaps subsequent Soviet capture of central and western Europe. I'm referring to the conclusions of serious historians such as John Toland, not those of Nazi sympathizers. As dramatized in DOWNFALL, young boys were sent personally by Hitler to die for their country; and against all odds a few doomed boys actually held a bridge long enough for civilians and deserters to reach American lines. The implication is that these boys died to keep Hitler alive a few more days. Yes, but it's more than that.If a tiny tinge of humanness is so astonishing to associate with Hitler, there was much more of that going on in recorded history from that period alone than this movie can show, since real time is very different than a 2 hour condensation. Something had to be left out. The question is what, and why?Many viewers of DOWNFALL have been genuinely shocked by the stand-out scene of Magda Goebbels taking the lives of her own children. Ask why she did it, by reading between the lines. Would it have made sense to surrender herself and her young daughters to the sympathetic Soviet soldiers of the Red Army? Should we interpret Magda's personally administering the execution of her children as an act of insanity? Was her last statement a calculated epitaph to secure a place in history for not betraying Hitler at the last minute as he said he had been by Himmler, Goering and everyone in the old guard except for Joseph Goebbels? Was she fearful of what would happen to her family if captured alive - especially her daughters? Reports reached the bunker that the Red Army, ever since taking East Prussia, were openly raping German women to death, age 3 to age 80; imagine 50 to 100 guys going wild with your daughters and that's the last time you'll ever see them, alive. Maybe that morphine/cyanide cocktail is starting to sound like a preferable solution to a worst case scenario.Bruno Ganz has transcended the limitations of the final edit, which in spite of a sincere effort, selectively waters down the reality of certain events going on. That's a tall order to fill, to be fair, and meanwhile Ganz playing a very difficult part nails it, soaring above performances given by other fine actors playing Hitler in the final days: Richard Baseheart ""HITLER""; Alec Guiness ""HITLER: THE LAST 10 DAYS"", Anthony Hopkins ""THE BUNKER""; though they provided some insight into the man dragging everything with him into the abyss. I'd be more impressed if a filmmaker from Germany dared to look without flinching and reflect without filtering, the naked face of the actual man. Whoever and whatever Hitler is. Start from scratch. As little bias as possible. As much detail as possible. Shoot it in real time if possible. Just run the damn speeches, watch the real thing but, we want to see the private life and inner man don't we? The last 10 days or so are least entertaining period of Hitler's life, as far as film goes. A few kind comments about the spinach, that's controversy enough for now, one bite at a time. Chew slowly. Stick to the chronology and facts, let the chips fall where they may. No admission under 17 maybe. Can we tell it on film without reinforcing the same old stereotypes? That is my challenge. German films have faced the dark side of humanity head-on like none others, as in ""M"", ""The Testament of Doctor Mabuse"", ""Metropolis"" and ""The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari"" perhaps. Maybe German films are getting up the nerve to face their demons again.

The Final Days,"Classy and stylish depiction of Hitler's final days centering on the tale of his secretary Traudl Junge. The horror of a city in siege is fully depicted in all its gore and misery. The late Bruno Ganz impressively portrays the Führer by look and action as he shows an ill and delusional figure who was detestable in his inhumanity as he was pathetic in his failure to face reality. The comely Alexandra Maria Lara shines as the beleaguered and torn secretary who manages to escape from the clutches of madness into freedom.

"Best ""Hitler's Bunker"" version ever!","As a WWII history buff, I have seen numerous ""Hitler's bunkers"" flicks over the past 20 years growing up in Europe (and there are too many too list---American, Brit, German, and of course Soviet!) but this has to be by far the best adapted, most accurate versions of them all. One of the qualities that makes this historical gem stands out from the rest is its objective approach, presenting the nitty-gritty realities and chaos of WWII Berlin at the end of the war, portraying the Germans both as aggressors and victims with minimal politically-correctness ""pins."" Another exemplary feature of the film is its historical accuracy---from the war torn settings (bomb-out Reichchancellory, bunker, SS murdering rampages) to the relatively accurate plot to the authentic characters. Bruno Ganz's---had he been a Gringo, he'd have received Oscar nod for sure--- depiction of the Austrian ""little corporal"" (Hitler's generals reference to him behind his back) is the best I have seen to date, from Furher's megalomaniac mood swings to his delusions of grandeur and insidious evil magnetism. Beside the underlying psychological makeups of the characters, I particularly like the peripheral though informative elements of the film, such as images of widespread destructions of Berlin streets and the desperation of its inhabitants, the omnipresent terror and indiscriminant butchering of the innocents by Nazis zealots even as the ""curtain falls."" For a major motion pic, it did not spin or play to conventional beliefs as other big flicks have a tendency to do in order to appeal to mass consumption rather than historical accuracy. With a few exceptions, the movie follows many of the events surrounding Hitler circle quite accurately compared to other ""insider"" accounts (such as Traudl and Speer memoirs) of this fascinating history. There are a few historical divergences (i.e. most ""bunker"" flicks have the Goebbels asking one of the SS officers for help instead of doing it themselves at the end); however, these are minor lapses. Other than that, this realistic war drama will definitely be ranked along side other recent WWII treasures such as Schindler's List and Das Boot.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
solid,"this is a pretty solid film revolving around Hitler's last days. The is some pretty decent character development of some of the generals surrounding Hitler (no Rommel though :( ) and gives a good sense of the urgency that Hitler may have felt when Berlin was falling. Great performance by Granz as Hitler and the guy that played Goebbels also did a solid job. A pretty long movie, but if you are into WW2 history, it is very solid and worth watching, lots of scenes of gripping tension between Hitler and his Generals and it is nice to see someone interviewed that was actually there at the time (hitler's secretary, which the film opens up with).

My review of Downfall,"So this movie didn't win a Oscar for Bruno Ganz spectacular performance or didn't win for best foreign language film, man f**k the Oscars.The movie is about a group of young women to Wolf's Lair, Hitler's headquarters in Eastern Prussia. They are candidates for the post of personal secretary to the Fuehrer. Among them is 22-year-old Traudl Junge, a fresh-faced girl from Munich. Traudl is chosen for the job and she is overcome with joy at the thought of serving beside her Fuehrer. BERLIN, APRIL 20, 1945: Hitler has retreated to a bunker system under the German Chancellery. Traudl Junge is asleep in her room, deep beneath the ground. She is awakened by tremors from artillery fire. The enemy is getting closer. Charting the last 10 days of Hitler's life, from his 56th birthday on April 20th, 1945 to his suicide on April 30th, the film uses multiple characters to show the chaos of a country coming apart at the seams, from Hitler's henchman under the streets of Berlin, to the soldiers and civilians fighting and dying as the Soviet Army ravaged the city above.You know that video on YouTube ""Hitler reactions to this"", and a lot of people may not know where that scene came from and it's this movie when it's during Hitler couple of minute rant and putting those reaction videos to the side this is a great scene if you can get pass that. I thought about bringing that up just in cause you didn't know.I what to start off this review by saying that Bruno Ganz gives one of the best performance of 2004 and probably my favorite performance of all time. Bruno Ganz got Hitler spot on and he delivered a masterpiece of acting. What Bruno Ganz did so well is add a little human to Hitler as you can see his struggle and I know we what to see him fail because his a horrible person but as horrible as he his he's struggle to win a battle that he started and it quickly going down hill slowly breaks him, at one point you slowly see him losing it and Bruno Ganz powerful performance that creates are powerful moment that we can feel a little bit of it. Amazing performance Bruno Ganz.The directing in this movie is what works the best as the director shows every detail of Hitler's upcoming fate. I forgive Oliver Hirschbiegel for directing the epic fail that was Diana the film as he made a better historical drama.For problems with the movie these not a lot to be honest, you can say it's kind of a snail paste at times with the pasting but that's really it for problems.Overall DownFall is excellent movie with amazing acting, great writing and directing and a brilliant historical drama.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

Not just the masking, but also Hitler's moving as you've seen it in old journal films from the time. The voice is there too.There is much good acting here, especially from Heino Ferch as Speer. Alexandra Maria Lara works by small although theatrical means as Hitler's secretary, but still preserves the documentary feeling. The only main character who doesn't really keep up with the rest of the crew is Urlich Matthes' Goebbels. Here ""theatre"" becomes to strong.See ""Der Untergang"". You will remember it for long.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
A portrait of a madman,"This is absolutely one of the best movies about the WWII! If you are a WWII fanatic and just have to have all the facts and stories from movies and discovery channel you have too See this one! I've never seen a better Hitler than Bruno Ganz. In the film ""Hitler, the rise of evil"" Robert Carlyle did a pretty good job, but he spoke English and he lacked the appearance of a powerful man, which Bruno possess.The movie really makes you think about the conditions during the end of this war. How sick the war was. And how brainwashed the people were by Hitler Jugend and the politicians.A 10/10 movie and at the top of WWII movies together with Schindler's list and Stalingrad.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

The proof that sheer facts can make a great movie,"This movie is compelling,the characters act as realistically as you can get,it is beautifully shot,but what astonishes the most is...it's a pure Documentary. No sympathisation of the allied or the axis powers (though it may seem like that,which is normal,because you experience the plot from the german point of view)
All in all,one of,if not the most compelling,well acted and well thought out documentational drama in cinema to date",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Excellent,"This is the absolute most brilliant movie I have ever seen! See it! definitely! There is no excuse for not seeing it!It portrays Hitler's last days to perfection, if not historically (even though I believe it does, I'm not that in to history so I can't guarantee it)- than at least dramatically! You know when you go to see a movie and everybody just storms out the theatre as soon as the film is over? - This is the first time I've been to see a movie where everybody stayed in their seats till the lights where lit again! AMAZING, BREATHTAKING, SOOOO TOUCHING! This is fantastic! I know I use a lot of these: !, But believe me - This movie deserves it! See it! If not, you are really missing out.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

Riveting,"Downfall is a fascinating movie, illustrating the fall of Nazi Germany and managing to stray away from simple dehumanisation. Featuring a frighteningly dead-on performance from Bruno Ganz as Adolp Hitler, Oliver Hirschbiegel's film never sympathises with it's characters, but rather complicates them, showing the depths behind evil and hatred. Shocking at best, compelling at worst, Downfall is one of the best realisations of Nazi Germany's fall ever made.Bookended with the last interview conducted by Hitler's real secretary (Traudl Junge), the film starts in 1942 with Adolph Hitler looking to recruit someone to type his letters and memoirs. He chooses Traudl (played by Alexandra Maria Lara) who is ecstatic to work with the Fuhrer. The film then cuts to 1945 inside Hitler's bunker, where it shall remain for most of the movie. Whilst Hitler is clearly the movie's selling point, it is largely told from Traudl Junge's point of view, being partly based on her autobiography - Bis zur letzten Stunde. We are presented with rational portrayals of those behind and around the Nazi regime - most notable are of Ernst-Günter Schenck (Christian Berkel) as a caring doctor and Albert Speer (Heino Ferch) who, despite his heavy involvement with National Socialism, is seen here as more humanitarian, pleading with Hitler to think of the German people.In order to deal with the cruelty of humanity we must first accept that it is humans - not monsters or animals - that are responsible for it's shortcomings. It is far too convenient for anyone to look at the world's most evil men - in this case Adolph Hitler - and segregate them from our perception of humanity, in order to make sense of their actions. Downfall presents to us a view of the Nazis not as sympathetic characters, but rather highly complex ones. As as protagonist, Bruno Ganz' Hitler is an engaging character, with many depths. He is too proud to surrender or retreat from the Allies -even after all hope appears to be lost he still strives to fight the invading Red armies. It's clear that he is close to losing his mind, and even condemns his generals as traitors, when the most apparently rational thing to do is withdraw his armies from attacking the incoming Russians. Hitler is rightly shown up as the abhorrent despot he clearly was, but rather than shouting and bleating his way through 155 minutes, Bruno Ganz depicts a man who has compassion behind the madness. His relationships with Albert Speer and Traudl Junge show us the gentler side of the monster, as he is almost like a father figure to them.The movie doesn't necessarily solve any unanswered questions, but does leave the viewer pondering it afterwards. As a historical document it works well, but as a a piece of compelling cinema it works even better - finding heart where many wouldn't dare to look, actually moving it's audience as well as engaging them. Hirshbiegel dissects all sides of the human condition. Magda Goebbel's final acts are particularly shocking, balancing the movie's heart with it's dirt. It's not always easy to watch, but it is pretty compelling stuff. If only to see for Ganz's turn, Downfall is something you should not miss.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
The movie is about Hitler's last days in his bunker in Berlin!,"This movie is one of the best war movies of all time. It shows the situation in the Fürherbunker in 1945 and the final days of Hitler. Bruno Ganz has the important role of ReichsFürher Adolf Hitler, and he does it greatly, he is excellent as Hitler! This movie is not only the best German film I have ever seen, but it is also the best movie over all that I have seen! There are many actors portraying all the people that were with Hitler in the Fürherbunker when he committed suicide, and all of those actors get the characters they are playing so really well. The movie is based mostly on the story of Hitler's secretary Traudl Junge. Finally Germans, you have done a movie to be proud of! Bravo!",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
"Courage, fearlessness and self-help are the pillars which sustain the dome of a successful life...","Tells how to maintain your identity in the difficult of the CircumstancesA very good movie...that is the first thought after watching it. It compels you to think and think over it again and again and again. The circumstances in which Hitler and his companions maintain their identity sometime irritates you but... that is the trademark of their great confidence. The way they killed each other and their child is note worthy. An extraordinary example of self confidenceAlso, it shows the belief his mates has on Hitler, especially in the scene when he calls doctor to ask how to suicide and the nurse tells him not to lose hope is just magnificent.As per acting, everyone including the support case looks pretty descent.In last, it is shocking for me that Hitler marries when he knows that he is going to die... that shows the unbreakable confidence of his mates over him.A must watch...",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
The Downfall,"So it seems that some people ( especially from Denmark ) have not understood what that movie wants to describe. It does not want to show Hitler as nice uncle, the perversion of the 3rd Reich is described in many movies before so why do we need thousands more of that movies? To our friends from Denmark: Germany today is not like in 1933. I bet in Denmark, France, England, Italy and Holland you can find more Nazis than here. So you believe what television says when they talk about Germany today ? Good night my friends, it is like I say ""In england all people eat fish and chips, all Americans eat hamburgers..."" What poor sort of prejudices, most people here know what happened in the past and we all know it must not happen again so you people don't know anything about Germany, just watching the sleazy TV-progamm, do you think this is enough to say such things ? You should better watch what is going on in your own country but i bet you don't even know that.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Truly great WW2 film,"Very interesting and factual account of the last days of the Third Reich, Bruno Ganz is magnificent as the Fuhrer and all the other actors are top notch. I am a WW2 buff and this movie comes very close to the actual events that occurred during those last dark days in the Berlin bunker. Seen thru the eyes of Traudl Junge, (the real Traudl Junge has a scene at the opening and close of the movie) Hitler's secretary during the last 2 1/2 years of the Reich, we get to see first hand accounts of Hitler's world crashing down around him. The film takes us thru all the events happening in the bunker including Magda Goebbels poisoning her 6 children and Hitler's last minute marriage to Eva Braun. This film is a brilliant piece of work and a must see for anyone interested in WW2.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
This film's major contribution.,"To me, perhaps the main issue addressed by the movie is to what an extent an uncritical, no-questions-asked support of a leader not only by his people but by his close entourage and society's controlling institutions may go. That such an uncritical attitude and obsessional following or obeisance of any whims and decisions of a leader or ruler can -and in time, will- bring ruin and dissolution to a society (as it certainly did to one of the most cultured ones in the world) is the lesson all watchers of this movie must learn. And this will apply not only to Hitler (that he is not depicted or clichéd as having Jewish kids for breakfast is beside the point) but to any other leader or ruler in any country of the world. It may be argued that Hitler was no better or worse than other despots in 20th century history, call them Stalin,Pol Pot or Castro, as differences in their political and socio-cultural environments makes comparison of little pertinence, but what they all have in common is their blind acceptance and following by their peoples and the consequent debasing of their different countries' institutions and democratic checks and balances, which these rulers invariably nulled and voided, either by outright suppressing them or by putting them at their unquestioned service. A serious, dis-passioned and objective questioning of such a posture is perhaps the film's major contribution.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Perfect Downfall,"Downfall is, like Das Boot (1981), one of the best movies about WWII in Europe - a great production, a great cast and directing make the last days of the 3rd Reich tangible for the audience - without Kitsch or too much lecturing. And last but not least, the great performance by Bruno Ganz as the Fuehrer, Adolf Hitler, refine the work.Great and fantastic, and in comparison, one can see how mediocre and bad that last Oscar-awarded Kitsch by Mr. Nolan (Dunkirk) is.Downfall: outstanding and almost perfect, like Schindler's List, Das Boot, and a very few other movies on WWII, which are not just action-driven war movies..",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
downfall stands-up,"Downfall: Two and a half hours in the company of Hitler was never going to be easy going. But this film was so powerful it had you glued to your seat not noticing the time. Bruno Ganz (from 'wings of desire' (a favourite of mine)) gives a career performance as Hitler. He is so like him you could almost be watching a documentary. Which is what I did the night after I'd been to see it. You see I learnt some stuff at school and then some stuff from other films. But downfall made me realise I didn't really know enough, so the history channel it was for me and after several documentaries on old Hitler's rise to power and subsequent slaughter of thousands of innocent people, I was ready to think a bit more about this film. It is well directed, acted and shot, but the real controversy is in the fact that it shows Hitler as being in some respects quite normal. Nice to his dog, secretary and the children of fellow officers everywhere. He is shown as a frail old man with a bit of a temper. Don't get me wrong he is shown also as the monster he almost certainly was but I think its easier for people to understand the terrible things he did if they can somehow make out he was just pure evil. A bit like does the queen use the toilet? Of course she must but people don't see it that way. The fact that Hitler ate sensibly (vegetarian) didn't drink or smoke, loved art and was a good speaker, wouldn't warrant much hate against him. But to think off him as a cold-blooded killer helps us to kind of accept that he happen to kill 50 million people. The film is trying to lift the mask placed on Hitler by everyone. And in a way it does, it is slightly pleasing to see his end when it comes, and along the way it raises some very interesting questions. It is as much a psychological study of power and corruption as it is a war film and I think it should be shown in schools everywhere.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
"Yes, it's good.","Very well-crafted film about the final Nazi involvement(s) of World War II. The viewer is taken (unflinchingly) behind the scenes of the Nazi administration.The film moves over all the major developments of the fall of Hitler. This is a triumph of scripting and editing from the production team, as it covers a lot of ground without rushing, and also without compromising dramatic structure.The film's attention to detail is excellent, as is it's clever cross-section of the War's effect on different protagonists - from a civilian boy to Hitler himself.Never boring, not going for cheap shots, and excellently filmed, this is the most competent take on WWII I have ever seen.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
