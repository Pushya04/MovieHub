"TIFF07, review 3: Facing the blind deaf stone aloneInto the Wild","Sean Penn's new movie Into the Wild arrives on the wave of a well-regarded novel about a college graduate who decides that the anger and violence in civilized society is too much to handle and commences a journey through nature in order to truly live life as it was meant to be. This film is a wonderful glimpse into the life of a kid, wise beyond his years, and the bonds that he creates with people along the way. A victim of excess in wealth and a shortage of love, Christopher McCandless hid inside his mind behind knowledge and philosophy, building up his intellectual strength, as well as the physical, in order to complete his trek, ultimately leading him to Alaska. Penn never falls into the trap of showing too much heartbreak on the side of McCandless's parents, because he doesn't want the audience to second-guess the decision he made. There is no debate to be had here, our protagonist has no alternative but to get out and live off the land. Only being completely self-sufficient can he grasp a meaning for his life and one day perhaps go back with that knowledge fully learned.Emile Hirsch is absolutely brilliant with his good-natured attitude and affable charm. His character believes that human contact is not necessary for happiness and never seeks out relationships. However, his character is so likable that they find him and latch on, not to change his mind, but to experience his level of being and hopefully learn something from him and help enlarge his vocabulary on life. The people he meets help him to fully grasp the decision of life in the wild and be able to survive it. Never coming off condescendingly to those he crosses paths with, Hirsch always holds a smile on his face. One scene, where he meets up with a couple of people from Europe, proves how contagious a clear outlook on life without the troubles of societal restraints can be. These three kids have a blast, if only for a few minuteswith Hirsch being chased by the police for rafting with no licenseand it makes one wonder if maybe we all should take a journey into nature and feel the freedom and full warmth of heart that a lack of stress to succeed in the business world can give.All the supporting players are magnificent at helping show the side to McCandless that Penn needs on display to succeed. Hal Holbrook, Brian Dierker, and Catherine Keener are by far the best of these side characters with Vince Vaughn and Kirsten Stewart adding some charm too. Dierker, Keener, and Stewart play hippie, flower-child type roles and allow Hirsch to show off how modest and unselfish he is. This is the family he deserved to have from birth and he is the son they wished their lives had earned them. At their best, all four together give some of the most emotionally charged moments in the film. Holbrook, on-the-other-hand, helps give insight into the philosophy that Hirsch needs to live with in order to survive the loneliness, looking him in the face, to come in Alaska. It is truly fascinating to see how every person adds something to his overall experience and to the tools he needs.Hirsch deserves a lot of credit because he truly outshines the film itself with his dedication and sacrifice to the role. The length of time needed to allow him the ability to lose the weight necessary for a main plot point in the movie is crazy. If the time wasn't that long and Hirsch did it all rapidly, I'm even more impressed. With all that, there are many instances free of dialogue that he needs to carry with body language and actions alone. True, much of this is enhanced by a wonderful soundtrack from Eddie Vedder, but evenso it is a remarkable performance. Kudos to Sean Penn for a gorgeous filming job also. He captures the countryside with grace, while infusing many moments of visual style by slow-motioning glimpses, knowing when to show the family left behind, utilizing informative and essential voice-over, and even breaking the fourth wall. When Hirsch first looks into the camera, at the audience, it does not seem unnatural in the slightest, but instead an amazing link for the viewers to take a look into his soul like those that crossed his path have. McCandless is so pure that it almost feels like glimpsing the calm protectiveness of God.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Biography"
Touching,"Stunning scenery, brilliant directing from Sean Penn, soulful songs from Eddie Vedder, and a remarkable, true story. Christopher McCandless (Emile Hirsch) is a college graduate from an affluent upbringing who decides to abandon his possessions and money and to live life out on the road, ala Jack London or Jack Kerouac during parts of their lives. He's a fascinating character because of his idealism and his nonconformity; he's intelligent and kind, and yet he doesn't value human relationships, preferring solitude and a deep connection to nature. Hirsch plays the part very well, displaying an easy, personable warmth but at the same time a determination to go his own way, damn the consequences. He also really looks the part, including scenes where he had to lose quite a bit of weight. His character is troubled from an upbringing that was riddled with strife, and in one moments says so simply (and sadly) ""Some people feel like they don't deserve love. They walk away quietly into empty spaces, trying to close the gaps of the past,"" and yet we get the feeling that is just one aspect of a complicated and yet simple guy.I think some people are turned off by what they feel was a glorification, but I didn't feel that way at all. We see the trail of tears he leaves behind him, with his parents and sister devastated by not hearing from him, and him ignoring some of the kindly advice he receives along the way. He is also brutal to an old man (Hal Holbrook) who so very generously offers to adopt him, in what is a fantastic scene. Holbrook is also brilliant when he tells the young man ""when you forgive, you love."" We see him take risks which pay off (kayaking down a rampaging river), and of course others which do not (going into the true wild of Alaska without a map or enough preparation). For that he is sometimes vilified or mocked, but I admired him for not conforming like the rest of us, and for living life on his own terms. He certainly was not cheated. And in the end, he has his moment of realization, that ""happiness (is) only real when shared"", which is a moment that is incredibly poignant.I loved the literary references in the film, starting with the title card quoting Byron, which seems so perfect: ""There is a pleasure in the pathless woods; / There is a rapture on the lonely shore; / There is society, where none intrudes, / By the deep sea, and music in its roar; / I love not man the less, but Nature more...""And at the end as I thought about McCandless's life, I thought that this passage from Thoreau was nowhere more suitable: ""Why should we be in such desperate haste to succeed, and in such desperate enterprises? If a man does not keep pace with his companions, perhaps it is because he hears a different drummer. Let him step to the music which he hears, however measured or far away.""",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Biography"
Real American Beauty - an exceptional movie,"I've never posted a comment regarding a movie but feel compelled to after attending a screening of Into The Wild at the Toronto Film Festival last night. I won't speak to story here as it's covered in the other comments.This is a movie of real beauty. It made me cry. I felt moved in a way that happens very rarely. It was an inspiration.The feelings it evoked were all based on the power of the acting and the writing. The words were real and human. The relationships seemed real and human. This may not seem like a great feat - but I consider it a true rarity. It didn't feel calculated and artificial, like so many movies (read: Crash - but I'm not here to bash that...). It was very organic, natural and (I can't say it enough) just beautiful. Cripes, it's making me sound like a hippie, for heaven's sake. This for me was Penn's best work since Indian Runner.What it reminded me of...Terence Malik - Herzog? - in a strange way Cassavettes? - Hal Ashby (more Coming Home than Harold & Maude...) - even a bit of Ken LoachRuby in Paradise - Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore - Five Easy Pieces - Easy Rider... but when I list those it's not because of plot similarities (though there are some) or style (although I think you can definitely see the influence of some great films) - it's again because of the heart of it. I heard a few people at the screening comment that the film was ""too long"" but I don't agree. I think exploring a journey of this magnitude required visiting all of the people he touched and taking the time to see the land.Hal Holbrook was just perfect, as was the cast as a whole, and I think Emile Hirsch is really going places - he was fantastic and he owned the role. Eddie Vedder's music worked perfectly as well - not distracting or quirky - just a part of the whole.The film received a standing ovation and quite a few tears were shed. Magic.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Biography"
Justice done.,"The sensitivity with which Krakauer captured the essence of McCandless and his adventure is extended aptly to the movie format by Sean Penn. Even if one might not be able to appreciate the purpose for Alex's journey, I don't think anyone would be able to deny that Into the Wild is a sensitive and poignant cinematic experience. There are scenes in this movie that one will never be able to forget, particularly the ending sequence. This movie will easily pull its audience into a philosophical debate for the truth about who was right and wrong isn't easy to distinguish. Sean Penn certainly doesn't try to answer those questions, questions that McCandless' life left for his family and the rest of us. Penn does well to tread a delicate objective but not indifferent line. Certainly the best movie of this year and one of the best ever made. The story, the story itself is great.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Biography"
"Beautiful Film, Even Better Than The Book","For a movie to be even better than a good book is no small feat. Yet, that's how I felt after watching this film. It really impressed me. One of the reasons is the fantastic cinematography. Man, this is a beautifully filmed and, at 142 minutes, there are a lot of great scenes to admire.Sean Penn directed and Eddie Gautier was the Director Of Photography. I can't stand Penn as a person but fair-is-fair and I think he's great as a director, having seen his work in ""The Pledge"" and ""The Crossing Guard."" The main actor, Emile Hirsch, who plays ""Chris McCandless"" (a.k.a. ""Alexander Supertramp"" reminded me of Leonardo DiCaprio with his looks, build and voice inflection. He is very credible as the young guy who wants nothing to do with materialistic society and dreams of living in the wilds of Alaska. The problem was that he was unprepared and underestimated what he was up against.Two people who fascinated me the most in here were two extremes, age-wise - Hal Holbrook and Kristen Stewart. It was really great to see the veteran Holbrook (""Ron France"") again. He was about 82 when he made this film and hadn't acted in a film in a few years. He was terrific, too. He had some of the most memorable scenes in the story. Meanwhile, teenager Stewart was captivating as ""Tracy Tatro,"" who had a crush on ""Alex."" This young woman is on her way to stardom.Brian Dierker and Catherine Keener also were really, really interesting as the aging hippie couple, ""Rainey"" and ""Jan."" I kept thinking, I know this guy when listening to Dierker's voice, finally guessing it was Jeff Bridges underneath all the beard....but it Dierker, a guy who rarely acts in films.Knowing the book, the only part of the film that caught be off-guard was the young Swedish couple. I don't remember them in the book but I'll never forget this in this film!! One could debate the pros and cons of Chris McCandless for hours, so no sense going into that here. I thought the film was pretty kind to him. You read more in the book about how he hurt a lot of people with his silence. Either way, it's a a fascinating story and a beautiful film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Biography"
Captured his essence,"I read the book in 1996. Like others, it moved me profoundly. I created a series of prints of my interpretation of Chris. I haven't read the book since.This film transported me right back to the spirit that Krakauer brought to life in the book. I spent a few years traveling alone from 1994-1996. This film reminded my why I left and why I returned. Ten years later, all grown up with all the crap, I'm haunted again by Chris. What a well done job.Thank you Sean & John. You did it right.By the way, try to catch Holly Figueroa's song ""Dream in Red"" inspired by Into The Wild.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Biography"
"Real Life, Love","Honestly let me just say this 1st Sean Pean made this story come to life, true life in every moment in the film. This movie has nothing wrong with it, it is perfect in every way shape and form. He did something that brought me to something I never could understand of what either i have to do or what i need to do in my life. If you want a movie from the heart this is it, if you want a movie of love this is it, if you want a movie with real life emotions well this is all of them. Its long but you'll probably want more when you don't want to leave your seat and just live in the moment of they story. So from my heart to yours this movie will speak to you know matter what.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Biography"
A most unique...but not entirely pleasant viewing experience.,"There is a certain irony to the story from ""Into the Wild"", as Hollywood, the land of excess, does a film about a man who got rid of all his possessions in order to live simply off the land. It would be like me (at 250 pounds) writing a diet book! Now I am not attacking Sean Penn or the film or any of the ones who made the film...but in general I just cannot associate Hollywood with the life of Christopher McCandless!The story begins with Chris graduating from Emory University, a prestigious school in Georgia. Now you'd think he would be on the fast track to financial success...but instead he gives away nearly everything he has and heads into the wilderness to live a bit like a nomad. It seems Chris was tired of a life of acquiring things and wanted to live simply...and mostly alone. He also seemed to be running away from himself....or at least who he and his family were.
Ultimately his life would take him from the American Southwest all the way to the wilds of Alaska. This tale is based on a true story, as told by Chris' sister in the film.I think this is a movie where I enjoyed the style more than the story itself. I liked the simple style, the simple music and the mostly lesser-named stars in the picture. I also respect how much Emile Hirsch put himself out for the role...his weight loss throughout the movie was dramatic. As a trained therapist, however, I couldn't help but think the Chris would have benefited a lot from therapy before taking such a huge leap in his life. He was clearly, in an odd way, suicidal and I was concerned how the film seemed to romanticize this.
Overall, an interesting but often unpleasant and overlong movie...worth seeing once but not a film I'd rush to recommend.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Biography"
2008's Version of On the Road?,"Who Is Chris McCandless? A true supertramp? An obsessive, emotionally damaged egomaniac? Suicidal thrill-seeker? A Kerouac-like drifter addicted to the search for an ever-evasive truth? A high-functioning schizophrenic? The 21st century youth culture reincarnation of John Gault? Or just a kid going through a difficult time and looking for some distance to sort it all out?Sean Penn's pop-philosophical examination of this young man's voyage across America, to Alaska, and to the depths of his young soul will give you an interpretation at least. While it is not clear exactly whose interpretation we are seeing, it is very clear that Penn respects his subject and gave this film about as much thought and power as he could inject it with. And the film did remind me of something very true about the self-righteous naiveté of youth.I am not concerned at all with the accuracy of the film, and, while it is tempting to compare this film to Werner Herzog's excellent but less fictionalized ""Grizzly Man"", the subjects are really too widely disparate; Herzog and Penn's perspective on humanity is too different to produce a meaningful comparison. The targets of this comparison, too big and too easy. But I will make one comment about the two films - Penn's film is much more or a tribute to its protagonist than Herzog's.I found Into the Wild to be a gripping, thoughtful film. The script was good, but sometimes a bit pretentious - occasionally crossing the line between character development and character worship. Penn's direction and cinematography are masterful. The acting - every member of the cast included - is absolutely excellent.Recommended - but not for light cheerful entertainment.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Biography"
Oscar material,"I watched this movie on the aeroplane after searching through the movie list and not finding anything else interesting to watch. I didn't even know what the film was called until the ending credits. However, what I saw was amazing - the acting and scenery was excellent and the plot was thought provoking. More people should watch this to appreciate the message to us all. I was also surprised to see it was was actually a true story which made it even more interesting (I love films that are based on true stories). It is one of the best movies i've seen that portrays the contrast between a materialistic world vs the natural world that is at the core of the universe. This is a film that can easily be overlooked but not forgotten.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Biography"
Good but not great,"Good, but not as great as it is made out to be. Great scenery and cinematography, like a National Geographic documentary. Great soundtrack by Eddie Vedder. The central plot is very interesting and thought-provoking, but it gets done to death. From a point the movie just drifts. A shorter, more focussed film would have been much more watchable.Emile Hirsch is great in the lead role and really unhabits the part (down to the emaciated look). The supporting cast are a Hollywood who's who - William Hurt, Hal Holbrook, Catherine Keener, Marcia Gay Harden, Vince Vaughn, Jena Malone, Kristen Stewart.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Biography"
Culture Is Mechanical,"Culture is an ethereal abstract thing you can't quite pin down, and yet it's such a pivotal player in our life. Culture is the context for almost everything you do especially everything we do socially with other people. Chris Mccandless understood that consciousness is purely a solo activity. You can't increase consciousness through culture. Your ability to self-actualize will only come down to your inner work. Consciousness will not grow in a group environment because it produces all the classic mechanical symptoms of a cult. Fundamentally society is trying to take consciousness, and trying to distribute it to the masses through a culture mechanism, and that always makes it mechanical. It suffocates consciousness, and that's the problem.The most significant cult you got to be afraid of is not those little cults it's the massive cult. The superset of all cults which is almost entirely transparent to you and it feels just like reality. It feels like it couldn't be any other way.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Biography"
Exceptional in every possible way,"Sean Penn's Into the Wild is beautiful, staggering, thoughtful, a labor of love made by a filmmaker with real passion for the story he set out to tell. Like a Terrence Malick picture, Into the Wild transcends any conception such as ""if you only see one film this year"" and goes beyond the very notion of ""Oscar-worthy"". If one really has to say something on the subject, then Into the Wild should have shared the Best Picture award with No Country for Old Men, but that kind of thinking is besides the point because Penn's masterpiece is more than a movie, or a work of art for that matter: it's a life experience.A rebel at heart, Penn clearly identifies, at least on a few levels, with the film's unconventional protagonist, a bright young boy named Christopher McCandless (Emile Hirsch), whose astounding true story was first recounted in Jon Krakauer's book which gives the picture its title. Christopher had it all: loving parents (William Hurt and Marcia Gay Harden) and sister (Jena Malone), excellent grades and a most promising future. Then, one fine day the 20-year old college graduate decided that wasn't really what he wanted, took his law school fund and disappeared, setting out for a journey to the heart of America. ""I'm going into the wild"" the self-renamed Alex Supertramp wrote in his journal, and though he occasionally ran into people (Catherine Keener, Vince Vaughn and others) he would connect with in a deeper way, that's where he really belonged: away from civilization, just him, his elementary tools and the pure, untarnished nature surrounding him.Christopher's journey, which is carried out with just the basic resources one needs to survive (no cell phone or other gadgets), is a modern odyssey of sorts, a quest for something that was lost forever and won't be found in the near future. In a world like ours, where technology rules all, a choice like Christopher's would be met with disbelief and probably derision. That only heightens the intensity of the character's message, which is also what the director aims to tell us: we need to rediscover ourselves before it's too late. It doesn't matter whether we are young or old, as the protagonist touchingly teaches an elderly man (Hal Holbrook, the only cast-member to be nominated for an Oscar), the important thing is we give it a serious try.To simply call this a film isn't enough: in one of the most amazing combinations of efforts in the history of movie-making, the story, Penn's soulful direction, Hirsch's painfully real performance (will he ever be this good again?) and Eddie Vedder's elegiac songs (an essential soundtrack for any true film-lover) merge into something that's almost too powerful to describe in words: you have to see it to believe it.Into the Wild isn't an ""easy"" film: it will leave you very affected, possibly devastated, but also as enriched as one can ever be after seeing a genuine masterwork. It will ignite real thoughts about life instead of the phony reflections so many ""issue movies"" try to induce. It will hit the gut, the heart and the mind in equal measure, and once the initial wave of emotional overflow has passed you will feel immensely rewarded. Into the Wild does this because it isn't merely a motion picture: it is art, life, freedom and nature, all together in a mesmerizing piece of visual poetry.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Biography"
An epic adventure! A masterpiece of a film!,"How can you describe a film like Into the Wild? One of the greats & by far my favourite film of all time. The only film I have ever seen which manages to capture the true spirit of adventure. The beauty of Into the Wild for me is that what Christopher McCandless is running from is never as important as what he is running to. Sean Penn has directed this film with magnificent precision and imaginative grace. Every scene, every image used in this film tells it's own story and the countless people Chris meets along the way are as magical and integral to his journey as his survival in the wilderness. I love the beautiful simplicity of this film and how it has captured nature in both it's breathtaking and dangerous forms so perfectly.Emile Hirsch is a sensational actor and helps make Into the Wild what it is. His acting is totally believable, and the story often trips along with him silently acting, using nothing but his body and facial expressions to put across emotions and thoughts. A perfect cast alongside Emile, including the likes of Jena Malone, Catherine Keener, Vince Vaughn, Kristen Stewart and Hal Holbrook, all help make Into the Wild an enjoyable watch.Into the Wild has a very special quality to it, something which I can't quite put my finger on. It is a culmination of things, from the beautiful imagery, the fantastic script, the amazing cast, the often mesmerising quotations and of course the feeling of adventure and of true freedom. It is a unique vision into the life of a young man searching for himself in a dangerous environment who comes to realise that the true meaning of happiness may not be what he first thought. I highly recommend this film. It is one that will stay with your for a long long time.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Biography"
I didn't enjoy,"The film is the film of the sons fleeing to find a way for himself because of the completely artificial actions of their parents, thinking that they can only be happy with materiality, and seeing themselves as superior to other people.The young man runs away. He spends his happiness sometimes working in the fields, sometimes hanging out with the caravans. But its main purpose is to mix with nature completely. Until he reaches his goal, he catches the real family warmth in the people he meets. However, he reaches the wild life where he wants to survive and find happiness with a thousand difficulties. There, plans don't go as planned.I watched the movie because it was highly praised to me. But I didn't enjoy it very much. The inconsistencies within the family were distressing. Parents have always wanted to fulfill their wishes in their children. The wealthy and successful family, perhaps the dream of many, meant the meaninglessness of life for that young person. The fact that it's a real life story makes it even more impressive.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Biography"
An excellent film that tells the life story of a controversial adventurer of our time.,"I went to see this film without reading much about it, driven by curiosity. It is an excellent film, although it is difficult to see, and the main character has ideas, attitudes and motivations that can be discussed. Very well directed by Sean Penn, the film tells the life (brief, since he died very young) of Christopher McCandless, a.k.a. Alexander Supertramp. As the film shows, he was from a wealthy family and had a good education, but he carried with him the revolt against his abusive father and his passive mother. Then, he acquired a lot of disdain for capitalist, materialistic, consumerist society in which he never saw himself: burning and giving his money, abandoning everything that was not essential, he left his old life behind and started to wandering, as a vagabond, in the middle of the wild, before moving on to his great goal: Alaska.Much more than the film itself, it is the figure of Chris McCandless that proves to be fascinating: he could be seen as a utopian idealist in search of a dream, a spoiled young man angered against his family or a traumatized man, fiercely determined to purge his past through destructive self-denial. Personally, I admire his iron determination, the way he did not hesitate to venture out, against all odds and, not infrequently, against all good sense. But I admire that because I would never have the courage (or perhaps the recklessness?) to imitate him. In any case, he is a figure who will remain controversial and will certainly continue to raise questions and attract fans and critics.I really enjoyed the work of Emile Hirsch for the film. The actor worked hard and gave himself completely to the character, not hesitating to dispense the help of stunts and to lose weight until he looked like a war survivor. He truly embodied the character and gave us an excellent dramatic job. Beside him, there is a wide and interesting range of supporting actors who brighten up the film: Marcia Gay Harden, William Hurt, Catherine Keener. In some brief but important characters, we have the easily recognizable names of Vince Vaughn and Kristen Stewart. Much more remarkable and interesting, Hal Holbrook's work in a philosophical character that only appears for a few minutes, earned him the nomination for an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor.Technically, the film has several points worthy of praise and positive mention, starting with an excellent camera work, which makes the most of the natural beauty of the filming locations, and a great cinematography where light and shadow are magnificently used. It is a very long film, but the editing work was excellent, and I felt that the story told fully justifies the two and a half hours in length. The sets are good (especially the bus) and also the costumes, particularly that of the main character, with his hair and beard giving him an increasingly wild, sloppy look. The makeup team's work also deserves a note of praise for the way it left Hirsch's face particularly emaciated and pale for some scenes.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Biography"
The Tragic Journey of a Spoiled and Selfish Dreamer,"Chris McCandless (Emile Hirsch) is the son of Billie McCandless (Marcia Gay Harden) and Walt McCandless (William Hurt) and older brother of Carine McCandless (Jena Malone), When he graduates from Emory University, he has grade to join Havard. Instead, he gives the savings for charity and decides to travel to Alaska to live in the wilderness using the alias Alexander Supertramp. Along his journey, Alex meets persons that supports and like him. But he proceeds with his of hermit with tragic end.""Into the Wild"" is a long and overrated film based on the true story of the tragic journey of a spoiled and selfish dreamer. After graduating, Chris McCandless decides to leave his life of petit bourgeois, his family, his possessions and achievements because he has two childhood traumas: he learnt that their parents were not married when he was younger and he witnessed their arguments. Therefore, it is an unsatisfactory explanation for such drastic attitude. Chris does not send news to his parents since he hates them. But his sister suffers with the absence of news from her brother and he is so selfish that he does not call or write a letter even for her. Another strange point is no reference to drugs in the hippie camps. Therefore, the story is unpleasant and weird as a drama.

A masterpiece,"Sean Penn's artistic contribution to cinema in my lifetime has been staggering.

From start to finish it is beyond inspiring - by the end, it lifts right off the ground.The first time the soundtrack really kicked in, I felt that Eddie Vedder's score seemed too loud.

Didn't Find This Movie Remotely Moving,"It's too bad that I saw Werner Herzog's amazing documentary ""Grizzly Man"" before I saw ""Into the Wild."" One can't help but be reminded of Herzog's film while watching Penn's, or the fact that Herzog's is so much better.Both films have as their focus troubled young men who travel to the Alaskan wilderness to escape a society in which they feel they don't belong. Both men have persecution complexes of a sort, and feel that there's something noble in their efforts to commune with the wilderness. But ""Grizzly Man"" is an objective, journalistic account of Timothy Treadwell, and Herzog's fascination is with the obsessions that made him tick. ""Into the Wild,"" being a fictional film, is already once-removed from the real-life story of Christopher McCandless, and director Penn piles on so much bombast and padding, that the impact of the story becomes blunted under a veneer of pure Hollywood studio.My biggest obstacle in liking this film is that I didn't like the character of Christopher, nor did I like Emile Hirsch, the actor who plays him. McCandless, who gives himself the moniker Alexander Supertramp once he's set off on his odyssey, is an arrogant 20-year old who thinks he has the world figured out, and woe be to anyone who tries to tell him otherwise. His psychological troubles stem from the emotionally (and the movie suggests at times physically) abusive environment he grew up in. His parents are played by William Hurt and Marcia Gay Harden as cartoonish caricatures of Southern aristocracy; his sister, played by Jena Malone, is the only one who Christopher believes understands him, and her character provides the film with one of the most thudding voice over narrations I've ever heard in a movie. We get it -- he shuns the materialistic world as a way of shunning his affluent parents. But a two and a half hour movie built around a kid learning a lesson that many of us already knew going into it makes for a mighty tedious movie indeed.That lesson, learned too late, is that human companionship makes life worth living, and that happiness means very little if you have no one to share it with. Many recognizable actors show up throughout the film as strangers Christopher comes across and develops fleeting relationships with, and all of them have a chance to pontificate. The trouble is that all of them (especially Catherine Keener as a hippie and Hal Holbrook as a lonely old man) are so much more interesting than Christopher himself that we wish the movie would stay with them and let Christoper be on his merry way.This movie really copped out as far as I'm concerned. Everyone Christopher comes across is gently understanding of his plan even if they try to discourage him. Not once does someone tell him that his actions represent supreme cowardice and hypocrisy. If he was so bothered by the state of society, why didn't he do something productive to help change it rather than run away and hide? Maybe this is the point Penn was trying to make, but I felt like Penn himself couldn't decide whether Christopher's behavior was foolish or admirable.I feel like I was meant to come away from this film moved by the tragedy of a life wasted. But I wasn't moved at all, nor did I find it all that tragic. ""Grizzly Man"" -- now THERE's a film that moved me.Grade: B-",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Biography"
I have to say Oscar Material.,"I have to say Sean you did buddy. This movie is ultimately awesome!! We need more films like this. I had the opportunity to see this film last night and I loved it from the very beginning. The cinematography was absolutely awesome and breath-taking. If more people would worry about other human beings rather materialistic things we would be in much better environment. I truly believe Happiness is SHARING as well. When you see a ""HOMELESS"" looking person, or someone who doesn't have what you have, you should NEVER judge how they got there. I have to tell you this movie really touched me and makes me want to live more to the fullest to make a difference and to be a better person.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Biography"
This movie makes you think of your life,"This is a great movie, which makes you think of your life. I don't know why did I cry so hard when I saw this movie. Maybe the character Christopher (Alex) resembled my own life. And I think, it resembles the life of every guy to a certain extent, as everyone of us go for escapism at some points of our life due to various pressures. This movie shows the life of a man who leaves every thing, absolutely everything and go for an ultimate and pure escapism, and what does he learn and realize at the end. With awesome Eddie Vedder's track throughout the movie, this movie is enlightening as well as entertaining and a very important movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Biography"
Sean Penn's breakthrough as a director,"With ""Into The Wild"" Sean Penn achieved something that only few actors from his mold have succeeded in: he proved himself a worthy director independent of his acting laurels. ""Into The Wild"" is just so good, that it blows the last bits and pieces of doubt away. Penn is not only directing this beautifully, he also managed to write a screenplay for a three hours movie about a guy who basically just wanders around in the wild and then starves, without ever slowing the movie down so much that it becomes boring. Sure, you have to be in the mood for this (and it's best to see it in a cinema, I guess), but if you really let yourself in for ""Into The Wild"", you'll be deeply touched by the story of this remarkable young guy who chose to live by his own rules and by his own rules alone.There's not one weak link in the cast and Sean Penn directs all the actors to perfection. Emile Hirsch carries the movie. His resemblance to the real Christopher McCandless is uncanny as evidenced by a self portrait of McCandless at the end. What Hirsch did for the role - losing 40 pounds - is reminiscent of Christian Bale's engagement for ""The Machinist"" and speaks for the soul he put into his performance. All the supporting actors - in fact everybody other than Hirsch is a supporting actor here - are great as well: Marcia Gay Harden, William Hurt, Catherine Keener, Vince Vaughn and the wonderful Hal Holbrook. Last but not least Eddie Vedder's soundtrack adds a lot to the haunting atmosphere of the movie.""Into The Wild"" is something that won't let go of you after you've left the cinema and it might actually make you rethink your principles in life. I applaud Sean Penn for realizing his vision so well and hope to see more of him in the future. By him, actually.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Biography"
Must see by one and all,"Sean Penn has done what so few screen writers have been able to do; take an impeccable book, and make an impeccable movie from it, while retaining the integrity of the original story. The cinematography was first rate and Emille Hersch' performance was jaw dropping. Pay attention academy. I can say honestly, as an insider in the movie industry and as a general fan of moving pictures going back to the zoetrope, this was the best movie I have ever seen. Go. See. It. Take your family, take your friends, take you co-workers, take your yogi, fly your peace corps cousin in from Chad and take him. Just go see it. But more importantly than just sitting there and watching it; take something from it. Walk away having a new outlook. Realize thats its people like Chris McCandless that keep the human spirit alive, and that this facade we have created around us...its not real. Go, live.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Biography"

Special quality to this film,"The beauty of Into the Wild for me is that what Christopher McCandless is running from is never as important as what he is running to. Sean Penn has directed this film with magnificent precision and imaginative grace. Every scene, every image used in this film tells it's own story and the countless people Chris meets along the way are as magical and integral to his journey as his survival in the wilderness. I love the beautiful simplicity of this film and how it has captured nature in both it's breathtaking and dangerous forms so perfectly.Emile Hirsch is a sensational actor and helps make Into the Wild what it is. His acting is totally believable, and the story often trips along with him silently acting, using nothing but his body and facial expressions to put across emotions and thoughts. A perfect cast alongside Emile, including the likes of Jena Malone, Catherine Keener, Vince Vaughn, Kristen Stewart and Hal Holbrook, all help make Into the Wild an enjoyable watch.Into the Wild has a very special quality to it, something which I can't quite put my finger on. It is a culmination of things, from the beautiful imagery, the fantastic script, the amazing cast, the often mesmerising quotations and of course the feeling of adventure and of true freedom. It is a unique vision into the life of a young man searching for himself in a dangerous environment who comes to realise that the true meaning of happiness may not be what he first thought.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Biography"
"The best movie in a long, long time.","I knew nothing of Christopher McCandless or the book of his life or even anything about this movie until I was sitting in the cinema. The only thing I knew is that Sean Penn was directing and having been very impressed with his gut-wrenching, if incredibly downbeat, The Pledge I was pretty much guaranteed to like this film. My guess turned out to be extremely correct.Alexander Supertramp (that's Emile Hirsch as McCandless folks) is a man with no attachments. Having been raised in a loveless household by parents who only wish for him to 'or-din-ary' things he entertains them as far as graduating college but escapes to the country as soon as the diploma is in his hands.His dream is to explore the land with no ID, no money and no chance of being found by those who might want to interfere with his mission of reaching peaceful seclusion in a remote corner of Alaska. Along the way he touches many lives, some brief, some profound and gains experience and character that some might never have even if they lived to a hundred.Sean Penn's photography and affection for nature give this film an overall gorgeous look. It is surely one of the most uniquely composed films of the year. He reminds me a lot of Clint Eastwood as an actor who can also direct fine movies and encourage impressive performances out of his cast. Pretty much everybody here is on top form, even Vince Vaughn manages to shake off the taint of those tawdry 'frat pack' comedies and play a genuine character for once.But Hal Holbrook as old Ron Franz really is a standout. I've never seen a more heartfelt or touching performance in so long. If he doesn't earn an Academy Award come Oscar-time then there ain't no justice in the world. I think it's great that Sean Penn brought Holbrook (now 82) back for such an important and thought-provoking role. If you don't shed a tear for him then you have no soul.Don't con yourself out of a good movie. It may have a limited release but Into the Wild is a film worth taking time out to see. Since I live in the UK, the story of Christopher McCandless (which appears to be some sort of true urban legend in America) is not well known here. I guess that having no expectations of the film made me enjoy it on the right level. Definitely something I will be tracking down on HD DVD when it's released.PSI broke my tooth while watching this movie.

An epic American adventure,"Of all the animals shown in this movie: The Kodiak Bear, the Grey Wolf, the Bald Eagle, the Moose etc, only one has the ability to make dreams.... that animal is man.From director Sean Penn, Into the Wild captures in detail one of the defining features of the human species; to be able to have a dream, and the desire to fulfill it. Despite a somewhat clunky two and a half hour running length (which may feel loger depending on how old you are) Into the Wild is an adventure that becomes one with the viewer. It is a demanding project but the work has paid off nicely, and I'll raise my glass to it for that.Into the Wild is based on the true story of Christopher McCandless. After graduating college as an A+ student in 1992, he chose to leave his materialist society and stuck up family behind. He chaged his name to Alex Supertramp, and embarked on a quest for Alaska. On his journey, he covered thousands of miles of American wilderness, on foot, by train, car, kayak, meeting a plethora of weird and wonderful people along the way.It is absolutely vital for the movie that the character of Chris/Alex is one whose company we can enjoy. After all, his journey is ours. Emile Hirsh's performance is definitely sufficient. He is a little wacky but in a good way. He is also talented, bold, determined, and fun to be around. I suppose it is also worth noting that he has a pretty face.A movie like Into the Wild is also demanding on the crew. After all, the storyline covers about half the country, which of course means lots of transportation is needed, and lots of landscape imagery. The camera is all over the place, referring of course to locations (not movement). Into the Wild is a gorgeously photographed picture, which is backed up with a great song score from Pearl Jam's Eddie Vedder. I remember a couple years ago during Oscar season being annoyed that his songs were snubbed, because of eligibility rules.My one problem with the movie, is that the editing feels a bit tripy. Into the Wild frequently plays with time in a Pulp Fiction manner, and some of that time concerns flashbacks related to family melodrama. These scenes are conveniently short but they don't seem important enough to be worth showing. I suppose it's also worth mentioning that the last half hour could use a few trims.No movie is perfect of course, and no human being is perfect either, it is not until the end of the film when we realize that about Chris. But I'll say this much, the journey was worth it, and if you can spare an hour and a half for Into the Wild, I think you will agree with me on that.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Biography"

I felt it when I saw the world premiere of Crash three years ago, in the exact same theater and I felt it once again watching Into the wild.Emile Hirsh gives a gripping performance as John McCandess, at times it felt as though I was watching an incredible documentary. I never once though of him as an actor portraying a character but instead it almost felt life like! He deserves Mr. Oscar and so does Penn just for the stunning imagery alone.Hal Holbrook melted my heart and his performance brought tears to my eyes- he is incredible, yet maybe shared 15 minutes of the screen time.

Unfulfilled promise,"I was disappointed by Penn's film adaptation of Into the Wild. On the positive side, I found Catherine Keener's performance as Jan Burres completely convincing. I enjoyed the Vedder soundtrack, and I thought certain cinematic elements were beautiful (though not always serving to the storyline) such as the night shots in L.A. However, there was a lot a didn't care for. The voice over narration by Carine McCandless (Jena Malone) didn't work for me because the story was not hers to tell, and the narration together with the rapid cutting within scenes and the frequent temporal shifts left me unable to identify with either Chris McCandless (Emile Hirsch) or the viewpoints of the characters that Chris met along his way as I was able to do with, for example, the supporting characters in Agnès Varda's Vagabond (1985). Being unable to identify with any of the characters, I was left in the position of an outside observer and here Penn failed to make much of this position either. For example, Penn did not use the camera to show us anything that Chris failed to figure out. Krakauer's book makes clearer that the magic bus was not as isolated as Chris believed it to be, and that the seasonal river that cut off Chris's planned departure route could have been crossed upstream. Penn could have unobtrusively shared this information with the viewer, but chose to withhold it for the purpose, I suspect, of romanticizing Chris's adventure.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Biography"
Mr. Penn's Grand Opus,"Deeply thematic, the story of a young man's wilderness experience is rendered compelling because the events really happened. Non-fiction is usually more potent than contrived fiction. And in this case the story's climax packs quite a dramatic punch. Mostly as a result of how the story ends, viewers are bound to come away with strong opinions about the idealistic protagonist, Chris McCandless, and his quest for truth. As such, ""Into The Wild"" works, but only because the real life events force you to think.That said, it's been quite some time since I have endured a movie wherein the film direction was so annoying. You would think that Director Sean Penn would fashion a low-key, restrained film in sync with McCandless' disdain for money and showy materialism. No such luck.Penn constructs a two and a half hour grand opus, bombastic in tone and smug in its philosophical righteousness. The main character is portrayed as some modern day spiritual guru endowed with miraculous insight. Penn hangs on every word the guru says. The film's plot structure is unnecessarily convoluted as if to suggest profundity. Camera work is gimmicky and flashy. And the soundtrack is overbearing. In short, McCandless' genuinely moving real life story provides the opportunistic Penn with a chance to display his flair for showmanship.With all that ostentation and excess, the film screams out for recognition. It's as if Sean Penn is campaigning for every cinematic award in the books. I would thus argue that ""Into The Wild"" is not so much about Chris McCandless as it is about ... Sean Penn.I normally like outdoor adventure stories and films based on real life events. But I found this film something of an ordeal to sit through. The basic story is quite compelling. And much of the film's scenery is gorgeous. Both casting and acting are quite acceptable, especially the performance of the always reliable Hal Holbrook. But the film's direction is so distracting in a tacitly self-congratulatory way, I don't think I could sit through it again.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Biography"

A Sad and Beautiful Tale - But It's A Bit Boring...,"Like most films based on a true story, I expected this film to be slow-paced, and I was not surprised in any way.Whilst the overall feeling of the piece is one of loneliness, I got the impression that the main character could and should have gone back home in the end. He stayed out there too long, in my opinion.It was wonderful seeing all the people he met, and seeing how he affected their lives, and how, indeed, they affected his. But he didn't seem to learn anything from the people he met, apart from various trades and skills. If he'd only stopped to listen to them properly, he might have been happier than he ended up.Enough about the character himself, though. The music to this film is terrific. Eddie Vedder, of Pearl Jam, wrote all the music, and did a sterling job, as usual.The ensemble cast is very good, and are directed well by Sean Penn.This film really showcases the natural beauty of some parts of America, and indeed, the beauty of some of its people.Overall, this film is sad, beautiful, yet boring. It drags on a bit, and because the subject matter hardly changes (ie a lonely man travelling up and down the country, meeting people) it is very samey. It's worth watching, but do not expect to take any important messages away having watched it, other than the importance of family and friends.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Biography"
Society - you ugly breed,"Sean Penn directed and wrote an excellent film about a young boy named Chris (played by Emile Hirsh) who literally gave away all of his money and went off on an adventure to try to identify with himself and leave behind the world that he couldn't fit in. During the adventure he relates to many people that help guide him to his long journey to Alaska where he will live alone Into the Wild.Perhaps it's the fact that I can relate to Chris's character myself where I feel like I can't live like everyone else with the 9 to 5 lifestyle. The pressure of everyday beats down on you where you just want to leave everything but don't have the courage to do so. I consider Chris McCandless a hero and perhaps one day I can break out of this shell and be free just as he does in the film.Eddie Vedder's soundtrack was perfect for the film. I'll admit that Pearl Jam is my favorite band (I wish I could see Rats live), but it doesn't mean that Vedder could screw up a film. In this case, he was completely on. The song society is my personal favorite. The lyrics are right on to the film's message.All the supporting performances were great. Vince Vaughn (not being a fan) was the biggest surprise to me as he was very good for the role. You'll see other familiar faces such as Catherine Keener, Marcia gay Harden, and Kristen Stewart.

Beautiful,"Into the Wild (2007)**** (out of 4)Sean Penn's magical film based on the life of Christopher McCandless (Emile Hirsch) who after graduating college donated his life savings to charity so that he could go on a tour year tour of the country, which would leave him alone and dead at the age of 24 in the wilderness of Alaska. With both The Indian Runner and The Crossing Guard Penn showed signs of greatness but both films were highly flawed. With The Pledge he showed that he could create a masterpiece and he's done that yet again with this film, which is one of the most refreshing, spiritual and magical films of recent memory. I guess you could call this a message film but that might be an insult since the movie is so much more than that. I'm not sure I could put into words all the meanings behind the movie but it certainly makes you think about your life as the character is doing as he's going on with his journey of trying to find something, which he might have had all along but just didn't notice it. Penn's direction is terrific throughout as he tells the story of this young man and the director doesn't hit a wrong note throughout the 150-minutes. The music score contains classic songs as well as new acoustic material by Eddie Veddar and really captures the mood and freeness of the film. The cinematography is downright beautiful from start to finish and really captures the beauty of the various locations. The greatest thing are the performances, which are all very rich and certainly worth of Oscar talk. Hirsch goes through a lot of changes both physically and mentally and the actor perfectly captures all of this. The way he goes from the free child to simply a child lost in the world was incredibly touching. The supporting performances are just as great and features William Hurt and Marcia Gay Harden as his parents, Brian Dieker and Catherine Kenner as a hippie couple and Vince Vaughn as a hard drinking man who gives Hirsch a job. Hal Holbrook is also very touching as an old man who realizes that he hasn't fully lived his life after tragedy hit him. As with Penn's previous films, this is a very serious look at life, love and the meaning of it all and the director doesn't pull any punches. Penn has been given credit for being one of the greatest actors of his generation but he's quickly becoming one of the greatest directors out there. This isn't a movie for dummies as it forces the viewers to think and there's not a better movie out there for that.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Biography"
An emotionally wrenching story of the unforgiving lesson of nature,"(My Synopsis) Based on the true story of 22 year-old Christopher McCandless (Emile Hirsch) a.k.a. Alexander Supertramp, gives his entire savings to charity after he graduates with honors from Emory, and begins his journey and great adventure into the wild. Chris believes that he can life off the land and that he doesn't need any money to do that. He had a goal of testing himself to the fullest by heading into the wilds of Alaska and surviving alone. It took Chris about two years to finally make it to Alaska, and along the way he meets a series of colorful people that he had never before encountered through his privileged life. His quest to learn more about the American culture took him from the wheat harvest in South Dakota to a kayak trip down the Colorado River into Mexico, and Slab City, California, before he finally makes it to Alaska. Once in Alaska, Chris must battle for his life against the harsh reality of nature in an abandoned bus.(My Comment) This isn't a happy movie, but it is an emotionally wrenching and thought provoking story that will make you think. It is about our society, family, idealism, and nature; most of all it is about the romanticism of youth and the tragic consequences of an unforgiving and dangerous wilderness. Chris left everything behind to find something pure in the world, or the meaning of life, or just himself by pushing the limits into the wilderness. During his two wandering years, Chris learns from every person he meets and adds something to his overall experience and the tools he will need to survive. The only problem with that is Chris went into the wilderness without ample preparation. Too little knowledge and experience will get you killed, especially, in Alaska. Considering Chris' intelligence and resources he had with him, it seems that he was very foolish, naive, and youthfully stupid.While Chris was in the ""magic bus"" the movie takes us back and forth in time and explains his dysfunctional family life and his earlier travels during his last two-years. I would have preferred the movie be shown in chronological order and not with so many flashbacks. Emile Hirsch gives an absorbing, completely believable performance as Chris. Hirsch deserves a lot of credit, because he sacrificed and gave of himself to the role. Hirsch lost a lot of weight during the movie to show that Chris was starving to death, and Hirsch will probably receive an Oscar for his performance. It is a long movie, so get ready for it before it starts, because you can't leave your seat until the very end. The story has a tragic ending, but it was beautiful and profound at the same time. At the end of the movie, they show a picture of Chris that was taken by him in front of the bus, and we see that Hirsch resembles him, which is uncanny.

where are all its Oscars?,"1.) Sean Penn is an outstanding actor, however his directing skills in this outshine any performance he has given. Emile Hirsch gives an outstanding performance (something hard to come by in such young actors) in this emotionally life changing film. I don't know why the academy did not recognise it or why Hirsch has not been approached by other filmmakers for his staggeringly good acting skills. 2.) The cinematography, location filming and art-house (but not too surreal) direction is perhaps the best I've seen, ever. 3.) The story is true which makes the film even more powerful and emotionally charging (cryable). 4.) The co-stars are all outstanding despite not getting a lot of screen time. 5.) before this film I had never heard of how Chris macandles gave his life's savings to charity and went into the wild.

Strong Movie With Major Flaws,"10 November 2007. Until the overly, emotionally wrought-movie's ending, INTO THE WILD held little in the way of redeeming value. Though gorgeous and visually stunning, Sean Penn is pretentious and overly excessive in his use of photographic and cinematic techniques. He unnecessarily tries to impress the audience with his apparent ability and knowledge of all the variety of camera work available to him. Unfortunately, the diversity and various uses of his art become a distraction in themselves and sometimes become story instead of the background. This jarring distraction becomes particularly apparent during the scene where Christopher McCandless visits a love tourist stop. In this scene Penn uses an almost documentary-style visual approach to the scene that is completely different from other styles he used in the other portions of the movie. It's use appears to more for showing off than really contributing to the story of the movie. The frequent scattering and non-linear, flashbacks, flashforwards isn't always a pleasant trip, making the audience having to twist and turn in ways that really detract from the main themes of the movie. Instead of allowing the audience just to immerse themselves into the story, they are forced into a roller-coaster ride of almost dream-like snatches of experience that never truly gel into a satisfying experience. Never is the audience allowed to truly grasp the depth of the McCandless' parent's transformation, from their beginning to their ending. Vince Vaughn, probably, has the most authentic, and delightful role in the movie, where his acting is on full display that eschews any of Vaughn's typical character stereotype. The fascinating threads that Sean does present are interesting with their continual focus on relationships throughout the movie that McCandless is exposed to. But unfortunately, these threads never truly succeed in revealing McCandless' depth of relational experience. For example, there are lukewarm inferences of emotional tragedy or regard with respect to McCandless but in another scene from another movie demonstrates how much is lacking in Penn's presentation of McCandless as a character's own emotional trial and self-absorption. In Dr. Zhivago (a book that McCandless actually reads in the movie) the audience is allowed to linger in a haunting scene of Dr. Zhivago's love leaving his life forever in a sleigh that becomes smaller and smaller until it's just a dot on the horizon before fading completely away as Dr. Zhivago desperately tries to climb up into the house's top window and look out at the last glimmer of his love life. The jet airplumes in INTO THE WILD, are much more effectively used in 24 Days After, a movie where a biological contaminated Britain is wiped out and it is only the airplumes overhead that suggest (not as in INTO THE WILD of civilization to runaway from) but civilization that saves. There is the moose killing that is so disrespectful of nature and the land. There is the reckless disregard for taking responsibility of freedom, taking advantage to not conform to the rules of society. Most of the movie appears to be an over-glorification of the wild, rugged, individual man seeking his own identity and freedom, yet, it avoids the more harsh realities that McCandless also likely experienced along the way, except for the very ending.

(1) Brilliant film (2) the protagonist and his story is simultaneously inspiring and idiotic,"Sean Penn and crew did an excellent job here. Cinematography and editing are great and real locations are used to full potential. Emile Hirsch is phenomenal and Hal Holbrook also really stands out. Special mention of Brian Dierker, acting for the first and (so far) only time, as Rainey: a feat even if he IS basically that character, because getting in front of a camera instantly turns most of us into anything but who we naturally are. His chemistry with Catherine Keener is stellar and the two are part of the film's heart and soul.Supertramp's journey is compelling in many ways, whether followed by book or by film. But there's much polarization regarding whether Alex/Chris was a visionary prophet of the road (or, at the very least, a free spirit on a Thoreau kick) or an utterly self-indulgent moron. I'm one who emphatically sees him as BOTH, and then some.I grew up in settings that allowed me access to a lot of outdoor experience, including formative years living at an outdoor-pursuits center where my parents worked. Thus I had easy entrée to outdoor activity and the tools with which to hone skills necessary to survival in the wild, to deal with things when it all goes wrong (as it surely will) without freaking out excessively and letting panic doom me or anyone else. I also saw for myself that Nature is wonderful and Gaia-licious but that she really doesn't care if we live or die; I see the natural world with both a 'romanticized' and a very pragmatic, survival-based eye, both being part of the truth.My whole life's involved study of Nature, including years of field research experience (PhD in ecology) diving on coral reefs in far-flung places on the edge of the blue horizon. Did I have near misses with my own mortality during that time? Sure did. Was I 'adventurous'? Well, yeah, in terms of having what might be called 'adventures' in exotic places around dangerous animals (I studied one for my doctorate). I have also more than once hit the road and vagabonded, the longest such bout being at age 20 back in the '80s. So, yeah, I can relate very strongly to Chris' drive, and to what he felt out there on the edge, where you never know from day to day where you'll be at nightfall and, indeed, even if you'll be alive. It's simultaneously exhilarating and scary.The BIG difference between someone like me and someone like McCandless, though, is that he went flat-out against the wall at every turn, rashly leaping into things way above his head. You can only get away with that kind of thing so long. If I 'have an adventure' I know my capabilities and where they start to fade. It's risk management. Some of what such people do may look bold and brave but you can't tell, from looking, what they're REALLY doing: if they're well trained and aware of the risks and their environment they may actually be playing it quite cautiously within bounds of experience and ability. Film stunt players are good examples, too: what looks totally out of control is actually carefully planned (well, ideally) and rehearsed by specialists. Pushing boundaries is fine but in doing so you want to control the risk you know is there; you may still mess up, but at least the fall may be survivable.Sometimes you have the adventure and sometimes the adventure has you. The idea is to minimize that last possibility. You must know what you KNOW and know what you DON'T know. Young Chris was woefully unprepared for many of his adventures, pushing boundaries without knowing what they really WERE, careening off boundary after boundary. It's amazing he made it as far as he did. On one level I salute him for that, and admire his zeal and passion, but on another I recognize him as irresponsible and self-centered. He was a sensitive, intelligent, self-indulgent young man with a mind full of pithy quotes and concepts from Literature who failed to see past the most superficial of those lessons and parables. He was an idealist, and I can appreciate that, but he forgot that we all have to get by in the real world and that cost him everything.Is he the sage hero some proclaim? Well, if his story inspires you, go emulate his ideal but PLEASE first learn a thing or two about what your journey might require. I'm disconcerted to find a whole Internet subculture that basically worships Chris and his folly. Idiots. Chris' death was unnecessary and stupid, but a likely outcome. He basically failed to remain humble in the face of Nature. Whether clueless or arrogant, that sort of thing doesn't make for happy endings. His should be a cautionary tale in this aspect, not an inspirational one.Regardless, as a film this succeeds on every level; a masterpiece. If it was mythology it'd be just as powerful. Sean Penn comes uncomfortably close at times to painting Chris as Jesus-like, the Magic Hobo, but he does at least acknowledge the cruel effect of Chris deserting his parents (and his sister) and the final realization that his journey's epiphany was, thanks to the Nature in which he sought to immerse himself, impossible to realize. The film also shows that, for all Chris' vaunted self-sufficiency, throughout his travels he relied on help from others, many portrayed as surrogate parental figures: the clues to his final realization were there all along, every step of the way. When he finally found what he wanted it did him no good because he could not go back again. Forget all the back and forth over whether Supertramp was a wise wanderer or a self-indulgent little jerk, really, because this consideration is a timeless thought, and this film manages to convey a few of those.Excellent job, all involved. Rest in peace, Christopher Johnson McCandless.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Biography"
A masterful piece of film-making,"""Into The Wild"" is my favorite book. I was hesitant to see this film, but felt if anyone could do this remarkable story justice, it would be Sean Penn. I was not disappointed. This is a heartbreaking story that does not wallow in pathos. It is a tribute to those among us who march to a different drum. Maybe some viewers will find Christopher McCandless' story pointlessI've heard the hubris arguments alreadybut for those of us who have felt the lure of absolute freedom, the love of unspoiled nature, and the need to find our souls, ""Into The Wild"" is awe- inspiring. Penn's screenplay is succinct and smart, his direction is flawless. The performances Hal Holbrook, Catherine Keener, and Marcia Gay Harden chief among themare superb and Oscar-worthy. But it is doe-eyed Emile Hirsch who is the heart and soul of this film. With so many grand performances swirling around him, he's easy to overlook. But don't. His joyous and painful portrayal of McCandless/Supertramp is a tribute to the real McCandless' innocent spirit.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Biography"
Not as profound as it might want to be.,"Into the Wild has a slightly student film maker feel to it. The editing, the music, the choice of camera angles, the constant constant cutting feels very experimental. After a slightly annoying title crawl we get into the film. The picture looks very clean, sharp and bright, we follow a lone character on his travels in Alaska, it's only him so you know there's not going to be much dialogue. When the dialogue does come it's pretty banal, it's quite realistic, the kind of thing an idealistic 23 year old would probably be coming out with. Despite being a film about the great outdoors we actually get quite a lot of tight close up shots. Also the early part of the film is much more focused on the people he does meet rather than his solitude and isolation. A nice aging hippie couple spend some time with him and we learn more about his background. The son of a rich but dysfunctional family, our character gives away all his money, destroys his ID papers and sets off on a trip across the country to explore it's wild parts. You'll have to make your own mind up about the character. Is this a spoilt rich kid off on a self indulgent trip, unwilling to knuckle down and take his future seriously. Or is he an idealistic, adventurous and open minded young man, keen to avoid the consumerism sweeping the country. The idea though he doesn't need any money is not really affirmed. He takes on many low paid jobs to help fund his travels, he's no doubt a bright boy with a bold vision of how life ought to be. He meets many other travels on his ways, all of them friendly and harmless. It's around his parents and in the big cities that he feels unhappiest it seems. There is an awful lot of voice over too, and after a while it gets a bit repetitive, quite a lot of it from his sister is mostly going on about how amazing, how clever, how talented, how advanced he is, it all gets a bit hero-worship like after a while. Some of the cinematography and editing too is really dated, I hate split screens in a movie, it doesn't feel very cinematic at all. The appeal of freedom and natural beauty though is understandable. Quite a lot of the story is told in flashbacks before we finally get to the end on the ""magic bus."" At over two hours the film is too long. Kirsten Stewart is also in this film which is a nice bit of trivia now.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Biography"
The Mistakes of Youth,"A film with three viewpoints. The narration by the sister of ""Alexander Supertramp,"" (the character of Christopher McCandless played by Emile Hirsch), the Supertramp himself, and the unspoken perspective of the Supertramp's parents.The story: A disillusioned, intelligent college graduate realizes that he can not tolerate ""society."" As a result, he decides to dump his money, dump his car, and travel, as a tramp, losing himself by looking for himself. He heads, in a round-about-way, for Alaska where he can live alone.Supertramp's sister provides various narrations throughout the film trying to understand why he disappeared as he did -- and gets it -- after reflecting on their family life together.Not examined is the parental perspective -- worried and concerned -- at times fearing that Chris is dead, but not wanting to bear the fact that he wanted to disappear and they are or were at least partly to blame.While the film is enjoyable as we follow the adventures of Chris, it is unbearable to see this story from the parent's mindset. Chris is selfish, self-centered, and immature, and never thinks of how his parents may feel not knowing whether Chris is dead or alive, suffering somewhere alone, hungry or sick.Chris makes some mistakes living alone which eventually kills him -- wasting his life, devastating his parents and causing a great deal of sorrow for his sister.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Biography"
This movie changed my life.,"This is my favorite movie. When is saw this movie for the first time,i was totally shocked that somebody left his family without knowing where he is.
I like the music so much i bought it on cd.June 21 2015 i left the Netherlands and went to America to do the trip that Alexander (Alex) Supertramp did. I visited the locations and ended of course in Alaska. During my trip in Alaska i met a girl named Sarah that looked very much like Tracy Tatro in the movie. She played guitar and could sing like Tracy. We visit together the location of the movie bus and we went to the nature three days walking from the real bus that still is in the nature. She left back to Anchorage to go back to San Francisco where she lives. I walked three days to the real bus that is stil standing in the nature. When i was at the location of the bus i slept in a tent for three days close to the bus. After that i walked more in to the nature to be alone for a week. It is strange to be alone for a week,i even started talking to myself. After my trip in the nature i lifted back with people to Anchorage. I had the greatest time there.When i left Alaska i went back to San Francisco to see Sarah. We started a relationship in the last three weeks that i was in America. In August 2016 i stopped working in The Netherlands and said goodbye to family and friends,because i was going to live in San Francisco with Sarah. August 21 2016 i left The Netherlands and went to Sarah. After three days Sarah told me that she lost her job and went back to her mother to live there. I stayed in a hotel close to her mothers house but after a while we realized the relationship was over.From that moment i thought what really makes me happy? The only thing that came up in my head is traveling around the world. I went from San Francisco to Las Vegas,Canada,Mexico,England,Ireland,And much more countries. I travel now for almost three years without seeing my family and old friends. Some people call me selfish for leaving my family and friends. I still have contact with family and some friends using e-mail.Traveling makes me happy now for almost three years. Christopher Mccandless quote is:Happiness is only real when shared.

Shocked,"I don't usually watch movies like this, but I walked into a room last and it was on. I honestly had no idea what I was looking at except that I saw Vince Vaughn and Emile Hirche (I'm sure that is spelled wrong). Into the Wild was spectacular, breathtaking and compelling to say the least. I sat and watched it with my home girls and we were all three enthralled by it. The messages behind the movie, the acting done by Johnny Truelove, it was outstanding. The only thing I'd ever heard of the movie is that older gentleman was nominated for an Oscar, and it's a shame he didn't win it, I was pushed to tears at the end of his performance. I highly recommend this movie to anybody, its a movie to make you think about your life. I was shocked.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Biography"
"No phone, no pool, no pets. No cigarettes.","I can only imagine that there are many others, like myself and Chris, who want to be free of those ""irksome obligations,"" and just take off. Unfortunately, most, like myself, will never do it. The story of Chris is a vicarious thrill for me.I was anxious to see him head to ""slab city,"" ever since I saw Plagues and Pleasures on the Salton Sea. It has been one of those places I wanted to explore. But, that had to wait as he headed for South Dakota. It didn't matter where he went, there were outstanding scenes to experience and great people along the way.I have to say that Vince Vaughn really impressed me in this film. This is not the Vince Vaughn that I do not like.Rather than wait 12 years for a permit, he just took off down the river. If he hadn't he wouldn't have met Sonja and Rads.Finally, Salton Sea, and Rainey and Jan (Catherine Keener) again; and Tracey (Kristen Stewart).

An excellent choice for a movie party!,"Most of the negative reviews around Into The Wild focus on two things. The merits or otherwise of Chris McCandless and the accuracy of the story. Whilst I can understand a degree of frustration at the addition of at least one fact to romanticise the story and the man, I feel sad that some people are so judgmental of others that they cannot enjoy what is a truly beautiful and thought provoking film.At best the protagonist was brave and principled. A voice all too infrequently heard as society careers ever more headlong towards pure materialism. A man who understood that the health of the soul and the clarity of understanding his place was of utmost importance. At worse he was a selfish, ignorant and pretentious brat. A man who was so wrapped up in the tough cards life had dealt him that he unconditionally abandoned the one person who loved him and had been dealt those some cards. A man who failed to recognise that for all the relative pain he had gone through in his adolescence, he also had been given the intelligence and opportunity to really do something with his own life.This is what makes Into The Wild first and foremost such a satisfying story. It shouldn't matter which side of the fence you fall, so long as you can appreciate the polarising nature of the character. My emotions towards him swung wildly with the narration of his sister and then seeing the positive effect he seemed to have an everyone he met on his travels. I don't judge him for his foolishness; I think life has judged him quite enough for that already.Of course none of that covers the beautifully captured scenery, pitch perfect soundtrack and wonderful pacing of the film. The two and a half hours flies by despite the episodic nature of the story, thanks to the inter cuts between the magic bus and what led to it. Emile Hirsch does everything he needs to as the lead and the supporting cast fall in behind up wonderfully. Of particular note are William Hurt and Marcia Gay Harden as the parents and Catherine Keener who maximises every second of screen time in her portrayal of the roaming hippie, haunted by the reminder of her estranged son.There are few films capable of prompting debate quite like Into The Wild and that is a thoroughly fine trait to have. Plus it's a damn enjoyable watch.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Biography"
An amazing film - one of the best.,"This was one of the most powerful films I have ever seen. It changed my outlook completely and it helped me to appreciate the most simple things in life. I first became interested in this film because I heard that Emile Hirsch was cast and I am a huge fan of his work. I believe he's an excellent actor and I can see his career going from strength to strength. I then began to learn about the true story of Christopher McCandless and his life. I have read articles from those that knew him and from what I have read Sean Penn has portrayed this young mans life down to a tee. The acting, filming, scenery and Eddie Vedders fantastic soundtrack are all amazing but the story itself is what does it. A mans strict refusal to be lured in by the evil in society leads to an epic journey of Self Development, proving that real strength lies within. This film will not only entertain, it will inspire.

Long journey into isolation,"Shortly after his graduation from Emory University, we meet Christopher McCandless, a bright and adventurous twenty something who sets out on a long journey through America to try and find contentment. Various flashbacks provide insight into his reasons, which are hidden secrets from his families' past. Along the way, he meets a series of colorful characters, who help to shape him, and create the crux of the movies narrative. He finds in these people what he thinks he's lacking, which is family; yet he never stays put for long. His heart set on Alaska. This film is a solid and fascinating road tale, but doesn't provide enough backstory to explain to the audience why he is so motivated to completely uproot his life, give away his possessions, and move to the wild of Alaska. So it's fun and quite interesting across it's run time, but we never truly understand this wanderer, Alexander Supertramp. Only brief glimpses into his past give us any insight, and we never escape the feeling his story deserves better. Fascinating, but incomplete. Emile Hirsch does well with a complicated role. The support is wonderful. Recommended, but somewhere in the middle.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Biography"
Good true story,"Good true story! To simply call this a film isn't enough: in one of the most amazing combinations of efforts in the history of movie-making, the story, Penn's soulful direction, Hirsch's painfully real performance (will he ever be this good again?) and Eddie Vedder's elegiac songs (an essential soundtrack for any true film-lover) merge into something that's almost too powerful to describe in words: you have to see it to believe it. Into the Wild isn't an ""easy"" film: it will leave you very affected, possibly devastated, but also as enriched as one can ever be after seeing a genuine masterwork. It will ignite real thoughts about life instead of the phony reflections so many ""issue movies"" try to induce. It will hit the gut, the heart and the mind in equal measure, and once the initial wave of emotional overflow has passed you will feel immensely rewarded. Into the Wild does this because it isn't merely a motion picture.9'/10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Biography"
Interpretation of Words,"I saved this movie for a special occasion, a time when I was sensitive to the written word.Its because I know Sean Penn and his blind spots. Its because I knew that this will appear as a celebration of a special soul who discovers the purity of life through simplicity, or nature, however you handle this sort of sublimeness.And I knew that it would make me unhappy, because it will have been extremely effective at telling that story, but it is one that I will find unsatisfactory.Why isn't important, other than to say that it demeans the human spirit to pretend it is so thin. And if it matters, it isn't fair to any lost, broken soul like this poor dumb kid to turn his pain into something glorious because we are afraid ourselves.Regular readers of mine know that I get frustrated when there exists a fine reading experience, and then it is made into a book and people think somehow that if the events are conveyed that is sufficient. Its because reading is a sacred thing. Cinema, when handled well, is too. And so is that special state where the mind is attuned to whatever elements of nature you see. Its that attunement, that process, that ""shifting into"" that matters.Penn understands this. He's a serious artist. He knows that this is a film not a story. And it is about the word, the written word, not some likable runaway. It starts well, and with this notion, us seeing the words from his journal in the foreground, the images mere annotation. One of the hardest things to do in film is to start. You have only a few moments to create a world.Throughout, we have a constant battle, a battle of words with images. The images nearly win, or so it seems. The end has our hero escaping the words of the idealistic books he carts around to see, actually see something transcendent. We are supposed to go along.But here is where the words govern, they shape and control. The first level of course is that this is a movie made from a book. It is a book written by a man whose job is to weave the notion that ascetic communing with nature is the purest of pursuits. Its got enough truth and tradition near it to allow it to create a powerful fiction. This boy's life wasn't important or interesting. What made him the target of Krakauer's book, was because he was a writer, and left documents.Its like the great Antarctic Scott expedition who perished for much the same reason, and were celebrated for precisely the same reason: they left compelling journals until they died. So we have Krakauer's words, fabulated and extending the boy's words. And these are based not on any internal vision, but on the words of others who he not only read, he carried books into the wild instead of food.So three layers of words, each one stepping closer to an idealism of nature while using notions and media further removed.The final irony of course is that he dies because he misread a word in a reference book on edible plants (as it happens in the film).Words matter in this film. They control the story as they run into the wild and incidentally carry this guy and the others he encounters, all obviously written not born. Penn could be a really important filmmaker, and here he comes really close to making a film about the compromises of film.Penn has only a few times where he crosses the line for me. They all have to do with the segments concerning the parents. One is particularly egregious. We are told that his dad was a smart enough man to be hired to engineer communications for NASA satellites. When we are told this, we see a NASA-supplied clip of a rocket being launched. That clip and its cousins have been seen countless times and is semiotically loaded. Its a shorthand for ""high tech"" whatever that means. Its a problem for two reasons.One is the simple rule of overshowing. The cinematic effects here depend on the visions coming from the outside, slowly permeating that shell of consciousness. Penn does fairly well on this, avoiding the Carroll Ballard effect of human-manufactured natural ideals. But it depends on consistency, and he breaks it here. It takes a good 20 minutes to recover.But the other problem: the irony is that satellite communications isn't about rockets and power. Its about isolation, desolate vacuums, sterile modes, the inability to touch. It also happens to be cinematically accessible through some other stock footage, and when appropriate, folded into the images of winter and bus... and writing.Emile Hirsh is very good. He's been now in three expertly edited films, and I mean truly cutting edge.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Biography"

Worth it for Holbrook's cameo alone,"There are two types of people in the world. Those that would watch 'Into the Wild' and admire 'Chris' for living out his dream, and those that would watch 'Into the Wild' and see his actions as reckless, selfish and pointless. I fell more into the latter camp. I understand the burning desire some people have to do similar things to this, however as much as you may hate your family it is pretty cruel to intentionally put them in such a position. This is a good movie but I think it is based around flawed logic.I'd been meaning to see this film for nearly 13 years now. I always wondered how they had managed to spread the story of a man going into the Alaskan wilderness by himself into a two and a half hour movie. What I hadn't realised is that very little of the film is actually spent in Alaska. It is more about his journey to get there. Along the way he meets countless people who influence him in one way or another. This was probably my favourite part of the film. Seeing each little interaction and how it affected him. The final one with 'Ron' (played excellently by the Oscar nominated Hal Holbrook) was by far my favourite aspect of the film.The things that kept me from flat out loving this movie were probably the runtime being about 30 minutes too long, a feeling of the story drifting on occasion and also a lack of drama or tension for extended periods of the runtime.

An Inspirational Adventure,"This was truly a great movie.

As it goes on parts of his journal that he kept on his travels are read out and analyzed and attached to the meaning of his quest. It's a beautiful perspective on why we live and how to find true untainted happiness simply by being a part of nature and real life, as opposed to the social conditioning we have become used to.There are parts that will make you think hard about your own life and how you can make yourself happy. In the end however, Chris is on the verge of starving, and he realizes that ""happiness is only real when shared"". This part nearly brought me to tears. It is an intense moment of self reflection and understanding of one's place in the world. It is in a way a reversal of the initial goal of Chris which is to find happiness away from society, and explains the fact that happiness is in fact created by society.Sean Penn is a great director. This movie had some of the most beautiful cinematography and landscape scenes I've ever seen. At some points you may be awed by the simple beauty of the earth without even having to understand that this was what Chris wanted.The acting is magnificent. Emile Hirsch is great, especially towards the end when Chris begins to be paranoid and disillusioned by his hunger. You can feel his joy throughout the movie and understand why he set out on the quest, as well as feel his remorse and pain when he comes to the realization that what he searched for may have been closer than he thought and not in the hills of Alaska or other locations.Overall, this is a great movie.

"Into the wild, a controversial art-house film about searching the truth in life.","INTO THE WILD.Into the wild, a controversial art-house film about searching the truth in life. Jon Krakauer's Into The Wild which I read, tells the story of a 20-year-old graduate called Chris McCandlles (Emile Hirsch). Who donates his entire $24,000 savings account to charity. And abandoned his valuables and starts to live into the wild. Director/Actor Sean Penn prepared nearly 10 years before starting to actually shoot the film. Sean Penn's film adaptation stays close to the source. As a director Sean Penn exposes his ability in directing and absorbs the audience into a melodramatic emotional and truthful story.Into the Wild combines two popular genres, the road trip part where Chris takes distance from the achievement society to search for the real human being. And the struggle of man versus the ruthless nature in Alaska. Into the wild is narrated by Chris his sister called Carine (Jena Malone). Carine expresses the feelings from her brother in contrast with her parents. Chris heads west, and burns all of his identification cards. He is now known by his nickname "" Alexander Supertramp "". While hitchhiking Chris encounters a hippie couple (Catherine Keener, Brian Dierker) and gets in good company. He learns and shares with them, before moving on. By the time Chris is nearly out of his money. He meets Wayne Westerberg (Vince Vaughn) a grain harvester who gets in trouble about his suspicious activities. Chris heads west, his sights now resolutely set on Alaska as his final destination. He re-encounters the hippies and bumps into a young girl (Kristen Stewart). It makes me wonder about the sexuality of Chris. At his last stop Chris is asked to be adopted by a lonely, aging man performed by Hal Holbrook.Chris leaves the request with reference to adoption unspoken as soon as he travels towards Alaska. For Chris It's the journey, not the destination what matters. It's an admirable attitude to life, in what manner Chris creates a fellowship amongst the persons who come across his path while traveling. Every individual who knew Chris understood his notion and loved him. Aimed at Chris, the trip to Alaska is what giving him happiness and pleasure. Chris settled himself into an old coach and survives from what the wilderness dedicates. Emile Hirsch has a very difficult job of taking a character that has been wounded by his parents and the society. Searching for what contents life, but as a result he won't find what he's searching for, because "" Happiness is only real when shared "" as Chris wrote in his diary. The way in which this film is shot is absolutely wonderful, the cinematography represents the story magnificent. In some cases they broke the cinematography rules to provide the look for what it needs, to express emotions, circumstances and the right atmosphere as well as the editing.Into the wild is a long motion picture, clocking nearly 150 minutes. And is oriented on different subjects which makes it interesting but also exciting for what the next chapter will bring. I definitely learned a lot and I admire Chris in his belief, vision and strength. Emile Hirsch acted blameless even as the supporting actors, with a drowned performance by Hal Holbrook and not to mention director Sean Penn.Written by Max Houtman",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Biography"
"When you forgive, you Love","...When you forgive, you Love And when you Love, God lights paths on you...Learning the meaning of ""happiness sharing"" ,Emile Hirsch get on this running away from society and family searching the wildest side of his soul. The deepest connection with nature. The meaning of life. Along the road he'll find out many friends who took care of him and helped to go to the north. Alaska was calling.The movie is interlaced with past scenes regarding Alaska trip, and scenes regarding Alaska living life. The interlacing gives rhythm to the movie and make it far behind a boring slowness that had could ruin the great atmosphere of the entire work that reaches an holy calm and sense of freedom.Since Seneca years (3 BC-65 AC) trip were used helping soul becoming healthy, and now more than then we need to find our selves, where society pushing everyday to control everything, many sensible human being could suffer lack of freedom more than others. I think that everyone have had or will have an experience like that. It is not necessary to go to Alaska, but wherever is good to find our personal light inside us. Our truly self.I think that the movie meaning is much below the appearance. Emile Hirsch sacrifice his self to make everyone has watched the story understand the limits of meaning research. ""Sharing happiness"" and ""reconciliation"", kinda like the gospel of the lost child. He didn't succeed in turning back to forgive, his path had a cruel and lonely ending...but probably we find ourselves when we forgive, and once we forgive, we can go back and solve our past. Forgiveness is related to Love, and Love is related to life. Just forgive and sharing happiness. That is what I learned from this movie, that I can tell...it made me pouring a drop at the end, an unexpected one by the way...I advice everyone watching it, better alone,in a calm and lonely place, you must feel into the wild! Hopefully this could be an inspiration for someone else future thoughts!Roberto, Milan (Italy)",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Biography"
Just my opinion...,"In my opinion. For whatever reason Chris felt that relying on possessions was a weakness. I will not digress on that subject because it is for each person to understand in there own way. Chris chose to live his life almost completely free of relying on objects that in theory are useless to finding happiness and being content with life. This does not mean those who do not live this life are wrong, but instead just shows that the human spirit, body, and mind are the true source of fulfillment in life. This story is a beautiful inspiration on how life can be perceived. Chris' journey INTO THE WILD was so, physically and emotionally and he stretched his limits past all typical boundaries and then some. I applaud his commitment and will.

Into the Wild: A Movie About Love and Finding Yourself,"Into the Wild is like a journey through beautiful Alaska that hits you in the heart. It tells a story about wanting to break free and figure out who you really are, something we all feel deep down.The movie shows a person going on a solo adventure, meeting different people along the way. It's like looking at your own life, where you meet friends and learn from older folks, understanding the many sides of love and relationships.The emotional music in the movie adds a special feeling, making you think about your own search for understanding and a place where you belong. Some say the movie makes the journey look too perfect, but it makes you think about your own relationships and how complicated they can be.Into the Wild is like a simple mirror showing your own feelings about love and figuring out who you are.

Into the Wild: Uncompromisingly Brilliant,"Into the Wild is Sean Penn's adaptation of the same-titled novel by John Krakaeur. Filmed, among other places, in the wilds of Alaska where a good deal of the real story it tells occurred, it is a faithful presentation of an interesting tale.The film is the story of Christopher McCandless, a college graduate who becomes disillusioned with the world of upper class life, and goes off into the wild to find something more meaningful in his existence. Meeting many interesting characters along the way and affecting their own views on life, McCandless aims forever toward Alaska, the final point of his lengthy journey.I found myself instantly drawn into this film. The primary element in this effect is the soundtrack. Eddie Vedder creates a beautiful score which chronicles this adventure and compliments the sprawling beauty of the unoccupied landscapes. The visuals of the film are incredible, the natural shots of this better, effulgent world spellbinding. Penn beautifully directs some of the most stunning images that can be captured. Undoubtedly, the film owes all to the main performance. Emile Hirsch creates a character so real, emotional and three dimensional that we cannot help but be pulled into his vision of the world. The voiceovers from Chris and his sister give us a deeper insight into his motivations as the film flickers between our hero in his perfect world, travelling to get there, and experiencing his personal hell at home. All comes together to create a stunning experience which left me breathless and amazed at its power. The strength of the film is impressive, staggeringly poignant and uncompromisingly brilliant. Especially touching, for me at least, was the performance of Hal Holbrook, a genuinely upsetting and tear-jerking addition.With some of the best acting one can ever hope to experience in film, the natural beauty of the Alaskan wilderness forms a backdrop for the genius of this film. Straying from outrightly stating the moral correctness of its protagonist, Into the Wild poises questions which continued to haunt me for weeks and weeks after seeing it. Add a wonderful score, a deeply meaningful story, and a director who obviously believes incredibly in his work, and you have one of the best films I have ever had the pleasure of watching.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Biography"
Completely undeserving of a high IMDb score,"Please spare yourself and avoid this film, it is utterly boring and undeserving of a high rating.This should not be in the top 250. Although the cinematography was of high quality, it does not make up for the two and a half hours of pretentious tedium I had to sit through.The main character is portrayed as a sophisticated critic of modern life, but in reality is just self involved and is seemingly oblivious to the pain and suffering he pointlessly inflicts on the people closest too him.At around the 40 minute mark we all considered (4 of us) ejecting the DVD, and I regret we didn't. Usually I do not bother to comment on films, but in this case I feel it is my duty to save others the pain.",1.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Biography"
Should be watched with the much better Grizzly Man by Herzog,"I like Penn and consider him talented. But for a much better treatment of idealistic and naïve man in unforgiving nature, I recommend Grizzly Man above Penn's flawed, and itself naïve ""Into the Wild.""What Christopher McCandless did was place himself in an area where two kinds of humans manage to stay alive: a) those who bring plentiful food stores for their entire stay duration or transit duration of their presence there; or b) are people with hundred of generations and lifetimes of training and practice in getting barely substance levels of food from the land there.What McCandless did is no different than people who think they can befriend all grizzly's or sharks, cross the Sahara or Kalahari with no water, or for that matter transcend gravity and jump from a plane with no chute.Nature has no benign or malicious spirit, no intent, no spiritual element at all. It is beautiful in the grand and the small, and for the human animal either has sufficient calories or will kill you from starvation, just as the right large predators will kill you.What on earth is Sean Penn thinking? To portray McCandless as something between Thoreau at Walden and Kerouac?No. Thoreau knew his soundings intimately, was a couple hours walk from several settlements. And Kerouac stuck to well traveled roads. McCandliss did not even bother with a map and put himself somewhere where there was no food.Watch ""Grizzly Man,"" which is Werner Herzog's treatment about the same type of pathology, frankly the same type of suicide. Herzog is sensitive to his subject takes us to the edge of romanticizing the self destructiveness, but doesn't cross over.Penn absurdly romanticizes his subject and in fact for anyone who has read the books that stick to the facts, one can see Penn falsifies a lot of key facts as well.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Biography"
A rare pearl: when the word fails to translate emotion,"It's difficult and limiting to review such an emotionally engaging movie: it's a movie that can only be lived and lived again, the viewer just has to let it penetrate into his soul, mind and body. It's a movie that empties you in order to let you be reborn to a new life, at least to a new perception of what life and happiness are, and what has nothing to do with them. The depth and intensity of the experiences lived by Chris, as much extreme as the lands he visits (which provide an ideal and spectacular scenario for them), give evidence of such anxiety of life and truth, which go beyond the mistakes made by the young boy. Chris is, of course, a victim of an age which makes you believe the necessity to pursue the ideal, in an absolute way, never considering the opposite necessity to come to terms with real life, often hostile, misleading, which provides false values of materialistic happiness, but from which escaping is not always the most constructive attitude. However, his escape will prove to be almost therapeutic to him, since only at the very end of his physical, but also spiritual, and very painful, journey, will the young boy be able to understand the preciousness of true human relations, those which make you long for a human being you can share happiness with, as well as any other human feeling. The emotionally powerful soundtrack by Eddie Vedder helps to let the movie enter, gently but inexorably, into the very inner core of your soul, stirring such strong emotion inside, that the viewer finds it difficult to translate it into words. The word, however powerful and deep, fails when trying to rationalize the strong emotional engagement: you just have to allow yourself to be overcome by it and leave words aside, as too limited and limiting. It's one of those movies which really gets under your skin and cannot but alter your vision of life, forever. A pure and rare pearl within the cinematography of this century, and, I would say, of all times.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Biography"

"Failed to live up to my expectations, good film nonetheless","There is a lot to like about this movie, the first thing that jumps at you is the amazing , natural toned cinematography that truly captures the beauty and power of nature. The atmosphere plays a big part to make the movie what it is, all credit goes to
Eric Gautier for filming it with such grace and Jay Cassidy for doing a masterful job of editing.The score by Michael Brook, Kaki King and Eddie Vedder does a good job of coupling with the excellent shots.All the praise aside, the movie really fails to connect and feel coherent. Chris McCandless played by Emil Hirsch can feel relatable, at times everyone has felt overwhelmed by materials, the society and thought about just being one with themselves.The problem is, you cannot help but feel the character just left his sister in a horrible situation with parents that are not really empathic. Also it is really off putting that the character never tries to inspire others to find the value in disconnect from the chaotic city life, instead he just magically always finds helpful people without seeing the other side of life.How can you see the real world without seeing some negativity, finding some evil. How can the core of a man's experience expand if they have never experienced the worst of humanity or even seen a glimpse of it?My favorite characters in the movie ended up being Hal Holbrook who is the only one who benefited from Emil's journey.A good movie with a decent message, but no really a consistent plot that makes all that much sense sometimes.

Freedom in sharing and freedom within...,"Freedom in sharing and freedom within...the very core of ultimate freedom seemed to have been explored.I always enjoyed Sean Penn's raw work as an actor....and was looking forward to see his work as a director.. Also,Emile Hirsch did an amazing acting job.Any actor who gives so much of himself or herself as Sean Penn does, can be exciting to experience when he /she brings to a movie in the direction.I was very pleased to see the movie at the Landmark Sunshine Theater in NYC.Truth is that freedom is so personal and at the same time is in context with the community or nature where that person lives..Truth is often between the lines.We live in a world which is said to be ""civilized"" and yet alienating . Many reasons seem to be the cause of this...thank goodness for films like these to help balance out things..Intimacy is also very connected to the notion of freedom. Learning to be intimate with one's emotions,body , spirit,etc....are a prerequisite to being able to be intimate with others...Others or the environment are sometimes the catalyst that a person needs towards freedom and intimacy . Freedom or at least the notion of feeling free is the fuel to ultimate intimacy. A delicate balance is somewhat challenging but highly rewarding.This movie reminded me of my life experiences ,when I was totally alone in nature, by choice, and what was revealed to me by circumstance... life is truly an amazing gift and the greatest gift is in sharing.Thank you Sean Penn and wish you a continued success in your sharing.Claude Laniado actor/producer/psychiatrist",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Biography"
Too Much Penn - Not Enough McCandless,"Having not read the book, I can only take from Chris McCandless's experiences based on what I saw in the film 'Into The Wild'.As a film I found many extraordinary things about it. The splendid cinematography is the first that comes to mind; many of the performances–particularly Hal Holbrook–who was a stand out and the interesting story/screenplay that director Sean Penn had to work with, which he painted over a broad canvas.I do have some issues with the way it was presented. The narration by McCandless's sister; the passages that flashed across the screen from Chris's letters to Wayne who we really didn't get to know much about in the film and the non linear representation of the story—these things were too distracting for me too get fully immersed in the proceedings. It took me almost a restless hour before I began to settle in and my mind was constantly reminded that I was watching a movie. I feel this is due to Penn's disordered screenplay and self conscious directing style—the actor mugging into the camera??? Being aware of who the director was, I feel that more of Sean Penn's sensibilities and politics came through rather than that of the lead character and has let the film down slightly.The choice of Eddie Vedder to score some of the music and songs throughout the film and the structure of the screenplay appears to come more from Penn's own psyche rather than what could have worked better for the films narrative. I personally feel a more linear/mainstream structure to this film would have benefited the story more. The representation of the themes expressed don't appear tempered or balanced enough—too anti this and anti that. Again it felt like too much Penn coming through.William Hurt and Marcia Gay Harden had thankless roles as McCandless's parents and were wasted screen time. Any other lesser known actors could have portrayed these roles with what little they were given to do; as was with Vince Vaughn's character. Catherine Keener was perfect along with Hal Holbrook and I didn't have any issue with young Emile Hirsch in the lead role.Through the events portrayed in the film I admire McCandless's tenacity and passion for pursuing the life and dream he desired. However, I found him arrogant and deluded not to mention hypocritical in denouncing the so called civilized world into which he was born. Alright! Chris had some childhood/upbringing issues but who doesn't. He was educated; intelligent and loved; but many of his actions— particularly those involving his family appear selfish. After the distressing incident with the Moose, Chistopher McCandless should have surrendered his ego and made an attempt to turn back home. To my mind he is not a hero and does not deserve to be martyred. It was a shame how this bright young mans life ended up - but perhaps his fate was deserved.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Biography"
What an idiot!,"This film is a 1...at best. I will never, not ever, get the time back that I wasted watching this dreadful film. I am completely perplexed as to how this movie scored an 8?! I can only assume that no one else saw the film that I saw. Coming from Sean Penn, I should have known it would be filled with left-wing, anti-government bulls#!t. To be frank, the film is nothing more than the bastard love-child of Dead Poets Society and Grizzly Adams...except suckier.Christoper McCandless was not only a misguided, self-absorbed, self-indulgent youth, he IS the ultimate idiot. There isn't a single quality to admire about him, with the exception of his generous donation to charity. An action, I would suspect this misanthrope made with the sole purpose of pi$$ing his parents off. Simply put, this film is the ""whoa as me"" tale of a rich, spoiled, young man who was TOO determined to prove that the apple sometimes does fall far from the tree. He is completely undeserving of the accolades or screen time he managed to eek out of Hollywood.His ""quest"" for the ultimate human experience cost him his life...and to gain what? I mean, seriously, what it the point of this movie?? It really only leaves questions, for which there are no answers. Most notably, how can anyone...especially someone as educated as he was...thrust himself into the Alaskan wilderness (one of the most remote places on the planet) without doing a little research?? Congratulations Emory, you taught the boy well!!Seriously, all of you who gave this movie higher than a 3, would you really put yourself in the position that he put himself? Would you not have spent some time in Alaska, maybe worked a job to acclimate yourself to the land? Would you not have gotten a little advice, perhaps taken a guided tour and survival courses? Would you not have learned about weather patterns and considered that after crossing a river before the summer thaw meant that you wouldn't be able to cross it when the snow began to melt??No, this yahoo simply asks someone to drive him to the end of the road and drop him off on a trail. Smart buddy! The countdown on your life just began. In truth, Chris McCandless committed suicide and Hollywood pathetically glorified it.Yeah, yeah, I realize he had ""books"" to help him out. Yet, we find out in the end what good they did him. I guess Tolstoy doesn't offer much in the way of how to preserve a moose. Any rational person would have realized they were in trouble months before this guy. ""Hmm...I keep taking notches up on my belt. I am eating every day...nothing but lean protein..but still, I am eating. Yet, I have managed to lose 60 pounds. Gosh, I wonder if something is wrong??""The only redeeming quality of this film is that it does manage to remind us that Mother Nature will always be there to strike you down when you begin to get a little too righteous for her taste. Or, in this case, she will leave you to die, alone, in the shell of an old school bus, surrounded by the philosophical b.s. that put you there in the first place, wasted away in a pool of your own feces.",1.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Biography"

Great movie- can't wait to read the book!,I bought this book quite a while ago but never got around to reading it. I was so excited when I heard it was being made into a movie- especially with the help of Jon Krakauer! The movie is so engrossing that the nearly 2 1/2 hours went by very quickly. Christopher clearly was born too late- he epitomizes what we were like in the 60's and 70's- a time of innocence with a quest for simplicity.

A Perfect Movie,"Literally a perfect movie. The storyline was good. Acting was good. The ending!
Everything was just perfect. I didn't find any fault within this movie.
Many people have mentioned in the reviews that the movie was better than the book. I don't know that for sure because I haven't read the book.The story is about a young boy, who has just got graduated as a top student decides to leave everything behind and live his life the way he wants.
Literally he leaves all his possessions, his family, everything, he leaves his entire society in which he grew up.
In some way he was selfish to do that, to leave his family without a single note or a letter, to have his parents, his sister worrying over him for years.
But on the other hand leaving with no traces left behind was the only way he could get what he wanted, only way he could get complete freedom, and live his life the way he wanted.The annoying, wearisome behavior of his parents was one of the major reasons that caused him to take this decision. He was worn out, tired of this whole civilization thing, the society. So he decided to leave everything behind, his possessions, money, and even his identity. He donated all his money he had for his future education to charity.
On his way of leaving the society behind, on his way into the wild, he meets new people, and he learns new things from them. And he gets to spend the life he wanted away from the materialistic society.The story is about his journey. It's an awesome story. Very enjoyable. And so were the performances. Brilliant. All of the actors were very suited for their roles. The directing was also very good.
And this movie also teaches a very important lesson, to learn that you need to watch the movie.
This movie is not just another movie about survival it's more than that. It teaches you the greatest lessons about life.
It is one of the very few movies that can have a a very big impact on you, that it leaves you a lot of things to think about, to argue about, after watching the movie.
I think It's a must watch for anyone.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Biography"
A leap out of the rat race,"When a film poster states written and directed by Sean Penn, you can be forgiven for breaking out in a cold sweat. After all I saw his directorial debut that was The Indian Runner. Penn until this film has failed to prove to me that he was a worthy auteur.Into the Wild is about Chris McCandless (Emile Hirsch) a notable student and athlete who after graduation wants to leave his family and society at large and live in the wilderness of Alaska.The film is episodic as we see him finding a magic bus in Alaska living in the wild as the movie flashes back and forth between his adventures in Alaska, his long journey to get there as well as the effect of his planned disappearance has on his family.On his road and rail trip he met a hippie couple, some Scandinavians, worked in farm where he learned survival tips, worked in a fast food outlet and met a lonely, old man who lost his family some decades earlier and wants to adopt him.The film has narration from Chris and his sister some of which are based on his journal entries. There is an important story strand as Chris discovered that his father had been married before and had a child from that relationship and his father had abandoned that family. He felt that his family life was based on lies as well as his parents having an unhappy marriage.This might had been an impetus as to why he abandoned his present lifestyle and went on a journey of self discovery. It is based on a true story although one that has a sad ending.Emile Hirsch does well in channelling the spirit of Chris, his journey, the sense of adventure and yearning for loneliness and yet his character is so likable, mixes well with others, literate, intelligent, thoughtful and compassionate.The film is a tad over-long and tries to be fair on his parents and his sister who felt abandoned. Maybe we needed to learn more about the side characters as they all were helping him, caring and looking out for him. There is only the one sore incident when he is caught jumping on freight trains.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Biography"

"Sweet, thoughtful, and deeply moving","Chris McCandless, a young man of twenty four took his last breath in this world in August 1992 - alone. Found starved to death in an abandoned bus in Denali Park, near Fairbanks, Alaska, he had left his affluent home in the Southern U.S. after graduating from Emery College, tuned in to the call of the wild, turned on to the spirit of Jack Kerouac and Henry Thoreau, and dropped out of a society he rejected for its commercialism and greed. Directed by Sean Penn and based on Jon Krakauer's book about Chris' life, Into the Wild is a celebration of youth with its idealism, desire for adventure, and also its arrogance and short-sightedness. Penn, who seems deeply connected to his subject, consulted with Chris' parents after waiting ten years for their approval to undertake this project. The reuslt is a sweet, thoughtful, and deeply moving film but, like its main protagonist, full of contradictions.The debate over whether Chris was a highly evolved truth seeker or a vengeful and self destructive personality is not answered either in the book or the film. Ever looking for the real McCandless, Penn fills in the gaps with a semi-idealized version but since the only knowledge we have of the real person is from Chris' journals, letters, novels and poems, and the thoughts of his sister Carine (Jena Malone) narrated in voice-over, who he was remains maddeningly elusive. In spite of Chris' ultimate discovery about the true nature of happiness, Into the Wild is not a message film but a voyage of discovery in which a headstrong young man gradually acquires the wisdom to reach out to others, even to his parents in a fevered dream. More than a story about a return to nature, or a white middle class youth's protest against his parent's values, it is a search for authenticity in a world that has forgotten what truth looks and feels like.Chris is engagingly played by Emile Hirsch who had to ride the rapids of the Colorado River and lose 45 pounds in the process of making the film. He brings a quality of instant likability to his role, though at times he skirts around the edges of the character without fully inhabiting him. The film is divided into four chapters that signal Chris's growing maturity. It begins in Alaska, then flashes back to the two-year journey that brought him to this point. Along the way, he gives away his $24,000 inheritance to charity, burns all of his money, abandons his car, changes his name, and hitchhikes across the country and up to Alaska, never once communicating with his distraught family.It was part of Chris' contradiction that he rejected human relationships, yet was able to give of himself to those he met along the way. He makes a friend of Wayne (Vince Vaughn) his boss as a farm worker in South Dakota, an 81-year old retired veteran (Hal Holbrook) who offers to adopt him, a 16 year-old singer-songwriter (Kristen Stewart), and a pair of aging free spirits Rainey and Jana (Catherine Keener and Brian Dierker). These contacts appear to be genuine but McCandless keeps his distance. When Jana tells Chris about her own son who ran away and hasn't been heard from in two years, he seems curiously unmoved and is silent when Jana tells him how children are often cruel to their parents.Backed by original songs by Eddie Vedder that never seem discordant, Into the Wild is a beautiful film that should be remembered at Oscar time, if only for Hal Holbrook's masterful supporting performance. Though it occasionally lapses into clichés such as Chris telling Tracy that ""If you want something in life, reach out and grab it"" and melodramatic scenes where the sun emerges from the clouds just at the right moment, the film has a grasp of the grit of life and ultimately becomes transcendent. While we may rightly view Chris' short life as a tragedy, but as Albert Einstein says, ""the real tragedy of life is what dies inside a man while he lives"".Whatever else could be said about Chris, and as a parent I am appalled by his cruelty in refusing to contact his mother and father or even his sister for a period of two years, to him life was a game that was only worth playing 100%. Those who refuse to take risks in life may stand in judgment of McCandless and call him stupid, yet some have forgotten what it is like to be young and some never knew. He made mistakes, serious errors of judgment, yet in the end I am reminded of what George Bernard Shaw says, ""I rejoice in life for its own sake. Life is no ""brief candle"" for me. It is a sort of splendid torch which I have got hold of for the moment, and I want to make it burn as brightly as possible before handing it on to future generations."" Chris McCandless life was a candle that burned brightly on both ends, then flickered and died but what he has passed on to us is a splendid torch.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Biography"

Mediocrity,"I found this film terribly underwhelming. Part of that may well have to do with my expectations set by the gushing praise I've heard before, and the one review I read here before watching -- in which a girl said it was so moving she cried.I didn't think there was anything moving about this film. An interesting narrative, to be sure, and containing some very compelling scenes, but it hardly seemed like anything original, and some of the scenes were totally hackneyed. Man ascends mountain and reaches up to the firmament, camera pans around at majestic landscape, & so on.There just seemed to be far too many clichés in this film for it be called moving. The sister's voice over narration, full of tired praise for her brother's intelligence, adventurous & rebellious spirit, &c, became tedious. His parents were caricatures of the suburban American nuclear family. The 'nature good, cities bad' message was more than a little heavy-handed, particularly in the Los Angeles scenes.I found it annoying that in several instances the lead actor looked directly into the camera (for instance, when he is eating an apple early in his travels). For me it shattered the attempt at realism and the sense of isolation and freedom the character was meant to have.Overall, while not without a fluid plot, solid acting and shots of stunning landscapes, the message of the film itself wasn't anything new, nor was it particularly well put. It was ho-hum at best.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Biography"
Freedom,"If you want to taste freedom and introspect life, meaning and society you need to watch this movie. Emile Hirsch has embodied life of Chris McCandless so profoundly it is beautiful to watch. This movie moves you to tears as you watch Chris leaving all behind to find true life meaning until his very end. It's a mix of sadness and happiness that leaves your wanting to know more and understand more. This movie will always be the movie that will stuck with you for a long time making you never forget it specially in times when you feel stuck or smothered. If you haven't watched it, please go ahead and watch you will not regret it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Biography"
Great Achievement,"I had read the book before seeing the movie and they are very different experiences. In the book you project so much into McCandless world, whereas in the film you are handed down more about what Penn understood from the book. This makes it more difficult to absorb because in some moments you gain a sense of empathy and identity and then it moves into another direction. It is difficult to understand if McCandless is a loner, adventurer or just internally angry. With this you lose a lot of what takes a film from being good to being great.Essentially it is one man's odyssey and personal journey. The narrative of the film drives a certain set of understanding about the character that could have been better addressed if the cast was more stripped down. Too many philosophical points are trying to be made when the only real point is why people choose to take the paths they do. At a level this films tells us what that is but on another level it doesn't add up. There is more to it that we don't get to see or fully understand I think the subject would have been better handled with a different director but Penn made it his baby. By doing that he allowed his own ego to tarnish a film that should have been about the complete absence of ego. Penn clearly would have loved the lead role if he had been 25 years younger so projects it onto Hirsch, who in some cuts looks scarily like a younger Penn - so as an actor Hirsch tries to live up to something he is not. Like a dad cheering a son at football whilst all the time berating him for not doing it how he would.The supporting class don't have any depth to them because Penn ( and this is a good thing) over estimates the intelligence of his audience to fill in the gaps.It is certainly an accomplished film with a difficult subject and kudos for the attempt but I don't believe Penn is of the caliber of Director to pull this kind of subject off - yet.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Biography"
"Penn takes tedium, predictability, cheese, and rhetoric to new heights","Having read many excellent negative reviews of this movie, I figured I should try to come up with a positive one. While I hated the movie myself, I can honestly highly recommend ""Into the Wild"" to certain people under certain conditions.""Into the Wild"" would make an excellent teaching tool for film professors to show their students what not to do when making a film. It turns out to be a pretty comprehensive survey. The egregious overuse of alternative camera techniques is a good cautionary tale. Folks who want to see some nostalgic camera angles that haven't been used since the original ""Batman"" series might be particularly pleased. Also, since there is at least 60 minutes of unnecessary footage left in the film by the editors, you could use this as an opportunity to have students edit the movie themselves.There are endless opportunities for party games you could invent around this movie. Have your party guests take a drink every time there's a cheesy camera shot or redundant voice-over or caption. You can also play ""mute the film and guess the dialogue."" Whoever comes closest to the actual dialogue wins, and whoever can't predict what is being said at all gets thrown out of the party.Other reviewers have already mentioned the movie's potential as a sleep aid. I don't know if I would go that far, but I think ""Into the Wild"" would make a great background to working out. There is something about watching a movie make the same point over and over for over 2 hours, to bad music, that reminds me of the rigors of exercise.

Thought-provoking Movie,"I watched this movie as an assignment of my university. At first, I thought it was a stereotypical movie about a young boy who travelled around the USA to escape his reality but learned a lot during his trip and then went back to his home. However, it was not such a story and deeper than I expected. It provoked me into thinking about materialism.Christopher McCandless takes a journey to survive in the wilderness by himself. Along the way, he encounters many kinds of people who shape his life. In Alaska, his final destination, he learns a lesson about happiness and comes to a tragic end.As I said, the movie lets me think about Materialism. In our society, we can't live without things like money and everyday convenience like smart phones. I think we feel emotionally satisfied if we have them. McCandless throws away all his belongings including family, smartphones and money. However, he realizes he can't live alone and discovers the importance of things during his odyssey. Moreover, his tragic end emphasises his opinion about happiness. He learns and tells us that we have to endure our society even if we have complaints about that society and we should take care of our family without selfishness. I highly recommend the movie as a good opportunity to rethink our behaviours and thoughts.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Biography"

A rubber road movie of self discovery,"As with Terrence Malick's 2005 film 'The New World' parts of Into the Wild come across like a poem on the screen, snowy landscapes, wild animals, flowing streams and breathtaking skies. I'm also a sucker for a voice-over and slow motion if used properly and here director Sean Penn does both to great effect which just adds to the poetic nature of the overall piece. Emile Hirsch should get an Oscar nomination for his role as Christopher McCandless the college graduate who gives away everything he has, college funds to Oxfam, cuts up his I.D. cards, burns his leftover dollars and embarks on the journey that will take him across America and eventually land him in Alaska. After graduating Christopher decides he want to leave society, find the true human spirit, and leave behind his privileged but stifling lifestyle and especially his overbearing and bickering parents. So without telling anyone he sets off destined to find himself. Told in chapters the film follows Christopher from the start where he re-names himself Alexander Supertramp to the final days in Alaska where he lives in the magic bus. Along the way he meets various characters that in some way help to shape him as he travels and as he grows from boy to man. As well as the stunning cinematography, great acting and fascinating story there is the soundtrack which is at times incredibly powerful, with original material from Pearl Jam's Eddie Vedder it hard to imagine some of the scenes without it as it is so integral to the plot. Cursed by intelligence and maybe slight madness Alex is documenting his time and when he's not writing he's reading Tolstoy and Kafka amongst others and it's not just his mind he needs to expand as he learns the skills he needs to fend for himself, collecting berries and hunting animals he soon discovers it's not as easy as it seems. But a firm sense of determination pushes him forward and sees him adapt to almost anything. The structure of the film is fragmented and jumps to different time periods which is what keeps you guessing right up until the parting shot which to me was unexpected and left me a little stunned. At two and half hours it is quite a long film but it never feels it and the best way to enjoy it is to let yourself go and immerse yourself fully in the experience. Into the Wild should stay with you long after you've seen it, who hasn't dreamt at some point of disappearing and living free from the shackles of modern life? It is both a memorable and moving film that should become an American classic.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Biography"
Even better than the book?,"When film adaptations stray from their source material, even slightly, it usually irks me. That was not the case with Into the Wild, however. The film takes certain liberties with the facts and characters reported on by Jon Krakauer in the book of the same name, but the result seems to align so perfectly with the spirit of the book, and Emile Hirsch embodies Chris McCandless so vividly, that I find myself asking whether the film may even be better than the piece of nonfiction that inspired it. As deeply reported as Krakauer's book is, the film brings McCandless and his journey to life in a way that the printed word could not.The acting, and not just by Hirsch, is excellent. People who encountered McCandless during his travels and were later interviewed by Krakauer are fleshed out with verve by the ensemble cast. We know from the book that McCandless and Wayne Westerberg (Vince Vaughn), who hires him to be a part of a combine harvester crew, got along well, but their complicity comes alive in a bar scene that is both funny and utterly believable.The film also looks gorgeous, as might be expected of a depiction of life on the road in the American West, and the soundtrack fits perfectly, mixing songs by Eddie Vedder that sound as if they could have been written by McCandless himself and classic Americana that never feels forced or kitschy.I must admit that I found it impossible to maintain critical distance from Into the Wild while watching it. I suspect that how one experiences this movie will depend on the degree to which one sympathizes with McCandless and his rejection of modern society (more than thirty years ago!). If you do not, then you may find yourself in the sizable camp of those who find McCandless to have been irrational, selfish, and immature, and Krakauer and director Sean Penn to be irresponsible for glorifying his misguided quest. If, however, you identify with McCandless and the way he felt, then he becomes a sort of patron saint of self-determination, a heroic example of someone who had the courage to go beyond the usual complaining and attempt to live out their ideals, in spite of the risks of doing so. I confess that I belong to the second group, and that the film moved me, remaining in my thoughts for days after I watched it and giving the vague feeling that a better life might be possible, if only one had the courage to seek it.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Biography"

Socialist Idealism leads to death,"The six is for the cinematography, the moral of the story gets a one.I am an Objectivist (philosophy of Ayn Rand). Let me make a few notes here: If the parents were such horrible selfish bastards, they could have just gone on with their lives.The character, McCandless, has that ""forced smile"" that I see on everyone that is pretending to be happy in spite of the facts. I see the same look on the faces of Jesus worshippers, that they are DETERMINED to show themselves as happy. I am not talking about optimism, I mean a person that lives on a diet of spiritual poison (idealistic altruism) and smiles to convince themselves its OK.Objectivists scorn the idea of sacrifice. The term must be properly defined. A sacrifice is choosing something of lesser value over something of greater value. With this clear definition, sacrifice is an immoral act. When he gives the old man his quarter rather than call his sister, that is clearly a sacrifice, and clearly immoral.Nature may on occasion be beautiful, but it is ruthless. When McCandless is gazing into the sky, he is not seeing the face of god, he is seeing the dispassionate sun and clouds, which will watch him live or die with equanimity. The lesson? Don't count on the sky, except to recognize it is only your mind which is beautiful, with its ability to reason. Your mind is more beautiful and complex than water vapor, or even the sun.Sean Penn is certainly the guy to create this evil little movie. Surrounded by material things himself, he idealizes the anti-material lifestyle (though not enough to give up his own investment portfolio). He asks ""why can't we just love one another?"" and then forces Obama on us, so that we can made to sacrifice to the irresponsible at the point of a gun.For more information, please read 2 short books - The Virtue of Selfishness, and Capitalism, the Unknown Ideal, both by Ayn Rand.Altruism rots the soul.

I finally saw the film again, and enjoyed it even more the 2nd viewing and FIRMLY place it in my top 5 films in history (yeah I'm typically a mainstream guy ... Star Wars, Indiana Jones, and Lord of the Rings are also in the top 5, but this one even shines above those in many ways).The acting, directing, and adaptation of a true story are wonderful. The real settings (not some studio back-lot) are apparent. You are really brought along for the journey. There is something primal in all of us, and this movie points that out better than any other movie out there. While I can't say I will ever have a journey like the one in the movie, I can say that it is something of a fantasy to shed the shackles of ""normal"" lives and just go out into the world and really live. Chris McCandless really lived, and to some degree he will always be a hero and inspiration to me thanks to Sean Penn's amazing film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Biography"
"Not Clear on the Hype, But Not a Bad Film","After graduating from Emory University, top student and athlete Christopher McCandless (Emile Hirsch) abandons his possessions, gives his entire $24,000 savings account to charity and hitchhikes to Alaska to live in the wilderness. Along the way, Christopher encounters a series of characters that shape his life.The casting deserves mention. Jena Malone as the sister (and narrator) was the wisest decision made on this film. Malone really needs to be in more films, and this was a shining moment for her. Kristen Stewart, on the other hand, needs to be in fewer films, and it defies logic that she somehow beat others at audition.Vince Vaughn, Zach Galifianakis and a handful of others bring some star power to this (with all due respect to Emile Hirsch, he is not a household name). Their roles are small but effective. Great job. The Eddie Vedder soundtrack -- do we need two hours of Vedder? No. But we get it just the same.Although the film gets better as it goes (deeper ""in to the wild""), its popularity and high praise are something of a mystery. If anything, it seems to have grown in stature since its first release. Why? While interesting, it never really gets to the meat of its subject. Why rejecting society and civilization was the right decision. Assuming, of course, it was... which is debatable.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Biography"
The beauty of living in ancient human conditions,"Into the Wild is a true story of Christopher Johnson McCandless aka Alexander Supertramp aka Chris, who, after his graduation, went on to live into the icy jungle of Alaska (inspired by Thoreau's Walden), leaving everything behind, including his family and all his money.Director Sean Penn doesn't just show Chris' life in Alaska but his college life and the core reason of why he had this way figured out in chapter wise storytelling which adds interest and structure to the movie. Being a nature oriented cinematography, the visuals of trees, mountains, rivers, free birds are obvious but these images make powerful impact in the movie, especially when Chris looks at the mountains.Casting is good. Emily Hirsch is perfect for the role, young, full of attitude and firm on his opinion. William Hurt, Marcia Gay Harden and Jena Malone played a good role as Chris' family. Kristen Stewart was beauty and sparkling as a young girl and even for a short duration, she added happiness in the movie. But, what took the movie to a greater level is the performance of Hal Holbrook as Ron. He just nailed it. A retired military old man, rich in experience and philosophy who connects easily with Chris and becomes a family bond.Movie is in good pace and tells us clearly how Chris' parents fought over the years, forcing Chris to live secluded. His love for books by Leo Tolstoy and Thoreau shaped his radical ideas and love for the nature and rebellious thinking.Scenes of Chris diving into the river, adventurously sailing with his kayak into the flood river, walking into the Alaskan beauty mountains, running behind horses in open field and hitting the road symbolizing the ultimate freedom are shown beautifully, making you want to live like this.What makes Into the Wild a magical experience is the Eddie Vedder's music. Songs are just class. Perfectly in harmony with the scenario of natural living and happiness, these songs take you close to Chris' living. 'Such is the way of the world', 'No ceiling' are real pleasant to hear and 'Society' is as painful as the reality of life. The movie is easily a memorable experience and in my favorite list of movies. The quotes of Chris about career, life, nature are deep and it questions are lifestyle. If you are wise, you will understand somewhere we are wrong and lost as a civilization. Hats off to Chris!",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Biography"

A journey of a free soul,"Before writing this comment, I was worried about my ideas, my subjectivity and also my admiration for Sean Penn. The fact that Sean Penn has made a great choice in everything in this movie surprised me a lot. The music, the casting, the places, I give 10/10. This movie reminded me of my journeys- and I really wanted to set off the road. It's like, we think, we dream while we are travelling, we plan things, we imagine to find something else new and somehow, we feel free. In this movie, you say, yes there it is. This is what it feels like! You discover, you experience and there's nothing compared to that amazing feeling. Sean Penn reflects this imaginary view through his camera. There are some parts in the film which i can describe as a painting or a camera shot. Those brilliant moments are combined with Emile Hirsch's great performance who appears to belong into the wild. This IS acting, this is REAL. It feels like the film has the effect of a documentary, and in some other parts, you can call it a journey film like Easy Rider and My Own Private Idaho. The number of the characters which Emile Hirch's character comes across on the road is high, but he shines in every scene. The plot mainly depends on him and he does his best. I actually couldn't believe Emile Hirsch's performance, there was no flaws at all. He became literally that person. I almost forgot the end even though I knew what was coming for him. There was just one thing maybe, because of the screenplay and also the plot, he barely spoke. His inner voice was his sister's. Thus, we can understand his ""philosophy"" or his reasons by his sister and figure out his journey which means that his every single move contributes a lot more than we think. Maybe we can define him as a 20Th Century libertine or a 2000's easy rider. Finally, I think Sean Penn did one of the most important things of his life by shooting this movie and he stays true to the character's real story, honoring his life and his purpose.

Best ever till now,"Stunning scenery, brilliant directing from Sean Penn, soulful songs from Eddie Vedder, and a remarkable, true story. Christopher McCandless (Emile Hirsch) is a college graduate from an affluent upbringing who decides to abandon his possessions and money and to live life out on the road, ala Jack London or Jack Kerouac during parts of their lives. He's a fascinating character because of his idealism and his nonconformity; he's intelligent and kind, and yet he doesn't value human relationships, preferring solitude and a deep connection to nature. Hirsch plays the part very well, displaying an easy, personable warmth but at the same time a determination to go his own way, damn the consequences. He also really looks the part, including scenes where he had to lose quite a bit of weight. His character is troubled from an upbringing that was riddled with strife, and in one moments says so simply (and sadly) ""Some people feel like they don't deserve love. They walk away quietly into empty spaces, trying to close the gaps of the past,"" and yet we get the feeling that is just one aspect of a complicated and yet simple guy.I loved the literary references in the film, starting with the title card quoting Byron, which seems so perfect: ""There is a pleasure in the pathless woods; / There is a rapture on the lonely shore; / There is society, where none intrudes, / By the deep sea, and music in its roar; / I love not man the less, but Nature more...""One of the best for sure.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Biography"

His mission: make it to Alaska and live happily amidst the peace and beauty of the wilderness, but along the way he encounters a series of characters who have an indelible affect on his life. Poignant, insightful coming-of-age tale loses some impact in the latter half, but nevertheless it's a thoughtful, emotionally gripping journey with strong acting and sturdy direction from Penn, though the use of chapter headings doesn't always seem necessary.

The best movie I have ever seen,"Ean Penn's new movie Into the Wild arrives on the wave of a well-regarded novel about a college graduate who decides that the anger and violence in civilized society is too much to handle and commences a journey through nature in order to truly live life as it was meant to be. This film is a wonderful glimpse into the life of a kid, wise beyond his years, and the bonds that he creates with people along the way. A victim of excess in wealth and a shortage of love, Christopher McCandless hid inside his mind behind knowledge and philosophy, building up his intellectual strength, as well as the physical, in order to complete his trek, ultimately leading him to Alaska. Penn never falls into the trap of showing too much heartbreak on the side of McCandless's parents, because he doesn't want the audience to second-guess the decision he made. There is no debate to be had here, our protagonist has no alternative but to get out and live off the land. Only being completely self-sufficient can he grasp a meaning for his life and one day perhaps go back with that knowledge fully learned.All the supporting players are magnificent at helping show the side to McCandless that Penn needs on display to succeed. Hal Holbrook, Brian Dierker, and Catherine Keener are by far the best of these side characters with Vince Vaughn and Kirsten Stewart adding some charm too. Dierker, Keener, and Stewart play hippie, flower-child type roles and allow Hirsch to show off how modest and unselfish he is. This is the family he deserved to have from birth and he is the son they wished their lives had earned them. At their best, all four together give some of the most emotionally charged moments in the film. Holbrook, on-the-other-hand, helps give insight into the philosophy that Hirsch needs to live with in order to survive the loneliness, looking him in the face, to come in Alaska. It is truly fascinating to see how every person adds something to his overall experience and to the tools he needs.For a movie to be even better than a good book is no small feat. Yet, that's how I felt after watching this film. It really impressed me. One of the reasons is the fantastic cinematography. Man, this is a beautifully filmed and, at 142 minutes, there are a lot of great scenes to admire.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Biography"

A better film than you may think it is,"I've read the book, and with 20 + years of active military service, I have a pretty good background in ""wilderness survival"". Make no mistake here, this is a story of cleansing and rebirth for Chris/Alex. The sad part is that he almost pulled it off. This is so well written, and acted that it deserves more than it really gets. Hal Holbrook puts in what is probably his best ever roles, and only Hal could have done this so well.Before really deciding to pan this film, read the book. Take a careful look at what Chris/Alex is really doing here. As I've said this is one more about a rebirth, and not so much escape, after realizing what his father really is. As his sister says, they were out of wedlock children, and the father only made that worse, day in and day out. The ending I would have liked to see is Chris/Alex finally squaring with his guilt and returning to the character Hal Holbrook played so well. If Chris had some survival training, he might have just pulled it off. Do give this film another look see before giving it your final grade.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Biography"
A Magnificent Film !,"I have seen this movie three times. I have seen it alone twice and once with friends. My friends did not like it. I did not enjoy watching this movie with friends. There are two ways to look at this. Maybe this film can be enjoyed alone and not with others OR as is the case with most movies you have to identify with the lead character.Much has been said about how the book has been hollywoodized or how Chris was not a doomed romantic hero but a stupid cretin with a death wish. But that isn't what the movie is all about.Into the wild is about many things. It is about natures importance in our lives. It is about peace and love and human relationships. It is about solitude. But mostly it is a coming of age story.Emile Hirsch stars in this movie as Christopher Mcandless a 24 year old college graduate who ventures into the mountains of Alaska to escape from it all. His parent's treachery and the lies that surround him. Hirsch does a beautiful job of playing Chris. He completely inhabits the role and brings out a staggering performance. Since Sean Penn himself is such a great actor maybe it was easy to bring out a performance of this magnitude in another. The film is aided by a perfect supporting cast. Every single person in this movie has done a good job. Right from Vince Vaughn to Jena Malone who plays Chris' sister and she also narrates the movie.Credit must be given to Sean Penn. You can see that in the movie there is a perfect amalgamation of the filmmakers thoughts , feelings and vision with the subject matter and that gives us a truly wondrous film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Biography"
A beautifully sad tale of a wild search,"This film is inspired by a real story of a young man who abandons his material life, to soul search deep in the wild.""Into the Wild"" is so beautifully shot, from screen composition, location and even the weather. Everything looks so beautiful. I would have believed it was a National Geographic show.The most amazing of all, is the portrayal of Chris. He is charming and brainy. He could have had a bright future, but he walked away from it to live an unconventional life. The ending scenes shows Chris in such a sorrowful state, that it would break anyone's heart. Emile Hirsch's transformation for this film is probably the most dramatic after Christian Bale in ""The Machinist"". I feel so sad and sorry that, by the act of Chris' free will, he threw his life away. I can only hope that he found what he was looking for, when his eyes saw the last glimpse of the beautiful blue sky.Sean Penn has established himself as a master of profoundly touching films. ""Into the Wild"" is one of these amazing films. It will leave you immersed in thoughts, and haunts you long after you watched it.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Biography"
Happiness only real when shared,"That's what the movie hero writes in his diary in the end. This movie tells the story of a young man who after graduating in university with very high marks decides to abandon home, family and everything and go to live into the wild in Alaska like if it was his promised land. He is pushed into that not only but what they call the lies of modern civilized life and social hypocrisy but also because, thinking like that, he is particularly hurt by his parents lies about their past private lives. While the movie progresses we hear his sister's voice off stressing the most important moments and aspects of his life. In my opinion the message the movie wants to pass is that there is a mistake to show revolt against society by running away to live with Nature and alone. In his course to Alaska our hero (who walks and hitch-hikes all the time) stops sometimes here and there to get occasional works that can give him a little money to enable him to support himself on his course. In those moments he creates bonds of friendship and love with lots of people but always rejects any possibilities of staying with them in his stubborn march to Alaska where he wants to spend at least a great part of his life in contact only with Mother Nature. He leaves lots of people who have become very fond of him, very unhappy with his absence. Mother nature is not always paradisiacal and may also be very cruel sometimes and even violent. And for instance the wild food it provides can be poisonous. Adding to the movie's credit are the beautiful landscape images and the splendid background music and songs of the country type.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Biography"
"Into the Wild gives you a different look on life through Chris McCandless, Sean Penn created a masterpiece and its his passion which makes it just that","Into the Wild was a film that left a mark on myself, both cinematically and on life. I watched it back in 2015-2016 and it was like nothing I had seen before, the realism of it. I took an instant liking to it and still remember specific scenes inside my head. It's based upon the 1996 non-fiction book of the same name written by Jon Krakauer and tells the story of Christopher McCandless (""Alexander Supertramp""). The film was written, co-produced, and directed by Sean Penn. He gives us a spectacular experience, both in entertainment and for fans of cinema. There's so many things the film does right, cinematography is one of them and Éric Gautier made a special and beautiful looking film. Another highlight is the musical score done by Eddie Vedder, along with Michael Brook and Kaki King. Into the Wild was nominated for two Golden Globes and won the award for Best Original Song: ""Guaranteed"" by Eddie Vedder. It was also nominated for two Academy Awards: Best Editing and Best Supporting Actor for Hal Holbrook.After graduating from Emory University, top student and athlete Christopher McCandless abandons his possessions, gives his entire $24,000 savings account to charity and hitchhikes to Alaska to live in the wilderness. Along the way, Christopher encounters a series of characters that shape his life.Sean Penn begins Into the Wild with Chris McCandless' mother waking up from an nightmare and afterwards we get to see a montage with our main character traveling across the States to his destination where he's going to live and survive in the wilderness, there's two reasons why this sequence makes us immersed and it's because of the writing and text we get to see from his journals but also the visuals with for example the landmarks and signs which makes us get some bearings where he is. It's an efficient way of starting the film, both storytelling and to engage the viewer. When the montage stops and the car ride is over, Jim Gallien remains in the car and we get a wide shot of the car to the left and Chris McCandless beside it, the camera angle switches from wide to normal as McCandless steps closer to Gallien. We then get to follow our protagonist and see the nature which the wilderness has to offer whilst Gallien drives back to civilization. That's the beginning of the film and already, Sean Penn knows exactly what he's doing, with a brilliant and intelligent screenplay, and terrific direction and visual storytelling from him. Through flashbacks we get to see more of who Chris McCandless was and his reasoning to do the trip two years later, which shows him burning money and leaving his car behind after a flood in Arizona and thus began hiking. Here, he shows signs of his belief in transcendentalism. As you quickly come to notice, it's not Chris McCandless who's narrating the film but in another way he does through his journal, I'm of course thinking of Carine McCandless who's narrating it. Jena Malone's performance is quite good, giving heart to the role through the narration and dramatic performance. It's quite possible this is how much of the information was gathered, through Chris McCandless' sister and parents. Another scene which has some great direction and filmmaking is when McCandless is inside a city during the end of chapter 2, you see his frustration and nervous behavior through the editing and performance, how he just wants to get out of there. That sequence shows the theme of man vs society in its entirety, how everything he had done up to that point was just right for him, which he later on fully embraced in Alaska.The film stars Emile Hirsch as McCandless, Marcia Gay Harden as his mother, William Hurt as his father, Jena Malone, Catherine Keener, Brian H. Dierker, Vince Vaughn, Kristen Stewart, and Hal Holbrook. Although Hal Holbrook doesn't have a big role in the film, his Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor is well deserved and his scenes with Emile Hirsch are excellent, truly terrific. His character is possibly entirely fictional but so well written and realistic, a performance and character you can appreciate. During my first viewing I absolutely loved Emile Hirsch's performance as Chris McCandless, it haven't changed I just have come to respect it even more, most of the time he's acting beside himself and he's great in both those scenes and the ones he's acting alongside others. He captures the soul of Chris McCandless perfectly.What film can you compare Into the Wild with? I would say Wild (2014) which stars Reese Witherspoon, it's quite a similar movie/story but the big difference is how Cheryl Strayed survived and Chris McCandless met an unfortunate demise. At first viewing, I didn't expect the film to delve so much into McCandless' background which is very similar to Wild (2014). Now on my second viewing, I'm much more grateful for the flashback chapters. If they would have solely shown us what's happening in Alaska, the film wouldn't be as 'true' because of how little is known about Chris' time there and from his other travels, yet it's what we know of him. Lots of things are probably fictional but that's alright, it's part of the experience, the events might be fictional but Chris McCandless isn't. Everything he does in the film, I'm certain he would do in real life. The ""Magic"" bus became an iconic location, a landmark because of the book and film, having been removed from its location and moved to a museum. One thing I absolutely love about the film is how it's shot on location, for example the Alaska scenes was filmed 50 miles (80 km) south of where McCandless actually died, in the tiny town of Cantwell. It just makes such a difference for us viewers and the actors when the film is shot on location like that. Into the Wild is a cinematic masterpiece, a film I've wanted to rewatch for many years and it was finally the right time. The film remains entertaining and interesting, making you rethink life. The ending remains heartbreaking. Sean Penn created a masterpiece with Into the Wild, its cinema. I'll leave my final words for. Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times, who gave the film four stars out of four and described it as ""spellbinding"". Ebert wrote that Emile Hirsch gives a ""hypnotic performance"", commenting: ""It is great acting, and more than acting."" Ebert added, ""The movie is so good partly because it means so much, I think, to its writer-director, Sean Penn.""",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Biography"

"overlong and precious, also marvelous cinematography and solid turn by Emile Hirsch","Christopher McCandless, in a manner of existential terms, had it all really. He graduated from college, had $24 grand in tuition, and a possible future law career. He could do anything he wanted with his life. So, he followed his passions, mixed perhaps with some escapist connotation involving a wounded family history, and left on a solo trek across the 'wild' of America, eventually on a quest to Alaska. At that point, he used what little knowledge he had to live off the land, hunt for game, and be one with nature while camping out of an abandoned 'Magic Bus' vehicle. It's here that we see the story, told in a somewhat typical non-linear form, take shape around the intellectual scope of a quintessential Thoreau wannabe.In Into the Wild, Sean Penn's treatment of this man- who, eventually, died of poison-cum-starvation- this is a quest that is made interesting by the people that Christopher (sorry, Alexander Supertramp) meets along the way, which include some hippies in a van (an earthy Catherine Keener one of them), a very young Joan Mitchell type (Kristin Stewart), and blue collar worker (Vince Vaughn), and the proverbial 'wise old man' (Hal Holbrook, easily my favorite of the lot). They help bring a human dimension to what would otherwise be a guy, somewhat but not quite disillusioned by a particular American society, walking around in a state of being that calls one back to the discussion between Jules and Vincent over 'walking the Earth' in Pulp Fiction.Is he just a 'bum', or is a true risk-taker? Or is it just all, as Christopher at one point admits, for a possible future book to come out of this? These questions arise, and some others, as Penn tries to question himself what kind of audience is coming to see his film. Will they easily pass judgment on a kid in over his head and not prepared for full-blown saga out of Jack London, or as someone who sadly lost the good fight against all reasonable responsibilities as a common, law-abiding citizen? Luckily, Penn did cast just right for us to want to be with this character, as Emile Hirsch has the qualities of strength and vulnerability so that he doesn't make him unsympathetic (which, for this sort of character, could be easy to do), but keeps him grounded and strong and, simply, just right for the part in this context.The only problems come with Penn, as a director, taking flights of pretentious fancy with his style. Part of the problem with taking on a tale of going out to nature is there's the tendency for the visuals to outweigh some of the narrative strengths. It's reminiscent more of his work on the Crossing Guard (though not as much), and there are some passages and montages and those chapter breaks and yellow words streaming across the screen that do mark it as original but not necessarily driving much with the story. If it's poetry he was looking for, it's not achieved with the utmost beauty or grace, despite the marvelous moments that he and his director of photography grasp the many landscapes. And, as the greatest asset, Eddie Vedder on the soundtrack- who's songs might even be better than the movie itself- compliment the nature of the character but also sounding fine as stand-alone songs or guitar numbers.So, take a trip into this moral conflict that strikes up Into the Wild as a worthwhile effort, if not a masterful one, and see what it's like to be young and escaping and living life to the fullest, if not the smartest.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Biography"

This story captures the beauty and unforgiving spirit of the great Alaskan wilds. But by the end of the movie I can forgive McCandless' lack of preparedness because he was truly willing to give up everything, even his life, to pursue his true human nature and leave all the comforts of the modern world behind.

To achieve happiness, you have to sacrifice some of your own freedom and goals.

Above-Average Road Movie,"An intelligent, but socially dysfunctional, white boy, who comes from a privileged family, does not plan his road trip very well and becomes a victim of nature. Nature should never be underestimated or minimized in any way in road trips of this kind. The hippie message of the film is quite clear, and brought back fond memories of my youth. It also brought back recollections of mistakes that were made during that era as well by us who dropped out and tuned in.
Being a tramp is not a great adventure. Ask any of the thousands of families who lost loved ones during the Great Depression (see Grapes of Wrath). Usually, being a tramp is a gradual decline into oblivion. Nature is not free. There is a price to be paid for everything in life. Burning money is not symbolic; it is just plain stupid. There are millions on the earth who would love to have that money so they could eat a good meal. This young man's life was tragic, but there was a lesson to be learned from it.

about a free spirited college grad with some beautiful scenery,"Personally, I think Chris was crazy to do what he did and also it was very cruel of him not to at least call or write his family so they knew where he was. Shortly after graduating college, Chris decides to give away his money and go on a road trip without telling anyone. His car gets washed out in the desert and from that point he walks everywhere. He lives off the land and gets a little help from others by hitchhiking. He travels everywhere and gets a job driving a tractor to make a little money for his quest to Alaska. He also meets two hippies a couple of times who help him. He breaks this old guy's heart by leaving since he was his only friend. Chris also takes a journey in a kayak all the way to Mexico. He finally ends up in Alaska and stays the winter in the wilderness. When he tries to leave, the river has flooded and he is stuck. Chris meets his demise in the wild due to eating poisonous plants.He wrote down most of his journeys so that is how his family was able to piece together what he did after leaving them. I thought it was sad for his family since he never called them. He may have been angry with his parents but considering what he did, I don't think he's a sympathetic character.There was nothing great about the acting. Only the outdoor scenery was about average.

The Little Punce,"Sean Penn's film about Christopher McCandless who shed his college and suburban life for a fatal nomadic journey is a really disturbing and absorbing film. It is extraordinarily well made and acted by Emile Hirsch. However what struck and disturbed me more than anything was how cruel and self absorbed and selfish our hero behaved. He caused pain beyond belief to his well meaning parents and sister, he burned his money instead of giving it to a poor family who needed it, he squatted in self absorbed diary bliss, he rejected all advances of friendship that did not benefit his mood at the time, ... in fact a good moment to demonstrate how unconscious he was of anyone else's feelings is late in the film when he cajoles an old man to climb up and across a really rocky and difficult mountain blissfully unaware that the hike is physically beyond the old man. He simply has no clue to another person's feelings. So our hero does really silly and dangerous things in his Kerouac style adventure down rapids and on freight trains and hitching lifts and staying as he chooses... and causing heartbreaking grief for his family. I was appalled to find this was a true story and it is to Penn's skill as a film maker that the astonishing selfishness of McCandless' self absorbed pilgrimage is spelled out as clearly as it is. Our hero might have had some teen issues with his family, but the rejection and ignorance of their feelings is utterly vile. Only a rich white teenager could behave in such a rotten way believing in this self righteous bubble that his selfish quest is some misguided noble back-to-basics adventure. In a film of many great scenes the standout was his tortured despairing father collapsing on the road in the suburb where they still lived. The hurt this boy caused! the terrible agony of not knowing where he was, and this brat thought all that was OK because HE was on a selfish quest. Penn's film is a great one and an expose of the sort of ruthless inconsiderate cruelty one generation worries about for the younger.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Biography"
A Selfish Quest for Truth,"Sean Penn's film ""Into the Wild"" was based on true events and will haunt viewers long after the final credits fade to black. A recent college graduate, disillusioned by his parents' materialism and duplicity, Christopher McCandless heads off on a meandering journey with the goal of eventually reaching Alaska. Once he has ""disappeared"" by abandoning his car, burning his money, and erasing his identity, the young man wanders the American west in search of himself. The ensuing road movie details the various encounters that he has over the months and years of his journey of discovery. Although Christopher has lost faith in human relationships, he meets and seemingly bonds with a number of people, all of whom take to the engaging, often charming, young man and try to help him. However, he unsentimentally severs his bonds with each, although they apparently have developed feelings and care for him. Rejecting friendship, Christopher seemingly has no romantic feelings or sexual desires either, and he rejects the one overture that is explicitly made.McCandless's wanderings eventually take him to the Alaskan wilderness where he takes shelter in an abandoned bus and manages to survive on fish and game. The film flashes back and forth between his time in the bus and earlier episodes. The words of his diary are quoted throughout the film, and his eventual realization that there is little joy in life without sharing it with someone comes too late. Emile Hirsch fills the physically demanding role of Christopher and plays it exceptionally well. Among the people Christopher encounters, Catherine Keener and Hal Holbrook stand out as a mature earth mother and a lonely widower, respectively.""Into the Wild"" was made with the cooperation of the McCandless family, who were brave to have exposed themselves and their feelings so publicly. Well played by William Hurt and Marcia Gay Harden, the parents emerge as typical appearance-obsessed Americans who cannot understand their son and mourn and grieve at his alienation and absence. They are not villains, and the son's actions wreak more pain on his family than they ever deserved or inflicted on him. In fact, the young man leaves much pain behind him in his ultimately selfish journey. Not only do his parents and sister suffer, but a young girl, an old retired widower, and a generous middle-aged hippie couple all fall victim to his charms and eventual abandonment. Although Christopher seems convinced that he is on a noble quest, there is nothing noble about inflicting unwarranted pain on those who love you. The words of his final realization and the images that end the film will be etched indelibly in viewers' minds. With both the screenplay and direction to his credit, Sean Penn has fashioned an outstanding adaptation of Jon Krakauer's book and has moved beyond ""promising"" to ""accomplished"" status in both roles.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Biography"
Into the white desert,"Sean Penn is becoming one of America's most interesting directors.

They give him, voluntarily and not, examples of what life really is about. Nobody makes it on this earth without a society, which can mean so many more things when just the state. If you avoid it, you'll get punished by freedom itself.This is something as unusual as an ideological movie, with a certain morality put there on serious purpose.

"""Happiness is only real when shared.""","""Into the Wild"" is the inspirational albeit heartbreaking story of a brilliant young man named Christopher McCandless who abandoned the premise of a wealthy existence to follow the footsteps of his hero Jack London and answer the call of the wild. He eventually died of starvation after two years of a journey that ended in Alaska where he spent 110 days in a bus lost in the middle of an ancient mining town named Stampede Trail. The bus is still there with Chris' remaining belongings, his diary and his aura.It's a sad story but not a tragedy. Chris chose his destiny and gave it its full meaning. He didn't know what he was seeking but knew what he was rejecting, believing the journey mattered more than the destination. Such a story called for a movie and of all directors, it was Sean Penn who adapted the book of writer and mountaineer Jon Krakauer, rightfully believing the material would still find a profound echo in people's hearts 15 years after Chris' death. His movie is not only served by a breathtaking cinematography and a haunting performance by Emile Hirsch, it also benefits from a clever editing, ironically the only category to be Oscar-nominated besides Hal Holbrook's supporting performance.The editing matters because one can't look at Chris' odyssey as something linear, the film opens by swinging back and forth between the ""Magic Bus"" discovery and family flashbacks, respectively the ""beginning of the end"" and ""the end of the beginning"". The non-linear storytelling creates the same startling puzzlement as the people who met Chris the adventurer when they discovered where he came from: a wealthy family with two highly educated parents (William Hurt and Marcia Gay Harden) who tried to shape his future with their ""present"" as a model. So when we see this young hiker barely accepting a pair of boots before getting in the middle of the wild nowhere, we know something failed in the McCandless' educational project.The contrast is even more striking as Hirsch suffers from the same cruel syndrome than many young men who, beardless, look ten years younger despite the fact that the stories are set only two years apart. So we can see both the plant of rebellion growing and the roots in Chris' past. And Penn chooses the right way to relate the process, Chris couldn't be the narrator, he's a man of action and his actions speak for his rejections: refusing a car as a gift, gives his entire $24,000 savings to charity, burning money, cutting his credit card, everything that superficially defined him.So it's through his sister's monologue that we understand what sowed the seeds of his non-conformist: his father's infidelity, domestic violence and the way his parents' materialistic achievements alienated them from their two children and painted a forever disgraceful portrait of success in the mind of Chris (the sister is played by Jena Malone). So Chris expressed his disagreement many times until it was time to walk the walk. So we can clearly see the initial motives and the end of the journey.And the middle-story is indirectly told by someone who only left behind him a series of encounters with strangers that Krakauer could track in order to reassemble the pieces of the puzzle. Chris didn't write anything until he came to the bus because it represented the edge of his adventure, the real challenge he was seeking. During the last two years where he was still looking for himself, he met a couple of hippies (Brian Dierker and Catherine Keener) a farmer (Vince Vaughn), a couple of Danish tourists and finally Hal Holbrook as Ron Franz.In every case, something immediately caught their hearts, they shaped his vision but so he did with his genuine sincerity, brave approach to life and optimism. And though Hirsch gave a great performance, bizarrely snubbed, the real Chris looked even more sympathetic.Speaking from experience, I had my share of friends in business school who were acting like pseudo rebels, rejecting the comfort of modernity, career, family and wealth, only to get back in the ranks once the diploma obtained. Young privileged ones like Chris are numerous but a few of them dare to act according to their thoughts and that's why Chris immediately cuts to our hearts, he's a man of his word. And go figure why, I was thinking of Anne Frank while finishing the film. Maybe it's because I saw the film recently but here are the points of comparisons.Both died in their youth and became universal symbols of a spirit resisting the pressure of the world and seeking honesty, purity and peace. Both had a diary they couldn't finish. Both depended on the kindness of people and it's a real shame for Franz who couldn't adopt Chris (Holbrook melted my heart in his last scene). Finally, both have universal posthumous legacies and we can only picture them with a smile on their faces. Of course, Anne didn't chose her life but she lived tragedy with her family while Chris lived happiness he couldn't share.Happiness indeed. Chris' last picture shows him with a smile on his face, looking gaunt like a Concentration Camp survivor but smiling nonetheless. He didn't want to die, he might have expected it when he realized he couldn't get back anywhere and never let enough hints to be found, but his survival journey into the wild made him a model for young people who felt an instant need to discover themselves while discovering the world.Chris could learn a few things before getting back and coming to terms with his family but he didn't have time to practice what he learned. Still, what he lived taught the world a lesson, a practical one about survival, a universal one about being true to yourself and a timeless one about dreams and happiness, achieving dreams is important but dreaming alone can be dangerous, if not lethal.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Biography"

Unbelievably Great Movie!!!,"I rarely write reviews for anything, but I will make an exception for this one. I think the most accurate feeling I had after seeing this movie was the distinct impression of reeling in space, like when you were a kid and you got enough courage to ride (what you thought at the time) to be the scariest roller coaster you've ever seen. I think it takes courage to see a movie like this. Be warned, this is not your typical Hollywood big budget formulaic movie. I will be thinking about this movie for a long time. What I liked (no, loved) about this movie was its ability to keep you interested and at the same time let its message keep humming in the background. ""Happiness is only real when it is shared..."" This movie wanted me to embrace the world in a way that EVERYONE SHOULD FEEL. People's lives are a unique poetry all to their own, live yours like you're trying to say something, but never forget that JOY can be had by reveling in the idea that WE ALL SHARE OUR LIVES (in some way) WITH EACH OTHER...",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Biography"
Reality-altering,"""Into the Wild"" is one of the few films that can alter one's perception of reality long after one has exited the theatre. The tale is not so much depressing as it is encouraging; not so much the tale of a thickheaded pariah but one of a modern day Jesus (McCandless was even asked if he was Jesus on his journey).While some who read Jon Krakauer's bestseller deemed the youth a foolish outcast who needlessly lost his life because of a reckless overdose in idealism, the film paints his journey in a different, more thought-provoking light  seemingly the core of writer/director/producer Sean Penn's focus in making the film.Penn seemed to adapt the movie not simply verbatim from the novel, but by cherry picking some of the most appropriate passages of the book to highlight larger considerations of humanity's true place in modern society. It is much less a chronological tale of a young man's journey to Alaska as it is a film that appeals to some of our deepest fears and questions.This redefining foray into life's big questions is why Into the Wild is a must-see, a film that not only tells a lot about the human psyche and our suppressed instincts, but puts it all in a context of a complete rejection of the overwhelming nature of modern society.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Biography"
Beautifully filmed and well-acted.,"A beautifully filmed and well-acted tragic story of a man's struggle into the wilderness to escape from society. Featuring Sean Penn in the directorial seat, this is the true story of Christopher McCandless who took the name Alexander Supertramp as he hitchhiked across the country to Alaska in the early nineties. The film is over two hours long and a bit lengthy to watch when stuck in the middle but rewardingly good when finished. It is like The Motorcycle Diaries in a sense only without the political stance and the motorcycle and company. Emile Hirsch is a stunning discovery in this brilliant career move. Although opinions on the main character's views vary especially considering the conclusion to his journey, the important thing about this film is that it makes you think about your own humanity and precepts and whether or not life has become more than a game of survival for you. This film takes an aura quite like most road movies but it is one of a kind and certainly one of those films you'll never forget.http://iwascalledclementine.multiply.com/reviews",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Biography"
Sensational,"Into the Wild is an alternately enthralling and wrenching portrait of a young man who ran from his problems and searched for peace and found paradise and, in turn, anguish and despair. Chris McCandless' journey is a gripping travelogue that's both a cautionary tale and a vicariously exhilarating experience; man, it looked like he had a whale of a good time, but man, did it end badly for him.First and foremost, what makes Into the Wild work so flawlessly is that even knowing the final outcome doesn't change the overall effect that movie will have on the average moviegoer. Based on McCandless' real story, the movie pulls few punches in how the protagonist is depicted; he's neither a saint nor a sinner, just an idealistic (and not naive), troubled college graduate who feels adrift from literally everything: parents, life, friends.Chris (Emile Hirsch) is a highly intelligent Emory College grad, the son of a NASA scientist (William Hurt) and an entrepreneur (Marcia Gay Harden). But unlike other privileged young citizens, Chris has no intentions of enjoying the gifts and wealth his family and connections have afforded him. Instead, he gives away his life savings of $24,000, abandons his beat-up Datsun, leaves his family behind (without telling them), and sets of on a trek around the country.Chris's travels take him literally all over the country, across the midwest (where he runs a grain harvester for Vince Vaughn), to the Rocky Mountains, to the Grand Canyon, the Hoover Dam, Las Vegas, even down to Mexico, winding up at his ultimate resting spot: deepest, darkest, remotest Alaska. The story is told in two timelines, one of the present (the time shortly before and after Chris discovers an abandoned bus in the Alaskan wilderness), and one of the past, the events leading up to Chris's Magic Bus time. And the two timelines are brilliantly juxtaposed with each other by director Sean Penn, who doesn't just show us a perfectly linear chronology of how Chris came to be in an abandoned bus; he shows us the story behind the adventurer, the believer, the angel, the tactiturn rebel, the iconoclast.So what made Chris McCandeless decide to ditch everything and live off the land like some latter-day flower child? I'll explain no further than to say that his upbringing, under the commanding, demanding eyes of his overachieving, arguing parents, played a huge role - but perhaps not the only role. In short, Chris decides he simply does not wish to be part of the rat race; he does not wish to be trapped in a meaningless job working for a meaningless company doing trite, soul-destroying things. He wants to live and learn on his own. And that's where the inspirational aspect of this kicks in. He sets out to accomplish something undefined (i.e., the abstract Find Himself) and winds up absorbing more knowledge through his experiences than most people do through their lonely lives of quiet desperation.Along the way, Chris meets myriad people, and it's genuinely touching how much of an impact he has on their lives as he passes through. In particular, Catherine Keener plays an aging hippie whose love for her soul mate (Brian Dierker) has begun to fade; the mere presence of the Christ-like Chris magically changes that, for the better. (A lesser film might have had Chris and Jan sleeping together to foment complications in everyone's relationship.) Chris tells everyone he meets that his ultimate goal is to live in the Alaskan wilderness, consequences be damned; everyone tells him not to do it.The impression we're finally left with of Christopher McCandless is that of a clever, thoughtful, engaging young man who had more demons than a nightmare of Clive Barker dopplegangers. Haunted by his own harrowing childhood, he escaped as literally and figuratively as he could, living by the seat of his pants over thousands of miles of gravel, sand, and asphalt. His motives might have been a bit selfish (he never did try to contact his family, the film tells us), but his heart seemed to be in the right place otherwise. Which made his demise all the harder to bear.Hal Holbrook, playing a crusty benefactor to Chris in the Arizona desert, earned an Oscar nomination, and it's well deserved, but even stronger accolades are due to Hirsch, who underwent tremendous physical changes just to play Chris McCandless properly. And the final scene, the waning moments of Chris's life, is so vivid and packed with emotion that you almost can't bear to watch, peeking instead through crossed fingers. Hirsch is so excellent in the role that it's a travesty of some magnitude that he wasn't more widely recognized for his grueling, gutty performance. Even more so when you realize the guy later played Speed Racer and previously had been best known for being Judd Hirsch's kid.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Biography"

"Oh, whatever...","Sean Penn did a good job bringing the film to life. However, I have so many issues with this film.The cinematography is beautiful, helped off course by the stunning landscapes. The dialogue is very poetic, and the performances were good. The extreme close-up photography, though, was a bit nauseating at times.The film can easily be seen as a celebration of life (albeit a bit extreme!), and to explore and experience the beauty of nature. Nowadays we tend to forget nature actually exists. As for Chris, he did some nonsensical things along the way. Often, he came across as extremely ungrateful, and even selfish. His argument for not needing (any) money was absurd.There were moments I felt the film was stagnating, and I wanted to push it along. 148 minutes is just way too long for a film like this to sit through, especially also since it is slow moving, and the non-linear narration. So, although it is a very well made film, - and there probably are a few lessons to be learnt here - it simply wasn't entertaining enough.Based on fact, I'm wondering whether I should actually feel sorry for real-life Chris McCandless, on who's adventures the film is based. He brought what happened to him upon himself. Pure self-indulgence! He didn't think his adventure through properly and didn't plan ahead, and certainly didn't do enough research - typical spoiled brat! Having given his ENTIRE savings to charity tells me he was never planning on returning, and that this was probably a suicide mission.After more than tow hours and an ending I somehow predicted, I was really glad when it ended.",3.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Biography"
One of the greatest movies ever about life,"Supertramp - are you Jesus?

note to the haters,"The consensus from the haters of this film was that the main character was crazy or selfish or stupid or whatever, and that the film portrayed him falsely.

Truly excellent film.,"Rarely upon viewing motion pictures based on trues stories/books, etc. do I come into the process with high anticipation. More often than not I've found myself leaving the cinema morose and let down by yet another Hollywood director who has chosen to glamorize the story for his own ego ignoring the facts and the truth that needs no help on its own. This film, however, is different. Seasoned, veteran actors, such as John Hurt and Hal Holbrook, who might not normally lend their talents to a movie released on a smaller scale such as this, remarkably excel in their roles. Marcia Gay Harden relishes her role as McCandless's mother and it shows. The numerous backdrops where Chris ""resided"" on his journey are breathtaking, and the screenplay by the great Sean Penn left me with a lump in my throat more than a few times throughout the film. You owe it to yourself to see this picture. Moreover, read the book first for the exact insight into Chris's adventure, by Jon Krakauer, and then see the movie. I dare you to leave without swallowing a few lumps.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Biography"

The anger at his parents and society in general that Chris fosters drives him to become a wanderer and he decides to go up north to Alaska to live in the wild, but on the way to the wild, I feel, is the real meat of the movie.

Wild Deer,"We have a strange little movie here. The main character seems very mean at the beginning and does things most of the viewers/the ""civilised"" world wouldn't dare to do. So is there even a chance for redemption to this character?While he doesn't really change in the course of the film (not in his overall believe), I think we find ourselves attracted to the idea of ""being free"", taking choices and not having to ask anyone if you can or can't do this and that. But what it also ultimately shows us, is that humans do need company. Even those who barricade themselves in their rooms and think they're better off alone ... aren't. There's always someone near you (not really tough, when you consider the world population), so that might drive (some of) us, into wanting to be alone, but ultimately that wish will never happen and maybe deep inside those people know it and that gives them comfort, while they think they are alone. That is what this is about (as I understood it) :o)PS: Hirsch (the main actors real last name) means deer in German, just in case you wondered!",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Biography"
oozes inspiration and emotion,"After viewing Into The Wild, I was blown away. Not only was it done well, in every sense of the phrase, but it had something to say.Emile Hirsch was surprisingly good. He was really devoted to the role and that is the essence of acting. The rest of the supporting cast was well cast and put on great performances (ecspecially that of Keener, Holbrook, and Hurt).The cinematography was masterfully done and I really praise Penn for making this film the way he did. The film really sparks a sense of thought in people that most never think about. I am almost happy that the Oscars snubbed the film because I feel its a movie that doesn't need or want praise. (just as the true life McCandless did not).I know a lot of people think that McCandless was an ignorant brat. I can understand how some might think this but perhaps him being put in that position is what caused him to do what he did. He realized that he was a spoiled rich kid and realized how unimportant being rich is. Money DOES make people too cautious and if you are too cautious you cant live to your full capacity. People should not let socio-economic status define them. I'm not saying everyone should jump ship and walk to Alaska but people should at least understand what he was trying to do and maybe take a lesson from him.One other thing that really glued the movie together was Eddie Vedder's soundtrack. Ed, as a young man, had the same views on life that McCandless did. He really poured his soul into the songs and the fact that he can relate with McCandless made him the perfect candidate. At some points during the film, the scene almost complimented the music instead of vice versa.All in all, and outstanding film and will stay with you long after you hit the eject button.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Biography"

Being a musician myself and a huge fan of Pearl Jam I loved the Eddie Vedder acoustic tracks in the movie. Great music selection in this film with other folk driven music as well.

"I feel sorry for the kid, but","He died stupid. I have lived in Alaska, and I picked up the DVD out of a nostalgia for the place. Apparently the producers did not bother about Alaskan conditions or the realities of ""living on the land"" before shooting this dog. We have an idealist who burns money and gives his college fund to Oxfam to feed others, but in his wending west seems never to turn down a free meal or a free ride, while turning down implied and implicit offers to adopt him by those who have lost children, and turning down sex from a 16-year-old (ethical, but a bit out of place in a hippie encampment). He gets good advice from all the nice people he meets (the only not-nice person in the film is the railroad guard who beats him) and apparently forgets it all on the spot.In Alaska, it really gets silly. Apparently he is somewhere in the Tanana Valley, if his plant book is anything to go by, living in a steel bus hull lacking a window or two. I know a family who wintered in Tok (in that valley) in an insulated tent with no windows: they cut and burned a cord of wood _daily_ to survive (they did have a chainsaw). He apparently stops cutting wood entirely after gathering some sticks on a beach in California. Certainly, he lucks out in the matter of light--whoever abandoned the bus apparently left gallons and gallons of oil behind--he is never in the dark. Or without matches, for that matter.He kills a cow moose, apparently with a .22, which is really wonderful shooting--moose have been known to pay about as much attention to .22 bullets as they do to yellowjackets. In good weather, he seems to spend his time mooning in the bus instead of hunting, fishing, or bringing in wood for next winter. When he gets desperate for food to the point of delirium, he eats the wrong plant and poisons himself.It was depressing to learn that this was a ""real"" story, that a genuine kid apparently was this appealing and this dumb.

This movie will change the way you view certain aspects of life (again, assuming you watch with the right attitude).If you have gripes with this guy's life and choices then you should deal with that separately from judging this movie as a film itself. As a movie, this did all the right things. It sent me on an emotional rollercoaster, it raised questions about society, its cinematography was gorgeous, and it evokes a feeling of freedom in the viewer.

The end of an  idealist,"Glorious or inglorious, that is here the question. Alex Supertramp is a down-shifter par excellence, who still needs at first the non-down-shifters for his gradual self-realization. He is an adventurer and freedom-seeker and he is not satisfied with little. He resigns materialism, the urges and lies of the American society and tries to break out into the wild nature, to experience ""real"" life. To late it dawns upon him that nature is no garden Eden and that some attainments, not so much of the civilization, rather of the socialization are reasonable. It is a surprising end that Krakauer describes with the help of the diary of the unfortunate. The movie is here not so much stringent. The end of Alex is cruel and shows that it is vain to romanticize nature. Unfortunate could be the wrong word. If Alex would not have renounced such reasonable artifacts like a map, which he intentionally left back, or at least if he had informed about the locality, he could have made it easily to survive. That he wanted it is shown clearly by his desperate struggle against death. Experienced adventurers always calculate with emergency cases when they plan their special tours. Idealism needs carbohydrates! Alex was sheepish, overambitious maybe simply silly. Yes, exaggerated idealism is sometimes nothing else than density. But it would be wrong to judge this young man. He made a decision and he paid for it. Did he find self-determination? No, no man can exist for himself, the freedom some are searching is nothing but an abstract and nature is not nice at all! She is like she is. Without man she is nothing at all. Nature is there for man, but she does not know it. But man has to know it. The sojourn in nature is a good opportunity for self-reflection. Krakauer implies that Alex could have reached the goal to live his idealism until the very bitter end. He is not different to mountaineers who notwithstanding the risks want to have their extreme experience. There is nothing left than the hope, that instead of the romantic transfiguration of a life in the wilderness or the intended union with nature  a thing that cannot exist  in the face of death the simple recognition prevailed that life, that loves and can be loved is the most sensible and praiseworthy. A lot of knowledge for a young man in our times. A recommendable film and book. Krakauer did not draw conclusions. He did not want to interpret too much into it. Perhaps because he is guilty himself of extreme adventures.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Biography"

This is how someone lived there life,"Into The Wild is a coming of age story.People from different walks of life learn different things. Material possessions and status isn't everything, and in this movie, the main character goes to the extreme to prove this. And brilliantly so. The handling of the trauma and making characters likeable could have been done better.Side note, don't let your kids feel guilty for being brought into this world. They are not burdens, expectations or bragging points. They are blessings.I enjoyed the movie.

Great but a bit depressing coming of age movie,"I heard for years about this movie for the several reasons: it's on IMDB's top 250, it's directed by Sean Penn (an actor I usually like) and it was overplayed a lot between 2015 and 2016. A month ago I finally sat through it and I had to agree with nearly everyone else.It begins in 1990. Jacob McCandless (Emile Hirsch) graduates from Emory University. He is disenchanted with modern society and decides to live in the wild. He destroys credit cards and IDs, donates his savings and goes with his Datsun on a trip in the wilderness without warning his parents (William Hurt and Marcia Gay Harden) and sister. Unfortunately his car breaks and he goes hitchiking. From there on he will have some experiences; he will help a hippy couple rekindling their relationship, he will work for a while in an harvesting company owned by Wayne Westerberg (Vince Vaughn) until Wayne is arrested, he will met that couple again and becomes briefly friend with young country singer Tracy Tatro (Kristen Stewart), he meets Ron Franz (Hal Holbrook), a former General that lost his wife and works as a leather worker and asks him to be like his grandfather. After he leaves, he realizes that nature can be harsh and will end in a bad way.The acting is good by all. Hirsch is a likeable lead despite his decision and Hurt and a pre-TWILIGHT Kristen Stewart are good. But who stands out is Hal Holbrook as the widower who proposes Jacob to act like his grandfather and Jacob tells him to discuss about it when he'll return from Alaska. The photography is stunning and it makes you want to visit the places where it was filmed, and Penn directs nicely.Overall, a great movie that truly deserves all the praise and that stands its reputation. Highly recommended as it's a bit unusual as well.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Biography"
Where a young man with a wild heart makes a bad call.,"I read the book soon after it was published, in the mid-1990s, I think. It was an impressive piece of writing to chronicle the wanderings of the misguided Chris McCandless (played by Emile Hirsch) who finally decides to forgo all human contact in the wilds of Alaska. If nothing else, McCandless had the courage of his convictions, even if he was remarkably ill-prepared for his adventures.Convictions, however, can come back to bite you, unless you're prepared to learn from experience and change your ways. In that regard, the film fails to deliver the whole story. Hence, I'd urge interested viewers to get the book from a local library and read it – if not all of it (although, it's a relatively short non-fiction narrative), then definitely the end.The photography, though, is excellent. The acting by all the characters is very natural – indeed, almost flawless and with special mention for Hal Holbrook (as old Ron Franz) who has scenes with Hirsch that are truly amazing in their emotional effectiveness.Hirsch, of course, carries the film and story. I'd not seen him before in a film; without doubt, however, he is excellent in the role. Though, it would be instructive to see him in another story and context. Sean Pen produced and directed this and did a competent job for a pedestrian (no pun intended) story that some say is overlong. Perhaps it is.The film is remarkable for me from another aspect, however: with a total of fifty-four film locations, I think this film wins, hands down, as the one that's traveled to the most. Even the epic Lawrence of Arabia (1962) went to only thirty-two; and the other epic from that same year, The Longest Day, managed to get out to only a dozen or so. There is no Oscar for highest number of locations, though.Overall, though, I think, this type of film would have been better handled by Werner Herzog, famous for many fiction and non-fiction films – particularly Grizzly Man (2005), a documentary about another young man who thought he could live with wild bears. That's a better movie story than Into The Wild.However, if you want to see many barren and lonely parts of the USA, followed by the wild, forbidding beauty of Alaska, then do see this movie. Or, you could just see a National Geographic documentary, instead. For the whole story about Chris McCandless, though, get the book and read it.I recommend this film for Penn fans, mostly, and nature lovers.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Biography"

Will make you think,"Finally had a chance to watch the critically claimed Into The Wild.I kinda liked it but I also have mixed feelings regarding the story and the way it has been told.The movie which is based on real events,tells the story of Chris McCandless,played by Emile Hirch, a college graduate who rebels against society and its restrictions and despite having great grades,instead of enrolling in an university, donates his savings to charity and decides to live in the wild.His final destination is Alaska and along the way Chris meets a series of characters who shape his life.Some of them also learn from Chris and gain a new perspective on life.Its interesting to watch Chris's adventure but I would have liked to learn more about his beliefs and motivations.At some point in the movie Chris speaks about society and people in general,giving his opinion and discussing certain aspects of life and that was one of the most interesting scenes. That should have been explored a bit more so that as a viewer we could really understand what was going on trough his head and where he was coming from.We're told that his parents relationship which he considered fake was one of the reasons that led to his rebellion, he just didn't understand all the lies and became frustrated but it could not be just that, Chris had to have some very strong views about society otherwise he wouldn't just abandon everything and that's what I think would be interesting to know. Another complaint I have is, at some point in his journey Chris meets Tracy Tatro,played by Kristin Stewart, and they become very close(or so it seems).When Tracy gives the indication that she wants to sleep with Chris, he says he can't do it because she's a minor and it is against the law.Here we have someone that is rebelling against society and who is all about freedom and enjoying life, and when it comes to the most natural act between two people that love each other,sex, he refuses to do it because of the law? Something that society created? I just thought it was completely out of character.Apparently the real Chris and Tracy weren't atracted to each other but if Sean Penn is going to make it look like that he should at least make the scene consistent with the character's beliefs.Having said that, the film is beautifully shot,Emile Hirsch is great as Chris and so is Hal Holbrook as Ron Franz, one of the characters Christ meets in his journey and probably the most memorable one.I didn't love the soundtrack but I can't deny it suits the movie.Into The Wild is a film that really makes you think about your life,about happiness and its meaning,about our ""journey"" on earth and its a film that deserves to be watched.7.5/10",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Biography"
A fascinating journey of a selfish and stubborn man running away from himself,"Before I begin let me just state that this film is based on a true story so I will mention the outcome of the film. If you know the story you will know the outcome and if you don't maybe you should stop reading, although I'm sure the outcome is pretty obvious.Chris McCandless (Hirsch) is a young man who has just graduated from college and has the opportunity to move on to Harvard Law School, something his parents are extremely happy about. His parents seem to be of the pushy kind and the sort that believe that a career and money is worth more than humanity itself. It is shown that Chris has been lead down this path when he has dinner with his parents and he tells them he has twenty four thousand dollars saved up. His parents then go on to offer him a car but Chris' reaction to this, in that he rejects it outright, shows that he is a boy who wants to do it all on his own, so much so that once his parents leave him that is exactly what he does. He donates all his money to charity, chops his credit cards and ID, and burns any leftover cash in his pocket. He then climbs into his car and drives west as far as he can, before being wiped out by a flash flood. At this he sets out on foot in an attempt to realise a sudden dream; fleeing to Alaska and living in the solitary wild.The film begins with Chris already having achieved his goal; he stumbles across an old bus in the middle of the forest and uses it as his home, he hunts for deer as food and ensures that the bus is in a good liveable condition. We then flashback to the beginning from when he set off to each character he encounters on his journey. All of this is intertwined with the present moment of him in the forest. Along his journey he meets hippies, farmers, travellers and a lonely old man who each give him something valuable for when he is on his own, be it an item or information. All believe that his dream is crazy and their gifts come with warnings. At the end each gift and each warning have a huge part to play.The film does jump in the timeline. We see him meet a character, they give him his need, and then we move forward to the present and see him taking on this advice or trying to avoid their warning. The flashbacks build towards a happy dream that he is close to completing, and the present scenes in the forest show his depletion towards death. This man learns a valuable lesson of life as it drifts away from him.This is the sort of film that I find frustrating; one because it is something I would like to do, I couldn't think of nothing better than getting up and heading across the country and winging it. On the other hand I couldn't stand it when he clearly begins to struggle but is too stubborn to head out of the wilderness and find a way to his parents who would happily pay for him to get home. This probably frustrated me more as I couldn't understand why he was doing this too himself. I really enjoyed the idea of his journey but he seems to be on a suicide mission.Chris is not a likable character. I hate to say it as he technically was a real person, but he was selfish and willing to hurt anyone who got in his way. It is as if he gets him comeuppance at the end for following a stupid dream. The characters he meet all tell him this and all show good reason for him to stay with them but he won't. He has this idea that he will only be happy if he is alone. This is shown in a heart warming scene towards the end when he meets a lonely old man who sees him as a grandson, but Chris treads all over him and leaves him in tears. This was a huge problem for me in this film, I really disliked the character.That is not to say that the acting by Hirsch wasn't good because he was great in the role. He showed his selfish, stubborn side at the same time as being likable to the people on first impression. He also lost a lot of weight to portray the role which deserves a round of applause. There is also a great turn from Hal Holbrook who plays the old man, Ron. There one final scene really is touching.There wasn't enough in this film for me to say it is brilliant. Too much of it frustrated me and I didn't like the lead character. Some of the scenes seemed pointless which meant the overly long running time could have been slashed. It looks great and there are some truly touching moments, however it isn't enough to make me think it is a great film. It is simply about an arrogant, selfish boy attempting to flee his parents but all he really is becoming is just like them, bringing him to a worse off conclusion.3 / 5For more reviews: www.tolli-movieworld.blogspot.com",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Biography"
A Most Noble Effort,"While not nearly as good as the book, I commend Sean Penn's efforts as it must have been very difficult to adapt this tale of Chris McCandless's fatal Alaskan odyssey. Also worth mentioning is Eddie Vedder's superb acoustically-driven score, his first ever.As one might expect from a Penn movie, he casts many notable names, including William Hurt as the stereotypical cold father, Catherine Keener as a nomadic hippie, Vince Vaughn, and a surprisingly energetic Hal Holbrook. Emile Hirsch plays Chris decently enough, showing noticeable dedication (he must have really lost weight towards the end) but still does not stand out as much as the more veteran-like supporting cast.Penn includes some nice subtle touches, such as actual black and white footage of apartheid and other social and political crises of Africa as Chris's sister names out his final courses and grades from Emory University. At times he goes overboard though, indulging in clichés like an overhead shot of Chris swimming naked on his back with his arms stretched out like Jesus on the cross. I found the most powerful scene to be but a close-up photograph of the real Chris McCandless as he sat scruffy-bearded and grinning outside of the vacant bus he made his home, an enlarged and color version of the same photograph from inside the book.As I was finishing the book I thought this would make for a fascinating Werner Herzog documentary in the tradition of ""Grizzly Man."" McCandless falls into that same kind of iconoclastic realm as any one of Herzog's protagonists. Penn gives us the romanticized Hollywood version.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Biography"

Christopher McCandless, the main character, leaves everything behind but what he can carry and embarks on a journey across America that takes him to the wilds of Alaska.

"Thought-provoking, unforgettable, beautiful and unmissable.","This movie tells the story of Christopher McCandless, a brilliant student who burned his driver's license and credit cards, gave away all of his savings to charity and set off to find himself, traveling through the US under the nickname 'Alexander Supertramp'. Sean Penn's directional outings have earlier been relatively dark stories unfolded, but he has never been near so connected to the story as he's here - Penn gets under Chris' skin with a beautifully shot movie, keeping a thoughtful pace through its 2 hours and 25 minutes. The journey is fantastic, cutting himself from his estranged parents, Chris lets his wanderlust take him anywhere, he puts millions of miles under his heels as he encounters people and nature with charisma and adventurous belief - Emilie Hirsch executes the character perfectly, his deepened thoughts of Byron and Thoreau are poetically bent and his motivations seems unclear, so Penn relates to the grasping of Chris' roots to find the dark wake of the young man's sudden disappearance. And Penn uses Chris' narrating sister, Carine (Jena Malone) to reveal why he suddenly broke free from his parents and relatives - and as the months go by even his understanding sister starts questioning Chris and his motives, but she always reminds herself that this had to happen sometime, one way or the other Christopher McCandless was a restless soul who found solace in himself. But the history feels tragic when Chris realizes that he was wrong; he is in need for human connection all the way, but especially with the moving sequences of widower Ron Franz, Hal Holbrook's great portray is introduced as Chris' achievement of wisdom. Because Chris never tried reaching out for something so spiritually or heartfelt or deepened that he would sacrifice himself for the beauty of the wilderness and freedom of no nothing; at the very end he wrote an SOS in which he was in serious injury, and needed help. Christopher McCandless had a unique courage, and you can't help feeling affected as the movie's whispers will come back to you days after watching it. Rarely we see an American film so refreshed with love for the US yet somehow digging for something even stronger, darker and thoughtful with Chris' rapid soul in the crucial revelation - and the soundtrack of Eddie Vedder's remarkable songs gives Chris' another voice than his own, haunted and strong, dark and bright. 'Into the Wild' celebrates Christopher McCandless, for everything he stood for and everything he did.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Biography"
Mainly Pointless,"The film was a well-written, had great acting and great directing but this all went towards telling a mostly pointless story. Similar movies could have been made about any of a million emotionally troubled homeless people. I think that this particular troubled homeless man's story got made into a film for two reasons. He liked to quote literature, giving the writer a handy device for revealing the protagonists thoughts concisely and poetically. He also chose to be homeless in scenic locations which made for a pretty movie.The movie is worth seeing for all of its good qualities, just don't expect to gain any insights into the human condition, or to see a character learn and grow in any meaningful way. For my money The Razor's Edge was a much more interesting film in the same genre.I'm not suggesting that the story of Into the Wild should have veered from reality to make it more interesting.

But I can watch scenery via virtually any of the thousands of travelogues which are available.

The movie is so human-centric, so value-centric, it touches you right on your innermost conscience. I salute Sean & John for giving me not only a wonderful masterpiece, but also for giving me a lesson in life! Although this movie deserves all the accolades, but anticipating that in itself will be a dishonor to the movie. Its beyond awards, and all the materialistic notion that world has set as a yardstick to measure the merit of a movie. Its to be felt, deep within.If every person imbibes little bit of Chris in themselves, the world will be a much better place. The fact that its a true story (which I didn't know until I saw it), affects you even more.

"Lovely film, makes you think.","First off, this film and especially Hal Holbrook are Oscar material in my mind. Hal's character was perfectly cast and perfectly well done. Exceedingly believable and quite touching. Kudos to the director, casting person, and to Mr. Holbrook. I suspect this will be another highlight of Mr Holbrooks career. Along with his Mark Twain effort. Holbrook deserves an Oscar. I was quite moved.That being said, this movie is not judgmental. It presents the story in an even handed way. You the viewer, decides who is ""evil"" and who is not. The many critiques or kudos here are based on peoples own perceptions and filtered through their own time and place in their mental, ethical and chronological and societal place.Younger people may see the main character as stupid or wonderfully idealistic.To me it was the story of a young man, who is idealistic, and genial, at the same time, who can not make any meaningful connections due to..youth, and trouble in his background. And makes some mistakes along the way as young people will.In his travels he has opportunity to grow spiritually. Does he succeed?

When I heard it was to be a film, I was both fascinated and worried about how it would translate to the screen -- particularly the inner struggles and thoughts of Chris McCandless that took him on his tragic quest, and the complex relationships in his life.Penn really captured the rich tapestry of this story. Pure genius.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Biography"
A well made but tragic tale.,"I might not see this film in the same light as many others see it, not because of anything technical, the acting, or the decisions Sean Penn made in adapting and directing.I simply think that the main character isn't the anti-establishment hero that he is perhaps made out to be, but a young man who let his blind yet admirable adherence to principle rob him of opportunities. Not opportunities to make money or meet chicks or garner admiration from strangers, (but at the same time all three), just a boy who never had the chance to see what he might become.Emile Hirsch is this ""boy"", Chris McCandless, later calling himself Alex Supertramp in a further sign that perhaps he wasn't the mature man he thought he was. I initially found it amusing that Hirsch got this role, thinking almost everything these days goes to Shia Lebouf, despite the fact that he is yet to be entertaining in anything and in fact is downright annoying in most films he has appeared in! The plot is simple because it is a true story, young Chris graduates and instead of following the American Dream and going to college he decides to drop off the face of the Earth and just exist. He doesn't tell his family, burns his money and trashes his car, so why does he keep his clothes and other possessions? Surely roaming naked and free through life is the purest one can be? Also if Chris is such a fan of the environment and is in a position to make a difference with his passion and superior intellect, why does he then ignore that opportunity and remove himself from the system? Regardless Chris and his clothes head off and just slum through life for the remainder of his, picking up odd jobs here and there and interacting with various locals and fellow drifters with the main aim of going to Alaska by himself with only his wits to protect him. There are many flashbacks to various parts of the last years of Chris's life for obvious reasons, as the final stages have a despairing sense of inevitability about them and they would even be more depressing if allowed to run their course.Hints are given to Chris's decision making process by flashbacks involving his family, who while well intentioned appear to have high expectations as a minimum for Chris's future, which is an outlook I'm sure many parents would share. Given the fact that this is a screen version of real events a subtle variance in their demeanor could alter the viewer's perception significantly one way or the other. I would think the director might be prone to wanting a less forgiving view of the parents to further justify the actions of young Supertramp, as that is more romantic than the notion of a young bloke with a promising future dissing his parents, burning his cash and changing his name to Alex Supertramp.Well I'm just saying.Once in Alaska Supertramp finds the Magic Bus, a deserted shell of a schoolbus that serves as shelter and home. While there he uses his accumulated knowledge and smarts to exist, though he becomes unkempt, unshaven and most alarmingly malnourished, and again it is more and more evident that there will be no happy ending.Supertramp has undeniable charm and the allure that rebels seem to garner, but the movie is kept alive by the many bit parts of those he comes into contact with along the way. Vince Vaughn plays an employer that sees what Chris has in store and vainly tries to talk him out of it. Catherine Keener and Brian Dierker play a middle aged hippie couple that are cruising through life without ever really truly roughing it, and most notably Kristen Stewart plays a young teen who would be Supertramp's love interest if he wasn't jest so damn principled! I have scanned a few reviews when I saw that on IMDb this is one of the Top 250 all time rated flicks, and while I don't disagree that this is a fine film I can't see where the extra point or so comes from. Into the Wild is a sad film, as Supertramp left the security of home to find himself, and overreached his abilities to tragic effect. It is worth noting that despite all the romance and high mindedness of young Chris McCandless the note that was actually left on the Magic Bus where his body was found was a desperate SOS message, not a noble statement of belief, it is amazing that a couple of minor decisions in editing and direction can perhaps elevate a tragic story into one of martyrdom.Final Rating – 7 / 10. A fine film involving tragic subject matter made specifically to lionise Chris McCandless. Hopefully if nothing else it inspires someone to pause for thought before venturing out, rather than sending other young people on a misguided adventure to find themselves.If you liked this review (or even if you didn't) check out oneguyrambling.com",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Biography"

Wonderful to watch. Difficult to discern.,"A tale of self-discovery and caution. Life is a hard hand. Life is a forced hand. And more often than not, we are dealt cards that don't make sense to us. Such was the story of Christopher Johnson McCandless. His soul, that of an adventurer, had never belonged to the world he'd grown up in. And so, as the cage opened, the bird flew away. It's only mistake? It had never known the nuances of flying.There's a limit to everything. Freedom, adventure and even extremism. And the story of McCandless, or Alexander Supertramp as he called himself, is a reminder to all of us that too much of anything, is really bad.Wonderful settings, a fine account of the wilderness and of different exotic pocket worlds that exist independent of the conventions of our society, make this a fine picaresque tale. On the negative aspects, the movie is perhaps, on the whole, a little vague and the exact evolutions within McCandless are difficult to discern.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Biography"
Best movie I've seen in a long time,"Could have shaved 45 minutes with no lack of message but through time you learned why he put himself through all this.

McCandless searching and found the answer to happiness (you'll find out in movie) and wrote it in his log, after it was too late to escape wilderness.Academy award nominations for Hirsch, Holbrook (supporting) and Penn (screenplay.) Hirsch very good choice for lead----his own youth and on-screen, wide-eyed innocence added much to the movie! Holbrook's age, experience and acting ability made the scenes he and Hirsch shared memorable. I did not read the book prior to the movie but will.Note: Sad point not addressed in movie is the fact that McCandless could have escaped over ""the river"" by simply walking 1/4 mile south of where he crossed in the beginning by using built-in cable cross!!!!! Don't know why Penn did not address that in movie. It would have had a great impact. Otherwise, very moving---tears in audience. Movie a reflection of true life----goodness and purity of heart means nothing when it comes to survival, especially survival of the fittest. Reflect and learn.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Biography"
Another way to look into one of the most interesting stories around.,"On August 18 1992, Chris McCandless died in the Alaskan wilderness and his body was discovered a month later. He was a 24 year old guy who was born in California and who ended up graduating high school in Virginia and then went to Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia. He was a guy who eventually went to Arizona and South Dakota getting rides by hitchhiking, living only off the land and working only small jobs or no jobs at all. He then goes off to Alaska in the very harsh, cold wilderness and seemingly very unprepared for the journey.This is one of the most interesting death stories around and it is still filled with many unanswered questions. The story was later made into a non-fiction book Into the Wild in 1997 written by Jon Krakauer which later turned into a best seller. The film adaption came later in 2007.A film adaption of this story to me would seem risky. It is a story based on thought and emotion and learning how to live out in the wilderness. He might have a fine acting career but it is little funny to see that Sean Penn directed this. Even more, Chris McCandless is more a mystery character to portray because we really never got many answers about him.Well Into the Wild is full of ups and downs but it comes out well in the end.I give credit to Sean Penn who picks the right Christopher McCandless in Emile Hirsch. Hirsch is an actor who can deliver all the emotions that this character needs to bring to the story. McCandless is hard to root for but at the same time, you should be interested in the character because he is like no other. Kristen Stewart plays Tracy Taro as a love interest who is ultimately rushed here and hers is a character you wished saw more of. Hal Holbrook plays Ron Frantz, an older generation guy who picks up Chris as a hitchhiker and forms a very strong bond with him. Even Vice Vaughn shows up as Wayne Westerberg, McCanndless' best friend in North Dakota. The cast is filled with old stars, current stars and unknown stars at the time but ultimately all play good characters.Along the way, this is a film that works on atmosphere. From the seeing California nudists in the valley, to watching McCandless canyoning up the Arizona channel and to the Alaskan wilderness, culture shock comes into play here and that is not necessarily a bad thing.I don't see Into the Wild as high re-watch film because of it's sad subject matter. Still though, this works for fans of the book and also for people that didn't read the book for that matter. It is another way to look into one of the most interesting stories around.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Biography"
Into Perfection,"Director Sean Penn delivers the most beautiful film to enter theaters in decades, Into the Wild. Starring newcomer Emile Hirsch as Christopher, a recent graduate of Emory University who decides to pick up and leave behind the material possessions of the world and walk the Earth. Based on a true story, Christopher 's life ends in tragedy but alas, there is no tragedy in the film, rather the essence of exquisiteness of the world as Christopher shows us everything we should be in awe about, that surrounds us every day.One of the best cast ensembles constructed this year, Penn gives each of his actor's a objective and draws it out of them like a needle. Hirsch's character, being the most examined obviously, carries the film on his shoulders as other great thespians have in the past like Adrien Brody in The Pianist and Tom Hanks in Cast Away. Hirsch holds no boundaries in obtaining Christopher's most sensitive areas and engulfing them in himself as if possessed by the man. As he travels the states, he meets a slew of characters along the way.Vince Vaughn showing us his dramatic acting chops, embodies a quality not seen by the actor before. Performances in films like Wedding Crashers, which I thought was brilliant and The Break-Up has put him in a boat Jim Carrey can't seem to get out of. Vaughn is more than comedy here, he's performing a man who you love to love, a man who's flaws don't carry any weight in caring for him. Maybe Vaughn's transition will be better and smoother than Carrey's.Catherine Keener, who has been on my bad list as of late for her mediocre nominated performance in Capote, as completely revolutionized her acting game. With a sense of grace and splendor, Keener shows she can inhabit a character and let her ware on her soul. You can see pain and joy throughout the film, and when she's off screen you can't wait until you see her again. When she returns, you're overcome with joy because you knows Christopher is in safe hands.Young talents, Kristin Stewart and especially Jena Malone are sensational. Stewart as the smitten young girl in need of love is heartbreaking altogether. Malone who has showed some promise in her earlier career with performances in Stepmom and Saved! shows something original and tender as Christopher's estranged sister. As she narrates the picture, you can hear the passion and desolation in her voice. As she tries to gives us insight into her family's world and the reasoning behind Christopher's exit, we're shown the tragedy of the American lifestyle everyone so desperately yearns for. Money, wealth, and materials cannot buy love, compassion, and safety. William Hurt and Marcia Gay Harden hold those images to heart as they give their performances as Chris' parents.It's in the final twenty minutes in the film when Christopher meets his last major human contact. A old man exemplifying loneliness to the most potent degree and humanity in the most striking wonders. Hal Holbrook takes on this role and completely shatters all acting competition and gives on the best performances of the year and by far, his career. Holbrook, showing anguish in his eyes, layers the character with emotion upon emotion. Its in his finale encounter with Christopher he seals the award for Best Supporting Actor at this year's Academy Awards.As stated before, Penn's direction here even though forceful in audience's attention, is no laughing matter. He ranks himself amongst the greats of other directors, Clint Eastwood, Sidney Lumet, etc. As powerful as he usually is in front of the camera, he's even more effective behind it. Into the Wild, is truly the most breathtaking and moving film of the year. All should experience it, and I myself, wish that I could live if a ¼ of what this man did in his final years of his life.Grade: ****/****",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Biography"
Good but too many stereotypes,"This movie has definitely got something that appeals, but the characters (even the city of Los Angeles) are too one-dimensional and seem provided only to live up to their stereotypes. The abusive father, suffering mother, understanding sister, violent railroad cop, aging hippies, naked druggies, wild Scandinavians, ugly cities, LA yuppies, lonely old man, and so on. Chris wanders through a landscape of stereotypes whose only purpose is to provide a foil for Chris to react to, typically with something intended to be profound. None of these characters convey any sense of depth except perhaps the one played by Catherine Keener. It may have been deliberate on Sean Penn's part to present these people in this way so that Chris, by comparison, seems deep, but for me it made the film much less than it could have been.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Biography"
To live a simple life,"What a brand new masterpiece, the story is full of adventure and life, it brings us back to nature - the beautiful side of the world.We got to recognize the society is getting interrupted by the market system. People has already forgot what they dream for. The ultimate goal of life is not about money, but about the value deep inside your heart. The film is well made with many different views about life learned throughout the grow-up of the boy, it raises the concern between sacrificing nature to get better development in city. We have lost ourselves in a blurred vision of society, and let the ""empty hole"" dominating us and motivating us to work and give up enjoying the nice pieces around us.Like ""Cars"", it gets us to know what time to stop and look around the things you have in hand. Everyone is stuck into a puzzle they cannot give up the social perception or the belief not to go away for a try to involve in the world. It does give us surprise if we learn how to makes friend with it. We don't always be jammed in car congestion, or being upset for a salary cut and unable to purchase food in high-class restaurants. Have a wider vision, the world is different to us.There is always strong struggle between the operation of society and preservation of nature. Every human should be of the same status. Every one single man is valuable. What I have been touched in the scene that a guard has caught Christopher for taking the train, just because he doesn't have money or an identity even. In today's world, you have to take up every issues by the useless papers and some rubbish cards. Just one small paper can get you into paradise or to the hell. Identity cards, passports, cheques, ... from when on did people give so many limitations to themselves?The theme of film brought about is what I enjoy and agree very much. It is the definition of happiness. Definitely of much deeper study in happiness than ""Pursuit of Happiness"". Happiness does not come from money, it also cannot come from independence. God creates the world and get people to enjoy, but not their own selves. From the movie, the most enjoyable moments are the time when Christopher meets every new people in a spot. ""Happiness comes true only when shared."" It shows great Christianity and nature in the movie. The ""God Bless Us"" in the backside, the salvation village has got the characters and audience relaxed.The superb landscape and marvelous natural world has fascinated me in the complete 120 minutes. It is fun and documentary-like, filming of animals and plants captured in the character's journey, recording of daily conversations with new friends met in his trip. Thanks to the cameramen and editors, shots on the beach or sea are so smooth and genuine, it is like a real travel show but brings meaning to life.It could be named as ""No Country For Young Man"". The young guy needs to take risk and go everywhere he likes, regardless of the limit society has hanged on to him, regardless of his parents. He really does a ""jumper"" job: Everywhere is possible. In the world we find no place for a young and active person to go free, freedom should be the right to born with, however, life is not under control by oneself. All are obliged to regulations and instructions. Set by whom? God even would not stop us to go on our own way. The territories should not once be there.It's time to change old men's rules.

Great movie,"Realistic picture of the damages of loving parents who makes mistakes and child who think to be better but make even bigger mistakes. This movie is about tue effects that we have on the others and the seek of happiness. Sone scenes are a mixture of poetry and wonderful photography. The travel of the main character is not that interesting and sone relationships with other secondary characters may be explored more. It seemed like no one really tried to convince christopher that he was wrong, only Ron suggested a different point of view but the conversation ended immediately with a laugh. At the beginning the movie talked too much about our economy and the value of money but luckily the focus shifted on the externalities that our actions have on the world that surround us.Can't give more than 7 because it is not as profound and entertaining to deserve an 8, but it is a full 7 (also a 7.8 if I could have used decimals)",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Biography"

It means that these scenes are memorable in their own way. For me, they are usually based on the dialogue.""Into the Wild"" does not produce either of these traits. It produces the most important part of storytelling. It sucks the listener into the story so much that they lose track of what is real and what is not. The listener may forget they are watching, instead of living, the life of Chris McCandless. With every fall, you fall with him.

A movie to remember,"Into The Wild was one of those movies that I started watching without any expectations, and that I finished with the minutes of reflective thoughts, just letting the end credits pass by, that I maybe had subconsciously waited for, all along this biographical drama by Sean Penn.This movie is definitely worth seeing, not only for advocates of long, breathtaking natural scenes or romantic adventurers, but also for the common consumer with a natural desire for an enthralling story.Penn kept me up asking myself why someone would do this kind of an extreme self-discovery trip, far away from civilization, while, at the same time, having a deep understanding for the protagonist's motives. However, I could feel with the main character, but not really identify with him. But maybe this is exactly the thing that makes this movie interesting. Chris McCandless reflects the part of ourselves that would be ready to follow his path, while our common sense is pretty happy to be situated in front of a screen.Finally, Into The Wild is a movie that you remember. Maybe not when you're on business lunch or on a shopping trip.

Astonishing,"There are hundreds of inspirational movies made, ones with people that somehow teach the underprivileged unteachable, basketball teams that overcome odds. This movie is inspirational in that it tugs at you to be something better, to step outside of yourself and your comfort zone, without the warm fuzzy outcomes.I went to see this movie with no preconceptions; I haven't read the book and only knew that Emile Hirsch was in it. I was really just astonished at the magnitude of the whole thing. This movie takes on a story and locations that needed to be huge and totally embraces it. Every scene is shot beautifully, with some really breathtaking moments. The acting is great, Hirsch is completely believable, Hal Holbrook is heartbreakingly wonderful, and of course Marcia Gay Harden and William Hurt are always great. The relationship between Hirsch and Catherine Keener plays perfectly. I was surprised at how long the film went on (2 and 1/2 hours) but couldn't think of anything that didn't need to be there.The thing that I found so great about this movie was its relevance. Though I doubt many people are so eager to go put themselves in such dangerous wilderness, the sentiment hits close to home. In an age of devout commercialism I think most people can understand the urge to try to find something pure in the world.

the stories he could have told us,"This tears the heart. We grift and stumble to survive and our children are the witnesses. What they learn from us, or their schooling, or their experiences, forms them and has to get them through. But the human spirit is stubbornly selfish. Naive. Methodical. McCandless may have shed some of his parent's superficial values (money, social climbing, prestige), but the deeper deficiencies remain. It's still all about HIM.So here he is, struggling both to hatch into adulthood and to stay in his protective, selfish shell. In a fitting metaphor, he literally dies in that shell - cocooned in a mummy bag, inside an old bus. Yes, he is a fool, but he is our own uniquely American-made fool.It is fitting that many of the characters in the movie save him, by feeding him and sheltering him, but all this does is delay his self-destruction. If he had survived, what stories he would have had to tell, what a life he would have had to live.Kudos to the actors and the writers. Especially kudos for the cinematography. Ultimately it's the wide-open beauty of America that baited and lured McCandless to his doom. Finally many thanks to Ziggy in Anchorage for his excellent belt-work.

Stray Dog,"I think I finally found the best picture of this decade. To be honest, I can't think of another film right now that has had such a deep personal impact on me. Ironically, I didn't have much interest in Penn's work as director before, so I missed Into the Wild's theatrical release. My date picked it up at the library without me knowing and, while we were watching, it hit me completely unexpected and left me quite dumbfounded, in a positive way. I always knew it, spontaneous love is real love! For me, the film is perfect and nothing less and I'll try to explain a little why that is...So, I made clear so far that I think Sean Penn's Into the Wild is a masterpiece which I'm sure, at least nowadays, can't be surpassed at all by emotional impact, wisdom and profundity. At the same time, it's a film that carries great weight for myself (to an extent that only Badlands and Summer with Monika reach, maybe not even those): At one point in my life I had similar thoughts spooking through my mind like the protagonist, Alex Supertramp, had. I was never brave enough to make the next step, though.Into the Wild is an universal tragedy about love itself, its endless possibilities and, at the same time, its total failure. Usually, after quarrels about continuing or beginning a love relationship most films end in a way that the doubting person goes on a journey to the essence of his/her yearning which can be an extended walk through the city, bar-hopping or even a spontaneous plane trip to finally dissolve all remaining questions and doubts in a kiss or an emotional confession. Here, we don't have this kind of cathartic ending, because the redeeming insight, that one is only happy who can share the luck with others, comes to Alex at a time, ""lonely, scared"", when it is well-nigh impossible for him to make it true.All the persons that run across the idealistic adventurer Alex during his trip give him reasons to (re-)appreciate individual freedom which pushes ahead his journey forth and forth. What he doesn't see is that all these people actually fill the gaps of affection that Alex missed at his parental home. He, his head full and burdened with dreams, fails to see that he would have found what he was longing for all the time: The loving mother (Keener), the wise father (Holbrook), the passionate girlfriend (Kristen Stewart), the daring brother (Vaughn). The relationships to everyone Alex meets are built up in an extremely touching and sensitive way and, after a short time, are dissolved in painful moments of leaving. Freedom has its price, a price that Alex does not realize and therefore does not have to pay. It's nothing that I can accuse him of, though, because he is an intrepid dreamer who acts out of emotions and that makes him utterly likable. At the same time, it's easy to see that Alex' ideas are enraptured from this world. The mournful landscape panoramas are wonderfully shot by Eric Gautier, often in meditative slow motion with Alex in focus. He seems to deliquesce in the beauty of nature when the camera circles above around his head, releasing a view to the vast mountains of Alaska, a melting that looks and feels breathtaking, but actually paves the way for Alex' downfall. Eternal love pays the price when it is scratching its fingers bleedingly at the abrasive walls of reality - especially when the opposite is the wilderness, always only a mirror and not the receiver of one's own passions. That is the price which causes Alex' death at the end and a broken heart in everybody he left behind.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Biography"
"Talk about freedom, add a nice landscape and country music - instant success","I'm starting to see a pattern here. I was recommended this movie by a friend of mine who thought it was great. I have a lot of free time at work (ha!) so I decided to watch it. It didn't move me much. People seems to see here the realization of their own secret desires and dreams. I only see a young fellow who decides to escape his problems and, simply, be selfish. There's a trend: a ""normal"" person watches a film about a ""free spirit"" doing what he wants to do and the viewer believes that the story is great, regardless how easy it is to actually do what you want, to be who you want to be. The only problem is that it's even easier to follow society's rules and simply being frustrated and emotionally castrated. Sorry about the Freudian analysis. However, it's impossible to properly review this tile (any title?) without understanding why anybody would find it attractive. This is the story of a scared boy who chooses to run away from his social responsibilities. As simply as that. If people find this brilliant because they cannot do it themselves, fair enough. I won't base a criticism on my personal failures though. There's no real morality here, no big teaching, only common sense. That might be already too much for most of the people I guess, alright. Anyway, that's how it is. Beautiful photography nevertheless. Alas, I didn't feel attached to any of the characters in this film and, honestly, couldn't care less if it's based on a true story. I can understand why this movie is so loved. And also why it's overrated.

Scenic Vistas That Will Expand Your Horizons!,"Sean Penn has given those adventurous enough to see Into The Wild a prodigious/edifying epic.

He acts well beyond his years. The remaining cast is too numerous to list, but they all turn in fabulous work. Christopher graduates from college, has some money saved, looks back at his past, decides a charity could use the money in a good way, gives one a check, burns all his previous ties to everyday ho-hum life after he recalled his upbringing and not necessarily wanting his children to have to be put through the same stuff. After eliminating the identifying markers from himself to the past, he wanders through South Dakota, Arizona, and Mexico before heading to Alaska.This movie has too many philosophical points brought up and dealt with to name here or mar your own viewing pleasure, but I will boldly and forcefully say that any self-respecting movie lover will be in awe while leaving the theater afterward.

"Wild, a bit weird, pretty wonderous","The narrative of ""Into the Wild"" wants to force a story; a digestible, vapid plot to explain Christopher McCandless' curious motivations.However, this story does move itself, meandering in a fashion akin to the river Emile Hirsch's character navigates. I was invested in was the personal journey: people met incidentally, experiences endured, and the culmination of someone living a life by their own hand.As true stories go, it's an understated tale - one man going it alone, hitchhiking and traipsing across North America. It taps into a thought that has crossed every person's mind at some point, considering how they'd fare if they did abandon everything they consider regular.Throughout this journey, all the vistas of America's varied tapestry is on full display, from the immaculate snows of the Yukon to the desolate desert bowls of Mexico, but I don't know if they were employed to their fullest potentials.It is, at its heart, a human story. Christopher (supposedly) wants to escape the rat race, disillusioned by his parents' over reliance on materialism and emotional restraint. I do, however, take fault with the very forced human interactions that were probably few and far between, particularly a romantically-inclined side arc that felt pretty obtuse.""Into the Wild"" is a narrative on inner conflict. McCandless seeks solitude, but loves to help everyone he meets.By the finish, I was more sympathetic that this was probably someone who felt deep abandonment, and succumbed to an interminable desire to disappear.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Biography"

A decent story,"The 2007 film, Into the Wild, is a reflection of director Sean Penn's ability to put you in the shoes of the character. In this case, the character is Chris McCandless, a man who ventured out in a search for himself after graduating college in May 1990.Overall, a good story, but the film does move rather slow at times. Chris McCandless, played by Emile Hirsch, meets many different people along his journey. The film is basically a reflection of how McCandless viewed his adventure in the context of the people he meets along the way. The film is narrated by McCandless sister, played by Jena Malone.The main criticism of the film is Sean Penn's interpretation is just that, his interpretation. I have not read the book, but research I looked up suggests the author takes a more objective look at Chris McCandless.I had heard about this movie for a long time, but until I read a news story about the famed bus in the movie being removed a few days ago I had never got a chance to watch the movie.Overall a good film, but one that left me wondering how much Hollywood influence was behind the story. The film's interpretation will leave you wondering how much came from Chris McCandless and how much came from the author and director who made a book and film about him.Even at 2 and a half hours, I recommend seeing this movie.

The music, contributed by Eddie Vedder is astonishingly good and fits perfectly within the scenes. Arguably the finest example of American film in recent memory. Unquestionably the best work of Penn's career, in front or behind the camera.

"Egomaniac, celebrated as a hero","When something is celebrated by the majority of people, it's usually advisable to take a closer look at it.This movie was recommended in my ""critical thinking"" class in university, so we watched it. Let me prephase this by saying I gave it 2 stars rather than 1 for the acting and scenery.The movie is about a guy that is unhappy with his life and wants to ""really live"". Consequently, he burns (WHY? WHY not donate?) his money and moves into the woods. Not really though, because he lives in a school bus.Apparently, ""really living"" also means not caring in the slightest about anyone, including your mom, who has no idea where you are. Would it really have hurt to let her know?! Really?Just rebelling and going ""against everything"" without a second thought or purpose is for 13-year-olds. Not for grown men trying to go against the grid.Whenever you encounter some fan of this movie they tell you you just ""did not understand"" it. Which is kind of the easiest reasoning to come up with to degrade someone else who has differing opinions.Please take that critical thinking a step further and don't stop it ""doing everything different than the norm is critical and therefore great"".",2.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Biography"
The best movie I've ever seen,"I agree with all the comments about the kid being stupid, ill-prepared, inconsiderate and a spoiled brat. People who leave their critique at that are correct, but missed a lot of deeper meanings provided in this masterpiece. Sean Penn you are to be commended. I believe you did justice to the book and were honest to the story. The acting was superb. Hirsch, Keener, Holbrook make this movie sing. One person who I don't hear a lot of mention for is Brian Dierker(Rainey). For only being his first acting role, he was very good. Vedder's music and singing were perfect for this film. The cinematography was stunning. I've seen ""No Country""... and in my opinion does not even touch ""Wild"" I have not seen ""There will be blood"", only trailers. But it seems to win the Oscar for acting you have to be over the top or over act in my opinion like Daniel Day-Lewis's role, almost like a cartoon character. The actors in ""wild"" did not over-act, but brought real feelings thru about real people. It is truly a shame that ""Wild"" did not get more nominations, as it definitely got snubbed.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Biography"

Into The ...Camera?,"At first, I suffered the delusion that the main character was an annoying go getter who worried too much about people being selfish and materialistic. But little does the audience know, Sean Penn is just an A-hole and likes to shove family drama in your face till you're drenched in tears. However long it takes you to get over the fact that the movie has a message and that if you're one of those people to judge the character by his actions only, and not the lesson to be learned in the end, then just leave the movie theater and don't look back. Honestly, this film is what film makers should look forward to conceiving and retiring from.Although Emile Hirch doesn't put together an Oscar worthy performance, one that will turn heads like Cate Blanchett's winded and terrific Elizabeth, or Benicio Del Torro's addict antics, he sustains character throughout and gives a performance that is memorable in the fact that as the man he plays grows, you see him grow as well. And speaking of the character, he's straightforward but still very intriguing. Alexander Supertramp otherwise known as Alex Maccendless, needed an escape from his home sweet home, for reasons that seem to be on the surface, but are actually revealed to be deeper in the end.The people around him, the people he meets and loves and changes are so real and a-typical, that the actors seem lost in some kind of delusion that they may actually be a hippie, or a man that just got busted for watching illegal satellite television. I'd go on but I woudn't want to spoil any kind of archetype you may be waiting for.The movie, with it's much needed and refreshing meaningful shots of our protagonists point of view expressed through heavy nature watching and blunt nudity, is something that you do not see in cinema anymore, unless it's done badly by an indie or art director trying to be angst. It feels as if this movie leaps ahead of its budget and production and attempts to send you it's final message, revealed in its final chapter, as an actual morally defined and virtuous one. Though a big deal that Penn made with the main character was that he looked into the camera a lot which i fond strange, but oddly balanced at the same time. And I mean balanced as in the fact that it may have taken itself a little seriously at times, but it did loss en up a bit, god bold, and the fourth wall, though still broken, gave a realness to the character.Though the ending will leave you feeling sore and some numb, you will eventually come around to learn that the lesson that must be learned, must be lived first, and if it takes a cast like this to express it on film, then by damn, let it be learned and expressed.""True Happiness can only be achieved when you have someone to share it with.""",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Biography"
Brilliant movie,"A must watch for all movie buffs. Sean Penn has made a beautiful work of art from a beautiful story. The biography of Christopher McCandless as he journey's across America to find the true and complete meaning of freedom, love and life in the most basic form of existence has been portrayed beautifully by Emile Hirsch in this movie which is based on the book with the same name by Jon Krakauer. The music is also brilliantly made by Eddie Vedder and suits the movie in all ways. It is a very inspiring film in a very unreal way i.e. it makes you feel like going out there into the wild and finding the true meaning of life as a free man.

An Almost Buddhist Like Oddyssey,"When Sean Penn directed his first feature film, 'The Crossing Guard', some years back, I thought to myself, ""this is someone I think will go places as a director"". He has managed to craft himself a finer than fine film about a young man (played by Emille Hirsch)who is dissatisfied with the material world & strives to find a more pure existence in life. He gives away most of his belongings (including a sizable cash inheritance),takes up a backpack & takes to the open road to find himself. Along the way,he meets up with a variety of people (some good,others not so good,and some really bad). Does he find his proverbial nirvana? Well,you'll just have to see it to find out for yourself. The photography is a treat for the eye. The film is a bit long (140 minutes),but don't let that throw you.

No need for popular psychology in this movie,"I understand the needs for reasoning such abnormal and extreme behavior but, I don't think that his family and childhood experiences are the reason for that.

I think that Chris was a very sensitive person, and perhaps, too sensitive for our tough society....I guess escaping to the wild will be the best solution for those who constantly suffers the unfairness of being. So I would personally prefer the movie without all that popular psychology and put some more emphasis on his unique and special personality, that is an extraordinary sensitiveness combined with a beautiful and idealistic mind.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Biography"

Like Grizzly Man in his naive love of wildness,"A disturbingly interesting film directed by Sean Penn, and very true to the original book. We all can relate to the true story lead character Chris McCandless(he changed his name to Alexander Supertramp for his sojourns), innocent, naive and youthfully stupid as we all were at that age, expecting the whole world and it's peoples to be our friend and nurturer and helpfully allow us to create a personal Utopia. Sadly, when we finally grow up, we see life doesn't turn out that way. It's filled with a lot of hard work and compromises, which we start to see realistically somewhere in our mid-20's or so. Alex didn't get old enough to see that truth, as he and Grizzly Man met the same fate due to poor judgement coming from just being young and dumb, and not seeing that their youthful utopian world view must be adjusted, compromised and modified greatly in order to live successfully later on in this world. Even most 60's hippies(the smart ones) who did the same vagabond thing saw that eventually. It seems to be human nature for the young to never seem to gain much insight from the previous generation's experiences even though they are basically very similar down through the ages.Just like those 60's hippies, Alex hit the road as a vagabond and fell into many interesting adventures with oddball characters along the way. The story had all the usual trite causative and motivational bells and whistles behind it....bad parents(bad I guess because they were rich and successful)who did fight a lot, a cloyingly close sister(Hmmmm)who narrated the story, a liberal college degree, and no money problems at all growing up that may have protected him from the more practical world and life views of the less fortunate.Thus the eventual Supertramp wanderer developed a serious hate of our capitalistic system(anything better out there?), and decided to live his life as a road tramp, working temp only when he needed the hated dollar in order to live and travel, and eventually get enough savvy and $$$ to get to Alaska where all the best things in life resided(in his mind)........beautiful scenery, wilderness, living off the land, no people, no need for money.........but also, 45 below zero winters, little natural food, no sufficient shelter(an old, uninsulated school bus in the middle of nowhere?), no one to talk to or love(he seemed asexual anyway), flooded rivers hemming him in so he couldn't go anywhere else much of the time. As he went to Alaska mostly unprepared for anything bad that could happen, it's too bad Chris didn't see a film like this one to discourage him before he went there and paid for for it with his life.Emile Hirsch did a great job in the role of Supertramp, as he had the air of innocent confidence that Chris obviously had in order to undertake such a journey. Also, great road characters abounded in the film story, with Vince Vaughn and Catherine Keener and Hal Holbrook showing off as, respectively, a funny and sympathetic South Dakota farmer... a loving, aging hippie vagabond and flea market rat.... and an old desert-rat retiree who developed intense fatherly feelings for Chris and knew that Chris was headed for a bad ending. All helped and cared for Chris along the way as he prepared for his great and final Alaska adventure. The film had many beautiful scenes throughout of skies, deserts, rivers, mountains, tundra and ......of course......beautiful, but deadly Alaska for the unprepared.I read the book so I knew the ending..... and just as in Grizzly Man, a lot of naive and emotionally-driven mistakes can get you killed, even if they seemed good at the time. Penn showed all of this well in his film and I recommend it, but don't go if you want a feel-good Hollywood ending, as it definitely does not have it.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Biography"

"""He's leaving home, bye, bye"".....the quest for IT....","ON THE ROAD by Jack Kerouac was published 50 years before this film came out. And then there was Voltaire's CANDIDE. Can the Enlightenment be so very far away? A lot of people get irritated with Holden Caufield when they read CATCHER IN THE RYE. A lot of people react the same way when they encounter Christopher McCandless and they WILL encounter his persona on screen for years to come, thanks to Sean Penn. Why this irritation? It's like asking why the squares got irritated with the gatherings of gentle people at Monterey Pop during that ""Summer of Love"" in 1967 Frisco : in essence, people like Christopher McCandless remind them of their own ""lives of quiet desperation"" of what 60s freaks called, ""the death culture"".Christopher McCandless is a well read guy. He pulls out his Jack London and Leo Tolstoy in order to be closer, to relax with his friends. He's had it with what Holden Caufield called,""phonies"" and these include his lying parents. Generation gap redux, mai oui.Christopher McCandless wants to discover Truth. And to do this, he ventures out ""on the road"" as Dean Moriarity and Sal Paradise did in 1947, hitching and driving and being driven all over America and even down to Mexico, just as Sal and Dean did. And just as Dean and Sal were, Christopher McCandless is searching for IT.But what is IT?Christopher McCandless only knows that IT isn't the narrow materialistic individualism of his parents or of people like them. He fervently believes in a ""spiritual"" path which might lead one to IT, but first he must divest himself of crass materialism-- most worldly goods . For, unlike the rich man/camel who cannot pass through the eye of a needle, Christopher McCandless will make it into his heaven because he refuses excess material. He believes in his vow of poverty. So did the Buddah and a thousand Beats and Hippies. He believes that he must make contact with the ""spiritual"" truth by living simply, living like a character out of one of Jack London's adventurous Alaskan adventures. It is a call of the wild which draws him, north, ever north to the Alaska outback. There, he reads Tolstoy's words on how to achieve happiness through simple living and he takes that advice on, living in his own ""Magic Bus""...oh shades of Kesey may your spirit live on.Is it true? Can one find ""spiritual"" fulfillment this way? Perhaps. Especially, if one is inclined to try to find it standing on its head, as the priest in ""The Black Robe"" did in his 17th Century Canadian wilderness trek amongst the native heathen. Religious quests are almost always filled with suffering. Is this not why we were placed on this Earth, like so many chess pieces for the amusement of our Lard.But, in material reality what hath Penn wrought? This is a lad with all the right instincts for freedom, still tied in knots with philosophical Idealism. He's trying to kick out the jams; but he doesn't realize that heading down the path of material deprivation will not get him home--free. As a result of his ""true believer"" mentality, poor Christopher McCandless doesn't recognize his real happiness when it stares him, lovingly in his face. Ah sweet Tracy... He sees the poverty of a future of dead time in the suburbs and he rejects it. Good move, Chris. This rejection makes a lot of the one-dimensional individuals hate him, especially when his disdain is magnified on the silver screen. He sees the wisdom of NOT ""taking more than you can use"" from the Earth, a fact that is brought home hard for him when he shoots a moose, he cannot possibly consume. Hooray for Christopher McCandless there!Christopher McCandless made some discoveries. Like Candide, Sal Paradise, Holden Caufield and the people of his own parents' generation, especially ones who can be seen on in docos like ""Monterey Pop"", he did glimpse IT here and there, only to lose it in the end. For it is in the social relations of friendship and love, all of which he leaves behind in order to live on his own, in a vain attempt to depend only his own, narrow individualism to find ""the truth"".

Compelling,"Angry after having lived a lie for many years a guy leaves his home town and life behind right after graduation. Hitch-hiking across the USA he eventually makes it to Alaska where he lives for some time longer.Based on the life of a real man this film tells a story that is already known by many. I haven't read the book it is based on, so I can't say whether it is a good adaptation or not. The events depicted are clear enough though. On his way through life the main person is changed by the people he meets and the things he gets to do - and in many cases he changes whoever he runs in to. And as his tale grows longer his life becomes more complex and he becomes less of the person he was when he left his city.As a film it was for me a combination of TV episodes of Jacques Cousteau, and a lot of elements from The Straight Story. Apart from the fact that this film is a dramatized version of reality it never raises far above the level of a ""good"" film. It is good, but not great. The main reason behind that being the way it distracts at some points from the real center of the film - the guy that makes the trip. I can't put a more solid finger on it, but at some points it just shies away from the main subject too much.8 out of 10 miles hiked",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Biography"
Wild Thing! You pull my heartstrings!,"""Into The Wild"" is not based on the astonishing true story of wild choral-child Britney Spears nocturnal escapades in The Bipolar Express. ""Into The Wild"" is not even based on the ""asstonishing"" true story of wild Governor-manchild Eliot Spitzer's nocturnal escapades in The Emperor's Club. ""Into The Wild"" is really based on the astonishing true story of wild child Christopher McCandless who abandoned his possessions, gave his entire $24,000 savings to charity, and hitchhiked to Alaska to live in the wilderness. Just like Britney and Spitzer, his ""assets"" get frozen because of his desire to roam free. Director Sean Penn's compelling film pulls into the heartstrings on the quest of ultimate solitary freedom. ""Into The Wild"" is more into the journey that McCandless took within the friendships he experienced on his hitchhiking route to Alaska. That roster included an affectionate middle-age hippy couple, a fast-talking farmer, and a lonesome geriatric widower. McCandless does reach the apex of solitaire euphoria when he encounters an isolated wrecked bus in Alaska which in turn he calls The Magic Bus. Chris becomes The Who of the Magic Bus by living in it until the song stops playing in his life. It is no secret on what happens to Chris so I am not playing spoiler when I say The Magic Bus becomes The Tragic Bus because he dies in it because of a poisonous fruit he ingested. Chris was eventually going to die anyway from lack of nourishment, so I guess Chris picked his poison. His fragile body was so emaciated that a slight ""McCandless in The Wind"" would have tipped him over. Emile Hirsch's courageous performance as McCandless was enthralling enough to be into the best male leading acting efforts of the year. Hirsch lost an enormous amount of weight for the role; I guess he must have eaten many ""Hirschy Bars"" to gain the weight back. Hirsch's roadie entourage were also into the acting: Hal Holbrook broke our hearts by effectively portraying the emotional senior Ron Franz, Vince Vaughn's ""vaughnisms"" talked the talk and walked the walk as farmer Wayne, and Catherine Keener & Brian Dierker's performances as the hippy Rainey & Jan were hip hip hooray! William Hurt & Marcia Gay Harden as the desperate McCandless parents and Jena Malone as the philosophical McCandless also were into their supporting acting. Eric Gautier's gorgeous scenic cinematography was as cold as ice at times but warm at heart at others. Eddie Vedder of Peal Jam jammed it in with a high score by contributing a nicely-tuned thematic musical score for what ""Into The Wild"" entails. However, it was the Pennmanship of Writer-Director Sean Penn that revitalized Christopher McCandless incredible journey into cinematic reality!

Just a note about Holbrook's performance,"I really enjoyed both the book and the film ""Into The Wild."" Chris has turned into a polarizing character - I am confused by both ends of the spectrum. I am most confused by those who hate him. I mean, they really HATE him and why is that? They call him selfish and arrogant and they say he deserved what he got. I am appalled by that sentiment. My first question is: Do you know any kid at 22, 23, 24 who ISN'T selfish and arrogant to some extent? It's called growing up. I just don't have the energy to have such intense hatred about a person I've never met, and whose actions (selfish and arrogant or not) did not effect me in any way.But I digress - what I really want to say is that Hal Holbrook's performance moved me in a very deep way. I have seen the movie twice and both times I wept for long after Holbrook has left the screen. He just absolutely NAILS Ron Franz's affection for Chris, and Franz's loneliness, in such a profound manner. I was recently retelling Chris's story to my parents, and when I got to the part where Ron and Chris part ways I broke into sobs again. Something about it just really touches me, and I think a lot of that has to do with Holbrook's performance. It is a beautiful thing and worth everyone's time.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Biography"
Quest for meaning,"An idealistic, perhaps immature, young man embarks on a journey both logistically, through America and spiritually, within his own soul.The movie chronicles his travels, the people he encounters and friends he makes, while exploring his motivation behind abandoning all. He abandons his family, friends and any people he encounters in which he gets along so well with. People really have an empathy and love for him. Yet he feels the need to abandon all that is good to reach his destination and isolation  Alaska. The movie hints at this motivation, but it remains somewhat unclear to the audience, as it would be to anyone as I'm sure it was to the man himself. Upon speculation some conclusions can be drawn, such as; the need to prove himself and make himself a better man (if he can survive with nothing in the wild he can survive anywhere), soul searching for happiness, perhaps running from something such as family problems (and probably something undocumented and unknown to anyone), the adventure and experience.Critics may claim, with some merit, that this is just a spoiled selfish young man. Why care for someone like this who hurts his family and loved ones for some egotistical meanderings. However aren't faulty characters the truest expression of humanity? Can't we see reflections of this person in others and even ourselves to some degree? The character is clearly seeking out something Grandiose, something bigger than family, friends and human interaction, some all encompassing meaning of life. As opposed to other movies seemingly attempting to satiate our appetites for these grandiose answers but just wets our appetite by feeding us vague tastes at meanings in order to purposely make us ponder, this movie satisfyingly portrays the young man's and story's subjective belief of an answer, leaving the audience fulfilled. The ending is very fulfilling as the young man attains his Wisdom.The scenery is beautiful containing many shots of the most beautiful, alien landscapes I know of in the World, the West. The movie was a little slow and dragged. It was very poignant for better or for worse.I think this young man's quest is something we can all admire and make a part of ourselves in a lesser degree.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Biography"

A Beautiful Poetic Film...,"""There is a pleasure in the pathless woods, There is rapture on the lonely shore, There is society where none intrudes, By the deep sea and the music in its roar; I love not man the less, but nature more."" -Lord ByronAn unforgettable cinematic experience. Yesterday, I caught the last showing of this film... and I am glad I did. Based on a true story of an extraordinary person, it tells the story of Chris McCandless, an exceptionally intelligent person, who's on a journey of his life to avoid the ""system"" He doesn't like how the world works, where people die or get killed and in the world where politicians and parents (Chris' parents were always fighting during his youth) rule. He doesn't want any ""things"" in life: No watch, no car, no money, etc, because he believes things can't buy him happiness it's his want for freedom that does (in his case, nature). That's why he has a motivation to go on a journey, to Alaska. At the end, I think what Chris is trying to accomplish is to find the inner self and live in the most peaceful and purest place on earth, the place where everything is poetic, and the place where nature rules instead of mankind.I praise Sean Penn for a great effort in directing and writing and also Emile Hirsch for a soulful performance that truly captivated my heart. I didn't know he had it in him, a surprising turn and I will be looking forward to his future movies.

"No longer to be poisoned by civilization, he flees, and walks alone upon the land to become lost in the wild.","I've been anticipating this movie ever since laying eyes on the trailer, late November 2007. I'm a bit saddened by the knowledge of how insanely beautiful the nature scenes would have looked in the theater, the DVD experience is never the same at all.Now, let's get to it. 'Into The Wild' stirred up a lot of buzz being a Sean Penn direction and being based on the best selling amazing story of Christopher McCandless. I can't say I've had the pleasure of reading the novel, but a lot of comments deem to conclude Penn has done the book justice.The first thing that's poignant about ITW is the narrative. Penn makes jumps in time and place, giving the story more variation and creating intrigue. It doesn't make it easier to follow, however ITW was never intended for a non-attentive audience. People who can't keep an open mind and identify or at least empathize with characters will not fully enjoy the experience (a word I don't use lightly) that is ITW.Besides the writing, there's lots of other stuff to rave about. The music and the performances come to mind. Eddie Vedder was not the reason I urged to see this, but it was, not a doubt in the world about this, a nice bonus for me. He's the vocalizer of my favorite songs and the perfect voice to guide the audience in this unique road movie. He also adds to the filmmakers' credibility, having strong political opinions ,similar to McCandless',of his own.One glance at the cast should get every pure bred movie lover's heart thumping, William Hurt, Hal Holbrook, Marcia Gay Harden,... Not only did the big names deliver, but the small names almost all surprised me with great to excellent performances. Even down to Brian Dierker, who isn't really an actor! Emile Hirsh, only seen in The Girl Next Door, a film I'm not proud of having seen. His performance in that movie belies his abilities. Even in interviews he comes across as a slick Hollywood run-in-a-mill actor, but his performance really radiates feelings of sincerity and dedication to his work. Another nice surprise was Vince Vaughn, he gives the audience a wonderfully natural performance, easily his best one to this day. Can't forget Catherine Keener, always solid, sometimes excellent. The latter applies for this movie, maybe an Oscar nudge wouldn't have been totally out of place here.ITW is a movie that keeps on giving, as you may have concluded from the size of my review. It's filled with little bonuses. The dialog is not the usual Hollywood pretentious drivel. Some of the philosophies brought forward actually ring true in my ears, something which can't be said about most movies with 'clever' (sarcasm) dialog.One of the nicest things about ITW (I can't believe I didn't mention it already) is the feeling you're watching a lot of different wonderful movies, all wrapped up into one (not overly long) movie. Each segment has their own curious and wonderful characters, but the movie manages never to become chaotic. And that alone is a testament to Sean Penn.About the plot/story: I was happy to know it was biographical beforehand, otherwise some of the events may have seemed to 'out-there', far fetched. And that, I believe, is a testament the real story, the level of amazement it actually offers.As said in an interview by Emile Hirsh himself, the character really is a dividing line audience-wise. Hate him or love him, you have to respect a good film like this one. Extremely Highly recommended, especially for those who loved Eternal Sunshine.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Biography"
"A long, difficult but satisfying and captivating journey","I don't like judging actors and filmmakers by their personality. Tom Cruise may be completely insane and his constant pushing of his Scientology agenda can be excruciating, but that doesn't mean that he isn't a fantastic actor and that I won't watch and enjoy hi s movies. So Sean Penn may be sociopathic, and he may push his political agendas too strong, but he's also one of this generation's most intense and talented actors. I haven't seen The Crossing Guard, but Into the Wild certainly proves that Penn is an almost equally talented filmmaker as well.Surprisingly, Penn employs many unorthodox filming techniques and gimmicks characteristic of the much younger post-modern film-making generation of today. From shaky zooms to really creative use of camera angles and positions to jump- and flash-cuts to text scrawling across the screen. Notice how effectively Penn uses cheap-looking video footage to portray Christopher's brief fantasy sequence involving him reuniting with his parents, or Penn's shocking and very risky use of breaking the fourth wall. It is a kind of wild, loose and visceral style of film-making that is used skillfully to portray that kind of no-strings-attached wilderness that the film portrays in the first place.Penn smartly chooses to employ these elements, as they are exactly what his sprawling, epic, lengthy creation needs for variety and to keep his audience captivated. He certainly provides us with a lot to work with  his film is even divided into chapters, like a novel and less like a short and to-the-point story. The story of Christopher McCandless is one of epic proportions: encompassing two I'd imagine very eventful years, even after selecting a common theme to focus on Penn ends up with a movie scraping at a two-and-a-half hour runtime. But while the crux and initiative of the film is the true story of McCandless' fascinating and unbelievable ascent (or descent?) into spiritual freedom by ridding himself of his money and possessions and eventually launching himself into the wild to live completely off of the land, Penn instead chooses to keep the focus on very particular aspects of Christopher's journey, specifically his relations with other people.Indeed the only chapter depicting Christopher completely alone is the final part of his journey on the ""Magic Bus"" in the Alaskan wilderness, which Penn splices and intercuts with the chronological series of events that unfolds. The rest of the chapters depict Christopher's encounters with various people and characters along his journey, and although the chapters are named aptly emphasizing the change Christopher undergoes with these encounters, the main feeling we get is just how much Christopher leaves his mark on these people, and not the other way around. He helps mend the hippie couple's love life, he finds a new friend in Wayne, and finally he gives both the optimistically young Tracy and the near-the-end old Ron Franz something to hope for. Even Christopher's parents are drawn closer together by his leaving them behind. What's wonderful is that while Christopher's hokey material-free philosophy may seem immature, naïve and perhaps a bit self-destructive, it is in these scenes where he encounters the various characters along the way that we can see his true selflessness, and it is awe-inspiring. The fact that Christopher's epiphany in his dying moments is that ""happiness isn't real unless shared"" just further goes to prove just what a lasting impression these encounters and relationships with various other people are what kept him going.On a more superficial plane, Penn, perhaps employing the immense clout he has around Tinseltown, has assembled an impressive ensemble cast to fill these small supporting roles of the characters Christopher encounters along his journey. From absolutely devastating performances by Oscar winners Marcia Gay Harden and William Hurt as Christopher's worried but suffocating parents to intelligent turns from the likes of Vince Vaughn and Catherine Keener, who plays a surprisingly sweet and happy-go-lucky character similar to the one she portrayed in The 40-Year-Old Virgin and which serves as a total opposite to the kind of manipulative femme fatales she usually plays, like her Oscar-nominated turn in Being John Malkovich. Kristen Stewart plays young, naïve and desperate to its fullest extent, and Hal Holbrook gives the opus performance near the end of the film, providing it with a very important emotional axis. But the centerpiece performance is that of Emile Hirsch; embodying McCandless, he manages to perfectly capture his youthful wonder and perhaps even naivety and delivers a performance of immense power and intensity, including startling and gutsy physical transformations surprising for an actor so young. Indeed it seems like just yesterday that Hirsch was underage and starring in teen comedies like The Girl Next Door: I think it's safe to say that not only is Into the Wild Hirsch's unofficial transition to acting maturity, but also that it proves he is one incredibly talented performer.In all, Into the Wild is a long, difficult but ultimately very satisfying and captivating journey. Penn takes us down a long road and populates it with interesting characters and unique, unorthodox film-making techniques. And it's all accompanied by a great soundtrack including wonderful songs by Eddie Vedder that perfectly capture the spirit of the film. It is a unique film that takes many risks, and it all pays off wonderfully. Penn has more than proved his directorial worth.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Biography"

A very sad romanticized movie of a bad decision maker,"As far as I can see, this movie was and is pandering to people with their heads in the clouds, who will think movie is great, and that Christopher McCandless is some sort of idealized, wilderness casualty. Christopher was a bad planner, a bad organizer, a bad hunter, and a really bad navigator. I almost believe he had a suicide mission, (which later I believe he changed his mind about, but it simply was too late, and he knew this fact with desperation), doing this trip without any of the things he needed. Christopher was educated, smart, so there is no excuse for his actions concerning this venture of his into the wilderness. Delirious starvation, led to not finding a river crossing. Bad circumstances made food in cabins nearby not edible. One of his last entries in his diary made it clear he was afraid to die, to die alone, and that he was desperate to live, but hopeless at the same time. He should have had a compass in his travels, but he did not have one at the time of his death in his possession, which does puzzle me. People will always go where angels fear to tread. One can only hope other people won't make bad decisions to go on trips unprepared, but some people always will, so one can only hope the best for those people, and hope no one follows their footsteps to their death also.",2.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Biography"
"Wonderful. A journey of discovery and escape, it proves that happiness is best when shared.","I must say that ""Into the Wild"" is a great movie one of the most touching and inspirational films in a long time that will touch your heart and emotions. The film is done in such a beautiful manner for the way it shows how journey and nature spellbinds and becomes amazingly personal to a young man in search of escape and discovery of happiness. ""Into the Wild"" is inspired by a true story and the screenplay and directing both was brilliantly done by acting veteran Sean Penn, though it may seem long and drawn out to some the film moves at a pace that travels you along for the right amount of time for each adventure and discovery and the meetings of new people that this young man encounters.Set in 1990 after graduation from college straight A student Chris McCandless(Emile Hirsch)decides finally he must abandon his life of spoiled privilege and comfort from his wealthy and sheltered parents Billie(Marcia Gay Harden)and Walt(William Hurt)by making a cross country journey to discover freedom of life on the road that's full of adventures, rejecting reason, and meeting new people and most of all having new joys and being happy. All along the main goal of Chris is to reach and settle down in the Alaskan wilderness. Along the way this film is told stirring and steady by the use of flashbacks and told by the narration of his sister Carine. Along the way the fun and enjoyment of natures beauty which was inspired to Chris by reading the works of Jack London fails in comparison to his meeting of new people and friends. Catherine Keener gives a good turn as a likable hippie and biker type gal Jan, and Vince Vaughn is a treat as Wayne the hard working common man farmer in South Dakota. Last but not least the most important encounter for Chris is in the California dessert community when he encounters wisdom and learns faith from an old man Ron Franz(Hal Holbrook is terrific here). Proving most of all that life is about new people, discoveries and learning to be happy and feeling good about sharing.When the journey finally ends and he deceases in the Alaskan wilderness in August of 1992 this young man had seen the light of life and learned faith and wisdom while he rejected phony reasons and the hidden lies of his family life. Overall ""Into the Wild"" is a very touching and moving film a great viewing to uplift your spirits and have you feeling the need for your own personal journey to discover new people and to find happiness. The pacing and direction of the film is top notch from Penn while the scenes of Hirsch and Holbrook together are touching and wonderfully emotional.

A deeply affecting movie about life's journeys,"Firstly I note that in this year of 2021 Hal Holbrook (Mr Franz) passed away at the age of 95. He was 82 while filming Into The Wild, and became the oldest male performer ever nominated for an Academy Award for his very touching role in the movie. Whilst the movie seems so much about Christopher McCandless who is in almost every scene, I sense this movie is as much about the other people we encounter along the way. Sean Penn does a fine job of showing that these people are also on their journeys, as indeed we the viewers are too. I have to give a ten as I believe it achieves everything it could have done.

we are not alone,"Like most readers of the Krakauer book, the news that a Hollywood production of this tale was in the offing made me feel something akin to dread. The book describes a troubled young man, perhaps a genius, who perversely has a life-changing effect on practically everyone he meets, but may have been, at heart, a misanthrope. Krakauer makes sure his reader is aware that, despite his meticulous research, we are dealing with educated guesswork. The plot synopsis on IMDb states: ""Along the way, Christopher encounters a series of characters that shape his life."" This is simply wrong. The fact is these people were shaped by Chris, but failed to influence him in any fundamental way that would divert him from his ill-fated course. Why Chris did what he did is ultimately unknowable.Sean Penn's triumph is to preserve that ethos. Yes, it is beautifully shot, has a wonderful soundtrack, and a host of character actors step up to the plate and give outstanding service. From the book, Ron Franz stays in the mind most, a man sleepwalking through life till he encountered Chris, whom he wished to adopt. That character takes a while to surface in the film, but when he does, Hal Holbrook inhabits him completely. As Chris's father, William Hurt shows just as he did in History of Violence that range and economy are his forte these days. We admire Chris for the strength of his convictions, the vitality he radiates, but there is always the urge to condemn, or at least finger-wag. He has the self-obsession of the true artist, and the hurt that creates in those around him is very real. Penn makes the brave decision to put this at the heart of his film, by having Chris's sister narrate his tale.Imagine, if you will, that this young man had not died, but had been found by hunters alive but enfeebled, then nursed back to health. The tale of a young man who went to live in the wilds of Alaska but ended up poisoning himself would have been tabloid fodder. Chris McCandless would have been a figure of ridicule and public scorn. But he did die, and that is the price tragic heroes pay for their status. Still, like most people, I would much rather he were alive, to enlighten us on what he learned from his adventure.It is a rare pleasure to have a film live up to a book. Penn's portrayal complements rather than mimics; I felt I got different things from the film, rather than merely re-visiting the book's pleasures. Comparisons with Grizzly Man are inevitable but in a good sense, both films focusing on the triumph of the human spirit in dark circumstances.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Biography"

Poignant story told with love of the adventure,"Every few years, I find myself watching this film again. It always moves me. Penn has a real ability to build Chris' journey as a cinematic poem to help us understand the draw of the wild -- which is nothing new, thus great books about it far into the past. It's where we are all from, after all; that beautiful bond with the oneness of God's wilderness where we can reconnect to the truth of who we are. Chris was not alone in feeling that connection even more strongly than someone with a happy, trouble-free life. The call of the wild is eons old and sometimes ends in tragedy, though not always. Despite not being allowed to sit next to a stranger in a restaurant in 2020, we are still allowed to climb El Capitan in Yosemite by the thousands each year, or sky dive off Half Dome, kayak into rapids of Big Drops... I mean, just driving a car is one of the most deadly things we do every day but no one tells us that we are romanticizing death by participating. So to see anyone outline this film as making Chris some hero tells me they didn't really understand the film. We need not know the family dynamics to simply learn about this lifestyle, often embarked upon by young men. Krakauer, the author of the book that captured Penn's imagination, has lamented that he was the catalyst for hundreds of people to injure themselves, lose their lives, and desecrate the iconic bus that sheltered Chris. But in my estimation, what he did was honor Chris' memory and try to tell his story. In many ways, it is the story of how those of higher intelligence don't -- can't -- necessarily perceive life in the limited way that the mediocre majority do. Anyone who sees this film as being about a selfish arrogant young man is actually the one being selfish, trying to force Chris to be something they expect him to be. Oh, the irony. Oh, the utter lack of compassion they claim was his but which they own themselves. I can't say enough about how this film moved me and I would like to believe that those responsible for telling the story feel honored, all in all.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Biography"

"A portrait of the many forms of happiness we seek to achieve. Here it is shown how the concept of home, family and fulfillment can be interpreted in many different ways","In June 1990, Christopher Johnson McCandless graduated with honors from Emory University in Atlanta. Coming from a wealthy Washington family, an excellent student, a great athlete, with extensive experience in hiking and expeditions in inhospitable terrain, Chris had a promising future ahead of him. Except for the fact that, that same month, he decided to donate all the money in his savings (a total of $24,000), destroy his documents, burn the money he had in his wallet and disappear. A little over two years later, his decomposed body was found by a group of moose hunters in Alaska.Shortly after this event, writer and journalist Jon Krakauer (author of ""In Thin Air"") was given the task of writing a report on Chris and all the enigma that surrounded his story. With the data he was able to collect from what was found next to the young man's body (diaries, books with several underlined excerpts and photographic films), he wrote a 9,000-word article that was published in January 1993 in Outside Magazine. However, even after the publication of his article, Krakauer remained deeply involved in the story of Chris McCandless. Who was he? Why did he decide to drop everything and go adventuring across the country? So Krakauer spent more than a year tracing the young man's path, talking to the people who knew him, trying to understand his motivations. This whole experience resulted in a book called ""In Wild Nature"".Written and directed by Sean Penn, it's clear that despite being based on someone else's work, this is a very personal work. The way in which each aspect of life is digressed and contemplated is done without haste, taking advantage of every moment. Aided by non-linear editing and a wonderfully natural use of its native imagery, ""In the Wild"" is virtually formless, and seeks to tell its story while also elevating it. There is sometimes a very strong sense of depression, which is easily overthrown by funny moments and which more than anything seek to make sense of Chris McCandless's journey.The script can get confusing with the constant changes in timelines, but the character study is its main point, and combined with the excellent performance of Emile Hirsch, who, in addition to being extremely similar to McCandless, has the right look for this type of story. . His unkempt appearance and body language matched the story so well that we felt like seeing his story in documentary form. Concepts of family are subtly and powerfully crafted, with McCandless's interactions with others during his trip enriching the spiritual experience.The intrinsic part of the work is in human relationships, which Christopher only understands and admires when he finally allows himself to experience them in their completeness. The protagonist's troubled childhood and adolescence, in the midst of a completely bankrupt family organization, guided by a dysfunctional couple, did not allow the young man to become very attached to his parents. The presence of Jan Burres (Catherine Keener) and Rainey (Brian H. Dierker), therefore, becomes essential for the presumed deconstruction of the young man's thinking, disgusted with man, but content with nature. The two appear on the scene as vague father figures, who, unlike the boy, follow life by venturing out on the roads, not through nature itself. The actors, doing well in their respective roles, fully convince in terms of performance, especially Catherine, embodying a mother full of frustration, grief inherent in human beings. Hal Holbrook, interpreter of Ron Franz, presents himself as the true apex of interpretation of the feature film, giving credit to a retired man with a tragic past, who sees in Christopher the possibility of finally having someone to share his experience with. , someone to call grandson. The relationship between the two is very beautiful, touching, about mutual learning.Minor interpretations are also effective. Kristen Stewart, for example, decently works the role given to her, the character, even more inexperienced than the protagonist, Tracy Tatro. The most important thing about this figure, however, contrary to a more individual look, is presented in the innocence of how Supertramp sees the girl, causing even greater influences in the construction of the feeling of empathy between the spectator and the protagonist, observed in a unique and graceful, almost pure. The nature ventured by the boy, parallel to this, is also filled with meaning. Emile Hirsch's sentimental look at a simple deer, full of layers - reiterating a previous point - attributes to the journey an exciting approximation, of the moment, to what the naivest would call happiness. If the relationships that the character puts into motion during his grandiose path - Wayne Westerberg (Vince Vaughn) also stands out - already overcome a more ""egoistic"" - youthful - view of the young man's adventure, leaving his parents behind on the way, the trail sound, surprisingly, still enhances it. Pearl Jam's Eddie Vedder's compositions perfectly match the spirit of the narrative, about the intangibility of a world. The musical verbiage, for some, can also be interpreted as an exceptional complement to the boy's adventure - a charming resumption.Without trying to convince himself that he has some kind of grand ""mission"" (like protecting bears or Alaska), McCandless is - though he won't admit it - simply running from his past - and his unstated (unconscious, incidentally) purpose is to find some way to fill the inner void left by the troubled relationship with the parents. And, unlike Herzog's ""Bear Man"", the boy does not reveal an unconscious desire to commit suicide; seeking danger was not his intention, although his lack of preparation to deal with the circumstances he found himself in reveals a tragic and fatal immaturity. In seeking a frugal existence that perhaps completed him as a human being, McCandless mostly discovered the ruthless side of Nature that he believed to be benevolent - and it is a sad irony that, in the end, he sought fragile shelter in precisely the symbol of urban life: a bus.Never facing Christopher in a romanticized way (one of the countless virtues of this Into the Wild), Penn's script does not hesitate to illustrate the cruelest and most selfish facets of the boy: although his parents were far from representing an example of good creation, it is undeniable that McCandless's reaction is as or crueler than the mistakes made by relatives - and leaving them without hearing from you for years is something that, as a parent, I consider absolutely unforgivable. Furthermore, although he considers himself superior to his father's materialism, the young man demonstrates his own futility by burning the money he has, giving more importance to the symbolism of his gesture (relevant only to himself) than to the practical considerations that that amount could represent immense help to needy individuals.On the other hand, McCandless has an unquestionably kind nature - and his interest in listening to what others have to say is admirable. Regrettably, his immeasurable rancor for his own past (which sounds like a petty-bourgeois crisis in the face of the real and gigantic problems faced by so many other people) ends up making him blind to what is good in his life, transforming him into a young man who he takes everything too seriously and contrasts him, for example, with the amusing rogue played in a charismatic way by Vince Vaughn. Striving never to put down roots anywhere (he demonstrates a real aversion to the concept of ""home""), Christopher ends up going against his own nature, since, although he shows curiosity for what his friends say (as mentioned above), he ignores he systematically follows the advice he receives, choosing instead to believe his own immature discourse about the ""evils of Society"".Shot entirely on location across the United States, Sean Penn and cinematographer Eric Gautier invest in authenticity by filming at real points in the protagonist's journey, including the bus that sheltered him in an almost surreal way on his last stop. With that, ""Into the Wild"" takes on a documentary character and may end up looking much deeper and more painful than it actually is. Make no mistake, this is a film that is easy to digest, pleasant to the senses and that will teach you a few things about life. What makes the whole experience even more rewarding is simply having the curiosity to know what will happen around the next corner. It's like you're venturing out yourself. After all, who hasn't wanted to embark on a journey into the unknown?Sean Penn's production is a portrait of the many forms of happiness we seek to achieve. Here it is shown how the concept of home, family and fulfillment can be interpreted in many different ways and that to be really happy we only need one thing; find ourselves in this gigantic world. McCandless becoming a hero after having ""failed"" in his mission to survive in Alaska, and today being a symbol for many people who criticize the way we choose to live in our society, is an example that this story could only grow with time. As a film it's very good, as a reason to look at your life and try to live it the best way possible, it's exceptional. The work fits perfectly in Penn's filmography, which, as a director, seems to specialize in sad and hopeless stories that seek to investigate human nature through its most distressing (see the wonderful The Promise). Even so, there is, here, a touch of optimism that does not exist in his previous works, since Christopher McCandless, although initially preaching that happiness cannot be found in human relationships, demonstrates that he understands, after all, that this much desired state of mind is only real when shared.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Biography"
A terrific and poignant character study,"This is a well-written tale which is a poignant and moving character study. It may not appeal to all fans of the survival genre but it is still an amazing movie which is an emotional ride.Graduated student Christopher McCandless donates all of his money to charity and begins to set out to live in the Alaskan wild. Along the way, he meets a series of people who change his life.Its story is very deep. It's a story of following a path that you choose for yourself. I always like it when movie's have deep plots which make you think. Christopher says that he feels career's are a 20th-century invention and he wants no part of that and I sort of agree with him. Its story is really important because it revolves around and talks about the opinion that many people have.The acting is great from Emile Hirsch. Many of the other actors give superb roles as well. There weren't any actors who gave performances I had an issue with.I don't think it's flawless though. There were very few scenes of survival in this film. I likely would've enjoyed the movie more had it consisted of something like 50% survival scenes and 50% flashbacks. However, what we got instead was about 85%-90% flashbacks. Also, the film dragged a little.Also, on a side note, I recommend you don't read the critic reviews because many of them contain spoilers. I usually trust the critics, but in this case, I'd say ignore them and read them after you watch the movie.So in conclusion, this is a great character study which contains great lessons and it may affect you greatly depending on what you believe. It could've been better, but it's still a good film.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Biography"

Why wasn't this movie nominated for Best Picture?,"I just watched this film on DVD after having read the book about 6 years ago. I found it to be an excellent film adaptation of an original story.The acting is excellent. Emile Hirsch gives one of those ""career defining"" performances. The rest of the cast was quite good. Hal Holbrook has a small but very touching part. What impressed me about the film overall is the excellent story telling. Sean Penn found a way to make the story compelling by using different voices to narrate the story. My major question is ""Why was this not nominated for Best Picture?"". I would say it is a better film than Michael Clayton or No Country. I wonder if it was hurt by the way it challenges contemporary social and cultural values? Of course one could just resort to saying that Chris was ""crazy"" but that doesn't really address the fact that he tried to live a life based on complete integrity without compromise.

You'll find yourself in this film...,"Re-Watched 'Into the Wild' today. I last saw it upon its release back in 2007 when I was finishing my masters and stuck in a job I pretended to like, and a persona I pretended to be. I saw it with an old friend, whom due to my fault, I lost contact with many years ago. But to get back to this film, the gravity of this personal story and its truthful nature to the person it was based on goes to the very essence of humanity and how powerful our need is to find ourselves within each other, even when we do our best to escape one-another. Particularly at this moment in time, when we are asked to be apart from one-another, the truth is we can dive in to the deepest voids or climb up to the highest peaks, but at the end of every sunset and beginning of ever sunrise, true happiness is our ability to share our experiences with one another in person. Whilst social media provides us with an instant means to share our experiences and virtually connect with each other, for many of us it is a convenient illusion of choice, which the character in this film ironically did not face in 1992, when he made his fateful journey into the wild. Like the character in 'The Alchemist', he ventures to find his personal treasure, and on the way he learns truths that compliment and challenge his ideals. A story I have come across so often in fiction and reality that this film captures so well in a person who dared to live it. If you haven't seen this film, I heartily recommend you do, it reaffirms ones faith in humanity, in being present, in forgiveness...",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Biography"
Fantastic Movie,"Based on the nonfiction book by Jon Krakauer, this movie is one that is well worth a watch. It follows a young man named Chris McCandless through the two years between his college graduation and his death in 1992. Through these two years, he donates all of his money, travels America, and impacts the lives of everyone he meets before ending up in Alaska.Released in 2007, it stars Emile Hirsch, Vince Vaughn, Jena Malone, and Kristen Stewart with a budget of around $15 million. It only pulled in a little over $56 million at the box office and runs for a total of 2 hours and 26 minutes.I would give this film a 9 out of 10 just because of its amount of information regarding Chris' life in such a short time.The style of the film feels very unique, even though it has been used in many other films. The cinematography involved really helped capture the beauty of the scene locations and was astonishing throughout the entire film. The movie's got a lot of time to cover and so the use of jumping back and forth from Chris' bus days to his trip to Alaska can be confusing to some people. The editing and writing of the script really helped clear this confusion up. As for the characters, they aren't always around for a long time in Chris' life, but they all impact him and he impacts them, making them vital and somewhat relatable. The last half hour or so was both amazing and extremely sad. Since it's based on a true story, the ending is predictable, but it's hard to prepare yourself for it anyway.Into The Wild is a movie that makes you think and feel. It explores the idea of happiness and life itself. The characters and their connections delve into society and the way that people connect. Friendships and family are shone in a new light. Very few movies are capable of pulling this off successfully, but this movie did it and succeeded.It really is wonderful.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Biography"
Loved the movie for a few great lessons of life it presented to us !!,"I really liked the movie, not for the way the protagonist (Chris McCandless) lived his life but for the great lessons presented to us during the course of the movie. There might be different ways for different people to live their lives but movie showed what everyone should be looking for in their lives. I would like to mention a few lessons which I personally liked in the movie:1. Set yourself free to explore what the soul inside us wants to and not just succumb to a life of security.When Chirs McCandless says: "".. so many people live within unhappy circumstances and yet will not take the initiative to change their situation because they are conditioned to a life of security, conformity, and conservatism, all of which may appear to give one peace of mind, but in reality nothing is more dangerous to the adventurous spirit within a man than a secure future. The very basic core of a man's living spirit is his passion for adventure. The joy of life comes from our encounters with new experiences, and hence there is no greater joy than to have an endlessly changing horizon, for each day to have a new and different sun.""Taken from song Society by Eddie Vedder from the movie: ""It's a mystery to me .. We have a greed with which we have agreed And you think you have to want more than you need Until you have it all you won't be free.""2. Never let your mistakes be a reason to be not able to do better in future. Instead we should use the learning from the mistakes to do much better.Taken from Song Rise by Eddie Vedder: ""Gonna rise up Turning mistakes into gold""As for the way Chris McCandless lived his life, I just have to say this was the way he wanted to live. A different person might have done different things in the same situation but the heart of the movie lied in its teachings which I can sum up as ""One should learn, struggle, pursue his dreams during his life and do whatever it takes to find and fulfill the purpose of his life.""",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Biography"

Can any movie on any story get any better than this?,"With more than 500 reviews to its credit I doubt that anyone will get to read mine. Not to write this review based on this perception, however, is to let down the person that inspired this story and to confess that I failed this movie. This has got to be the greatest story put into a movie I have ever watched. This could have been my own story if I have not chosen to run and delve into academia to escape the very things that drove Chris away from the university and civilization and into the wild. In the end it isn't what I didn't achieve in academic distinction in medicine in spite of my modest success but what I missed in not towing Chris's path that haunts me after watching this movie.Each one of us would react differently to the movie but this powerful story will grip us and make us reassess our own values. Watching the camera zoom out in the final scene, we are caught searching our own souls and asking ourselves if we have the courage to do what this young man did with his life.I gave this movie a perfect score of 10/10 not because of its stunning cinematography, sound, editing, the labour and the insight that motivated and went into making the movie and especially the great outdoor shots, but because it captured a story so effortlessly and passively you would imagine that the story just told itself without a script, a film crew and a director.

Quite Boring tbh,"""Into the Wild"" (2007) disappoints with its bland storytelling, shallow characters, and uninspired cinematography. The nonlinear narrative feels disjointed, failing to immerse viewers in Christopher McCandless's journey. Lacking depth, the film struggles to explore its themes of freedom and self-discovery effectively. Despite the promising premise, the Alaskan wilderness fails to captivate, with lackluster visuals. Character development is minimal, leaving audiences disconnected from McCandless's motivations. The film's ambiguous ending further underscores its lack of direction and coherence.

Emile Hirsch, the supporting actors (especially the father because of his character's development in the movie) and Eddie Vedder's music are just wonderful elements in a film that has a more natural and interesting flow than most Hollywood productions and really touches on something important!

"Amazing movie, surprisingly just as good as the book.","Into the Wild is one of the greatest films I have seen. The beautiful scenery, accurate details, excellent acting, combined with Eddie Vedder's contributions to the soundtrack only added to the powerful message of the movie.The best part of the movie was how closely it paralleled the book. Krakauer's novel was so powerful and beautifully written, one would expect a movie based on the same story to fall short of it's written counterpart. Sean Penn failed to disappoint, and Emile Hirsch only contributed to the portrayal of Chris due to the fact that the two could be related they look so similar. One of my favorite parts of the movie was the scene in which Chris is having a conversation with Ron Franz and declares a valuable message: that ""You are wrong if you think that the joy of life comes principally from the joy of human relationships. God's place is all around us, it is in everything and in anything we can experience. People just need to change the way they look at things."" This message was just as powerful in the book, and in this scene the brilliance of Sean Penn shone through. The relationships Chris built in the movie were wonderful in the fact that he seemed to distance himself from everyone, yet at the same time had an intense personal bond with people that were fundamentally strangers. My favorite encounter Chris had was meeting Ron Franz, and the lessons the two taught each other were beautiful and inspiring.There are very, very few things I disliked about the film. One of the fundamentals of the book was the fact that seclusion such as the isolation Chris found in Alaska ultimately led to an examination of one's own soul, rather than a simple minded hatred of society. The book compares Chris to a modern Thoreau, whose journey into the wild led to not only a closeness to nature at its fullest, but a closeness to oneself and an examination of the soul. This did not come across clearly in the film, the focus was more on the adventure Chris found along the way. Although this was not a huge mistake to make, it would have been nice to see more of Chris' journals and personal ideals displayed at some point during the movie.Though it is difficult to compare Into the Wild to another film, the strong personal ideals and adoration of the wilderness vaguely reminded me of The River Wild. Though the plots of these movies are completely different, the grandeur of the wilderness is reflected in both. Into the Wild shows a man discovering himself, while The River Wild portrays the bonds of family and the discovery of another not being who they seem, which is ultimately what Chris found to be the major flaw of today's society.Into the Wild is a movie full of joy, adventure, sadness, beauty, nature, devastation, intense happiness, and unforgettable wisdom.

A good and of course also original movie.,"To be frank, I always thought that I would hate this movie, based on it that it featured a stupid concept in my opinion and because it got directed by Sean Penn, who I thought would turn this movie into something incredibly pretentious and dead serious. But of course as it turned it, it wasn't all that bad. It's a quite good movie, that still doesn't really speak to me but still remains an interesting watch.The movie becomes interesting to watch due to the its main character. You get why he does things and sees things the way he does. You understand his motivations, whether you agree with them or not. So that makes the movie interesting to watch and all but just not a very compelling one either. At least not for me. I recognize that that's probably just my personal taste and most other people might still be grabbed by its story and all of its emotions.It sounds strange but I probably would had exactly liked this movie more, if it was done a bit more pretentious. Some more artistic shots, some deeper meanings to some of its themes and characters. I at times missed that in this movie and feel that Sean Penn made a bit of a too mainstream movie.Not that the movie is not original to watch though. It of course gets made interesting with its unusual story, that got based on true events, which also always makes a movie more interesting to watch, in my opinion.Thing i didn't always liked about its story and storytelling were its many different character, that kept popping up for just a couple of minutes, before they disappeared completely out of the movie again. I get it that this was supposed to add to the sense of adventure and the feeling that the main characters was constantly on the move but it doesn't always work out too well, since the point of some of its characters just isn't always clear enough. It at times almost feels redundant and slows the movie down, also making this quite a long watch.And just because he is Sean Penn, he got a bunch of good and big name actors to show up in this movie, which worked out positively, since everybody fitted their roles quite well. It of course mostly gets carried by Emile Hirsch but some of its supporting cast members also manage to impress, such as William Hurt and Hal Holbrook for instance.So really, it's a good and interesting movie to watch, even though the story still doesn't really speak out to me personally.7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Biography"

"Solid film, but fell short of my expectations","Into the Wild is a road-trip/biography film based on a true story about an adventurer named Christopher McCandless. After college graduation, he decides to give away all his possessions and hide from society. He adopts the name Alex Supertramp and travels across the United States, making money from small jobs. At the same time, he finds time to experience the beauty of nature. Eventually, he decides to journey into the Alaskan wilderness alone.Emile Hirsch does a good job acting as Alex. Although I can't say I was entirely impressed his performance, I respect him because of the difficulty of the role. The fact that he was believable was one of the main things that made the film work.The plot is somewhat convoluted, alternating between his adventure in Alaska and his previous experiences around continental United States. For much of the film, I did not feel like I was connecting with the events or emotions that Alex was experiencing. The pacing was rather slow as well. There were some things, such as the problems with Alex's parents, that were unclear. Toward the end, it did get better. The final scene was simply beautiful. Despite this, its difficult not to label the film as overlong.Into the Wild holds high standards in direction and editing. The environmental scenes are a clear contrast to the bland city or slum segments. They are beautifully shot and panned. There are some neat effects, such as slow motion or stylistic blurring, that add a nice touch.The film fell short of the expectations that I built up from significant critical praise.

An Oscar snub and an inspiring American film,"""Into the Wild"" is one of the best films I have ever seen that is 95% without addressing any kind of human sin or vice. Almost no one wrongs anyone or indulges in anything of moral consequence: this is a film about man vs. self and of course man vs. nature. It is a coming- of-age story and then some; it is an adventure that explores the American countryside as well as the human soul. Sean Penn has rarely written or taken the director's chair in his career and it's clear to see why he took a seat with this project: it's a truly inspiring film.""Into the Wild"" is based on a Jon Krakauer book that catalogues the true story of Chris McCandless (Emile Hirsch), who after graduating Emory decides to rid himself of his family and all of his worldly possessions, call himself Alexander Supertramp, and travel the country with hopes of living out in Alaska. The film takes a narrative and literary structure that redefines the phrase ""adapted from a novel."" There are actual chapters and the scenes really do feel like chapters the way they are split by very verbose narrative from Chris' sister Carine (Jena Malone). It's a terrific style that Penn has created and rather essential for understanding the film's ideas.McCandless' story is an empowering one: It would seem hard to screw up. The trick, however, is keeping it interesting (especially at almost 2.5 hours long). The way that Penn has it jump from McCandless when he finally is in Alaska to the story of how he gets there helps that along. Penn also uses some really cool techniques and though-provoking shots that carry deeper meaning in addition to being stylistically pleasing. While ""Wild"" does drag at times, the great ensemble cast helps it change pace. The only regret I have with the film is that despite how long it is, the supporting characters don't get enough time to develop. That and the overall tempo are the only things keeping this from a 10/10 in my eyes.Hirsch does a very good job of capturing the free spirit of McCandless and getting across the values and reasoning for why he did what he did. It's more so Penn's script that slowly kind of reveals this logic, but Hirsch will definitely have a terrific career doing dramas, no question. Supporting actors Catherine Keener, Vince Vaughn and Hal Holbrook are also very good (Holbrook's last scene is one of the more touching moments in the film) though it would have been nicer to have seen more of them.Though that's sort of the point of the film in a way. McCandless abandons everything for the sake of living free and dissolving himself of the fabrications of society (particularly money). He is completely driven in this regard that it makes him ignorant of the way he touched the lives of those he met and most importantly, how they truly meant something to him.This is a film that will make you take a long hard look at the way you live and will likely unearth a deeper appreciation of life's simplest gifts that get lost in the hustle and bustle of society and its fascination with material possession. The only person who wouldn't get that from this film is one who has a profound hate for Emerson and Thoreau. This is just a great movie and best of all, it is one that is incredibly positive: now that's a Hollywood rarity.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Biography"

My Absolute Favourite Movie of All Time!,"The movie is incredible. It's touching and delves into the simplicity of life, getting rid of the seemingly required redundancies of money, work, etc. I feel so close to the character, wishing I grew up in a simpler time where homes were made out of logs and there was no electricity or many of the hardships that come with modern day life. This is the most moving film I have ever watched, i found it in a time in my life where I really needed something inspirational like this, which made it just that much sweeter.Hope you enjoy it as much as I truly did. This is truly my all time favourite movie, I wouldn't call another movie my favourite, at least not until one tops this. x",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Biography"
One of my favourites,"Into the Wild,"" directed by Sean Penn, is a beautifully crafted film that invites viewers into the heart and mind of Christopher McCandless, played by Emile Hirsch. Based on Jon Krakauer's non-fiction book, the movie tells the true story of a young man who, after graduating from Emory University, decides to leave behind his comfortable life and venture into the wilderness in search of deeper meaning.From the very beginning, we see Christopher as a passionate idealist who is disillusioned by the materialism and expectations of society. He donates his savings to charity, changes his name to ""Alexander Supertramp,"" and sets off on an adventure across America. His journey is not just about escaping; it's about discovering who he truly is. Hirsch's performance captures both the youthful exuberance and the underlying pain of a man grappling with his identity and family issues.As Christopher travels, he meets a variety of characters who enrich his experience and challenge his worldview. From a couple of free-spirited hippies to an elderly man longing for companionship, each encounter adds layers to his understanding of life and relationships. These moments are beautifully portrayed, reminding us that our connections with others are what truly matter.Visually, ""Into the Wild"" is stunning. The cinematography showcases the breathtaking landscapes of America, from sun-drenched deserts to lush forests. The beauty of nature is almost a character in itself, reflecting Christopher's longing for freedom and adventure. Eddie Vedder's haunting score perfectly complements the visuals, evoking a sense of both wonder and melancholy that lingers throughout the film.However, as Christopher reaches the infamous ""Magic Bus"" in Alaska, the reality of his dream begins to shift. Initially reveling in solitude and simplicity, he soon faces harsh truths about survival in the wild. The film doesn't shy away from showing the struggles he encounters-his mistakes in foraging for food ultimately lead to tragic consequences. This part of the story serves as a stark reminder that while nature can be beautiful, it can also be unforgiving.What makes ""Into the Wild"" so impactful is its exploration of happiness and connection. As Christopher grapples with isolation, he realizes that true fulfillment comes not just from adventure but from sharing experiences with others. His longing to return home becomes palpable as he confronts his limitations and the reality of his choices.Critics have praised ""Into the Wild"" for its heartfelt storytelling and Hirsch's compelling portrayal of McCandless. The film encourages us to reflect on our own lives-what we value, what we seek, and how we connect with those around us. It's both an inspiring tale of self-discovery and a cautionary reminder about the fragility of life.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Biography"
What a emotional film,This is my one of favorite movie this movie inspired me soooo much,10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Biography"
"When you want something in life, you just gotta reach out and grab it.","Where should I begin? I could begin by praising Emile Hirsch (and the rest of the amazing cast). I could praise how beautiful the film was. I could praise Sean Penns direction. Instead let's start somewhere else.Let's start of by saying I stood ready with the hacksaw one hour into the film, the lack of character development, lack of depth and story development. The thing that stuck out was the fact that I felt NOTHING for any of the characters, I just couldn't relate to anyone. I didn't understand until the end why it had to be told that way, not skipping anything not jumping straight to the point. When the film changes gear and ups the ante. That's where the real story starts and it's during this one and half hour you truly get to know the characters and start to FEEL.I admire Christopher McCandless for the journey he made, I envy him for his radical unlimited mind. In a world were money, capitalism and consumption is becoming an issue he set out to free himself from his parents and the world, live free from everyone and everything.Christopher McCandless set out in the world trying to find himself and freedom - he made it.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Biography"
Selfish freeloader,"How can somebody so educated be so stupid? I read the book and watched the movie. I'm still repulsed by such self indulgence, selfishness and willful ignorance. If he had a purpose in life he could've done so much; he could've brought joy to people rather than grief. No gratitude. He's a hypocrite. He gives all his money to charity and then he mooches his way up to Alaska depending on the charity of others. He can't put this on his dysfunctional family. People have survived far far worse.It seems he was a accolite of Henry David Thoreau. Thoreau was also a deadbeat living off the land of others. Thoreau Quote: Most people live lives of quiet desperation. I think that was projection on Thoreau's partNice soundtrack. Well produced and directed, even well written; it's just the subject matter that's a turn off.",3.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Biography"
Spiritual Experience,"There is a very specific reason , I am here writing a review, which I generally don't even with the movies I adore.I came across a lot of negative reviews in the user review column, and surprisingly each one of those people didn't hate the movie, but the character of Chris MCandless (May his soul R.I.P) and the personal decisions he took in his life.Every one has his/her own opinion on a movie, but I just couldn't help taking up this point to every on who thought that Chris MCandless was a stupid guy, and so the movie sucks.Its like seeing ""Downfall (2004)"" and saying I didn't like what Hitler did, and so the movie is bad.I pity those single star rating (6% rating 5 and below, which I think is totally in-appropriate for such a beautiful movie) which have dragged down it rating considerably.One of the best I have seen in years.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Biography"

GUIDE TO FIND HAPPINESS.,"If you are happy then it is ok but if not then find the happiness because you deserve it. Forget about the society and the people and do what you want to do and this is what the film tell's us. I believe that there is no embarrassment in not having good cloths, bikes, cars, shoes, phones and money because this is the illusion of modernity if don't want it forget about it. Life is one our life's dream is one so don't go for another option take graduation and live your happiness in the things you have or you want.

Crossing the river,"Something arising from this film which readers may be able to answer.It's well documented how Chris was totally unprepared for this trip and when he tried to find his way back to civilisation towards the end of July, the river was in full flow and couldn't be crossed. However, he was criticised also for not having a map with him, when, had he been in possession of one, he could have discovered there was a river crossing less than a mile away.However, I've been reading about the hundreds of attempts by hikers to reach the McCandless bus since 1992 and how many of them have failed to cross the river; indeed, there have been some fatalities attempting to do so.My question is, the ""modern day"" explorers would surely have done their homework and know about the existence of the bridge a short way up the river. In the articles I have been reading over the last couple of days, why haven't people attempted to use it to cross safely? Is it no longer there?",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Biography"
Questioning Existence,"Sometimes you put a disc in the player and you're unsure as to whether or not you are going to enjoy the film coming up, despite numerous fantastic reviews. Into The Wild was one of those for me.I needn't have worried. Within 10 minutes, I was glued to the screen, watching a fantastic story unfold before my eyes - and then it was over. The best movies have a tendency to do that. They immerse you with such force that you literally lose track of time, and this film is a fairly lengthy affair.Most people will have questioned their existence at some point in time, I guess it's in our nature to do so - but not many will have gone to the extremes that the main character does - he quite literally goes through hell and high water, trying to prove to himself (and possibly to everyone else) that life is so much more fulfilling when you take a chance and break the mould - despite the motivations for doing so.A true story, lovingly followed to the letter (literally) by Sean Penn and his ensemble of faithful cast and crew, Into The Wild is one of those movies, that despite it's not-so-Hollywood ending, leaves you with a reason to rekindle a little faith in humanity - and perhaps a tear in your eye.I rate this at 8.2 out of 10. It's original, refreshing and utterly watchable - perhaps multiple times. Brilliant stuff.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Biography"

Touching and misunderstood,"This is a sad true story very touching. For those who judge the main character as selfish, let me tell you that he donates all his money 24 K to charity. I do not consider someone selfish is able to do that.What l consider is the real Chris suffered depression. We should be more compassionate when judging because he could have avoided the trip to Fairbanks if, maybe during his younger years, he had better spiritual guidance. He realized at the end, ""Happiness is only real when shared"" after running away.
Reality is all we have life crisis, times when we lose someone, for example, or we deal with the samsara of life, and we might want to run away. I went to Alaska when my mom passed away from face/breast cancer. It was hard, and l felt devastated for a while, unable to cope. In some way, I can understand how the real Chris might felt when he decided to find a refugee in a bus in Fairbanks, Alaska, in search of inner peace after seeing some samsara in his own life.I will not advise anyone to go and run away but have faith in God, and He will heal you. I wish that happened to Chris. I feel sorry for him and his family. It's a call for us to work more on finding God and counseling. Thank you for reading.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Biography"
Life is beautiful,"This movie is about to live a simple and peaceful life from out of materialistic society.the story begins with Chris graduating from Emory university, a prestigious school in Georgia . A college graduate boy decides to leave his normal life to live a life in wild Alaska with a gun, book and some fruits. The crisis was that he was underestimated and unprepared for what he was up to do, even he did not know how to dry meet. He had a map, could have easily come back to civilisation. He refused all the necessary help to survive in the cold. So it's looks like a committed suicide.Director Sean Penn and Director of photography Eddie Gautier did their best on this film and beautiful and soul full songs from Eddie Vedder. This is a beautiful movie man, no one can deny it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Biography"
beautiful,"Sean Penn is a great actor, a great director as well! ""Into The Wild"" is a real movie event for me. Nowadays the most of the films are so predictable, stupid, banal, lustrous, income concerned......The category ""The 7th Art"" has lost its sense, for that reason films like ""Into The Wild"" are so important, necessary for keeping the cinema alive!This movie hypnotized me, set me free for a while, it was absolute delight for my mind, eyes and ears. Eddie Vedder's songs are wonderful, they have essential contribution to the movie impact on me. His songs are so real and sincere. Emile Hirsch looks so devoted to his role, great actor achievement. William Hurt has a small role, but it is enough for him to show his high level abilities in acting!I recommend warmly this film, I've seen it two times and I'll be glad to see it again!",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Biography"
why bash McCandless?,"First, this is a great movie and I think should be seen by everyone. Now, i am a little disturbed at people who talk bad about McCandless. This guy was not an idiot. He grew up in a family that had many problems and when Chris was old enough he decided he wanted to do something in his life that was different than most. He was going out to have a ""spiritual revolution"" as stated in the movie. He wanted to live off the land in Alaska, with no modern provisions. And, I am sure it was not an attempt to have a movie made about him. To me this guy is a hero. He is someone that most of us strive to be and will never be. He was a man that adventured out on his own, had a hell of a time and made a mistake that cost him his life. And it could happen to any of us if we were to try what he did. But, I have more respect for him than anyone and would have loved to known him as a friend. He ventured out and made something of himself and had he not died, he would have came home a new man, ready to move on from the past disaster with his family. So keep bashing him if you like, but you are the jealous ones that live your miserable lives, regretting not doing something outside the box to make you a better person.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Biography"
Disastrous and crap,I know my opinion varies from millions of people who have given this movie such a high rating. But this is my personal opinion that this movie is disastrous on every ground. A man leaves the society to live in the wild because in society everyone is mean and selfish to each other. And then this man in the wild kills every single living being that comes across him for his own survival. So that's not mean and selifish ? Ever heard of Gautam Buddha who survived an extremely long life in the jungles without hurting a single living being. And this man in this movie hates society and the ways in which this society works. But then he uses the tools invented by this society in the wild to help himself survive. That's not being truly into the wild when you are using a rifle to kill animals and using a mattress and bus for a comfortable living. I wish I could give this movie a negative rating. And what's most disappointing is that this is a real life story of someone. Some people are so lost in their life that they go out of the way to find themselves without realising that they are on the wrong path.,1.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Biography"

Beautiful life story,"I'm not a movie critic, so I will leave all the technical way of describing this movie for people that know about it. For me personally, it is one of the best dramas I've seen. Just having the knowledge that this is someone's real life experiences makes me stop and think about all the beauty that we are all missing for getting attached to material things. For all things we are afraid of experiencing and for situations and people we didn't even give the chance to know. The way that Emile Hirsch got into the character is very strong, very believable. 140 minutes lined very perfectly. And if you like to enjoy a very good soundtrack, I'm pretty sure you won't be disappointed with this one.I hope you enjoy as much as I did.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Biography"
