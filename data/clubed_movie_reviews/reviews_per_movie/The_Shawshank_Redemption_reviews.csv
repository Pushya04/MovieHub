An incredible movie. One that lives with you.,"It is no wonder that the film has such a high rating, it is quite literally breathtaking. What can I say that hasn't said before? Not much, it's the story, the acting, the premise, but most of all, this movie is about how it makes you feel. Sometimes you watch a film, and can't remember it days later, this film loves with you, once you've seen it, you don't forget.The ultimate story of friendship, of hope, and of life, and overcoming adversity.I understand why so many class this as the best film of all time, it isn't mine, but I get it. If you haven't seen it, or haven't seen it for some time, you need to watch it, it's amazing. 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Don't Rent Shawshank.,"I'm trying to save you money; this is the last film title that you should consider borrowing. Renting Shawshank will cost you five bucks... just plunk down the $25 and own the title. You'll wind up going back to this gem time and time again. This is one of few movies that are truly timeless. And it's entertaining and moving, no matter how many times you view it.Forget about what others (including myself) might suggest you'll discover in ""The Shawshank Redemption;"" when you watch it, you'll identify something very personal in your own life with a scene, a character, or a moment in this uncomplicated movie. When you need hope, you'll look for Shawshank. When you want to believe in the will of overcoming even the greatest obstacles, Shawshank will uplift you in ways that you can't find in movies today.Some liken the film to some kind of spiritual awakening. Of course, some can go to a church or mosque to find enlightenment and Faith in humanity, but most places of worship are open only certain days or times. But when you need affirmation of the lasting bond of friendships that prevail over the most dire circumstances, Shawshank will give it to you. It makes grown men (like me) cry, still. I wonder whether Shawshank was truly meant for viewing in the privacy of the home, because it is a personal experience that really makes you look inward. Nominated for seven, this is the best film that never one a single Oscar.How ironic that an innocent man winds up being surrounded by the corruption of the legal system. Shawshank itself is similar to the character of Andy Dufresne. Prejudging this classic film, critics couldn't get past the title. The public followed suit, initially dismissing Shawshank, which failed in the box office just like ""It's a Wonderful Life"" and ""Citizen Kane."" It could have just whithered away on the store shelves, like Andy Dufresne could have in his own cell. But the characters prevailed, because Andy -- And Shawshank -- stayed true. Now, these movies are right up there as the most popular films of all time.Anyone who has yet to watch Shawshank may be so jaded of movies, or the film's title, or how a 2-1/2- hour movie set inside the walls of a prison can manage to tap the soul of such a wide range of people. Shawshank has not one explosion. I wonder if it even has a single special effect or digitally- enhanced frame.But every aspect of Shawshank fit together. The acting from the top to the bit part. The musical score. The editing. The photography. The story, from opening credits to final scene. All involved, including the town of Mansfield, Ohio (where Shawshank was actually filmed) played their roles perfectly. Shawshank is a must- see, must- own title.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
This is How Movies Should Be Made,"This movie is not your ordinary Hollywood flick. It has a great and deep message. This movie has a foundation and just kept on being built on from their and that foundation is hope.Other than just the message of this movie the acting was phenomenal. Tim Robbins gave one of the greatest performances ever. He was inspiring, intelligent and most of all positive. His performance just made me smile. Robbins plays Andy Dufresne who was wrongfully convicted of murdering his wife and her lover. He is gets to life sentences but yet never gives up hope. In he becomes friends with Ellis Boyd ""Red"" Redding played by Morgan Freeman. Freeman who gives the finest performance of his career has unlike Robbins lost hope. He is in deep regret of the crime that he committed. His way of deflecting the pain away is by trying to not feel anything at all. With his friendship with Andy he learns that without our hopes and dreams we have nothing. Andy also becomes friends with the rest of Red's group. James Whitmore also gave a great performance as Brooks Halten who gets out of prison parole but in the words of Red he has been ""institutionalized"".The directing by Frank Darabont was just magnificent. He kept this movie at a great steady pace along with the writing and great cinematography. He portrayed prison life in such a horrifying way, but not in terms of the physical pain but the stress and pain that wares mentally on the inmates, some of which deserve a second chance.Whatever you do, don't listen to the people who say this movie is overrated because this is one of the most inspiring and greatest movies ever. It has everything you could possibly want.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Prepare to be moved,"I have never seen such an amazing film since I saw The Shawshank Redemption. Shawshank encompasses friendships, hardships, hopes, and dreams.  And what is so great about the movie is that it moves you, it gives you hope.  Even though the circumstances between the characters and the viewers are quite different, you don't feel that far removed from what the characters are going through.It is a simple film, yet it has an everlasting message.  Frank Darabont didn't need to put any kind of outlandish special effects to get us to love this film, the narration and the acting does that for him.  Why this movie didn't win all seven Oscars is beyond me, but don't let that sway you to not see this film, let its ranking on the IMDb's top 250 list sway you, let your friends recommendation about the movie sway you.Set aside a little over two hours tonight and rent this movie.  You will finally understand what everyone is talking about and you will understand why this is my all time favorite movie.",,Anonymous,Drama
Shawshank Redeems Hollywood,"Can Hollywood, usually creating things for entertainment purposes only, create art?  To create something of this nature, a director must approach it in a most meticulous manner, due to the delicacy of the process.  Such a daunting task requires an extremely capable artist with an undeniable managerial capacity and an acutely developed awareness of each element of art in their films, the most prominent; music, visuals, script, and acting. These elements, each equally important, must succeed independently, yet still form a harmonious union, because this mixture determines the fate of the artist's opus.  Though already well known amongst his colleagues for his notable skills at writing and directing, Frank Darabont emerges with his feature film directorial debut, The Shawshank Redemption.  Proving himself already a master of the craft, Darabont managed to create one of the most recognizable independent releases in the history of Hollywood.  The Shawshank Redemption defines a genre, defies the odds, compels the emotions, and brings an era of artistically influential films back to Hollywood.The story begins with the trial of a young banker, Andy Dufrense, victimized by circumstantial evidence, resulting in a conviction for the murder of his wife and her lover.  After a quick conviction, Andy finds himself serving a life sentence at Shawshank prison, with no hope of parole.  He exists in this prison only in appearance, keeping his mind free from the drab walls around him.  His ability to do this results in the gaining of respect from his fellow inmates, but most of all from Ellis Redding.  Ellis, commonly referred to as Red, finds gainful use of his entrepreneurial spirit within the drab walls of Shawshank by dealing in contraband and commodities rare to the confines of prison.  Andy's demeanor and undeniable sense of hope causes Red to take a deeper look at himself, and the world around him.  Andy proves to Red and the other inmates that in the conventional walls of Shawshank prison convention will find no home in his lifestyle.By creating the film's firm foundation, the meticulously chiseled screenplay paved the way for this film's success.  Frank Darabont outdoes himself with the phenomenal adaptation of Stephen King's equally noteworthy novella, Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption.  In this novella, King demonstrates that he can break free from the genre he dominates and still create a marvelous piece of modern literature.  Though the film mirrors the novella in many ways, Darabont illustrates a focused objective of improving upon the areas where the novella came up short, resulting in one of the best book to film transitions ever.While maintaining some of the poetic and moving dialogue of the novella, Darabont also proves that a film's score can generate a great deal of emotional response from its audience, as dialogue does.  He employs the cunning Thomas Newman, son of the legendary Hollywood composer, Alfred Newman.  Darabont shows recognition for the film's needs by employing Newman, who makes the gentle piano chords whisper softly to the viewer, as if a part of the scripted dialogue.  Newman lends himself to individualism and tends to drive more towards the unique in the realm of score composition.  His effort in Shawshank did not go unnoticed, as his score received an Oscar nomination in 1995.  While unique and independent, Newman's score never once intrudes on your concentration or distracts from the film.With work from vast array of talented scene designers, costume designers, composers, cinematographers, and various other Hollywood artists, the cast of The Shawshank Redemption had a strong foundation to work with.  The marvelous cast of this film will dazzle you with some of the most convincing performances you will witness in a film.  While both Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman shine as Andy and Red, respectively, the true spectacle of acting lies within the plethora of amazing supporting actors who easily disappear into their roles.  Most noticeable of these, the veteran film star James Whitmore, who portrays the elderly Brooks Hatlen.  Brooks, a man incarcerated for an unmentioned crime for so long that he finds himself attached to the Shawshank and the daily life he has lead.  Each of these actors show a true dedication to their art, and a focused purpose in their motivations, creating a convincing setting that never once caters to anything unbelievable.With all of the aesthetic touches and attention to cinematic detail, the most beautiful part of the film lies within its thematic material, such as its focus on the human desires for the most abstract concepts, like hope and freedom.  These themes, which concern things the human spirit undoubtedly yearns for, seem so intricately woven into the plot that it easily draws its audience in to its story.  Though full of hardened criminals, your heart will go out to these men as they display the most basic of human emotions, and deliver some of the most quotable lines in a film to date.  Like a great novel, this film manages to succeed at greater things than simply entertaining an audience.  Darabont tells his story most masterfully, illustrating principles and inspiring his audience to think.  He leaves us a poignant film with a powerful message of hope, and redemption, something we all seek.This film manages to redeem Hollywood in the eyes of people who feared it long lost in a dark sea of clichés and predictability.  Darabont shows us that artists still work in the Hollywood studios and production facilities. These artists show their capability to produce art; real art that inspires you to look at the deeper aspects of life and the world around you.  The Shawshank Redemption delivers much-needed breath of fresh air for anyone who realizes the capability of film.  It proves that masters of the craft still live on this earth, and still bless us with timeless masterpieces that we will never forget.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama

Eternal Hope,"I've lost count of the number of times I have seen this movie, but it is more than 20. It has to be one of the best movies ever made. It made me take notice Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins like I had never noticed any actors before.I have from a very young age been a huge fan of anything Stephen King writes and had already read the short story that this movie is based on years prior to seeing this movie.Not everything Stephen King has written that gets turned into a movie comes out well, but this is as close to perfection as it gets and has everything you could ever want in a movie.Something that is outstanding is the fact that it has no real action, no special effects and no gimmicks. 99% of the movie is just men in a prison uniforms talking. Yet it absolutely hooks you almost from the beginning and has you glued to the screen to the end.For me what really makes this film one of the best is the message of eternal hope it conveys throughout. The never ever give up hope attitude of the main character so well conveyed by Tim Robbins. The ending is just spine tingling every time I see it, no matter how many times I have seen it.Brilliant, brilliant movie and a must see for everyone.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
The Shawshank Redemption,"One of the finest films made in recent years. It's a poignant story about hope. Hope gets me. That's what makes a film like this more than a movie. It tells a lesson about life. Those are the films people talk about 50 or even 100 years from you. It's also a story for freedom. Freedom from isolation, from rule, from bigotry and hate. Freeman and Robbins are majestic in their performances. Each learns from the other. Their relationship is strong and you feel that from the first moment they make contact with one another. There is also a wonderful performance from legend James Whitmore as Brooks.He shines when it is his time to go back into the world, only to find that the world grew up so fast he never even got a chance to blink. Stephen King's story is brought to the screen with great elegance and excitement. It is an extraordinary motion that people ""will"" be talking about in 50 or 100 years.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
IMDb and the Greatest Film of All Time,"Two imprisoned men (Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman) bond over a number of years, finding solace and eventual redemption through acts of common decency.Is this the greatest film of all time? IMDb would have you believe so. Despite being a box office flop (that barely recouped its budget), the film received multiple award nominations and outstanding reviews from critics for its acting, story, and realism. It has since been successful on cable television, VHS, DVD, and Blu-ray.And it deserves this praise that seems to be growing each year. Now twenty years old, the film has not aged a day, and instead seems to be getting better. This is Tim Robbins' best role, and a fine performance from the always wonderful Morgan Freeman.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Stephen King's best adapted movie,"Misery and Stand By Me were the best adaptations up until this one, now you can add Shawshank to that list.This is simply one of the best films ever made and I know I am not the first to say that and I certainly won't be the last. The standing on the IMDb is a true barometer of that. #3 as of this date and I'm sure it could be number 1. So I'll just skip all the normal praise of the film because we all know how great it is. But let me perhaps add that what I find so fascinating about Shawshank is that Stephen King wrote it.King is one of the best writers in the world. Books like IT and the Castle Rock series are some of the greatest stories ever told. But his best adaptations are always done by the best directors. The Shining was brilliantly interpreted by Kubrick and of course the aforementioned Misery and Stand By Me are both by Rob Reiner. Now Frank Darabont comes onto the scene and makes arguably the best King film ever. He seems to understand what King wants to say and he conveys that beautifully.What makes this film one of the best ever made is the message it conveys. It is one of eternal hope. Andy Dufresne, played by Tim Robbins, has been sent to prison for a crime he did not commit. But he never loses hope. He never gives up his quest to become a free man again. His years of tenacity, patience and wits keep him not only sane, but it gives his mind and a spirit a will to live. This film has a different feel to it. There has never been anything like it before and I don't know if there will again.I'm not going to say any more about this film, it has already been said, but just suffice to say that I am glad that Forrest Gump won best picture in 94. I would have been equally glad if Pulp Fiction or Shawshank would have won. It is that good of a movie and one that will be appreciated for years to come.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Mystery,"I still can't quite get the enormous reputation of this film. I saw it again last night and instead of clearing up the mystery, the mystery got thicker. It is enjoyable film with very good performances by Tim Robbins, Morgan Freeman, James Whitmore etc, but...the most highly rated film ever? I don't get it. The voice over alone seems to belong to a so so film. I love Morgan Freeman's voice but he's telling us what we're seeing. So, the sterling reputation damages the enjoyment of the film because one is expecting something that never, really, arrives. The most interesting aspect is Tim Robbins's psychological journey. Credible or incredible doesn't quite matter, I did go with him without asking too many questions. Morgan Freeman's humanity is contagious and inspiring, whether credible or not because I bought it. So, a masterpiece? No. Good, even very good? Yes.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama
"Simply known as ""The Movie""","Whenever I talk about this movie with my friends, I do not even refer to it by title, but rather as ""The Movie"".  When I say ""The Movie"", my friends know exactly what I'm talking about.  In fact the main reason that me and my friends don't refer to it by title is because this movie is so great, that we do not feel worthy enough to say it's name in vain! I still remember the first time I saw The Shawshank Redemption.  Some friends of mine and I went to see it at one of those ""Budget Theaters"" over the summer of 1995.  None of us really knew anything about the movie, but we had heard that it was pretty good.  So, not having any real expectations, we saw it.  When the final credits rolled and the lights came on in the theater, all of us just sat there with our jaws hanging down on the floor. I turned my head towards my friend Bob and said ""That was the greatest movie I have ever seen in my entire life!"" There's really no other way I can put it in words.  Every moment of this movie captivated me and inspired me to believe in the one true thing in life...... ""HOPE"".  This movie is sad, uplifting, inspiring, harsh, cold, funny (at the right times), jaw-dropping, and heart-warming all at the same time.  I get chills every time I watch this film and this film contains the greatest ending (which takes place over the last 30 minutes or so)in movie history!  How it all just ""comes together"" is so incredible and uplifting. I should also mention the music in this movie is nearly flawless as well, and the soundtrack is a ""must buy"" for any music fan. The only bad thing about this movie is the fact that I know I will never see a better movie, no matter how many I may see.  I've seen many movies over the past few years, many excellent films.  However, every time I walk out of the theater, I turn to my friend or family member that I saw it with and I say, ""That was a great movie, but it wasn't nearly as good as 'you know what'!""  There have been many movies over the past few years that thought would really move me or that I might one day call my ""favorite of all time"", but they've all fallen far short of ""The Shawshank Redemption"". So, if you have yet to see this movie, please run to the video store immediately.  You're guaranteed to find it in the ""employee picks"" section. And if it isn't in that section, then you should tell the employees there that there is something seriously wrong with them.  If you have seen this movie, go see it again.  If you haven't bought your own copy yet, buy one. In fact buy two, and put one in a fire-proof safe, just in case of an emergency. :o) So, you want a 1-10 rating???

"Good movie, but best of all time? Hardly . . .","I was a little surprised at first to see this film ranked #1 out of all possible candidates in the IMDB user ratings. When I thought about it, though, it made more sense--this is a ""Rocky""-type feel-good movie that doesn't really make you think and reinforces what we would all like to believe about human nature. Don't get me wrong--it's a fine film (I gave it a solid 7 out of 10), it's just not, in my view, up there with _Casablanca_ and _The Graduate_.I guess the main problem I have with _Shawshank_ is the nature of the script and characters. Think about it: is there a single person in the film who isn't a one-dimensional cardboard cut-out with very simple motivations, or a Hollywood cliche or stereotype? We have (in no particular order), a corrupt, bigoted prison warden (who is a religious hypocrite for good measure), a brutal prison guard, a man who is wrongly accused of murder, an old convict who knows all the ropes and can't live on the outside, and a convict who is murdered by the brutal guards. Now where have we seen this stuff before? Only in a few dozen movies made from the 20s to the 90s. There's really nothing new here. Probably this comes from the fact that the story is from Stephen King, who doesn't really do well with complex characters (a problem I noted as far back as _Carrie_).If you want to see a good prison picture, try _Cool Hand Luke_ (from which this movie borrows considerably). If you want an escape picture, see either _The Great Escape_ or _Papillon_, both with Steve McQueen. Or if, by some chance, you want a crime and punishment movie that really makes you think, go with the late great Stanley Kubrick's _A Clockwork Orange_.I couldn't stop thinking about the warden: doesn't he have a family? How did they feel? What are they going to do now? I realize the story is inside the prison, but I wish the movie had made better use of its characters than simply as simple-minded symbols of EVIL or VIRTUE.I'm not Mr. Cranky, I did enjoy the movie, but I enjoyed it the same way I do an Italian dinner at the Olive Garden--a well-constructed genre product with nothing special to commend it.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama

Here goes.This movie is just bloody excellent, brilliant, fantastic, unbelievable, not a thing wrong with it, shocking (in a good way), heck, pretty much every single good comment word you can think of.I mean, for gods sake, its so damn good it takes your breath away! i seriously could not speak after it! it instantly took every other film i had seen under its shadow, and that's saying something, as i have seen some pretty excellent films.There's not a single actor or actress in this movie who is crap!!! standouts are Morgan freeman, Tim Robbins, and the dude who plays brooks.I could say 1239643609260246704272628xinfinity more things good about this movie, but unfortunately I haven't got that much space, and my fingers would get sore.An absolute must see for everyone, and I'm positive that ill never see another movie better than this, and this will stay at #1 on my list forever.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Over Rated,"There is no denying that this is a very good movie. The acting is great and it tells a good story.Personally, I find it a bit too long and a little too sweet for my taste, but its far from a bad film.On the other end of the spectrum I have yet to understand why this film was nominated for as many Oscars as it was and why so many people have fallen in love with it. To place it on the same level as The Godfather and several hundred other films has to be the result of different tastes.This is a film that should be seen because its a good movie, not because its a great one.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama
"Decent film, highly overrated","I finally decided to see this film after reading good reviews and noting that this film ranks in IMDB's top ten list (currently #2). At the very least I disovered where all the noble people are: they're in prison!The film is decent, but it certainly isn't what I would call great or extraordinary. There are good performances by Robbins and Freeman, but the pace of the movie is very slow and the cinematography is unremarkable. Characters are largely stereotypes, the story is somewhat formulaic (and sometimes ludicrous), and the noble prisoners vs wicked guards dichotomy is simplistic and unrealistic. I was also particularly annoyed at the narration, which always seemed to explain more than it needed to. As for the ending, I guess I was not as suprised as others since I did read the Stephen King novella many years ago. Still, given that the story takes place in a prison, you don't need to be a genius to guess part of it.This movie reminds me of Dead Poets Society in terms of its tone and theme of uplifting the human spirit against a backdrop of despair. If that's your thing, you'll love the movie. It's not really my thing.5/10",5.0,Anonymous,Drama
Greatest movie of all time!,"This movie is one of my all time favorites. Undoubtedly, one of the most brilliant movies I have ever seen. Story, cast, screenplay all are great. The directing by Frank Darabont was just magnificent. The amazing casting of both Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins is amazing, and couldn't be more accurate. It was narrated by Morgan Freeman, who is the best narrator in Hollywood, I believe. Actually the film depends on the story and the way in which it unravels. It will change the way u think about things around u. Surely, It will teach you one thing that it is easy to take away a man's bread, even his freedom, but impossible to take away his hope.I can say with confidence this is the best movie I have ever seen - or ever will see.

never give up hope,"""The Shawshank Redemption"" should have won Best Picture for 1994. A story of banker Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) getting falsely convicted of murder and sent to the hellish Shawshank prison, the movie is beyond amazing. In prison, Andy meets Ellis Boyd ""Red"" Redding (Morgan Freeman), who was imprisoned many years earlier. Red gets Andy a poster of Rita Hayworth. Over the next twenty years, Andy experiences all the horrors that one would expect in jail: beatings by the guards, rapes by other inmates, and so on. But he never gives up hope.This movie, like ""Carrie"", ""The Shining"", ""Dolores Claiborne"", ""The Green Mile"" and ""Hearts in Atlantis"", just goes to show what a great author Stephen King is. When we think of horror, we think of spooky horror, but ""The Shawshank Redemption"" is a different kind: personal horror. Pure genius. I can only hope that in the coming years, this movie is recognized as what it is: a masterpiece. I can't believe that it won no Oscars!",10.0,Anonymous,Drama

A movie about an innocent clever man who learns to live within prison walls.,"This is Tim Robbins best performance ever. It is a compelling heart warming drama about an innocent man(Andy Dufresbe) who is sent to prison and learns to use his intelligence to make the best of prison life. He meets a mentor in Red(Morgan Freeman) and they build a friendship that is stronger than the walls that surround them. Andy steadies a relationship with the warden that keeps him in the good eyes of the prison. Andy is full of surprises and uses his resourcefulness to not only win the friendships of his fellow prisoners, but also of the prison guards. Both Andy and Red both hold on to their dream of one day enjoying their freedom. They turn their friendship and dreams of freedom into a bond that no prison could ever take away.",,Anonymous,Drama

"Prison thriller with violence, hatred, corruption, friendship and joy.","""The Shawshank Redemption"" is a timeless story of heartbreak, deception and ultimate growth under the most deplorable conditions.The acting is superior, some of Tim Robbins' and Morgan Freeman's best work as they allow me an intimate look inside the sometimes contradictory nature of a convict's existence, where I am torn emotionally between danger and safety, light and shadow, sanity and sorrow, truth and lies, injustice and justice. In fact, I am lost in all the actors' poignant and memorable portrayals of young thugs, cruel guards, swindlers, thieves, rapists and murders, all standing in their respective spaces quietly listening together to an operatic aria over a loudspeaker on the prison yard.In this movie, I find almost no one to be all good or all bad. There are exceptions, though. Although there are those in charge of the prison I wish to be caught in a snare of their own making or worse, there are still others behind prison walls that turn out to be heroes I cheer on to win in the end. Like people in real life, most of the characters in ""The Shawshank Redemption,"" both prisoners and guards (those that are not miserably rotten to the bone), represent many shades of gray.One of the most touching moments in ""The Shawshank Redemption"" is a scene in which an elderly convict, who has spent the better part of his adult life locked up, is brokenheartedly paroled into a modern world that is as alien to him as his outdated suit and boyhood memories. And his fear of this new and unnatural terrain, crawling with shadier creatures than those he had known behind bars and the exhaust fumes of a thousand horseless carriages rushing past, engulfed him with no hope of ever escaping.""Fear can hold you prisoner. Hope can set you free,"" from ""The Shawshank Redemption.""As bonds form between people of different ethnic groups, economic backgrounds and intellectual levels, I rejoice in their discovery of the human dignity they share. As the story unfolds, my heart hurts so hard, I cry. Then, with tears still in my eyes, I laugh, the same way my family used to laugh together at dinner or a movie when I was a little girl.Getting older. Times changing. People leaving. Dying.But at the core of the main character's spirit there shines upon all those who are within its range, including me, a contagious hope eternal. I am still astonished with the euphoria that fills my being each time I view this incredible story about the invincible human spirit.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
The closest thing to poetic perfection Hollywood has ever produced,"This touching and heart warming film is the most perfect celebration of the human spirit I have seen. Andy Dufresne, wrongly convicted of murdering his wife and her lover, finds the strength not only to change himself, but to bring hope to those around him in Shawshank Prison.  This inspiring story is interwoven with a soundtrack which invokes every emotion, from haunting and chilling, to stirring and beautiful. When you go to see a movie and it touches you with its poetry, music, and its atmosphere, and leaves you with a sense of victorious satisfaction, it is a triumph.  Field of Dreams was the first movie which invoked these emotions in me.  Shawshank Redemption is even more powerful for its simplicity.  It doesn't pretend to be clean, nor could it be called a family movie.  It is brutal and violent at times, horrifying and sickening at others. However the title says it all. Redemption is what this story is all about.  And it is not necessarily redemption for the actual crimes you might have committed, but it is redemption for the way you have lived your life.  What emerges can only be called a maginificent piece of art.  This is what movies were meant to be.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
"When There is Life, There is Hope; When There is Hope, There is Life","Like many of the reviewers, I hate prison movies with all the clichés and stereotypes of innocent prisoners, nasty guards, and evil wardens; and upon first viewing, many years ago, I especially disliked being forced by this film to feel sympathy and empathy with murderers, rapists and the like.Shawshank has somehow transcended the test of time; and I believe that it has endured, not because of the great performances (which don't seem to be acting at all, but real), not because of the simple, but multi-level, story line with its twists and turns, not because of its magnificent photography, not because of its score, and not because of any individual element that went into the making of this film. (Hence, the lack of academy awards.) However, when all those elements are combined, Shawshank becomes one of those masterpieces which is greater than the sum of its parts...and this film is so much greater that in the desperation of its characters, it invokes a multitude of good emotions in the viewer...that there is divine, poetic justice and hope in this hell of a world.Shawshank has become my favorite film of all time, but it took a while.

Sublimely powerful.,"It deserves ten stars. Its beauty lies in its slow pace and genteel wit, although some may not have the patience for the slowness. But the whole premise of life inside a prison cell makes better sense when told in a calm, emotion-building, pace such as this. Otherwise, one would never get to know Tim Robbins's quiet accountant (and what makes him appear alternately shy, snobbish, and suicidal all at the same time); or Morgan Freeman's genial-but-cynical lifer- not to mention how he's ""a man who knows how to get things."" I love what the film doesn't do: it doesn't make an issue of its two leads being different races (although one could claim that makes their friendship all the more marvelous), it doesn't pull any sensational, far-out, action punches (as films with an all-male cast often do), and it doesn't freeze its characters into types. Everyone is real and everyone is flawed- from James Whitmore's bird loving veteran to Bob Gunton's pretentious, icy, warden. But the finish (which really starts around the film's last twenty minutes) is one of the most powerful and moving things ever committed to film. Get it in either format.",,Anonymous,Drama
Not That Great,"This movie offers less in terms of plot twists, character development and acting than what I think people realise. Morgan Freeman delivers a characteristically mundane performance and the other characters dance forgettably around him.There are few to no memorable quotes and even less action, and the only real twist, at the end, could be the most overrated twist of all time.I only watched this after it was deemed a must by most of my close peers and fellow movie critics, only to be gravely disappointed with their judgments. If this movie has taught me anything, it is that IMDb ratings mean jack and that people are, in general, conformist in nature ; they rate movies highly if their fellow humans talk it up. Who could forget the terrible acting and the sexual innuendos in this movie? The only reason that the director put that in there was to make it feel more prison like, but for me it felt as if he was trying to plug a bathtub with a million holes. A tub full of vomit to begin with.Frankly, I do not care if this is an unpopular view. And neither should you.

An extraordinary and unforgettable film about a bank veep who is convicted of murders and sentenced to the toughest prison,"Superbly played film set in 1946 , a bright young New England banker is convicted of the slayings of his spouse and her lover and sentenced to life at a strict State Prison . Introspective and quite Andy (Tim Robbins) gradually befriends inmates and over the next 2 decades wins the trust of prisoners and wardens but in his heart he still yearns for freedom . There he forms a peculiar friendship with Red (Morgan Freeman), the prison fixer , he experiences the brutality of prison life with a sadistic head guard (Clancy Brown), and is also mistreated and raped ; however , he adapts himself and offers financial advice to the guards and the selfish governor (Bob Gunton) , all in a shot 19 years. As two imprisoned men bond over a number of years, finding peace and redemption through acts of common help , friendship and decency . But when the proof of Andy's innocence is ripped away by those who need his services ,we learn that all is not quite what it seems at this State Penitentary , provoking a few susprises in the last two reels .This is a very good and serious prison movie with thrills , emotion , exciting scenes , colour-blind relationships , hardnut camaraderie , gang opression , and violent disavowal of any homosexual implications . Prison buffs will find a lot of incidents to relish and the great spiritual resolution takes some swallowing and unexpected surprises . Adapted from the novella ¨Rita Hayworth and Shawshank redemption¨ ; the twist here is the upright starring is exceptionally bright , as his ability with accountancy leads to his handling the finances of everyone , from the humblest guard to the prison boss . Wonderful spectacle in watching time-passer while changing the bombshell actresses of the history : Rita Hayworth , Marilyn Monroe , Raquel Welch . US prison films have been making solid fares for more than sixty years and apart from slowness of pace in the second half , this one is well up to prison standards . This Frank Darabont's theatrical debut turns out to be a throwback rendition to the kind of literate , thought-provoking prison drama Hollywood used to make , such as : I am a fugitive from a chain gang , Birdman of Alcatraz and Escape from Alcatraz .Tim Robbins plays magnificently Andy , an inmate finding solace and eventual redemption , Tim provides his usual talent for playing ambiguous roles , as his notable skills are put to good use. Along with Robbins' best screen acting there are various Oscar-worthy supporting characters with special mention for Morgan Freeman as the good fixer who brings his ordinary grace to what could have been a thankless role , the veteran James Withmore as the crow-keeping librarian , the sympathetic newcomer inmate Gil Bellows ,William Sadler , Mark Rolston and the ruthless guardian Clancy Brown and , of course , the egoistic and nasty governor excellently played by Bob Gunton .It contains a colorful and evocative cinematography by Roger Deakins . And an enjoyable and really feeling musical score by Thomas Newman . In his engrossing direction debut ,Darabont avoids boring by fleeing most prison movie cliches . It results to be a pleasure of discovering a first-time filmmaker with evident respect for the intelligence of his audience , giving sensitive scenes , and brave enough to let roles details accumulate without recourse the excessively maudlin and over-sentimentality. It is a true masterpiece , being marvelously acted and perfectly paced.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama

Highly Overrated But Still Good,"A good prison movie whose cult of fans has made it into something so much more than it is. Greatest movie ever made? Get real. It's not even the greatest prison movie ever made. Hell, it's not even the best movie released in 1994! It's predictable and borrows heavily from decades of prison movie clichés. It's also nowhere near as deep as its staunchest admirers would have you believe. Still, it's an entertaining movie. Nice direction from Frank Darabont. Morgan Freeman is the highlight with a solid supporting cast. Tim Robbins, however, is borderline ridiculous at times with his cartoonish facial expressions and silly ""stares-off-into-the-distance"" moments. He's so far beneath Freeman as an actor it's sad. With a normal movie like this, I would focus more on the positives. I did give it a 7, after all.

Andy being a banker convicted of murder and Red a murderer already serving time, this movie takes you to the limits of human endurance, where the human spirit eventually prevails.The TSR takes you on an emotional journey that you will remember for a long time, thanks to the superb crafting of the film and sincere performances by the cast. The score is deep and haunting, this film is for the ages and will permenantly have a place in my heart.

"""I have to remind myself that some birds aren't meant to be caged""","""Every mind has billions of ideas and each one of us do things that no one expects us to do, some of those things are visible, some not but one of those things that make our life worth living is FREEDOM""Tim Robbins stars as Andy Dufresne, a young man who faces a long, long time in prison after he is wrongfully found guilty of murdering his wife and her lover. While inside he learns an awful lot about what a man can hold onto and let himself be put through if there is still an ounce of hope in his soul. Bottles of cool drink on a hot rooftop, a slowly building library collection, the moment of musical joy that sees Dufresne severely punished for his overstepping of the mark and many other scenes spring to mind as classic moments in a movie almost chock full of classic moments. Andy quickly gets befriended by ""Red"" (Morgan Freeman), actually the narrator of the story, both soon prove that even in the worst circumstances, within the ""hell on earth"" they can maintain human dignity and strive on their own way to freedom... Morgan Freeman is the film's secret strength, playing ""the guy who can get it for you"" with a note of welcome ambiguity. Watching him in an early scene, when a fat, new convict (fresh fish) is being beaten by cruel head guard Captain Hadley (Clancy Brown), you don't know whether Red looks so crestfallen for the victim or for the packs of cigarettes he just lost betting the guy wouldn't break before Dufresne James Whitmore was equally memorable as a prisoner who was unable to adjust to the outside after his parole following a 50 year stint. This shows that people who have been incarcerated for such a long period, need some sort of readjustment training before they rejoin society. For Whitmore, freedom meant ultimate doom, making the scene one of my all-time favorite displaying the ultimate dark side and a certain fear in freedom. Tim Robbins, Morgan Freeman along with James Whitmore etched unforgettable performances as prisoners charged with crime. The film shows what prison life is all about. Subjects dealing with prison survival, brutality, corruption and ultimate redemption are well shown. An outstanding film dealing with prisons as seen by several prisoners. Many social problems are discussed here. The picture earned a well-deserved best picture Oscar nomination.

Hope is a Good Thing. Maybe the Best of Things. And No Good Thing Ever Dies.,"Out of the three genre-defining classics released in 1994, The Shawshank Redemption was the one that ended up bearing the maximum brunt. First commercially by failing to recover its budget for it debuted in theatres together with one of cinema's greatest watershed events; Pulp Fiction. And then at Academy Awards where it was nominated for seven Oscars yet failed to win any, thanks to the sweeping show by the critics' darling, Forrest Gump.But life ever since has been very kind to this film, and both critics & viewers have embraced its uplifting story of hope & friendship with remarkable amount of respect, love & kindness. Today, The Shawshank Redemption enjoys a position that's arguably even higher than the two classics which eclipsed it back in 1994 and while it was discarded at its time of release, it is now rightly & universally acknowledged as one of the greatest films of all time.The Shawshank Redemption tells the story of Andy Dufresne, a successful banker, who is wrongfully convicted of murdering his wife & her illicit lover and is ultimately sentenced to two consecutive life terms in prison where his coping with the brutal hardships of confined life slowly earns him the respect of his fellow inmates & prison staff, including that of ""Red"" in whom Andy finds a trusted ally. The remainder of the film explores their friendship over the next two decades.Written & directed by Frank Darabont, this prison drama is a simple but profoundly moving tale of hope, friendship & redemption that'll manage to connect deeply with most of us in one way or another plus it also marks Darabont's directional debut and he couldn't have asked for a better start. All this film has is men in either prison or police uniforms talking to one another over the course of its runtime and yet it never looked dull or felt like dragging at any given moment.Cinematography exquisitely captures the monotonous daily life inside prison and provides considerable depth & realism to the era this film is set in. Every moment of despair has a shadowy appearance while moments of hope gleam with light. Editing is spectacular too as the gradual progression of Andy's life, his friendship with Red, and his determination to not give in to the four walls containing him is effectively unfolded. And Thomas Newman's score beautifully blends with the film's tone & characters' lives, and is emotionally fulfilling.Coming to the performances, Tim Robbins delivers a swashbuckling performance as Andy Dufresne, the banker wrongfully convicted for the crime he didn't commit. And if Robbins is at his best, then Morgan Freeman is even better as Red, Andy's friend who is also serving a life sentence & is notorious amongst the inmates for he can smuggle goods into the prison. Freeman also narrates the story to us at which he does an even better job. His work is grounded & can go easily unnoticed, but the character of Red is the soul of this story.There is a reason why this film still connects with so many people & why many of them have latched on to it. There is a reason why even after two decades, its legacy keeps flourishing & viewers keep returning to it despite its low entertainment value. One major reason is that even though The Shawshank Redemption is a prison drama, its story of imprisonment goes far beyond the bricks & steel rods of a jailhouse. The entire picture is a reflection of our own imprisonment in the institutions of our daily lives; institutions like work, family, society etc & living up to the expectations of each one of them.On an overall scale, The Shawshank Redemption stresses that based on the outlook of life, there are only two types of people: one who can be free even in prison while others who find themselves imprisoned even in freedom. The message it is trying to resonate is clear: Fear can hold you prisoner, Hope can set you free. And if we all give ourselves some hope, there is nothing we can't survive. Yes, it all seems preachy n everything, but then if there's ever been a motion picture that has earned this sort of right, it's The Shawshank Redemption. Strongly recommended.",,Anonymous,Drama
Stephen King's prison tale with a happy ending...,"THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION is a kind of morality tale that is definitely one of Stephen King's more restrained kind of stories, dealing mostly with a character study of two individuals sharing imprisonment and the consequences that await them when the tale ends.TIM ROBBINS is a man wrongly convicted of murder and serving a long prison term while MORGAN FREEMAN (who plays the narrator with great dignity) describes himself as ""the only guilty man in Shawshank."" The hardships of prison life are captured in brief scenes that make the viewer wish that Robbins will find a way of escape.Along the way, he is gang raped by prisoners and treated harshly by a brutal warden and some of his spirit seems to vanish. But Robbins is quietly effective as a prisoner who makes a good adjustment when he takes charge of the prison library and sees to it that there's a wider selection of books than the kind of potboilers that King is noted for writing. A touch of irony here, no? The closing scenes are a bit of a stretch and a reminder of just who wrote this prison tale--but still, they make an impact because of all that happens before.It's a bittersweet story, a sort of horrific fairy-tale of what might have happened, but the viewer will be caught up in the story because of the tremendously skillful story-telling magic of Stephen King and director Frank Darabont who also wrote the screenplay.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama
"Tedious, overlong, with ""hope"" being the second word spoken in just about every sentence... who cares?","I simply fail to understand how this film is so popular... it's quite simply beyond me. The only way I can explain it is that all the fans of King's short story found it very true to the spirit of the book, and voted 10 for that. I really could not find anything worth my time in this film, and apart from a very good monologue from Freeman near the end, one or two good lines of dialog and the acting, there's really nothing in the whole film worth watching it for. It's about hope... and the director won't let us forget it, so it's repeated until the audience mumbles it in our sleep. It's like this short, one-note story was written, and the author just didn't want to end it... so he kept writing... and writing... until someone had the sense to break down the door and wrestle the pen from him yelling ""for the love of all that is holy, stop writing!"" And I thank that faceless man for doing that, because it is undoubtedly the only reason the film was 142 minutes long, and not 284, or, dare I say it, 568. The film simply drones on and on, scene after scene, containing nothing remotely interesting(but with excellent acting, mind you). There's nothing good about this film except for the acting. Just about all of it is great. I can't really think of anything else to say... I guess my dislike for the film stems from my hatred of King's writing. I suppose it is possible for someone who is neutral on his works to enjoy this film. I recommend this to fans of Stephen King, the actors and possibly Frank Darabont. If you're not a fan of any of these people, I doubt you'd find this enjoyable. 5/10",5.0,Anonymous,Drama

One of the Best If You Get It,"People look for all sorts of things in movies, and you can see it in the occasional negative review that pops up for this movie.  Some viewers are looking for gritty realism in everything on the screen.  Others are action junkies.  Still others perhaps take film too seriously and reduce moviemaking to nothing more than a game of who can come up with the edgiest shot, or the niftiest angle.  For all of these, there is the very real chance that they simply will not ""get"" this film, and that's too bad -- they are missing out on a classic.At its best, film can transcend merely being a series of pictures, no matter how pretty, and can reach down and touch people.  That is where Shawshank succeeds so brilliantly.  It is not the fastest moving movie, not the edgiest, not the grittiest, it is filmed in shades of gray.

absurdly overrated,"This movie is absurdly overrated by people who think soppy affirmative moviemaking accompanied by a lush score is synonymous with aesthetic brilliance.The direction is nothing to write home about, the cinematography is, frankly, standard.  The script has Steven King written all over it - a melodramatic plot involving the woes of an educated bloke told in overwrought dialogue full of clumsy metaphors.  (A good example: the moment when the scriptwriter decided that the prisoner's interest in geology had to be spelled out for the dumber members of the audience ""It's all about TIME and PRESSURE..."" just in case anyone managed to miss the connection). Morgan Freeman is, as usual, superb but Tim Robbins is inconsistent as a man who goes from being the gaol newcomer to an old hand.

Better Late Then Never,"Along with Q and Pulp Fiction, Frank Darabont (The Walking Dead original writer) and his debut film got screwed by the Hollywood Powerhouse that is Tom Hanks with this now can be considered an American Classic. The fact that this film barely and I emphasize barely made it's money back in US theaters (which is usually a signal for a film to turn into a DOA when released at home) and it made such a splash, that the film is exceeding what anyone thought a simple 18 years ago. This includes some of Hollywood's best critics including EW's Owen Gleiberman who originally gave the film a B- back in late '94. Yet over time, this story of redemption, like the rise of hope this film gives from beginning to end, grows on you to the point where at the very end, you have no choice but to clap (I clapped in my basement in front of my parents and I haven't looked the same since). Darabont found a formula that worked and it shows in his future films. He made Robbins human, made Morgan Freeman's voice as American as a Big Mac and made the late great Rita Hayworth relevant again. The only regret that one should have is the fact that if it was released two years later it would've swept away the Oscars (Sorry Ralph Fiennes, The English Patient won on a weak year.)",10.0,Anonymous,Drama

Morgan Freeman makes us feel the sadness and Tim Robbins, the faith. The more times you watch it, the more you love it, and the more you learn from it. Whatever you do, don't listen to the people who say this movie is overrated because this is one of the most inspiring and greatest film. It has everything you could possibly want in a movie.

Their characters navigate the complexities of life behind bars, revealing layers of human emotion and moral introspection.Darabont's direction is masterful, capturing both the brutality and humanity within Shawshank Penitentiary with equal measure. The cinematography beautifully contrasts the confinement of the prison walls with the vastness of hope symbolized by Andy's determined spirit.The screenplay intricately weaves together themes of justice, redemption, and the enduring power of the human spirit. Each character, no matter how minor, contributes to the film's rich tapestry, reinforcing its message of resilience and the quest for inner freedom.Thomas Newman's evocative score complements the narrative perfectly, enhancing the emotional depth of key moments without overshadowing the film's poignant silence.""The Shawshank Redemption"" is more than just a prison drama; it is a timeless testament to the indomitable nature of hope and the triumph of the human spirit against all odds.

"The UNIVERSALITY OF SHAWSHANK: ANDY DESFRENE AS ""EVERYMAN""","WHAT is the highest rated movie in the history of CINEMA??? Just in case You DIDN'T know... it is SHAWSHANK!If you have never seen SHAWSHANK, this review is aimed, primarily, at you. I suppose there must be a few of you out there!?!? ...What is quite difficult to fathom is that anyone with any REAL interest in Cinema could have managed to avoid seeing it for the 30 years since its release!In a Perfect World, SHAWSHANK is the movie of choice. What a serendipitous confluence of diverse and inspired elements! It is the exception that proves the Murphy's Law rule. Just look at the IMDb breakdown analysis of the vote...In every area of human activity, there is always that ""2%""! SHAWSHANK is no exception. Precisely 2% of voters rated SHAWSHANK 1 Star! I invite you to check!In our culture there is a recurring undercurrent nightmare scenario of long-term wrongful imprisonment. Make that a Universal scenario, perhaps, in ALL cultures. Not a SPOILER here, because this point is clearly established in the opening 5 minutes. SHAWSHANK is the ultimate Black/White ""BRO-mance""...Yet, uniquely, Morgan Freeman's character, ""Red"", is anything but the pre-destined to an untimely end sidekick...The entire film is literally narrated from Red's perspective. Thusly...If anything, Red's ""Main-Man"" prison status gives him a bit of a dominant role in their relationship. But the interaction of their characters is clearly that of 2 equals, gradually morphing into one of lifelong best BUDS!I can't help but wonder if, while cast and crew were in the midst of making SHAWSHANK, any of them imagined the magnitude of the cinematic milestone they were involved in! Box Office results are rather jaw-dropping, but in a negative sense: Opening Weekend-A starkly paltry Position #144 among 1994 releases of just $750K U. S.! Overall 1994 Box Office, did not even make the Top 50! SHAWSHANK occupied a lackluster Spot #51, to be exact, with just over $28 Million taken in!A theater trailer piqued my interest, but I had to go by myself...My wife, who is a rather avid movie goer herself, said...""H-m-m-m-m, a prison drama?....What's the Title?"" After hearing it, she responded, ""The SHAW-What? No...I PASS!"" Well, needless to say, after a first viewing, my was awe complete and unmitigated, so I insisted on dragging her along just days later, for my second viewing. My wife became an instant SHAWSHANK believer. We both categorize this film in our lifetime top 5 favorites! Perhaps SHAWSHANK got off to such an inauspicious Box Office start for the same reasons that almost resulted in my wife NOT going to see it in 1994!I could literally write volumes on this movie, but, of course cannot here! A few more highlights: Interestingly, 7 Oscar Nominations, but ZER0 wins! Had the amazingly bad luck of having to compete with the mighty feel-good classic, FORREST GUMP, which steamrolled that year with 6 Oscars and #1 at the Box Office with $330 Million, about 12X SHAWSHANK's $$$! Wonder what the Academy's members take on this would be today? Just look at the 7 categories where it was nominated...Each one is exquisitely superb! Not a single Golden Statuette...WOW!As far as Suspension of Disbelief is concerned, in the self-contained and totally insulated prison environment, it isn't much of a stretch to imagine an Old-Testament thumping Warden anointing himself with almost god-like powers! Stranger things have happened, yes? In one odd twist, when one thinks of Illegal Immigration, MEXICO, or Central America, to the USA invariably is the route that comes to mind...not the opposite, right!?!?!?Despite having seen SHAWSHANK at least 15 times, it never ceases to mesmerize me. My only real critique: I think Andy would have to have been a magician to do what he did at the end, at least, so seamlessly...Can't go into any more detail without treading into SPOILER territory, so you'll just have to figure it out for yourself!

Why it is ranked so highly.,"Over the years many IMDb users have wondered why ""The Shawshank Redemption"" was ranked so high, and many ""wished"" that in time it would sink to a lower, more appropriate slot. Many analyses missed the mark. Following is my take on the real reason it is ranked so high, and why it will never sink much, if any. And I hope it never does.This film deals with several ""hot"" buttons in us. A cheating spouse. A husband wrongly convicted and sent to prison. Corrupt law enforcement. A prison where inmates get maimed or killed. A smart inmate who plots a brilliant escape. The corrupt warden getting his just reward. Two friends being re-united with a good life ahead of them. Combined with a good script and good cinematography. What's not to like about this story?I have seen this movie a number of times. Each time I get something new out of it that I either didn't see before, or had not made a mental connection to. I recently (year 2014) upgraded my personal copy from DVD to Blu-Ray and both the picture and sound are better.This film continues to spark the occasional argument of whether it really should be rated on IMDb as the top film of all time. I don't know exactly where ""Shawshank Redemption"" should rank on the all-time list. That is akin to comparing home run hitters or golfers from different centuries. The games are quite different, as is true in cinema. I gave this film a ""10"", and on my list it is in one of the best movies of all time, along with a number of others. At the same time, I recognize that everyone else has their own opinion. I don't really see any value in trying to decide a rank order for all time.

Now that I see it has the number two position, as voted by the movie-going public, on probably the most accurate best ever list in the world (AFI be damned), I am eminently pleased.  There is no way Forrest Gump should have won best picture over Shawshank.  Certainly, Forrest Gump is a charming, well-acted film, but it is nothing compared to this.

"Richly human, uplifting","Deservedly ranked at the top of IMDb's all-time best 250 films ever.The casting is superb: Morgan Freeman is ""Red,"" a wise observer of people and an entrepreneur inmate who's made ""connections"" so he can get contraband to other inmates for a price; he's under a life sentence for murder. Tim Robbins is ""Andy,"" a smart banker and accounting whiz who was sentenced to 2 life terms for killing his wife and her lover (which he--like most other inmates, say they're not guilty of). And Bob Gunton is ""Warden Norton"" who, when we first meet him, is touting the virtues of Bible reading and strict discipline. While, fortunately, I've had no first hand experience, ""Shawshank"" certainly gives the feel of authenticity of prison life and its society.A long movie, most of it takes place inside a semi-corrupt state penitentiary in the late 1940s. ""Red,"" in talking his thoughts out loud to himself, becomes our narrator for many developments. As the story unfolds, increasingly we come to see Andy as a person with strong personal values which he upholds in the most difficult situations. And in Andy's work for Warden Norton, we also increasingly find the warden as morally his opposite: selfish and fundamentally lacking decent moral character--all show and appearance and with no integrity, substance.In Roger Ebert's first review (of his two) of this movie, he said: ""....the film is an allegory about holding onto a sense of personal worth, despite everything....the word redemption is in the title for a reason....""

"The shortest long movie I've ever seen. Kept me wanting more and more, minute by minute.","At first, before starting the movie, I thought ""Sounds like a typical prison riot and break-out kind of movie"". At the beginning of the movie, my thoughts was even more convincing. A large prison (Which immediately reminded me of the movie ""The Last Castle"" from 2001), housing people of all sorts, having it's guards, warden and of course, the inmates. The typical inmate; Roughneck, hard on the outside, broken on the inside. And they all claim their innocence, as an internal joke sort of speak.It gets to a point where I started comparing it with others. That proved wrong in quite a short while, from the point where a prisoner, framed for murder of his wife and her lover, is being convicted and sentenced to life in prison. His name was Andy Dufresne. In short terms, a straight-up bank employee, excellent with numbers and taxes, which he also uses to benefit within the walls of the prison. His reputation as a numerological genius spreads out, and soon all kinds of people, inmates and guards, are coming to him for financial advice. He builds up a library, he maintains a strict surface. He has his hobbies, to keep his mind busy (as said in the movie). He carves chess pieces out of stone, using an axe as the tool. Seemingly, this is a nice and lucrative hobby, but underneath it all, he has a secret...The movie keeps the viewer thrilled and excited, because in every minute, something could happen. The dialog is good, Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman, both great actors, shows and outstanding play. The crew really did good work on the set, the right camera angles, the light, sounds and so on...it was almost like I could smell the prison!A brilliant movie. Not too short, not too long.

Being unhappy about that, I started watching the movie on the TV just by chance, not knowing about its existence before that at all. At first I was skeptic, I admit that.

I could hardly believe that a movie could make me feel that way - so excited, so happy about my life, leaving me believing so much in my own self. It is a great story of what the strength of your thoughts can make you do. In The Shawshank Redemption desire does not make you weak, just the opposite - gives you wings to fly away from fear, fly closer and closer to freedom. Morgan Freeman's voice is just another advantage that makes the movie even more impressive. Tim Robbins' act is just beyond perfection!

But these are not truly great actors and in any case, they are only asked to play appealing persons, deliberately less-dimensional than real (as opposed to believably hyper-real which is much harder).The director is a first-timer, and it shows. There is simple framing and staging here. In fact, there seems to be a deliberate strategy to be as plain as possible. And that is the core of where I think people find the appeal of this film.The story is very tight in the sense of narrative flow. All the chunks are the same size, with no fancy rhythm. There is no distracting backstory. No element has irony, not writing, acting, shooting, even the score.Now for me, I expect and demand art in my films -- that's why I register this as plain. But I think it is well liked because it is totally without pretense. It is straight and honest; people seem hungry for honesty, and this has the appearance of what they need at just the right time.Is a film great because it merely fulfills? I hope many people think not, and dream that this film moves down the list to be replaced with more intelligent efforts.",,Anonymous,Drama

Without a doubt one of the best movies of all time,"When I saw that the Shawshank Redemption was #1 on the top 250 movies of all time, I thought ""Yea, I could understand that"". I don't necessarily agree that it's absolutely the best, but it is so good that it makes sense that a forum of popular consensus for film rankings would rank it at the top.It is the story of Andy Dufresne, played by Tim Robbins and his time at Shawshank Prison. It is a perspective of what it is to be human and to have hope for the future even in the face of insurmountable adversity.It's funny, because I don't really think that any one particular thing stands out as spectacular. The performances are very good, but nothing really noteworthy. The characters all serve the story beautifully, but none of them really stand out from the others. Frank Darabont is great, the shots are exactly what they should be. Almost the entire film is shot at the prison, adding to the feeling of isolation and routine.And yet, we are captivated from the outset. Morgan Freeman could read a Sears catalogue and I'd pay to hear it, his narration breathes life into every scene that it's spoken over. The real beauty of this film is it's story, mostly about Andy and Red (Robbins and Freeman), but it's the way that each character contributes symbiotically to the development of the story that is the absolute mastery.Stephen King's novella ""Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption"" was the short story that was used as the basis for the film and it serves as evidence that King is not just a master of horror, but a true literary genius. Sure, he doesn't use as many fifty cent words as histories other great masters, but does anyone tell as good a story? King always gives his writing such distinct atmosphere and energy that you can't help but get swept away. The Shawshank Redemption is no different.If there is a film by which other films should be judged, this is as good as it can get. Powerful, engaging, visceral, despairing, a masterfully woven dialogue of what it means to be human. It's one of those journeys of the human spirit that just makes you feel happy to be alive.An amazing story translated beautifully to the screen. A masterpiece, 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama

The best film of all time ?,"I liked this film. That sums it up pretty well. This film is good, in some aspects very good, but the best film of all time? I usually don't say this, but I think The Shawshank Redemption is overrated. I don't want to take away from the performances, the story or the score, those were really good.

For the first time the Movie defeats the Book!,"As an omnivorous reader movies are always second to books to me. I believe....movie can never defeat the book because while reading book we use our own imagination....and movie narrows down the imagination.....it only allows us to see how the director has imagined the book.But Believe me...this is not the case of The Shawshank Redemption...which I rate as the best movie I have ever seen.For the first time in history the book(the Stephen King Novella) has been defeated by its movie version.After watching the movie I was crazy about reading the book....I thought wow!the movie is so good...how will be the book!!To tell U frankly,the book is good, but the movie is best.There are some unforgettable scenes in the movie which were not in the book.Some examples are: The scene when Andy locks up the guard and play the opera on the microphone.The narration goes on like..""I didn't understand a single word that Italian lady was singing...but I tell U..for that single second every soul in the Shawshank prison felt free...""The scene just fill my heart with Andy's yearn for freedom...I was kinda shocked when I didn't find it in the original book version.I can remember another scene.While Andy creates the prison library and starts listing books sent to prison from charity organizations...a fellow inmate tries to read a name on the book...Alexandre Dumas as ""Dumb-Ass"". Andy says....""its not Dumb-ass...its Dumas..and U may like the book..The Count of Monty Cristo...its about a jailbreak.And the category it falls is Fiction"" Then Red says..""Why don't we put it on Educational category?""(Right before Andy listed an engineering handbook as ""Educational"" category).As Count of Monticristo is one of my favorite books, I was hysteric watching this sophisticated joke.This was also not in the book.This DVD is my favorite gift I give my friends.

The best movie ever?,"Before watching Shawshank Redemption for the first time, I really didn't think much of it. I thought it had probably wrongfully earned the #1 spot here on IMDb, and couldn't be better than The Godfather for example. A movie that was ""cool"" to like, if you will. I could imagine fashion conscious movie-hipsters discussing movies over their glasses of Napa Valley Chardonnay, arguing who liked Shawshank Redemption the most, and which movie by Ingmar Bergman had the strongest metaphorical messages. You get the idea.I'm sure everything I have to say about the way the movie has been made has been said better in one of the other comments. That said, the reason I'm posting this review is because Shawshank Redemption isn't only a hardcore movie freak's wet dream. While it's brilliantly written, has some of the most fluent acting I have seen and shows the fantastic directing skills of Frank Darabont, you really don't have to be an expert of film theory to appreciate it. It appeals to so many different groups of people, and so many different human feelings at the same time. The ""weaknesses"" it had as it came out (the idea of a jail movie not being compatible with the female population, and the idea of a movie about lifelong friendship between two men not being compatible with the male population) is actually the reason Shawshank Redemption is loved by nearly all: It offers something for everyone.In my opinion rating something 10/10 is a bit too absolute for anything, but since this is probably the best movie I remember seeing, and my first 10/10, I think I'll let it slide this time.",,Anonymous,Drama
Escape from Shawshank,"It is the most basic of all principles of film-making: A story of redemption. This time the story is set inside Shawshank Prison, where successful banker Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) is sent to during the 40s, after being falsely accused of murdering his wife and her lover. The jail veteran, Red (Morgan Freeman), sees Andy being forced through the front gates of the jail on his first day of arrival and sees him as a weakling. Red even makes a bet with the fellow inmates that he won't last. He's wrong.Andy does last, and becomes an inspiration to all of those behind bars. The warden of the jail, Samuel Norton (Bob Gunton), is intent on bringing down Andy and his defiant nature, as all villains always are.That is the prevailing message, I suppose. The redemption comes two-fold -- Andy is given time to reflect upon his life in Shawshank, and Red (who is obviously deeply moved by Andy's influence) learns a thing or two, going through a cleansing process. We see the gradual change, too -- first Red is the cynical veteran, then the curious insider, then the close friend, then the surprised object of redemption. As strange a title it may be, ""The Shawshank Redemption"" is a worthy one.At the end of the day, ""Shawshank"" is a good film - but far from a perfect one. I'm not interested in responding to its Top 250 placement with my review (as countless others have done), but the fact that it has been voted into the number one slot is a reflection of how universal its appeal is: it's about as likable and mass-marketed as possible. There's nothing here to really offend or provoke and the film doesn't take enough changes to potentially polarize audiences -- it plays it safe, and in my opinion, a bit too safe. The film's message of hope and redemption is way too heavy-handed, the outcome being a movie that is very simple and easy to digest -- but not really very interesting beyond its surface. It speaks volumes that so many people who have gone through depression often reference this as one of the aids they used for comfort -- it's a movie that pats people on the back and gives them hope and inspiration.That's a great message, but if you provide it without any challenge to the audience -- and instead just spoon feed it -- well, for me, anyway, it doesn't leave much of an impact. It's just a well-made but manipulative and self-important film.",6.0,Anonymous,Drama
Too flawed,This movie is a total piece of manipulation. It does have a few redeeming features though - Morgan Freeman's narration all through is pure art!!! This guy acts with his mouth!!! As a piece of fiction it has some merit and I can see why many people would enjoy it. But to be classed as one of the best movies of all time - really? C'mon!!! Certainly the portrayal of the brutality of the guards during those times I would say is fairly realistic.The one part of the story where an old timer gets released does ring true. There are many people like that who are totally institutionalized and do not have the skill to survive on the outside without a good support network in place.This is a movie for those people who like everything laid out perfectly for them and doesn't require any thinking. Personally I like a bit more depth and reality.I don't want to put people off seeing it - it should be watched once. But for me the flaws outweigh its redeeming features.,3.0,Anonymous,Drama

"A melodramatic, motherf***ing masterpiece","In this review I'm not going to give a plot synopsis of this film because I'm sure everybody else who has commented on it has. However, I will express the positive effect it can have on the viewer if they let it.The acting is uncommonly magnificent. Morgan Freeman delivers the greatest performance of his brilliant career as the seasoned life-serving prisoner Ellis Boyd ""Red"" Redding, Tim Robbins holds his own against Freeman as Andy, the central character, James Whitmore's portrayal of the institutionalized Brooks provides the backbone of the story, Bob Gunton is wonderful as the corrupt Warden Norton, and Clancy Brown's commanding performance as Captain Hadley, the sadistic head prison guard, almost makes him steal the show from Freeman.Frank Darabont's restrained direction of the delicate story is critical for the film to not become sentimental or clichéd, and his beautiful adaptation of the Stephen King story on which the movie is based is a real breath of fresh air. On account of Darabont, the film shows that special effects are not needed to tell a great story in film. As a 17-year-old male, I love special effects movies as much as the next person, but they get boring after a while. Plus many people forget that there was a time in cinema when the blockbuster didn't exist, when they made movies that just told great stories and gave the audience a chance to be uplifted by those stories without the creators having to resort to special effects. I applaud you for having the guts to make a non-commercial film that reminds people of that in this day and age, Mr. Darabont.SPOILER ALERT!As with all truly great films, 'The Shawshank Redemption' is full of scenes that have become entrenched in the public's collective consciousness. There's the scene where Andy plays the opera record over the loudspeaker for all the inmates in the prison, Captain Hadley bashing ""Fat @$$"" to death for crying during his first night in prison (a very powerful scene), Red giving his ""Rehabilitated?"" speech to the board of parole officials, the Warden getting his final judgement, and of course, Andy crawling to freedom through what Red in his narration calls ""500 yards of s**t-smelling foulness I can't even imagine,"", the scene which for me is perhaps the greatest movie scene of the '90s.END OF SPOILERS!I thoroughly recommend this cinematic masterpiece, which has earned its place in my humble top ten films of all time list, to anybody. Whatever gender, age, religion, nationality etc. you are and whatever language you speak, I guarantee it will change your life, or perhaps even save it. Movies like 'The Shawshank Redemption' only come along once every decade, if that. Unforgettable.10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama

A Sort of Secular Redemption,"The story of this film takes place over a twenty-year period between 1947 and 1967. Andy Dufresne, a young banker from Portland, Maine, is wrongly convicted of murdering his wife and her lover, and sentenced to life imprisonment. (""Shawshank"" is the name of the prison where he serves his sentence). The prison is a brutal place, and Andy is frequently beaten and sexually assaulted by a gang of homosexual inmates called ""The Sisters"". Two things, however, help him to survive. One is his friendship with another convict, Red, who has a reputation for being able to acquire almost any item and, for a price, to smuggle it into the prison. The other is his financial expertise, which he puts to good use, becoming a tax and financial adviser to the prison guards and even the Warden himself. As a reward for these services, Andy is given a privileged job in the prison library and protection from molestation. To avenge their attacks on Andy, the leader of the ""Sisters"" is so badly beaten by the guards that he is crippled for life; Andy is not molested again.The Warden devises a scheme under which inmates are put to work on local construction projects. The purpose of this is ostensibly to prepare them for life after they are released, but in reality he is exploiting their free labour for his own personal profit, and using Andy's financial skills to launder the proceeds. This arrangement seems to work to Andy's advantage, because of the extra privileges he is granted, but things change when a new young prisoner named Tommy Williams is sent to Shawshank. Tommy has evidence that could secure Andy's release; a former cellmate in another prison has confessed to him that he committed the murders for which Andy was convicted. Tommy confides this secret to the Warden who, fearing that his illegal schemes will be revealed should Andy ever be released, arranges to have Tommy murdered by a corrupt guard.There is a long history of American prison films, including the likes of ""I am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang"", ""Cool Hand Luke"", ""Brubaker"" and the more recent ""The Last Castle"". (Frank Darabont was later to direct another prison film, ""The Green Mile"", based, like ""The Shawshank Redemption"" on a Stephen King story). Most of these were made with a liberal social agenda in mind, aiming to expose the harsh prison conditions and thereby inspire their reform. ""The Shawshank Redemption"" falls, to some extent, within this tradition; it is made from a basically liberal viewpoint and vividly depicts the brutality of prison life, although the fact that it is a period piece, set several decades in the past, might suggest that social issues were not the filmmakers' sole concern. Perhaps more important are the analysis of the nature of freedom and of the relationship between Andy and Red.The word ""prison"", from the French ""pris"" (""taken""), merely indicates a place where captives are held, and the authorities, especially in America, prefer to describe many prisons by some more positive term such as ""penitentiary"" or ""reformatory"" which implies their purpose of rehabilitating criminals. Shawshank, a prison where the Warden and guards are at least as crooked as the inmates, has precisely the opposite effect. Andy goes in innocent of any crime and comes out guilty of being an accessory to corruption and fraud. Yet, despite his involvement in the Warden's dishonesty, Andy retains a certain integrity; he refuses to give up hope and refuses to allow himself to be beaten by the system. Although he is in prison he has found a sort of freedom. A key moment comes when he defies the guards to play a Mozart aria over the prison loudspeakers for all the inmates to hear- a reminder of spiritual values even in the harshest of environments.Red faces a different problem. He fears that he has become so institutionalised that he will be unable to survive freedom, as happened to another long-term prisoner who committed suicide shortly after his release. In prison, his role as the ""fixer"" who can obtain anything, be it a packet of cigarettes, a rock hammer or a poster of Rita Hayworth, makes him the king of the inmates. (These latter two items will play an important role in the plot). On the outside he will be just another ex-con trying to make ends meet in a dead-end job. Paradoxically, he is more free in jail than he will be on the outside. I won't give away the ending, but it involves Andy repaying Red's previous kindnesses by showing him how he can be free in all senses of the word.The film was not a great box office success when first released but has since acquired a status as one of the classics of the modern American cinema; it has now supplanted ""The Godfather"" as number one on IMDb's Top 250 list. The film would perhaps not be number one on my personal list, but it is a fine one and would certainly be in my top 250, perhaps the top 100. Its two stars, Tim Robbins as Andy and Morgan Freeman as Red, are both excellent. Its initial lack of success may have had something to do with its rather clumsy title. ""Shawshank"" is not a word that will mean anything to the average person (according to one story Darabont was once asked how his ""rickshaw"" film was going) and ""redemption"", except in technical legal contexts, normally has a religious connotation. This is not an explicitly religious film; indeed, in its portrayal of Warden Norton as a sanctimonious, Bible-bashing hypocrite, it can be seen as critical of religion. Nevertheless, the word ""redemption"" is perhaps appropriate in this context, after undergoing the hell of Shawshank Andy and Red manage to find a sort of secular redemption. It may be this message of hope that accounts for the film's continuing popularity. 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,Drama

An average film that does not bear repeated viewing,"Ok, so this isn't exactly a bad film, but it's extremely hard to see why it holds the no.2 position in the top 250 films. The acting is fine, the twist is gratifying (if a little predictable) and some of the shots are fantastic. However, the film is let down by unrealistic dialogue, especially on the part of Freeman's character, who does not seem able to construct a sentence without using a string of metaphors and similes.The prison warder is a one-dimensional villain with very little allure - we, the viewers, are not credited with much intelligence. Because he is a villain, it therefore follows that he must a be a Nazi, no? Cue references to book-burning etc. Furthermore, the portrayal of Tim Robbins' character as Christ is slightly offensive (check out the shot in which he is shown with his arms thrown up to heaven).In true Hollywood style, there seems to be about five 'endings' - when we think that the excitement (or otherwise) is over, another sequence is tagged onto the end. Despite some fairly violent scenes, life inside Shawshank seems actually rather appealing - a library, plenty of time outside the cells. This, combined with the film's massive length, means that for my mind, The Shawshank Redemption merits only a 6/10.",6.0,Anonymous,Drama

Triumph of the Human Spirit,"The Shawshank Redemption is often hailed as a cinematic masterpiece-and for good reason. Adapted from Stephen King's novella Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption, the film weaves an extraordinary tale of hope, perseverance, and friendship, transcending the confines of its prison setting to touch the very essence of the human spirit. It is not merely a film; it is an enduring piece of art that resonates with universal themes, offering inspiration and motivation to audiences worldwide.A Journey of Redemption:
The story revolves around Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), a banker wrongfully convicted of murdering his wife and her lover, and sentenced to life in Shawshank State Penitentiary. In prison, Andy befriends Ellis ""Red"" Redding (Morgan Freeman), a seasoned inmate known for his ability to procure contraband. Over the course of two decades, Andy's quiet resilience, intellect, and unyielding hope transform not only his life but the lives of those around him.Performances: A Showcase of Talent
Tim Robbins delivers a career-defining performance as Andy Dufresne, embodying quiet strength and unrelenting optimism. Morgan Freeman's portrayal of Red is nothing short of iconic; his warm, introspective narration lends the film its soul. The chemistry between Robbins and Freeman is electric, making their friendship the emotional core of the film.The supporting cast, including Bob Gunton as the corrupt warden Norton and Clancy Brown as the brutal Captain Hadley, adds depth to the story, creating a vivid tapestry of life within Shawshank.Themes: Hope as a Beacon
At its heart, The Shawshank Redemption is a story about hope-its power to sustain, transform, and ultimately liberate. Andy's unwavering belief in a better future, symbolized by his escape and the iconic poster of Rita Hayworth, serves as a reminder that the human spirit can overcome even the darkest circumstances.The film also explores themes of friendship, justice, and institutionalization. Red's journey from a man resigned to his fate to one who dares to hope mirrors the transformative power of Andy's optimism.Technical Brilliance:
Roger Deakins' cinematography is another highlight of the film. From the claustrophobic interiors of the prison to the breathtaking final scene on the shores of Zihuatanejo, Deakins captures both the despair and beauty of Andy's journey. Thomas Newman's hauntingly beautiful score complements the visuals, evoking a spectrum of emotions-from sorrow to triumph.Conclusion: A Testament to Cinema's Potential
The Shawshank Redemption is more than just a film-it is an experience, a meditation on life's struggles and the power of the human spirit. It reminds us that redemption is always within reach, and that even in the bleakest circumstances, hope can shine as a guiding light.This timeless classic reaffirms the transformative power of cinema, making it a must-watch for anyone seeking inspiration, motivation, or simply the joy of witnessing a perfect piece of storytelling.""Hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things, and no good thing ever dies.""

The greatest movie ever!,"The Shawshank Redemption is easily my favorite movie of all time. It has every single element that should be looked for in a film. A brilliant script (with the best dialogue ever written), a perfect cast (not one bad performance), and not to mention an original, complex and ultimately uplifting story.Based on the Stephen King novel, Shawshank Redemption is a delight from first scene to last. The opening is a brilliantly done sequence with Andy's (Tim Robbins) trial intercut with his actions on the night of his crime. This leads to him being taken to Shawshank with one of the best shots ever captured on film, with the camera sweeping from behind the prison bus in the air and diving into the middle of the prison yard. There Andy meets Red (Morgan Freeman) and others, and a gradual friendship begins to develop.This movie has that certain indefinable screen magic, every line of dialogue spoken has real conviction and meaning, and the performances in this movie are nothing short of magnificent. Tim Robbins delivers his best screen performance ever, as the quietly spoken Andy. Here is a character like no other, so vivid, so real, that you can't help but like him. Morgan Freeman also delivers his best work ever as Red, Andy's friend. Freeman, while playing a different character from Robbins, is also able to give off a quiet dignity for his character.The supporting cast is perfect. From Bob Gunton, chillingly evil, but never over the top as to become cartoonish, as the Warden. Clancy Brown, as the prison Guard Hadley is brilliant, as is Veteran James Whitmore, as Brooks, who while given relatively small screen time is brilliant as the lifer con who's sad journey the film details.There is not a dull moment or poor line of dialogue in this film. Credit first time director Frank Darabont for this remarkable piece of work. He is a director of the future. I still can't believe this was his first movie!, he will find it hard to top this masterful film. Special mention must be made of the music score by Thomas Newman, who has composed a simple, but perfect score for this film. His scoring of the scene with Andy and Red sitting up against the wall discussing their plans for release is nothing short of brilliant, as is the rest of his score.I encourage everyone who has not seen this to grab it now, as it is surely not only the best movie of the 90's but the best movie of all time.***** out of *****",,Anonymous,Drama
Overrated sappy drama,"Little more than average drama for popular tastes. Predictable,  overly sentimental, and excessively long.It's a mystery to me that such a mediocre piece of cinematic art is at number 2 in the all time chart! However, predictably it's not in the top 100 more serious 'Sight and Sound'  critics and directors polls that are held every  ten years. Frank Darabont later proved to be no master with his two following films, the second rate 'The Green Mile' and the truly appalling 'The Majestic'. The fact that this pedestrian movie is, in this chart, ahead of the works of  real masters such as Kubrick, Welles, Kurosawa, Fellini and Hitchcock causes consternation.",6.0,Anonymous,Drama
Over rated,"The Shawshank Redemption is with out a doubt one of the most over rated films of the 90s.  There have been many intriguing prison movies over the years, Shawshank is not one of them. Instead it's sentimental slop served to uplift the souls of the American people.  There is never any sense in the film that Tim Robbin's character is in true danger.  If the film wanted to show the true horror of prison maybe it should of been far more darker, instead of inspiration. Morgan Freeman is wasted as usual, in the role of wisdom spouting inmate. Freeman's character is mainly there to look wise and bring inspiration to us all, but he is never treated as a typical person. Tim Robbins is good, but his character is all good, while the prison warden is sure evil. Everything is black and white.  Shawshank has potential to be great, but director Frank Darabant's obsession with being Frank Capra ruins the film at every turn.",5.0,Anonymous,Drama
Now here is a classic,"This suspense filled, dramatic movie rides high on the plain of self discovery, self worth and self preservation; if an innocent man is locked up for two decades with criminals, nothing else will he learn than to be a criminal himself. There is no better movie that I can recommend you to see than this classic Jail Break that stared one of the best supporting actors you will love to have on your side if you are in the lead role of a movie, Morgan Freeman.Shawshank Redemption was adapted from a Stephen King novella named Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption. Frank Darabont secured the right to make the film from King in 1987, and he worked intensively on the screenplay for a proper adaptation of the movie, Darabont's screenplay writing earned him an Academy Award nomination, in fact the movie had seven Academy Award nominations and won none.The film tells the story of Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) who is a banker who got convicted for murdering his wife and her lover; he got two consecutive life sentences at Shawshank State Penitentiary. At Shawshank Andy befriends a fellow inmate, Ellis Boyd ""Red"" Redding (Morgan Freeman) Red was a contraband smuggler.Andy also developed a nice rapport with the warden and the other guards helping them with their taxes and also helping the warden in his money laundering operation.The movie boast of amazing scenery not to add an impressive cinematography, the movie growth and inclusion and exit of characters will make you feel like you are reading a book, the movie has numerous cast, and it is broken into segments each introducing new casts and each building a parallel wall that guides us to the climatic end.It didn't do well in the box office at all barely making back its production cost, but due to critic's high rating and Academy Award nomination, Golden Globe award nomination and other notable nominations, the movie did well in rental and DVD sales, it is shown regularly on Cable TV, and it has a high following.Frank Darabont who is the director and screenplay writer also made more of King's books; He directed the 1999 Tom Hanks movie The Green Mile which was a box office success compared to this. The Green Mile is another of King's books that is about a prison, and Darabont also directed the 2007 movie The Mist which is also based on a Stephen King book.Here is a DVD every home should have.www.lagsreviews.com",9.0,Anonymous,Drama

Now the only questions I have to ask are:  Why didn't EVERYBODY go to see this movie?  and, Why didn't Morgan Freeman win the Oscar?  Tom Hanks is a fine actor but, he should never have beaten Morgan.  Once again a Stephen King short story translates to film better than his horror opus'.  Tim Robbins pulls out his finest performance to date, and, Mr Darabont take a bow.

"A bit overrated, but still an amazing film","It's times like these that almost tempt me to grab Jigsaw off the shelf. It's been almost a month since I saw a film that was flatout bad; the worst review I've given in weeks was a 6/10 to Flightplan. This film obviously didn't break my streak.I went into it knowing next to nothing, only that IMDb has it ranked as the second best movie of all time, that it was based on a story by Stephen King, and that it took place in a prison. Needless to say, it blew me away. I wont say a thing about the plot, just so that others who've yet to see this film have a chance at the same experience as me. I will say this though: It has some of the most subtle and unexpected twists you will ever see. One in particular stands out above the rest.Not much can be said about the actors that hasn't been said. Morgan Freeman gives one of the best performances of his career, and even though I've only seen 2 or 3 other Tim Robbins movies, I'm sure the same can be said for him.Though I don't agree with the multitudes of people that call this the best movie ever made, it was still a very good, very well made, very entertaining and almost heartbreaking film.9/10",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
What a touching movie !,"It is really amazing movie i have ever seen in my lifetime. The cast and the story of the movie are really successful. Andy is a passionate character, and he is convicted of murdering his wife and her lover despite his claims of innocence. It is so touching to spend almost two decades in the prison. Old-fashioned prisons in the 90s are full of bad guy who don't expect anything from the life. And , they don't think how we escape here. However; Andy with his close friend in the prison , Red , tries redemption from this prison, by the time , Andy tries to do beneficial things for people in the prison not to attract attention. It is unbelievable that they escape from this prison. But , Andy approaches to place of exit. It is actually amazing , it is really incredible. They go to their dreams to live a peaceful and quiet life. Also; Andy prepares a trap for the chief of the jail. After the redemption , they become free anymore. It is really an amazing movie. Easily one of the best movies made during the 90s and definitely one of the top 'prison' movies of all-time. Pretty much everything about this movie works and works extremely well!",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Good but ludicrously overrated,"I quite like this film but it wouldn't make my top 100. The idea it's the greatest film in history is laughable.Of course the acting's terrific. Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins are solid as ever, even if Bob Gunton and Clancy Brown (the Baddies) chew the scenery. And that's the problem - everything is so terribly black and white, with every character springing straight out of a three word summary. Our hero is Good But Flawed, Red is Good And Noble, the Warden is Just Plain Bad and his henchman is Reminiscent Of Another Film (okay, four words).I've never been inside a prison, but I can't believe all the prisoners would be so damn nice. There's the ""sisters"" - a bunch of horrid rapists, of course, but they're nothing a small plot contrivance can't eliminate. The ""sisters"" aside, there's nary a cross word from a prisoner in the whole film.Racism is also curiously absent. American prisons today are notorious hot-beds of racism. Martin Luther King's dream is bizarrely alive and well in Shawshank, where colour doesn't get a mention in twenty years of ""history"".This total lack of realism means it's not really a film about prison at all. And what kind of ""character"" film can be centred around someone who seems entirely flawless (other than perhaps in his choice of attorney).I can whinge about the mechanics of the film as well. Voiceover narration is irritating enough - but Red narrating events at which he was not present? Pur-lease. And that final scene - talk about a director who didn't know when to shout ""cut"". It didn't need much self control to stop at the point Red heads towards Mexico - films for grown-ups shouldn't need endings that resolve any uncertainty.Speaking of the director, isn't it odd how the maker of the ""Greatest film in the world ever"" is also credited for The Fan, Eraser, The Blob and The Fly II? It's as if Orson Welles directed ""Plan 9 from Outer Space"", or Francis Ford Copolla helmed ""Megaforce"".I don't mean to make this out to be a bad film - it's far from that. But anyone who rates it the greatest ever should try ""Godfather"", ""Goodfellas"", ""Citizen Kane"", ""Casablanca"" - something, anything that's not so *worthy*.",6.0,Anonymous,Drama

Not that much good to get the rank 1,"After ten years, I watched this movie again. I wanted to see whether my thoughts will change or not, because ten years ago I did not understand why this movie is at the top. Still, I think it should not be even in top 50 movies, because nothing is special. Years are passing just like a moment, I could not feel his pain or hope. In one scene, he wants something than bum it is happening. Again, for one scene his situation is so bad, than guess what happens? After just 30 seconds, he is good. So you never go top or down during this movie. My suggestion is it is better to watch this movie without the number 1 expectations.

Now Morgan Freeman's got talent, I love that guy he may not be the greatest out there but he is a force to be reckoned with on the set. I loved how he gave the story flavor with his descriptions of characters and perceptions of how life was in lonely jail cells of Shawshank. You know there's a lot more to say about this movie, it's too good too be true. Especially the ending which by the way brought tears to eyes, the most moving scene!!!

No spoilers here - just a comment on a movie that can still move you to tears even after multiple viewings. Morgan Freeman delivers the performance of a lifetime. Everything else comes together in perfect harmony. This movie came out the same year as Forrest Gump which won the Oscar for best picture - Forrest Gump is a great picture but this one really deserved the ""cake"". Tim Robbins is AMAZING as Andy, and he supported brilliantly by a cast that one could only hope to see assembled again.

Awesome movie - The Shawshank Redemption (1994),"It's very rare that you find such diversity in a movie now days. I like the story and it's concept.A thumping good ode to friendship, hope, wit, wiles and wisdom, brimming with crackling characters and topped with the most twister of twists since ""The Crying Game."" The Shawshank Redemption is a powerful and uplifting, not to mention Oscar-worthy film. In 2006, it was ranked as the greatest film ever by Empire, a film magazine. The year it came out it was nominated for 7 academy awards but did not win a single one because of a movie you may all remember, Forrest Gump. It's the no-bull performances that hold back the flood of banalities. Robbins and Freeman connect with the bruised souls of Andy and Red to create something undeniably powerful and moving. Some of ""The Shawshank Redemption'' comes across as outrageously improbable. Yet the film keeps pulling you back with its sense of striving humanity slowly turning the tables against evil.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Freeman gives it depth,"Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) is a banker convicted of murdering his wife and her lover. He always professes his innocence, but is thrown into Shawshank Prison with other lifers like Red (Morgan Freeman).Director Frank Darabont has made a prison fable out of a Stephen King short story. It is well acted by Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman. Freeman is especially important as he is the narrator and the POV of the story. It's his lyrical voice that makes this fable compelling. It could have easily been a simple prison movie that rang hollow. Freeman gave the readings depth.If there is one complaint, it is Andy's claim of innocence. It needs to be shown early on during the trial. Instead, we derived mostly from Andy's demeanor. It needs to be a big declaration at the beginning. When Tommy (Gil Bellows) tells the story, he should include one detail from the trial like the 8 bullets. That way, the audience can get an aha moment. It's a minor point, and overall this is a good prison fable.",8.0,Anonymous,Drama
"If other people would rave about it less, I'd rave about it more","The redeeming feature of this film is that it was made in innocence. Darabont had no idea he was making anything profound.  And he wasn't.  This is a film about a prisoner who ... well, I can't give away the plot, for it's much better to come to the screen in ignorance; but anyone who thinks that this is a story about how Andy `finds out the truth about himself', or is in any way `redeemed', is grasping at straws.  These elements play so little role in the overall structure that we might as well ignore them.I have a theory: so many people have told Darabont that `The Shawshank Redemption' was a profound life-changing experience that he believed them, and then SET OUT to make another `profound, life changing experience' with `The Green Mile', with predictably ghastly results.  I haven't seen `The Green Mile' yet, so I can't be sure.Don't get me wrong.  A great movie needn't be profound, and the film which I think is the best ever made isn't profound, either - it contains no comment at all on the Nature of Human Existence or anything of that kind.  Still, `The Shawshank Redemption' isn't even great.  It's a very good story very well told.  Lucky we get such nice photography, rather than having to put up with Stephen King's prose every step of the way ...  Also, Tim Robbins has the lead role.  (Lucky, again, that it wasn't Tom Hanks - now THERE'S a frightening thought.)  Nobody can do the bewildered but intelligent innocent so well as he can.

One of the best - of all time. Seriously.,"If there was such a thing as a perfect movie, this is it. Of course, for practical reasons, one cannot award a film ten stars out of ten, because of the endless stream of new work demanding scrutiny. I'd like also to start by quoting another well known film, which sums up my opinion nicely. 'In many ways, the work of a critic is easy- we risk very little, and thrive on negative criticism, which is amusing to write and to read. But the harsh truth of the matter is that the average piece of junk is probably more valuable than our criticism designating it so'. This could not be closer to the truth. When it comes down to the wire, critics risk everything in dishing out praise, for fear of being ridiculed themselves.There can be no such danger with The Shawshank Redemption. It is an eternal masterpiece, timeless and inspiring. I avoid being clichéd, when it is at all possible to do so, but The Shawshank Redemption is beautiful, masterfully acted, with just that right amount of tenderness. This is a tale of moral courage, and the everlasting fight for justice. As with other films of the genre, one can tell what will happen, of course, but when you watch this film, you will time and again be genuinely surprised, and maybe even shed a tear for the persistence and unquenchable thirst of the human spirit. One leaps for joy after watching this incredible film, at the knowledge that evil, in all senses of the word, can, and will never triumph.Turning an eye to the technical side of things, just for a moment, I can discern not one single badly executed shot. The Shawshank Redemption is well written, and, as I have said before, brilliantly acted. Characters that could be flat are all allowed to develop and flourish, and the film is even better for it. The film grabs our attention, right from the word go, with agitated shots of Andy looking like he IS going to kill his wife. And the soundtrack. Well, there isn't much to say; except that most of the music in this film is some of the most beautiful I have ever heard.This is a deeply satisfying, wonderful, brilliant, fantastic, soulful cinematic work. Watch it, if you haven't seen it, and if you have, you must agree that this excellent film will be an eternal classic.

The only time I'd call anything The Best Film Ever Made.,"This is it, I have always been so careful on not getting carried away while watching great films and calling it the best. I am talking about the league of The Godfather, Casablanca, The Good The Bad & The Ugly and 12 Angry Men. So I always called each of them one of the best. I never believed THE BEST ever existed. It can't be, right? How can anything be the best or perfect. Definitely not perfect film. There's got to be something wrong somewhere I just need to look close enough.But I was wrong. Although I knew I was all the way. Right from the very first time I watched The Shawshank Redemption on HBO in 1997 (18 years ago) and I waited 18 years, 5 thorough viewings, 1 sceptical review before I wrote my final judgment of this film.This is the best film ever made. Spotless. True classic. And it was not even directed or acted by the legends we know today. Sure they are true legends. But what Frank Dorabont, Tim Robbins, Morgan Freeman & their amazing crew did is something extra special. They created the best work on cinema ever with almost none of those legends working on them.This film needs no further description. Ten out of ten in every department of film making. Full of incredible moments. Beauty, class and intellect in almost every scene. You do not need to know the No.1 film status on IMDb for over a decade to actually believe in the power of this genius work of art. This is the best, if there is one. This is the film that reaffirmed my faith in hope, human perseverance and friendship. I'm sure there are many who believe this isn't that great, but I am glad I think otherwise - and believe me, its a great feeling.

Once in a lifetime movie,"An excellent movie that can surely move you a bit. It throws open the question that can we really have prisons which are redemption centers in the true sense. At the same time, it redefines the word criminal. Are the heinous acts committed by administrative authorities justifiable by any means. There should be a code of conduct for the authorities and a HOLY PRISON MAINTENANCE BIBLE if any reformation has to take place. The movie goes through several touching incidents and may bore you a bit if you rarely sees serious touching movies and are fans of slick sci-fi thrillers moving at extraordinary pace like Matrix etc. However the exceptional acting by lead stars particularly by Morgan Freeman and the picking up of the tempo in the second half will leave you gasping for more. After Citizen Kane, Casablanca & Godfather, it is another classic that will stay in the echelons of the movie rating lists for long. There are a few weak points though.

Just a pity it didn't garner any Oscars, losing out, in the most part, to a far inferior movie, Forrest Gump.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
"Incredibly moving, funny and haunting","Where to begin on how to comment on one of the most beautiful, haunting, tragic yet slightly comical films in creation? This film is absolutely groundbreaking and deserves its place amongst all the greats of Cinema History. Complete with an amazing cast, a wonderful soundtrack and a storyline that will leave you mesmerised for years after your first viewing, this film is truly incredible.The film focuses on a man called Andy Dufresne, an intelligent banker who is accused of murdering his wife and her lover, and is consequentially sentenced to two life sentences in Shawshank Prison. Andy soon befriends a man named Red, a man imprisoned for murder, and runs an underground syndicate to help his friends get a hold of things from outside prison.Andy manages to help the guards of Shawshank Prison with their personal financial problems using his knowledge as a Banker, and an unlikely 'friendship' emerges, and soon Prison life doesn't seem so bleak for Andy. As Andy's journey through his life sentence grows, so does his friendship with Red, and he soon discovers what effects the walls of Shawshank have on the people in the prison after a series of unexpected and tragic events.Andy's personality soon earns him new friends as he begins to change people, fundamentally, without knowing how, as he spreads new lessons, both comically and psychologically, and soon Andy turns into a much more intelligent man than we may have realised him to be at first.As time goes on, Andy resolves to make Shawshank Prison friendlier and he works relentlessly to improve life for the prisoners and for the guards. But, as he continues to work hard for the good of others, he begins to learn the shocking truths of what the true colours of the guards and the Warden of Shawshank are. Revelations all come to the fore when Andy discovers some information which may prove him to be the innocent guy he has always claimed to be, and Andy's life takes a serious turn, and the consequences are dire for everybody as Andy's decisions become more and more unpredictable.Based on a short book by Stephen King, this film has hardly any faults at all, and is full of beauty, tragedy and comedy, and has a haunting presence as Morgan Freeman gives what is possibly the best performance he has ever given, and Tim Robbins excels as the tormented Andy. But, what makes this film go down in history isn't just the amazing script and the wonderful acting, but the film contains one of the most beautiful Soundtracks I have ever known, written by Thomas Newman. Many of the tunes are simplistic, yet very memorable, and they all perfectly reflect the dilemmas and situations the characters of the film find themselves in.This film is not afraid to shock people with its subtle shifts in the personalities of characters, and how a situation of comedy and hope may suddenly change to a tragedy beyond what you may have originally expected. This film is a true classic. This is a work of art which is endlessly re-experiencable with painful pleasure.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
I thought I'd discovered this movie,"I'd never heard of ""The Shawshank Redemption"" when I tuned in to it about 15 minutes in on one of my satellite channels, sometime around 1997 or so.It mesmerized me, and the last 20 minutes astounded me. The twists, the musical score, the final scene. Amazing.I recall doing some searches (in those pre-Google days, probably with Alta Vista) to find out if anyone else had ever heard of this film. I found out that they had. It turns out a whole lot of people discovered this film as a ""sleeper,"" on DVD or cable or satellite.My favorite movies of around that time, seen in theaters, had been ""Pulp Fiction"" and ""Heat."" I didn't see ""Forrest Gump"" until around 2000 or so, and didn't care for it much. A good year for films.Given the comments in the past half year or so (that I've gone back through), I suppose ""Shawshank"" will fall below some other films. There seems to be a a trend toward making ""Hey, it's not all that!"" (That is, it's not all that good, it's lousy, it's overrated, etc.)Whatever, it's a great film. And when I happened to see it late one night on my satellite system, I thought I was the first to realize how great it was. It took several years for me to spot the high ratings on IMDb and to read that it had become a cult classic favorite.(Ditto for ""The Big Lebowski,"" which for a while I thought I was the only fan of. Now it's a subject of festivals and midnight watchings, sort of like ""Rocky Horror"" once was. I saw ""Rocky Horror"" in 1976 at the World Science Fiction Convention in Kansas City and thought it was not very entertaining.)For me, the last 20-30 minutes is just the best. One twist after another, all seamlessly done. And a compelling musical score. Unforgettable.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
One of my TOP TEN,"I saw (once again) last night ""Shawshank Redemption"". If I have seen it once, I have seen it fifty times and never does it ever get tiring to me. Stephen King wrote a story which becomes one of the great classic movies of all time.""Shawshank"" is a story of a wronged man who overcomes the injustices of life, love and prison to remain the true person he always was. Andy, although a solitary and enigmatic person, finds himself through an injustice which throws him into a quagmire of human refuse. In this refuse he finds a few pieces of humanity which lets him know there is hope. Red is one of those humans. Upon realizing that he is about to fall into the hell of prison obscurity, Andy releases himself and escapes from the injustice of his current ""human"" existence. I use the word EXISTENCE for the whole movie is a work of existential survival.This is a movie that NO ONE should miss.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Superb prison buddy story - but sadly unimportant film,"If you simply see this as a straightforward storytelling prison film, then it is excellent (10/10) because it truly gets you involved in its main character. It is an extremely enjoyable and compelling experience with a heartfelt and well-acted buddy-story at its core. It delicately--and sometimes brutally--juxtaposes Andy Dufresne's (Tim Robbins) good-natured character with the harshness of prison life, projecting so much heart in doing so.However delightful as it is, The Shawshank Redemption has no allegories and no statements to make and it brought nothing new to cinema in either style or substance. It had no revolutionary ideas or approaches - it's only a very safe buddy-story. A damn good one, but still just that. So it can impossibly be a film that will be remembered or studied, because what will it be remembered for? Friendship? Huh, neat. I therefore don't think it's entirely deserving of being considered the #2 greatest film of all time on IMDb.com.But moving on and looking past that, it is possibly one of my all-time favourite films for the feelings it leaves. Sure, it often jerks you for tears just a bit too purposely, but this is forgivable because emotion is crucial to a prison story. On top of that, it never falls prey to predictable sappiness - probably because of its content which is devoid of sentimental romance and instead fills you up with a tragic friendship. It is so well-sewn together by a feel-good narrative by Morgon Freeman that it is impossible not to enjoy this film.9/10",9.0,Anonymous,Drama

Shamelessly uplifting; a heartfelt classic,"It was the film that never seemed to have a break cut out for it. Adapted from a Steven King short story (usually a sure sign of success), yet a disappointment at the box office. Nominated for seven Oscars, yet emerging with no wins. But, hope sprung eternal, and, as life began to imitate art, like its central characters, the film The Shawshank Redemption overcame such initial adversity to become one of the most revered and cherished films of all time.Director/screenwriter Frank Darabont, working from Steven King's short story 'Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption' brings the tale to life in a superbly powerful and emotionally flooring fashion. Darabont's script executes the incredibly difficult task of speaking directly to the human spirit, with its tale of passion and dedication overcoming captivity and adversity. Few modern films are bold enough to tackle such shamelessly inspirational themes as Shawshank's without coming across as painfully clichéd, but Darabont's airtight script, chock full of timeless lines, and steady, careful directing are enough to raise the film above such concerns, instead marking a film of which the emotional magnitude is seldom paralleled. From Roger Deakins' sweeping, operatic cinematography, to Thomas Newman's truly beautiful and inspiring musical score, to the dank, gritty realism of Shawshank prison itself, the film's consistent quality on all fronts is truly stunning.It is easy to see a story such as this easily falling flat with an inferior cast taking on the material, but Darabont's incredibly gifted and memorable cast is truly up to the challenge, taking a wonderful story and making it truly timeless. Tim Robbins truly brings unconventional convict Andy Dufresne to life, never without a passionate twinkle in his eye, even in his most beaten down and hopeless of scenes. Rather than typical leading man grandstanding, Robbins is wise enough to remain subtle and detached throughout, making the role all the more mysterious and endearing as a result. The inspired casting of Morgan Freeman as fellow inmate 'Red' resulted not only in a series of sumptuous voiceovers by one of the most melodious voices in Hollywood, but also in a genuinely heartwarming supporting character, with Freeman building a career of playing similar 'wise mentor figures' off his performance. The supporting cast being comprised mainly of relative unknowns strengthens the believability of their characters, leading the audience to see them as their character and not as the star behind the role. Bob Gunton is chillingly effective as the hate-inspiring prison warden, infusing more menace into his reedy voice and deadpan stare than any scenery chewing antagonist could capture. Character actor Clancy Brown also crafts another simple but effective antagonistic role as the captain of the guards. Gil Bellows is a strong presence as a rebellious inmate, and James Whitmore is charming and lovable as aged prison librarian Brooks.Overall, The Shawshank Redemption is an astonishing accomplishment, addressing shamelessly uplifting themes in a fashion which is sentimental, but never sappy, larger than life, but never melodramatic. In many ways the film feels like a throwback to the days of classic cinema where directors strove to make films which made their audiences happy, but Darabont easily dodges contemporary scorn by unabashedly and honestly pitching the film towards the human spirit, and firmly establishing it as a timeless classic with its impeccable package of flooring technical work, screen writing and acting. Far from being a simple ""prison drama"", the sheer emotional voyage of The Shawshank Redemption is enough to drain any viewer, both crushing their spirits then euphorically raising them in a truly peerless fashion. While Red may declare hope to be a dangerous thing, it's Darabont's fearless tackling of the tricky subject which really sets Shawshank free.-10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
I may be in the minority here but.......,"I have literally just turned off the DVD player after watching this film for the very first (and last) time after so much hype I thought it was about time. I sat all the way through it and did enjoy it, but I really don't see what all the fuss is about. Yes it is a good film, yes it is a good plot. However I had guessed the outcome and a few bits within the film before the flashback at the end, and therefore for me there were no unexpected twists. I wasn't even moved at the end. In fact all in all I was a bit disappointed, as my friends who have seen it said that they had cried and it was such a brilliant film. Am I abnormal????????

Help me!,"What's going on here? At the moment I am writing these words The Shawshank Redemption is 3rd in IMDb's all-time top250. I don't think the movie is particularly bad, but to rank it even in the Top50 is a crime against a lot of brilliant film makers further down the Top250 and even more people whose works don't even appear on the list!So now I ask if anybody can please explain to me: 1) Why is this movie's average rating over 9? Does it appeal to some basic American sense of justice and love of happy endings? 2) Why did more than 65.000 people rate it? I'm pretty sure it wasn't nearly as commercially succesful as The Lord of the Rings or the Godfather with about 50000 votes. Did it do well on video in the US?And if you REALLY feel like watching movies about people behind bars why not give Cool Hand Luke or the 1974 classic(!) Caged Heat a try?I don't mean to demean The Shawshank Redemtion or anything, but I just don't get it's massive rating. Is this one of the most overrated movies of all time?

Gunton, Sadler and all the others seemed to have fun playing in this master of peace. Titanic is pure entertainment and received 11 oscars. This movie deserves 30 oscars because it shows what is really important in life. No action, more realistic, more useful than the other films.

Absolutely brilliant,"The Shawshank Redemption is one of the few movies adapted from books that turned out to be good .. or in, this case, brilliant.Although the movie supposedly takes place somewhen in the 1950's, I can easily imagine it being transferred to today's time and standards. The thing that is most fascinating about is is that the directors [and writers, of course] didn't use extreme clichés - there's no black and white painting, just numerous shades of grey. Robbins and Freeman both are perfect for their roles, as are all of the supporting actors.Finally, I can understand why a certain movies gets a high ranking.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Shawshank Redemption Comes Out Clean,"What can I say about this movie that hasn't already been said? It's a prison movie, yes, but it is so much more than that. First, let me divvy out kudos to those who deserve it: Stephen King for writing this magnum opus, Frank Darabont for his stellar directing, Tim Robbins for the job he did and, of course, Morgan Freeman for knocking the ball out of the park one this movie.This was a movie that could be loved and felt by men and women alike. It was about losses and gains, hope and despondence, injustice and rectitude, and definitely about friendship. Prison just happened to be the backdrop of this film but it could have easily been anyplace. The prison setting played a critical role and was interwoven into the overall story but it wasn't the story. The story was so much more and the movie did so well in pulling you in and making you care. You couldn't help but loathe the warden and his right-hand-man. You couldn't help but like Andy and Red. You couldn't help but want the happy ending.Absolutely, Shawshank Redemption is a masterpiece. It didn't get the awards it deserved, but like the Utah Jazz in the late 90's playing the Bulls, Shawshank Redemption faced tough competition. Although, it is getting its recognition here and it deserves the high praise.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Hope......Don't loose it at any cost,"The 'Shawshank Redemption' undoubtedly deserves to be the highest rated movie. The movie depicts how a four lettered word 'Hope' brings wonders to our lives and makes something impossible to possible.Though the plot of the movie focuses on how Andy Dufrane, a falsely convicted prisoner gets out of the prison, the beauty of the movie lies in the characterization of Andy Dufrane (just amazing) and how he influences his fellow prisoner 'Red'. The narration by Morgan Freeman in the role of 'Red' is perhaps one of the best narrations i have ever come across. This story proves that the king of horrors, Stephen King, is equally good at any other genre of 'Story Writing'(Hats off). The dialogues towards the end of the movie about hope are truly inspiring. The background score of the movie is excellent. Tom Robbins and Morgan Freeman at their best in the roles of Andy Dufrane and Red respectively.Didn't watch the movie??...go grab a DVD and watch it as soon as possible.

"#1 on IMDB's top 250, one of the best movies of all time and more than 6200 reviews... what's more to say about this movie?","As I said in the summary, there are too many reviews for this movie and it's among the best movies of all time. So, why I wanted to review it? Because this movie touched me so deeply and I found it so great and powerful that I have to say my opinion at all costs. This is out of my system, now I can go to the review.THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION is a masterpiece and only a idiot wouldn't watch it (or hate it). Everything in this movie is perfect: the dialogue is clever and well written, with many great lines (included also in the narration by Morgan Freeman), the cinematography is great, the soundtrack is among the best that were ever heard in 1990s movies, and the performances are very strong and heartfelt. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman give their best performances in their careers. Robbins is hard to empathize with at the beginning, but more the movie goes on more you come to like him. Freeman also narrates the movie, and here is suave, easy to empathize with and likeable (as in all his other movies). And also the supporting players in the movie are good, including James Whitmore in one of his final roles as Brooks Hatlen.My favourite scene apart the tear-jerking ending? The scene of the inmates listening to the Mozart aria through the speakers. So, you don't have to like prison dramas for liking this movie. Yes it's depressing and sad in points - but is also perfectly and cleverly written and acted, and deserves all the praises that received. A movie that has to be seen at least once, and if you don't love it I suggest you to go to a psychiatrist!",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
First 10 I have ever given out,"This is the best movie robbed of acclaim. I don't care what anyone says about Forest Gump. This movie is better in almost every category except music and maybe tied for movie of the year.Tim Robbins acting is as good if not better than Hanks. I always have a problem with the simpleton character getting acting nods, as with the white trash and ghetto thug characters. I think most of us can all do the Gumpy Slow Hick voice ala Cleatus the Slacked Jawed Yokel (Simpsons).I can't quite remember how many Oscars Gump stole from this GEM of a movie, but this movie blows me away on almost every level. The quite passion the Robbins portrays is surpassed by no one except maybe the Freeman sidekick character.This movie was of course a short story made into a movie (S King i think) and because of what it delivers i truly believe it to be the best movie of 1994, and probably one of the top 3 movies of all time.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
great film,I can watch this film a hundred times and still enjoy it. Morgan Freeman is one of my favorite actors. And this must be his best roll ever. I thought Tim Robbins was definitely at his best in this film. All the prison guards and inmates were really believable. The story captures you from the beginning and doesn't let go until the final credits are rolled. This is the kind of film that make you think of how many inequities must exist in our prison system that no one ever hears about. Of all the the movies of this type the Shawshank Redemtion brings to light how good and evil can exist in every situation. And that nothing is black and white.

It is a good film and i like it,"When i first watched it i like it at once,it is really a good film.i can learn a lot of things from it.¡°The Shawshank Redemption"", which is a movie about time, patience and loyalty - not sexy qualities, perhaps, but they grow on you during the subterranean progress of this story, which is about how two men serving life sentences in prison become friends and find a way to fight off despair.The story is narrated by ""Red"" Redding (Morgan Freeman), who has been inside the walls of Shawshank Prison for a very long time and is its leading entrepreneur. He can get you whatever you need: cigarettes, candy, even a little rock pick like an amateur geologist might use. One day he and his fellow inmates watch the latest busload of prisoners unload, and they make bets on who will cry during their first night in prison, and who will not. Red bets on a tall, lanky guy named Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), who looks like a babe in the woods.But Andy does not cry, and Red loses the cigarettes he wagered. Andy turns out to be a surprise to everyone in Shawshank, because within him is such a powerful reservoir of determination and strength that nothing seems to break him. Andy was a banker on the outside, and he's in for murder. He's apparently innocent, and there are all sorts of details involving his case, but after a while they take on a kind of unreality; all that counts inside prison is its own society - who is strong, who is not - and the measured passage of time.Red is also a lifer. From time to time, measuring the decades, he goes up in front of the parole board, and they measure the length of his term (20 years, 30 years) and ask him if he thinks he has been rehabilitated. Oh, most surely, yes, he replies; but the fire goes out of his assurances as the years march past, and there is the sense that he has been institutionalized - that, like another old lifer who kills himself after being paroled, he can no longer really envision life on the outside.Red's narration of the story allows him to speak for all of the prisoners, who sense a fortitude and integrity in Andy that survives the years. Andy will not kiss butt. He will not back down. But he is not violent, just formidably sure of himself. For the warden (Bob Gunton), he is both a challenge and a resource; Andy knows all about bookkeeping and tax preparation, and before long he's been moved out of his prison job in the library and assigned to the warden's office, where he sits behind an adding machine and keeps tabs on the warden's ill-gotten gains. His fame spreads, and eventually he's doing the taxes and pension plans for most of the officials of the local prison system.There are key moments in the film, as when Andy uses his clout to get some cold beers for his friends who are working on a roofing job. Or when he befriends the old prison librarian (James Whitmore). Or when he oversteps his boundaries and is thrown into solitary confinement. What quietly amazes everyone in the prison - and us, too - is the way he accepts the good and the bad as all part of some larger pattern than only he can fully see.The partnership between the characters played by Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman is crucial to the way the story unfolds. This is not a ""prison drama"" in any conventional sense of the word. It is not about violence, riots or melodrama. The word ""redemption"" is in the title for a reason. The movie is based on a story, Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption, by Stephen King, which is quite unlike most of King's work. The horror here is not of the supernatural kind, but of the sort that flows from the realization than 10, 20, 30 years of a man's life have unreeled in the same unchanging daily prison routine.The director, Frank Darabont, paints the prison in drab grays and shadows, so that when key events do occur, they seem to have a life of their own.Andy, as played by Robbins, keeps his thoughts to himself. Red, as Freeman plays him, is therefore a crucial element in the story: His close observation of this man, down through the years, provides the way we monitor changes and track the measure of his influence on those around him. And all the time there is something else happening, hidden and secret, which is revealed only at the end.""The Shawshank Redemption"" is not a depressing story, although I may have made it sound that way. There is a lot of life and humor in it, and warmth in the friendship that builds up between Andy and Red. There is even excitement and suspense, although not when we expect it. But mostly the film is an allegory about holding onto a sense of personal worth, despite everything. If the film is perhaps a little slow in its middle passages, maybe that is part of the idea, too, to give us a sense of the leaden passage of time, before the glory of the final redemption.All in all, I think it is a very good film and worthy for everybody to watch, the most important sentences ¡°Hope is a good thing , maybe the best of things, No good thing ever dies.¡± It is really make us thinking deeply, and another one which was said by Red, he said that there has one kind of birds that you could never keep him in the cage, because every feather of his body was covered by the brilliance of freedom. I think everyone should remember this , everyone of us are covered by some brilliance of our own, we should never give up no matter how difficult it is! And we should remember that ¡°hope is a good thing¡± ,we should have hopes for all our lives!--------------------------------------------------------------------------------",,Anonymous,Drama
"A very good film, but it's not Papillon","I really liked this movie, which I just recently saw for the first time, strange indeed since it is more than 10 years old. It reminded me, naturally I would say, to Papillon, the 70's McQueen/Hoffman classic.I like the story, the acting, basically everything, and I definitely recommend it to everybody. But compared to Papillon? There are so many similarities that one has to think that idea of the movie did not came out of the blue. Because of that the movie has to accept to be compared with Papillon. And Papillon is simply even better. It is emotionally much more touching, and when even Freeman's great performance doesn't match Hoffman's, there is no doubt that Robbins is not close to McQueen - in that role I mean! Tim gave a great performance but his role didn't give him the chance that Steve had.Anyway, a joy to watch. But please watch the ""original"" too, it's not old-fashioned at all! I can only guess, but I think the huge differential of 9.1 for SR and 7.9 for Papillon is because most young people have never seen Papillon.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama
"Frankly, I don't get it","''He that lives upon hope will die fasting.'' - Benjamin FranklinFrankly, I really don't get the praise for this film.

Well, that and Morgan Freeman's calming voice.Not that challenging cinematically and a bit of a fantasy that pawns itself off as gritty realism, to be honest.Not to be an alarmist, but part of me wonders whether this film would be Exhibit A should the country ever descend into a fascist dictatorship much like ""From Caligari to Hitler"" by Siegfried Kracauer examined German film during the rise of the Nazi's after World War I.

Redemptive Masterpiece; Masterful Redemption,"Despair or determination; crying or fighting; obedience or inner freedom; resignation or patience; fear or hope...difficult choices in life make us all more powerful human beings. Experience makes us richer; hardship makes us stronger, friendship makes us better. Although we may be deprived of everything, only our own choices may truly deprive us of human dignity... These words ring the bell for the majority of people; yet, seldom do they appear so unique, so real and so concrete as in this wonderful film...Based on the novella by Stephen King RITA HAYWORTH AND SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION, the story appears to be unlike any other movie, unlike any other adaptation of Stephen King's stories onto screen, unlike most productions of the world cinema. Why?I think that every viewer has to answer this question oneself. What I am going to do in this review is not look at why it is so powerful, why it is so unique but rather focus on a certain aspect that, in a way, refers to this question. What absorbed me to the very core of my emotions and feelings is the main plot of Andy (Tim Robbins), the banker wrongfully convicted of murdering his wife and her lover and sentenced to Shawshank prison where brutality and wretchedness really reign. At the spot where for many people, life actually ends, for Andy a new tedious struggle begins. Quickly befriended by ""Red"" (Morgan Freeman), actually the narrator of the story, both soon prove that even in the worst circumstances, within the ""hell on earth"" they can maintain human dignity and strive on their own way to freedom...Here, let me refer to Roger Ebert's words who nicely described the character of Andy: he says that ""Andy turns out to be a surprise to everyone in Shawshank, because within him is such a powerful reservoir of determination and strength that nothing seems to break him."" Indeed, salvation lies within discipline for him...self-discipline...Except for some other plots, including the touching yet tragic story of Tommy Williams (Gil Bellows) and of the sympathetic librarian Brooks Hatlen (James Whitmore), it is Andy and Red who supply us with the most unforgettable moments in the movie. It is, as a matter of fact, the story of their friendship, their dreams expressed at the wall of despair. They maintain hope around themselves and within the viewers. Here, a very powerful aspect of Red is his narration...our thoughts are directed towards his thoughts, towards his reflections and his perception of the events, his - the prisoner's. Swear words take on power to convey meanings and harshness becomes reality. Here, it is important to mention the inevitable brutality in the film. Thanks to the fact it is perceived by Red, it never appears to be unendurable or harmful for the emotions of the viewer. We, as observers, truly know what world we are led to...yet, there is no loss of hope!The unforgettable scenes seem to evoke the most powerful associations and expectations that lie within us concerning the visual and sensual experience. With Thomas Newman's terrific music score consisting of dark piano music, we are supplied with intense emotions and effective thrill. Except for the symbolic and almost cult scene when Andy escapes the prison (mind you the almost claustrophobic effect), one cannot skip ""The Letter Duet"" scene when the excerpt of Mozart's ""The Marriage of Figaro"" is being played. The prison life stops for a while being awestruck by the glimpse of harmony, by the blissful moment of magnificence. At this moment, I was breathless and really second the powerful line: ""Music makes you free!""The performances are awesome and the depiction of characters is executed in an extraordinary way. There are no clichés which is a great merit of the film and where many films of the genre fall into that trap. Although there were many actors who had been cast for the role of Red, I think that no one would have done the job as well as Morgan Freeman. He is perfect in the role combining a certain quality of patience and distance with the emotional struggle for personal rights. Ironically, he portrays a re-socialized character...in fact, richer inside than any ""corrupted decency."" Tim Robbins also does a terrific job as Andy with all his features mentioned before. And Bob Gunton as a true villain, the boss of this hell of Shawshank will long remain in memory.To sum it up, I agree with short but meaningful words said by Roger Ebert: ""THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION is a movie about time, patience and harmony..."" I would even add that it is the film about true life where people are really themselves, to the most extent themselves. There, within the harshest reality... Because only there, we truly behave according to our rules. There, we make choices even if everything that surrounds us seems to yell: ""Salvation lies within blind discipline and fundamental Bible!"" A redemptive masterpiece, a masterful redemption...desperate Brooks was here...and so was Red...yet, he brought a new dawn for dreams, a new dawn for friendship... Will he succeed?",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
"When they give you life, that's what they take","Out of the fertile mind of American author Steven King, comes the incredible prison story called ""The Shawshank Redemption."" It is the story of a young banker named Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) who has been falsely convicted of murdering his wife and her lover. Sent to the notorious Shawshank, Dufresne, is subjected to the standard abuses every prisoner faces. During the ensuing years however, he is further subjected to additional punishment by the ""Sisters"" who enjoy torturing what they call 'fresh fish.' Still Andy tries to survive each day of his sentence as best he can. Being extremely agile at his banking craft, he overhears Captain Byron T. Hadley (Clancy Brown) complain of his personal financial problems. This single incident allows Andy to take advantage of his dire situation and become useful once again. Over the years, he becomes friends with fellow convict Ellis ""Red"" Redding who is adroitly played by veteran actor, Morgan Freeman. When warden Samuel Norton (Bob Gunton) learns of Dufresnes' financial ability, he immediately takes advantage of it. This arrangement presents many financial opportunities for the brutal warden and the meticulous and patience prisoner. Both can benefit from the outcome. The warden intends to retire richer and Hope is the only benefit Andy ascribes to. Be he has he has more talent than the warden suspects. With additional characters actors like William Sadler as Heywood, Gil Bellows as Tommy, Mark Rolston as Bogs and legendary James Whitmore who lends a superior performance as Brooks Hatlen, this film is destined as a classic for the enjoyment of every audience. ****",9.0,Anonymous,Drama

"Graceful, intriguing Tim Robbins triumph","The Shawshank Redemption is in a league with Casablanca as a movie you can watch over and over, catching different nuances each time and bringing your own life experiences each time you watch it. Tim Robbins gives the performance of his career and this is the movie for which Morgan Freeman should have won an Oscar (a shame he had to wait for Million Dollar Baby.) There are many twists and turns and I defy anyone to watch the ending without tears running down their face. In fact, the entire last third of movie is filled with marvelous scenes. If there is any drawback to this movie, it is that it is a shade too long, meaning it's often butchered when it is shown with commercials on TV. Rent this, or better yet, buy it to get the full thrust of it. Definitely on my personal top 10.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
Don't Watch This Movie!!  (Unless you want to Cry),"I knew about this movie for a long time.Heck, prison movies, don't turn me on so I have very negative impression, hence not watching it. I watched it today (Oct 2005) as it was on TV, and I thought, it's got good rating, so I'll watch it, least this way I won't be watching it alone. Might as well get it over with.Well, any movie than can render a grown adult to tears and whirl up an emotional minefield, has to be respected. This movie has my utmost respect.This is truly a great film, even with all my negative baggage, and seeing clips, and reading people raving about it, I still avoided it.To render a grown man to cry even with all the baggage, has to be a really amazing film.This film transcends cinema, to what it's truly about - to move you. So technically, it's pointless, you can go about actors, direction, shots, music and so on, and to analyse this film purely on that level would be one very stupid mistake. A mistake many have used while writing reviews.The book or film, is simply a mechanism to get a message across, it can be flawed and still work perfectly. That's not the point.The message here is clear and works perfectly, on many unconscious levels, it really would be stupid to try an figure it out.You can't as its so simple.We all have hope dreams and desires, and want freedom and a better future. Every person does. It's actually why we exist.Not to have hope, dreams and desires and goals, is truly not to live. Not doing so, there is no meaning to life.No matter what happens, keep positive, have hopes dreams and desires, that is your purpose here on this planet this is what this film is about, everything else is just mechanics to get this across?Are you Positive?Do you have hopes?Do you have dreams?Do you have goals?Have you helped your fellow man, just for the beauty and pleasure of making someone happy, in a totally unselfish way, without any personal gain?If you haven't and don't have hopes, dreams, desires and goals, you are not alive, you have no meaning to your life.In conclusion, you can avoid this film as long as you want like I did, but when it does catch up with you... you better be ready, very ready.If you aren't or don't understand what you are watching, and what really is going on between the lines and mechanics of the imperfect mechanism of cinema you are dead, truly dead, and you might as well end it now.So my advise to you?Don't Watch this film.If you've read this far, and not got what I've been going on about you are a lost cause already, and you might as well go into your miserable life, and causing misery to yourself and others. Heck, it'll take you several lifetimes probably to get it.So, remember DON'T WATCH THIS FILM, you don't deserve it.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama

It is a pity that Forrest Gump (which I consider another masterpiece ) went out the same year and got all the publicity, as well as the Oscars.

A true story of friendship and hard times,"Shawshank Redemption is one of those infamous movies you never stop hearing about if you are a crazed movie fanatic. I've been through the entire top 250 list up and down and this is going back and fourth between #2 and #3 struggling with Lord of the Rings: The Retrun of the King. I had to see this movie to see what all the fuss is about.Based on Stephen King's novel, The Shawshank Redemption is a terrific adaptation of his book. The acting, I mean don't get me started. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman were perfectly casted and fit so well together. What I mean in my title to my summary is, I felt that I could relate. This reminded me so much of my friendship with my best friend, because her and I are so close and would do anything for each other. Even wait until the end of time just to hang out and talk again.I felt this story also brought up major important points, what does a convict do after so many years in prison? Pretty much a good job is out of the question, same with a decent place. Your family might disown you and everything you knew was in that prison. It's sort of like being shoved from a lake to an ocean and you're drowning with no life preserver. This movie actually got me thinking about that.Also there is the final notion of the court systems, because we are also dealing with Tim Robbin's life. He keeps claiming his innocence and no one will listen to him or believe him. I felt awful for him, I know there are a lot of men and women in prison who are innocent and are paying for other people's crimes.I would highly recommend The Shawshank Redemption, I believe it's better than Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King. So watch it and understand this movie, it's important. This should be watched by everyone and you get out of the movie what you bring into it.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
#2 in the TOP 250 is right!!!,"I saw this movie for the first time a year ago. In those days I was browsing the IMDb when I saw this movie ranked #2 in the top 250.

Definitely this is the best movie I've ever seen. The story, the direction and the cast (Specially Tim, Morgan and Gil Bellows) are perfect! The Shawshank Redemption really deserves that spot in the rankings. This movie is a ""must see""! Thanks IMDb and all IMDb users for the top 250 and the wake-up call!",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
"Captivating, breathtaking and compelling...","The Shawshank Redemption is, without a doubt, the greatest film ever made. You simply will never find a better film, ever.The story revolves around a smart, kind hearted vice president of a bank named Andy Dufresne, played by Tim Robbins, who is absolutely brilliant in the starring role. Andy is sent to prison after murdering his wife and lover. Claiming he is innocent of the crimes, and was the victim of an unfortunate coincidence, the law does not believe him, and sentences him to life in prison without possibility of parole. Once inside, he immediately befriends a criminal by the name of Red, played brilliantly by Morgan Freeman. Andy then becomes the victim of fear, despair, and the prison itself, which is inhabited by crooked officials and hardened criminals. After a while, Andy finds the hope inside of him to never give up, with the help of his friend Red and others. He starts doing tax returns for the prison guards and the warden, and after a while, the warden, played by Bob Gunton, who makes the viewer loathe the word warden, has Andy doing his tax fraud for him. It's safe to say that Andy is ""friends"" with the officials.I don't want to give it away for those of you who haven't seen this picture, but believe me, you will be breathless. The hope Andy holds inside of him gives all of us a warm feeling inside of us, and tells you to never give up. The cast is perfect in every way, and the film just carries beautifully. You will find yourself praying for Andy through the whole film, through bad times and even good times. It is wonderfully capped off with a surprise twist ending that will leave you shocked, stunned and emotionally breathless.I call this film my all time favorite, because I agreed with the characters, felt for them, hoped for them and in the case of the corrupt characters, loathed them, due to great acting. I was able to actually hate and detest certain characters, because that's how wonderful the acting is. I would actually have cried at this movie, if it weren't for me being so emotionally paralyzed by the cast and story.",,Anonymous,Drama
Why so high?,"This is indeed one of the best prison dramas I've ever seen. I've always been a fan of Tim Robbins and he doesn't let me down here. But I can't believe this is so high in the overall list (I would place it in the 150-200 range myself). Even if we just stick with Tim Robbins, 'The Player', 'Short Cuts' and 'Jacob's Ladder' are all far better films. It was the ending of the film that really disappointed me, but since I'm not allowed to talk about endings in these reviews I can't explain why! Suffice it to say that I can imagine at least two fairly obvious endings that would have been better. Maybe it's the 'American Factor', what with me being English, but the overrating of this film completely baffles me.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama

"A Powerful Story of Courage, Perseverance and Friendship ...","I will never forget the first time I watched ""The Shawshank Redemption"", with my father. Both of us were fans of prison and male-bonding movies, and choose the film only expecting to watch a solid drama. Needless to say that, when the last line was delivered and the TV screen painted the walls with a beautiful blue, the feeling that we had just watched something exceptional instantly cut through our hearts, and before the second viewing, we would regularly mention how great that film ""with the poster"" was.Then I would never miss it whenever I found it on TV, and after each viewing, it unveiled one unsuspected element of its unique appeal. I guess if it doesn't justify, at least it explains why this movie that didn't do well in the theaters, had a better success on VHS, TV and DVD before it would ultimately dethrone ""The Godfather"" from the first place on IMDb Top 250. And it's only justice if ""The Shawshank Redemption"", the least spectacular of the four Best Picture nominees in the glorious 1994, made by a relatively unknown director, a movie with an appeasing and appealing patience, took its time to grow on people and did it pretty well, as if it applied its own philosophy, patiently but determinedly.This is the strength of ""The Shawshank Redemption"", its ability to tell a story that spans a long period of time without trying to get to the so-called essential, the simplest things take their full meanings, the smallest details have their share of importance. And think about it, in a prison where everyone wears the same outfits, where the days are regulated by the same routine, all you can do is to make a life out of this routine, make a place, to get closer to your own definition of 'having a life'. And as we penetrate the impressive walls of Shawshank, from the first vertiginous panoramic shot, we're literally submerged by the solemn austerity of the location, conveying a very hostile feel. These characteristics are perfectly incarnated by the figure of the Warden Samuel Norton, who's like the male alter-ego of Nurse Ratched from ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"". And the comparison with Forman's film isn't fortuitous as Shawshank intends to domesticate its occupants to the same limits of mechanical alienation, to the point that the only thing left to the inmates is to control their only valuable treasure: time, by getting busy, finding their own reason-to-be, like the veteran Brooks (James Whitmore) was the man with the books, Red, remarkably played by Morgan Freeman, was the man who could get you things.In a very intelligent move from the script, the hero of the film, the laconic Andy Dufresne, an upper-class banker, played in all nuance by Tim Robbins, is condemned to a life sentence at Shawshank, for the murder of his wife and her lover. And nothing indicates if he is innocent or guilty and I wondered if any certitude would have conditioned my appreciation of the character. I think it was necessary for us to have a reasonable doubt about his innocence in order to let his character progressively grow on us until we believe by ourselves that he was indeed the victim of unfortunate circumstances, the same feeling that grew in the heart of Red before becoming his best friend. Morgan Freeman is the pillar of the film while Tim Robbins is its free spirit, both allow us in a remarkable complementarity to dream of abstract notions like hope and freedom while being practical and 'busy' in the same time. And again, their friendship is a slow process that takes its time to progress and reaches a pivotal point when Andy was allowed to put his banker's casket again and feels that prison didn't deprive him from his 'social quality'. Shawshank is not slow but more a patience-demanding film with a sense of decency in the way it trusts our intelligence.And the film's motto, on which relies its philosophical core is ""Get busy living or get busy dying"". Now, two things occur to me while writing these lines, a heart-breaking sequence about the inmate Brooks who was freed after 50 years of detention, and who realized he was institutionalized. A notion explained by Red: when the infamous wall that scared you so much becomes your personal guiding light while outside, it's all dark and your time is deconstructed. Brooks couldn't live outside Shawshank so there was no other way he could live. The second thing is the sad passing of Steve Jobs today. And as I was reading his famous Stanford speech, I couldn't help but make a connection with the beautiful message of Darabont's film, an invitation to dream, to escape from any sort of walls or obstacles put in your life and heart with as many dreams as you can fulfill, a notion illustrated by the beautiful scene when Andy put some classical music on the microphone, so the prisoners could for once elevate themselves and having an ephemeral moment of pure freedom, this is the triumph of human spirit, this understanding of the value of life is ""The Shawshank Redemption""In the same vein than ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"", ""Shawshank"" is a constant encouragement to fight the system and use time for the best, for whatever constitutes our dreams, being men again, able to enjoy, to feel, to give a meaning to our lives. In other words, hope, hope that things can get better despite the adversity. To quote Steve Jobs : ""Courage is the discovery that you may not win, and trying when you know you can lose."" This is the true intelligence of life, what makes it worth living.""The Shawshank Redemption"" a powerful adaptation of Stephen King's novel is one of the greatest American films: a powerful story of courage, perseverance, hope and ultimately, friendship and humanity.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
One word. Outstanding.,"Now, I see what everybody was talking about. It took me 4 years to see this, in my opinion, masterpiece. If you have not seen this movie rent it anyway you can.

Perfectly written. Perfectly directed. Perfectly cast. Perfectly acted. Perfect,"I have seen The Shawshank Redemption twice now, the second time being about a week ago. After the first time I saw it, I gave it a perfect 10 rating on IMDb, something I do very rarely (I've given out 20 ratings of 10 out of the 600+ movies I've rated). However, after just one viewing, I felt so impacted by this film that it immediately rocketed near the top of my favorite movie list. After a second viewing, I feel even more amazed by it than I was the first time I saw it.The movie captures your interest in the first scene and unfolds new plot points and character developments slowly at first and then more rapidly as the movie goes on. The movie runs about 130 minutes long, but it never gets boring. While it is admittedly slow paced, this only serves into its greatness. It allows the viewer to get to know the characters of Andy and Red and sympathize with them; along the way, we also get to know and grow attached to the other prisoners trapped inside Shawshank. The movie flows perfectly from one scene to the next, never feeling forced or losing your interest. The movie is mostly dialogue driven, but there are some violent scenes which help convey the brutality of prison life.Finally, the final 30 minutes are perhaps the most satisfying in any movie. I do not want to spoil the ending for those who have never seen it, but suffice to say, the final act of the movie leaves you floored. Both times that I saw it, I was rooted to my seat long after the credits rolled, just thinking about the brilliance of the ending and the entire movie as a whole. Forrest Gump and Pulp Fiction are both great movies, highly entertaining. I particularly love Pulp Fiction; however, it is a travesty that The Shawshank Redemption did not win Best Picture. It was certainly the best film of the year in my opinion, arguably the best film of the decade, and perhaps one of the finest movies ever made. The even bigger tragedy, though, is that while Morgan Freeman earned an Oscar nomination for his great performance, Tim Robbins' turn as Andy Dufresne went without a nomination. Robbins carries the film, and his performance is truly one of the greatest I have ever seen.The bottom line is that The Shawshank Redmption is a perfect movie. It takes you in from the opening scene and doesn't let you go until long after it comes to a tremendous close. Along the way, it will make you think, fear, wonder, and feel a number of other emotions. If you have not seen this movie, waste no time; go rent it today and see why this is the highest ranked film on IMDb.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama

"Very good, but probably over-praised","The amazing thing about this film is how many people fail to realise that the film is about Red, not Andy. It's Reds perspective of Andy.

The photography is magical, the story is strong, the performances are exceptional and the depths of despair and humanity of canvassed well without losing mainstream appeal.But that aside, there is a strong willingness to overstate this film.

Entertaining but still very much a piece of fiction,"Watching this film made me think about the genre of ""prison""-movies and what the theme really is in these stories. All of them seem to have some common elements; the warden is a psychopath, there is almost always some inmate that is out to get the protagonist in some way, there is the companionship and last but not least the portrayal of the human spirit that will not be broken in the direst of circumstances. And maybe that is what ""shawshank"" wants to tell us; that the strong individual can beat an unfair and cruel system by different means. In this story we have Andy Dufresne who is clever but also able to endure visits in ""the hole"" many times without developing psychiatric phenomena. In this sense I will claim that this movie is just as much a piece of fiction as lets say ""starwars"" is. It is simply not possible to stay sane if you are repeatably treated in a degrading manner and if you live in constant fear. The movie is highly entertaining but should not be seen as a serious attempt to explore human reactions in a prison environment where inmates are treated as garbage. Don't fool yourself on this account. Luke Skywalker is just as real as the character of Andy Dufresne is.Regards SimonPs.

One Of The Most Inspiring And Beautiful Movies Of All Time,"Greetings from Lithuania.It is very hard to call ""The Shawshank Redemption"" (1994) a masterpiece, but it is a definitely one of the most inspiring and beautifully crafted picture off all time. That said, i won't going into details, as plot and everything about this movie is so well known. To simply put, this is a story of two men in prison sentenced to life time and their journey to redemption.Seeing this movie ~ 5 times in my life i can say that when some time passes, you kinda feel a need to re-watch it again, because this movie is like a journey itself, with characters drawn so sharply that we do care about them and the outcome is one of the most powerful and hope inspiring there is. I brake every single time when watching sequence when Brooks gets out of prison and the whole sequence of living free - it is a powerful film making so say the least.Overall, No.1 at IMDb Top 250 says a lot - this is a movie that stays with you and inspires you not to lose hope. It is flawlessly paced - at running time 2 h 20 min it never drags - it should be studied at film making universities HOW to create a film with no women characters, when action takes place inside the prison and there isn't mainstream action at all.

Masterpiece.,"The Shawshank Redemption is a true masterpiece and a genius work of cinematic excellence. It is a true testament to human will, friendship, and determination.

Not as good as you think it is,"Mostly what can been said has been said. This really isn't anywhere near he greatest movie ever made. For heaven's sake, it's a competent genre flick that runs a little too long but contains a couple of well-turned performances from the leads. Tim Robbins, incidentally, is way better in Mystic River.Down by Law and Birdman of Alcatraz are both significantly more interesting and original prison movies than this one. Cool Hand Luke is obviously the greatest prison film of all time. Shawshank is so-so. Think about it, was there a moment, a second, a single plot turn in that film you didn't know was coming? When the young guy goes out for his little conference with the warden, did you not think 'come on, guy, haven't you seen any movies?' Predictability is satisfying I suppose, in its way, but give me originality and genuine passion every time. Shawshank has neither of those attributes.

Observations...,"Almost as interesting as this tale of men behind bars is the enduring popularity it has enjoyed since being released on video following its poor box office. The reason is fairly clear to see: for all its dark setting, the film is about hope and how hope can set you free. We all have hope, and we all feel imprisoned – whether it's by a dead-end job, a loveless relationship, an out-of-shape body – and it's only the hope that things will somehow improve (even if, unlike Andy Dufresne, we do precious little to help things along) that keeps us going. The Shawshank Redemption validates this blind, irrational hope while simultaneously reinforcing it. This is the film's strength, and it uses it to good advantage. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman make believable if unlikely friends – at the beginning of their friendship one lacks hope of any kind while the other is unable to express his feelings, a flaw he later realises is indirectly the reason he finds himself behind bars. By the end of the film both have changed – and both are released.The film makes use of every genre cliché you can think of: the sadistic guard, the corrupt warden – fifty years ago, Hollywood wardens were mostly beneficial characters, but they seem to have lost their way lately – the bull queers, the fish out of water with no chance of survival, etc, and although this isn't necessarily a weakness, it's familiarity means the overlong running time drags on occasion as we're faced with all too familiar situations. And while there are malevolent prisoners present in the form of the bull queers who wander around looking for 'fresh fish' and vulnerable inmates to rape, all other prisoners are a kind of homogeneous mass, a decent enough bunch with few unique characteristics and no malice or resentment towards a society that has effectively discarded them.The irony of the film is that the good guys are the ones behind bars – as Dufresne wryly comments, he had to come to prison to become a criminal – while those ostensibly representing justice and law are violent braggarts and bible-bashing hypocrites. Their come-uppance, when it finally arrives, is wholly deserved, and there are few films that engineer a turning of the tables as wholly complete as the one engineered here by Dufresne – another reason for its phenomenal popularity: we all know, or have known, someone like the warden (although perhaps not as extreme), smug and self-serving, who deserves their come-uppance.Darabont wanted the film to end with Red giving his little 'I hope' bit while the bus he's travelling on disappears over the horizon, and it's a shame the studio didn't let him have his way. That ending on the beach looks exactly like what it is – a tacked on ending to keep the men in suits happy. Andy Dufresne, with his uncompromising sense of purpose, would surely have held firm under their pressure",8.0,Anonymous,Drama
Greatest Stephen King adaptation of all time,"The Shawshank Redemption (1994) was the feature length film directorial debut of Frank Darabont and it has been hailed as one of the greatest movies in the history of cinema. This was a first time watch and the movie definitely lived up to the hype and expectations.Positives for The Shawshank Redemption (1994):
As the movie's title would suggest, this is a story about redemption for our group of characters as they are stuck in prison under the cruel leadership of the warden. This is one of the best stories I've seen in any movie in my entire life and it's no surprise why this got nominated for Best Screenplay and it should've been nominated and won Best Picture, but then again the Oscars don't know real cinema. It goes without saying that everyone in the cats does a phenomenal job with their performances. The standout performances are easily Tim Robbins as Andy Dufresne and Morgan Freeman as Ellis Boyd ""Red"" Redding. I can safely say that these two are among the greatest movie characters of all time and I love the interactions they have with each other throughout the movie. Then, you have Bob Gunton as Samuel Norton and Clancy Brown as Byron Hadley, who are among the most hated movie characters I've seen in a long time. There are a lot of times where these two punks do stuff to the prisoners that shouldn't even be happening and yet they can do it because they think they're above the law. The moment when they finally get caught for their misdeeds was so satisfying to see happen and they both got exactly what they deserved. And finally, the final scene is simply one of the best movie endings in the history of cinema.Overall, The Shawshank Redemption (1994) is a true testament to the art of filmmaking and has earned its spot as one of my favorite movies of all time.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
I liked it,"""The Shawshank Redemption"" is a cinematic masterpiece that perfectly captures the essence of hope, friendship, and resilience. The film follows the journey of Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), a banker wrongly convicted of murder, as he navigates the harsh realities of Shawshank prison. Morgan Freeman delivers an unforgettable performance as Red, the seasoned inmate who befriends Andy and narrates the story with depth and emotion.What makes this film truly exceptional is its storytelling. Frank Darabont's direction, combined with Stephen King's powerful source material, results in a film that keeps you engaged from start to finish. The pacing is perfect, the dialogues are thought-provoking, and the emotional payoff is immense. The cinematography and Thomas Newman's hauntingly beautiful score add to the film's timeless appeal.Beyond being a prison drama, The Shawshank Redemption is a story about never giving up, no matter the odds. The climax is one of the most satisfying in film history, leaving the audience inspired and deeply moved. It's no surprise that this film remains at the top of IMDb's list of greatest movies ever made.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama

"If you can say overrated, I can say Shawshank Redemption","In the long and storied history of cinema, there have always been those films, which are undoubtly overrated.  However, none before and none since have been more overrated then The Shawshank Redemption.  While the Shawshank Redemption is not a waste of your viewing times by any means, it is not the pinnacle of film making.  The performances are good, especially Freeman, but I'm not too high on the way the plot works out.  It doesn't really break any new ground, a man is wrongfully convicted of a crime he didn't commit(Wow, that's new!!), and learns to cope with his new circumstances, while befriending the prison veterans.  While the audience learns a valuable lesson about the determination and courage of the human spirit!  I don't know about you all, but when Robbins escapes from prison during a dramatic thunderstorm, there were more then a few tears coming down my face.  When I see something like this rated in the top 10 films of the 1990s let alone of all time, I have to wonder about people's taste in general.  The message of the movie isn't incredibly powerful nor is the plot.  How can anyone consciously say this movie was the best ever?  It boggles my mind, but I have a few theories.  First this movie is recent enough and shown on TNT enough (like 5 times a month), that alot of people have seen it more then once.  Younger people (I'm talking teens and twenties), who haven't seen many Dramas let alone the real ""great"" movies, will say this is the best. If you ask this same demographic what is the best comedy of all time, they are likely to say something like Happy Gilmore (which Caddyshack blows out of the water for best golf comedy).  These are the kinds of people giving Shawshank it's highest praise, these people are sadly my generation.",6.0,Anonymous,Drama

Morgan Freeman is the only great thing in this movie,"Satisfying, good movie, but the only great part of this movie is the magnificent performance by Morgan Freeman.

good movie,"Man, I just finished ""The Shawshank Redemption,"" and let me tell you, it hit me like a right hook from Red himself. Here's the thing: I'm 25, fresh outta a brutal breakup, and feeling lost like Andy Dufresne in that prison yard. But this movie, man, it gave me a flicker of hope, a spark to fight for my own freedom.It ain't about some grand escape, though Andy pulling that off was pretty damn sweet. It's about the tiny victories, the chipping away at the walls (metaphorical and literal) that confine you. Like Andy carvin' that chess piece outta soap, bit by bit, year after year. That's the resilience I gotta find, you know?And Red, man, that dude's got wisdom dripping off him like rain. He's seen it all, the good, the bad, the ugly, and he ain't lost his hope. He tells Andy, ""Hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things, and no good thing ever dies."" That line, man, it stuck with me. It's like a lifeline, a reminder that even in the darkest depths, there's a chance to claw your way back to the light.Now, I ain't sayin' I'm gonna tunnel out of my apartment with a rock hammer, but ""The Shawshank Redemption"" did something for me. It showed me that even when you're stuck, even when you're beat down, there's a way to fight back. It's about finding your own hope, your own way to crawl through the Shawshank of your own life. And maybe, just maybe, find your own redemption on the other side.That's what this movie left me with, a 25-year-old with a bruised heart, but a newfound spark in his eyes. And hey, if Andy Dufresne can make it, maybe I can too.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama

Dangerous Simplicity,"I enjoyed this the first time I saw it. But then again I was only an easily impressionable 14-year-old, craving for new emotion. Recently, more than 10 years later, I revisited it, and barely managed to finish it. Bluntly, it's as plain and trite as it gets. In fact, I believe Frank deliberately wanted it that way, so that it would increase its appeal to the casual movie goers. In general, I have no problem with a simple, feel-good movie that does not take itself too seriously and is not looking to change its audience in a profound way. However, this does and it seems it is succeeding unfortunately....We have a story about hope and its redemptive qualities, portrayed by an innocent man that is sent to prison(Tim's character). It's told through the eyes of his closest prison friend(Morgan's character). The narrative framing and flow are rigid, there is no rhythm, no ebb and flow, no metaphors, no irony, just constant relentless narration - extreme simplicity. It's stripped to the point that you can only remember the generic message. Dangerous stuff. Some people carry it around and ""apply"" it diligently. The others only observe the snowball effect.I hope there are more intelligent endeavors out there. I hope everyone sees them and appreciates them. I hope...1/5 - Skip this, if you are over 15.

The Shawshank Redemption: A Timeless Tale of Hope and Resilience,"Few films have achieved the enduring acclaim and emotional depth of *The Shawshank Redemption*.

I can see why this is rated Number 1 on IMDb.,"Based on ratings by users, I can see why this film is rated number 1 on IMDb.A film about Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), who claims he was falsely imprisoned. He decides to adjust to life while incarcerated, and befriends a number of his fellow inmates, including Ellis Boyd Redding (Morgan Freeman). Andy establishes respect among his cohorts and even the prison guards by doing a number of things in improving life in the prison, including expanding a library and helping people do taxes. The men's friendships grow over the years as try to find, as the IMDb plot puts it, ""solace and eventual redemption through acts of common decency."" This movie is on the longer side, being over two hours long. However, the many elements in this film do not drag, making this movie an intriguing and exciting feature. The plot and subplots were solid, blending together well, and the cast of characters gave a strong, dramatic and memorable performance. There were action, humor, drama, tragedy and hope all mixed in, providing you a very entertaining film.There are far too many aspects of this film to be mentioned all at once in this review.

A Contrarian View,"Okay, let's say this from the word go...Shawshank Redmeption might as well be called Fantasy Island visits Alcatraz.

Innocent man sent to jail has a journey of self discovery 5.)  All illiterate convicts speak flawless english and spout witty phrases. 6.)  No racial tension, in fact no blacks with any character except Morgan Freeman doing a version of the kindly butler from a Shirley Temple picture...after all, it appears all he is there for is to be the witty sidekick and supply cigarettes and pictures of scantily clad women. 7.)  A black man runs the illegal smuggling into the prison 8.)  Nobody in jail is bad, or even seems like they could be violent, they are all a bunch of happy go lucky working class stiffs.  I guess this means we should be able to identify with rapists and murderers as they are just like us...a chilling thought. 9.)  Nobody except the hero ever attempts an escape or seems to want to escape, 10.) Over use of metaphors such as rain as a metaphor of washing himself clean of his past and putting on a new life.I am not saying that all prison films have to be a version of Scared Straight, but come on, this is clearly a fantasy prison and the very unreality of it undercuts anything the movie might be trying to say.  The Shawshank Redemption is in this reviewers eye nothing more than another holier than thou morality play packaged as ""gritty realism"" all because it is based in a prison...ho-hum.",,Anonymous,Drama
"Sometimes, we all just don't agree.","Last week, I had seen ""The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King"" and I feel it is one of the best movies ever made, especially in these hard to entertain folks at the movies for $10 a seat times. I couldn't understand how some, as minority as their voices were, could not like that film.That was until I decided to sit down and write how I feel about this film.In the 9 years since it has come out, I have attempted to watch it 12 times. Three of those times, I slept through it. I finally took some extra caffine Coke and gave it a twirl -- twice. Sorry, I just didn't warm up to this film. Robbins and Freeman's acting was good, but I guess the story wasn't original -- or surprising to me. I just didn't care about these guys, nor anyone else. It's prison. The guilty as well as the innocent are there -- I get that concept. Sometimes you're released after serving time, sometimes you're not. You make friends...fine. I dunno, kinda reminds me of 4 years of High School or college I guess. I just don't care about those folks no matter what we all did together once I got out, which is why I just didn't care about these and wondered why they should. Move on. Thanks for sharing. Snooze.First I thought, I might not be a big ""prison"" entertainment fan, but then I remembered one of my favorite films is ""Birdman of Alcatraz"" (which I thought much from this film owes homage to), I really fell in love with ""The Green Mile"" (which was more on King's level than this) and I actually sat through a few seasons of HBO's ""Oz"" which was gritty and scary, to say the least. I give everything a chance, in fact -- several chances. But sometimes not all things appeal to all people. For me, this was one of them. (If you're wondering, ""Reservoir Dogs"" is another.)The point is...as I was going to write awful things to those few folks who didn't like ""The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King"", I find myself here at ""The Shawshank Redemption"", and now I am able to stand where they were -- for a moment -- in the minority.All things are not wonderful to all people.And that's....a good thing.",3.0,Anonymous,Drama
Redeeming hope.,"I realise now that the immense praise that Shawshank receives - being number 1 on the IMDb list, nearly universal adoration and a cemented position as an iconic classic - is all completely deserved.I had been wanting to watch The Shawshank Redemption for a couple years, and once I did it blew me away. I even wanted to watch it again today, just a day after, and relive this movie again and the joy it gave me.I've gotten used to watching very subpar, modern movies but this was a movie that deeply moved me - it tells the story of a man, Andy Dufresne, wrongly jailed for a crime he didn't commit, and illustrates his life over the next 20 years, and the unforgettable characters he meets along the way. It is a movie about friendship in its purest and simplest forms.Shawshank is a gem because it makes you think - but about things what will be unique to you: about yourself, life, and what you make of its ephemerality, (or power, corruption and the justice system). It evokes visceral emotion in you: empathy, love: you will root for the main characters and feel a growing bond with them through the 2 hours and 22 minutes, almost as if you are an inmate and a friend in Shawshank yourself; it will make you laugh and make you cry.The script is genuinely beautifully written, and several times throughout I thought to myself how it often sounded like poetry. Morgan Freeman in particular delivers an amazing, sensitive performance through both his narration and acting, and the rest of the cast are equally as essential and perfect for their characters, with rich visuals and cinematography bringing the camaraderie and encapsulating the mood in Shawshank to life respectively.This movie will bring you hope, which may be a dangerous thing, but which also may be the best of things - as well as something that we all quite possibly need now, today, more than ever.Sorry for writing such a long review and thank you for reading. I love Shawshank!!",10.0,Anonymous,Drama

A Story Of Hope & Resilence,"Frank Darabont directed this superb adaptation of the Stephen King novella that stars Tim Robbins as Andy Dufresne, a young banker who was wrongfully convicted for the murders of his wife and her boyfriend. Upon arrival at Shawshank prison in Maine, he keeps to himself mostly, causing no trouble, though does befriend long-time inmate ""Red' Redding(played by Morgan Freeman) who teaches him the ropes of prison life, though the unwanted attentions of degenerate inmates pushes poor Andy to the edge of despair, until his financial skills as a banker prove most useful to both the corrupt Captain of the guards(played by Clancy Brown) and corrupt warden(played by Bob Gunton) until Andy hits upon a most clever escape plan...

The Shawshank Redemption: A Masterpiece of Hope and Friendship,"If there's one movie I'd recommend to anyone, it's The Shawshank Redemption. This film is the perfect example of storytelling done right. It's emotional, gripping, and leaves you thinking about it long after the credits roll. Honestly, it's a solid 10/10 in my book.The story revolves around Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), a banker who is wrongly imprisoned for the murder of his wife. What follows is a tale of resilience, friendship, and hope in the bleakest of circumstances. Morgan Freeman as Red, the narrator and Andy's closest friend in Shawshank, delivers one of the most iconic performances ever. His voice alone could carry the entire movie, but paired with his acting, it's pure gold.What really sets this film apart is its pacing and attention to detail. Every scene feels purposeful, and the way the plot unfolds keeps you hooked. The bond between Andy and Red is so well-developed that you feel their highs and lows as if they were your own. And the ending? It's one of the most satisfying conclusions ever, a perfect payoff for the journey you've just been taken on.Beyond the incredible acting and plot, the film has a deeper message about the power of hope and perseverance. It shows how even in the darkest times, the human spirit can shine through. The dialogue is unforgettable (who doesn't love the ""Get busy living or get busy dying"" line?), and the cinematography is stunning, especially considering it was made in the 90s.If you haven't watched it yet, do yourself a favor and make it your next movie night pick. It's not just a film; it's an experience.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
"The best, pure and simple.","In this era of television, and cable television, and satellite television, we are bombarded with movies, old movies, new movies, PPV movies, made for TV movies. There are so many outlets these days, that its unlikely that you'll watch any movie on TV today, and not have another opportunity to watch the same film, in its entirety within a week.Amidst this morass of celluloid, and electronic representations thereof, there are films, which never leave you. You may be absentmindedly changing the channel on a Saturday afternoon, or late on a Friday night when you come across one, a scene, any scene, will play. Whether it be from the beginning, middle, or end, it hardly matters-- it is immediately recognizable to you. Your mouth will begin to make the words the actors are to say, unconsciously. A smile may come to your face as does a friendly, warm feeling inside, you may feel a tear, or fear the tear to come.You will move aside the bedclothes you were changing in order to find a spot to sit on the end of the bed, you will adjust the volume to your taste. You will not go for a drink, or a snack, but remain, transfixed.Such is the magic of movies, and there are many movies for many people, but 'The Shawshank Redemption' is one for us all. It is the sweetest music, and our conductor, Frank Darabont is indeed a maestro.The wonderful story behind the making of the film starts with  the generosity of  Stephen King. King of course gets a premium price any time one of his novels is adapted. He has chosen to give young, unproven filmmakers an opportunity to adapt any of his short stories (as opposed to the novels) for the bargain basement price of $1. There is only one caveat, that they send him a video tape of their finished film. This opportunity, Frank Darabont took to advantage and made a short film, based on a King story, ""TheWoman in the Room"".  And King was impressed. When years later Frank Darabont came back to King hoping to adapt something called  'Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption', King was only too happy to accede.What came from Mr. Darabont is true cinematic history. Thank you sir, thank you both.",,Anonymous,Drama

You root for Andy Dufresne from the very beginning as a man unfairly targeted by fate, and you want desperately for him to succeed . . . somehow.

Many people can be your foes but you fake it till you make it. I will never forget this movie and its teaching of continously adapting to the new changes instead of giving up.

My second favorite movie of all time,"Shawshank is one of the only movies I have ever scored as 10 out of 10. I had read the Stephen King short long before I saw the movie, and loved it, but had no idea going into the movie that it was the same story. Halfway thru the movie I finally put two and two together and almost jumped out of my seat at the theater to say ""OMG, I love this story!"" Fortunately I managed to resist and hide the fact that I'm totally freaking insane for at least one more day...But I digress. The movie stars Tim Robbins as Andy Dufraine, a man convicted of murdering his wife. He is sentenced to life at Shawshank prison. Although convicted of the same type of brutal crime as his fellow inmates, it quickly becomes apparent that Andy is an oddity at Shawshank. Highly educated, quiet and philosophical, Andy is initially a source of curiosity and unease to his fellow inmates but is soon befriended by Ellis 'Red' Redding, played by Morgan Freeman, and quickly becomes one of their own.Without giving too much away, the movie follows Andy's life in prison, as narrated by Freeman, as he finds a way to both survive and hold on to a shred of his humanity in a place that seeks to rob him of both. Andy learns, for example, to bargain with what he has (i.e. his financial knowledge) for what he needs. Initially, many of the things Andy acquires during the course of the film seem to have little value, but you realize by the end of the film that what he has asked for has had value beyond measure, both in the pragmatic sense and in a deeper philosophical sense.The movie is at its core an exploration of what it is to be human. It is about loss, regret, perseverance, friendship, and ultimately, faith. How do we deal with the mistakes that we have made in life? How do we recover when life beats us down? And how can we seek strength in our connections to others? These are all ideas that Shawshank looks at. It is alternately funny, tragic, violent, and inspirational. Probably one of the best stories King ever wrote and without question one of the best films ever made.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Robbed at the Academy Awards,"By far Shawshank was the best film of 1994. But look who it was up against at the Oscars...Forrest Gump. It's not that Forrest Gump was such a horrible movie as alot of people make it out to be, in fact it was good. But it was also a very hyped movie. The public ate it up, and they also got too much of it. That might be the reason everybody on the internet seems to hate it so. But to say Forrest Gump is better than the Shawshank Redemtion is a far cry. I wish the Oscar's didn't do this all the time. They vote on who they think the public wants to win it seems like sometimes. It was robbed. But that doesn't make it any less of a film. It's a triumph of filmmaking. Robbins and Freeman are excellent. The character Brooks is terrific, and the warden is protrayed perfectly by Bob Gunton. Go rent this movie, if it's the last thing you do.

So it's not everyday that you watch the greatest movie of your lifetime.,"I will always remember the night I watched this movie for the first time.

It is that good. It's like nothing I ever see in my lifetime can ever compare to the emotional roller coaster that 'The Shawshank Redemption' takes you on.First question I usually ask people when discussing films is, ""So have you seen Shawshank?"".

"A great film, but #2?","A great film and one that I shall be adding to my collection at some point, but #2?One user put it very well when they said that the film's essential message of 'the human spirit conquering all' is very uplifting an' everything but sounds too much like a fortune cookie homily.There are several films that deliver the same message just as well if not better. Jim Sheridan's ""In the Name of the Father"" springs immediately to mind. That film has a similar theme to this one (wrongful imprisonment and the struggle to come to terms with it) but is a much better film IMO. What's even more heartening is that it's also true.Like I said, I'm not dissing the film. it IS great. From what I can remember all the performances are nicely judged (Freeman is excellent, but then what's new?), the direction is perfect because it's so unobtrusive to the story, and the film in general is uplifting. I just think it's nothing particularly new and it has been done better. Maybe my viewpoint is borne out by the fact that it only became a huge success on video release?I gave it an 8.

"This is a film that you live, not watch","To call The Shawshank Redemption a great film would be doing it no justice at all. This is a film that when I watched it the first time I couldn't believe how good it was.  I expected a film that would pass the time by, and I got a film that I could identify with.  If you are feeling sad, and you think the world's a rubbish place, this fills you with hope.  I love the opening scene where the camera pans around the prison, and then the music kicks in, it makes you feel awe-inspired.The acting was brilliant, you believed what everyone said (some films the words are delivered with such cheesiness and fake ness, that it makes you want to throw up). I have watched Spiderman, and even the lines in that make you feel that they mean nothing, they just sound good.The film and book reciprocated the message 'Hope Springs Eternal', which means so much because we always live in hope that tomorrow it will be better, things might change for us, and hope never dies.I think, when Tim Robbins speaks about music, how you can never take it away, because it's in your head.  If I have a rubbish day at work, then it's true that music just lifts you, which is re-emphasised with the scene where he plays the music full blast around the prison (this of example of piece of script, which means, so much). The movie uses music to it's full potential to give more impact to the words and the characters.This film cannot replicated, because the film is a piece of art, the Director wanted to make money, but he also wanted to make a piece of film that made you feel something, that had some effect on you after the movie was over. The movie has no bad points it's what a story should be about, it takes you somewhere that you nether been, and makes you feel you lived that experience, and you can learn from that experience.  The lines delivered, will always be remembered 'Get busy living, or get busy dying' (this is the dilemma we face in everyday live).

Andy and reds friendship is a strong unique bond, founded under the harshest of circumstances. In prison they each serve their time for situations they got themselves into, but certainly didn't form them as men - or messed with their true character. Andy has no choice but to try and accept his fate, that he will be in Shawshank forever - and on the surface he rises to the occasion by doing the paperwork for the sadistic warden, who treats Andy like the lowest of the low.

I would give it to Kubrick's The Shining, but it's more like Kubrick took the story idea and did his own movie on it. In other words, while it's a classic, it's not that great of an adaption. Andy Dufresne is wrongly imprisoned for murdering his philanderous wife and while in prison befriends a prisoner named Red, who is great at getting outside products to the inmates.

"A genre picture, but a satisfying one...","Tim Robbins plays Andy Dufresne, a man convicted of double murder who is sent to jail, eventually befriending other lifers including Morgan Freeman's Ellis Redding. Exceptionally handsome adaptation of Stephen King's short story ""Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption"" (in the film version, it's really Raquel Welch, not Rita, who aids in the ultimate twist). On the surface, it's another prison-genre picture with the usual stereotypes such as a rotten warden, a cruel guard, a few homosexuals, and a quirky old-timer who doesn't want his parole. However, the film's emotions run surprisingly deep, justice is well served by the conclusion, and several of the cast members carve out amazing, three-dimensional characterizations. The finale is pure fantasy, however it does provide the audience with the release it needs, and Robbins and Freeman are excellent.

Everyone involved must have perfect ""form"". Director, Darabont, must have been at the top of his game when he put this gem together. Of course the actors were excellent; Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins seldom disappoint. The thing that makes this movie exceptional is that Darabont coaxed the best performances out of the supporting actors also. Bob Gunton and Clancy Brown were utterly believable (and bad guys don't come much worse than them).The other essential ingredient for a successful movie is simple: It must have a well thought out plot with a perfect beginning, middle and end.

A classic piece of unforgettable film-making by Frank Darabont,"Why do I want to write the 234th comment on The Shawshank Redemption? I am not sure - almost everything that could be possibly said about it has been said. But like so many other people who wrote comments, I was and am profoundly moved by this simple and eloquent depiction of hope and friendship and redemption.The only other movie I have ever seen that effects me as strongly is To Kill a Mockingbird. Both movies leave me feeling cleaner for having watched them.I didn't intend to see this movie at all: I do not like prison movies and I don't normally watch them. I work at a branch library and one day as I was checking The Shawshank Redemption out to one of our older patrons, she said to me, ""Whenever I feel down or depressed, I check out this movie and watch it and it always makes me feel better."" At the time, I thought that was very strange. One day there was nothing on TV except things I absolutely would not watch under any circumstance or things that I had seen too many times already. I remembered what she said, so I watched it. I have watched it many many times since then and it gets better with every showing.No action, no special effects - just men in prison uniforms talking to each other.The Shawshank Redemption and To Kill a Mockingbird are the best movies I have ever seen. I do not judge it by it's technical merits - I don't really care about that. I have read that Citizen Kane or The Godfather or this or that movie is the best movie ever made.

I had missed it due to being in Europe on an extended business trip when it played first-run, and caught some portions of it a few years later, and then completely sometime following.This was the third or fourth time I'd seen it straight through, and it is one of those very rare films which is as good - maybe even better - on successive viewings.Robbins, Freeman, Gunton, and all of the remaining cast - whether in larger supporting roles or smaller - are outstanding, without a single exception.My friend is a computer whiz, with an IQ of probably 150, and widely-expert expert in this area. But he's so immersed in this realm, that whenever forced to use pen and paper (instead of mouse or keyboard) he does so on about the 5th-grade level. After the film (he had bought the DVD, but had never seen it before) he stated he didn't feel the Robbins character could have pulled-off all the shenanigans with the money, from prison via mail (and perhaps sometimes using a messenger of the warden's) the way the film depicted -- whereas today, if such an inmate had a computer terminal available, it would be more possible.I told him I felt certain the opposite was true. In the era of the story, a very intelligent financially-adept individual - especially a former whiz-kid bank V.P. - could have done what was shown even more effectively and successfully than via computer today, with all the firewalls, and in-house computer nerds any bank has. Someone with both tremendous financial and hacker ability might - but not as easily as Tim did, during a period when signatures and figures on paper and the like were the governing elements.This aspect is one of the most critical and climactic for the story and its very satisfying ending. And Gunton, a tremendous actor who has done many sympathetic characters, presents one of the best performances portraying a truly evil person - more so for the quieter and ""nasty-nice"" elements of this portrayal. He juxtaposes quiet demeanor, often even pious, with completely selfish, vicious, amoral actions, as well as humanly possible, with his performance in this roleThis is a film for which the term ""perfect piece of entertainment"" does not exaggerate.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
A movie worth seeing again and again.,"This movie is one of the few movies that I love to see over and over again. Each time I see it, I learn more and more.  Like figuring out the joke about ""salvation lies within.""  I also learned that the movie is more about Red than it is about Andy.  It is as if Andy was sent there by God to give Red hope and to bring good to what was evil within.  This movie has everything a movie needs.  It makes you laugh, cry, and feel really good, giving you a feeling of hope.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
"Reasonably good...but far too clichéd to be called ""great""","This movie is a fine way to spend 140 minutes, but is by no means a movie of the first rank. The script is far too simplistic, cliché-ridden and predictable. The characters are far too good guy/bad guy dualistic; and for a story purporting to take place over the course of 20 years, there is remarkably little character development. And, just about every really evil character gets his comeuppance, whereas the people we're supposed to be rooting for end up in clover. Hmmmm....Among prison movies, Cool Hand Luke is better--more realistic, and without the obligatory Hollywood feel-good ending. Runaway Train and Papillon are also very good, certainly more interesting. Among inspirational movies, last year's October Sky is a better bet.In a nutshell: tremendously overrated, but certainly worth seeing.",6.0,Anonymous,Drama

A true masterpiece for any film-goer.,"'The Shawshank Redemption' is perhaps one of, if not the, perfect film. Every other ""great film"", or any film for that matter has it's pros and cons. Most motion pictures that are as well received as this have plenty going for it, very few against it. While I feel there are films out there with better pros; the pro to con ratio of 'The Shawshank Redemption' out-stands any other film film ever produced.I can't begin to describe every amazing element of this film. Obviously the performances are exquisite, the directing is exceptional and the score is extraordinary. The cinematography, in particular, struck me. Roger Deakins is a master with light and framing.I will watch this film again and again and remember it as one of the greatest films ever made.

a perfect prison drama,"The Shawshank Redemption, based on the fantastic Stephen King novel, is a moving story about Andy Dufresne, an innocent man charged with the murder of his wife and her lover who is sentenced to 40 years in prison and fights hard to survive, but in prison he forms a rare and close friendship with fellow inmate Ellis 'Red' Redding. The film more or less focuses on the friendship between Andy and Red, played beautifully by Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman, Morgan's deep and moving voice was perfect to describe the closeness of his friendship with Andy. The film had a great happy ending where Andy escaped from the prison after serving almost 20 years, he also managed to expose the prison as there was murder and corruption going on there, Andy moves to a beautiful island abroad and when Red is paroled after serving 40 years in prison he is reunited with Andy, it was a great ending to a beautiful movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama

One of the best movies I've ever seen,"This movie takes you through the life of some inmates of Shawshank prison. A very moving story.One of the best stories I've had the pleasure of seeing in a long time.Normally, I don't go out for these types of movies (sci-fi/classic horror fan). This one really surprised me.I actually didn't see it in the theater, but caught it on TV, then rented the movie. I've since bought it and have actually watched it a few times, which is rare for me to do. I usually watch a movie once, then not again for at least 6 months to a year.This movie will one day be a classic in my mind.Enjoy!",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
A cute and sentimental prison drama?,"Quite frankly, this is a movie of clichés. You want examples, I got examples! ""Some birds are not meant to be caged, their feathers are too bright"" or ""Get busy living, or get busy dying"" or ""Terrible thing, to live in fear"" or ""It was like some beautiful bird flapped into our drab little cage and made those walls dissolve away"" or ""need it so you don't forget. Forget that there are places in the world that aren't made out of stone"" or ""Hope is a good thing, and good things can never die"" - if you say so, sensei!Problem is Stephen King never leaves anything to the imagination. He tells us everything - if Tim Robbins organises some special event for the inmates, like playing music over the loudspeaker, Morgan Freeman's voice will come right out and suggest a few reasons why this episode is so wonderful/significant, the nature of which are very similar through each episode of the movie. And Darabont obviously likes the idea of assuming the audience are very thick, and will not see or experience anything unless you dictate to them what to experience, and has made his movie by it.Also, i'm starting to be wary of Thomas Newman as a composer doing exactly what Darabont has done as a director: employ a formula that has worked in the past. His score for Shawshank is calculated on the same formula of highs, lows, and general atmosphere as in his score for Road to Perdition, American Beauty, Meet Joe Black, Horse Whisperer, Scent of a Woman, and The Green Mile, not surprisingly. If you think about all these movies, they all have a similar feel, they all go for a similar nostalgia, haunting sadness - which admittedly i find very appealing, but i'm starting to worry at how similar they all are.I think encouraging this movie too much is like rewarding someone for employing a formula very successfully - instead of taking risks and doing something edgy that still turns out to be enjoyable and brilliant. Most people do not evaluate movies based on their IMDb ranking, but i certainly would be surprised if any major lists ranked this in their top ten.That said, this is still a good movie, with good performances, a good unity, despite its necessarily episodic nature, and it looks great. Its only for movies people insist on putting on best-ever lists that i require a certain originality, the feeling that what this movie gives you you could not get anywhere else (I believe this is why movies like Citizen Kane, Vertigo, 2001, Raging Bull, Third Man, Grand Illusion, Persona and, for me, Exterminating Angel, are constantly mentioned on such lists, and deservedly). What this movie gave me, I could get from reading any other Stephen King story, or seeing any other movie adaptation of a King story.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama

Very best movie i ever watch,"The story is described by ""Red"" Redding (Morgan Freeman), who has been inside the dividers of Shawshank Prison for quite a while and is its driving business visionary. He can get you whatever you require: cigarettes, confection, even a little shake pick like a beginner geologist may utilize. One day he and his kindred detainees watch the most recent busload of detainees empty, and they make wagers on who will cry amid their first night in jail, and who won't. Red wagers on a tall, slender person named Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), who resembles an innocent bystander.In any case, Andy does not cry, and Red loses the cigarettes he bet. Andy ends up being an amazement to everybody in Shawshank, in light of the fact that inside him is such an intense supply of assurance and quality that nothing appears to break him. Andy was a financier all things considered, and he's in for murder. He's clearly blameless, and there are a wide range of points of interest including his case, yet before long they go up against a sort of illusion; every one of that numbers inside jail is its own general public - who is solid, who is not - and the deliberate section of time.Red is likewise a lifer. Now and again, measuring the decades, he goes up before the parole board, and they measure the length of his term (20 years, 30 years) and inquire as to whether he supposes he has been restored. Goodness, most without a doubt, yes, he answers; however the fire leaves his confirmations as the years walk past, and there is the feeling that he has been standardized - that, similar to another old lifer who murders himself in the wake of being paroled, he can no longer truly imagine life all things considered.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
One of the Greatest Ever,"After watching this movie i was stunned at how great it was. It was the first movie that kept me hooked the whole way through and had everything in it. What made it better was seeing how it was expanded so well from the original short story, which again was very good. How anyone can say it less, must not have been watching it properly. There is nothing to say to criticise the movie, the acting was brilliant, the casting great, and the directing, breath taking. But we can not overlook the great writer who brought this story to life, Steven King. Without having writers like him, we would never have any movies to match up to the likes of Shawshank and Godfather. I am still waiting for another movie to knock it off the top of my top 10 list, however, i am doubtful if this will ever happen.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Credit where credit is due.,"This film is, love it or hate it, flawless. I find myself unable to pick out any one element of this movie that was poorly executed or inconsistent. The Director, Frank Darabont, despite his much-less-than-impressive filmography successfully animates every scene and character in living detail. Whats more is the life and detail he brought to his screenplay.Originally published under Richard Bachman, Stephen King's once-pseudonym, ""Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption"" is one of the most miserable short stories ever hacked out by any desperately uninspired fiction author in history. The book makes no attempt to build or define characters, background, or story progression. It basically apexes around the one scene in the prison theatre where the writer clumsily tries to convey the point of the book: as hopeless as a man's situation is, his dreams and fantasies live on. After King's catharsis he seemingly looses any real interest in his story and apathetically caps it off several pages later.Frank Darabont not only masterfully directed this film but deserves much more credit for crafting 95% of this movie purely from his own imagination and being able to construct a very tangible plot line from complete tripe. Credit where credit's due, Stephen King doesn't even deserve royalties.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama

The Prison Of Storytelling,"A fair number of the movies that rank high on this site's top 250 all time list also share a parallel 'life' as literature, so let's start there.The book ""Rita Hayworth, etc..."" is the best of the 'Different Seasons' tetralogy. King adhered to the first person perspective, which is a challenge: the narrator can only know what comes into his range of perception. You as the reader have to decide if you trust him, and so on. King wrote this in the early hand-to-mouth period of his existence -- and what do we have? A prisoner who persistently writes to his benefactors for 'more funding'.Darabont didn't have the skill necessary to really offer anything of artistic value here. We're stuck with borrowings: parts of ""Convict 99"", ""Gilda"", ""Brubaker"", ""Birdman of Alcatraz""; musically, the ""Marriage of Figaro"" aria -- it's actually not a bad bit of self-reference. It's the only good visual part here, and even that is smothered by the narration; literarily, Dumas' ""...Monte Cristo""...The book does a good job of playing with the readers' expectations and using irony. There's no preaching. And it ends far more intelligently than this does; the denouement here seems to belong in a different movie altogether.This isn't a bad movie; considering the obscene amount of money invested in these things, it's hard to find a truly bad movie any more -- one with no cinematic value at all -- that wasn't the case 20 - 30 years ago.But there's no way I can love it. It just isn't the sort of movie that resonates with *me*, because the story is just 'there' with no life of its own.",3.0,Anonymous,Drama

As succinct as I can be,"Occasionally you go into a cinema and all the films you wanted to see were full. As you've come this far and you're a bit of a film fan you go to see a film you've heard nothing about. I did this 6 years ago, with expectations low and a boredom threshold to match I sat and waited to be disappointed. 2 hours later I walked out of the cinema a different person, before I had not been moved by a film, I didn't care if : Indiana Jones made it, Sonny Corleone got wacked, Fred married Ginger, ET got home. Before, films were either plot driven or character driven, they were action or comedy, sad or happy, a few came along that combined a number of facets that I enjoyed, respected  or challenged how I viewed an issue or a person.Shawshank was different, there were characters I believed, not just one or two but virtually all. Throughout the first hour I was gripped the full range of emotions were explored, the second hour building on the characters was even more powerful, some characters came and went but ultimately this was a story of 2 people: Red and Andy. I have never seen a film that so eloquently and beautifully illustrates friendship and hope.This has become the benchmark by which I judge all movies. I am pleased that I am not alone in feeling this way. I am glad that it did not win oscars as I feel individual endorsement is stronger than any vested interest award ceremony, I relish telling everyone this is my favourite film. I have seen it many times and will see it many more.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Why it's Number 1,"The Shawshank Redemption is a wonderful film. It is one of the best films of 1994. It is one of the better films of the 90's. It most certainly is not one of the best films of all time, and in turn, obviously not the best of all time. I respect those of you who have put it at number one. At least it's better than calling Happy Gilmore number one, but I digress.This is addressed to anyone who wonders how in all the world this film beat The Godfather, Citizen Kane, 2001, and even Pulp Fiction for best film of all time. Each of these films is celebrated, henceforth it is also ""chic"" to bad-mouth these movies. People hear that Citizen Kane is great so often that when someone sees it and is disappointed, they take it personally. Same with Pulp Fiction, so many loved it, that when somebody didn't like it all that much, their dislike becomes hate, relative to the passion some people have for the film.Another prime example is Titanic. Where is it? It's not here on the Top 250. Yet upon its release (and the subsequent months it was out) you almost didn't hear a single negative word about it. Not until the people who were so sick of the raves went, minds already made up to hate it. Some people are so pretentious that they despise anything mainstream. Hence, the backlash against Titanic.Now on to The Shawshank Redemption. The Shawshank Redemption is a film, like Titanic, that I have never heard one uncynical person say a bad thing about. Obviously then, its ratings will be high (well-deserved). However, also working in Shawshank's favor is the fact that it has never gone mainstream. The fact that it tanked at the box office may have been the best thing that happened to it. It never has become cool to knock Shawshank, therefore we rarely have people rating it 1 out of spite. With this lack of poor reviews, it is no wonder Shawshank shot to the top. It is a marvelous little movie, but certainly no Citizen Kane or 2001.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama

"A beautifully crafted tale that underlines subjects that have been forgotten in modern films- friendship,hope, freedom","This film is a modern classic. Why? Because it simply includes everything which builds a great story, and that is all films really are, storytelling.The concept of story telling can very easily be lost and forgotten in an industry that can sell cinema tickets by using special effects and employing world super stars like Tom Cruise. That may well be the easy option, but films that rely on pretty faces and big budgets will never be remembered. It is films like Shawshank that will lodge themselves into people hearts, and will be passed down by many generations.This is because everyone that watches this film becomes a part of it. You are there, in that prison, suffering when Andy does, smiling when Andy does. Tim Robbins plays this part so well it could be classed in one of the best lead parts in a film ever. He is simply superb. Plus, Morgan Freeman, well, would we expect anything less from a man with such talent?It is this relationship, between Andy(Robbins) and Red(Freeman) which really strikes me as a breathe of fresh air, as if i had been hit in the face by a strong wind. We are trapped in a society where relationships only seem meaningful and deep when the two people involved are having sex. Hollywood have molded this preconception that characters with a relationship must sleep together. Shawshank, for once, tells the tale of two men, who by the end of the film have a very strong relationship, but have not gone down the Brokeback mountain road of madness. Their friendship is portrayed free of sex, yet is portrayed so powerfully that you are emotionally taken back by the ending. Personally i nearly cried at a friendship so pure yet so meaningful.The plot is also perfectly timed. I am someone that is usually quite critical if the speed of a film moves too fast or if it drags on. Shawshank gives you a mixture of paces, but also keeps the story turning and turning, as if it has a heart beat, pumping more and more of the story line, unwinding the plot before your open jaw.Another subject i would like to comment on is the swearing. Again, i am normally quite critical of films that have swearing in, just to look cool, or higher the rating. Swearing in that context seems unnatural, and therefore disjointed. However the swearing in Shawshank seemed totally natural, and all part of the atmosphere of the prison.Finally, i think everyone should see this film. This is a pure, yet thrilling tale of hope, friendship and belief. The story is executed brilliantly, with intense characteriztion from both sides of the spectrum- you become Andy, and go through his struggles with him, and you hate the warden and his captain with a passion.I guarantee, by the time those credits gracefully slide up the screen, you jaw will be open, your mind will be blown, and your heart will be broken into pieces. This is a truly unforgettable masterpiece.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama

"A heroic fable, but nothing more.","I found this movie to be rather trivial and predictable.  It was, in many ways, a Forrest Gump version of a prison movie.  It had a manipulative and superficial plotline, and the leading character was too good to be true. It never dealt deeply with any issue at all.  Basically, you liked the leading character because he was perfect, and cheered him on and hoped for his success, just like Forrest Gump.  However, unlike Forrest Gump, I could never see the true emotion of the Tim Robbins character.  He didn't like being sexually assaulted, but we never saw how that affected him; he didn't drink but got beers for his friends.  He finds pleasure out of the simple things and doesn't like unpleasurable things.  He turned out to be a perfect character with no negative qualities at all.  Maybe he's this way for a reason; people can relate to him because they like to think of themselves being completely perfect and think they would make every right decision if they were in a situation like this.In many senses, this was just a morality play, with Andy Dufresne being entirely good and all the prison officials being completely bad.  I think the only reason why people enjoy this movie so much is that it has the message ""Good things come to those that try and do good with their lives."" However, I didn't think the movie had enough substance to offer any deeper meaning or insight.  The best thing about this movie was it made me realize how great of a movie Forrest Gump is and how great of an actor Tom Hanks is. He made the Forrest Gump character seem to have a fully round personality and allowed us to understand who he was.  He seemed possible.  Andy seems unlikely and not relatable because we never see any reasoning behind his personality.This movie moves people because it is a heroic fable.  It's not a worthless movie experience, but it should have done more with what it already had. To the people that think this is the greatest movie ever made...spare me.

It was in college that i got to see some fine Hollywood films and this one was probably the finest of the lot. This film at first appears to be a story about life in prison.

The screenplay is ably supported by Morgan Freeman's brilliant narration offering a second-person view of life in shawshank.

Must watch movie!!!!,Shawshank Redemption!!!! First time when I heard this name I had no idea what Shawshank is all about. I must accept the fact that I was not fascinated by its name but luckily I managed to see this movie. This movie is awesome it will fill you with hope when you start loosing hope at some point of time in your life. That's the power of this movie. I have seen this movie maximum number of times as I have not seen others. Story goes this way:A man who was wrongly convicted murder of his wife and her lover. He got two life sentences back to back. He felt that he might not be proved good husband but he was not a murderer so he started planning to dig the tunnel to be free from this. The way he dig the tunnel and the person who helped him in his project was the crux of this movie. So it was his hope that was kept deep inside his heart that provide such a power to escape from the Shawshank.Please rent the DVD and watch it. you will surely find it most amazing movie as you have ever witness.,10.0,Anonymous,Drama
An excellent film contained within a classic,"When I first saw the Shawshank Redemption, I was in a movie theater on a week night at around 11pm. I had gotten out of work from working the evening shift. I was tired and just wanted a little amusement. This was at a time after Shawshank had been released but got little attention. I had heard some Oscar buzz so my curiosity got the better of me. I half reluctantly chose to watch it. That night, I was not prepared to be blown away. I didn't see a movie, I was transported by a story. I was instantly transcended into realizing why films should be made to begin with. I wasn't just entertained, I was emotionally moved and intellectually bamboozled in the most endearing manner. If this film remains on IMDb's number one spot for a long time to come, It's well deserves it. To me personally, the Shawshank Redemption is a testament as to why the 90's were an interesting decade but more than that, why a film can become an experience and gain instant classic status. There are two simple rules you should follow prior to watching T S R: one, if you haven't seen it, don't let any one who HAS seen it tell you anything about its plot, Don't listen to a word caus they might ruin it for you. Two, make arrangements not to be interrupted when watching the film; no phone calls, no door bells, no other plans. Watch it from beginning to end. You can't over hype this film it's just that good. What i've written here is just a small fraction of what I can further express by way of praise for the film. Long live The Shawshank Redemption on IMDb !",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
what a great movie!,"in my opinion ,it's better than the ordinary Monte Cristo story that we all know as the greatest escape tale , so this time the escape is greater! and the hero is an ordinary man , who is so patient and hopeful, while you watch the first few minutes of the film you may think that it's social or silly story, but minute by minute you will recognize that you were wrong, it's a Brilliant Story,a never seen before , a very powerful drama .. the best thing in that movie was the relations between characters,like hating,and true friendship like the one which was between Tim Robins and Morgan Freeman,I like this movie and i advice every one on the planet to watch it as soon as possible....",10.0,Anonymous,Drama

"Review of ""The Shawshank Redemption""","What to say about the ""Shawshank Redemption""? I shouldn't really have to say anything because when most people hear about it, they already have a pretty good idea of how incredible it is. This movie is freakin' immaculate. Darabont and Co. have created not only the most inspiring film in ages, but one of the most emotionally significant films to date. The movie teaches things to us that we need to know - messages on hope, perseverance, and friendship - and it does it with marvelous eloquency. All in all, ""The Shawshank Redemption"" remains one of the most spectacular films I have ever seen - a master piece of art. Perfect.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
"Above average, but not great.","While the acting is rather good, not all performances are flawless, nor matched with each other as well as they could be (see Godfather 1 and 2, Goodfella's, even Pulp Fiction for near flawless ensemble acting in films).The film works but is a multi-derivative film, borrowing similar characters from several films and fashioning a film of fairly corny and unbelievable melodramatic moments to ultimately preach a message of hope.While it's an entertaining film, it's not a very good film at all.  It's strongest moments are borrowed from prison films as far back as 1930's Up the River which starred Spencer Tracy and Humphrey Bogart (in his second role).   While Shawshank is superior overall than some of the film it borrows from, it does not go any place other films have not already been before.  While at times it borders on being brutal, it still is completely done with a rose colored glasses sensibility.  Were it to more accurately portray any semblance of what the situation would be like it would be at times very difficult to watch and emotionally exhausting--which this film is not.I am rather surprised it has received such high praise from so many.  I suppose if voters would see films such as Attica, Breaker Morant, Brubaker, Cool Hand Luke, Cry Danger, The Glass House, Papillon, Pressure Point (1962), Riot in Cellblock 11, Short Eyes, and Yol for starters (films which concern men who are prisoners), they would realize how much of this film is borrowed from prior films.",6.0,Anonymous,Drama
Mystifyingly adored piece of melodrama,"That this film ranks as No2 in the 'all time' list on IMDB says a lot for how folks don't watch films from any era before the 90s anymore, for how else could it genuinely sit atop that list? I suppose in an age where everything on amazon gets at least four stars, good subjective criticism is proving harder and harder to find...but really...is this film better than Chinatown? Better than Casablanca? The Third Man? Mean Streets? Withnail and I? Better than Adam's Rib, Singin' in the Rain, Rear Window, Day for Night, Bande a Part, Taxi Driver, West Side Story, Les Quatre Cent Coups, Some Like it Hot, Seven Samurai?I've seen this film twice, once at the cinema and once on TV as I lie stuffed with Xmas dinner. The first time was mildly enjoyable, the second pretty turgid. Despite the presence of the ever excellent Robbins (though Morgan Freeman phones in the same performance he's given in every film ever since), this film never transcends the humble source of its story - a Stephen King short - and whilst it's a 'nice' tale with a reasonable twist at the end, can anyone else explain to me why such praise has been heaped on this utterly average experience?And it's not just IMDB. A recent UK Channel Four poll found Shawshank right up there. Perhaps it's the combination of pseudo-harsh prison story and a buddy tale along with the lashings of on the nose humanism that appeals across genders and other boundaries. I don't know. But believe me, if this were the 2nd best film ever made in the world ever, let's just say cinema wouldn't be the popular influence it is today.Go out there, people. Find the true 'classics', find the films this piece of sentimentalia stole its every beat, every note, every word of dialogue from.

A fantastic story which touches the inner-most of the body,"I felt a sudden need to create an account on the web. Why? I do not know. Having never written any movie review, I sometime wonder why I felt a need to use a regular Friday night doing so. But then I ask myself: Do there really have to be a purpose? Maybe not.The first time I watched The Shawshank Redemption were a couple of years ago. I had looked up the evening's TV program and I stumbled across the movie title. Not really expecting anything out from the film's summary, I sat down on this evening and watched it. And did it move me. I was completely blown away by everything which the film contained: The acting, the environment, the music - and the story. The ladder plays an important role in the movie. Why? Because in short, the film is about a man who is wrongfully charged for murder, and the next many years in which he spends inside prison. But there is something more to it. The story is so well polished, constructed and so well told, that you wonder about what was done in the process of creating the movie, which could have made it so moving and so heart-touching. Because really, it is all the details and the finesse of the movie, which takes the film to a higher level than any other film which are told through storytelling.Throughout the 130 minutes of the film, you will be witness to fantastic all around acting, particularly from Morgan Freeman who does a hell of a job working as the story teller. With the film starting out slowly, it smoothly starts to work towards the second half of the film, where the film really starts to touch your soul. The ending of the Shawshank Redemption is one of the best on film ever made, I dare say that.I could continue endlessly naming the goods of the film, but there is simply too much. In the end it is hard to point out what makes the Shawshank Redemption so much better than everything else which you have ever seen. My advice is: Buy the film and watch it - you will not be disappointed.I hope...",10.0,Anonymous,Drama

One of the best films ever made.,"The Shawshank Redemption is an example of magical film-making at its best. When I say best, I really mean it. There are a lot of great films out there, and a lot that make me glad I saw them. But Shawshank is, above all of them, at the top of the list.I love this film. Every time any part of it appears on TNT I stay to watch until the end. I just got the DVD on New Years Eve and watched the whole thing through until 12:34 am. It was the most enjoyable thing I could have watched that night.Every part of the story is engrossing from the very first scene. The film has a way about itself that is uniquely its own. From the way it is shot to the musical score (a masterpiece by Thomas Newman).Any film enthusiast, writer, storyteller, actor, or human being must watch this film. It is masterfully executed from one scene to the next, pristinely edited, and in so many words...perfect. I myself am a filmmaker and have hard time watching even great films without judging what I consider mistakes scene-by-scene. Shawshank pulls me out of that awareness and into a wonderful story and I have watched again and again. It never stops being great.As a writer or storyteller I have the utmost respect for Mr. Daramont as well as Mr. King. The dialog throughout the film is understated and magnificent. There are more than half a dozen classic, memorable scenes that I consider iconic from this film. And to top it off, the performances from all the actors, specifically Mr. Freeman and Mr. Robbins, are timeless.If you have not seen The Shawshank Redemption please make a point to make sure you do at some point soon.

A prison drama starring Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman.,"My favorite movie ever.  These are words that basically describe how I feel about this movie.  A prison drama does not sound like an entertaining movie, but this is very entertaining.  Tim Robbins (The Player, I.Q.) stars as Andy Dufresne a smart man convicted of killing his wife and her lover.  He arrives at Shawshank prison completely out of place, but adapts and becomes best friends with one of the prison's head convicts, wonderfully played by Morgan Freeman (Driving Miss Daisy, Seven).  Soon the warden, played by Bob Gunton (Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil, Broken Arrow), enlists his help as a banker, to help with getting some extra (illegal) money and other things.  It doesn't sound like a great movie, but trust me this is the best movie I've ever seen, and everyone I know liked it.  Tim Robbins is great in the lead.  Bob Gunton is good as the twisted warden.  William Sadler (Solo, Die Hard 2) is solid as a fellow convict.  Clancy Brown (Starship Troopers, Highlander) is excellent as the sadistic head of the guards.  Finally, James Whitmore (The Relic) and Gil Bellows (Snow White: A tale of terror) give the best supporting performances as fellow convicts.  A must see.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama

But he isn't alone; he is joined by fellow inmate (who is the only guilty person in Shawshank) Red played also very well by Morgan Freeman.

Three tales of hope,"I think that the Shawshank Redemption is one of the best movies ever made. The acting is crisp and full of endless tension, sometimes forlorn and on other occasions full of fear. How Stephen King could come up with a horror story like this is beyond me. It's a real nightmare to be in a penal system with so many things going against you. Personally, I think that Forrest Gump (FG) is also a tale of Hope, but in a different sense. Firstly, FG shows the hope of waiting for the woman you love for over 20 years. Secondly, FG shows that there can be hope for mentally disabled people to continue in society and aim for goals. I think that both movies are great and should not be missed or inappropiately criticised. I also urge people to watch La Vita e bella (Life is beautiful) as it is as good as The Shawshank Redemption and has some similar points. May we all hope for more movies like these.PS Also watch It's a Wonderful Life (James Stewart) as this is about hope as well.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama

Why film beats books,"The Count of Monte Cristo isn't a very good book, and has spawned a few pretty poor films, but it's the ideas which make it an enduring story. Now whether Stephen King was consciously inspired by Dumas's (""Dumass's"") book when writing the original short story I don't know - what I do know is that Frank Darabont took a dour, typically coarsely-detailed potboiler and evolved it into something special. The big step for me, was that having taken an interesting idea and made it good, Darabont then found an ensemble cast and a cinematographer who could make it sing. I don't think there's a dull line of dialogue in the movie, and barely a camera shot either out of place or wasted. Why it is that equally talented filmmakers can spend millions and produce the kind of mindless gibberish which actually wins Oscars (like 'Braveheart' did in the year 'Shawshank Redemption' was nominated) I'll truly never fathom. Maybe there should be another way of formally recognising talent: wait ten years then take a vote - that way the mindless and the popular will have time to find their level and what's left is worth remembering.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama

My favorite movie was The Godfather until I saw The Shawshank Redemption.,"My favorite movie was really The Godfather until I saw The Shawshank Redemption.A lot of people would might disagree with, but I love this movie. the actors are great, the director has done a fantastic job and the screenplay is magnificent.I was so impressed with how every single subplot was given a great deal of respect and attention from the director. The acting was world-class. I have never seen Tim Robbins act as well since, Morgan Freeman maybe (e.g. Seven). The twists were unexpected, an although this film had a familiar feel, it wasn't even slightly pretentious or clichéd, it was original. The cinematography was grand and expressive. It gave a real impression of the sheer magnitude of this daunting prison.I remember, when i saw the movie I didn't want to get up and go to the toilet. When I finally was done in the bathroom, I couldn't wait to get back and press play on my DVD. At the time I was done with the movie I wanted to see the movie again.This film manages to redeem Hollywood in the eyes of people who feared it long lost in a dark sea of clichés and predictability. Darabont shows us that artists still work in the Hollywood studios and production facilities. These artists show their capability to produce art; real art that inspires you to look at the deeper aspects of life and the world around you. The Shawshank Redemption delivers much-needed breath of fresh air for anyone who realizes the capability of film. It proves that masters of the craft still live on this earth, and still bless us with timeless masterpieces that we will never forget.So see it, buy it, love it.",8.0,Anonymous,Drama
9 on a scale of 10,"Ok, as I give this movie a 9, it is going to be hard to be critical, but I feel as though that is the responsibility of anyone who doesn't rate a movie a 10.First of all, the acting was sensational - as good as I have seen in a long time. The direction was great and the script was great. And, it turned into (unexpectedly) a true buddy story.I could only criticize a couple things - one of which was NOT the length - 2:20. I found it a little troubling that most of the criminals were extremely nice guys - except for the obligatory bad guys in the shower. I also have to confess a real distaste for the homosexual overtones - especially early on. But, then what prison movie attempting to depict real life could leave that out???Also, prison movies in the 1940's, 1950's and 1960's are not my favorite genre, however one of the advantages of prison movies are that you really don't care very much what period it takes place in.

Like the scene when Andy plays Mozart or the scene on the roof. Critics might choose others, but there's no other movie touched my soul like this one, and I've seen thousands of them.

A cinematic phenomenon,"What can I possibly add to a review corpus of over 1.2 million ratings and three thousand reviews? This movie has been called ""one of the best movies of all time"", ""a powerful story about friendship, hope and freedom"" and a ""latter-day retelling of the Gospel story"". Many people have seen this movie multiple times, and some claim it has changed their lives and even saved their lives.At this point, I'm rather more interested in the phenomenon than the movie. My take on it: this movie appeals enormously to ordinary people (especially American men) who feel trapped by difficult situations in their lives. Some may be looking to be rescued, like Red was; others may take comfort in the thought that their long-term pain, tedium and oppression will someday result in a spectacular liberating event. This movie satisfyingly scratches that annoying itch called ""life is unfair"".It's difficult to know what to think about all this. Whatever you think about the phenomenon, ""Shawshank Redemption"" is also just a good movie with excellent writing, black and white characters, a simple but satisfying plot with a few surprising scenes, great acting, and a certain amount of tear jerking.

A gritty look at prison. One of the best prison movies ever.,"This movie I'm not going to call this film the IMDb #1 movie, but I really can't deny that this is fantastic. The cast, the score, the writing, and the power are all here in this film, and filled with strength. It's one of those movies that you will continue to think about even after the film is over. It is about a friendship, a life, an evil, and a hope. A hope that is considered in many ways to be bridge to insanity inside the prison walls. We see these people as years of time goes by. We see friendships grow, and topics change. It really puts you in the prison, and makes you feel what's like to behind those bars. You feel the friendship, the hope, the darkness, and the pure horror of it all.4 stars out of 4",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Probably Not #1,"Whilst the IMDb users may disagree, the Shawshank Redemption isn't my number 1, maybe not even my top 100. But with that said, I have seen this movie a few hundred times and it gets wary. There is no doubt it is good, I may even say it's close to great and it has a pretty good watchability rating, but it's forced metaphors get on my nerves now and, in reality, is just another prison movie which is above average.Boring if you have seen it a few times, but for a first impression it is good. Once you start to analyze its elements you can begin to see the film for what it is. A perfect film it is not, but the acting is near perfect and the realism is somewhat accurate. Not my favorite film, not my favorite prison film, but give it a whirl and see how you decide.",8.0,Anonymous,Drama

Faithful Story Telling,"Stephen King was surely pleased to see one of his works faithfully represented on-screen.

An epic movie of pure brilliance!,"This film is a truly awesome film once i had started watching the first 10 minutes of it i was addicted to the TV and could do nothing but to watch it. This story is about a respectable banker (Andy Duframe) who is sentenced to Shawshank prison for life imprisonment for a crime he did not commit. Once he arrives at Shawshank he soon starts to learn that the prison mentally takes your life. However, Andy seems very unusual being very quite and polite around the prison. At the spectacular climax at the end of this film it just gives the viewer such an amazing feeling of hope and in my opinion this is the best film every made.

"Flawless filmmaking, deserves all the credit it receives and then some","I always really enjoyed The Shawshank Redemption and my appreciation remains consistent with repeated viewings. With a 9.3 IMDB rating decades after it's release shows that this is a movie that speaks to people and I have not met anyone who doesn't like this movie. Among Steven King adaptations this is probably the best, I like Stanley Kubrick's The Shining, just as much for different reasons. But don't tell Steven King that, lol. The Shawshank Redemption is much more than a prison movie, it's an absolutely engrossing movie that has audiences glued to the screen from start to finish. Director Frank Darabond did a fantastic job putting this together with top notch cinematography, direction and a great attention to detail.

An enduring testament to the human spirit,"The great Morgan Freeman continues to spin out superlative performances. This is one of his finest, a difficult and complex portrayal of a veteran convict, who is so long a part of the numbing prison culture that we're somewhat surprised by his sympathetic understanding of the unfortunate Andy DuFresne, movingly interpreted by Tim Robbins. People are in prison, for the most part, because they belong there. Prisoners don't normally exude compassion for their fellow unfortunates, but Freeman's ""Red"" noticed right away that DuFresne was of different stuff. Their friendship cut across both racial and social lines, and that it was forged in the furnace of a prison conducted by so corrupt a warden as Norton, was a magnificent testimony to their bond. Clancy Brown as the warden's personal storm trooper could have been reduced to caricature, but he turned this difficult role into a memorable portrayal of mindless violence. The great revelation in this film was Bob Gunton as the warden. There has rarely been, if ever in film, a keener reading of a character given the charge of men who've been reviled by society, and thus forgotten and who are totally dependent upon his good will for their very survival. Norton was the essential bureaucrat who, given sufficient backing from an indifferent public, can build from the foundations up, a system which brutalizes and murders men, and which exploits the last vestiges of their self-respect for his personal ends. The narration by Freeman in his great baritone lent an authentic base line for the kaleidoscopic unfolding of the film. James Whitmore's poignant turn as a man doomed to death outside of prison is proof of what lengthy incarceration to do to a man, turning him into a slave who is addicted to the very structure which denies his humanity. That both DuFrense and ""Red"" each managed to leap over the abysses which yawned before them, was the great cathartic experience of the film.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama

The Greatest Movie Ever Made?,"Every time I watch The Shawshank Redemption it reinforces the fact that it is my favorite movie of all time. But certainly as entertaining a film that it is, being a personal favorite does not necessarily make it a great film or dare I saythe greatest film ever made.But what then makes a film great? First and foremost, if it sets out to entertain the general public, it must do that (and Shawshank certainly does that). Its pure entertainment value is essentially a stipulation in its inclusion in the great IMDb ""greatest movie"" debate. The serious nature of its central plot pointsa wrongly convicted murderer who assists the corrupt warden as means to affect his own escapeis contrasted by some truly funny scenes. Although by no means a comedy, the splendid screenplay is wrought with witty dialog. There's nothing fancy about this filmno special effects, spectacular scenery or even a bunch of pretty women. No, its just the telling of a story, mostly through the narration of Morgan Freeman's character, Red, that almost lulls viewers into believing that nothing really interesting or important is going to happen here. But after all of the subtle plot twists I think what makes this film great for me is I feel like I'm actually sharing in Andy's redemption. Now if that isn't what they teach in Film-making 101 then they should just close up the classroom.Ultimately, there cannot be a single motion picture that is the ""greatest film of all time"" because as art, and in an art form as varied as cinema, greatness must be measured by each individual. Greatness, as beauty, truly is in the eye of the beholder. But in this beholder's eyes I think The Shawshank Redemption is truly the greatest film I have ever seen.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama

A great film of a helping hand leading to end-around justice,"It shouldn't be lost on anyone that well into the 21st century, ""The Shawshank Redemption"" has been the No. 1 film, or close to the top for years among movie viewers who have rated movies on IMDb. With more than 2.4 million ratings just on this film alone, it's probably safe to say that it would stay close to its top spot in any public survey.What a great film the Shawshank Redemption is. Even though thousands have written reviews already, a little should yet be said about great films that don't win the awards or become big box office hits, but become highly popular mostly for their story. That usually is a matter of justice, within the story itself, and for the film having been made. And, justice is the undergirding theme of this film.For anyone who hasn't seen the film, the conclusion is a real surprise. And it brings to closure all of the angst and apprehension and concern one has about the wrong treatment of the hero, Andy Dufresne, played by Tim Robbins. The narrative format adds to a sense of the drama and reality of a story as told by Red Redding, played by Morgan Freeman. One wants so badly to see an innocent man exonerated of the crime for which he was convicted. While the circumstances of the plot make that impossible, the alternative ending serves justice to the hilt. Because, in this way, justice is served on those who abused their power. The warden and guard commander couldn't be convicted for that, but in their evil ways they were open to other law violations for which they could be taken downSo, the ending satisfies justice and the hearts of so many viewers. It is reminiscent of a true story of a true gangster. The big-time gangster of the prohibition era, Al Capone, could never be caught and prosecuted for so many crimes he committed, including murder. But the federal government was finally able to convict him for income tax evasion which led to his imprisonment.Here's a film that didn't even cover its costs at the box office when first released, and took a re-release to earn a modest sum. Yet it remains a favorite, far above many films that have won multiple academy awards over the years. While the cast all are very good, and the production qualities first rate, it's the story - the plot with a superb screenplay that makes this a great film.While this movie was based on a 1982 story by Stephen King, a big piece of the plot was not an original idea. Either Stephen King and/or Director Frank Darabont, may have gotten the idea from an earlier movie, for prisoner Andy Dufresne helping the warden and guards with their taxes and money laundering schemes, and then the law catching up with the crooked prison officials at the end. Both of these situations were first part of a 1968 movie, ""Hot Millions,"" although they were just a small aside in the plot of that caper comedy. That film starred Peter Ustinov, Maggie Smith, Karl Malden, Bob Newhart and Robert Morley. In it, Ustinov plays Marcus Pendleton, who was serving time in a British prison for embezzlement. Just before leaving prison, Marcus finishes the prison governor's income tax report - saving him about 500 pounds sterling for the year. Later he sees a headline in a newspaper stand that a prison governor was arrested for tax fraud.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama

Phenomenal Movie!,"The Shawshank Redemption is one of the most touching and greatest movies I have ever seen. The movie is based on the novella Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption by Stephen King. Unlike most of his novels King didn't write a horror story but instead a inspiring tale of hope in unlikely places. Overseeing the transition from book to big screen is Frank Darabont who in his director debut scores a home run with this movie.Not only does the plot pull you in but the actors do as well. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman do a fantastic job as the 2 central characters and as friends. Bob Gunton is great in the part of the villain as the evil warden. The directing, cast, and plot all combine to make the movie awesome.The plot of the movie revolves around Andy Dufresne a man who is imprisoned for life for a crime he did not commit. Over time Andy becomes friends with Red an inmate who runs the business of smuggling in things into the prison. The story then follows the 2 and how they handle prison life.Years go by but Andy continues to speak of hope.

"""There's something inside they can't touch.""","Let me review this film on two aspects: it's merit and it's high placement.First of all, ask yourself this question: Is a film great simply because it achieves? I hope many think this is not the case. Shawshank has a slow and methodical pace. Along with good performances around the board. The simple staging and lighting of the film is over-done in it's simplicity and I personally see no art in it at all. But, I'm not saying it's a bad film. It's not, and it's far from it. But to be ranked over vastly more intelligent efforts is a sad reflection on our society.The writing is top-notch. The best thing about the film is the flow of the story, and I could have simply read a book. I am no huge fan of visual effects or quick paced story-telling ... but I am a fan of art. Reading a book would be as enthralling as watching this film. Seeing the acting is like watching lines being delivered, but being delivered well.As for it's rating on the site ... the film pushes no boundaries in which film often offends people to the point of disliking it. It has a nice uplifting story at the end and presses a lot of hot buttons. Including murder, infidelity, and scandal.Searching for the soundtrack for this film is what brought me to IMDb for the first time, actually. So I dare not say this is a bad film; I only say it's ranked higher than vastly superior films.Rating: C+",7.0,Anonymous,Drama

get busy living or get busy dying,"In short supply are the movies which act as cathartic catalysts on a second –or-plus viewing as compellingly and strongly as on the first viewing. The other night, overpowered by feelings of despondency and ennui, I went to flick through my small collection of movies and on an impulse I picked up The Shawshank Redemption. I savored every moment of the movie even more than my first time a couple of years ago. I chalk it up to its beautifully crafted story, its virtuoso and powerhouse performances, and its underlying themes of hope, resolve, and ultimate salvation. This time, in his feature directorial debut Frank Darabont has tapped into the wellspring of King the horrible's and fashioned a juggernaut of a prison drama out of his novella Rita Hayworth and the shawshank Redemption. This movie stands out among other prison flicks in that it flies in the face of conventions. Contrary to our expectations and cheapened tastes, Shawshank does not intend to explore the horrors of prison life as its fulcrum but the way its inhabitants clutch at straws and pull out all stops to extricate themselves from the shackles of the gloom of their claustrophobic mental incarceration against all the odds turns out to be its thematic pull. And the movie pulls it off big time. Among a mosaic of characters, events, shenanigans and skullduggery, the movie mainly delves into the friendship struck up between two lifers. The friendship between Andy Dufresne, played convincingly by Tim Robbins, who is accused of murdering his wife and her lover and sentenced to serve two concurrent lives, and the veteran Red, the brilliant Morgan Freeman, carries the emotional and inspirational mood of the movie. When a busload of prisoners arrive at the max-security state penitentiary of Shawshank, the other felons bet on who is going to burst into tears at the first night of prison life. Red ups his antes on the seemingly brittle fresh fish Andy, who was a respectable banker in the outside and is like a fish out of water among a bunch of thick-skinned miscreants. Red loses since Andy turns out to be more redoubtable and impermeable than any prison wall several feet thick. Little do the fellow prisoners realize at first glance what an enigmatic character he is. For the first months he says next to nothing, meanders through other prisoners in the prison yard minding his own business and the movie speaks through by-turn humorous, poignant and thought-provoking narration of the omniscient Red who is known for smuggling things in and charging a 20% markup for the services he provides. However, Red's omniscience is not all-encompassing and Godly enough to bore into the Sphinx-like mind of the introverted Andy even after 19 years. On a tarring occasion, he overhears a guard complaining about the taxes he has to pay for an inheritance, he screws up his courage to offer him his expert advice on tax evasion. Now, he is treated as a special guest since he cooks the books for the prisons' powers that be who have hit pay dirt. His financial legerdemain proves to be a double-edged sword. Now he is the victim of his own success. A newcomer is willing to testify to his innocence in the court but the warden regards his accountant too valuable to be expendable. Andy survives several assaults and rapes. He never gives up. He never cracks under pressure. Life is very simple to him: get busy living or get busy dying. He makes the first choice and remains true to it through thick and thin. He lives with hope as his source of salvation. The emotional pull of the movie owes a great deal to the spirited and flawless performances of all the cast members. Morgan Freeman effortlessly inhabits his character as a real free man. Tim Robbins is superlative as a quintessential embodiment of hope and inspiration. James Whitmore, as the institutionalized prison trusty who is suicidal in the outside, turns in a superlative performance. Hats off to all the performers. The Shawshank Redemption is a prime example of the gap between the box office performance of a movie and its popularity. This movie famously bombed in the box office, barely covering its budget. But overtime it gained in such popularity that it has snatched the coveted toppest ranking place in IMDb from such hot favorites and topdogs like Godfather, Forrest Gump and Pulp Fiction, the last two of which eclipsed Shawshank in 1994 Academy Awards. Perhaps in 1994 the movie lacked the requisite word of mouth that it is enjoying now. All in all, Shawshank is a compulsively watchable movie with bits of pleasure withheld in every watching only to be relished on next occasions.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama

It is truly a testament to the spirit of man and how each one of us handles what life throws at us in our own way.  If you are feeling down, give it a watch and it's hard not to be inspired.

Not Just Another Prison Film......,"I was at the video store with my girlfriend and we wanted to rent out a few movies. I decided that one of the films we should rent out is 'The Shawshank Redemption'. I had always wondered why it had such good ratings as well as being positioned at #2 in the IMDb Top 250, and I thought I would see just how good the movie really was.When the film concluded in a way that I would have never conceded, I sat there in front of the TV surprised and dumbfounded. When my girlfriend asked me what was wrong, I simply just said ""That....is the greatest movie I have ever seen in my entire life."" It was not just an ordinary and clichéd film I was watching, it was art on the screen, 2 and a half hours of extraordinary cinematography, unforgettable acting, and a plot so compelling, that you just did not want it to end. Morgan Freeman as Red and Tim Robbins as Andy are the perfect choices for their respective roles. The prison setting is so daunting and visually satisfying, while the corruption by the warden and the guards is dreadfully brutal yet extraordinarily eye popping. I normally dislike some movies that normally go for over 2 hours as I think they are just dragging on, but Shawshank along with very few others kept me glued to the screen in suspense. I hung onto every scene and every word uttered in the entire film.'The Shawshank Redemption' is unique in its own little way, and it has affirmed my belief that hope and courage through adversity is possible and rewarding. Not many movies are made like this, and I just hope that there is a movie like, but probably not as good as, 'The Shawshank Redemption' that will be made in this hostile and cruel 21st Century. Movies like this really change lives.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Greatest Film of All Time,"I've lost count of the number of times I have seen this movie, but it is more than 20. It has to be one of the best movies ever made. It made me take notice Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins like I had never noticed any actors before.Is this the greatest film of all time? IMDb would have you believe so. Despite being a box office flop (that barely recouped its budget), the film received multiple award nominations and outstanding reviews from critics for its acting, story, and realism. It has since been successful on cable television, VHS, DVD, and Blu-ray.And it deserves this praise that seems to be growing each year. Now twenty years old, the film has not aged a day, and instead seems to be getting better. This is Tim Robbins' best role, and a fine performance from the always wonderful Morgan Freeman.Not everything Stephen King has written that gets turned into a movie comes out well, but this is as close to perfection as it gets and has everything you could ever want in a movie.Something that is outstanding is the fact that it has no real action, no special effects and no gimmicks. 99% of the movie is just men in a prison uniforms talking. Yet it absolutely hooks you almost from the beginning and has you glued to the screen to the end.For me what really makes this film one of the best is the message of eternal hope it conveys throughout. The never ever give up hope attitude of the main character so well conveyed by Tim Robbins. The ending is just spine tingling every time I see it, no matter how many times I have seen it.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
"So good, I watched it without the sound!","I'm a big Stephen King fan, and I wondered if this movie would be a good adaptation. Some of King's work has been great on film, but others have not translated well. No fear. As others have noted, this is an amazing film that provides inspiration and reconnects the viewer with the inner core of humanity. The script is great, the directing is wonderful, and the performances are unbelievably good. To give you some idea of just HOW GOOD this is, the first time I saw it was on an airline. Problem was, the headset didn't work and there weren't any other headsets. The movie is so good that I couldn't stop watching it--and this is a movie heavy on dialogue.

The brightest representative of overrated cinema,"I'm not saying that Shawshank Redemption is a bad movie, in some ways it's perfect. The storytelling is seamless and unquestionable, the characters are bright and strong. Villains with motivation. Heroes are not idiots. Events are justified by circumstances that push the heroes to independent actions. But my God, there are so many films that are so many times more worth your time and emotional energy that Shawshank Redemption is a quiet and meditative movie that is hard to watch at times. It's impossible for me personally to worry about characters that look so fake and created specifically for this story. They cannot be imagined in other circumstances, outside the picture. The lack of deep meanings and the possibility of different interpretations of the characters and what is happening is annoying.

Must have something to do with the direction of Frank Darabont. And the acting of the stars is just brilliant. As a matter of fact, I don't see Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins playing just another role. I only see two Persons: Andy and Red For a long time I had the problem that when I saw Tim Robbins in another movie I thought of Andy Dufresne But now I will write something about the story: Of course I have read the original story written by Stephen King. It was, in a way different. It has not that deep meaning that is perceptible in the movie. When I think about this friendship between the two men...

Best Movie Of The Era,"To be brief, as a man who has watched thousands of movies in my life, Shawshank redemption is the best movie I have ever seen. The plot, the way it develops, the acting, the portrayal of every human emotion, and the ending makes 99% of movies seem like just a waste of time. I didn't see it until a few years after it came out. My sister said it was a great movie. It was on HBO, so I watched it. I was speechless. I have always found it strange that it was from a Steven King novel.

In the conversation,"A couple of 'bests' for this film; the best King adaptation ahead of Misery and Stand by Me, and in the conversation for one of the best films of all time.Shawshank has stood the test of time since the sacrilegious Oscars debacle of 1995. Two films should have beaten Forrest and it is line ball between Pulp Fiction and Andy Dufresne's epic prison sentence.Robbins and Freeman have never been better as Andy and Red, whose non-sexual love story is the unique difference that sets the film apart from the usual prison movie cliches.It can be hokey, too long by 30 minutes, and perhaps even a bit preachy.

"How would you define ""human""?","You'd certainly have to be over a certain age to watch this movie. Not because it contains small amounts of very realistic and believable violence (kids are used to that nowadays) but very much so because of the psychological impact it could have. Forget horror ... if I was a kid and had seen this movie it would completely alter my perception of humanity, given I would understand it. Once beyond that certain age this movie will impress you, to say the least.Shawshank Redemption places a man in the wrong place, at the wrong time (early 1900's) and in the worst kind of scenario. He's convicted of the murder of his wife and sentenced to life imprisonment. This is how the movie starts. From this point on the majority of the scenes will take place in the Shawshank Prison Facility.Logicly, as a viewer, you side for the Andy Dufresne (beautifly interpreted by Tim Robbins). It doesn't really matter whether you think he did it or not ... he's stuck in there and it looks like he'll be there for a while. Friendships are born and enemies are made, as you would expect. The way this movie maintains a thrilling storyline describing the friendships, however, is stunning. At the receiving end of one of those friendships is 'Red' Redding (Morgen Freeman), a fellow inmate. 'Red' can get you anything and as Andy, 'Red' is serving a life sentence. Let's just say they have the time to get to know each other, learn from each other and eventually save each other.Because of the limited scenery the story and acting performance gets all the attention it deserves. If I had to condense this movie into a few words, ""intelligence, justice, friendship, being human, redemption"" would all sound like understatements. Saying anything more about this masterpiece would spoil your viewing experience. It's just one you'll have to watch if you love movies.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Very well but far from a masterpiece,"Strong, meaningful and everlasting message is what makes this movie such powerful. The Hope, the Life and the Friendship are elements of Great Impact and are well incorporated in this feature. But, lots of flaws also. This movie lacks originality. Approach, characters and dialogues are rather cliched and mold. Portraying of characters is loose and poor. Dialogues are pretty ordinary and too conventional. Overall approach is just Routine and  the whole movie is based on the Final Impact of  the story. In short, its actually not surprising no Oscar winning and no including into the 100 Greatest Movies by American Film Institute. Greater Effort in developing characters to be multidimensional and story to be less conventional would produce One of the Best. Pity. 7,5/10",7.0,Anonymous,Drama
I just love this movie,"The story begins with the trial of a young banker, Andy Dufrense, victimized by circumstantial evidence, resulting in a conviction for the murder of his wife and her lover. After a quick conviction, Andy finds himself serving a life sentence at Shawshank prison, with no hope of parole. He exists in this prison only in appearance, keeping his mind free from the drab walls around him. His ability to do this results in the gaining of respect from his fellow inmates, but most of all from Ellis Redding. Ellis, commonly referred to as Red, finds gainful use of his entrepreneurial spirit within the drab walls of Shawshank by dealing in contraband and commodities rare to the confines of prison. Andy's demeanor and undeniable sense of hope causes Red to take a deeper look at himself, and the world around him. Andy proves to Red and the other inmates that in the conventional walls of Shawshank prison convention will find no home in his lifestyle.By creating the film's firm foundation, the meticulously chiseled screenplay paved the way for this film's success. Frank Darabont outdoes himself with the phenomenal adaptation of Stephen King's equally noteworthy novella, Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption. In this novella, King demonstrates that he can break free from the genre he dominates and still create a marvelous piece of modern literature. Though the film mirrors the novella in many ways, Darabont illustrates a focused objective of improving upon the areas where the novella came up short, resulting in one of the best book to film transitions ever.While maintaining some of the poetic and moving dialogue of the novella, Darabont also proves that a film's score can generate a great deal of emotional response from its audience, as dialogue does. He employs the cunning Thomas Newman, son of the legendary Hollywood composer, Alfred Newman. Darabont shows recognition for the film's needs by employing Newman, who makes the gentle piano chords whisper softly to the viewer, as if a part of the scripted dialogue. Newman lends himself to individualism and tends to drive more towards the unique in the realm of score composition. His effort in Shawshank did not go unnoticed, as his score received an Oscar nomination in 1995. While unique and independent, Newman's score never once intrudes on your concentration or distracts from the film.With work from vast array of talented scene designers, costume designers, composers, cinematographers, and various other Hollywood artists, the cast of The Shawshank Redemption had a strong foundation to work with. The marvelous cast of this film will dazzle you with some of the most convincing performances you will witness in a film. While both Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman shine as Andy and Red, respectively, the true spectacle of acting lies within the plethora of amazing supporting actors who easily disappear into their roles. Most noticeable of these, the veteran film star James Whitmore, who portrays the elderly Brooks Hatlen. Brooks, a man incarcerated for an unmentioned crime for so long that he finds himself attached to the Shawshank and the daily life he has lead. Each of these actors show a true dedication to their art, and a focused purpose in their motivations, creating a convincing setting that never once caters to anything unbelievable. http://howtogetridofacnequick.org",,Anonymous,Drama

Simply the best film ever made.,"Well as the other more than 2000 review say it, in my opinion this is the best movie created so far. It basically just how life is: you get punched in a face time to time, but you have to stand up, keep your hope and give value to your fellows, because in return life takes care about your reward. Oh yes, and if you face any evil that you can stop, do it. This is the message of the film, if we follow it, life may be as rewarding ultimately for us as for the hero.

Great film,"one of the films that you must watch in lifetime. A film about long-term imprisonment that takes its time to convey what the slow crawl of a lifer's existence might feel like. Thoroughly gripping, and pretty refreshing. Ten years ago The Shawshank Redemption was a low-key prison film that didn't recoup its costs. Slowly it has become one of the most popular movies of all time - and, for some, it has even been life- changing. It is a strange comment to make about a film set inside a prison, but ""The Shawshank Redemption"" creates a warm hold on our feelings because it makes us a member of a family. Many movies offer us vicarious experiences and quick, superficial emotions. ""Shawshank"" slows down and looks. It uses the narrator's calm, observant voice to include us in the story of men who have formed a community behind bars. It is deeper than most films; about continuity in a lifetime, based on friendship and hope.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama

The cast is first rate with everyone giving a great performance. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman carry the movie, but Bob Gunton and Clancy Brown are perfect as the Warden Norton and prison guard captain Hadley respectively. And James Whitmore's portrayal of an elderly inmate Brooks is moving. The screenplay gives almost every actor at least one or more memorable lines through out the film.

My review about Shawshank Redemption,"When I watched Shawshank Redemption at first,I had been in the high school and this film left a good impression with me, I say that I learned how to follow your passions and hopes, how to struggle to be free.

Very Touching,"I can't help but feel emotional every time I see this film. Both Robbins and Freeman are excellent, and the supporting cast is good enough not to screw anything up, but they aren't spectacular.One of the few complaints I have about the film is that it does get slow at times, and I find myself becoming a little bored. Another complaint I have is I wish the makers of Shawshank would give credit where credit is due for the amazing amount of scenes and ideas taken from Escape From Alcatraz, starring Clint Eastwood. How can so many critics claim that Instinct is derivative while none of them mention the fact that Shawshank Redemption is one of the most derivative movies of all time? Shawshank is significantly better than Alcatraz, and it does have important emotional elements that Alcatraz is void of; but a theft is a theft, and that won't change unless the makers of Shawshank start giving credit to Alcatraz. Here are some of the things stolen:The digging tool being kept in a carved out bible and the somewhat funny irony that that entails.The rapist encountering the star in the showers near the beginning of the film to set up further encounters.An inmate at mealtime asking the star whether he will be eating something and then pulling out a small animal. I'm sure most Shawshank lovers thought that the whole bird thing was a completely original symbolic idea. Sorry, but even though the symbolism is well taken, it was FAR from original. The whole idea probably started with the mealtime animal scene, as it was obviously a direct steal.The digging debris being emptied out of the star's pants during strolls.The star befriending the black guy who can get you anything. True, Red is a much more important character in Shawshank, but considering how much was stolen, this certainly was too.There are several others that I have forgotten, as I have not seen Escape from Alcatraz in quite awhile. And if Instinct had any cliché's, Shawshank certainly did, with the evil warden, the evil guard, the religion, the ""highly intelligent"" star, and the concentration on the ""hole"", where the star is always sent to burn for a while.Despite all of this, I really do like Shawshank Redemption and will probably watch it many times in the future, but it absolutely amazes me that I have not seen or heard one single critic mention the robbery here. And as people became critic-following sheep with Instinct, they certainly did with Shawshank.Jeremy Barger http://clubs.yahoo.com/clubs/firegodsmovieclub",6.0,Anonymous,Drama
