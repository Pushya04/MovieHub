Like a hit to the head from left field,"This movie totally surprised me on every level. I had never even heard of it until recently; when an observant video store clerk noticed how many thrillers I was hiring and suggested it.Having missed it at the movies, I figured it would be the usual B-grade mystery murder flick, a bit of fun at best. Instead this movie had me hooked from the opening sequence; I almost thought they'd put the wrong DVD in the box!The story is like one big twisted, turning tunnel- with barely a glimmer of a light at the end. The cast is great, the setting appropriately scary- with no short measure of red herrings to keep you guessing.The cast really delivers too; the characters are diverse and given enough attention to keep you engaged but not so much as to slow the action down. John Cusack is in fine form as the easily likable ex-cop trying to hold it all together; Jake Busey plays the psychotic to perfection as usual.I don't usually go in for gore, but there's really barely more than a few hints of blood & guts. Definitely one to watch in the dark with a group of friends to scare the hell out of yourselves. You won't regret this one.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"It's a good film full of suspense , thrills , intrigue and lots of killings","The movie centers a motley group who are looking for shelter in a deserted motel , being caught up in a severe rainstorm and stuck at the strange place , located in the desolate Nevada. They are strangers from all different walks of life : a limousine driver escorting a tarnished television star, parents with a young son whose marriage is broken , a policeman transporting a dangerous convict, a gorgeous call girl, a pair of young newlyweds, and a nervous motel manager are shut themselves up during a rainy night . But , the hosts have been murdered one by one . Who's the killer ?.The film is a fascinating whodunit, we have got really intrigued from start to finish . The storyline has a twisted plot and the final has an extraordinary surprise.The flick is inspired by Agatha Christie's classic novel : ¨Ten little indians¨ that has several cinematic adaptations.In the movie there is suspense , thriller, noisy action , emotion and a little bit gore when the assassinations happen.All the cast is nice, but interpretations from Rebecca Mornay and Pruitt Taylor Vince are specially riveting . Alan Silvestri musical score and Papamichael cinematography are atmospheric and adequate. It was shot on a huge sound stage at Sony studios in Culver City . Decent direction by the notable filmmaker James Mangold (Logan, Walk the line , Kate and Leopold, Heavy).Rating 7/10 , above average",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Edge of the seat thriller,"I've never before seen a film that made me sit on the edge of my seat practically from the opening credits. And I never got to sit back.This was a psychological thriller of the best type. There is plenty of opportunity for you to nominate the ""bad guy"" and while you may be right in a sense you will probably also be wrong. The ending is a real shocker - and I suspect that the typical reaction of many viewers is to say ""No way"" - but if you think about it, it is the only possible ending. But you have to think about it - and the film is so action-filled that you never have time. SO the realization must come after the closing credits roll.I'd never seen John Cusack in anything but a comedy before (except for a film called ""Max"", but I saw that before I knew who Cusack was). He pulled off drama equally as well as he does comedy. An impressive talent.And an impressive film.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Not half as good as the reviews say,"I want to start off by saying the postives.the first half of the film is really interesting and goodthe characters and cast is amazingthe realization of the characters true selves is ironicly goodvery interesting and dramatic scenes at least in the first halfthe whole plot idea is uniqueNow for the negatives which ultimately makes this film not half as good as people say.the 2nd half of the film is really badthe ending is given away half way through and you know that everything your watching is fake leaving little imagination or suspense towards the endthere is no twist and the plot seems to end way too quickly. Then there's 30 mins of the film where your just waiting for it to end because you already have expierenced the plot twist and its now anti climactic.the murders are hard to follow and are not very exciting at allthere's way too many ""convenient"" scenes that is caused by crappy writing. Oh the blonde girl opens the door and can only see the shadow of the murderer so nobody still knows who the killer is, pathetic.too many random things happen that were not foreshadowed at all and is just more lazy writing. Why did the car blow up randomly without any foreshadowing whatsoever?the ending isn't a twist and is really anti climactic and cheesy. All suspense is lost and with the typical last scene just leaves no satisfaction for the viewer at all.Summary:
The first half was really interesting and really promising. All to be let down by a really crappy ending and 2nd half. There's too much lazy writing, typical and cheesy scenes that make this a lowsy 6/10 for me. Not the type of movie that deserves this much praise.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"I wanted so much more, this can't be it.","Very few times have I been more excited to see a film than I was to see Identity.  With the healthy revival of the horror genre in the last few years, film makers have been doing it right more times than I can remember since the early 80's.  I think The Ring has set the bar so high for so many films that now writers are trying to do the next great thing to scare the hell out of you.  And every film has a shocking twist to it now a days as well.  Think back to films like The Sixth Sense, The Usual Suspects, Fight Club and a few others and it seems that everyone is now trying to give us the next great twisted film.  Whatever works I guess.  The only danger of that mentality is that when you market a film like the way Identity was marketed, you better make sure that your twist pays off and doesn't make the audience feel cheated.  I read Roger Ebert's review of The Usual Suspects and one of the reasons why he didn't like the film all too well is because he felt that the twist was so truculent, so brash and so unexpected that he felt cheated.  There was no way that he could figure it out and he felt that the creators of the film didn't play fair with it's audience.  While I do not agree with that assessment of The Usual Suspects, I do understand what he was complaining about because that is how I felt here.  The twist is so unexpected, so convoluted and so unfair that when it did happen, I looked at my wife and said, ""What the hell...are you serious?""  And from that point on ( and there was still about 15 minutes left in the film), I just couldn't enjoy what I was watching.  I just couldn't buy into what they were asking me to accept.  Without giving away the film, a good comparison perhaps is to say that if you were told that your two best friends were in a fist fight and you had to stop them from hurting each other, but then found out that it was all spurious expose, would you really fear for their safety or would you watch with a crooked grin on your face?Identity is a film that is blessed with a plethora of excellent horror film elements.  You have ten strangers that all seem to have some sort of connection.  It is a dark and stormy night and the small area in Nevada that they are in is going through a torrential storm.  It is flooding the roads so that everyone has to take refuge at a dingy looking Batesesque looking motel.  The film starts out beautifully with a terrible car accident that may have been triggered by one of the other patrons when she lost some of her luggage on the road which caused the flat tire and this caused the accident.  Everyone seems to be meeting by suspiciously conspicuous circumstances.  What they all have in common and why they are all here is the million dollar question.Soon everyone is settled into the rooms but other eerie events just keep popping up all over the place.  And then finally someone dies.  And in a most heinous of ways.  She has her head cut off and placed in a dryer. Pretty gruesome stuff.  But what is the significance of everyone being here and why can't they get out?  It is almost like they have been brought here by some mystical force and it is keeping them here.  Radios don't work, cars won't start, the storm is flooding everything except the motel and to make matters worse, there is a psychotic prisoner chained to the bathroom wall in one of the rooms.  Add to the story that they all share the same birthday, some strange names and the you now have one seriously confusing film.  And that is where the films stops being suspenceful and confusing and it heads into the absurd.There are enough red herrings introduced in the film as well to throw you off of the real deal but some of those red herrings would have made a more compelling story than they one that the writer's want us to believe.  But what does keep the film flowing is the actors.  With a film blessed with a cast that includes Amanda Peet, Ray Liotta and John Cusack, there is never a dull moment.  Cusack carries the film and every second he is on screen he makes you listen.  He has come such a long way from his days in films like Sixteen Candles and The Sure Thing.  I have never seen him better than he is here.But ultimately what transpires in the last half hour of the film is what put me off.  That is not to say that it will put a typical viewer off the film off, it probably won't.  I have talked to many people that saw the film and loved it.  They liked the twist, they liked the outcome and they liked how it all played out.  I can't really tell you why I didn't care for it, but I just didn't.  And this is coming from a guy that loved the twist in Fight Club, Sixth Sense and The Usual Suspects.  Go figure.  Maybe I didn't feel cheated in those films the way I felt cheated here.6.5 out of 10Maybe the best thing to do is just judge for yourself.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Not Really Scary, Just Good","A+Every so often I like to go into films knowing very little about them. It's gratifying not hearing any news stories, or Internet rumors, or early reviews before you see a film because you can genuinely feel surprised by every passing minute of it. In the case of Identity, I only saw a trailer for it once in theatres and I saw various TV spots before its release, but other than that I knew nothing about the core of the story. I went in with no preconceived notions or opinions. For a change I was being a submissive film viewer.After the credits rolled (by the way I rarely stay until the end of the credits) I was so amazed and surprised by the film that I had just experienced. Identity is a highly original, beautifully constructed, and a mildly scary film that will (excuse my language) do a serious mind f*** on your brain.The less you know about Identity's plot, the better. This is the kind of film you need to go into knowing very little about. There are a few twists, plenty of scares, and also a very surprising ending that will have some people disappointed, or praising its creativity. I'm definitely in the latter on this one.Identity is also a masterpiece of atmosphere. Something that I think is the most important aspect of any movie in this genre. Whether it's Halloween, setting the scene for small town horror, or The Ring, drenching us in very dark and Gothic scenery, atmosphere is what makes or breaks a horror film. Thankfully Identity succeeds by creating an atmosphere that is truly frightening and visually impressive. The motel is a perfect setting for the proceedings that take place throughout the night.A nice ensemble cast rounds out Identity's many incredible attributes. John Cusack gives a very good performance as Ed. Cusack has always been good at playing the 'everyday normal guy' and he uses this to great effect here. It's a layered performance that offers some surprises throughout the picture.The other high profile performer is the always-reliable Ray Liotta as Rhodes. Liotta never seems to disappoint whenever he's performing, even in sub-par material. He's just as good as he usually is in this picture and he uses his sometimes-abrasive personality to its utmost potential.Amanda Peet gives her best performance to date as Paris. She has some nice moments where she's allowed sprinkle some comic relief throughout an otherwise dreary picture. However, when she's required to exhibit real fear, she is more than capable. She also shares some good scenes with Cusack during a few key moments in the film.Clea Duvall and William Lee Scott supply some youth and tenacity as Ginny and Lou. Duvall probably has the role typically called the 'scream queen role' in most horror films and she does well with what she's given. There were times that I could genuinely feel her fear. Scott is given less to do as Lou but he does have some good scenes with Duvall that requires a decent amount of emotion.John Hawkes and John C. McGinley are also adequate in supporting roles. Hawkes is given a fair share of the comedic lines and for the most part he plays the part well. McGinley fairs better as the husband who must tend for his injured wife and social inadequate stepson. If I felt sympathy for anyone the most, it was his character.Rebecca Demornay is given very little to do as the failed movie actress but there are some funny jokes made at her expense as one character asks her 'didn't you used to be that actress?' This is some clever commentary on Demornay's obviously fledgling career. The same can be said for Jake Busey as the convict, who is given little to do and seems out of place when paired with the more talented actors in the picture.What's important is the work these actors do when they're all together. This is very much an ensemble and they play off each other's fear. Their reactions to these situations make the picture all the more frightening.On the other end of the story, Alfred Molina brings a bit of substance to his role, despite have limited screen time as the psychiatrist and Pruitt Taylor Vance will shock, amaze, and terrify you as the murderer waiting for his execution. Vance's portrayal is very frightening, and an ultimately brilliant performance. Given the limited screen time he does a lot with the role.Identity is filled with secrets, surprises, and scares that will have moviegoers talking for quite some time. Much like The Ring it has the potential to have some word of mouth appeal. However, don't listen too much to what people have to say about it because it's best to experience this modern masterpiece of fear, knowing very little about it. I guarantee you will be surprised.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"Unpredictable,exciting,full of mystery and horror psychological thriller","For a start,i would like to say that this film is worth seeing.It is one of the best psychological thrillers that exist so i highly recommend to those who like this kind of movies.The plot was very nice,the twist also and the cast outstanding.Cusack,Liotta,Peet and Hawkes did their best and the result was excellent.I liked a lot the flashbacks that were made -mostly in the beginning. Furthermore,the idea of the whole film was terrific.On the other hand,speaking frankly there was an excessive gore and emphasis on the murders that didn't impress me;a big part of the movie was ""dedicated"" to murders.Another thing that i didn't like was the continuous rain that made me feel tired,seeing again again the storm. Moreover,what i liked most-contrary to many people- was the end of the movie.It was unpredictable and,besides that,it is one of the few thrillers that you cannot find out the end easily.It was very interesting and made me sit tight on my couch .If you don't pay attention for a while you will ""get lost"". I should not forget to refer to the hot presence of Peer that embellished the movie apart from her casting abilities. Lastly,you should make sure that you will be 100% concentrated on the film in order to understand what is happening cause i regard it as one of the most difficult movies to understand.It is certain that this film will dominate you with mystery and in parallel make you think a lot of things that will be predicted wrong in the end. I would give 9 -at least- out of 10 to Identity.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A Thrilling Puzzle with Cusack at the Helm,"""Identity"" is a film that weaves an intricate web of suspense, masterfully led by John Cusack's compelling performance. As viewers, we are taken on a psychological roller coaster, filled with the twists and turns that define a great thriller. Cusack, known for his ability to embody complex characters, leaves us in a state of perpetual wonder-questioning each clue and doubting every revelation.Plot: The movie unfolds like a dark and stormy night, perfect for those Saturday afternoons when you crave a mystery that keeps you guessing. It cleverly plays with the concept of identity itself, pushing the audience to consider what truly defines us.Pacing: While the narrative is generally engaging, there are moments where the tension wanes and the pace slows down-a minor hiccup in an otherwise tightly wound plot.Overall Experience: Despite these brief lulls, ""Identity"" stands out as an exemplary thriller. It doesn't just entertain; it ensnares you in its puzzle, demanding your attention until its final, satisfying piece is placed.Whether you're a fan of Cusack or simply love a good mind-bender, ""Identity"" promises to deliver. Just be prepared for the slow burn-it only makes the eventual payoff all the more thrilling.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

That's getting way harder now, but that's ok.It's dark, it's raining all the time, it's so corny in places you think who wrote this, a child?

Psycho meets The Sixth Sense:  I Don't See Dead People,"""Identity"" has some solid performances by several fine actors, not the least of which are John Cusack and Ray Liotta.  The story and the plot have terrific potential.  It could have been a great movie, despite being a somewhat shameless rip-off of a short film made a couple of years ago that manages to tell the exact same story in about 20 minutes (sorry, I don't recall the name of the low-budget, black and white short that appeared as filler between features on the Sundance Channel).Unfortunately, this movie blows it BIG TIME at the end.  I don't want to give it all away, but this is one of those movies that would have been an excellent psychological thriller if the writer and/or director hadn't decided that it needed a big surprise ending.  They achieve this ending by suddenly splicing in a bunch of extra scenes at the very end that turn all of the build-up in the rest of the movie into nothing more than a bunch of red herrings.  The ending chosen opens up a bunch of huge holes in the story that can only be explained away by a variant of the old ""it was all just a dream"" cop-out ending.  Personally, I hate it when a film makes such a transition in a glaring, rough way that almost takes the viewer by the back of the neck, shakes him violently and screams in his face, ""No, look stupid, we fooled you!  Now look at all the things we didn't let you see during the rest of the film!  Thanks for your $8.00, schmuck.""  I suppose the film makers HAD to do this, though, since the movie's twist is otherwise given away halfway through the film, at which point the balance of the movie is utterly predictable to anyone who hasn't been watching it with a burlap sap tied over their head.  Clearly, desperate moves were called for in order to achieve a blockbuster ending. Did I say blockbuster?  Change that to ""lackluster.""This film could have raised a very interesting and original question about the nature of personality (and identity -- get it?), but instead, it lets itself be turned into ""Psycho"" meets ""The Sixth Sense.""  Instead of ""I see dead people,"" it turns into ""I don't see dead people.""Big deal.  It could've been a good one.  Now it's poop.If it weren't for the strong performances by Cusack and Liotta, I would've given this one a 5/10.  I'll give it an extra point for those guys, though.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Holds on in 2024,"Identity is a ""whodunit"" with a twist tight enough to make your head spin. Its somewhat simplistic plotline turns 180 degrees in a satisfying way, showing that there is more to this killing spree than meets the eyes. It didn't get that many recognitions, though, and that might be because of the sort of beat-down cast.The story follows 10 strangers stranded on a motel because of a huge storm. Though they seem unconnected, they must get strength in numbers when, one by one, someone is murdering them. It's the classic ""who the hell is doing this"" that keeps you going, and fans of mystery will find rejoice by that fact alone.But there is a bit more to this movie.The story also introduces a series of scenes between a Judge, Prosecution, and Defense, the latter in a final appeal to avoid death sentence to a murderer who, seemingly, is the one that is killing the strangers in the hotel. It is not clear rather we are in the past or in the future, and that is a nice touch to this flick by James Mangold, written by Michael Cooney.The writer didn't release that many gems, Identity probably being his magnus work.Now James Mangold is well known for some bangers (always questionable, of course): Ford v. Ferrari, Logan, but by the time he directed Identity, he had on his repertoire Girl, Interrupted, and Cop Land, I guess shy from mainstream, but solid flicks. He is no stranger to making solid movies, and Identity shows his guidance pretty well.The cast is strong, which I think justifies the budged invested in this movie, considering that the setting is an average motel, and there is little to none CGI, so the money was to pay the actors and the crew, the latter, of course, underpaid one would think. Identity grossed 3 times its budget, a fair prize for the entry.Back to the casting, we have John Cusack, lead actor portraying Ed, a limo driver stuck in this mess after getting involved in a car accident.Ray Lyotta, a deteriorating actor as Rhodes, a cop transporting a murderer.Jake Busey, the murderer that Rhodes is transporting.Amanda Peet, trying-hard-as-she-can actress as Paris, a prostitute that wants a career change for good.John Hawkes, a consolidated actor as Larry, the motel owner that just wants to score big.John McGinley, another consolidated actor as Dr. York, a husband and father with some loose screws on his head.Alfred Molina, Dr. Otto Octavius but now as Dr. Malick, the doctor trying to prove that the one murderer is actually fit for a mental institution rather than the needle.You get the point that the casting is strong to some extent, a group of consolidated and powerful actors, each one portraying a character that is trying to take lead somehow.The story itself is pretty nice, eerie from the start, which should give you a good hint to the plot twist at the end that makes you go ""wow! Good one."" You might feel a bit cheated, but it's like when your partner lies to you to, all of the sudden, tells you that you are to get a new baby or a puppy - wonderful but it comes with the bother of responsibility. Identity pushes the twist element to the limit with the audience, but I think it worked out in the end, delivering a satisfying experience, and, after understanding the twist, an expected and well-thought ending.If you like mystery thrillers, this one is for you. The final twist is potentially a mix-bag to some people, but a solid 7.3 on IMDb, 75% popcornmeter on Rotten, in 2024, shows that the movie holds itself on.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

The quick background stories of each characters being in the specific situation and place was very effective as it allows us to really try to take interest in the plot and try to understand the incidents.The introduction of each characters were also very effective. The way the meet, the way they act on different circumstances, everything was on point.

Very good,"On a dark and stormy night 11 strangers have to take refuge in an isolated motel when a rainstorm turns into a monsoon.  One by one they begin to be killed...but by who and for what reason?The set-up is neat (if predictable) and there's a great opening showing how the actions of one of them (Amanda Peet) inadvertantly causes some serious damage for the others.  There also is some great acting by Peet, John C. McGinley and Ray Liotta (who REALLY chews the scenery).  There are also some moments that will make you jump and there are two neat twists at the end.The only bad things about this movie is some clumsy exposition (John Cusack tells his whole life story while photographing a corpse), some truly bad lines and a surprisingly lousy performance by Cusack.  What's happened to him?  He looks worn-out and haggard in this film.However, these are minor problems and the film is well worth seeing and keeps you guessing about what's going on till the last moment.

Crediting the Actors,"""Identity"" has a preposterous plot device, and a chaotic pace... bombarding the viewer with screams, mangled images, knockout scenes, & invincibly ignorant actions. And yet even with its manipulation of characters on auto-pilot, some emerge as at least somewhat memorable. And it's they who carry ""Identity"" forward. I'm speaking of the parts played by John Cusack, Amanda Peet, Ray Liotta, John Hawkes, John McGinley, and Alfred Molina.Perhaps the most egregious demand that each must overcome is the typical thriller's insistence that smart characters act as dumb as possible for the sake of a formulaic narrative. This means repeated disillusionment especially with the initially convincing characters who promise sanity, grounding, and narrative coherence. Here Cusack and Liotta seem appointed to this authority. And fulfill it well until they quickly fall in with the motel's motley tenants who are thrashing around in a whirl of fragmented scenes. If Liotta is called upon to make the steepest collapse, it's Cusack who must undergo the most gyrations in character. But subsumed and contorted they still manage to hold onto more than just the outlines of their characters--at least Cusack certainly does, while Liotta, unfortunately, gets knocked to kingdom come by the boisterous intrusiveness of this bleak rainy night.Mcginley's and Molina's characters hold onto their original and charged portrayals because the plot leaves them relatively unscathed. They need simply convince in their appointed roles which is what they do. As for John Hawkes, the motel manager--and one more plot objectified actor, he has just enough convincing moments in peek scenes to squeeze him into the ""memorable"" category.But it's Amanda Peet who can not only stand up to anything the plot assaults her with, but she drives home the fact that if you forget everything else about ""Identity,"" you won't forget her. No kowtowing here to anyone inside or outside the movie. I guess I'd call her brave-spirited, outspoken, super engaged, and physically dominant. And her array of taut facial expressions keep drawing you in, one after another, right up until the end--which she should own and, in my book, does own.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Confusing but mostly satisfying,"At the start of the movie, Dr. Malick is evaluating Malcolm Rivers, who is about to be executed for a series of murders, unless Malick can convince those who need to hear that Rivers was insane.Then a seemingly unrelated series of events take place. And while we don't see Malick or Rivers again for a while, they are somehow connected with these events too. Exactly how I've never quite figured out.The one common thread is that all the parties involved (except Malick) are driving through rural Nevada in heavy rain that is causing so much flooding everyone will end up at this one motel. A hooker who wants to grow oranges in Florida, the spoiled actress Carolina Suzanne and her driver Ed, the York family, newlyweds Ginny and Lou, and Rhodes, who is transporting prisoner Robert Maine.Motel clerk Larry calmly checks everyone in, not exactly upset by all the chaos. But there's no working phone, and one of the potential guests seriously needs emergency help. Ed tries, but there's too much flooding to make it to a hospital and even cell phones don't work.Ed, a former cop, tries to take charge of the situation, though Rhodes seems to think he should be in charge. And then people start dying. And the prisoner escapes. The newlyweds are in Room 6, and the number falls, making it look like a 9. The main clues to the murders are keys found with the bodies, and the keys seem to be showing up in sequence--10, 9, 8, 7 ...So who will survive? Who is really behind the murders? And how are Malick and Rivers connected to all this?I found the early scenes fascinating. Everyone was connected to everyone else, and if one event hadn't happened, none of the others would have. Eventually, I was just plain confused because I didn't know what was going on.And when the murderer was finally revealed, he or she was not really revealed. I felt like I had heard three different possibilities but not been told which one was the right one. Then again, maybe I was told more information than was needed, and some of it was irrelevant. But I can't believe they would go THIS far ...There were a lot of good acting performances. I genuinely dislike John McGinley, but he played a totally different character here than what I am used to. He seemed compulsive and somewhat mentally ill but genuinely desired to do the right thing.Gary Busey was scary and almost funny, not too different from some of his other bad guy characters.Bret Loehr didn't have much to do early as the little boy who had lost one parent and seemed likely to lose two more. But he was quite good later.John Cusack carried the movie. He showed frustration but also competence. His character wasn't perfect but he wanted to do the best he could and didn't have patience with those who didn't care about others or couldn't handle the situation.And Rebecca DeMornay did the demanding celebrity routine quite well.I'm not going to recommend this for family viewing because some of the bodies are hard to look at.It's mostly a worthy effort.",,Anonymous,Mystery
Too far fetched to make it a good film.,"As so often happens a film starts really well, it gets the movie goer hooked and then? It dissapears up its own back side in the attempt to be to clever or to try and put in a breath taking twist that fails in this case , big time. This film had lots of promise and a good cast , lets face it we could watch anything with Ray Liotta in it couldnt  we? But instead of this being an above average slasher/stalker type film it decided to go all deep and paranormal and in the end lost all credability. As for the twist , well , without giving anyhing away it will make you laugh out loud its so pathetic. Anyway , you might like it but it was way to clever for it's own good in my opinion. 6 out of 10.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Entertaining, but not flawless","Cliché and predictable mystery/thriller about ten strangers stranded at a desolated motel in Nevada during a nasty rainstorm. Meanwhile, a psychiatrist (Molina) is trying to save a convict (Vince) from the death penalty by proving him insane, supported by new evidence of a recovered journal. The intersection of the two plots can only lead to one conclusion, unless you fail to realize that there's a reason these two stories are within the same film. Despite all the failed surprises and twists, the plot at least delivers the payoff the story has built up; and you'll find satisfaction in the film if you can shrug off the countless flaws with the realization that it never really hinders the progression. Cusack and Liotta are as good as always; Peet delivers an impress performance; and Hawkes is underrated as usual. If anything, it will entertain.*** (out of four)",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"If it weren't for the confusing final solution, this would've been a perfect thriller","A truly excellent film in my opinion, riddled high with tension and unnerving edge. It also makes the audience ask many questions, and on the most part, the film excels in answering those questions. Director James Mangold ensured there were plenty of tense moments and wholly convincing shocks. I can't count the number of times I was out of my seat or biting my nails, and the murders were very brutal, well most of them were. The camera-work was fantastic and quite possibly the film's main merit, the story(on a parallel with And Then There Were None, but with definite plot differences) and the performances from the likes of John Cusack, Ray Liotta, Rebecca DeMornay, Jake Busey and Amanda Peet were nothing short of superb. And the film's length and pace were just right. My only problem with Identity, which was nearing to perfection, was the final solution, I did find it confusing and a tad implausible. But overall, it is a taut and solid thriller, that ticks almost all the right boxes. 9/10 Bethany Cox",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery

well made murder mystery and then ...,"Psychiatrist Malick (Alfred Molina) is treating mass murderer Malcolm Rivers. It's the night before his execution and he's being transported to a hearing to determine his sanity. Meanwhile another part of the movie centers on an isolated motel. It's a torrential rainstorm in the middle of the night. George York (John C. McGinley) brings in his injured wife Alice (Leila Kenzle) and finds motel manager Larry (John Hawkes). Ed (John Cusack) the chauffeur distracted by spoiled actress Caroline Suzanne (Rebecca De Mornay) had run her over after the Yorks broke down by the side of the road. Con woman Paris (Amanda Peet) hit a telephone pole and knocks out the land line. The motel is cut off by flooding. Lou (William Lee Scott) and Ginny (Clea DuVall) are newlyweds as well as corrections officer Rhodes (Ray Liotta) who is transporting a prisoner (Jake Busey) are also stranded at the motel. The prisoner escapes and people starts dying.The movie starts out as two related stories of a escaped killer. That is something a little bit off about the scenario but it's never quite obvious. For example, the movie doesn't need to go back to Dr. Malick if this is a simple slasher flick. The characters are all a bit specific. The total isolation seems too convenient. The movie seems to be a good B-movie with a lot of solid actors for the first two acts. Then it becomes something even more.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
The plot is based on a combination of several past thrillers...,"IDENTITY is really a case of stolen identity. It borrows heavily from a number of other thrillers by using elements of them and stirring them up into a new blend of chills.Many are cliché ridden elements: a savage thunderstorm at a deserted highway motel in the middle of nowhere, a number of people who realize that they are being killed off one by one, a couple of authority figures who only appear to be what they are, and several other twists such as having the chief suspect being completely innocent. There are shades of Agatha Christie, ""Psycho"" and several other stories that must have been the inspiration for the plot.But sadly, the film is badly marred by some senseless revelations and a completely baffling twist ending that is surprising but unbelievable.Good for any mystery fan who likes a story that makes you think, and well acted by RAY LIOTTA, JOHN CUSACK, ALFRED MOLINA and others, but misses being taken as a serious thriller by quite a wide margin.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Excellent taut who done it with a twist,"This is an excellent film from a solid director at the top of his game.

Ray Liotta again is absolutely a standout performer as he was in Goodfellas for which he was rightly lauded for and John Cusack's brilliant turn makes us wish he had put in a similar performance in his more recent outings since.I won't ruin it for you, but if you like thrillers, or just compelling stories in the Thriller genre, just watch it.

An Imaginative Mystery Film,"This is an imaginative mystery film. Set during a storm, 10 different characters take refuge in a motel in the middle of nowhere. One by one they become victims of a psychotic killer whose identity is not disclosed until the very end. Because it keeps the audience guessing it manages to keep up the suspense and utilizes the dark, stormy environment to achieve an exciting climax. Good performances are accomplished by John Cusack (""Ed""), Ray Liotta (""Rhodes"") and Amanda Peet (""Paris""). But I think the best acting was done by John Hawkes as the motel desk clerk, ""Larry"". And while it has no major faults, I would have preferred to see more of Rebecca De Mornay who played the self-centered actress named ""Caroline Suzanne"".

"Great sequences, but predictable","When 10 strangers come together in a series of events in a rainy night at a hotel, they soon find they're being killed one by one, and one of them might be the killer. If they are to survive this ordeal, which doesn't seem likely, they will have to find out a secret that brought them together.Characters are interesting, and have great depth and appeal to them. John Cusack is good in everything he does. He still has that baby face, but as our main character, Ed, does the job at convincing us he is more then what we thought he was. Ray Liotta plays a cop, Rhodes, that seems to be the opposite of Ed. Where as Ed is cool and seems to have control, Rhodes is a loaded shotgun, angry and disorganized.Identity manages to grab you rather well in the beginning. It does a good try at attempting the Twilight Zone effect, and perhaps would have made a great 1 hour episode. But in the VERY beginning, there is a scene which almost ruined the movie for me. I won't tell you what it is, but if you pay close enough attention to it, and a few other elements, you'll figure out most of the movie long before it's over. I did. I caught every little thing the movie threw out, and although the pieces didn't make complete sense, by the time it got to the 'twist', I was underwhelmed.Identity has 2 twists. The last and final twist isn't as surprising as the first (and the first one was easy to figure out, remember? Of course you do, because you were paying attention.) Were it not for the predictability, this would have been a better flick. Perhaps you can enjoy the movie a little better if you don't analyze everything like I did.Still, if you like suspense movies, rent it.

A clichéd but fun classic whodunit,"James Mangold's 'Identity' is a film so wrapped up in tricking you it bypasses its story in the process. The picture tells two stories breaking between throughout. The primary tale is one of murderous chance. During a torrential rainstorm several people find themselves caught at a motel unable to go in either direction on the highway because of floods. All of a sudden people begin dying gruesome deaths.The secondary plot has a convicted killer's lawyer meeting with a judge and prosecutors to determine a new fate for his clearly mentally ill client. This story is smaller and less engaging as the one set at the motel. However, with both stories you feel you are on a ride that will end with a twist. So sure are you that when the twists come, they are surprising but not as thrilling since you spent over an hour knowing it was coming.In the end I decided the good outweighed the bad ... slightly. Most of 'Identity' has an old fashioned whodunit aspect that you can't help but love. The ending is iffy and although the story hooks you, there are so many clichéd plot points that your head shaking and eye-rolling stands in the way of enjoying an all together decent film.I have found myself watching the meat of it several times, addicted by the intrigue even though I know what is to happen. There is fine acting by John Cusack, Amanda Peet, John C. McGinley, and others. The direction is also quite skillful and leaves you right on the edge of your seat when need be. There are many who will love this film for its cleverness. Others will find that it is too cunning for its own good. **.5 out of ****",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"Managed to keep attention, but not suspense, throughout for the unexpected ending","It does a decent job at establishing the setting and the characters. Despite it not being tagged as a horror movie, it certainly takes on a lot of the horror-like cinematography once the action kicks in. Despite the acting being really bland, the characters feels believable as they talk and act realistically - except to obviously progress the plot. The pacing was rather good, with not much downtime from impactful events or dialogue. But it lacked the suspense completely... Potentially because it is too mysterious to even speculate what is behind the corner.The primary aspect that might be taken issue with is definitely the conclusion. It certainly undermined the joy of trying to figure out who the antagonist is, as it is rather unpredictable. But this served the movie much better than giving too many hints and ruin the conclusion. Furthermore, it becomes the most fulfilling moment of the movie - as a conclusion should be - but does so in a unique manner. It definitely could have been executed in a more thoughtful manner, with extended knowledge prior to the conclusion as a potential solution to make it a much more touching ending.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Watchable, but overall a disappointing waste of talent.","Ten or so people become stranded at a vacant hotel on a dark and very rainy night. Emotions are high since a woman has been hit by a car and is seriously injured. The roads are blocked off by flooding. No one can escape. What better time for a psycho killer to start picking them off one by one?That's the basic plot of this TEN LITTLE INDIANS-style suspenser, with all of the expected plot twists and brief gory flashes of violence, and it actually begins surprisingly well. The production values/technical credits are top-notch and the cast is good. John Cusack as a chauffeur escorting obnoxious actress Rebecca De Mornay, Ray Liotta as a cop with insane killer Jake Busey in his custody, Amanda Peet as a reformed hooker with a stash of dough, Clea Duvall and William Lee Scott as a bickering young couple, John C. McGinely as the husband of the wounded woman and (especially) John Hawkes as the sleazy hotel manager round out the cast of suspects. Several interesting things happen along the way in this film before it completely derails in the final third.Despite strong things working in its favor, IDENTITY has several dull stretches and the ending is very poor, a frustrating cop-out to those of us who have seen this same tired ending a million times before. Whatever psychological mishmash the filmmakers want to throw at us is irrelevant; the ending here is no different than the ""it was all a dream"" ploy used to bail out after the script becomes an overplotted mess there's no other way out of.",5.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Agatha Christie would be proud,"Identity is a very good thriller that will leave you on the edge of your seat. Ten strangers with secrets are brought together in a savage rainstorm: A limo driver, an '80s TV star, a cop who is transporting a killer, a call girl, a pair of newlyweds and a family in crisis, all take shelter at a desolate motel run by a nervous night manager. Relief in finding shelter is quickly replaced with fear as the ten travelers begin to die, one by one. They soon realize that, if they are to survive, they'll have to uncover the secret that has brought them all together. The plot is nothing new but the film is still effective. There are some really surprising twits while others you can probably see coming. The film is also very scary especially since the setting is at some creepy motel in the middle of no where. The acting is pretty good with the best being John Cusack. He is kind of underrated though he has proved in the past that he can play any type of role. Amanda Peet is good though she tends to play the same character in every film. Ray Liotta does a good job as well. The rest of the cast include Clea DuVall, Rebecca De Mornay, Alfred Molina and John Hawkes. James Mangold directs and does a good job of keeping the audience guessing right until the end. The film is only 90 minutes long so it won't take up to much of your time. Though because of that, the characters aren't as interesting as they would had been if it was longer. The problem I had with Identity was the ending as it was kind of stupid. Everything before the ending though is entertaining and all the twists are done well even if their not original. But the ending nearly kills the film and if it would if everything before wasn't good. Still Identity is defiantly one of the better thrillers of 2003 and it's a must see.

"Review Of ""Identity""","""Identity"" is a 2003 James Mangold Directed film about 10 strangers who meet at a seedy Nevada motel and soon realize that they are being killed off one by one. Let me start off by saying that I love a good thriller. If you have an intriguing premise and a good touch of tasteful twists here and there, I'll ultimately find the movie to be, to some degree, good. ""Identity"" definitely possessed the former, but tricked me with the latter. From the moment this movie starts you are almost immediately pulled into it's fascinating plot. And as the movie goes on, twists ensue, leading you to reconsider every view of every character in the film. However, the last twist of this film, in short, angered me. I found the final twist of the film to make sense, but it was the most unsatisfying ending I could have imagined this film to present. The film presented an incredibly new type of plot for me and in my opinion fudged up the ending a bit. However, every minute up to the last 5 were pretty thrilling and intense. All of the actors did a good job in their roles and their lines were fairly well written. The direction by Mangold is really quite beautiful - he really creates some unsettling imagery here. Overall, I can say that ""Identity"" was a enjoyable movie. . .up until the end.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery

The very last twist is pretty terrible, though, especially when the director felt he had to show everyone his own cleverness by repeating the key scenes throughout the movie that show that this plot development does have some merit.

"Begins very well, then falls apart","This film looked so promising in the trailers.  And the first hour more than lives up to the promise.  The rainstorm, cheap motel, remote desert locations, and offbeat characters with secrets to hide make for a suspenseful horror-mystery.  The use of the hotel room keys was a clever device. The cast does well.  John Cusack is compelling in his first horror film, and Ray Liotta is well-cast as a seemingly inept policeman.  And the sultry Amanda Peets makes the most of her character. She is not a mindless sex object, helpless damsel-in-distress, or an invulnerable superwoman, but a frightened yet determined woman doing her best to stay alive. In addition, Rebecca DeMornay shows a terrific sence of humor and self-parody as a snooty, washed-up actress who stumbles into the confusion.  But just as the film seems to be nearing an exciting climax, it takes a disastrous wrong turn.  It becomes a dull psychological courtroom drama that undermines everything that has happened.

What was that plot twist?,"Identity (2003) is a whodunnit mystery thriller by James Mangold that starts off in an interesting way and then falls apart on its face by the end of the runtime.Positives for Identity (2003):
First off, the movie's premise is quite solid to where you have this group of people stuck at this motel and get killed off one by one and you're trying to figure out who the killer is. There's also the side plot where a murderer has his fate being held up in the air, but I'll get to that later.

There's some great intense and buildup throughout the runtime that will have you on the edge of your seat whenever they happen. And finally, the plot twist of this movie was a shocker for me and I didn't see it coming, but there are some major issues with that twist.Negatives for Identity (2003):
The big plot twist of this movie was certainly shocking, but it was also incredibly stupid and ridiculous. I mean who thought that this would work, it's so confusing and random that I'm still struggling with how it was given the okay to be apart of this movie.

Insulting rubbish,"It's the early noughts, and people are dropping left and right. This isn't the plot of the film, it's the state of the film industry. Nobody's going to the theatres anymore, except kids who watch comic book and animated films. The reason Hollywood is in such dire straits? Films like 'Identity'.Unlike today's streaming services, Hollywood wasn't placing any bets on intelligent drama or thought-provoking sci-fi, it looked to replicate a fluke hit like 'The Usual Suspects' or 'The Sixth Sense'. 'Identity' is essentially a combination of the two-a thriller that tries hard to be clever, yet you'll successfully solve the mystery in the first ten minutes.Some decent actors try their best to save the film, but the writing is hokey and there's no real character development, just a lot of far-fetched plot points. As is common with these types of wannabe clever films, the plot points are ridiculous and there are holes you could drive a semi through.Even the scares are hokey, often more humorous than frightening. Plus they slathered on the most tired of horror tropes, like constant thunder and lightning.The most offensive aspect to me was borrowing from 'And Then There Were None', which is a far superior story and film. I suggest you rent it instead, if you want to watch something both clever and well written.",4.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Good but a bit cheap and gimmicky,"Identity has a good cast, non-stop use of those rainmaking setups and an entertaining story. I could tell they were going to pull a fast one at some point when the red herrings were being dropped and we were kept guessing who the killer really was. The twist was about as farcical as I expected, however most people don't seem to mind given the IMDb rating (currently 7.2), and reviews I've read of another film with an infamous twist, Fight Club.I don't think this is supposed to be a big film, so for what it is (90 minutes of entertainment) it's not bad. The film's greatest asset is it's cast.",,Anonymous,Mystery
Great movie. Cusack was spectacular.,"This was a truly great movie. Honestly, the only criticisms I had was that it didn't go into the characters very deep, but once you get to the almost end you kinda figure out why. The story was excellent, as was the cast. John Cusack is at his best here. Everything just pulls together and ""fits"" like a good movie should.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Thoughtful and entertaining,"Wow! Finally another movie that makes you think about what you're seeing as opposed to presenting you with endless special effects. Not, perhaps, as thought-provoking as Memento, but enjoyably brain exercising nonetheless.Having gone into this movie, as I prefer to, with no preconceptions, I assumed it was a simple whodunnit. I was pleasantly surprised to find the greater depth and plot twists involved. Actually, even as a whodunnit, forgetting the real plot for a moment, it works pretty well.There are more red-herrings in this movie than the North Sea fishing fleet has, so be warned that whatever you think is going on, probably isn't.All of the characters have decent roles. There are no Star Trek ""red shirt"" security men here, waiting to be killed off. No one whom you think from the start ""he's dead"". The killer could be anyone, no one person stands out head and shoulders above the rest.Every time you think you know what's going on, the rug is pulled out from under you and you have to start over again. The final revelation is elegant and thoughtful and, whilst it trivialises much of what you've just watched a bit, it is nevertheless an original idea and made me glad I went to see this film.Sadly, because of it's nature, this is a one-view film. Although it may be worth watching again to see if you can spot the clues to the truth of the situation. And it's certainly a good film to watch with someone who hasn't seen it, just to watch their reactions.Well worth a watch.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery

The rest of the cast give good value, with an amusing, if slightly over the top turn by Rebecca de Mornay.Mangold's direction is very effective, and together with cinematography Phedon Papamichael, composer Alan Silvestri and production design Michael Freiberg produce a fantastic atmosphere that creates the ideal setting for this story to play out.While hardly a memorable film, it is an entertaining, suspenseful and well made one.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"""Ten Little Indians"" meets ""Psycho""...","Who would ever in their life guess that the writer of ""Identity,"" a fairly clever whodunnit horror-thriller, wrote and directed ""Jack Frost,"" the underwritten, deeply flawed (and just plain stupid) thriller about a killer snowman? Not I. But yet I suppose strange things really do happen, because ""Identity"" is written by Michael Cooney, who isn't nearly as looney in his writing as he was for the other films of his, which includes ""Jack Frost 2: Revenge of the Mutant Killer Snowman"" (2000).""Identity"" starts out strong and ends fairly well - though the ending was a bit strange, to say the least. It is about a group of ten people who get stranded at a run-down motel during a desert rainstorm in Nevada. Unable to leave the motel, the occupants start to die off one-by-one, though they have no idea who is the killer nor why s/he is killing. Sound like ""Ten Little Indians"" to you? Well, it may, but the underlying premise of the film is wholly different.The occupants include a limo driver named Ed (John Cusack), who was driving a down-on-her-luck movie star (Rebecca DeMornay) when he hit a woman in the middle of an interstate. The woman's husband (John C. MicGinley, who doesn't look a day older than he did in ""Platoon"") and son help their mother back to a crummy old motel run by a comical man named Larry (John Hawkes). Ed goes out to find an ambulance, but instead stumbles upon a flooded road and a hooker, Paris (Amanda Peet), who was fleeing to Florida to start her life over fresh again before the rain came.Ed's limo gets stuck in the floodwater and two newlyweds agree to give him and Paris a ride back to the motel. All four return to the motel, defeated by the blocked roads, when a policeman (Ray Liotta) transporting a homicide convict (Jake Busey) shows up, requesting a room. Now there are ten people with completely different backgrounds, stranded in a motel. But they may have more in common than they think.People start dying in an apparently random order. And every time someone is murdered, a room key is left behind with the dead corpse, signifying a countdown until there are only a handful of people still alive.To spoil the end of ""Identity"" would be wrong, but I will say that I had guessed it before I even saw the movie. I guessed the end from the trailer. This kind of ruined some parts of the film for me, and I must say that ""Identity"" would have held my suspense even more so than it did if the trailer hadn't decided to give so much away.I really enjoy whodunnits, especially clever ones. I like when a handful of people with no connection find out they may have more of a connection than they believed at first. ""Clue"" with Tim Curry was a film bashed by critics and audiences, but I loved it. ""Identity"" is in the same vein as this but it isn't as funny nor literal. It is more of a psychological-thriller-whodunnit than a plain ol' whodunnit. Fans of Agatha Christy (who wrote, if you don't already know, such famous novels as ""Murder on the Orient Express"") may be baffled by this film. Many people will be looking for the killer the entire time, guessing who it is, but in the last half hour the plot finally starts to unveil itself.John Cusack gives one of the strongest performances of his career as Ed, an ex-cop who suspects there may be something going on under all this, more than meets the eye. I have a few theories about his character and some of the others, but I would have to give away the end of the movie to delve into these theories, so I will therefore resist, and just leave it with the fact that I really like Ray Liotta, but John Cusack stole the show.The movie is directed by James Mangold, who wrote and directed 1997's ""Cop Land"" with Sylvester Stallone and Robert De Niro. He's a talented director. His inspiration to be a suspenseful director shines through here - with a bit of practice and imagination (which this film clearly has), he could become a great director.I enjoyed ""Identity,"" I really did. It was only 90 minutes long, for one matter, and never became repetitive. Even with knowing the ending, I was still held in suspense by the film, which makes me wonder just how suspenseful it must be to those who have no idea what the ending will be like.My only complaint? The film switches courses a few too many times. It seems as though it doesn't always know what it wants to be. At times it is a thriller, at times it is a horror, at times it is a drama, at times it is a comedy, at times it is a psycho movie, and at times it is surreal. But there is some great talent in this movie. It is cleverly written, even if the ending seems a bit strange and an easy way out. I haven't seen an ending like this on a whodunnit before. It will surprise a lot of people. That may be standard nowadays with films like ""The Sixth Sense"" cruising around, but ""Identity"" seems - for the most part - to stay true to the classic whodunnits, and for that I give it a lot of credit. It is a very entertaining and suspenseful film.4/5 stars -John Ulmer",,Anonymous,Mystery
"Good, but not great","Good, but not great. Started off quite lamely, and seemed like it was just going to be another average slasher-whodunit-thriller. However, the first twist made it into an interesting psychological drama. This twist was not enough to sustain the movie though, and the second twist just seemed gratuitous, for the sake of a climactic ending.Reasonably entertaining and intriguing though, despite all its faults.Performances are so-so. Amanda Peet is about the only actor/actress that shines. John Cusack and Ray Liotta should be the stars but just seem like they're trying too hard. John C McGinley is irritating in his role - he should stick to comedy.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Skip the last chapter, you'll be glad you did","Identity is an above average horror film and I am always rooting for B-movie filmmakers when they break into classier material(the writer of jack frost 1 & 2).

I understand what the writer and director were trying to do with the end but it took a high quality horror film and shot it in the foot.The film presents a interesting idea for a story that I will not give away for people who have not seen it. John Cusak has a really strong performance the kind that is brilliant in a way that never gets noticed. The cast is strong, with quite a few bigger named actors who seemed willing to be wet for weeks.The film is in a genre that the director refers to as single location horror. Panic room and phone booth are better recent films in the same vein. Classics include Rear window and Alien. The confined space provides a lot of the tension. Worth a watch.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Stylish and Star-Studded Who-Dunnit Horror,"SPOOKTOBER chapter 19:
A Horror with a TwistOkay, it may not be classified as a horror movie by majority of the sources, but I've always considered ""Identity"" to be one, for it feels like one. And it's a great, fast-paced, atmospheric and engaging mystery thriller decorated with the many qualities of the horror genre.It's 2003, and the well-known James Mangold (""Walk the Line"", ""Logan"", ""Ford V Ferrari"" etc.) directs a script by the director and writer of... ""Jack Frost""? Thankfully, Michael Cooney can write both goofy and dark horror films. In this one, we have ten strangers, who have travelled down the same remote Nevada desert road, encountered the same storm, the same floods, and have become stranded at the same shady roadside motel. Meanwhile a late night court meeting is taking place as a killer, being transported there at the time, is trying to appeal his brooding death sentence. As the strangers at the Motel become acquainted with each other, somebody is also beginning to kill them one by one. Who is the killer and what exactly is going on?It's a terrific, entertaining who-dunnit taking place on a stormy, dark night, has flashes of violence, and plenty of creepy atmosphere lurking around the motel. The storytelling flows like a river, and it's all neatly packed in a pleasant 90 minute runtime. For a movie with a twist, honestly two of them, it is well structured and holds the good possibility of fooling the viewer.What's even better, it's filled with awesome actors and cool performances - we have John Cusack, Ray Liotta, John Hawkes, Alfred Molina, Jake Busey, Pruitt Taylor Vince and more. Every character has a different shade of personality, and there's always something going on in ""identity"", making it a wholly engaging experience. Appropriately to who's involved, this mystery has a great production design, and an overall visceral aesthetic, from today's standpoint also possessing that palpable early 2000's cinematic horror culture feel.If you haven't seen it, it's worth not looking it up but just going for it - if you like to not be able to predict the outcome of creepy and dark happenings, ""Identity"" got ya.

It borrows from some excellent sources...,"A decent psychological thriller, but it falls a little short of being really good. It borrows from some excellent sources with some bits of Hitchcock, Agatha Christie, and The Twilight Zone. Unfortunately it's got a bit of slasher film which is what keeps me from recommending it higher. If you can handle some genuinely grotesque scenes and jump cuts galore, the rest of the movie is definitely worth checking out. For that reason, I won't say too much more about it to avoid spoiling any parts of the movie. It's well acted, well directed, and a good story.

Has you at the edge of your seat until it ends...,"""Identity"" has a great cast as well as a great director. The cast delivered very good performances, especially John Cusack. Now this is not a horror, but it will still have you closing one eye resisting the urge to turn away. The shots were very good with creating some jaw clenching suspense, they were the type of shots you see in horror movies where you know that something bad is seconds from happening.By the first ten or twenty minutes you get this feeling that the entire movie is going to be nonstop suspense that gives you a feeling as if you were the character but instead of you making the decisions you are being forced into them. This movie holds up the entire time and would have been great but...The ending. The movie got your hopes up because it had a really original good idea and had you pretty scared throughout, and it was executed so poorly it made me legitimately upset and kind of angry. It was so cliché and had been done so many times that it was a huge let down seeing how original and great the rest of it was...When I boil it down though I would suggest you watch it.

Doesn't Quite Stick the Landing But Still Very Good,"The 'Bad Times at the El Royale' before that existed movie, Identity, is a mind-bending mystery involving a group of people stranded at a motel in Nevada in the midst of a terrible storm. In other words, the perfect elements for a mystery writer. Luckily, the film never dives too deep into over-the-top storytelling like it easily could but rather a dark psychological undertone, reminiscent of Nolan's Memento only a few years prior. The only problem is that with any mystery, the film is only as good as its final reveal. Identity's is solid but not nearly as satisfying as it builds itself out to be. Still worth watching.7.3/10",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"""It's your birthday next week? It's my birthday next week. The 10th""","""Identity"" is not the film I expected. Unfortunately, I found it quite banal. Initially seeing the length of the film I thought ""From 90 minutes of thriller finally something interesting and that will not bore me for sure"". Well, the film has bored me instead. Sometimes it is too heavy, with repeated scenes. The good things are there, though. The setting of the motel in a thunderstorm night is perfect, the actors were decent but the film lacks something. The characters are too hasty, only a few are explored while others are hidden and do not excite you. Mangold's direction is quite good, with tension shots, music, scenes and use of lights appropriate to the genre and setting. I have an opinion about this film: ""Identity"" is a film that should be simple. In my opinion, you don't always need to overdo it with complex plots, hardly credible endings and absurd or anything. This film if I made simply by exposing a story about 10 people trapped in a motel with a killer inside would have been more compelling, although the idea itself is acceptable. There are, however, writing features that I liked with many references that lead you to understand how it will end. But there is also a flaw in the end: I think that in a film so confused you have to give a more precise and decisive final solution, able to clearly understand what was the purpose of the characters and the director. In any case I will certainly review this film to understand it better and maybe appreciate it more, but for now I have honestly little to say and everything I think I wrote up here..

"His story's so unbelievable, I think it just might be true.","Identity is directed by James Mangold and written by Michael Cooney. It stars John Cusack, Ray Liotta, Amada Peet, Clea DuVall, Rebecca De Mornay, Alfred Molina, John Hawkes, John C. McGinley, Jake Busey and Pruitt Taylor Vince. Music is by Alan Silvestri and cinematography by Phedon Papamichael Jr.Inspired by Agatha Christie's Ten Little Indians, Identity pitches 10 characters trapped at a motel who begin getting killed off one by one...If you are going to do yet another take on Christies superb literary source then at least bring some freshness, so how nice to find that Identity does in fact ironically have its own. Set up is suitably in keeping with murder mystery shenanigans, there's major flooding and our host of characters are bound to a shabby motel run by a shabby John Hawkes. On the edges of the frame we have another story where multiple killer Malcolm Rivers (the wonderful wobbly eyed P.T. Vince) is under interrogation to test for insanity to stave off his impending execution.Mangold uses flashbacks to put the various characters at the motel, in how they came to be there. There's a creative ambitiousness about how Mangold constructs the pic that draws you in, which come the finale will either have you satiated or stupefied. The murder sequences are very well put together, with a couple being well ghoulish, and it's a very impressive cast of actors working their way through the formulaic but fascinatingly cheat free psychological murk.It's not as smart as it thinks it is but this has enough of an absorbing pull, and no little intelligence, to lift it higher than many other Agatha 10 copies. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A twist to far,"When I heard that Identity lends a lot of the Classic Agatha Christie novel Ten Little Niggers my curiosity was aroused.  I like this novel very much, but never really saw a good presentation on film. This movie does start off as a take on the novel: ten people are stranded in a remote location, they all have something in common and then the killing starts.  It's quite suspenseful and keeps you wondering who the killer is. But there are little hints and another storyline that makes you suspect something else might be afoot.Then all of a sudden half way through the movie you're hit on the forehead with an enormous revelation and plot twist of almost `Sixth Sense' proportions.  This changes the `who's the killer' routine completely and unfortunately also reduces the tension felt before the twist.  But still a very good thriller until the decision of the writers to put in another plot twist at the end that completely spoiled the movie for me.The performances in this movie are anything between average and very good, but it's John Cusack, who seems to get better with each movie, again who really carries the movie.  Both sound and vision are very well balanced to serve the mood of the story.So would I recommend this movie for your viewing pleasure?  I would even with that extra twist at the end that spoiled it for me.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

At the same time I believe it has all the qualities of a top notch thriller. It is not ""12 Angry Men"" but it is just really really great at what it tries to achieve.

Very entertaining and will leave you guessing and excited the entire time,"I went into this movie completely blind. I didn't look for a review, a trailer or even a description. I was searching for something similar to Psycho when I stumbled across this particular gem. It was suggested as ""similar to Psycho"" on a random website and I just picked it up.
I watched it with a couple of friends later the same day and I was a little nervous suggesting that we watch it. Mostly because it could be trash for all I knew.I knew and liked some of the cast from other movies I had watched in the past and that gave me hope that it could be good.Then began the movie - as soon as it had started, the tape recordings had me instantly hooked.What I didn't expect was to enjoy the movie as much as we did. The plot was very engaging and suspenseful and kept us glued to our seats.

Trapped, inescapable characters in a slasher movie? Always works great.What followed was wild and not completely predictable and at one point suggested that something supernatural might be at play since there was no other way the events could be explained.I did predict parts of it but the ending still left me surprised.To conclude, I'll say that Identity is a very entertaining movie and will leave you guessing and excited the entire time.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A twisty take on And Then There Were None with a solid ensemble cast and psychological edge,"At an isolated Nevada Motel, former cop turned limo drive Ed Dakota (John Cusack), sex worker Paris Nevada (Amanda Peet), corrections officer Rhodes (Ray Liotta), and several others are forced to stay at this motel due to a storm that strands them there. However, one by one members of the group begin turning up dead, but are these truly random killings?Identity is a 2003 psychologically infused spin on the formula popularized by Agatha Christie's And Then There Were None written by screenwriter Michael Cooney who previously had penned direct-to-video films such as the two Jack Frost slashers. Acquired by Screen Gems initially, the movie's premise was deemed strong enough that development was shifted to Sony's higher end label Columbia. The movie became a sleeper hit opening at number one at the box office and making back $90 million against its $28 million budget and no doubt served as a boon for director James Mangold as it was his first bonafide hit since Cop Land and gave him the clout needed to make Walk the Line. Critical reception tended to skew mostly positive, but there was division on the nature of the twist with some, like Roger Ebert, appreciating it while others thought it was far fetched and convoluted. Me personally, I like Identity and found it to be suitably engrossing and twisty, but the third act shakeup will be a case of: you buy it or you don'tAs Identity begins, the movie gives us an introduction to our eclectic group of characters all played by reliable actors like John Hawkes, Jake Busey, John C. McGInley, and Rebecca De Mornay and while the characterization is very basic, they're still given the opportunity to make an impression so we're interested in these characters as they're picked off one by one. The first two thirds of the film operate like a standard locked room murder mystery only occasionally broken up by scenes involving a convicted murderer named Malcolm Rivers played by Pruitt Taylor Vince getting a late night re-evaluation to determine if he's eligible for a stay of execution. Malcolm Rivers becomes central to the third act of this movie and that's where the divide tends to take place where some like the twist while others find it stretched beyond the point of suspension of disbelief. While I do see why people are divided on it (in fact the ""mechanism"" of this twist isn't explained so it very much leaves that blank) within the context of a thriller I think it earns just enough leeway.Identity is a fast paced and fun thriller that takes its And Then There Were None inspired setup and goes in a bold direction with it. While the direction it goes will strain credibility with some for understandable reasons, it's undeniably memorable.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Identity,"Identity is a decent mystery thriller but for me fails to serve a complete and satisfying experience. Major issues are regarding the writing and directing. Coming from my first Mangold directed movie: Girl, Interrupted I was excitably looking forward to this as it seemed right up my alley. But sadly it became a let down.Right off the bat, what would've made this movie actually work would be great character dynamics combined with great dialog writing. Imo none of that is present here, it al feels wooden. Performances never hit their stride. The dialog is especially jarring, it's written in a way that moves the story, but not the way people would talk. And the scenario the story takes place in should not influence that either, that's not a argument.With the weak writing come okay performances, I don't really feel like anyone stood out. It was all very flat and plain. Maybe only Clea DuVall gets an honorable mention with some effort. But no-one else was memorable.The story is really interesting, and it really could be incredible in a better movie. But here it's balancing on mediocre to decent. The whole subplot redline is uninteresting. It again is plagued by bland performances.The directing. Now.. this is definitely a 2000s movie. And it did. Not. Age. Well. It's got those classic freeze frames. Which feel really out of place and odd, strangely paced. It starts a bit messy but eventually calms down, correctly. The setting is nice. The environment and ambience set is great. Though the location could've been more interesting, as a set it was quite claustrophobic. And the layout was never really clear. The stage wasn't properly set. Now as for runtime I think it hit the mark. Even though with all the flaws I was able to get through it and whilst I didn't love it at all. And especially a bummer after seeing the great ''Girl, interrupted'' this felt like a movie made by someone else completely.Yeah, just meh. So much potential left on the table.",5.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"well, identify the true identity","Rain splattering down all over, and blood giving it a close competition..... 10 ppl stuck in a dingy motel,one severely injured, one cop ,one convict and several shady characters included... and as expected suddenly a competition begins of who can get killed before whom and the countdown begins to give the gold medal to the struggling survivor....... But all of a sudden enters a mental patient,hence changing the entire ball game..... none the less, it's very entertaining.... and the twist in the tail,, really twists it painfully hard,, overall, nice thriller film...It did have it's funny moments though-- how can u kill someone by an overspeeding car when ur speedometer reads zero? How can a broken lock hold a door when 2 ppl were trying to choke-slam it, undertaker style?? there r many more, but i don't wanna give the spoilers here..So it's recommended to all those who liked films like-- shutter island, stay, Mulholland drive etc...",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A must see,"Identity is a film that has flown under the radar for far too long. Released in 2003, this gripping mystery thriller was met with moderate box office success and mixed reviews from critics. However, upon re-examination, it's clear that ""Identity"" is a masterfully crafted film that deserves to be reappraised as a modern classic.One of the standout aspects of ""Identity"" is its expertly woven narrative. Mangold's script, penned by Michael Cooney, is a complex web of twists and turns, which slowly unravels as the story progresses. The film's pacing is deliberate and measured, building tension and suspense through a series of cleverly constructed set pieces.The cast of ""Identity"" is equally impressive, with a talented ensemble delivering performances that are both nuanced and emotionally resonant. John Cusack, Ray Liotta, and Amanda Peet shine as three strangers who find themselves trapped in a remote motel during a torrential rainstorm. As the night wears on, they begin to realize that they are not alone, and that a killer may be among them.However, what truly sets ""Identity"" apart is its clever use of misdirection. Mangold's film is a masterclass in suspense, expertly manipulating the audience's perceptions and expectations. Just when you think you know what's going on, the rug is pulled out from under you, and the story takes a dramatic turn.The film's climax is both shocking and satisfying, a clever twist that ties together the various threads of the narrative. It's a testament to Mangold's skill as a storyteller that he's able to pull off this twist without feeling cheap or manipulative.One of the most impressive aspects of ""Identity"" is its ability to balance suspense and humor. The film's script is full of clever one-liners and witty banter, which helps to break the tension and add some much-needed levity to the proceedings.Identity is a film that deserves to be rediscovered and reappreciated. It's a masterclass in suspense, a clever exercise in misdirection, and a gripping mystery that will keep you on the edge of your seat.If you haven't seen ""Identity"" before, do yourself a favor and seek it out.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"If You Take Identity And Subtract The Awful Ending, You Have A Pretty Good Movie","I thought that overall, ""Identity"" was pretty good. Nothing more than that....but nothing less. You have to admit, it's pretty unique and not like all the other horror movies out there. Some of the most recent horror films that I have seen lately are similar if not identical to other horror movies, which can get pretty annoying. For example, one of the newer ones, ""House of Wax."" Sure it was good too, but for all of you who have seen it don't you think it's almost exactly like ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre?!"" A group of teens driving along, their car breaks down, they stop, meet up with some creepy old man, and eventually there is only one or two survivors out of the whole group. YEESH. Anyways, back to this movie. The acting was done pretty well, and basically the movie was great up until the end. I kind of figured out who was responsible way before it reached the end. But I won't let that take away from the fact that, yeah, overall it was a pretty decent movie. 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
First half=Amazing. Second half=Not so much.,"Identity was a great thriller. It very much reminded me of something that David Fincher would make. It had all these elements that make for an excellent thriller, just combine that with some good characters, great acting, and wah-lah! It was something else.Having said that, I should point out that the key word in that summary was, well, ""was"". Identity ""was"" a great thriller, until we came close to the end. Then all the poop started spilling out.The basic plot of the film goes a little something like this: While driving an actress to her destination, a limo driver accidentally ends up in a car accident. The woman in the car is hurt terribly, while her son and husband are unscathed (physically, anyway). So they hitch a ride with a young couple to the nearest motel in hopes to escape the rain and treat the woman's wounds. That same night, a cop happens to stop by with a convict in tow. After the night rolls on a bit, the convict eventually escapes and starts picking off the people one by one.Let me first start off by saying this: What in all of hell were they thinking with that twist? That was one of the most ridiculous, convoluted, silly twists I've ever seen. The first half of this movie was amazing. It had a great atmosphere, great acting, and great suspense. Once the twist was revealed, it was all downhill from there. I think that if they had spent just a teency bit more time with the script, they could've seriously made some changes that would've benefited this movie greatly.Aside from those aspects of the movie, there are some things that do help it. For one thing, the acting is pretty damn good. John Cusack, Ray Liotta, Amanda Peet, John Hawkes, and John C. McGinley all give great performances. The only people I didn't like were that stupid young couple. All the chick ever did was whine and scream while the boyfriend was just some idiot d-bag.Director James Mangold (director of two films I love: Walk the Line and 3:10 to Yuma) definitely knew what he was going for tone-wise and pace-wise with the movie. The tone is very effective and serves the movie greatly. One of the reasons I said this reminded me of something Fincher would make was because it had that same sort-of lighting. You know, that greenish tint. The film moved along fine until the end, when they just kept piling on the twists and made you feel exasperated.Overall, despite my gripes with that stupid twist, I still say that Identity is at least worth a rental, if not just catching it on TV, like I did. An OK movie, not a great one like it could've been.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"almost a great film, but with cheap lousy ending","This is in many ways an excellent movie. Although it pretends to be deeper than it really is, it is still smart, stylish, extremely well made, neatly paced, with strong performances from all the actors.Yet I must lodge a complaint. It's the ending. Difficult to explain what goes wrong here without revealing it, so I'll write in generalities. By the end of the film, when the pieces at last begin to fit together, we come to feel some compassion for the characters that we know are essentially decent and we learn to wish the best for them. The ending betrays that, and is thus annoying and disappointing. Whatever first went wrong with the killer here happens yet again. Life's just a joke, after all, and a rather cruel one.This is not only unfair to the characters, but to the audience as well. a less violent ending would not have betrayed the heart of the film, but would instead have reached the depth the film pretends to seek.Definitely worth the trip, but might be more satisfying if you just skip the last five minutes.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Tough to ID this one!,"`Identity' valiantly tries to replicate an identity of various Alfred Hitchcock's suspenseful classics. However, the results for the most part is an identity crisis. Ok! Let me get to `Identity's' identity: several unrelated group of suspicious characters hibernate to a highway motel on a rainy evening (`Psycho' anyone?) and before you know it the body count commences. I am sure you can identify with some films that present the same violentiosco plot. The actors in `Identity' are renowned and easy to identify: John Cusack, Ray Liotta, Amanda Peet, Alfred Molina, and Rebecca De Mornay. However, this acting ensemble was mostly middling here. `Identity' was suspenseful in several homage Hitchcockian scenes. However, the problem was that Director James Mangold became a bit psychotic with the multitudinous repetition of them. Mangold turned out to be `The Man Who Knew Too Little' about direction in this project. He was `Notorious'! `Identity' identifies several suspenseful elements of effective storytelling, but for the most part this one was for `The Birds'. *** Average",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Twists for the sake of twists are wearing thin.,"""Identity"" is yet another movie that thinks a ""SHOCKING TWIST"" is better than a good narrative.  I have had it up to here with movies that continue to play the ol' ""pull the rug out from under the audience"" trick when the ONLY purpose behind it is for the sake of the twist/shock itself.""Identity"" actually is quite good for about an hour.  At one point, one of the characters even makes reference to ""movies that gather strangers together and kill them off one by one only to find out later that there was some connection between them.""  Well, I WISH this movie would have gone with the formula instead of trying to outthink itself.  The result is a major backfire and one of the worst final 20 minutes in film history.  What genuine suspense there was for the first hour of the film completely vanished in the final 20 minutes.I find myself constantly saying, ""It's too bad the movie stunk because I really like John Cusack.""  Well guess what?  I am tired of saying that and now feel compelled to say that Cusack the actor -- while talented -- is a terrible judge of what is a good movie and what isn't.  How many bad movies is this recently for him?Pretentious critics will embrace this stylish ""exercise,"" but more intelligent and sophisticated film audiences will not be taken in by a movie that clearly had no idea what to do in the final act, other than to be different for the sake of being different.Movies with great twists -- The Sting, The Usual Suspects, The Sixth Sense -- all had great screenplays that never cheated the audience and held up under scrutiny later.  They also turned very very good screenplays into great screenplays.  But movies that resort to twists just for the sake of them are doing their audience and themselves a great disservice.  We and they (in some cases) deserve a lot better.",1.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Familiar but well made,"This is one of those films that thank god doesn't meander to the shallow thinking of teens and young adults. It stays true to the script and original story without having a predictable (For the most part) ending tacked on. Here's a story that definitely is not what it seems. Story starts out with John Cusack as Ed. A limo driver and former police officer that is driving a movie star named Caroline Suzanne (Rebecca DeMornay) but its night and its in the middle of a violent storm and Ed accidently hits a woman in the road. Her husband is fixing a flat and their son Timmy (Bret Loehr) is in the back seat. They drive to a motel and try and use the phone but all the lines are down and the next town is 30 miles away and they cannot drive out because of the flooding. Others soon arrive because of the storm like a prostitute named Paris (Amanda Peet), A young couple who just got married, and a cop named Rhodes (Ray Liotta) who is transporting a prisoner (Jake Busey). They are all stuck and later the prisoner escapes. It doesn't take long before some of the group start popping up murdered or disappeared. Meanwhile, another part of the film has a midnight hearing on a killer who is scheduled to die the next day and his doctor (Alfred Molina) is trying to convince the judge that he is insane and didn't know what he was doing. The film is directed by James Mangold (Heavy, Cop Land, Girl Interrupted) and this is another good effort by him and he's slowly building a pretty impressive resume. I was one of those thinking that I was walking into just another thriller but this film is definitely not that. Instead, as the film unfolds it give you twists and turns that seemingly go into a strange direction until you find out what the real source of the story is. But even when you understand the basis of the story it gives you reasons to think. Fairly clever film is somewhat familiar like a ""Twilight Zone"" episode or maybe something by Brian DePalma so even though it keeps you guessing it dawns on you that similar material has been done like this before. It doesn't detract from this being well directed and shot. The cinematography is well handled with the constant rain being the main source for establishing an effective mood. All the actors are up to the task but its the direction and script that the emphasis should be laid upon. Good effective thriller that has a lot more going for it under the surface.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"With a World of Better Direction, This Could Have Been a Lot Better","Identity has the wild unpredictability of the essential horror film, set at a timeworn motel in the middle of nowhere. The only guests have only stopped there because of the same freak accident. Alas, it falls through every cliché trapdoor on the blueprint, entirely preventable ones, too, ones that won't open unless you consciously open them, and its wild unpredictability is relegated to merely an offshoot of its absurdity. We still have fun, and, yes, it is still eerie sometimes, but it too much wants to be our friend. It has a star-studded cast of actors we love, the way it gets to its mindblow twist is through a ridiculous and completely avoidable contrivance in dialogue and moreover, the score is too often superfluous, signaling what we are supposed to feel, and as a consequence we don't have to feel it if we don't want to. The film would have been much more effective, far-fetched points and all, if the tension were allowed to grow genuinely rather than be explained by the underscoring.It has been too long since we've seen the unbelievably sexy Rebecca DeMornay in a mainstream film. Had her performance in The Hand That Rocks the Cradle not been a wake- up call for filmmakers, the very kind that like to makes movies like this? Ray Liotta can by now play this kind of role in his sleep. Alfred Molina is hardly a part of the action and does not get to have the kind of fun as he does with so many other roles, but that is no matter for us simply to joy in seeing him. There is also the character actor John C. McGinley in a high- strung dramatic role, having never before been boring anyway. So this seemingly ambitious psychological thriller has star power which results in our immediate enjoyment instead of our deep involvement.Yes, we are truly wondering how this and that could possibly happen, or who could possibly be responsible, and if so, how? Its script is one step away from being ludicrous with cheap pseudo-impressive buy-offs, but depending on the audience, one could either take the bait and be wowed or laugh out loud at its final unraveling, which is what I did. Basically, you can see that the certitude lies in the hands of a skillful enough director, and, with a world of better direction than James Mangold's, this could have been a lot better.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Factory blues,"Identity is about the most we can hope for from the drivel cranked out by Hollywood these days.  Remake an already established property, maybe provide a slight alteration for contemporary audiences, slap on a few big names and hope the audience takes the bait, which they usually do since their dying for just about anything that's even halfway palatable.  It's also, I think, the fourteenth version of Agatha Christie's ""Ten Little Indians"".I like John Cusack a lot.  Now that he's getting maybe fortyish, his face is acquiring more maturity and his overall presentation more humanity and depth.  His scene where he tells the ""slut"" (Amanda Peet) his reason for leaving the police force is particularly compelling.  Miss Peet is also good as the ""screamer"", the unlucky girl caught in the swill of events, and Ray Liotta does his wacko cop routine to great effectiveness. But a knockoff of Ten Little Indians is still a knockoff of Ten Little Indians, and the psychological ""twist"" that makes this version supposedly unique is something that you will remember for about as long as it takes to get to your car.  2 1/2 ** out of 4",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery

I found it an interesting tribute to PSYCHO, the mother of all demented slasher films but it also owes a lot to Ten Little Indians and other classic who dunits. Where identity deviates is in it's original twist(which I will not spoil) at the end. The acting throughout by all involved is exceptional, especially Cusack and Peet. There are some lapses in logic in the third act, the transporting of a serial killer by such careless methods doesn't ring true but we must suspend disbelief for the sake of the ending.

Overrated imo,"Randomly had this movie pop-up on IMDB and after reading the description figured I'd give it a go. A whodunit style movie with good actors? Ok.

But man, the ending and overall story once the ""twist"" is revealed is bad. Like others said, why open the screen and not pull the vehicle over? Where's backup? Driving in middle of desert on empty road? What? Maybe this passed audience reviews and wasn't noticed back in early 2000s but it doesn't anymore. Just too unbelievable.

This being said, if you're just as ""easy-going"" as I am in that respect, you might find as I did that this little-advertised movie deserves its place on the podium of a genre (or sub-genre - ""thriller with a supernatural, almost metaphysical twist"") whose recent successes included most notably Frailty, The Others, Sixth Sense and Unbreakable, and more miscellaneously Abre Los Ojos / Vanilla Sky. Like those, it boasts an impeccable direction and cast, a very enjoyable, if borderline formulaic, first part, and a deeply satisfying and most memorable ""cherry on the cake"" in the form of said final twist.

This is an underrated modern day masterpiece,"Identity (2003) is a movie in my DVD collection that I recently rewatched on Tubi. The storyline involves a man on death row being transported one rainy night when the road floods and the officer transporting him has to pull over to a hotel filled with people experiencing the same issue. A series of unfortunate events start happening around the hotel; meanwhile, the characters feel strangely connected but they can't figure out how.

The cast in this movie is outstanding as is their dialogue and back forth. The horror elements are so good, intense and gory while doing a great job of hiding the killer's identity. I found it easy to root for multiple characters in this film while thinking multiple characters could be the killer.

"Promising Start, Cheap Ending","With a stellar who's who cast of greats from yesterday and today, and a beginning that wastes no time, this movie looked and felt like a classic. I say 'felt' like a classic because for the first half hour I felt tight and uneasy, and whenever a film evokes queasiness I know its bound to be a winner. But it took the cheap, cliched way out after the first hour or so.The basic plot involves a bunch of strangers more or less thrown together under various circumstances in a Nevada Motel due to a bad storm. They are soon forced to work together when a few from their small group begin turning up dead. Thats all I have to say about that.The colorful combo include Cusack the efficient limo driver, DeMornay the stuck up actress he is chauffeuring, Liotta the no nonsense cop with the son of Gary Busey as his prisoner in transport, Peet the prostitute with a plan, a jerky hotel manager named Larry, a young unhappily married couple, and a boy in a bad state.What frightened me the most was when May 10 was worked in as a pertinent date to the plot, I realized that was indeed the present date! (as I sit here and write this on May 10, hours after I saw it) I couldn't help but feel a dose of religion and superstition (same thing to me)If you like feeling a little sick and rattled for an hour or so, this movie is worth seeing.

Finding one's own personality in the rain at the roach motel...,"James Mangold is an interesting director to watch if he has the right material to work with.

To say that it is confusing to the average person, is to put it mildly.

"An unpredictable, shocking, thrilling, edge-of-your-seat twister.","I am hard pressed to maintain a sterile review without giving away spoilers because IDENTITY is filled with surprises, twists and shocks that even veteran film critics did not see coming. Ten years after watching this film, I watched it again and believe me, I enjoyed this roller-coaster of a movie just like I did the first time.Inspired by Agatha's Christie's ""And Then There Were None"", Michael Cooney's phenomenal story will have you strapped in your seat from the gruesome beginning all through to the gruesome end. The setup is a desolate motel in the Nevada desert where ten strangers will face their darkest and final hours, all before the night is over. Lashed by a violent thunderstorm, the motel comes alive when a man (John C. McGinley) rushes in seeking urgent medical attention for his wife (Leila Kenzie). By his side is their little boy Timothy (Bret Loehr). The family is helped by a limo driver (John Cusack) and a reluctant movie star (Rebecca DeMornay) he was driving before coming to their aid. A cop (Ray Liotta) transporting a chained prisoner (Jake Busey) also stops for the night. The downpour also sweeps in a newly married couple (William Lee Scott and Clea DuVall) and a Las Vegas prostitute (Amanda Peet). With the phone lines down and electricity on the blink, they prepare to wait out the storm. Elsewhere, convicted serial killer Malcolm Rivers (Pruitt Taylor Vince) is about to be executed when his psychiatrist Dr. Mallick (Alfred Molina) discovers a journal. Rivers' journal throws new light on his conviction and Mallick calls for an eleventh-hour hearing on preventing the execution. Meanwhile our guests at the motel are being killed in a peculiar pattern, one by one, by an unknown murderer.As they turn on each other to unmask the killer, director James Mangold opens a huge can of perfectly blended suspense and mystery while leaving the viewer with some very unavoidable questions. Is it the prisoner? Is it the weird motel clerk? Is it a character lurking in the shadows? And the most baffling question of all – What is the connection between Malcolm Rivers' hearing and the on-going butchery in a motel set in an entirely different location? Believe it or not, these are questions Mangold and Cooney have cleverly crafted just to pull the rug under your feet. Even if you have been watching and listening carefully, there is only the slimmest possibility you will find the answers before the director starts to untangle the mystery. This revelation is set at the beginning of the third act, with 30 minutes or so remaining, but perfectly timed to have the viewer's thoughts racing back to the beginning. Of course, by this time you will have either figured it out or you will be defenseless for Mangold's final blow. This is also when the narrative shifts from a whodunit to pure psychological horror with an omnipresent trace of the supernatural.Leading an all-star cast, Cusack does a sensational job and along with Peet (they would co-star again in the apocalyptic 2012) maintains the sheer momentum of this plot twister. Liotta, Busey and John Hawes (as the motel clerk) add to the mystery but as you will find, these are small but vital blips in the bigger picture. In all, everyone does their part and at times appear to be a bit comical with characters shouting and screaming in tandem with the rising tension. Even so, this is merely the calm before the storm while the director gives you a little time to take in what is happening. If you liked the way THE SIXTH SENSE or SESSION 9 came crashing down on you, IDENTITY will do the same but the surprises keep coming at you instead of just one major twist reserved for the end. I think I have said enough. Anymore and I might give into the temptation of revealing the film's darkest but well kept secrets.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Clichés Can Still Be Spooky Fun,"""Identity"" not only plays on stereotypes, it considers them classic references -- the dark and stormy night setting at a run-down desert motel with a snarky manager, strangers with secrets gathering, and so on -- that let you in on the jokes and twists for an entertaining pretzel.I hope the DVD will have footnotes for all the intentional movie references, from ""Psycho,"", to ""Three Faces of Eve,"" ""10 Little Indians,"" and even ""Sunset Boulevard,"" etc.I'm sure others guessed the ending, but I kept being distracted enough to not think that far ahead.This could just have easily been a cable TV movie or PBS ""Mystery"" episode, but the ""A"" list cast, including John Cusack and Ray Liotta, classes the joint up. I assume Amanda Peet appreciated finally being able to keep her blouse on in a movie, even if she is playing a prostitute.Good production design for that seedy motel and the music doesn't interfere.This will make a nice spooky video rental when you're in the mood.",,Anonymous,Mystery

In a pouring down rainstorm 10 unrelated travelers find themselves seeking shelter in an isolated motel and proceed to die, one by one.

Great film,"This movie was excellent. I went into the theater not expecting much, because there simply wasnt much playing. I came out of the theater shocked by the quality of the film I had just seen. The acting was good, the cinematography was good, but where the film really shines is in its intricate plot. You are never really sure who the killer is in the movie, and when you find out in the end, it is a real shock. Also, this is the only movie I can think of that includes a red herring. That is, something that has absolutely nothing to do with the plot, it has absolutely no relevance to the movie, the only point of its existance is to trick you into believing it does have some importance. I thought that was great. I was thoroughly entertained and I highly recommend this movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

A good solid thriller.,"This isn't a great film but it is a good one.The performances are all good with the 3 main characters, Cusack, Liotta and Peet, all being convincing and the supporting cast all delivering as required.There are a few twists and turns and some good suspenseful moments but it is mostly quite light-weight fare.The twist in the tale is not hugely interesting or surprising but the rest of the film is entertaining enough to keep you watching happily.This is a simple easy to watch film without any real need for thought.

BEST movie I have seen in a long time...,"This was a really great movie.  It had a great story line and it kind of makes you wonder where its going and then hits you in the face, and you realize how it all ties together.  It is one of the best psychological thrillers I have ever seen.  I am a psychology major, so I think I picked up on it a little earlier than some people towards the end, but my roommate said he caught on later.  John Cusack is great in this film and he takes on a different sort of character than he has in recent non-romantic films or comedies.  It is an all around great movie, my only criticism is maybe it could've been a little longer.  I highly recommend it.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Here Honey, you hold the room key","Greetings again from the darkness.  Highly anticipated ""thriller"" that for the most part, fails to deliver.  More slasher than thriller.  The psychological aspect held great promise and intrigue, but was handled poorly.  Director James Mangold continues with his run of disappointing films, including ""Kate & Leopold"", ""Girl, Interrupted"" and ""Cop Land"".  He does have some visual style, but lacks the ability to add substance to his work.  Cusack and Liotta are strong in their roles, and Amanda Peet is surprisingly effective as the young dreamer.  The always great Alfred Molina provides excellent work in relief, and an almost unrecognizable Rebecca DeMornay has a quick turn as a a woman who ""used to be that actress"".  Gotta love those that can poke fun at themselves.  Speaking of fun, many of the death scenes generate outloud laughter from the audience due to the unbelievable nature.  Overall this film steals from the best - Psycho, The Omen, The Sixth Sense, Carrie, The Fury and Ten Little Indians.  The problem is those were all very strong scripts that were filmed brilliantly, whereas ""Identity"" seems to avoid the one topic that could have provided the film with its own 'identity'.  Focus on the internal battle of personalities could have been the key to setting this one apart.  Instead, it is just another slasher with a nice cast.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Bravo Bravo,I'm not one who likes to know too much about a film before I watch it. Just tell me the genre and be vague about the synopsis. I like for the movie itself to tell me the story.

Just when you thought twist-movies had improved... *minor spoilers*,"I picked this movie up at Blockbuster after having been recommended it a long time ago. The beginning looked somewhat promising, and I enjoyed the use of a non-linear time-line. The way the many characters were brought together was even kind of clever(even though it's basically just a bunch of people driving in cars at the same place at the same time). Most of the accidents in the beginning was kind of dumb and even a tad staged; most of them seemed to have been easily avoided if the drivers would just pay attention to the road instead of doing everything else at once. Don't consider that a spoiler; it all happens within the first five minutes or so. The plot quickly turns into a regular 'Who Done It', with even the least attentive viewers being able to figure out the order in which order the people get whacked. The pacing tries to be intense, but fails to be so past the first ten minutes. I could barely keep paying attention to it. Up to the very end, this seemed to be a well-done and pretty but ultimately very pedestrian mystery-thriller, with no real surprises. Then came the twist. And it got so much worse. Not only was the twist easy to figure out and a horrible cop-out, it ruined everything the movie had built up(as little as there was) to that point. It kicked down every brick of the foundation of the film. Even worse, the film goes on for about fifteen minutes past that. And here's the real kicker; there's another twist. Even more painful, and even more predictable. You have been warned. If you still have any wish to see this movie at any point, I will objectively review what I haven't reviewed already. The characters are diverse and interesting, and they have a fair amount of development each. The cast does contain some very talented people, unfortunately, too few of them are given anything to do. Jake Busey and John C. McGinley are criminally underused. The film contains a few genuine scares and some decent enough guessing of the killer's identity. I recommend it to fans of the actors and people who enjoy the genres. Just be prepared for a pitifully bad twist ending. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Another journey to a serial killer's mind... A mindless popcorn flick,"Each Friday night of my teenagehood years passed with watching Horror classics. When the mysterious killer reveals out to be a child of my age or even younger, that had always gotten me into an excitement. Watching ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" was a proof of mine, saying ""-Look, I'm totally grown up, now. I don't afraid of Freddy any more. Huh huh!"" , to mum.Time's changed. Horror genre is strengthened by mindless mysteries and sentimentalism. This new type of horror can't make viewers laugh or have fun any more. If not getting any fun from a horror, why watching it? The plot is solely good for mystery; yet the director chose to make a horror/teen slasher, which happened to be a fallacious deduction. Directing and editing is totally awful. ""Identity"" is talented director James Mangold's worst movie. From 1995 to 2005, his first decade of industrial movie making experience had caught everybody's attention. The present time is 2009. His latest works ""Walk The Line"" and ""3:10 to Yuma"" scored success both on box-office and on film critics. I wish we won't see any disappointment from him any more.Reminiscent of Agatha Christie's ""And There Were None""(1945), Hitchcock's Psycho and Kubrick's idea of mystery at Indian cemetery; there is no such thing as an original idea. The opening scene sparks off a traffic accident profits from each character's view of the accident. No one was guilty. Followed by coincidences 8 adult, 1 child and the runner of the motel got stuck in a deluge. The story telling was as good as 2004's best motion picture winner ""Crash"". Differently, they never tried to break free from their situation. Instead, they make each other fall into a calamity. After two more coincidences, we learned as a third coincidence that everyone shares the same birthday. 10 people, all of them, have born on the 10th of May. Then Amanda Peet tried to save the situation: ""This place used to be an Indian cemetery"".Even before the first half of the movie, it happened to become a comedy by a chain of disasters and coincidences. Thanks to Alan Silvestri, who has composed a good music score. Watching for the reason to learn what's going to happen at the end, has been the key factor that made viewers think this is better than an average movie. Quite frankly, it is not. Film editing is dreadful.1 out of 10 for editing. 8 out of 10 for acting. When you come to the end, you'll realize that it's not the movie you're watching any more. It's so easy that when a director puts all the different puzzles and mysteries altogether mixing them with some sentimentalism, and when at the end his leading actor says:""Sorry, I am a paranoiac. I was only dreaming. Nothing really happened. Everything was just a dream.""",5.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Brilliant work a la Stephen King,"I believe I watched this movie under just the right 'setup'; around 4AM in my dark four-waller flat. Now I must say that I got this feeling - about what was going to be the very end - already when the 'team' arrived at the motel. I guess it'll all about having a great movie-intuition -brag- However, the movie was great, with lots of sudden turns, just the way we want these sorts of 'mysterical thrillers' to go by. I recommend this movie to everyone above the age of 13. It needs some thinking. Don't take it too far though, or you'll have yourself sleepless thinking' ""What was _really_ happening"" after you've seen it ;)Regards, G.",,Anonymous,Mystery
a rare film that respects its audience,"First of all, if you have not already watched this film, then you have no business reading reviews. Go watch it, it's short, fast-paced, has an intelligent plot and creative cinematography.On paper, Identity belongs to the group of films that offer twist after twist and nothnig else, but looking deeper I think it's fair to say that this is not the case. Early in the film, there is a scene when the main character Ed (John Cusack) catches a glimpe of another building and when he enters that building he finds out that he is somehow at the same motel they were staying in. This scene presents us two possible scenarios: First, a weird Sci-fi approach to the story that would end up in a Lost-esque situation where the motel is the centre of the world. But we don't get anymore Sci-fi elements and there simply isn't enough evidence to support such theory.The second scenario is that we are witnessing and the people in the film are dealing with a world that is dream-like and imaginative. Put this hypothesis along the story of Malcolm Rivers and his trials and the fact that these two stories are bound to merge into another as some point. As we progress through the film this proposed scenario becomes more and more acceptable and satisfactory and the supposed twists become just rational and reasonable unfoldings of the story.In my opinion, Identity tries something different, something smart, thought-provoking. The filmamkers have done a rare feat in creaing a film that is both twisty and respectful.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Life and people intersect and connect thru another's identity a complex and interesting mystery.,"Just recently watched ""Identity"" once again and still after all these years it is one mystery that's interesting and complex you leave thinking was the film a nightmare or a real mind game of identity change gone wrong. It's always been true that people intersect with one another and in someway they have a connection, yet this film shows it in the strangest way it's thru the identity of a crazy killer.Anyway enough of the plot theme and point the story is interesting and the film has a mystery feel from the very start. As along the Nevada desert during a rainy night a group of strangers come together as their paths all cross at a rundown motel. Among them are a burned out ex cop and now limo driver(John Cusack)a washed up and past her prime 80's TV star(Rebecca DeMornay)and a crooked cop(Ray Liotta)who has a transported prisoner(Jake Busey)and a sexy and beautiful escort type call girl(Amanda Peet who looked so fine in that sexy black red colored bra!)and rounding out the group is a pair of newlyweds and a family in a crisis who all take shelter at the motel ran by a strange manager(John Hawkes).Thru the night personal demons and secrets are revealed some the same and some deadly, clearly this is one strange and crazy mystery of connection an intersection of identity and mind changing games.

Good but feels like cheat.,"""Identity"" is another well played cat and mouse game.  The most enjoyable aspect of this film is James Mangold assured direction, while the film never really gets past cheap scare tactics.

IDENTITY was in exquisite film with so much detail and story. 10/10 recommend,"PROS: This movie was such an amazing find. To start off, the way the characters interacted was unbelievably thought out and intricate. There wasn't a single actor that didn't do or say something without a purpose. The way everything was strung together, from character interaction to plot lines, was completely flawless. You were never bored and you were never directly given any answer. What I really like is when you are forced to think with the characters, not for them. It allows the watcher to become invested in the film. Not only was I invested for some of the film, but I was captivated by the whole film from beginning to end. There wasn't a single scene that dragged or didn't have a purpose. This includes the resolution which, if I might add, was the best ending to any movie I've seen in the past month. The last thing that I'll add was how spectacular the actors were. I loved the cast and the raw emotion that they showed. With such a large cast it's hard to find a good actor for each role, but IDENTITY did that.CONS: This con might not seem like a big deal, but it is very important to me. The trailer was very poorly put together. I pick which movies I watch based on trailers, and I almost didn't pick this one because of its poor editing and plot description. It's not important to everyone, but I review films from on screen to off screen, and the trailer is what sells, therefore I must review that too.www.chorror.com",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Mind Bender,"Not a bad little mind bender. Decent acting, solid cast, and a good enough story. Identity plays well all the way through and is worth sticking around for the end. It's no Se7en or Fight Club but it is an interesting take on the criminally insane. Some points are over the top but I guess they had to be to make 90mins worth it. Not a bad flick.

"Confusing, Confusing, Confusing!","Identity is the kind of movie that leaves you scratching your head trying to figure out what you just saw.  It contains so many plot twists, that it will make your head spin.  However, it is not a bad movie by any means.  It either took a real genius to come up with this story or a total wacko, I can't seem to figure out which.The very begining of the film gives you the feeling of ""Final Destination"" and then suddenly switches to the Norman Bates Psycho mode.  Some bizarre killings begin to take place and of course as most horror and mystery stories do the characters try and pin the killings on each other.The film doesn't get extremely confusing til the very end where you can't figure out what actually happened and if anything did at all. The overall conclusion makes you feel cheated in a way and sort of let down because the writer couldn't think of anything better or maybe it is truely a fantastic ending and his intelligence is far beyond the average person's.Who knows? 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Who else is confused...?,"Great movie, great script, great acting, great directing, where's the plot? And how about an explanation for what just happened?  There was a lot of blood.  For what?  I guess I was lost.  Someone told me that it was a psychological thriller, and more to the point, just a movie, and so you can't truly get it....but tell me!  Seriously, the movie had me all excited to finally figure out what the purpose for all the killing and clues, for what?  I guess I'm just venting, because they led me up for something I thought would be a great ending, and it turned out I got jipped.  I'm so glad I didn't go pay to see this, although in all honesty I liked the movie a lot, it was just that the last fifteen minutes made me really angry.John Cusack and Ray Liota are so good in this movie I want to scream. Okay, maybe I'm exaggerating a bit, but they really were very good. I was extremely impressed with Amanda Peet as well.  She always seemed like a bit of a light weight to me in most of her roles, but she did a really good job in this one (except that her accent tended to fade in and out at times.  Where was she supposed to be from again?  Florida, living in Nevada with a Tennessee accent?).And finally, Clea DuVall.  She is such an underrated actress, I can't believe how few widely known films she's actually done.  You may remember her from The Faculty, with Josh Hartnett and Elijah Wood.  One of her bigger roles.  Or how about the stuck up teen painter from She's All That, that tries to convince Cook's character to kill herself? She was also in The Astronaut's Wife, she played Charlize Theron's sister. She's been doing these small roles for a while now, and you can really see her raw talent in this movie.  I love her!  She should do so many more movies, and I think she was one of the best actresses/actors in this film. She really helped make it work.  Without her (granted it still probably would have been a good movie, but) it wouldn't have been the same.I give this movie, 10 being the highest a 7.5.  Just 'cause it p***ed me off that they didn't do as good a job explaining the ending as they should have. I hate it when they do that.  But, it was a good story overall and a really good watch. There's some blood, a head here and there, and more than one car accident (I.E. people get killed in this movie beware.), so if you don't like those kinds of films, and because you see John Cusack on the cover and think ""America's Sweethearts"", think again...it 'aint the sequel to that.

the first 3/4th were pretty good,"The first 3/4th of this film wasn't to bad, and for a while there, I was kind of impressed with what I was seeing, considering the bad word of mouth reviews I had heard, and some of the problems that occured on the set. First off, the clues that they give as to who the actual killer identity is are broadcast loud and clear.  The story of how everybody gets to the hotel is kinda neat, and the little backgrounds that are given are sufficent, but my main complaint is that there are to many characters.  With too many characters, there is no real way to make any of these characters fully fleshed out and make us really care or hate them.  That combined with a weak cop out ending make this a film that you should see if you have nothing better to do.  Everything else is fine. On a side note, John Cusack tried to get out of the project 3/4 of the way into filming due to different people rewirting the ending.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
An unexpected thriller,"At first, you can't say that the film ""Identification"" will become something extraordinary in terms of the plot. You expect to see a thriller about a certain serial killer who ends up in a motel, like the rest of the participants in the events, but by the end of the picture you sit and think how interesting everything that you just saw is presented.""Identification"" has assembled an excellent cast. Every name is known, the acting is very decent. Ray Liotta, Amanda Peet, John Cusack, John Hawkes, Alfred Molina. Everyone is talented and chosen for the film is perfect. Each of them has his own role. Cusack is trying to figure everything out, Hawkes seems to be a little out of his mind, Liotta is too twitchy. The dialogues are spelled out perfectly. They literally immerse you in this atmosphere of eerie solitude, where there is no one around and only a silent killer nearby.The picture is complemented by a typical night shower, which cuts off the entire team from the outside world and forces them to try to cope with the situation on their own.The plot is quite complicated, has a number of so-called flashbacks, which are designed to shed light on the events and help viewers understand how what happened happened. Finally, when you look at the clock (yes, yes, I looked, realizing that it was time to show us the killer), then suddenly the dead disappear, and there are a lot of questions again. And then comes the realization that you are not watching a typical thriller, the authors went much further, forcing the audience to imagine what kind of mysticism is possible.Few films can boast of twists. And even less successful twists. But the ""Identification"" made me sit through all the credits with my mouth open and questions in my head: ""Well, how is this so?"" In my opinion, this is an excellent proof that the movie succeeded.James Mangold put on an excellent picture, which managed to successfully change the genre right during the narration, left some understatement, was remembered for positive emotions. ""Identification"" is an excellent detective and thriller with a good portion of mystical moments. The film pleases the viewer, not allowing to distract from what is happening on the screen creepy narrative.8 out of 10.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Killin' em wetly - but great ending!,"On the surface, Identity seems like a cheap knockoff of an Agatha Christie paperback. You know the type. Several disparate types are stranded on an island or in an old mansion or a broken-down hotel, and it's raining cats and dogs outside, and wouldn't you know it, but they're being picked off, one by one. But beyond the obvious setup, this isn't anything like And Then There Were Young or its myriad imitations. This has a few twists, including an outstanding one right near the end.Several people wind up at a ramshackle motel in the middle of nowhere. It's pouring rain. The road's been flooded both ways, so no one can get out. Among the stranded are a limo driver (John Cusack) and his employer-actress (Rebecca DeMornay), an irascible cop (Ray Liotta) and the convict he's chaperoning (Jake Busey), a prostitute (Amanda Peet), a newlywed couple, and a man (John C. McGinley) and his family, complete with a mute son.Pretty disparate, all right. But trouble's afoot from the get-go, as Cusack, blinded by the torrential rain, runs over McGinley's wife, causing severe injuries. As the woman slips in and out of consciousness, Cusack must rush to the hospital to get an ambulance (phone's out, of course, and she can't be moved). But then it's flooded, see, and... well, everyone winds up back at the motel.Sometimes thrillers explain themselves a bit too well - and too often - and the viewer has too much of an idea what's coming. Telegraphing what's to happen to a character is one of the biggest flaws of most thrillers, and if the viewer stops and thinks about the movie, the movie's sunk. Once thought enters the viewers mind, the holes in the plot are as familiar as Swiss cheese.But the plot in Identity holds up very well, thanks in no small part to a great cast. Normally, in ensemble pieces like this the cast is comprised of once-great or once-pretty-good actors, people you've heard of but not lately. But Identity's cast is peppered with names familiar for their recent talents, and not their tabloid prowess. For instance, what's Cusack doing here? Isn't he slumming? Yes..... and no. It's a murder thriller, but he elevates the movie far beyond its rudimentary whodunit origins.Cusack's great - I've yet to see him be awful - but he's not the only one with a bravura performance. Liotta's turn as the cop is gritty (he's no stranger to the role, playing a similar one in Unlawful Entry) and ultimately believable, and McGinley's a lot better than the underwritten role he was handed. Also shining is Peet as the hooker - I've never really liked her, but she did a good job with a good role.And the atmosphere is wonderful! It felt like it was raining in my apartment. I jumped when they jumped, and I cringed when they cringed. That's good camerawork.The good aspects are the ending, the ending, the acting, the ending, and the atmosphere; the bad aspect is the middle stuff, as a lot of the movie is slasherific.But the ending is excellent, in case I forgot to mention it. The only thing I will tell you is that the standard ""everyone dies"" mantra begun by some guy named Shakespeare or something doesn't hold true here.My score: ***",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Cool Twist on a Familiar Thriller Theme,"IDENTITY takes a concept that we've seen countless times before and puts an interesting new spin on it. It's got its problems, but sports a mostly solid cast and a cool enough twist to make it stand out as a fun thriller. It starts as your usual ""Ten Little Indians"" style thriller, with a group of seemingly random people brought together in an isolated location before they begin dying off one by one under mysterious circumstances, but IDENTITY has a unique twist (that I will try to avoid ruining here in case you haven't seen the movie). The events are set in a desolate Nevada motel in the middle of the desert where a rainstorm has stranded 10 strangers for the night: Ed (Cusack) is a limousine driver transporting a washed up actress with an attitude, Paris (Peet) is a prostitute on her way to Florida in an effort to start a new life, Rhodes (Liotta) is a police officer moving a serial murderer between prisons, Ginny (Duvall) and Lou (Scott) are miserable newlyweds, and the York family is searching for help when the mother is run down by Ed's limo in a horrific accident. The storm has flooded all roads out of the area and soon visitors are killed in bizarre ways and paranoia settles in when they realize the killer could be any one of them. Meanwhile, in a seemingly unrelated story, a man convicted of multiple homicides is given one last opportunity to plead his case with a judge in hopes of staving off a death sentence.It's tough to mention any parts of the film that either worked or failed without wandering into spoiler territory so I'll try to keep it vague story-wise. For the most part, it's a cool movie. I love movies set in a single isolated location (in this case the motel) because the location becomes it's own character. Here is a creepy, worn-out motel with it's buzzing neon sign in the middle of an empty highway, run by a scrawny, strung-out out man who has his own secrets. The rain is a constant presence, adding to the horror movie vibe. Without the ability to jump between locations, a movie like this is forced to turn to its characters for the story, so the movie really rides of the cast and their performances to carry its weight. Director James Mangold and cinematographer Phedon Papamicheal do an awesome job of giving the movie it's foreboding atmosphere and the cast make an otherwise ""been there, done that"" story feel fresh. John Cusack is an awesome character actor and you can pretty much count on him to keep it interesting, and Ray Liotta has pretty much made a career out of playing cops/criminals so his turn here as the short-tempered Rhodes isn't a stretch for him. There are a few other good performances out of the supporting crew (mostly Amanda Peet and John Hawkes, as the shifty motel owner), but the rest border on annoying and over-the-top. Then again, John C. McGinley is almost always over-the-top, so I guess he can be forgiven here.The main draw of IDENTITY is, of course, the big reveal at the end of the second act that ties everything together and explains the logic behind it all. In theory, it was a cool twist and it adds a lot to the movie. It's something we hadn't seen done before and I can appreciate any movie that gets creative with old ideas. The problem was in the execution. I can forgive any other aggravation or annoyances with the movie, but the final reveal is just too laughable. So, in a way, the movie is really cool up until the final five minutes. The end just spoils it. Anyone who has seen it would probably agree. I can almost see why it was written that way, and it sort of makes sense. But that doesn't make it any less amusing and, since this isn't meant to be a comedy, sort of ruins the vibe. IDENTITY is a cool movie despite its flaws. I hate to say it's forgettable but it's just one of those movies that sank into the background soon after its release. I'd forgotten about it until I saw it sitting on my shelf collecting dust and gave it another viewing to see if it held up. And it does, pretty well. It won't wow anyone and it might make you chuckle at the end, but IDENTITY is pretty good overall.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

You have a hooker, an hotel clerk, an actress, an limo driver, an married couple with a young boy, a young married couple, and an police officer who is trying to relocate an prisoner. They soon realize that they are being killed off one by one. But then this movie makes a turn and you begin to think it could be something else which makes the film even more creepy and intense.

Very good,"I like movies that play with your mind, but in the end you see that everything fits in place. Some good examples are Memento, The Usual Suspects, or Fight Club.I picked up Identity mostly because it looked interesting and stars John Cusack, whom I believe is grossly underrated in general. It turned out to be a heck of a 90 minute ride! I didn't see the plot twist coming, and I found everything to be very satisfying.You'll see parallels to Psycho and Ten Little Indians, but Identity is unique. A little too violent to be generally recommendable (I don't care for slasher flicks), too good to pass up. I'll give it a 7, and personally rate it an 8 for those who are less squeamish, yet enjoy an intelligent movie.

The story is intriguing, and fairly original as well. I was very impressed by the acting, especially Ray Liotta as the tough, obnoxious cop.My favorite part of this movie was the climax. Like most people, I had been told that there was a major plot twist, and had figured it out before it was revealed. Yet, there are actually TWO plot twists, and I never saw the second one coming!

Who am i here?,"It's hard to believe that ""Identity"" Sprung forth from the same pen as that of the author of that really bad killer snowman movie ""Jack Frost"" and it's unwanted sequel, but hey never mind, Because in ""Indentity"" Michael Cooney has created a true Mystery thriller.As i write these words, the rain outside is coming down in sheets, which gave me the notion to watch this movie again. Which i duly did. The coolest things about movies such as this, is the way they are constructed, much like ""Dead End"" you can theorise and guess your way through the whole, but how often do you ever get it right, i know i never have.Anyway, the perfect premise is set when we fade and it's a dark and stormy night, off into the distance lit up by neon light we see a desolate motel and thats when the fun begins. The introduction of the ten principle characters and how they came to be was truly something, some would call it the fate of the gods.The cast, headed by John Cusack, all aquitted themselves most admirably, especially Pruitt Taylor Vince, in the pivotal role of Malcolm Rivers, the man with the story, unfolding within his own mind.I had a sudden notion, by the time you arrive at the conclusion, once you have deliberated over the evidence presented, you are going to ask yourself one simple question, ""Who am I Here""? after you've viewed the film in it's entirety, your going to think you did it.Now that is a mystery fit for solving. I must also add that the extras on the DVD release are pretty smart, especially the writer's commentary, i didn't realize that Michael Cooney was English, nothing wrong with that, as his commentary, the evolution of a screenplay was one of the most involving commentaries i've ever had the pleasure of listening to.On a rating out of 10, on a dark and stormy night such as this, dare i say 10 out of 10, without hesitation.",,Anonymous,Mystery

Film noir so deliciously old-school it should have been filmed in black and white.,"Identity is a stylish and toney film noir so deliciously old-school it should have been filmed in black and white.  Some of the comments I have seen regarding this film indicate that most viewers didn't get it.  That's understandable since it wasn't rolled out like a red carpet or spoon fed like most other movies.This movie was infinitely more imaginative and entertaining than the vapid and dreary poser film ""Memento"" that so many here enjoyed for some reason that still escapes me.  It succeeds where Memento fails, and delivers substance and style where Memento relies on device and contrivance.John Cusack contributes immeasurably to this film, as he does to everything he does, but this is decidedly an ensemble piece. Despite comments elsewhere that indicate a lack of understanding of literary craft, the non-linear delivery is classic noir and takes full advantage of a genre that lesser films have tried to mine without out success.Take your copy of Memento to a used disc store and see if they'll buy it back.  Use the proceeds to buy Identity and your DVD collection will be vastly improved.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Decent, but less than the sum of its parts","Blessed with an intriguing hook, escalating suspense and a game ensemble cast, IDENTITY is ultimately more style than substance. This is not to say it is not diverting and largely entertaining. It's just also a bit of a cop out. Coming on the heels of no less than five recent movies featuring the same modus operandi of the cagey or otherwise unreliable narrator / narrative (MULHOLLAND DRIVE, THE USUAL SUSPECTS, FIGHT CLUB, THE MATRIX, SIXTH SENSE and even CUBE 2), IDENTITY is probably the least successful of the group in logically / cleverly integrating the gimmick. Coming so late in this plot device's cycle, one would have hoped for more than mostly nonsensical pseudo-psychological mumbo jumbo. Still, this is not to say that the movie isn't an enjoyable ride. It just doesn't go very far after promising a much greater journey.SPOILERSLike too many X-Files episodes, the movie sets up a clever challenge and hook which the climax and conclusion is never able to satisfyingly explain or resolve. A movie which owes a tremendous debt to PSYCHO, IDENTITY ultimately suffers the same anti-climactic letdown inflicted on us by Hitchcock. PSCYHO's five minute pop psychological soapbox soliloquy on cross dressing by Simon Oakland is matched by IDENTITY's similarly laughable lip service dissertation by the defense psychologist on how the entire movie we've been watching is the schizophrenic delusions of a sybillic patient. This longwinded and patronizing lecture on split personalities is almost as dated as Leslie Nielsen's ""Monsters of the Id"" deus ex machina from FORBIDDEN PLANET.Much like FIGHT CLUB, another movie which relies heavily on the POV of an insane (in this case schizophrenic) protagonist, IDENTITY begins to lose steam just as it strains hardest to impress us with its twists. The problem is not that the story isn't ambitious. The problem is that the split personality twist is from out in left field and we are left bushwhacked, sidetracked and disappointed. It's a twist that we don't want to be true because it ruins the mystery that we hope will have a much better explanation.Obviously the creators give a lot of thought to structuring the reveal and choreograph individuals' locations at the time of each murder such that any number of red herrings and solid suspects are available. At first Busey seems a great suspect. Then the motel manager. Then Ray Liotta. Then ghosts from the ""Indian Burial Ground."" There is much to admire in the first half hour, where we meet the ten characters efficiently and unpredictably. We see in nicely non-linear fashion how each player's actions contribute to the others' arrival at the remote motel where they will all ultimately die.IDENTITY has plenty of jolts and some smartness. While it outsmarts itself at the end and gives in to a gimmicky finale, up to that point it is a divertingly creepy and intriguing road to nowhere.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Not As Good As I Thought/Hoped It Would Be,I watched 'City By The Sea' Saturday Night for A$2.95 on DVD and 'Identity' the next day in a Cinema for A$13.00.  I had the assumption that the latter would easily be better value for money despite the price.  I was wrong. 'Identity' started off as a good movie but deteriorated 1/2 - 2/3 of the way through because of a much described twist that left me (and many other viewers I believe) not caring what happened to the characters.  I really had thought this movie would be better than it turned out to be.  My expectations I fear were too high.  6/10,6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Interesting Murder Mystery with a Twist,"This is film an interesting film for me. For whatever reason, I didn't see this until an ex, who had it on DVD, said we needed to watch it. She had a John Cusack fetish, so that was probably why. My second viewing is with my girlfriend Jaime, who loves this movie as well and it also was one I needed to revisit for The Podcast Under the Stairs' Summer Challenge Series for the 2000s. The synopsis here is stranded at a desolate Nevada motel during a nasty rain storm, ten strangers become acquainted with each other when they realize that they're being killed off one by one.We start by listening to tapes from an interview. We eventually see that it is Dr. Malick (Alfred Molina) that is listening to them. He is a psychiatrist from what I'm gathering. He is assigned to a patient that is due up for execution, but some information from the interviews and a journal reveals new evidence. The district attorney, Marshall Bell, is woke up and he's irate at his assistant DA, Matt Letscher, for letting this happen without him knowing. The prisoner is being transported to the secret hearing and he had no idea until now. It really isn't the assistant DA's fault though, this is all happening fast as the execution is tomorrow. So an emergency hearing is called.We then cut to the desert. There is a couple with a child traveling. The stepfather is George York (John C. McGinley). Along with him is his wife Alice (Leila Kenzle) and her son Timmy (Bret Loehr). George has an OCD-like issue and Alice or her son doesn't really talk much. They get a flat tire and they pull over to fix it, which he's surprised to see a high-heel shoe caused it. We then get to see it belongs to an escort of Paris (Amanda Peet).Also out here in the desert is Ed (Cusack). He's driving for an aging actress of Caroline Suzanne (Rebecca De Mornay). She isn't very nice. When her phone dies, she asks Ed to check the bag next to him for a battery. It is raining badly out so he isn't paying attention when he hits someone. It ends up being Alice. He is trying to find a hospital, but the path is blocked by water. Also all the phones they find don't work which is thanks to Paris. She backed her car into a pole trying to avoid a flooded road on the other side.These people converge on a motel that is run by Larry (John Hawkes). Also coming there is a newlywed couple of Ginny (Clea DuVall) and Lou (William Lee Scott). They're not getting off to a good start as they're doing a lot of fighting. Also coming to this place is a police officer named Rhodes (Ray Liotta). He's transporting a prisoner, Robert Maine (Jake Busey). Not everyone is who they seem though and when these people start to be murdered one by one, they have to get to the bottom of this before it is too late.Running concurrently is the meeting in the conference room. The judge who already heard the case is Taylor (Holmes Osborne). The prisoner's defense attorney is Carmen Argenziano and he thinks that along with what Dr. Malick has to say, they cannot execute his client. The question becomes, how are these two stories connected?I have to say that coming the first time I came into watching this film, I had just had a vague idea of what it was about and didn't know what was going on for most of it. When I say that, I mean it as a good thing since it was not predictable and it had me guessing until the end. There are a lot of details that I left out of the review, because it would begin to give away what happens in this film and I feel I cleaned it up even more with this update. This is definitely a movie that is good even with a second viewing. I will admit, I didn't remember how it played out, just the basic premise.How this is constructed is something that really works for me. With that first viewing, it is pretty much how I left my recap of trying to figure out how they're connected. We know that there's a criminal that is being escorted to the hearing so it seems to connect with what we're seeing. It goes beyond that though. Everyone we meet has something to hide. Ed used to be a cop and notices things that Rhodes is doing don't necessarily fit for someone in the profession. He could just be sloppy though. Paris has a bunch of money. Larry is nervous about people going to certain room. It is just things like this that as you learn more; you see how the pieces fit together.The setting is also really good as well. You have a motel, in the middle of the desert and it is a horrible rain storm. The movie gives you clues to the truth, even from the beginning. It is some what of an adaptation of Agatha Christie's 'Ten Little Indians' and plays like a neo-giallo film to be honest. I say this as we get red herrings and the characters are picked off until we get to the truth.This is aided by how strong of a cast we have here. I know many people don't really care for Cusack, but I think he's good in this movie. Liotta is solid as well and what really works for him is just his outburst. Peet is quite attractive. She also works well in this movie as I'd say she is the third lead. Hawkes, DuVall, Molina, McGinley, Scott, Busey, Pruitt Taylor Vince, De Mornay and the rest are just solid as well. There isn't a bad performance in this movie if I'm honest.Aside from that, it would really just be the effects to cover. We don't get to see much, but there are a couple scenes where people are hit by moving vehicles. I thought they looked good. We get to see the after effects of deaths that do as well. The rain also looks quite real if I'm honest which adds a lot to the claustrophobic feel since they can't get out. There is something I'll hint at here, there are some unbelievable things. Disbelief needs to be suspended a bit as we have nightmare logic. To finish this thought up, the cinematography was well done also.Now that's all I really wanted to go over with this movie. I think it is one that holds up after multiple viewings. It is an interesting neo-giallo/Ten Little Indians type film. Where this movie ends up though is great. I love the concept and the acting is strong to get us there where I don't really think we get a bad performance. The setting and the circumstances that keep them there is included here as well. No issues with the effects or how this was shot and the soundtrack fit for what was needed. I'd say this is really good movie and would recommend giving this a viewing to horror and non-horror fans alike for sure.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Good Layout, Poor Pay Off","Im not saying the film was horrible, or even bad, it was good, but I wouldn't say great. It is worth seeing, but don't expect to be blown away.The set up of the film was excellent. How everything tied together. IE: Everyone being trapped at a motel due to the actions of the prostitute, the Serial Killers mother being a prostitute who left him in a motel. The little details were leading up to something very interesting. The vibe of the film was excellent (until the twist). The constant down pour, the dirty motel, the coming together of the characters, the unravel of the mystery, the dwindling of the cast, all of these elements were great. The (not too inventive) twist however, just let me not caring. Upon realizing all the characters were just in somebody's head, I didn't care for the characters at all. Its hard to have 'sympathy' for the characters that are just in somebodys head (yes I am aware of how ridiculous that sounds while commenting on a work of fiction :). And the montage of the little boy at the end was neither freaky nor scary. The movie was interesting, and very well done (aside from the one or two minor criticisms), just don't expect to be awed.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Agatha Christie meets Norman Bates.,"This is a cleverly written movie about eleven people stranded at a rundown motel during a rainstorm who inexplicably start dying off one by one.

Excellent direction...,"Review of James Mangold's IdentitySeemingly influenced in equal amounts by Fincher, Hitchcock and Agatha Christie, James Mangold has produced an interesting and intriguing piece.Ten individuals with one thing in common find themselves stranded in a desert motel in the pouring rain. Cue the beginning of a string of gruesome murders, and the inevitability that all of the group will eventually become victims.Filmed on a set bearing an immense resemblance to that of Psycho, the story is that of murder-mystery crossed with horror, culminating in an interesting, Fincher-esque twist. The basic premise of the movie is exciting to me, and it is shot with beautiful precision, in deep greys and reds, that combine with exceptional cinematography to give an awesome visual impression. The cast sets some established actors (Cusack and Liotta) with others (Amanda Peet and John Hawkes) with less experience, in an interesting ensemble.Throughout the film, I was impressed with the shooting and general ambience created. The acting, whilst a tad patchy in places was convincing, and this aided the director in his attempts to inflict upon the audience suspense of Hitchcockian levels. The one let down in my opinion was the scripting. Michael Cooney has been responsible for some serious misjudgements of screen writing in the past. This is not one of them. Thematically, the movie is excellent, with, in my opinion (here differing to many critics) the last third delivering an admirable twist and interesting look at the psychology of criminals. But for me, the actual dialogue was less than impressive. Some of William Lee Scott's lines were delivered in pure accordance to the Tarantino style guide, which provided me with a smile, but most of the rest of the film was let down by interminably formulaic and unbelievable dialogue.Overall, it seems to me that Identity is a triumph of direction, and is an exciting step in Mangold's career. Roger Ebert wrote in his review that the viewer could work out who committed the murders in the before this is revealed. I feel that this rather confused view of the film is one that many viewers will disagree with; and I essentially believe that this film is worth watching for all fans of a wide range of genres: the thriller, horror, and pure whodunits (especially anyone who has read Christie's And Then There Were None). But this is by no stretch of the imagination a modern classic. The dialogue is lacking too much in intensity for it to be classed in the same bracket as Fincher's first two films (Se7en and Fight Club) or indeed with any of Hitchcock's genre defining efforts. But in terms of enjoyable cinema, and well-educated direction, this is definitely worth a watch.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery

My advice is to see it in ""theatrical"" first, although ""extended"" will be tempting. The film is enjoyable on several levels, and the ""extended"" version will be more fun during a second viewing, when you're examining plot points, performances, and production style. The ""extended"" version includes a scene that implicitly gives too much information, due to its placement.A terrific ""motel set"" was built for the picture, and is fantastically detailed.

Hitchcockian in the 1st degree,"My wife and I found this to be a very entertaining edge of your seat thriller. Lots of jumpy moments, and very little blood letting, which is a relief. We had it figured out pretty much 1/3 of the way through, but it still made for an entertaining evening in front of the fire. I think maybe the filmmakers gave us to much info. Our only problem was the timeline; we felt it was out of sync between the Rivers storyline and the motel. I don't want to give anything away, so I'll leave it at that.

Stand up and be identified,"If one were to scan the confines of films released in the 2000's decade, they might be surprised at the barrage of horror and thrillers that were either released to minimal viewing, or endured success in the theater never to be spoken about again. Identity falls into the second category, and sadly, I don't believe, enjoyed the acclaim it deserves. It is a crafty thriller, in a world where few exist. It succeeds in areas usually left untouched in other thrillers. And its third act doesn't leave off on a botched cliffhanger.It is a dark and stormy night in Nevada. We see a family of three drive along an empty road before getting a flat. The man (McGinley) and the woman (Kenzle) get out of the car to attend to it and it isn't long before a limousine driver (Cusack) taxiing a brash and brazen actress (Mornay) strikes the woman, knocking her out and leaving her bleeding uncontrollably. While this is happening, the couples' kid (Loehr) witnesses it all.The road is flooded both ways, so the gang winds up heading to a seamy motel, run by John Hawkes in a well nuanced performance. Throughout the night, numerous other people show up at the motel such as Ray Liotta, whose character is transporting a convict to another prison, a prostitute (Peet), and a newlywed couple (Duvall and Scott). They believe that their presence in the same motel on the same night is a coincidence, until more information is revealed.All of this seems to be fine, until people start disappearing one by one. Experienced moviegoers may discover who it is before most. I was expecting Identity to have a great first act, an intriguing second act, but a phoned-in, cliché-ridden third act. On the contrary; every act in Identity is taken care of and the writing throughout the film is polished ecstatically.The performances are not overacted, with probably the one of the hour coming from John Cusack; an actor who I've always been pleased with. He captures the role of the everyman extremely well, and always seems to play the character who is sophisticated and tries to keep everyone controlled and collective. I think between Identity and 1408, he always has had problems with motels.Identity is a crafty, and well-done thriller, motivated by lively performances, slick writing, and a final act that wraps everything together nicely. It goes on the shelf not side-by-side cheap, inferior thrillers, but next to films like Jeepers Creepers and Joy Ride. I like to call this shelf ""underrated and unsung.""

It doesn't stick the landing.,"'Identity (2003)' sort of gets worse the longer you think about it, in a way, thanks mainly to its silly ending that tries to get in one last, somewhat 'edgy' shock but ends up feeling cheap, pretty nonsensical and, frankly, downright goofy. It's not just the ending itself that causes this retrospective souring, for the movie's true nature - revealed towards its final third - almost delegitimises the overall experience. In and of itself, this twist is a perfectly fine - though, very early-2000s - way to wrap up the plot, tying together the piece's otherwise apparently disparate halves in a relatively natural and, even, fairly clever way. The issue comes when you realise that this reveal actually makes the mainline 'whodunnit' stuff ever-so-slightly superfluous, especially when paired with the true ending that throws everything into question from a writing point of view. When taken as a whole, with everything on the table, the picture doesn't feel as though it knows what it really is or, even, what it's trying to do, I suppose - aside from take the audience on a 'guessing game', horror-themed roller-coaster. In the end, that's perfectly fine. That's all it is, though: fine. It could have been a lot more, a thriller that keeps your brain whirring long after its credits have rolled. In the moment, the movie is entertaining enough and it keeps you suitably engaged. Its puzzle pieces all fit together nicely and it doesn't cheat, per se - until it reaches its final reveal, which relies on, essentially, hidden information and, thus, feels cheap. I will say that I figured out its most major twist far before the piece ostensibly wanted me to, but that's not so much an issue as a testament to the fact that the jigsaw is solvable and, therefore, satisfying (until the final reveal, that is). It's also a testament to the fact that it's all quite generic. Ultimately, it's meant to be experienced and then forgotten, lapped up by an audience that love a good twist whether or not it makes absolute narrative sense or adds to its overall cohesion. It's well-made, enjoyable and almost entirely forgettable. 6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Fantastic thriller, with mind-blowing twists.","John Cusack stars in this thriller about 10 people who become stranded at a motel in the middle of a storm. They begin to die one by one, and as the mystery unfolds, we are mislead to several conclusions, and although we may predict one twist, there are more which hit us like a freight trains. Nothing is what it seems. Bizarre occurrences are abundant, such as a scene where one character escapes the hotel but ends up in an exact mirror image of it. My jaw was on the floor, because the end was so completely unexpected. An absolute must-see. 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Hard to identify,"Identity starts off brilliantly. It has various flash-backs and flash-forwards to keep you all entertained and works almost as a puzzle. It's clever and engaging and lets us all get to know the wonderful array of characters who obviously end up stranded at a motel. From then on, Identity tries to pull in a slasher element that would work if it actually tried to be a horror film and not just a thriller with killings. I mean, if you look at James Mangold's previous works, ""3:10 to Yuma"", ""Walk the Line"" etc. He's not exactly in touch with the horror genre and that's almost what the film pretends to be.Nevertheless it's very entertaining, but could've been executed better. The cast is great and the writing intelligent. Identity thrives off its characters, all of them different and engaging. You have to have a reaction when one of them gets the chop! The trouble being that the chops aren't very well done. Most of the kills are off-camera and don't generate up a lot of tension. Howver, it's the twist which the film thrives off. It had mixed reactions in my house. I thought it was really clever (although I had accidentally read an element of it before I'd actually seen it) and although something similar is regularly done in today's films (especially the horror genre) it was also buried under other elements which gives the film a whole new edge to it. Some might call it silly and pointless, but I call it original and intelligent.Identity isn't much of a horror film, which is a shame because I'm sure if it was approached as a slasher I'm sure I'd be giving it a solid 8. It does generate thrills but not as many as you might imagine. Perhaps if it was done today, it would've had a better look and feel to it. But that's not to say it's a bad film, because its not. It's genuinely interesting, has fantastic character development and is also extremely atmospheric with its use of pathetic fallacy and claustrophobia. It's worth a see, but don't go expecting something as great as some people like to paint.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
i.d.,"Wow what a sleek, stylish thriller. This one is not to be missed, this is the kind of film that the great Alfred Hitchcock would be proud off. 10 characters one motel,, ie.. like the Bates Motel sort of... anyways, the roads are flooded, and people start dying one by one,, and of course you have no idea who is doing the killings or why, where's the motive? John Cusack shines in his role as a Limo Driver as Ed. Ray Liotta also gives a gritty performance worth of an Oscar i believe, Amanda Peet, what can you say, sexy as ever, and can act, the rest of the cast is pretty decent as well, especially TEd Mcginley. The movie is very different than most thriller who dunnit's it's got some horror mixed in, some great one liners, for comedical zing, I loved the shots of the rain in the movie,, it's sort of like one of the characters. overall there really ain't nothing wrong with this movie, cept it pushes the envelope for how many plot twists you can use in a particular film i think.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Story Rules,"Sometimes I get so tired of those ""stream of consciousness"" films. In a better mood, I would be good enough to sit and listen calmly, as a professional and well-paid psychiatrist, absorbing all the emotional downpour and self-inflicting scars. Not all the time, though. So I really appreciate someone coming up with a good and well thought out film plot like this one. It is a pure story that carries all the weight. Even all the well-known and high-calibered actors are embarrassingly placed secondary or lower in certain cases. After the film, people would not be talking among themselves about Cusack, Liotta, Peet, Hawkes, or Vince, but the story and how it captures them. They would think and think about how they are completely deceived and tricked, and almost forget about other angles of the film. Serial murders in an isolated motel out there? No atmosphere is more typical and predictable. Then, it is not at all typical and predictable when the main actor, the story itself that is, unfolds. I saw this film a few years back and got the point, but not the delicateness of its presentation. Now, after some years and some film maturity, I notice. A film student would do himself or herself a big favor to watch this film several times to get the story and the way it is told. Some films are supposed to take us somewhere unfamiliar and yet believable. We the human beings are sometimes in need of an emotional makeover or an escapade, at least for an hour or a little longer. Too few of films today play that important role. Filmmakers use the filmmaking a little too much as a therapy for themselves and not always for the viewers. ""Identity"" is not even close to become a horror classic or a cult film, but it does what film lovers do: tell a good story without blinking.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Every Aspect Works,"The Plot = Ten strangers get stranded at a motel in the middle of nowhere, start to get picked off one by one by a mysterious killer, but why and what is they're connection.""Identity"" came out at a time just when the second slasher boom was coming to end and just before the remake reboot era. Identity was one thriller that managed to surprise me greatly, as it turned out to be a brilliant psychological slasher with a powerful cast, obviously borrowed heavily from ""And Then There Were None"", well I say the plot, but other than that this movie well and truly stands on its own. It may not be gory which is what doesn't make this movie a straight up slasher, but it is violent and brutal keeping it more towards the horror aspect. Another factor is what I liked is that I well and truly wanted to know why these people were getting murdered and they're separate story lines also kept me interested and this movie is full of surprises and even adds a mind screwing twist that for any first time viewer will never figure out, making it well and truly amazing and original. I mean the twist was just genius and a well and truly talking point.There is nothing bad I can say about this movie, the whodunit element was also done well and even had me shocked and surprised, The use of room keys as corpse markers is a great lead up for suspense. It's always edge-of-your-seat drama as red herrings are picked off, and the collection of people start to learn things about each other that make them all connected in some way, all of which makes the directing by James Mangold slick from beginning to end, with an effective and cleaver set up.Off all the slasher movies I have seen, very few have gathered such a diverse and memorable cast as this. First we get former cop now limo driver John Cusack (Ed) giving a real intense performance as one the male leads, as the movie progresses he becomes more and more interesting and captivating. Ray Liotta (Rhodes) plays it cool as the cop but at the same time quite charming and creepy at the same time, he nailed the part and stealing the show in almost every scene, his chemistry with John Cusack was a real highlight. Amanda Peet (Paris) played the hooker and tart with a heart really well as the unlikely but obvious final girl. Clea Duvall proved competent in role as one half of the young married couple, although I did find her constant whining pretty annoying at times. Rebecca De Mornay gives a stand out performance as the faded actress and early victim, she should have been given more screen time. John C McGingley gave a credible and strong performance as the socially awkward family man George. Jake Busey played the psychotic prisoner and obvious red herring really well and John Hawkes played the motel manager Larry brilliantly and hits all the right notes.All in all ""Identity"" is an effective horror through and through with a brilliant and perfectly played cast, an awesome story line and effective who done it plot which will keep you guessing until the end and a mind boggling twist that will blow your mind completely out of the water.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery

The answer is: Someone who's too smart for mainstream cinema and too stupid for David Lynch,"The question is: What kind of person is going to love _Identity_?The LA Times review says that you would never just be able to guess the ending of this movie.  Well, five minutes in, I guessed it.  I'll be the first to admit that _Identity_ does have potential: a taut psychological thriller based on Christie's _Ten Little Indians_.  Sartre even makes a brief appearance, leading one to hope that this film could give us a meaty existential meditation on the meaning of identity as well a few good scares.Don't get your hopes up.  _Identity_ does all the work for you, requiring zero thought and even less of an attention span.  I actually found myself making the story more interesting as I watched.  The ending, which is supposed to be a plot twist (though I can't see how your average 12 year old couldn't see it coming a mile away, given the structure of the film) just falls flat and left me with an empty kind of ""Is that all?"" feeling.  I got the feeling that the writer thought he was being original.  Negative on that, sir: see _Lost Highway_, _Mullholland Drive_, and _Passion of Mind_ for better variations on the final twist.That said, most of the audience did not feel as I did about the film, instead chuckling with amazement as they crooed:""THAT person was the killer?  How wacky and original?""[insert sound of me slapping my forehead- HARD]With all of that in mind, the performances are all really good.  It's nice to see John Cusack getting work.  Ray Liotta does the same role he always does, so you can pretty much take it or leave it.  Alfred Molina once again changes himself completely and leave me wondering what his real accent actually is.The look and misé en scène of this film was fantastic.  Maybe next time we can have a story.So, the only way to really enjoy this film is to be too smart for your average Hollywood fare and too obtuse to see the point that the film is trying to make.

"Incredible, Except for the Ending!","I have seen few films that give you are real Sixth Sense type of shock in them. It's probably because few directors are capable of manufacturing them. Then again, maybe there aren't enough good scripts. Whatever the reason, James Mangold does an excellent job with ""Identity"". The cast alone is stellar! You have Ray Liotta, John Cusack, Amanda Peet (great in ""The Whole Nine Yards""), Alfred Molina (Spiderman 2), Clea Du Vall, Rebecca De Mornay (quite a surprise), and a few other familiar faces.All of these stars are cast into a motley bunch of characters that are held up in a local motel due to a rainstorm. The introductory scenes are cleverly tied together in a sequence of demonstrations of how one thing leads to another. The final destination for all of these encounters is the motel, which seems to resemble an island in the middle of nowhere. I can't tell you much more of this film without ruining it. I can say that a convict arrives in the custody of an officer. He escapes and one of the hotel guests ends up dead. Murder continues as another and yet another of the group is killed.The redeeming quality of this film and the main reason to watch it is in its portrayal of everything appearing as what it is, yet being something entirely different. The ending, what adding another shock, was too far-fetched for me. I felt the movie could have actually ended at an earlier point, but it would have changed the entire overall mood.

It takes genre cliches, turns them on their head, and delivers an utterly delightful movie that's both silly and thrilling. John Cusack and Ray Liotta deliver fantastic performances in this twisty story, staying serious and focused throughout. The tight pacing and ominous atmosphere throughout the film are the main attributes that stick out, culminating in a perfect 90-minute movie that doesn't need to be a second longer.In terms of cinematography and production design, Phedon Papamichael's inky and bleak visual style and Mark Friedberg's brooding production design create a creepy and oppressive atmosphere, with a motel that hasn't looked this creepy since Psycho. The film has a perfect feel that sucks the audience into a rainy and oppressive ride that is just as slick as it is fun. And James Mangold's direction ties everything together, filming an enclosed area with a sense of place and character.In short, you must see this movie as soon as possible. Sure, it's silly, stupid, and pretty unbelievable, but it's also fun, enjoyable, crazy, and truly incredible entertainment.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"Very well paced, but loses suspense a bit fast","This sort of film is quite difficult to accomplish because it needs to be seamless between the events and actions taking place, and the theory behind them. The film makers have to be extremely careful not to give away too much, too early in the film, and they also have to make sure the film doesn't come across as one big explanation of itself (à la Inception).The introduction is poignant and catches the viewer's attention quite immediately. That momentum rides into the whole bulk of the film but then it turns slightly flat. Eventually we realize that ""flat"" area is essential to the very point and understanding of the film, and that's when we get into the crux of the plot. The movie starts to explain itself, and that happens a little fast in the film which makes it, not so much predictable (because it's not) but rather switches off the intensity and genuine sense of mystery that had been maintained so far. It's almost like film and viewer partner up together to see the story progress logically. The ending is interesting and offers yet another twist to the story and avoids a disappointing final impression and it's making a genuine statement rather than just trying to be a dramatic ending with no meaning, as often in this sort of twisty tale.The film probably suffers from a bit of herky jerky laying out of the plot, which interrupts the suspense before sparking it again some more, and would've benefited perhaps from a different setup.The setting and casting are good, the acting is good (from all, but Cusack in particular) and visually the film is rather memorable.

All of James Mangolds movies are excellent.

"Good Movie, but the script needed editing","I went into this film without hearing any reviews as I do with all films. I find it more effective to rate them myself. Anyway, I saw the trailer and the cast looked promising since they'd been involved in other films I enjoyed (ie, High Fidelity, Office Space). I thought it'd be interesting to see these actors in a new setting.The movie started a little slow, but picked up significantly. It has the elements and potential for a really good film, but the script had a few plot holes and could have used a few more drafts before production began.The acting was quite good, the best performances coming from Pruitt Taylor Vince and Alfred Molina. Overall, I would say this is a good film worth seeing in the theater as long as you don't let anyone spoil it for you. My only criticism is that the script needed to be patched up a little more (a few characters technically can't exist) and that this concept is much better suited for a psych-thiller than a slasher flick.

"WOW!!!!, a real suspenseful thriller","Great movie with a plot that has plenty of twists and turns.  Who are the real people and who are not?  A multiple personality criminal has committed several murders and is to be executed, but at the last minute he is given a hearing for a possible reprieve.  Now many personalities start to show up at a desolate motel on a stormy night, but one by one they are being killed off. To what does one owe all this?  Are the killings real, or the figment of the psycho's imagination?  To that end,is the movie about events or the mind's eye of the psycho?  Great and suspenseful who done it with a lot of super actors.  John Cusack and John Liotta along with Amanda Peet will keep you spell bound. It was only near the end that the true nature of the movie plot can be discerned and for that you will have to watch it.  It will be worth your time.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery

However, the film tends to take on too many personas in the process, concluding in a explosion of different genres and styles. While the film did have some very interesting ideas, it tried cramming too many within the 90-minute run time. Maybe if they had stayed on one straight line, it would have garnered an 8/10 from me.

Some People Never Get a Second Chance,"Do NOT read any reviews before seeing this movie. NONE. Every professional critic is adamant about not giving the plot away, and yet all do, in some way or another.You are going to either love or hate this movie - there is no 'in between'. Yes, the clues are there from the beginning, as there must be in all movies of this genre, so you could possibly pick it up early on.Some of the acting is superb. John Hawkes is a stand-out with many; he gets some fantastic lines. You may have seen Pruitt Taylor Vince in Murder One, where he plays more or less the same kind of part.Direction can be magnificent at times. Timing and precise writing in other words. Don't be surprised if you feel the movie is playing tongue in cheek with the audience and the genre.Should you go see it? My question exactly. I went because the g/f wanted to see a movie - any movie - and because the pickings have been so exceptionally (and dismally) slim for so long. Is it better than the average fare out right now? Perhaps. Is it a good movie, a great movie, a movie which will go to history as one that either moved you or set a precedent? No, I think not.Again, once you find out what the BIG BAD SECRET is all about, you're going to either love the movie or hate it. That's not very encouraging - I know that. It is not Ten Little Indians; it is not The Usual Suspects; it is not a thriller, or a horror movie, and certainly not a mystery. It's a bit of all of these, and yet none at the same time.Kudos to the director for finding a way to get to the meat of the story early on so as to not waste time on character and plot development.

Leaves you dissatisfied and cheated,"When I first read about ""Identity"" on IMDB, and watched the trailer in theatre, I thought it might be a really good movie. The synopsis made me remember the 60's Bollywood movie ""Gumnaam"". ""Gumnaam"" had same plot of 10 people being stranded in Island, and getting killed one after another. It was a real good movie with some excellent music by Shankar JaikishanSo the synopsis of ""Identity"" felt more like a ""remake"" of ""Gumnaam"". I was thrilled by the thought of seeing a good suspense movie after a long time. And true, the first hour of movie is worth watching for the goosepimples and chills it gives time to time. However, when the curtain is lifted from the suspense, you feel very cheated and angry.I think Hollywood is churning a seris of psycho-supernatural thrillers . ""Sixth Sense"" started a trend. Then came ""Unbreakable"", ""The Others"", ""Vanilla Sky"", ""Minority Report"", ""Beautiful Mind"" - to name a few. ""Identity"" is a movie that tries to fit itself in this category, but fails miserably. I should have given 6.5/10 rating, but no decimals allowed.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

All of them along with a hooker, a couple of very young newlyweds and another cop and his prisoner get stranded in this motel as things go very very strange.

...whores don't get second chances...,"...i've watched this film multiple times over the years and it never gets boring, there is always something new that i have not noticed before. first off, i would like to say that James Mangold is one of the best directors around who probably no one has heard of. you don't have to give him a big budget for him to make a good movie. he did "" 3:10 to Yuma "" on something like 20 million dollars and most of the money went to the 2 huge leads ( Christian bale and Russell crowe ), and that movie looked like a 60 million dollar picture...which still isn't a big budget.this movie in my opinion has so many good things going for it and i would give it a little higher then an 8 except Amanda peete's acting was just a little bit weak compared to everybody else's. i personally am a big fan of her's though and she's gotten a lot better over the years, where i think she can carry a feature film by herself now.the night scenes...the constant rain( less then 1 minute of the film had no rain or thunder and lighting ). i love that type of atmosphere and you can look high and dry and go blind before you find another movie with all rain and at night...trust me, i tried.the photography was great, there was a lot of tension and suspense. there are plenty of twist and turns in this movie and one great one. great mystery slasher flick...you are not going to find many of this caliber, one of Mangold's best if not his best.all in all you can't go wrong with this movie as a movie fan as it is so well done. i believe that if you do watch this movie and enjoyed it you will watch this movie many more times over the coming years. for some reason this movie just stays on my mind over the years. a great gem that i think not many people know about and to me a timeless classic "" who done it ?

There's no place like home,"Strongly cast, tightly scripted, and well acted. This movie was well on its way to being a classic thriller. For the first hour. Then it all fell apart.Once the surprise twist is revealed the audience is left with two emotions. One, we've been had. Everything we saw up until the reveal was meaningless. It was like changing the channel to another movie. The movie just rebooted and we've seen two minutes of relevant footage.The second emotion is ugh. We've seen this twist before. Too many times for it to surprise or thrill. It is effective exactly once, and if you're over the age of five it's too late for you.Worse, the twist doesn't hold up on a second viewing. There are multiple characters doing things in different parts of the motel at the same time. The writers apparently are unaware that human beings can only manage one point of view at time. Try it. You can't focus on two scenes at the same time. You can switch your focus back and forth, but that isn't what we're shown on screen. Fail.Ten stars for the first hour. Minus six for the twist that fails. Zero for the second movie we are stuck watching at the end. It's boring. Four stars.",4.0,Anonymous,Mystery
First half=boring  Second half=great,"Now i must warn you that the first half of this film is an chore to get through. In fact i was thinking of turning the damn thing off but if you keep on watching , the film begins to pick up the pace and the plot becomes more diverse . This not the best thriller every but it contains its own original twist. The setting is perfect. An motel placed in the middle of nowhere. The director captures the atmosphere well with the constant raining and lightning adding more of an effect. Sure these two elements are always being used but there nothing wrong with that.The actors carry out there roles reasonable well. there no exceptional performance from anyone but you don't expect that from this type of film. Now for the twist, a lot of people struggle to understand it. Personally , it not all to complicated to follow. If you know about split personalities then the conclusion shouldn't be to hard to understand.Some negatives is that the ending is easily predictable. It doesn't keep you guessing but instead wondering if the whole plot ties together. Also there no artistic value to it. When you are told of what is really happening you will begin to wonder if the director could of added more depth to the world rather than basing it in another typical world .But still the film is enjoyable to watch and one which you'll be talking about after it finishes.

After a variety of apparently random people got stuck at a motel, one after another gets killed (rather graphical) and later the corpses disappear. Nobody knows who the psycho killer is and the incidents almost seem to be supernatural. That's when we get an insight into the killers mind...

"Could have been great, but is cliched all to hell and riddle with more holes than an Iraqi house.","I tried to watch this movie without any expectations, and it has two good actors in it, so I figured it might lead to something original. hmmm. It has an interesting enough concept, and midway through it really showed some promise after a certain something was revealed. However, anything in the film is soon tarnished by a laughably predictable Hollywood ending that most might not see coming because they won't think they'd even take it that far. I joked about how the movie would end while watching it, but was surprised I was right when it came. Should have known better. The plot twist itself, prior to the ending, could have made a decent movie and I'm sure the director thought he was making an intelligent film. But the way I see it, the twist makes it all too convenient for the plot holes and inconsistencies to exist without explanation anywhere in the story.Ray Liotta and John Cusack pull off some good performances, but no acting performance could make up for the story. For example, put Keanu Reeves in the Matrix and it still sucks. Wait, he's not an actor. Liotta should stick to crime drama and Cusack should stick with those quirky movies we all love to see him in.I can see why some people may be fooled into believing this is a good movie. A good movie is one that can be watched time and time again. ANY movie can keep you interested until the end, but that doesn't necessarily make it good. All you've got to do is confuse the audience all to hell so that there's no way they can tell what's going on until the end......but in this case, it kept me interested with many intentional distractions only to be let down. The movie lost several points just for the cop out ending alone.I am genuinely fascinated by this film's favorable rating. I'm feeling generous today. 5/10",5.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Thinker's Thriller!,"When you watch ""Identity"", you immediately think of Agatha Christie's ""Ten Little Indians"". While its similar in theme, Director James Mangold adds some interesting psychological twists.The story is essentially about ten strangers who are thrown together at a seedy motel on a rainy night somewhere in Nevada. First we meet the motel manager Larry (John Hawkes) who is contemplating a slow night as he gulps down another glass of whiskey. At various stages arrive, the York family, George (John C. McGinley), his wife Alice (Leila Kenzle) who has been involved in an accident, and their young son Timmy (Bret Loehr). They are followed by a limo driver Ed (John Cusack), his passenger an over the hill actress (Rebecca De Mornay) and a hooker Paris (Amanda Peet) whom they picked up on the road. Also taking refuge from the storm is a newly married couple Ginny (Clea DuVall) and Lou (William Lee Scott). Finally a police officer Rhodes (Ray Liotta) and his prisoner (Jake Busey) arrive.Suddenly, gruesome murders begin happening as the ten begin to turn up dead one by one, by one means or another. The comment element is that room keys in descending order from 10 to 1 are found on each of the victims. The murderer remains a mystery although you may have your own suspect(s).Running parallel to this story is one about a last minute hearing for a convicted mass murderer Malcolm Rivers (Pruitt Taylor Vince) in a chilling performance, who is to be executed the next day. His psychiatrist Dr. Malick (Alfred Molina) is trying to convince a judge (Holmes Osborne) that his patient was not responsible for the crimes that he was accused of due to newly discovered evidence. What this has to do with the main story becomes clearer as the movie progresses.The acting in this movie is top notch from top to bottom and the direction is excellent. I'll give you a little advice though. Pay attention to the opening credit sequence. It will help explain things once you have seen the ending.The DVD release has an alternate ending with an additional scene but it adds little to an already exciting thriller.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
It ain't in the story. It's in the telling.,"Pouring rain, the dead of night, thunder and lightening, a deserted motel, a cop and his prisoner, a limo driver and an actress, a hooker, a sleazy motel operator, a family of three, a just married couple, etc. Such are the ingredients of this drama horror mystery suspense thriller flick which, as the body count mushrooms, begs the questions who's the killer? Though the plot is unoriginal, ""Identity"" offers good star power, state-of-the-art technicals, and sufficient intrigue in its circuitous and convulsive denouement to whet the interest of anyone in the mood for a smart blood and guts thriller. As the film plays out, however, some will find the excesses numbing, others will bemoan the absence of the conventional hero vs villain storyline, and still others will be fully engrossed for the duration.

A top notch psycho-thriller,"This is a film in which two seemingly unrelated stories run parallel. In one, we see an eleventh hour hearing where a psychiatrist tries to convince a judge to rescind a death penalty prior to the execution of a murderer. In the other, there are 11 people stranded in a highway motel in a stormy night and each one gets killed one after another in a mysterious and gory way. Considering the second story belongs to a very formulaic thriller which has been staged time and again, it would be naive to think that it makes up the core of the plot as the movie meanders along. There are enough number of twists and turns that will make your head spin. However, at the end you come to realize those twists are the essential elements of the plot and are not overly used as some viewers complain. There's also a very fine line between the annoying ""everything was a dream"" trick and psychoanalysis inside the murderer's mind. This causes polarized intelligent reviews that sway between love and hate. If you can see past ""the dream"" ploy you'll appreciate Identity as a well scripted, well directed and well acted movie which deserves the generally high marks it earns from the reviewers' ratings.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A solid cast makes it work.,"John Cusack leads a strong cast in ""Identity,"" a slasher film that has enough twists and turns to satisfy mystery fans, and enough blood and brutal killings for those who enjoy a good old fashioned stalk and slash fest. A group of strangers are forced to take shelter during a thunderstorm in a rundown motel that would give Norman Bates pause. Soon another guest shows up with a variety of sharp objects and a bad disposition. While portions of the film are a bit predictable, there is at least one or two surprises for those who think that they have seen it all. The murder sequences are generally offscreen, but the aftermath is often shown in surprisingly bloody detail....often playing very much like throwbacks to the early ""Friday the 13th"" films. But this cast is hardly your typical teen stalk and slash crew. Cusack is great as usual, in a role that is a big change of pace for him, with some good supporting work from a cast of recognizable faces, all of whom seem right at home in the tense atmosphere. Overall this is a fun horror film that is miles ahead of its current theatrical competition, ""House of 1000 Corpses"" in thrills, gore, talent, and originality.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

I don't know how the doctor treated him, he surprisingly makes the 10 identities together and makes them kill each other until one left.I think Rivers loves acting too much so that he puts himself into his role play too deep, I'm sure he can win an award maybe in Hollywood, but for the best director, impossible as the story is too weak, even weaker than the American scary stories.Fine get go, a quick conclusion: just so so.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Complex psychological thriller...,"1st watched 3/20/2004  - 7 out of 10(Dir- James Mangold): Complex psychological thriller that ends up being a story-within-a-story. I don't want to give away too much so all I'm going to say is that this is a well-done scary movie that starts out as a drama about a bunch of people and how they end up stopping at the same motel and then 1-by-1 those that are present start dying.  Eventually we find out that they all have something in common(I'll leave that for the viewer).  The director does a good job of re-directing our focus so that we have no idea what's going on until the final surprise half-hour.  Known for his cop movies, this is a departure for him but he does an excellent job with the material.  The acting is credible enough but it's the story that's really the star in this movie.  It's similar to a TEN LITTLE INDIANS type of plot but it doesn't go the same direction.  All-in-all this is scary well-done escapism with a twisted ending.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Cheesy Fun Entertainment With a Surprise Ending,"It started out cheesy but fun, so I kept watching the film. The movie continued it's cheesiness but became so fun and engrossing that I watched the entire film with laughs here and there. Then the ""big reveal"" came - we found out the answer to what was really going on - I was shocked and no longer laughed. This part of the film was very serious and made complete sense as to what I was witnessing the entire film. Good movie!Yes this film is cheesy, funny, interesting and entertaining - the climax will shock first time viewers. It's a good whodunit and why film. Recommended!!8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
I got mixed emotions about this....,Yes this is a good movie. The very end is little flawed (lame even). But the rest of the movie had me guessing (wrong too). I like any movie where I think I got figured out and I'm wrong. Multiple story lines continue and how they tie together make this a fun idea (if not a new bend on old ideas). I paid $1 on a Tuesday at a cheap theater and got my money's worth. Good rental. If your into creeping yourself out it's pretty good for that too. It can kind of get under your skin. 7/10,7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Thought provoking...but all for naught.,"Don't read this if you havent seen the movie yet. I thought that the murder mystery plot line was awesome.I hated the ""reality"" plot line. It should have just been a movie about the ten people in the motel.  The whole personality thing was trite and made all of the characters fictional, therefore i didn't care about them. Also, did ANYONE every believe that Ray Liotta was a cop and not a bad guy from the second you saw him?",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Twisted Away From Cheese,Thought this film was cheesy and unrealistic...but the twists were brilliant and put it up there with one of the best psychological thrillers I've seen.

Mixed emotions about a mixed up movie.,"I have mixed emotions about this movie. It has it's good parts, then it has it's bad parts. It had some okay acting, but John Cusack is so bland as usual in any of his movies. At first the movie seems like it's just a typical thriller and a whodunnit slasher flick. Well, I won't give anything else away, but think again. If you want to see a movie that has a crappy payoff, but like an okay thriller, then this may be for you. Too many twists and turns for no reason other than to say this movie is different. I can't say I recommend this movie. * 1/2 stars out of 4 * stars.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Mind blowing ending!,"A masterpiece of a movie. I would love to rewatch this movie. Amazing plot. I would give it more than 10 stars if there was an option. Must watch without a doubt. The flow of the story is unique, the plot itself is unique, the acters are marvelous. The runtime of the movie was good for the content. An absolute masterpiece of a script. The movie made you guess the killer but what do you know only some were able to guess. I would definitely add this movie to my movie collection. I myself am a fan of horror movies but this one hit my radar mainly because of Ray Liotta , the legendary actor. Also to be noted is that I was mind blown by the ending to the point that I had goosebumps at the credits of the movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Very intelligent up until the ending,"It's not the easiest thing, to write a review of a psychological thriller without giving away too many important points in the movie. But I'll try to give you an overall idea of what to look for and what's worth your attention in this film.The main thing I appreciated about this film was the unique way of being able to tell a story. This isn't a solid beginning to end film, it's a bit jumbled up, which adds to the movies excitement (Especially the accident scene) and really keeps your head going at full throttle to understand what you're seeing. It's impossible to not have your head going throughout the movie. With that said, the story and way the director decided to shoot it really helps the film out, and separates it from your usual `Who done it?' façade that most movies in this genre exploit.Moving on, great cast! John Cusak and Ray Liotta were perfect for their roles. I don't know how happy I was with Amanda Pete, but overall she worked out. The other characters however, fit into a cliché, which was unfortunate. The little boy, the feuding couple, the eccentric husband, even the prisoner Liotta's character is transporting looks like your average comic book creep, which is really a shame considering the sets used in the film were so nice, and there was no need to have these formulaic characters in them. It took away from how creepy the film could have been, and more importantly, ruined the tone during many a scene.Now what most people are interested in, the plot. The plot is the hardest thing to write about. I'll say this much: This movie has one of the most interesting, original plot twists that I have ever scene. People who have seen `The Usual Suspects' (and who hasn't) will appreciate the way this movie plays itself out. I can't imagine anyone being able to figure out why the events at the motel are happening, and form the correct conclusion on their own. Quite the unique piece of cinematic story telling.The biggest problem this movie has is not knowing when to stop, specifically the last five minutes of the movie. After digesting what was just dictated to you by the characters in the film, you sit back and think, `wow, that was really something. I was never expecting things to turn out that way.' However, once the ending is laid into place and you recline in the theater seat thinking how smart the movie was, you're treated to a double ending. What you think was true, is not and the true `killer' shows their face. In what has to be the worst idea in psychological thriller history, someone decided to make a certain character responsible for the acts committed that night with the motel murders. What a mistake! What an awful mistake! There was no need for it, it was unnecessary and completely out of place.Overall, the movie is smart, but plagued by one of the worst ending in recent history. Even psychological thrillers that I hated, such as `Angel Heart', had better endings than this! Great cast, great sets, great story, but in order to maintain that feeling, you have to walk out before the last two minutes of the film get revealed. Overall, 7 out of 10.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

It's so well done, the actors have done such a wonderful job of their characters. i like movies where characters make decisions that seem realistic, and this definitely flows in really well.

I like every bit of the movie and I would 100% recommend it to anyone who likes mystery, or thriller, or horror. A strong 10/10 because this has to be one of my favourite movies of all time.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Plot had great potential. Movie? Not so much ...,"This film has great plot potential, but it never gets out of the ""scare 'em"" mode, and just lays flat.This is great for a one off view, but not more. It's just too simplistic and relies on too many cliches. It's more
of a teenage scare 'em flick than a well-developed story.Here's my breakdown:STORY:
Some stories and their film versions can be watched repeatedly, and for good reason: they not only have
a great nuanced story but the characters are equally developed. Add good direction and the story becomes
a movie you enjoy watching more than once.But here, the characters have near zero depth, literally. They're just props. Some would argue that being props
is just the point, so why complain. My complaint is that the story is trying to weave complexity without you seeing
it done (yeah, like a magic show). The problem is it wreaks of teenage ""boo"" movies. The magic tricks fizzle ...It's a shame because this had good acting and a great plot. But the story's execution was cheap and flat.ACTING:
I thought everyone pulled their weight, however ... there really wasn't a lot of weight to pull here in the raining, dark night.ENTERTAINMENT:
First time mid -> high. Subsequent viewings: low.If you're looking for a creepy, mysterious, scary film that has a great story with solid acting then watch ""The Ring"" (2002).After multiple viewings ... it's still creepy.TEMPO:
The pace was actually well done, but the film just plops us down and expects us to ""work it out."" So I constantly was
wanting for context while being pushed through a ""house of mirrors."" Again, feels more like an amusement park ride
than a good film.CINEMATOGRAPHY:
RainDIRECTING / WRITING:
Director: Mangold directs drivel, which is why this felt ""cheap."" He shot ""3:10 to Yuma"" (2007), but that newer version
was poor compared to the original ""3:10 to Yuma"" (1957) with Ford and Heflin.Writers: Cooney hasn't written anything else I've seen or have interest in.Is it a good film? Yes, but just enough.Should you watch this once? Only.Rating: 7.3.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Worth Watching,"It is a dark and stormy night. A series of incidents brings a group of strangers together in a remote, dilapidated motor inn. Already, a feeling of doom encompasses the soggy sojourners, but then things get really weird.""Identity"" is a rather formulaic murder mystery with a compelling tone that is aided by moody incidental music and strong camera work. The story plays on the viewer's expectations, but takes things to another level when the facts don't seem to add up. Thus, another level of mystery is added, and its basic ""And Then There Were None"" outline becomes much more complicated.An interesting cast, highlighted by John Cusack--- as Ed, a limo driver diverted from transporting an actress because of a flooded road and an unfortunate accident---does a fine job. Director James Mangold delivers an economical story that moves briskly, keeping the audience in a constant state of surprise.Some may find the ending a letdown, but this is one of those films that will have you reconstructing everything in your head afterwards.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Good, but another big ""surprise""","Identity is the latest in a long line of recent thrillers that seems to live for ""the twist.""  Popularized recently mostly by films written and directed by M. Night Shyamalan, ""the twist"" is a feature of a film that develops in one direction to suddenly end up in another.  Much to my surprise, Identity handles it's primary twist well, and I commend it for that.  However, on the way to it's main twist, it tries to hard to build in others that are quickly revealed, much to my chagrin.The film is set primarily at a lonely motel in the middle of the desert.  A group of strangers, from various walks of life, find themselves stranded at this motel in the midst of a torrential rain storm.  One by one, they begin to die off in various rather gruesome ways, leaving the survivors to be suspicious of each other as to who is the killer.  The characters are all different, and as such utilizes the seeming requirement that a film with this kind of situation (small group of characters trapped in a secluded location) feature unique, and sometimes slightly weird, ""types"" to fill out it's roster.  The primary character is Ed, played by John Cusack, a limo driver transporting a fallen movie star (Rebecca DeMornay) to a job, and he quickly finds himself in his element as a former policeman while trying to solve the murders. The rest of the bunch is composed of Rhodes (Ray Liotta), a detective transporting Robert Maine (Jake Busey), a convicted killer; Paris (Amanda Peet) a prostitute on the way to a better life; newlyweds Ginny (Clea Duvall) and Lou (William Lee Scott); Larry (John Hawkes) the motel manager, and finally George (John C. McGinley) a rather mawkish man who's wife was injured in a traffic accident.  Even though they are ""types"" most of the actors do a good job of filling out their characters.Identity is a stylish looking film, full of wet, dark imagery that increases the creep factor extensively.  The film is also suspenseful throughout, featuring plenty of genuine scares and surprises for the most part. However, as the film continues to run, it becomes obvious that we, the audience, are being set up for a switch in the film's basic premise, which I will not reveal here.  However, it is not too surprising when this switch happens, as various earlier scenes telegraph it to us.  Director James Mangold and screenwriter Michael Cooney have slightly sabotaged one of the film's central conceits by constantly reminding us of what appears at first to be a subplot and eventually turns out to be the movie's primary plot.  I think that this twist would have worked better had there been almost no setup, or at least a lot less than was featured.That being said, Cooney and Mangold aren't through with us after that first twist.  There are others to come, and the final one is quite a surprise that was not nearly as obvious.  From that point of view, Identity is a success, proving that a filmmaker can still surprise the audience in a time when thrillers abound with twist endings becoming more and more unsurprising in their revelations.  You occasionally find yourself wishing that directors and writers would just make a straightforward thriller and leave the twists and turns in the past occasionally instead of always trying to formulate the next big ""surprise.""",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Great,"There won't be a more original movie for a long time.

You won't see it coming...,"Identity is a very well done American psycho thriller that convinces with a very solid acting, a couple of interesting characters and a very dark atmosphere as the whole movie plays during a dark and rainy night.The locations and the general story offer nothing new and play with some stereotypes but have a certain cheesy charm.The movie will though grip you after a few moments and not let you go until the end as it has a very fluid pace. The film is full of surprising events and many red herrings that keep you guessing until the end who is the one behind the brutal murders among ten very diversified persons that have randomly met in a cheap motel as it seems.The very twisted ending will divide the viewers into two groups. Those who like original psycho thrillers with weird conclusions that request some reflections and are not that easy to understand will definitely like the final which is rather hard to predict. In fact, the ending leads to two conclusions and one of it was very easy to predict for a genre connoisseur as I am but the second and more important part is quite impossible to find out.Those who like more traditional crime movies with police investigations and many clues that finally lead to the murderer in the end might find the ending too complicated, too difficult to understand and overall too weird.Personally, I liked the ending as it left me one some reflections and thoughts. It's simply different from what you're used to and I like this experimental courage of the script writers. This doesn't mean that the ending is complete nonsense or as surreal as David Lynch movie, it's still all rather logic to explain.If you are a fan of dark psycho thrillers and the famous ""Ten Little Indians"" concept and if you're not afraid of movies where you need to do some additional intellectual efforts to understand everything, you will definitely adore this flick that has no truly visible weak points apart of it short length and a couple of stereotypes that are introduced in the beginning.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

If you're having any hesitations about continuing the movie mid-way through, I highly recommend sticking it out. Director James Mangold does an excellent job connecting what seems to be two separate story lines at the end of the movie.

Entertaining modern slasher,"""Identity"" is a much better mystery/slasher than expected.**SPOILERS**During a torrential rainstorm, Ed Dakota, (John Cusack) manages to bring George York, (John C. McGinley) and his son Timmy, (Bret Loehr) to Larry's, (John Hawkes) motel in the middle of nowhere to help them seek shelter after a hit-and-run accident. Realizing that Paris, (Amanda Peet) Rhodes, (Ray Liotta) Ginny, (Clea DuVall) Lou, (William Lee Scott) and Caroline Suzanne, (Rebecca De Mornay) are all trapped at the motel as well because of the storm, all the normal ways of escape prove futile and decide to ride out the storm. Suddenly realizing that they're being killed off one-by-one in a series of gruesome murders, they suspect everyone has a motive for the killings, and as their numbers dwindle, they race to solve the killings and get away from the hotel alive.The Good News: This was a lot better than expected, and delivered a lot of good parts. One of the better parts is the fact that this one has a really great atmosphere that makes it really feel really great. The torrential rainstorm going on the background is mostly responsible for this, and the way it works is rather intriguing. By having the characters constantly going into and out of it and appearing completely drenched in the rain, and combined with the way that the mystery plays out is perfect at keeping the suspense up. The setting of the film, where they're at in the motel and the way it's lined out, it allows for a bunch of suspense and tension, and with the way the film allows the killer to be revealed, manage to make the film feel really tense and suspenseful. The way that it does work around the mystery of the killer angle is perhaps the best part of the whole film, as it's what makes the whole thing come together. By enabling every single one of them the opportunity to be tagged as the killer, it puts all of the film's focus into the clever tricks to do this. The gag about the names, birth-dates and the room-key version is all done rather nicely and all of these are apart of what helps the film along with it's impressive way of bringing along the suspense in the film. There's also the way it reveals the killer, which is one of the single most shocking ones in the genre, being one that's never expected nor feeling like it's there merely for the sake of a twist. It's nicely shocking and actually works, using the montage to great effect and coming up with some nice scenes. The last thing here is that the kills aren't so bad, and actually work nicely within the film, being unique enough that they're an overall nice collection which is really good to see. There's a baseball bat rammed down the throat, a couple are run over by cars, one of whom is rammed into a wall, there's a vicious stabbing in the stomach, a nice decapitation and a multitude of gunshots, among others in here. It's a healthy enough collection to make a really nice selection of kills here. All of these here are the film's good points.The Bad News: There wasn't too much really wrong with this one. The main flaw to this is the way that the film seems to plod along with it's pacing. Although it never once feels dull or boring, there's no real surge of adrenaline running through the scenes in here to really make it exciting or over-the-top, and while this keeps moving along nicely, none of these are really all that engaging and that means things just happen here, not the proper kind of reaction needed for a film like this. The other flaw to this one is the fact that most of the film's kills are off-screen, meaning that the kills are all reduced to mere splashes or aftermath, and the ones that are shown on-screen aren't all that graphic, making the aftermath the one part here that gets the blood over. These here are all the film's flaws.The Final Verdict: There was a lot better stuff in here than expected, making this one enjoyable and highly recommended. Look into this one if you're a fan of the genre, love your slashers with mystery or fans of the creative side, while those who aren't that into any of those should heed caution with it.Rated R: Graphic Violence and Graphic Language",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Amazing!,"So I just saw ""Identity"" and it was pretty fantastic!I found this film in a list called ""Movies with great twists"" and although I was a bit skeptical about it at first, I have to say it ended up being one of the best films I've seen in the last years.I've gotta say I started watching the film having seen an spoiler on one of the reviews here, so if you're reading this you should go watch the movie because it looks like people like to spoil this film a lot.Talking about the film, it is the definition of what the ""Mistery"" genre should be. If you decide to watch it you are gonna be the entire 90 minutes of it at the edge of your seat, because the movie creates an atmosphere of mystery that keeps you expectant to see what is next. It is full of twists and full of surprises, and makes you become a particular Sherlock trying to find who the bad guy is.All in all, ""Identity"" is a dark, well-written movie that anyone out there should enjoy.

Obvious (Thanks to the Marketing Dept.),"This is the first film I've seen where I've guessed the plot twist BEFORE seeing the movie!!

My suspicions where as good as confirmed during the opening titles, with more 'subtle' hints along the way. That's not to say that this is a bad film. A fantastic cast helps this film along with John Cusack being as watchable as ever, and Amanda Peet making a particularly good job of things.

Smart Flick,"I feel that this movie was excellent.  It is becoming harder and harder to appeal to mainstream audiences.  The movie was a smart flick and did not dumb itself down for the benefit of mindless slasher movie fans.  For many of these people, this fact is the movie's greatest flaw. That is why some can say Identity was excellent only for the first 80 minutes.  It is my belief that it is what comes after that 80 minute mark that makes this movie stand out from the typical Hollywood horror genre.

The fact that there are so many characters sort of dilutes the impact of any one of them and I like that. Why do we always have to have a lead star going up for the awards?

This is the only review you should read.,"Identity?  Who is who or what(?!), not so much who is the killer.  I will not give away any of this film or run pointlessly through every scene like other people who review movies on this site will do so read on...You can say this movie is over-cliched with horror elements like other reviewers have stated, but it is quite intentional and that is the best part of this film.  It's typical slasher setups and scenes are well designed for scares and/or suspense and you will find yourself engrossed in the first half of this film.  The direction and well crafted scenes are good enough here to blend suspense and confusion into good entertainment.To all those who claim this movie is only for ""intelligent"" viewers please don't write another review ever again. Scenes in the first half of this film may be standard to modern horror but because of the acting talent of most of it's stars, it comes off far better than many films of this genre.  But when it comes time to blend all of this films confusion and mystery with a meaningful, satisfying resolution it falls flat.  You may be surprised, but if you don't feel had, you weren't really paying attention. So all of you who claim this to be a highly intelligent psychological thriller, you apparently don't realize the writer of this was also responsible for Jack Frost and its sequel.  It must have been about time for him to create the next thriller/surprise film and try to break into the money-making theatrical market.James Mangold is not without talent and he tries terribly to make this bad script work and it may have, if only he treated it less seriously.  The disorder you will see in Identity is turned cartoon-ish by Hollywood yet again here and if you are a Psychology major like one reviewer here claimed, you shouldn't be thrilled by this film but insulted.  It's only there for the surprise not coherency.  We don't actually know anything about the surprise character either, so when the story turns down a different road it doesn't really work and destroys everything there was good about the movie (unless of course your mind is too locked in ""WOW - I - AM - SUR-PRISED"" mode).  The other plot twist is predictable if you are used to ""who-dun-it horror"" and  ridiculous as well in flashback scenes shown near the film's climax.Cusak turns in an expected good performance here.  Liotta plays another defiant/angry character as he usually does these days but still remains beleiveable and the remaining members of the cast do a good job as well except...Amanda Peet is not a great actress.  Please don't base your review on whether someone is cute or not - it's insulting to those who know and appreciate good filmmaking.  Go watch Blind Date.  She should stick to bad comedies because when she acts out any real emotions in this film it's usually unintentionally funny. Nevertheless she wasn't as terrible as I expected she would be. Pruitt Taylor Vince was clearly miscast but since his character was poorly underwritten as well it didn't matter.  His performance was barely acceptable.Identity is not a total waste.  In fact, it is an improvement over many recent horror outings of the past few months (if I mentioned any of them I'd be too scared someone would respond that they were actually good) though it could be skipped without loss just as well.  See it merely to be entertained, but don't think about it too long to the point of delusion or you'll make it into a masterpiece (like others here have) which it clearly is not. ** out of ****.",4.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Great cast in this predictable and yet surprising film.,"When a nasty storm hits a hotel, ten strangers are stranded within and as they begin to know each other, they discover they are being killed off one by one.This is a really dark film that succeeds in confusing you and gets you wondering whodunnit, I would have been disappointed if it had ended any other way. Identity is a stylish looking film, full of wet, dark imagery that increases the creep factor extensively. The film is also suspenseful throughout, featuring plenty of genuine scares and surprises for the most part. However, as the film continues to run, it becomes obvious that we, the audience, are being set up for a switch in the film's basic premise. I figured out that they were all different personalities, but did not see Liotta being a convict, or the kid being the killer.The direction of the film is seemingly influenced in equal amounts by Fincher, Hitchcock and Agatha Christie, James Mangold has produced an interesting and intriguing piece.Throughout the film, I was impressed with the shooting and general ambiance created. The acting, whilst a tad patchy in places was convincing, and this aided the director in his attempts to inflict upon the audience suspense of Hitchcockian levels.The acting was decent, of course Liotta is as always the hot tempered guy about to blow in every scene, Cusack gives a great performance as always and I was surprised by Peets performance, she hold up with the other great actors on the set as if she had the same amount of acting experience with them. The chemistry was really good as well between the characters, even though most of the time they distrust each other.I essentially believe that this film is worth watching for all fans of a wide range of genres: the thriller, horror, and pure whodunits (especially anyone who has read Christie's And Then There Were None). This is a film that tries to throw a twist in and actually succeeds with it.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A refreshing thriller!,"I'm really getting sick of Hollywood movies. But this one was refreshing. I love Hitchcock movies and this one reminds me of something Hitchcock would have done.This is a movie where you don't want to miss anything. It reminds me of Shutter Island, a story that takes you one way and then blind sides you later on in the movie. Every time I thought I knew who was behind this mess, a new suspect showed up.What I really liked about this movie is that it isn't the standard Hollywood horror movie. It's not some movie where rebellious teenagers run around in their underwear having sex and being hunted down. This movie instead relied on very well developed characters, characters that many people could identify with. It relied on classic plot structure instead of sex and violence.This movie does still have some plot holes. But I was easily able to forgive them because of how good the movie was. I recommend this thriller to people who love thrillers and don't care for the standard Hollywood thriller.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Hands Down the Best Horror Film in Years, as well as the First Great Film of 2003","""As I was going up the stairs, I met a man who wasn't there. He wasn't there again today, I wish I wish he'd go away.""-Certain to become a classic quote among horror movies.Many great things can be said of James Mangold's ""Identity"", but one thing is for sure; hopefully this will inspire future horror films to try something new for a change, which in this case is a clever story. After endless years of such wretched teen horror fare and formulaic retreads, here comes a movie that manages to be both scary and smart. Such films as The Sixth Sense and, more recently, The Ring, have been likewise, but this movie gives both of them a run for their money, big time. It also has what I can easily say is one of the most shocking endings of recent memory. I've seen the movie twice so far, and the ending has stuck with me thus far.With talent like this involved, you'd figure this movie had to have something going for it. It's not everyday you see actors like John Cusack and Ray Liotta in a project like this. You've got to give them credit because they obviously spotted the cleverness of the script. Had this been your run of the mill scare flick, I'm sure they would've passed. The real standout of the cast is John Hawkes, as the shady motel proprietor. Hawkes, who I remember in bit parts in Rush Hour and The Perfect Storm, can easily be compared to Steve Buscemi, but he provides the best lines in the movie, not to mention the funniest.As far as the plot goes, I don't want to reveal anything beyond what the trailer and ads have, which was thankfully not a whole lot. In fact, it's one of the best trailers of recent memory because of that. All that needs to be said is that if you're looking to be really frightened by a movie, but don't want to endure the standard cliches, then ""Identity"" is a must see for you. I certainly hope that it will generate massive box office attention before the summer movie invasion, because it truly deserves to be a hit.**** out of ****",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
It mostly works...,"Identity is a hard film to describe without giving the story away. In fact, every little second of screentime is important to the story, so talking about events is a difficult thing to do without giving away too much. I will try to discuss it in general point form, but if you haven't seen it already, consider yourself advised. Even describing the setup without ruining a surprise is a tough ask.The cast assembled at the hotel is exceptionally strong together, and they give the film all of its impact. John Cusack in particular arrests the viewer and gives them someone to get behind. Amanda Peet turns in a rare performance that I don't hate her in. Ray Liotta makes the plot twist of his character work like only a true professional can do. By the time the film reveals why he's constantly yelling and screaming at everyone who dares to disagree with him, he really manages to get under the viewer's skin.The real surprise in this cast, however, is Jake Busey, who does the Obnoxiously Ugly Contingent Of Hollywood proud. During his screentime, his mannerisms and delivery really sell him as a serial killer. If the viewer isn't afraid of the big unknown that the film sets up, they will definitely be afraid of Jake. The guy is big and authoriative enough to sell the character in spite of so little being known about him. But then, we know very little about any character here, even after they try to explain themselves.As various events conspire to bring the principal cast to a simple hotel that appears to be in the middle of nowhere, we slowly get a feeling something is not quite right here. Soon after everyone arrives, one of the guests is killed, and a keychain found not far from their corpse. The keychain corresponds to the number of the room she is situated in, and so the game begins. Most of the people in the hotel share a room with somebody, but the keychain links things together in a way that is subtle and obvious at the same time.Where the film lapses is the ending. Not only does it feel too abrupt, it has little, if any, lead-in or hint, making it feel as though it was thrown in for the sole purpose of closing the film. Sometimes this isn't so bad, but considering the standard set by the rest of the film, it is a big disappointment. Still, the film entertains for ninety minutes, and that's certainly more than a lot of recent films seem to feel we have a right to ask.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Lots of twists and turns all the way to the end. Love it. The darkness of the setting, coupled with intermittent thunder and the pattering of rain, create an all-encompassing sense of suspense bordering on fear. Rain muffles sound, so how can you hear if someone's sneaking up behind you? Identity is a unique and original film most movie lovers will enjoy.

Possibly one of the greatest psychological thrillers of all time,"Identity is the story of 10 strangers who are stranded at a motel overnight due to rain flooding the roads.The movie unfolds nicely when the people start to die one by one which will keep you guessing until the ending twist which I can promise you will not see coming. The movie can seem a bit predictable but all in all you will be completely surprised by the truth behind the ten strangers. The movie throws out clues here and there and there are some points which leave you totally confused.You will need to concentrate during this movie and whatever you do if you're watching with a friend who has already seen it don't ask them ""hey what just happened there?"", the movie will confuse you but all is explained by the end of the movie. The dialog is great and John Cusack plays a terrific lead role along side Amanda Peet, Ray Liotta and John C Mcginley.The tension grows as the characters slowly start to get killed off which brings the survivors closer as they learn unusual things about each other that they strangely have in common. The fact that the entire movie is at night during a huge storm creates an extra dimension of fear and makes you feel completely unsafe and uneasy during the movie (which is always a great factor in a horror/thriller).The movie does a great job at tricking the audience into believing they know what will happen in the end, and just when you think you've got it, it completely flips on you.This movie proves to be one of the greatest psychological thrillers of all time which adds a whole other dimension of fear and mystery to the film which is unique and delivers everything you expect, and a whole lot more!",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Eternal sunshine of A Twisted Mind !!,"What are the chances for a decent, satisfactory ending for this movie? One in a million! And it hits the nail perfectly, and later hits you in the head several times until you have no choice but accept it.I watched this movie after 6 years of it's original release and I'm very sorry about it; I mean, I had the chance to watch it before but I was reluctant due to my hatred towards Hollywood's idea of making Horror and Thriller films.The plot starts as any 90's slasher and then with the correct pacing, moves to be a whodunit Thriller, and ends up being a thrilling roller coaster mixed with tension, excellent dialog, and nerve tensing twist situations.I can't give you details because it would be very unfair for those who haven't seen it but, I want to convince people like me to watch it...please read.I'm an avid Horror moviegoer and I watch anything related to the genre, and for those who are also hardcore fans, please give this Hollywood product a chance; you won't regret. This is a clever, thrilling, violent and emotional film.You will find great acting specially from super badass Ray Liotta, the always talented John Cusack, the super sexy bomb and my wife (I'm living a dream OK?) Amanda Peet. The rest of the cast is excellent; even Alfred Molina is extraordinary even that he has a few on-screen minutes.The Direction is perfect because it's stylish, has some wild camera angles, and best of all, it keeps developing under a dark atmosphere. Excellent settings and special effects. Plus the gore though minimal is good.The ending will leave you wondering ""what the hell?!"" but in a positive manner. Expect a really good Thriller with excellent ingredients of Horror, Mystery and Suspense. The most important situations will make you feel sad, horrified, but something important is that you will think really hard and feel for the characters.

The unpleasantness continued for a while in typical Hollywood style...and then came the twist.  Most twists in movies are designed to make the story more interesting, or give the audience a new perspective: this one just eradicated any empathy anyone may have had with the characters.

Poop.,"I found this movie to be horrible. At the start, I was almost drawn in but was distressed by the continuity and plot inconsistencies many will notice. Also, the unlikely behavior of the characters made it difficult to grant license and lose myself in the movie. These inconsistencies are explained through a plot device that I have always found unappealing, (if you see the movie you know what the mechanism is) the use of this device and especially the fact that it is revealed halfway through the movie greatly devalues viewer's interest in the outcome, which I found to be thoroughly predictable. Conversely, if the finish hadn't been mostly revealed at that time the continuity errors may have made give up before the end, in short it just doesn't work. The psychological aspect and psychologist scenes are shallow and implausible. I actually think this setting would have worked better as a straight slasher. I also found the lack of gore disappointing. Characters die off in a blink of an eye, the audience has little chance to be fearful for them or develop tension, and only two scenes had any element of suspense at all for me. Once the mystery unravels our empathy for the characters is unraveled as well, and by the last 30 minutes of the film you're just waiting for the credits.",1.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Let no one tell you anything about this movie-just go see it,Watched this lovely little film with Ray Liotta and John Cusack to night. Think Ten Little Indians and then let the story wander.This is a wonderful little thriller that is better the less you know about it. The plot of a group of people being stranded at a motel during a rain storm is the starting point of a tale that should end about two minutes before it does.(The last two minutes are stupid fill in the blanks stuff its not needed and could be considered almost a cop out) I would love to tell you whats going on but I think the less you know the better it is. Although I am looking forward to seeing it again because its a good thriller even if I told you everything.Forgive me this is a really good movie that I want to discuss with someone who's seen it simply because there is so much to love and its so well made despite the bumps in the road.

Near Perfect Psychological Thriller,"Identity has been compared to many films like Fight Club, Saw and even Sixth Sense because of the twist-ending. But that's where the similarities end.Identity is a psychological thriller and by my understanding of the genre, such movies engage the audience by having them intelligently guess who the villain is while distracting them with several twists in the plot. And Identity does that brilliantly.The story is written in your typical 'whodunnit' fashion. A bunch of strangers from different places, leading different lives, get stranded in a motel for the night, no thanks to the convenient timing of torrential downpour. Predictably they get murdered one by one in gruesome manner until the killer is finally found and stopped. Or so you think.Identity is a movie that plays heavily on character development, which to me is something that lacks in modern thrillers. The well-timed flashbacks satisfy the audience's need to know how the strangers ended up in the same place at the same time and the dialog between characters build chemistry. The cast do a great job of keeping the tension by balancing sympathy and suspicion.The movie's twist at the end is fitting. After taunting you for so long the twist is near perfect for those who like their movies with a reasonable explanation of events. All the movie's clichés are immediately forgiven and forgotten.Identity may not be an all-time classic but it doesn't deserve the negative remarks from some reviewers. It is a well-thought out movie that pays attention to detail and makes a sincere effort to end the film as a realistically as possible.Identity is NOT a horror movie as some seem to think although the movie does fool audience into thinking there is some sort of supernatural force at work in the beginning.Saying too much in a review may just give away the numerous twists in the movie so I urge you to just watch it. Give it a try and you may thank yourself for not missing out on one the genre's best.I would recommend this movie to those who enjoyed Seven and The Prestige.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Phenomenal mind-bending thriller that will have you on the edge of your seat,"This movie came recommended to me on Netflix spotlight since I watch so many thrillers/horrors, so I decided to give it a try and was blown away. You may think you know exactly what's going on and exactly what the movie is about, but you cannot predict the direction in which the story is headed until its revealed.First of all, I should point out that although 'Identity' is headed under the horror section on Netflix UK, it's definitely not a horror and although it's very suspenseful, the blood/gore is minimal and it's much more of a psychological thriller than anything else. So for any horror fans looking for a true horror, this may not be for you. However, if you're a fan of mind-bending psychological thrillers with a splash of the slasher sub-genre, this is perfect for you.'Identity' is such a well thought out story that benefits from a talented cast, interesting characters and an intriguing story that is much more complex than it seems on first appearances. Unlike many other movies in the same genre, 'Identity' doesn't extend beyond its reach by throwing unnecessary twists and surprises that are illogical and irrelevant to the overall conclusion. Although the story is complex, every single piece of the puzzle fits together perfectly leaving no unanswered questions or lingering confusion.John Cusak is fantastic as the lead (no surprises there), but the entire cast is strong and give great performances. The characters themselves all had their own personalities and we were introduced to elements of their back-story which made them feel more distinctive as people instead of just a bunch of generic murder victims. The interactions between the characters are equally as strong and there's interesting dynamics that emerge between them immediately. Personally, I was a little confused as to how some of them seemed so familiar to each other so quickly, but just like everything else, it's all explained as the story progresses.I loved the way the twists were revealed because it was done at the perfect time and in a way whereby it was subtle and had you thinking for a few moments longer about what you were being told. But the second the dots connect it evokes an immediate response of awe and surprise. I also appreciated that the story still continued to develop further and progress at a steady pace after the reveal.Overall, this is a fantastic movie that is psychologically stimulating, clever and suspenseful and will have anybody that watches on the edge of their seat guessing what's going to happen next and who the big bad is. The best part is that very few people will figure it out by themselves, because it's THAT unexpected, yet when you know it you can't help but wonder how you didn't see it from the beginning.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Just The Twisty Mystery You Were Searching For. ♦ 82%,"Everyone likes twist endings. Everyone likes mysteries. If you agree with the previous two statements, then Identity should be the next movie you watch.Riddled with amazing performances and character building, Identity starts off dull. Then, it tells the story of 10 people who get stranded in a motel perfectly through co-incidence and while the camera flashes the cause of events, you'll give it a wry smile. What unfolds is a series of mystery-filled occurrences which are enough to keep you hooked. The scientific/medical approach also polishes it and moreover paints the errors off the plot which mainly focuses on crime- investigation. Jaw-dropping bloody sequences & few deep dialogs makes me rate it 8.2/10!I agree the conclusion is kinda hard to understand, but if you look closely, there is a 1:3 chance that you can predict what is what.

"A Smart, Cleverly Constructed Film.","""Identity"" starts off telling the separate stories of ten strangers who coincidentally wind up stranded in the Nevada desert during a torrential rainstorm. Among them are a limo driver, a snobby actress, a police detective transporting a convict, a married couple and their young son, a prostitute, and many other assorted characters who happen to be in the same situation. They all, oddly enough, end up at a small little vacant motel in the desert to escape from the rainstorm, among them being the wife of the married couple who was hit by a car and severely injured. As the night goes on and the strangers begin to know each other a little better, someone begins killing them off one by one. They begin to suspect the convict is responsible for the brutal slayings, but the murders continue throughout the night and each of the strangers learn that they all hold a mysterious secret...I don't want to give to much of the plot away so that's all I'll tell you, but trust me, you won't be disappointed with this film. I saw this movie back during it's theater release a few years ago, and I was blown away by it all. It's really a great film - not just a great horror film, but just as a film in general. The story to this film is amazing, I have to give some serious credit to the writers because it was so well done. This has to be one of the most original films of it's type, and for that it succeeds very well with me. As the film progresses toward the shocking conclusion, pieces of the puzzle begin to come together in a way that you wouldn't have even imagined before. There were some really scary sequences in the film also that were very well-directed, especially the bathroom attack on the Ginny character - scared the hell out of me. The performances in the film were also excellent, and the film boasts a fairly impressive cast - among them being John Cusack, Ray Liotta, Amanda Peet, Alfred Molina, Clea DuVall, Rebecca DeMornay, and others. Each of the performances were great, the cast was perfect and played their characters very well.The setting for this movie was perfect - the small, cheap little motel is a perfect backdrop for all of the gruesome happenings. In fact, it reminded me a little of the infamous Bates Motel in Hitchock's classic ""Psycho"", the similarities being that the motel was in the desert and the overall layout of it all. Is it a reference to ""Psycho""? Possibly, I can't really say for sure though. Along with the all of the pluses mentioned above, the cinematography was really excellent, the film was shot very stylishly. Everything was very washed down, dark, and ominous, a perfect manner for this film to be presented in, giving it a much more mysterious feel.The bottom line is, ""Identity"" is one of the smartest, cleverly constructed horror/thrillers in quite some time. It was creepy, mysterious, had me wondering throughout the entire movie, and the conclusion that tied everything together was a real shocker.

A one man movie,"This movie is a great thriller. The story is really coll and good actors portraying it.

Didn't see it coming...totally original.,"I first learned of Identity when I heard Ebert and Roepert (hope that is spelled correctly) give this horror/thriller ""two thumbs up.""  I love those Sixth Sense/The Others type of movies and their reviews made me think Identity would be something I would want to watch. When the killings began my first thought was that this movie blows.  Oh my God what were those two critics thinking...this is playing out like a 13 Ghosts type of flick.  Then the plot twist and I literally yelled out at in the theatre, ""Oh my God I never saw that coming...this is great."" The idea for this movie is totally original and completely justified the highly unorthodox (and somewhat comical) methods of murder that were taking place. Ive heard a few complaints about the ending, and although I agree the same was a little bit forseeable, it was still highly entertaining. Overall, I loved the film.  Although, I wish they would have stretched it out more than 90 minutes.  Nonetheless, loved Identity...very original...will recommend it in the same breath as The Others and The Sixth Sense.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Written by Donald Kaufman,"It's quite frankly bizarre that this movie was predicted by Charlie Kaufman in 2002 ""Adaptation"", complete with the nonsensical plot twist.With one of the most incredibly put together ensemble cast, no one could blame you for thinking ""identity"" would have been amazing. Sadly, it uses one. of the most tired, contrived plots to force a 'surprise' ending which make no sense whatsoever.It's well paced, (mostly) well shot and lit , and (mostly) very well acted, which explains the relatively high rating, and for that myself I'll give it 3 stars.However, it eschews some of the basic rules of screenwriting at its own risk and peril, leaving us unsatisfied and disappointed by its formulaic approach overall.Real shame.",3.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Probably the best Thriller/Suspense film ever made!,"Identity maybe the best thriller film of all time considering that it has all the elements and a unique substance that holds this film together and, simply, it just is a unique masterpiece by James Mangold. James Mangold is a visionary director who has made great films like 3:10 to Yuma, Walk The Line, Girl, Interrupted but even though they maybe great, Identity easily tops that list in a flash. James Mangold uses a lot of twists and sometimes confusing puzzles to make you like this film and out of nowhere the puzzle will be answered with a new brilliant twist. Even though I give films ten stars, it still does not mean that they are perfect but with a film like this, it is a whole different case. Identity and a lot of other ten star films surely do come to be perfect. A few centimeters more and they will become my next best friend. Gosh, how could I have thought that this would be time wasting? How could I think that this will be crap? How could I think something bad about this? Answer = Stupidity. This film defines the ""Don't Judge a Movie By Its Cover"" tagline. Now to the acting and performances by the crew in this film. John Cusack is in his game with this film as he plays a likable ex-cop turned limo driver, who ends up in a motel that is in the middle of nowhere along with more people who, mysteriously, all have a connection to each other. His acting is what defines acting in a good way and when I mean that, I am f*king dead serious. Ray Liotta is also another performer to watch out for because he portrays someone who knows more than he is letting on. I love his scary, yet deadly secret. Liotta acts beautifully and convincingly all the way till we find more about him. Amanda Peet plays a prostitute who is heading for a place to start a new life specializing in growing oranges, who also, strangely, goes to the motel. Amanda is strong in this film and near flawless. Before I go on, you might be wondering that why are they all ending up in a motel. Answer = it is raining and the streets are flooded. Alfred Molina is unrecognizable as he plays Dr.Mallick and I didn't even know that he was performing in this film if it wasn't for the credits. Nevertheless, he still does a great job. The plot is greatly crafted and engaging from the first scene. The storytelling which is seen from all sides is quite clever and adds a little bit more depth to the whole film. The cinematography is outstanding and spooky because, since it's raining, with no where to go, you have no choice but to go to a motel where you are wondering who is going to die first. The rainy setting is the perfect setting for this psychological thriller. The atmosphere also has a clear sense of horror stuck to it, a perfect atmosphere for a film. This review is all positives but no negative. Erm......The film is too scary!! That is my only concern - thank you! I am ranting on too much about this film but that is hard to since I wanna tell you all about it and why you should watch it. One: Great acting. Two: Brilliant cinematography. Three: Great twists. Four: likable characters. Must Watch!!! I highly recommend this to anyone, children and adults alike since I am not a classification freak like some, but the only concern I have is that it has a confusing story that takes a lot of time to figure out but if you want to have a go at it.... please do.Strangers from all different walks of life: a limo driver escorting a movie star, parents with a young son, a cop transporting a convict, a prostitute, a young couple, and a motel manager are caught up in a nasty rainstorm, stuck at a motel in desolate Nevada. Soon they realize they may be at the motel for another reason when one by one, people start getting killed off. As tensions flare and fingers are pointed, they have to get to the bottom of why they're there. Meanwhile in an undisclosed location, a psychiatrist is trying to prove the innocence of a man accused of murder in an eleventh hour trial. How these two through-lines are related can only be found in Identity.Minor spoilers hereon: When you find out that they all have the same birthday and are named after a state or country, you are think WTF! but the ending tells you why this is what it is. The waiting to find out what happens is really annoying because with a film like this, storytelling has to be fast and clear at the same time. The story about the ""Indian Cemetery"" is a really scary mini-story that gives you something to think about. It is haunting as well. The ending was great and unexpected so you don't really know what is happening until PANG you are hit in the face with an unbelievable twist. The boy who, reportedly, dies is quite scary to think about. The funny thing is that, if you have watched the film, John Cusack is actually a fat, bald guy. For a reason I found that funny. My words are running out.....Damn!! The original score is great and adds a bit more creepiness to the film which will make you enjoy it way more. The uniqueness of this film is very rare and hard to find nowadays in film. The ""I met a man who wasn't there..."" poem is frightening and greatly written. The voice that says that adds a bit more effect to the hauntingness of it. Should definitely be on you ""Must Watch list!"" 10/10 - A Masterpiece! Bravo!""Over and out."" 24 March 2010.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Horror with brains.,"I watched this movie without having an idea what it was about. It surprised me and I enjoyed it very much. It's recommendable to watch this movie without reading or hearing too much about it at first. I think that way you'll appreciate the movie more.It begins as a kind of drama then it slowly turns into an horror movie, a thriller and a supernatural thriller. The way the story is build up is unique and works surprising well. Unlike many other movies from its genre, the story is complicated and plays a significant role. Horror with brains.The movie never seize to surprise. The movie is full with plot twists, from beginning till the end. Highly recommendable for people who like to be surprised by a movie, even though real smart people already see the ending coming from miles away.There is a nice Hitchcock like atmosphere and some great characters played by highly talented actors. Another significant difference with other movies from its genre.Let this movie surprise you.9/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Good film with an interesting ending,"The film starts well enough, detailing the way each person got to the motel and their circumstances in an entertaining way. Once they reach the motel, the film does a great job at shifting the blame between the different characters to the point in which you believe all can be guilty.As shown in other reviews, the ending is very divisive. Personally, I found it to be an interesting and welcome twist. While it majorly changes how we view the events prior to it and the few that follow the twist, it gave a unique way to look at the struggle between the characters and a new meaning to their survival.Overall, I liked the film a lot, ending included, and highly recommend it.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Good Atmospheric Thriller,"Really enjoyed this film. Well structured and pretty unique telling of a good thought provoking story.We tried to work out what was happening and must admit to failing miserably up until the last ten minutes. In its own way the film was actually pretty pacey and I think it worked better being only some 90 minutes long. It might have dragged a little being any longer. Thought all of the characters were good and added to the overall mood of the film.The story may well be not as original as we thought it was but it kept our interest with all the various twists. It relied upon the plot, script and acting to keep it going and all in all it worked very well.We saw it on a recommendation and would likewise recommend it to anyone.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

After the third installment of the Scream Trilogy where they used the same wore out story line I didn't think it was possible for Hollywood to come up with anything that hadn't been used a thousand times before, but with Identity they actually delivered.  I really enjoyed this movie.  I have always loved movies where there is a mystery to figure out and this one had a good one.  I thought the acting was good including John Cusack's.

Awful Truth,No Spoilers ahead.Compare SPIDER by Cronenberg to this piece of maintenance. I've seen the flick in the German dubbed language.

Slasher or Psychological thriller?,"While not the best movie ever made, Identity will keep you guessing until the end just what is going on.  Fairly quickly you will deduce not all is as it seems.  As more details are presented, the idea of a supernatural cause becomes more and more realistic; yet, at no point does the movie seem supernatural.Is this a slasher movie?  In the classic sense, yes.  There are murders. There is blood.  There is a knife, a bat, a gun, even an exploding car. But in the end, the hows of the murders are unimportant.The best hint to give to understand this movie is simple: pay close attention to all the details and make no assumptions.  Upon recollection of all the details, it becomes VERY obvious what is going on.Kudos for keeping the suspense going and allowing the audience to make their own minds over what happens.  It may seem obvious, yet a very enjoyable journey to get there.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Superb - Twists and Turns Galore!,"I really knew nothing about this film before watching it, and was keen to watch it mostly because I am a bit of a fan of John Cusack - though I tend not to be much of a fan of Thriller films.But I really enjoyed this film! Essentially, this is a murder mystery in a classic scenario of 'group of people trapped in a location (a motel) with someone killing them off one by one'.I don't want to spoil the film for you, so all I can say is that at first the emphasis of the story, for the viewer, is 'whodunnit', and of course there are opportunities to consider almost all the group... However, something then happens so that you have to reevaluate what you are watching. The emphasis remains on 'whodunnit' - even though your framing of that question will have changed. Then something else happens, so you have to reevaluate again, and so on.I can only assume that the people who did not like this film are the sort of people who will not have liked 6th Sense because ghosts don't exist do they? My point being, most films need you to suspend your belief in some way, and I found that this film at least explained most if not all issues very well.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery

A truly knockout,"Suspicion, depression, and despair, what a goddamn raining night with such a horrible motel it is! Characters are described step by step as the plot goes on, and the end gives me so many surprise. Identity somehow use the movie technique of Momento, several lines go to a final destination to describe a story, but it is more reasonable in reasoning. From the beginning, I suspect that the cop himself is the criminal, but I never thought about the mean actor of the movie, a former cop who is so tough and calm in such a situation could be one of the character ,or we say fiction of that psycho, less to think that boy could be the final cold blooded killer! Yes, he is, the final scene told us everything and every answers to those painstaking riddles.Every character in this movie performs well. Different characteristic and the basic responding to the tough situation. The camera is also good and if it not mimic Momento, I would give it a much higher score, anyway, this film could be a must-see in 2003",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Faaantastic!!!,"Great film folks! I completely agree on Cusack and went from being a Cusack admirer to a Cusack fan after seeing Identity.

Outstanding performances by McGinley and Peet, and an amazing job done by Alfred Molina. You will see what Im talking about. Film kept me guessing, wondering, and most of all, reflecting.

A slasher-movie by any other name....,"This film starts intriguingly as various people find themselves thrown together at a motel during a rainstorm. Interesting characters and the always charismatic John Cusack doing his thing. But then the killings start, character-development and relationships are set aside, and the film gradually goes gorily downhill to its' quite batty denouement and really ho-hum final 'shock' moment. But then I don't particularly like these sort of who's-doing-it films because I always get the feeling that it doesn't matter who is doing it, it is only a writers' contrivance. And this is more contrived than most, with the ludricous assumption that the State Governor would sit through a therapy session with a murderous lunatic the night before the mans' execution and then take the psychiatrists' word that the clearly demented man was now cured. Oh, come on, I thought -- and knew instantly how the film would end. Oh well. Cusack is always a pleasure -- and Amanda Peet, Ray Liotta and Jonn McGinley head an good cast....",4.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Finally Cusack separates himself from the love comedies.,"John Cusack, Ray Liotta, Amanda Peet, Jake Busey, John Hawkes, Alfred Molina, Clea Duvall, and William Lee Scott. Directed by James Mangold.After waiting six years since Simon West's Con Air for John Cusack to do a movie other than the corky love comedies he pulls through with Identty. Whether he play a witty record salesman (High Fidelity) or a struggling hit man (Grosse Pointe Blank) but now he steals the show as a limo driver (well technically I thought Liotta stole the show).The story is set in a Nevada motel during a horrible rain storm causing ten complete strangers to battle out the storm. But as they begin to get to know each other the killing starts. Identity is a pulse pumping thriller and a mind game leaving you guessing until the end of the film. One of the best thrillers since The Usual Suspects. My final rating 8/10.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery

The plot and storyline were very interesting and very exciting to follow, I was impressed at the twists and turns taken by the script.  There were no spectacular Oscar performances by the actors, but hey, what does the Academy know right? I was impressed with the acting of all characters and each one added to the ever growing character of Larry!  They all did a recognizable job!

Storyline,"""Identity"" (2003), directed by James Mangold, is a psychological thriller that masterfully plays with the audience's perception of reality. It's a film that thrives on its intricate plot twists, creating a suspenseful and unsettling experience. Here's a deeper look:
* A Complex Narrative:
* The film presents two seemingly separate storylines that gradually converge. One involves a group of strangers stranded at a remote motel during a violent rainstorm, where they begin to be murdered one by one. The other follows a convicted killer undergoing psychiatric evaluation.* The genius of ""Identity"" lies in its ability to weave these threads together, revealing a shocking connection that recontextualizes everything that has come before.* Psychological Thriller Elements:
* The film delves into themes of identity, perception, and the human psyche. It explores the idea of fragmented personalities and the internal struggles that can arise from mental illness.* The sense of paranoia and distrust among the motel guests creates a palpable atmosphere of tension, keeping viewers on the edge of their seats.* Twists and Turns:
* ""Identity"" is renowned for its unexpected plot twists. The film's ability to constantly subvert expectations is a key element of its success.* The ending in particular, is one that causes the viewer to have to rethink everything that they have just seen.* Strong Performances:
* The ensemble cast, featuring John Cusack, Ray Liotta, and Amanda Peet, delivers compelling performances that enhance the film's sense of realism.* Each actor plays a very important role in the complex story, and they do a great job of it.* Impact and Legacy:
* ""Identity"" has garnered a reputation as a modern classic of the psychological thriller genre. Its intricate plot and thought-provoking themes have resonated with audiences and critics alike.* It is a film that rewards repeat viewings, as each subsequent watch reveals new layers of complexity.In conclusion, ""Identity"" is a masterfully crafted thriller that excels in its ability to manipulate the audience's perception of reality. It's a film that stays with you long after the credits roll, prompting reflection on the nature of identity and the complexities of the human mind.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Not even close to a level of a Mulholland Drive, but it is Lynch-like in some ways.

Great story but not terribly scary,"I'm a big fan of ""scary movies,"" but never really get scared in any of them. So I didn't think this was scary, but neither did the friends I went with who are scared of scary movies.  It's definitely intense in the theater, but don't expect to have nightmares or freak out if you're sleeping alone that night. With that said, despite the fact that it wasn't scary, I thought it was a great movie!  I love original story lines, and this was one that I'd never seen before.  The twist is completely unpredictable, but I think it's good to not always know what's going to happen.  I was totally surprised by The Sixth Sense and The Usual Suspects, but I think I liked those movies better because they weren't your typical ""'good' guy's going to win because everybody likes a happy, predictable ending"" kind of movie.  I suppose if you go into this movie thinking you're going to figure everything out from subtle clues, you're probably going to come out disappointed.

Fast Moving and Entertaining,"I rented this last night and had no idea what was I getting. I knew most of the stars: John Cusak, Rebbeca Demornay (who I hadn't seen in movies for a while) and even Alfred Molina (who had a brief role in the 1st Indiana Jones movie). I actually thought I was going to dislike this movie because I had never heard anything about it. I guess that was my blessing, because IDENTITY was actually all the contrary: a fast moving, action packed and entertaining movie. You have to pay close attention to the beginning of IDENTITY, since an important premise is given and is later brought up to round up the film. On the surface, IDENTITY is about 10 people who meet in a run down motel in the middle of Nevada, on a heavy stormy night. They stay at the motel because of the heavy rain and because the roads are blocked. Among the people is an ex-cop turned limo driver (John Cusak), a has-been movie star (Rebecca Demornay), a recently retired prostitute (Amanda Peet), a Cop (Ray Liotta) driving a murderous convict (Jake Busey) to another Estate, a husband with a wounded wife and his,a young couple and the motel owner. These characters then start being murdered one by one with NO apparent reason or motive. This is where the real suspense begins. It's got enough gory murders to appeal to any bloodthirsty, fango crazy movie lover, but everything is done with the style of a big budget production.. All I can say is that what you are watching is not what it appears to be. I enjoyed IDENTITY a lot, especially John Cusak's performance (you see him in mostly comedy films) and proves that he can do the serious act very well.

"clever little thriller movie, but not original","Identity is a very interesting film as it manages to create a very good atmosphere, where fear and darkness is always in the air. it has a good script, the acting is strong, and its not the average type of slasher film that ussually come out of america, so it stands out. However this movie is not at all original, no matter how well done its filmed. It actually reminds me 3 films and i think it has taken their basic ideas and made it into one movie. Those are final destination, ussual suspects and primal fear. Final destination gives the idea of the patern of the deaths with the key numbers, ussual suspects gives the idea of the fake character story that all have something in common and you dont discover this till the end, and primal fear the multiple personality aspect. offcource it borrows things from other films too, like from hitchkok's type of films, with the single location type of shooting and spooky atmosphere and more.....so to sum up, i really enjoyed this movie, cusack and liota are 2 actors i dont really like a lot, but their performances here were prety good. Well worth to check, i give it an 8 and if it was more original it would have been higher",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Film suffers from identity crisis,"IDENTITY has an interesting if somewhat trite idea at its core. Unfortunately, the execution and the script destroy the whole concept. In order for a story like IDENTITY to work, the characters had to be compelling 3-dimensional folks with depth. Without interesting characters, the storyline suffers so much that the whole thing ends up feeling like a waste of time and a cheat. Had the characters been compelling, the sketchy concept would have worked because the movie-going audience would have believed the killer would have actually spent time in creating these people (or muses) and would rather spend time with them, and tormenting them, instead of the killer being alone with himself and tormenting himself.As of now, the characters in IDENTITY are so boring and forgettable, or interchangeable, that it makes me wonder why would the killer even bother coming up with them? Or why would anyone in the audience care about these people, or types, at all? The film ends up being totally pointless and very predictable, and because of this, IDENTITY is surely one of the worst films I've seen in a while. If it wasn't for the excellent cinematography, which was crisp and beautiful on the DVD, I wouldn't have given this film 4 stars, more like 1 star.Don't bother watching it.",4.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Positively surprised,"I was positively surprised by the film. First of all that was Rebecca DeMornay?! She looked really familiar but I didn't recognize her.Great story and with enough twists to keep me guessing. I really enjoyed it.The movie managed to creep me out just in the right kind of way. Especially near the end when Cusack's character is figuring out what the connection is with the driving licences.Jake Busey as Robert Maine was good, although a small role. He freaked me out in Contact and he managed to freak me out in this one as well.The movie wasted Clea DuVall's talent though with that small role.Pruitt Taylor Vince, I LOVE that guy.

Engaging thriller that deflates halfway through,"Identity quickly sets itself up as a tightly-drawn whodunnit mystery thriller. As 10 strangers (including John Cusack, Ray Liotta, John C. McGinley, Clea Duvall, Rebecca DeMornay, Amanda Peet, Jake Busey) come together in a rundown desert motel during a rainstorm, suspicions and fear among them rise when it appears their is a killer in their midst. Adding the intrigue are the seemingly unconnected scenes of a late-night hearing of a would-be sent-to-death serial taking place far, far away from the motel.For about 60 minutes, this 90-minute movie keeps you hooked. Then it sets about breaking all the rules it has set up and massive gaps in logic distract your attention from the increasingly preposterous climax. I can honestly say I never saw the twist coming. But it came too early and led the film into stupidness.It is atmospherically shot and the feeling of isolation is quite cool, even if it doesn't last very long. But, in the end, I've seen episodes of Midsomer Murders that are far better than this. But what do you expect from a film written by the guy who wrote Jack Frost 2: Revenge of the Mutant Killer Snowman.The DVD is in 2.35:1 anamorphic widescreen with Dolby 5.1 sound.

"great plot, executed well, with a twist","There are very few intelligent, scary/suspenseful movies made in Hollywood. Identity, however, is one of them. Is it perfect? No: Identity follows the formula of recent thrillers (Sixth Sense, Hide and Seek, etc.) where there is a slow build-up, sprinkled with suspenseful moments, to a revelatory climax. Some of the writing is hokey and clumsy at times and the characters can be cartoon-like and one-dimensional (Liotta and Hawkes). But I either overlooked that or simply embraced it and enjoyed it. So it's not an indie film or a foreign film (you decide if that's good or bad). But it is a somewhat different, and surprisingly well-made Hollywood film. Identity was entertaining, thought-provoking, scary, suspenseful, and funny. What else do you want?",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Like being on a carnival ride!,"This films takes one of the more common of film plots, that of strangers stranded together while they are murdered one by one, and delivers a entirely new twist to the proceedings. Everyone has some little secret that is slowly brought out to the viewer, and everyone also has a reason to kill one or more of the others. Each time a secret was revealed I'd think ""Well, that's it - he's the killer!"" (or ""She's the killer!"") until I'd labeled just about everyone that way. I even considered the ""least likely suspect"" as the killer just so I wouldn't be hoodwinked by the plot, and wouldn't you know it - each ""Least likely suspect"" starts dying off as well. It rains throughout this movie so much that the rain itself becomes a character to consider as the suspect. Then there's all that talk about the motel they are staying at as being built on top of an Indian burial ground. There's so many twists and turns that by the time the movie is over you almost feel like you've been on a carnival ride for two hours. Well done!",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Overrated and pointless; skip this one,"Is this real? I mean, it's a pretty hokey film. I didn't even know they made stuff like this. Starts off alright, then becomes really great, and then tapers off with a really ridiculous plot twist. Really, this was a perfectly good crime thriller until they introduce the twist, and then it all starts to slowly fall apart. Maybe to some people it seems fine, but I don't like it at all. It feels like the retarded little brother of Memento and The Machinist, trying to be those films, yet coming out just slightly skewed. And under all of that gloss, it's just a slasher film, a Friday the 13th write off. Really doesn't look too good to write about this one on paper, rather than watching it. This movie feels very fake and artificial by the end, an attribute to which the plot twist does NOT help in the least, and it really unravels down to the bare bones of it's mediocrity with the absolutely horrible ending.But this film isn't without moments, for it's rather enjoyable for the bulk of it's duration. Before the plot twist, you're really fired up and enjoying this one. I know I was. The interactions between characters and all of the kills are pretty enjoyable, but, it just keeps coming back to how bad it gets in the last 15 minutes or so.

"No psychology, no thrills, just lots of rain and noise.","'Identity' is unoriginal and lacks much in the way of suspense or thrills. It does have lots of rain. There's lots of noise; lots of shouting and screaming. Occasional frantic action, violence and a few dead bodies. Confused looks.Basically it's 'Psycho' meets '10 Little Indians' but without the direction, acting or script of either. Most of the first half hour passes before there's any indication of what it's all about and even then it's not at all clear what's going on. After that, it's confused and confusing; the characters are one-dimensional and lifeless, and I couldn't have cared less about them.

I found it to be a real good psychological thriller - and though the director pulled the rug out from under you a few times when you looked back at everything - it all makes sense.  You can complain about some things being predictable or convenient, but to see a movie that was scarier for what you heard but did not see instead of just filling the screen with gore was definitely welcome.

Wow,"Yes, Wow.. and I mean it.  This was a very intelligent film that I was afraid that it wouldn't live up to what the trailer offered for it.  Well it not only lives up to it, it surpasses it.  This movie starts off seeming like it would be a paint-by-numbers 'knock-em-off and guess who the killer is out of who is left' kind of flick.  Then it's like the writer turns around from the driver's seat and says, ""Ok now you really want to see where we're going?""   Then he presses the 4 Wheel Drive button and off you go into the unpaved and bumpy terrain of suspense and thrills.There is no way to guess how this all is going to turn up from the beginning..  nay.. even half way through the film.  It's not till enough of the puzzle is even mentioned that you could even fashion a guess at what is going on.  But trust me, that's a good thing.I'll tell you guys now, the writer of this also was responsible for ""Jack Frost"" (yes the slasher one) and its sequel.  But if ""Identity"" is any evidence of what this guy is capable of then I have no problems offering him the opportunity to thrill my movie prying eyes again.It was really really well done and as I said, very intelligent.  I put it on the intelligence level of smarter films like ""The Usual Suspects"", ""Memento"", and ""The Sixth Sense"".As I said to a friend about this, to make ""Identity"" take one part Agatha Christie, add one part slasher film, and sprinkle a touch of ""Primal Fear"" and mix thoroughly.Nice one, Michael.

By the end of the movie, I was blown away by the way the twist is used as an opportunity to say some serious things about identity and self awareness. The root of Greek tragedy from the Iliad on is the subjectivity of self knowledge and this movie has stayed with me.

The overdone ""sunny fields"" to cheesey ""Children of the Corn""-esque ending ruined this for me.We knew Liotta's character was no good from seeing his back early in the movie, but I think they overplayed the whodunit shifting a little too much during the course of the movie.Again, the concept was good, just not carried to fruition.

"Tight, neat little puzzle.","10 strangers drift from one reason or another into a small motel in the middle of a desert during a heavy storm. Suddenly people start ending up dead and the chase for the murderer begins.There's nothing new in this particular plot line as such, there are lots of this kind of stories ranging from the books of Agatha Christie to dozens of adaptations and transmutation of the story in different media. So, as it often is, it's the way the story is constructed and how the twist is made.It often happens, that this genre gives out so much rope, that it hangs itself, but this doesn't happen with 'Identity'. Despite of some pretty old clichés the movie delivers very enjoyable experience, which explains pretty neatly everything that has happened in the story.It far too easy to say too much about this genre and spoil the fun for the viewers, so I keep this as tight as possible. They enjoyment of the puzzle is laid before your eyes and it is a tasty one.A short summary of what is stated above: very good addition to the genre it presents.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A genuine treat for old-school and new-school horror fans alike,"Unquestionably one of the brightest lights on the spotty landscape of 21st Century horror, Identity fuses the best elements of modern macabre with strong nods to the classic slasher films of the genre's past, and enough tightly-executed twists to drive several films.The plot is basically an updated riff on Agatha Christie's Ten Little Indians (it's even mentioned in the film), with 10 strangers steered by fate to converge at a desolate motel during a sinister storm. The torrential rain renders all outbound roads flooded and strands the group without cell phone reception or even radio contact. Naturally, these marooned guests start being killed off one by one, and as the dwindling survivors struggle to identify the murderer in their midst, they gradually discover that they may have more in common than they suspect, and something far more malevolent than simple coincidence may be responsible for their common plight.If done right, this basic storyline would be more than enough meat to shape an entertaining thriller, but Identity isn't content to settle for being a straight-forward whodunnit. Here, discovering who the victims are is just as crucial as outing the killer, and even after the grand design of the murders has been revealed, the film rolls out one final swerve that turns what we though we knew upside down and concludes the tale on a grim, ghoulish note.I won't spoil any of the myriad twists for you here, but part of what makes Identity such a well-crafted creation is how well is stands up to repeated viewings once you know how the whole thing turns out. The skillful placement of the jigsaw pieces makes this a fun puzzle to assemble even after you've seen the completed picture, and supplementary visits to this morbid motel reveal the intricacies of the broader mystery.Of course, the excellent cast is key to the experience. Playing directly against type, John Cusack proves to be a fantastic lead for a thriller, and the novel placement of Cusack in a horror film is enough on its own to warrant a look at Identity. Ray Liotta is pretty much great in every movie he turns up in, and Amanda Peet essays a strong heroine who continues the refreshing tradition of resourceful female characters which have become a dependable genre presence since Scream mocked and shattered the hysterical ""chicks in peril"" archetypes of horror's past. The ensemble is rounded out by a slew of solid character actors, whose battling personalities ratchet up the tension within the claustrophobic locale.Though a couple of the murders are clearly telegraphed, the majority of the deaths in Identity arrive in surprising ways, and the unpredictability factor lends the film an aura of meticulously chiseled dread and suspense. Admittedly, it's not hard to figure out who's going to be around for the climax, but since the film holds one more turn up its sleeve at that point, even the fairly standard resolution ends up being a set up for something bigger.There's plenty of gore to please fans of old school splatter, as well a few sturdy scares, so since this is ultimately just a thoughtful update of the standard stalk-and-slash formula, we end up being grateful to the film-makers for not settling for a purely mainstream thriller at the expense of sacrificing the pure horror elements.Despite the renaissance the horror genre has enjoyed in the new century, very few genuine classics have emerged from the pack, and for those of us weaned on the iconic films of the '70s and '80s, the bulk of the contemporary fright flicks have been hollow imitators (and, increasingly, blasphemous ""re-imaginings"") of those legendary offerings. Identity balances the best of both schools, managing to be both familiar and original at once, and this terse, unrelenting exercise in bare bones horror is an enthralling and enjoyable ride. Highly recommended.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

A hair-raising thriller that will have you rethinking the entire movie as you leave the theater.,"If you like your movies to adhere to stock Hollywood formulas and endings that can be foreseen twenty minutes in to the picture, then ""Identity"" is definitely not a movie for you.  At first, the picture appears to be a somewhat conventional horror movie where unrelated guests stranded at a remote Nevada motel in a driving rainstorm are being systematically killed in gruesome fashion.Even then, the superb acting carries the film - especially John Cusack as a limo driver trying to do the right thing and Amanda Peet as a world-wise prostitute.  Eventually a parallel and seemingly unrelated story about a convicted killer who is about to be executed unless his lawyer can get him committed to an insane asylum begins to make its connection to the motel felt.Without giving anything away, it will make your head spin and have you reexamining everything you have seen in order to figure out this brilliant puzzle.

The way she played off John Cusack's character, Edward, was also really great - their chemistry on screen was palpable and added to the film's emotional depth. What really impressed me, though, was how Peet was able to make Paris feel like a fully fleshed-out person, even though we don't know that much about her backstory. She just had this presence on screen that drew me in and made me want to know more about her character.

Ludicrous Thriller,"A group of strangers is stranded at a remote motel on a stormy night, as a killer strikes.

As the victims start falling, the film becomes increasingly ludicrous until it reaches a mind-blowing, idiotic resolution.
